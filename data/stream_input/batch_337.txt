B0000A1RJI|5.0|Wow, loved this.  I bought it as a birthday present for my sister and haven't stopped listening to it since.  I will never get tired of it!!  It is exciting, suspenseful, at times sad, and everyone would like this!  If I could, I would rate it as a million stars.  Five is an understatement! : )  Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho!!
B000002C2E|5.0|Dylan..... in the essential blues form of all his great musical art gets DOWN with it in no uncertain terms. Leadbelly:.... listen up! This is the american pop poet treking all along the roadhouse line. The appex of his journey... so far!
0451169514|5.0|Yes, you read that correctly. Don't say that I have read only horror and fantasy - I have read Remarque, Asimov, Vidal etc. These authors are also great but in most books I have read something's missing. For example the feeling of reality, the atmosphere of the book, the sense that you are there. I feel as if I have been in Derry(the city where the action of \\"It\\" takes place), I have walked on its streets and seen its creepy canals... The people who say that the book is too long should consider the fact that this is the only way to create realistic scenery  for the haunting activities described in the book.<br /> Stephen King is known for his incredible, living characters and in this book he shows that even more than usual. There is not a poorly done character in the whole cast, all seem real and I feel them as if they are my friends or enemies. Even the minor characters are magnificently  incorporated into the big picture and seem exactly where they should be. <BR>  The book seems to be slow paced at first but after we get to Ben's memories from childhood it picks up and never stop up to the grand finale which in stark contrast with other King books is really well-done. The book is also packed with great emotins- every time I read some scenes, especially the end I nearly cry and I have never cried to any book.<BR>  This is not your usual horror book - I don't think it is horror book at all. It is about lost childhood, bravery, loyality and most importantly - friendship. But you should see that yourself when you read \\"It\\".<BR>  On the negative side - thre's only the infamous sex-scene at the end but if you aren't too big of a puritan I don't think that would be such a big deal.
B000089RVX|5.0|Ok, this band is hard to describe, since they have change their way of performing and way of singing. I love this band for the beat of their beat of the music. There seems to be no bad song on this album. I do nhot like how they play the Christian market. But I am judgeing by their music, and it deserves a 5.
0385504209|1.0|Save yourself the time and the $$$<br />This book lies all about Jesus and the apostles and Christianity entirely.  Why has it topped the LA Times Best Seller List for Fictional works for 22 solid weeks?<br />GOD ONLY KNOWS, but I wish He'd stop it.
B00005JKDQ|4.0|Another winner from Pixar. The movie is about a group of monsters who scare small children by emerging from their closet. Their screams are used to power their city. The problem is that the monsters are more afraid of the children. They believe that contact with a child is fatal. Well an extemely adorable two year old girl accidently enters their world and causes a panic. She befriends the top scarer John Sullivan who bonds with the child. Sullivan and his friend Mike desperately ties to get the child back home. THe movie is funny as well as very sweet escpecially the relationship between SUllivan and the child. <br />The animation is quite good and very detailed. Every stand of fur on sullivans body moves independantly giving the look of real fur. I saw specials on how they made this possible. It seams every new animation feature furthwer sets the mark for computer animation.
B000069AUI|5.0|Brilliant! Chris Martin and crew have returned with their sophomore followup to \\"Parachutes,\\" and they certainly have not dissappointed. If \\"Yellow\\" hadn't originally clued you in to Coldplay's existence (I know I didn't really care), then you are certain to know them by now by their Grammy winning album \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" one of the best albums of 2002 by far. <br />I had liked \\"Yellow,\\" and purchased \\"Parachutes\\" afterwards. It was pretty good, but it wasn't something I listened to that often. But Coldplay has certainly grown from that. Unlike \\"Parachutes,\\" they don't just throw together a bunch of random words, but this time carefully craft them to make a wonderful collection of 11 songs. <br />\\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" as the title suggests, gives you a lot to think about. Every song is a winner on here. It starts off with the powerful \\"Politik,\\" a perfect leadoff song that sets the pace and the questions and longing to be explored throughout the album, in which he begs \\"Give me peace, reserve control/Give me heart and give me soul.\\" That message sets the basis of the rest of the tracks. I hold a special liking for \\"In My Place,\\" the first single off the album that wasn't really given much radioplay, but deserved it beyond many others at the time. Martin strains against \\"the lines that [he] couldn't change,\\" with wonderful lyrics to back his point. Other hits include \\"The Scientist,\\" in which Martin tells the listener \\"I'll take you back to the star,\\" which is a nice reference to \\"Yellow,\\" showing that the band hasn't forgotten the roots from which this album has grown from. \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" is a nice, uplifting ballad, with a nice tune to boot, and the radio-friendly \\"Clocks\\" has now become a timeless classic for our generation. Those first five songs are worth the album already. But don't overlook the other songs. The progression from a stronger to a weaker vocal background in \\"Warning Sign\\" is just buried with emotion, while \\"A Whisper\\" ironically shouts at us \\"Night turns to day and I still have these questions/You just won't break, should I go forwards or backwards?\\"<br />If this album was a book, this would be a book you could analyze for a college class. But that's a good thing! \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is packed with philosophy backed with wonderful instrumentation, asking questions that we have all asked ourselves while making it sound good, while at the same time binding all the songs together with a superb cohesive element, and making a steady progression from beginning to end. It's just too good for it to slip by you. Buy this now and you'll never regret it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This album of t.A.T.u. is absolutely amazing, the sound that you find in this production is just cool, you can feel the power of this two russian girls in every lyric of their songs starting with All the Things She Said and also songs like Not Gonna Get Us<br />and Show me Love they're just spectacular.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer has stormed into the music world, armed with nothing but his guitar and his wit. And he has, in the past year, proved his staying power, now backed with a Grammy Award and endless radio airplay of his three singles. In \\"Room for Squares,\\" the Connecticut-born's major debut album, Mayer creates a music style that, although many will compare to Dave Matthews, Jack Johnson, and David Gray, is uniquely his own. <br />After hearing \\"No Such Thing,\\" Mayer's first radio single, a few times, it immediately grew on me. He seemed to go beyond what all other radio-friendly songs touched upon, and actually go in depth, crying out that there's \\"No such thing as the real world/Just a lie that you've got to rise above.\\" I quickly purchased it, only to realize that \\"No Such Thing\\" was not just a fluke single. Not by a long shot.<br />The coolest thing about this album is its uncoolness. It is based on imperfection, centered on inadequacy. And that's what it's supposed to be. Even the CD has a Periodic Table of the Elements on it! (I really liked that feature, sometimes I even use it for that purpose, being a college Chemistry student and all), Mayer's guitar playing is very well advanced, especially for his young age. \\"Neon\\" has some of the razziest guitar I've heard in a long time. But what really creates his songs are the lyrics. The incredibly wry sentences he creates is what makes him an excellent song-writer. On \\"My Stupid Mouth,\\" he delves into the awkwardness of a relationship, resorting to \\"playing a quick chess game with the salt and pepper shaker.\\"  <br />What is so real about John Mayer is that he embraces who he is, inadequacies and all, and he's not afraid to admit it. \\"Why Georgia\\" is definitely one of my favorite songs on the album, but I'm sure you're all familiar with this song by now. I like to point out to people that John Mayer is almost a modern-day Hamlet, questioning the way he lives life during his \\"quarter-life crisis.\\" On \\"Love Song for No One,\\"he feels stressed that he should have found love by now, rambling \\"I could've passed you in the sandbox, I could've passed you on the sidewalk.\\" He finishes the album with the absolutely brilliant \\"St. Patrick's Day,\\" talking of the delay of action in a relationship until it atrophies into nothing. It's not a happy ending at all, more like an inevitability, leaving us wanting more.<br />The only somewhat low point on the album is the way too overplayed \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland,\\" which is good, but it doesn't really seem to fit his style, at least not as much as the rest of the album. But you've all heard that song, so if you absolutely love that, you'll love the album. And with the release of John Mayer's next album, \\"Heavier Things,\\" in September, Mayer's career is going to grow by leaps and bounds to become one of the most celebrated musicians of our generation.<br />Oh, and make sure to see John Mayer live. He's awesome!
0792839749|4.0|Our family is on a retro trip, having bought this movie, as well as The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The King and I, Willy Wonka, and Pete's Dragon.<br />One of the reasons is that we want our 2 year old to experience the movies we grew up with, and the other is nostalgia.<br />Before watching this movie again recently, I could only remember that there was a flying car, a nice title song, and something about children being kidnapped. Watching it again for the first time, I discovered that I had forgotten most of the movie.<br />Caractacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke) is an inventor way ahead of his time, whose inventions don't always work the way they are intended.  If you think his name is weird, the female lead is Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes), the daughter of a rich sweet manufacturer.  This unlikely pair, along with his two kids and the wonderful car, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, are the star players in a story which starts out being about pirates, and ends up as a rescue mission.  With comic support from Caractacus' father, and a toy maker (Benny Hill, in an uncharacteristic G rated performance), they defeat the schemes of spies (kind of like Laurel and Hardy combined with Boris and Natasha), an evil Baron and Baroness,and a wicked childcatcher, to bring the story within a story to a predictable but entertaining end.<br />The scenery is breathtaking, especially the Vulgarian castle and surroundings, and since this is a 1968 movie, we can forgive the lack of finesse in the special effects, where the characters stick out like sore thumbs from the backgrounds, and wires can be seen attached to Professor Potts during a dance sequence.<br />It's a little harder to swallow the concept of Truly Scrumptious running around on the beach dressed in tons of white cloth and coming up spotless, and her song about needing a lovely man is way too over the top and much too long. I will admit to skipping over that one.<br />The sing along feature is a nice touch, and catchy songs (other than the theme song) include \\"Me Old Bamboo\\", \\"Toot Sweet\\", my personal favorite \\"P O S H (Posh)\\", and the nearly too sugary \\"Truly Scrumptious\\".<br />Overall, this DVD is a refreshing family movie that you will watch over and over again.ature is a nice touch, and catchy songs (other than the theme song) include \\"Me Old Bamboo\\", \\"Toot Sweet\\", my personal favorite \\"P O S H (Posh)\\", and the nearly too sugary \\"Truly Scrumptious\\".  <br />Overall, this DVD is a refreshing family movie that you will watch over and over again.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is absolutely fabulous. EVERY track is awesome!! Not 1 bad song! The lead singer, Amy Lee is so talented. Theyre just such a great band and you should definately buy this CD. Its way worth it!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|On Christina's first Cd, you could tell she had a great instrument that needed the right songs and more development.  \\"Stripped\\" shows off what she's learned in the period between and her incredible vocal abilities.  Not one track on here is a filler - probably every one could be a single.  And if you think the girl can't sing, just listen to 30 seconds of \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Soar\\" or \\"The Voice Within\\".  The album included samples hip hop, soul, funk, Latin, pop and something that sounds Hole-ish.  Her ballads are all soleful and you can tell they mean something to her, while the upbeat tracks are carefully mixed, produced and include big names like Redman and Lil Kim, they also have personality and meaning.  Another plus is that practically every song has a positive message: women empowerment, staying true to yourself, overcoming pain and abuse.  My only small problem is that Christina sometimes goes a tad overboard with the vocal gymnastics.  (see \\"Soar\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\" though I love these tracks)
B00000JPYD|5.0|Every song on this album is absolutely outstanding, being one of fewer than ten albums that I could name where every single song is excellent. My personal favorites are Bridge of Sighs, Day of the Eagle, Too Rolling Stoned and Little Bit of Sympathy. Yet somehow this album seems to be overlooked by rock fans and rock radio stations.<br />This version also includes five live tracks, featuring the best songs from the album. These are also excellent.<br />The sound quality on this CD is much improved over older versions.<br />If you are contemplating between this disc and the import that combines Twice Removed From Yesterday/Bridge of Sighs, I would recommend this one instead for the improved sound quality and the live tracks.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|This is the definition of a rock documentary. All to be measured by in both Metric and Imperial. Thankyou Jeff Stein.
B00008OWZC|5.0|First of all, How the West Was Won (HWWW) is an incredible live Led Zeppelin recording, but not without its faults. That said, it's a must have for any Led Zeppelin fan.<br />A comparison with Song Remains the Same (SRS) seems to be the best approach for this review. Both were recorded at more or less the same time (approximately the time of the release of Houses of the Holy), so neither album includes material from Physical Graffiti. Both include a 26 minute Dazed and Confused, plus lengthy versions of Whole Lotta Love and Moby Dick. I prefer the SRS Dazed and Confused and the HWWW Whole Lotta Love. As for Moby Dick, the only thing worse than a 13 minute long Moby Dick (SRS) is a 19 minute long Moby Dick (HWWW). Fortunately, in the CD-age, skipping to the next song is much easier than when listening to record albums.<br />The real gems on this recording are those songs that are not included on SRS, such as Heartbreaker and a number of songs from the \\"new album\\" Houses of the Holy. Perhaps because the material is newer, Led Zep did not alter the original versions as much as they did on the previously mentioned tracks. Over the Hills and Far Away, Dancing Days, The Ocean are all excellent and, when combined with Song Remains the Same, Rain Song and No Quarter from SRS, fans can enjoy live versions of most of the best of Houses of the Holy.<br />For fans of the song Stairway to Heaven (it's not my favorite Zep song), the version included on HWWW is superior to that on SRS.<br />Finally, the sound quality on this CD is excellent.<br />In short, this CD somehow seems to encapsulate the overall experience of a Led Zep concert better than SRS does. Led Zep should have released this recording years ago, but better late than never.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Finally!  A remastered and expanded edition worth getting!  Not only is this one of Yes' finest albums by itself, but this version also contains many extras that are worth the purchase price alone.  <BR>     In other Rhino re-issues, the so-called &quot;expanded&quot; pieces consist mainly of scraps that are not necessarily noteworthy enough to make a difference.  The rehearsal versions issued here, on the other hand, allow the listener to see what what this band was truly capable of when it was celebrating not only commercial, but critical success as well.  Truly a rare time.  <BR>     The &quot;Going for the One&quot; jam with only Steve Howe (guitar), Chris Squire (bass), and Alan White (drums), should have been released by itself 26 years ago.  Truly a masterpiece.  The instrumentals that were handed out as scraps on the &quot;Yesyears&quot; compilation are also here in complete form, as well as working versions of &quot;Parallels&quot;, &quot;Turn of the Century&quot;, and &quot;Awaken&quot;.<BR>     If you have another copy of &quot;Going for the One&quot;, give it to someone who needs a lesson in classic progressive rock and purchase the re-issue for yourself.  It's cheap!
B00005JKN9|3.0|I never thought before this movie, that America was born in such a bloody river ! I knew that terrible dramas, like the civil war, darkened the great history of the USA. However, I'm terrified to observe that some americans themselves, could imagine their &quot;native&quot; ancestors, so chauvinistic and so fond of mincer-carved flesh !<BR>One could reply that I shouldn't be so frightened because in France, shortly before, the favorite game was to behead the opponents ... But I don't claim it was a typical moment or the basis of our history.<BR>I don't understand the goal of Scorsese. Was it to prove that the USA is not a land of heroes but of butchers ? Was it to demonstrate that the democracy is rotten since the beginning ? Or was it for him a kind of enjoyment to flaunt so much violence ...<BR>As usual, the director is well filming and the action is gasping. Daniel Day Lewis is very impressive but obviously this is not enough. The screenplay is poor and no character is emerging as really attractive or even interesting. Except for the delightful smile of Cameron Diaz ...
B0000A02U2|3.0|It's still the great movie I remember - but \\"double secret probation edition\\"?  What's so special??  There are no out-takes (even though it's noted that the first cut had over a hour of extra footage), the \\"mockumentary\\" is simply lame, and who needs another \\"featurette\\" with the usual talking heads saying how great things were and that everyone was a genius?  Putting previews before the menu and inserting an ad in the box add further insult to injury.<br />If you already own this on dvd or video, save your money for the next re-release ... if you don't, just rent it!
6305263248|1.0|I could write on this movie at great length, except I can put it more succinctly--this has been done many times before, by many different people, in many different styles and they are ALL so much better done that you shouldn't bother with this one.  Great cast--makes you wonder what the producer had on them to make them waste their time (and ours) on this.  <BR>  Biggest plot device to keep us in suspense--don't tell us anything about anything!  <BR>  Biggest surprise at the end--none!  <BR>  Least surprise--what was in the case they have all been chasing since the get-go.  Not even the writer could figure out anything that would make sense, so they NEVER come up with anything!!!  <br />Find anything else to watch and go for it--don't bother with this.  Not worth it--even to see DeNiro.
0375713751|1.0|First, no hedge fund manager rolls into work at 9am.  More like 6am.  Second, no hedge fund manager takes zero for a bonus -- a severance check in lieu of a bonus, but not zero.  Third, she goes on vacation for TWO WEEKS?  How?  Fourth, after returning from a two week vacation, she has only 70 emails -- only if she'd cleaned them out every day of vacation and from home the morning before returning to work.  I thoroughly dislike books that can't get the basic attributes of a profession even close to correct.<br />On her role as \\"mother\\", what school allows home-made treats?  These days, it must be commercially prepared and in a sealed container.  Second, the kid's hair got cut, and will grow back, who cares if the nanny went with a different style?  It's not like she got the kid a tattoo!<br />I could go on, but knowing that at the end she trades it all in...how can this book be anything but depressing for those who choose or must work?  She joins in with the brainwashed in believing and perpetuating the myth that mommy and kiddies all at home together is the situation that is best for everyone.
0446677450|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a financial advisor and teacher. This book taught many important and valuable lessons that are not being taught in schools today. I am currently taking a business finance course in high school and it does not come close to teaching me the important principles that are taught it Rich Dad Poor Dad. After reading this book I bought Robert T. Kiyosaki's other books. I know more than anyone my age, and many adults also thanks to this book, and other books he has printed. I advise anyone who is looking to open their eyes on their finances to read this book. If you are unsure if you want to go into business, or if you are unsure if you want to invest, I advise that you read this book. If you have no interest in investing at all I advise that you read this book. If you are already wealthy, I advise that you read this book. I advise everyone, no matter what their financial situation, poor, middle-class, rich, or ultra-rich, to read this book!
B0000714BP|5.0|&quot;Sometimes it just takes a fairy...&quot;   Let's be honest - this movie wasn't going to win any oscars, but...it's still a fabulous movie!  It's funny how most of the movies that are near and dear to my heart were viciously carved to pieces by the critics.  I can watch this movie over and over because it is a feel good movie.  Sure, it's a bit far fetched...calling these &quot;girls&quot; drag queens is not correct, they are transvestites or transgenders.  I guess you can tell the producers of this movie weren't &quot;that way&quot;.  Hehe<br />Bottom line is:  it's a great movie that you can watch over and over.  The storyline is great, humor and wit is great, musical numbers are great, costumes are good and the overall message is awesome.  <br />&quot;I love you Miss Vida Boheme&quot;.  &quot;I've waited a lifetime to hear those words spoken to that name.&quot;  Need I say more?
B00005U8EM|5.0|Sometime in life you think that You are not achieving anything, this movie takes you from your low state of mind into another one full of possibilities and goals.<br />It is a great movie, carefully directed and acted, with a very clever sense of humor.<br />Although you should be carefull with some scenes in which our antihero( that makes a conversion to hero), committes suicide, so parental help is needed to understand situations.<br />These are the kind of movies that are needed to change the sad state of some people without aspiration in a very funny and intelligent movie.<br />The only thing that is misleading is that you should notice the character of the heroine, it is not just a pretty face. She is strong in her convictions, and has a higher level of culture and sensibility that other women on the movie dont have.
0385491026|4.0|This novel interested me because I am both a writer<BR>and a visual artist and of course the book was written by the<BR>former and about the latter...the elements of childhood that have shaped her.  I enjoyed it but...I gave it four stars because its &quot;shadow&quot;-protagonist - a childhood chum of the main protagonist, the artist, remains just that throughout the book - a shadow.  Now, this could be effective under certain circumstances, but Cordelia is so important...she keeps popping up in the artist's consciousness as a particularly important fixture in her early life....but I don't really get a true &quot;sense&quot; of her.  Even when the author meets her later in life under strange and tragic circumstances...and her constant searching for Cordelia in ever stranger and on every corner...the character of this...character....doesn't gel.  So a major conceit of the book was lacking for me, and I grew weary of it.  I wanted to know SOMETHING more substantial about Cordelia, but never felt I really did.  Other characters - childhood friends, the artist's parents and brother...were wonderfully drawn.  Also the mother of a friend...a hateful, religious bigot who becomes the vengeful centerpiece of the artist's work, are deliciously drawn.  But as I said, I feel the writer failed to make the one character who was pivotal come alive.
B00005RDSM|2.0|My wife and I are big Disney fans and purchased this movie with a lot of anticipation.  We were both extremely disappointed.  Almost all of the characters in this film are cruel and unlikeable, including Peter Pan himself.  Tinkerbell is nasty and consumed with jealousy, completely one-dimensional, and Peter is a shallow, self-absorbed imp.  It's hard to imagine anyone--especially sweet Wendy--liking him.  Even minor characters like the mermaids are given a jealous, petty edge.<br />The playful theme that we associate with the Peter Pan tale is almost nowhere to be found in this movie.  I can see by all the positive reviews that my view is in the minority, and that's okay.  I really wanted to like this movie, but couldn't.  I kept hoping that Captain Hook--who had his hand cut off by Peter and fed to a crocodile (!)--could get ahold of bratty Peter and teach him a lesson.

0140185232|5.0|As Maugham puts it, it is a &quot;success story&quot;. The tale of several characters going through life with an idea of what life should be like, and each of them finding it. Wheather respectable or not, the pursuits of the characters are described in a way as not to judge too harshly but obviously enought to convey the point.<BR>An excellent story with something to learn for everybody.
B000056K04|1.0|Glen Ballard should be shot for this piece of garbage. If you are a fan of DMB, you will not like this album. It just doesn't sound like them. What in the world made Glen Ballard think that after millions and millions of albums sold that the band needed a new sound? Go buy &quot;Busted Stuff&quot; if you want something new.
B00005JKZV|3.0|I think any fan of the books or movies will want to have The Two Towers, but they should wait for the extended edition. The \\"specials\\" on this version are simply rehashes of documentaries already released, and to refresh ones memory about the story, I'd recommend renting this at the video store instead.<BR>There is Sean Astin's short as a special feature, but I doubt that'll be omitted from the EV, and even if it is, it's not that big of a deal.<BR>Wait the two more months for the one with more footage.
B000089RVX|1.0|This cd is very very annoying. The singers shrill shrieks almost make my glasses shatter. The group just goes on and on about morbid dumb things. I think Evanescence should go back to playing at Bar Mitzvas.
B00006G8HX|3.0|Star Trek II made such an impact in fans it was probably a good call to make a sequel. It wasn't very good but there is still a lot of Star Trek fun in it. The Klingons have evolved in makeup and language, we say goodbye to the most famous starship of all time and the bridge crew relationships get stronger, but it is generally boring. The visual effects are not that good and the plot is very week. The story gets a lot better when you know what happens in Star Trek IV.<BR>Anyway, it is still Star Trek (unlike Nemesis).
B00008NRI8|4.0|This movie is a lot like Hugh Grant, charming if clumsy.<br />The comedic timing of Hugh Grant is impeccable, as always.  Sandra Bullock also is completely believable as the crunchy-granola lawyer.  The two have great chemistry, and are quite funny together.  There are a couple of pee your pants laugh lines in the first half of the movie.<br />It's the second half that slows down once we introduce the inevitable 'jealousy' of the love triangle. The director is clumsy with editing--the secondary characters are not firmly established enough in our minds to be interesting on their own, though the parents are quite fun.<br />In all, this could have been a huge hit with a more experienced director.  Instead, it's going to amuse, entertain and charm--but it won't stand out in your mind as a classic.
B0000683DH|4.0|This is the movie I've watched the most times in my life. It is the best tribute to the original series althought the first one is a much better movie. We have passed from an extraordinary Star Trek film to a Great Captain Kirk movie. It is great Sci-Fi, wonderful visual effects, superb action scenes, amazing story telling, profound character devellopment and stupendous Star Trek. <BR>To me it is the 3rd best Trek movie of the series.
B00009RGBS|2.0|Chicago was visually beautiful, well performed, and displayed some top-rate editing and directing.  But ultimately, a movie needs to stand on its story.<br />This story is not only cynical, simplistic and unsympathetic--its also flawed. The characters were all very unsympathetic and corrupt--the only two redeemable ones getting shafted or executed. A story doesn't have to be uplifting or happy to be good.  But it does have to be complete. The fact that Roxie's devoted husband just sort of meanders and disappears into the night is a violation of story-telling on the highest order.<br />I'm indifferent to musicals--I'll state that upfront.  And yet, comparing Chicago to Moulan Rouge, I have to say that I'm shocked at the number of awards Chicago won.  Moulan Rouge seemed superior to this movie in every way to the eyes of this layperson.<br />Ultimately, it was a movie I could respect, but not love.
B000083C49|3.0|If you watch Star Trek II you have to know what happened to Spock, and if you watch Star Trek III you have to watch The Voyage Home so you don't stay dissapointed about the Star Trek experience. Star Trek IV feels like a comeback but it is more an entertaining sunday afternoon movie than a Star Trek adventure. It is a satire made by an overthehill cast. Even so, I love it. It has to go in the colection. It is a great tribute to a legendary cast that reminds you not to take Sci-Fi so seriously. It has great topics and a good finale to the trilogy.

B00008US8R|5.0|This is simply an AWESOME CD from Evanescence. Don't listen to ANY of the negative reviews that compare it to Linkin Park. Those people have obviously only heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and maybe &quot;Going Under&quot;. The only reason why &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; does sound how it does, is because the record label wanted it that way or else they wouldn't have signed them. There is actually a version of &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; which has only Amy singing.<br />This CD is simply brilliant. Amy's voice gives me goosebumps whenever I listen to any of their songs. She is extremely talented as is the entire band. There is lots of passion in all their songs, and when you actually listen to the lyrics, you can feel it. You may also want to check out their actual first CD, &quot;Origin&quot;. It was released in limited numbers, as such, it is no longer available, but Evanescence prefers people download the music from that album and buy &quot;Fallen&quot;. I recommend you do so as well. Both are awesome and you shouldn't be disappointed.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I almost never reply to other reviews but this time I had to. The simple reason is that in my opinion [some people] clearly don't have a clue about creating this kind of movie or book adaptations in general. Comparing it with Brideshead re-visited which is as far as I know only excellent as a tv-series is like comparing apples and oranges. Also, reviewing it from a vhs tape...brrrr.<BR>Although I might agree about the way Frodo is portrayed it is also true that Frodo doesn't have much depth in the book either.<BR>And true the short detour that Aragon takes of the cliff is pointles. The arrival of the elves at Helmsdeep, however, serves dramatic purposes in the movie that acutally work quite well. Besides it makes the odds of holding the keep a litle more realistic. Who cares whether this is in the book or not. The keyword here is adaptation! I am not interested in literally filming the book. What's the point?<BR>I think what some Tolkien afficionado's don't realise that as far as the fantasy film genre goes filmhistory is made. There isn't any fantasy movie that even comes close this trilogy. And by the way in his spare time Peter Jackson makes funny litle horror movies like braindead and badtaste...<BR>As far as a review should go I think TTT should get 4 out of 5 stars. This is largely due to the fact that I cannot think of any second part in a trilogy that is satisfying on it's own (unless of course it are relatively seperate stories - like the godfather movies). And if the rumours are true that TROTK combines the best of part one and two it should be excellent!
0385504209|3.0|More than once during the read of this novel, I have winced at the lack of credibility--either at the story line or at one of the interjected historical lessons. To wit (page 125), Brown expects the reader to accept that male domination in political and religious life (including the lack of female Orthodox Jewish rabbis or Islamic clerics) is to be blamed on the European Catholic Church of the Middle Ages. He credits the Malleus Maleficarum for ending the \\"days of the goddess,\\" expecting the reader to suspend recognition that nearly all dominant cultures throughout recorded history have had religions in which male gods dominate over female godesses and political systems in which men hold positions of greatest authority. I'm not sure The Da Vinci Code should be used as a source of credible information so much as a fun and generally clever light-weight mystery thriller.
B000066NW0|5.0|Lots of people think Avril Lavigne is a poser, has no real talent, blah blah blah, but it's not true!! She does write at least the lyrics to her songs, and she does play the guitar live.      Most of the songs have really meaningful or empowering lyrics such as &quot;Is it enough to love/ is it enough to breathe/ somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed/ I'd rather be anything but ordinary please. . .&quot; My personal favorites are Anything But Ordinary, Things I'll Never Say, and My World. Buy this CD! It's worth every penny!
B000002HRE|5.0|In just the last 18 months I have become a HUGE Metallica fan.  One of the reasons is this album.  Reload at times sounds like its predecessor Load, but overall it is a very different album in style and sound.  Both albums are great.  Hetfield's voice on cuts like Fuel, Where the Wild Things Are, and Devil's Dance reaches out and grabs you by the throat.  Hammet's solos and Ulrich's drumming are superb.  This album is very different from the Black Album, but both are great in their own individual way.  The word I think of when I listen to Metallica is VISCERAL...their music reaches in and pulls out your guts! If you like rock music with cognitive style but also a backbone of steel, Reload, Load, and the Black Album are for you.
0385504209|3.0|The good news is that it is a heck of a fun read.  The author's storytelling skills keep the reader in suspense page after page.  And every little detail counts, so it's fun to anticipate and see how it is used later in the book.  Plus, the nuggets of what the Amazon review describes as \\"esoteria\\" should help readers in Trivial Pursuit, Jeopardy, and cocktail parties.<br />The bad news is that, as Langdon and Teabing themselves admit, the conspiracy stuff is old news.  The \\"explosive truth\\" that is guarded as a secret has been alleged for many centuries and has never received popular or academic acceptance, and this is only its latest incarnation and retelling.  The author's \\"genius\\" is in weaving merely 3 or 4 accepted facts (which he lists in the introduction to the book), with pagan and neopagan beliefs, anti-Catholic conspiracy theories, Knights Templar lore and legend, liberal feminist theology, postmodern critiques, and so on.<br />I sure hope nobody (not one person) takes the allegations in this book for gospel truth.  It's a great airplane/airport/vacation read, accompanied with lots of hype.  And nothing more.<br />*review title is in atbash, which is one of the parlor games referred to in the book
B000062YB1|2.0|After Slayer produced Reign in Blood, arguably the best metal album of all time, I guess they could go no further in that direction, and produced South of Heaven, a mediocre album that has some good songs, and some bad songs. I suspect that they tried to be more like Metallica with South of Heaven, in order to get into the mainstream rock culture and sell more albums. Some reviews say South of Heaven was their worst album of that period, but it's significantly better then Seasons in the Abyss. There are only a few decent songs on this album, and the rest sounds very tired and poorly produced. Slayers live album, Decade of Aggression actually brings to life some of the songs on this album, and I recommend getting that CD first and see if you like those songs. The title track is not bad, but unless you have heard it before and really like it, this album isn't worth getting.
B00005NIL9|4.0|Probably Free's best album at the time, &quot;Fire And Water&quot; features the group's biggest hit, &quot;All Right Now&quot;, as well as several other good, well-structured blues-rockers.<br />Having said that, I strongly advise you not to buy it.<BR>That's right. Six of these seven songs are on the superb &quot;Molten Gold - The Free Anthology&quot;, and that one is the only Free CD you'll ever need...it gathers virtually every Free song of note onto two discs.<BR>And besides - this remastered edition (which hasn't yet taken the place of the original seven-track CD in the US, and thus costs a lot more) isn't worth the extra cash...there may be six bonus cuts, but five of them are various alternative renditions of either &quot;All Right Now&quot; or the title song.
B000062YAZ|5.0|It took a few listens to get me to like this album, after listening to Hell Awaits dozens of times. But after several listens, I agree with many that this is the best metal album of all time. The lyrical topics, guitar, drums, pace, speed, everything is nearly perfect. It doesn't sound like 28 minutes of metal, it sounds like a full 75 minute CD---that's how rich the music is. Angel of Death is a classic, and was used in the movie &quot;Jackass&quot;. Others of note are Raining Blood, Jesus Saves, and the most underrated &quot;Epidemic&quot;, which has awesome lyrics: &quot;Waiting to unfold, raging uncontrolled! Adapt a potency, death machine infest my corpse to be!&quot;. And remember, this was written in 1985, before the AIDS epidemic really took off. Prophetic, isn't it.
B000066HI4|5.0|&quot;Joya&quot; and &quot;I See A Darkness&quot; are utter masterpieces. If you like one then buy the other immediately. The rest of the Oldham oeuvre is worth having too, but these two are the pinnacle.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The epic battle of good versus evil continues with the thrilling film spectacle \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\". With the Fellowship broken, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest into Mordor and form an uneasy alliance with the creature Gollum. As Sauron's power continues to grow, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) aid the people of Rohan against Saruman's (Christopher Lee) massive army. \\"The Two Towers\\" is an outstanding continuation of Peter Jackson's award-winning adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's epic fantasy. The film contains an incredibly engaging storyline with such memorable scenes and interesting characters. The cast is wonderful with Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Ian McKellen delivering some powerful performances. The creature Gollum is a stunning visual accomplishment and Andy Serkis's voice work is remarkable. The movie also features some amazing special effects and edge-of-your-seat action sequences including the climactic battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />If you're unable to wait for the 4-Disc Extended Edition in November, then \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" 2-Disc Edition is certainly a fine addition to any DVD collection. The sensational blockbuster is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 widescreen format. The DVD contains a flawless video transfer with rich color detail. Its Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound is stunning and very aggressive. It might not be the Extended Edition but this 2-Disc edition features numerous behind-the-scenes featurettes, preview of the upcoming \\"The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King\\", trailers, TV spots, web featurettes and a music video. Overall, \\"The Two Towers\\" is a fantastic DVD and definitely scores an \\"A\\".
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have listened to this CD non-stop since I bought it, and it never gets old. Gavin's voice is so unique (both literally and figuratively). It can be soothing (as in the ballads on the album) yet he can also totally ROCK. I have been telling everyone to BUY this album! You will not be disappointed!!!
0385512104|5.0|What a debut novel this is! Brilliantly written in the voice of an autistic 15 year old, it's always believable and never over the top. What starts off as a detective story becomes a chronicle of the daily life of Christopher, and an amazing journey into the mind and world of a 'Special Needs' young man. The book is peppered with puzzles, diagrams, maps, and some 'jokes' made by the 'normal' people that Christopher needs to decode and never fully understands. <br />If you thought 'Rain Man' was cool...read this book. A truly marvelous read, and one of the freshest, more original literary works I've read from a contemporary writer.<br />Note: If you haven't read 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' by Arthur Conan Doyle, and plan to, read that book first. This book gives away the plot and the ending.
1559408758|5.0|When first delving into the world of heavy metal, my friend Matt (a.k.a. tkdmateo) informed me of this film, a funny &quot;rockumentary&quot; about a fictitious group called Spinal Tap.  The key members in this were guitarist/vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), guitarist/vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), keyboardist Tommy Pischedda (Bruno Kirby), and a slew of over 30 drummers in the course of their career.<br />This is one of those films where it's hilarious and sadly true simultaneously.  Stuff like this actually happens in the music industry; it may be overexaggerated, but it's all too true.  The drummers that keep &quot;spontaneously combusting&quot; or &quot;choking on vomit&quot; (or whatever else initiated their demise) is a homage and a parody of the legendary metal band Judas Priest, who kept switching drummers album after album (until 1980's British Steel).  Rob Reiner, acclaimed director of &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and &quot;A Few Good Men,&quot; also co-wrote the script (or improvisations, as most of the film was) with Shearer, Guest, and McKean, and he also &quot;hosts&quot; the film as Marty DiBergi.  He keeps the film satirical and hilarious, while also keeping the characters straight-forward and serious without making it campy.<br />The music is performed by all the actors, believe it or not, and the songs are often well-constructed and catchy, while also sporting some hilarious lyrics.  Songs including &quot;Big Bottom&quot; and &quot;Hell Hole&quot; are both praising and mocking rock, and some other songs like &quot;The Flower People&quot; exploit the time periods in which rock existed in a different mindset.<br />It's all played very well, and it features a few actors that come in as surprising cameos including Ed Begley, Jr., Patrick Macnee, Howard Hessman, and Billy Crystal (who happens to be a good friend of Mr. Reiner), among many others.  A revolutionary film, both for those who love rock n' roll and of improvisational comedy.  Even if you don't like it (for whatever reason, you are wrong), it's still a movie that MUST be seen because it is indeed a cinematic marvel.  Besides, how can you NOT laugh at hilarious scenes like the amplifier that goes to 11, or the album being rechanged to become the &quot;black album,&quot; in which no photos or text at all (perhaps Metallica was influenced by this film?)?  This scene was in fact influenced by the Beatles' &quot;White Album.&quot;  In addition to these scenes you get the manager's &quot;punishment paddle&quot; (or whatever it's called) and the debacle regarding the song &quot;Stonehenge.&quot;  Extremely funny scenes!<br />As for the DVD release, it contains sweet features like the theatrical trailer, interviews, and TONS of deleted scenes that are almost as long as the film itself!  This, my friends, is a classic masterpiece that fits in perfectly, whatever your collection is.n' roll and of improvisational comedy.

078322933X|3.0|Although this isn't a horror movie, it's fairly scary just because it can be so real at times.  For anyone who has been through verbal or physical violence in a relationship, this movie might be a bit much to handle.<br />Nicole (Reese Witherspoon)is a 16 year old girl who, like most teenage girls, likes to have fun. When she and her best friend Margo go out to a party one night, Nicole meets the handsome and mysterious David (Mark Wahlberg).  Soon, she starts spending a lot of time with David.  However, after a couple of weeks, Nicole realizes that David is becoming extremely possessive and jealous whenever.  David even goes to the extreme by beating up one of Nicole's male friends because he's seen walking Nicole home. When Nicole ends the relationship with David, he tries everything to try and get her back but when that doesn't work, he begins to take things too far.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's work is always of a very high standard and worth looking out for.  I have seen both the 2 hour version and the 4 hour version of Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.  I had thought the 2 hour version was superb, but the 4 hour version is (believe it or not) even better!<br />If you like Shakespeare, you'll love this!
B00005RHGK|3.0|The trailers for this movie made it seem so scary, but trailers are usually misleading.  Although it did have its scary and whiteknuckle scenes, overall it wasn't a great movie.  Siblings Darryl (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Phillips) are on their way home from their freshmen year at college.  Their trip home begins to turn dangerous when they see a man in a trench coat and a hat that covers his face dumping something down a pipe. They recognize him as the man who tried to run them off the road earlier.  Like going into a basement in a horror movie, Darryl decides to see for himself what was dumped down the pipe.<br />Soon they realize they're being chased by an ancient demon known as the Creeper.
0446604844|4.0|David Baldacci's &quot;Total Control&quot; kept me riveted throughout with it's roller-coaster plot and exciting characters.  I hadn't read one of his thrillers before this, but liked &quot;Wish You Well&quot; so much that I wanted to delve into his previous works.  I wasn't disappointed.  Although in need of some continuity editing, &quot;Total Control&quot; was strong enough a story to hold my attention and make me want more.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The first time I saw Donnie Darko, my jaw was hanging on the floor as the credits began to roll.  I was literally staring at my TV, dumbfounded at the spectacle I had just witnessed.  The only other movies I've seen that have produced a similar effect were \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" and, to a lesser extent, \\"Mulholland Drive.\\"  If you liked those two movies, you'll like \\"Donnie Darko,\\" especially if you found \\"Requiem\\" too depressing and \\"Mulholland\\" too jumbled.  Granted, it's a downer, and it's convoluted, but not as much as the other two, thus sort of being an in between of those two movies.  First time writer and director (and hopefully not last time) Richard Kelly has created an unclassifiable movie, that truly defies description.  However, since I want to be an informative reviewer, I'll do my best.<br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" is about many things.  On the grand scale, it's about choice, God, and inevitability.  On a smaller scale, it's about time paradoxes, disturbed minds, and coming of age (sort of).  I prefer to look at the movie on the former, but the well acted characters force me to treat the movie more personally, and involve the emotions as well as the intellect.<br />As far as direct plot is concerned, I'll simply give the set up, because there's no one thing that the movie is \\"about.\\"  Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is about 17 or 18, in high school in the 80's, and mentally disturbed.  He's a morbid person, but perceptive, and both smart and wise.  He is awakened one night by a voice that calls him away from his bed and outside.  There he meets Frank, who is a guy in a demonic rabbit costume.  I suppose you could look at the film as what would happen if David Lynch directed \\"Harvey.\\"  Anyway, Frank informs Donnie that the world will end in 28 days (later, hehe), 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.  Donnie wakes up on a golf course.  Meanwhile, during the night, a jet engine (that's right, a jet engine) from a plane crashes through the roof of Donnie's room.The tricky part is that the rest of the plane is nowhere to be found, and no flights were scheduled for such a flight path that day.  Donnie now feels indebted to Frank for calling him out of bed, and thus saving his life.  So begins the story.  I can't tell anymore, because a) it's just too complicated, and b) I don't want to spoil it.<br />The writing is incredible.  Aside from the scattered main plot (which is drawn together beautifully), there are some excellent conversations and pieces of dialogue, my favorite being the discussion on the sexual habits of Smurfs.  It's scenes like that that keep the movie with a lighter side.  The backdrop of the 80's (1988, namely), which is very well done, provides an excellent setting, and provides an excellent soundtrack, which consists of original music and 80's tunes, with music by \\"Tears for Fears\\" being the standout.  The slow, mellancholly, cover of \\"Mad World\\" at the end is devastating, and fits the moment so perfectly it's almost as if the song were created specifically for this movie.<br />The acting is top notch.  Jake Gyllenhaal proves himself a fantastic actor at last, after skirting with glory in other movies, like \\"October Sky.\\"  This is the movie he needed to recover from \\"Bubble Boy.\\"  The supporting cast does their job, even with admittedly trivial characters, like his english teacher (Drew Barrymore).  His girlfriend (I don't know the actress) is a perfect match for him, and their relationship is heartbreaking in its content and in its context.  In other words, the perfect match of sad people is that much more sad.  Patrick Swayze is delicious in his role as a popular, but obviously phony, motivational speaker and writer.  Mrs. Farmer (again, I forget the name, but she's the lady who fell under the bus in \\"Speed\\") is an excellent uptight teacher, and gets one of my favorite lines: \\"Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion!\\"  <br />This paragraph will have a few spoilers, so read on to the conclusion if you haven't seen it yet.  The most recent time I viewed the movie (again), I picked up on the religious dimension of the film.  I noticed the placement of \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" each time before, but this time I actually took note of Donnie's religious parallel.  I understood in the moment right before the credits roll when Gretchen and Mrs. Darko have the strange connection that insinuates that they somehow \\"know\\" each other.  I picked up on that a little bit the first few times as a connection transending space-time from the universe in which Donnie wasn't killed...Anyway, the last time I realized what the real connection was: without Donnie's sacrifice, they'd both be dead.  For Donnie so loved the world that he gave himself to save Gretchen, his mother, his sister, Frank, and all the others on the plane...  This movie is smart, emotionally powerful, and unbelievably original.  Go see it.  Now.
B00005JLEU|1.0|I wanted to give this movie 100000 stars but I know that many people only read the bad reviews (myself Included) I had to give it one star just so you might read this film review... The reason most people dislik the film is that they are too Americanized (or Westernized). There are so many aspects of Japanese culture in the film that many &quot;outsiders&quot; just don't understand. To say that the story line is bizarre is just like saying I don't get Don Quixote. But you'd never bad-mouth Don Quixote. Maybe you should get off your high horse and take a Japanese Culture class and watch the movie again. It is a magical Movie. I have not been this enthrawled in years. Its not my favorite movie (Spirited Away is my 8th favorite) But its worth every penny and worth the praise it got. If you don't understand a movie then don't condemm it. And lastly, in responce to the comments about this movie being too scary for children, my cousins (6 and 10 girls and 5 and 8 Boys) all loved this film and were not scared. They loved the raddish God (so did I) and they thought that the story was very good. (they understood most but not all of it) This film takes me too a place I yearn to go and brings be home with the joy and hopefullness that are lacking in todays world... thank you Miyzazki

B0000214F0|5.0|Having been an ancient history buff for over 40 years, I've finally come across a film that attempts to dipict the reality of life in countries like ancient Rome. Anyone reading virtually any of the histories of the ancient world must come away wondering why authors continually sanitize the facts of life in that age. <BR>It seems that only the ancient historians had the integrity to tell the truth and to attempt to characterize life in those times. Seutonius is one who immediately comes to mind. <br />The film does not attempt to reconstruct all of what it was like to live among the upper classes in Rome but it does attempt to make up for the sanitization of history which we are forced to accept from current historians.<BR>For that reason, I believe this is a must see film.

B000002U82|5.0|If you don't have this disc, go buy it as soon as you're finished reading this review.  Dark Side is one of the few, true blue, certified, bonafide, must-have classic rock albums.  And no, Virginia, you don't have to watch it in sync with the Wizard of Oz to appreciate it.<br />The concept album was no longer a new thing when Floyd released Dark Side, but there weren't that many concept albums out that \\"did it right\\".  Sure, there was Sgt. Peppers, We're Only In It For The Money, Tommy and a few others, but I personally believe that Dark Side eclipsed them all.  (Sorry, couldn't resist...)  Suffice to say that one doesn't have to listen to Dark Side too many times to fully appreciate how seamlessly the songs flow together.  I don't think of it as a collection of songs or even just an album - it's a monumental musical statement.<br />Much is made of the sound quality of the album and how it is demonstration material.  I agree with that assessment and used to lug a pristine copy of the British EMI vinyl around to audio stores when considering an upgrade.  But if you want the best-sounding CD copy of Dark Side, you'll need to hunt down a copy of the Mobile Fidelity mastering.  It is rumored to have used the same master tape as that used for the British vinyl.  In fact, it's a hoot to think about this being an audiophile demo disc, beacuse, according to David Gilmore's interview on the \\"In The Studio\\" radio show, the engineers made a critical mistake when recording the album.  Apparently, the studio had installed a new Dolby compression unit right before recording these tracks and it wasn't discovered until the mastering phase that the Dolby unit had not been switched into the recording loop.  So the engineers had to take the multitrack master, run it through the compressor, onto another multi-track tape machine, then do the mix-down.  But it's hard to argue with the final result - excellent frequency response, huge, deep sound stage and wide dynamic range.  But don't forget that great recordings just make it possible for us to hear through to the music, warts and all.  Lousy music still sounds lousy when it's recorded well but great music is truly incredible and that, in spades, is what Dark Side is.orget that great recordings just make it possible for us to hear through to the music, warts and all.

B000099T2L|5.0|Simply damn good music.<br />Beyonce is a surprisingly good talent.<br />I listened to this to CD in a 10 hour drive.  I then proceeded to listen to it on the drive back; it is that good.
B00009MGQL|3.0|Yes, more of the same.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, because Beck's had a string of strong albums.  But he's certainly plumbing on down the same line as his last disc, with industrial backdrops to yet another set of excellent solos.  He certainly hasn't lost his touch for writing tasty chops.  I just wonder where Beck might have gone had he hung out with musicians that challenged him more.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|Brilliant. Josh Rouse continues to amaze.
B00009TB5G|3.0|I've read a lot of reviews from \\"pursist\\" who have completely trashed this movie for not following the book exactly and also newbie's who seem to think that the movie is flawless and don't seem to mind that Peter Jackson needlessly butchered much of Tolkein's good work. I would like to inform you that you are both wrong. The LOTR books would not make good films as they are, there are simply far too rich, they need to be abridged and simplified. However, Jackson did an absolutely rotten job of this. He needlessly added pointless action scenes such as those terribly animated \\"warg\\" riders (wargs are giant, intelligent, and malicous wolves, Pete) and the much hated Aragorn falling of the cliff and then wasting 30 minutes flashing back to liv tyler scenes. While simultaneously leaving out very important details such as Gandalf's journey to Isengard, where he shows Saruman what's what, obtains the palantir, and many other meetings and plot points. These details could have fit into a 3 hour movie if Jackson wouldn't have tried to \\"improve\\" on Tolkein by adding made up scenes. The Two Towers did do an amazing job on some things, such as Smeagol and Helm's Deep (so the evles weren't there in the book, get over it, i for one wanted a chance to seem some evles kick some ass and it did fit somewhat with themes present in the history of Middle Earth, which i think is what Jackson was getting at). So all in all I think the movie is a firm okay. Not really good, but not completely awful. It does make me sad though because it did seem to me that Jackson was a lot more faithful to the LOTR story in Fellowship and made it shorter by simply leaving things out (Tom Bombadil for example), but did not resort to adding a lot of new material the way he did in TT. Oh well, perhaps he is going the way of George Lucas, the success of the first movie must have deluded him to the point where he thought he could do a better job that Tokein. I guess Peter doesn't really understand the whole theme of LOTR which is sad. Power corrupts. Even if you desire power to do good you will do evil. In this case if you desire the power to change Tolkein to make a good movie you will make a bad one. Ironic isn't it.
B000001EGA|5.0|It took me years to realize that this is a concept album about Sir Elton John and Bernie Taupin's days before and after becoming songwriting partners.  On a trivial note, this album went platinum the day of its release and I remember my sister getting a copy as a graduation present (the cover was quite unique and impressive with 2 booklets, one featuring the lyrics with photos of young Elton and Bernie in the late 1960's and the other featuring more photos, chart history, the history of Elton John and his band in cartoon form and early pictures of guitarist Davey Johnstone, bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsonn).  The opening track sports a C&W feel with some fine acoustic picking from Davey Johnstone.  Elton, of course, is Captain Fantastic, \\"hardly a hero, just someone his mother might know.\\"  Bernie, of course, is the Brown Dirt Cowboy, \\"still green and growing.\\"  2 rockers \\"Bitter Fingers\\" and \\"Meal Ticket\\" deal with the struggles of survival and Elton and Bernie trying to make it as songwriters.  \\"Better Off Dead\\" almost sounds dispairing in its lyrics, while \\"Tower of Babel\\" speaks of the struggles using religious wordplay.  Bernie still yearns for his native countryside in the \\"Tell Me When the Whistle Blows\\" (featuring a R&B style string arrangement by Gene Page).  On \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight,\\" Elton nearly commits suicide over a lover who demands he give up his musical aspirations for her (had he consented, he'd be the late Reginald Dwight who once wrote music for Bernie Taupin's poems).  The folky \\"Writing\\" sports some fine harmonies and Latino jazz, followed by the melancholy \\"We All Fall in Love Sometimes.\\"  \\"Curtains\\" is the moody finale, with references from some of Bernie's original poems.  Added to this CD form are the 1975 hit \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" (not on the original LP) and 2 John Lennon songs \\"Lucy in the Sky..\\" and \\"One Day at a Time.\\"  Both of the latter feature the late John Lennon who Elton would become friends with.  This is one of the last times the vintage Elton John Band of Davey, Dee and Nigel would be together.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Maybe you would have to already love Neil and Crazy Horse to enjoy this, I am not sure.  But as a long standing fan I think it is extraordinary.  Neil is not a great lyricist but his directness and honesty wins through.  Just buy and listen to it three or four times before you make up your mind.
B00003CXA6|4.0|This is a good long movie that doesn't feel long.  I enjoyed it totally.  Jeff Daniels finally had a character that I liked his as.  I think he deserved an Oscar for this role.  Unlike Gods and Generals, which is a long movie that feels longer, this was quite entertaining.
0316096199|5.0|I am not sure how one who has not been raped would feel about this book, but as a survivor I found comfort and continued healing in this account of such this brutal crime.  Well written.  Very honest.
B00007AJF9|5.0|When Queen Bloody Mary dies from what is found out to be a tumor, her half-sister, thought to be a heritic by her loyalists, takes the throne, causing much controversy to abound throughout the entire kingdom.  Throughout her reign as queen, she faces assassination attempts, newfound and lost love and political turmoil.  Through it all, the movie demonstrates her continuous power and how she deals with each hardship.<br />First of all, this movie is one of the most beautiful I've seen, but in a dark form.  It sort of mesmerizes you, in that it is so different from what it is now.  Second of all, the movie wonderfully captures what the challanges of being a ruler were back then.  For instance, Elizabeth constantly had to face people secretly plotting against her and her subjects plotting against her enemies...without her knowledge.  It truly is a wonderful display of the British Empire as a whole.<br />The acting in this movie was also spectacular.  Cate Blanchett shines in this powerhouse film.  She triumphantly takes in and conveys every emotion and feeling with such grace that it amazes you.  I felt that her competetor at the 1998 Oscars, Gwyneth Paltrow, did not have as difficult a role as Blanchett, thus making Blanchett the better choice for the award.  Unfortunately, the Acadamy did not believe this to be true.  I do think that if anybody were to see this film in full theater format compared to Shakespeare In Love, they would realize how much depth Blanchett as Elizabeth has.  I was blown away.<br />Bottom Line:  Everyone should see this movie for its incredible acting, history, depth, cinematography, beauty, music and the costumes that helped make this film perfect. (I give it an A+ and five out of five stars.  It is number 6 on my top ten favorite movies list.)
B000002NC4|5.0|I live in boise idaho.  I don't know the extensive history of built to spill.  I don't know where the band is even truely located anymore (boise or seattle?)  But i know early today i sat next to Doug Martsh while he was eating a veggie bento with his wife at a great local-boise lunch-stop called Zen Bento's.  He embodies everything that a rock-star should NOT be.  Which is perhaps one of the reasons that i love BUilt to spill so much.  Perhaps he's not really a rockstar, but he certainly should be.  (what i find really humorous is that in idaho Doug is relativly unknown, in the rest of the NW, doug is one of the GOd's of indy rock. this album: Classic.  THis album is by far the best BTS has ever put out.  Kick it in the sun is one of the best songs ever written...ever...(and though you may doubt it; if you listen to, when the second half begins you'll lose all doubt.)  There are so many classic's and so many old bands that you could relate BTS's sound to, but if you think of music as it really is: there are only 12 freakin notes, only 12, and to make an album of such perfection, of course it draws on musical precedents, but music EVOLVES, it isn't always originate.  Life would be so much duller without this album playing while i drink lots of beer and write it a review.  BTS is increadibly inventive considering musical history.  They draw on many sounds; from the Flamming Lips (also awesome) to pink floyd.  But they have such a passion for what they are creating, that in the midst of their exploration of musical energy, they achieve sublimity.  I personally think that Doug Martsh and Tori Amos alone deserve the kind of credit now as the beatles deserved in the 60's.
B0000085N4|3.0|I remember being quite impressed by this album at the time of its release; since then  I can't help but feel that it was a good band's last hurrah.<br />The chops are there; hellacious production by Bob Rock (possibly his best ever), great riffs by Billy Duffy, and Astbury's delivery is never found wanting (check out &quot;Fire Woman&quot;,&quot;Sun King&quot;, &quot;New York City&quot;, and the Kashmir-eque &quot;Soul Asylum&quot;), but at other times, the lyrics and performance are the worst kind of self-parody since every single hair-band in the eighties got their day.<br />Much better than the follow-up &quot;Ceremony&quot;, but the last decent gasp from a derivative band with heart.
B00004TR2G|5.0|I would like to respond to unclesparky's review. You seem to be confused as to the content of the 2000 release of the Jaws soundtrack. It is this recording that contains the original scores tapes as heard in the movie, not the original album release, which was a rerecording of some of the cues as &quot;concert&quot; arrangements. You seem to have it backwards. <BR>Now, as for my opinion, I personally detest rerecordings and always want to hear music as it is heard in the film. This album does a magnificent job of restoring the original master tapes. The cues are short, however, so if you don't like short cues, you might want the original CD. Either way, you can't go wrong, but purists should buy this album, while people who are on the fence should probably go for the older album. Great score either way, well deserving of the Academy Award.
B00008438V|4.0|At last, at last!!!  Why did it take so long to reissue this gem?!!  Just bursting with great lines all the way through, this is a first rate comedy from John Hughes...and Kelly Le Brock in the role she was born to play.

B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley's rendition of the song Hallelujiah is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard and can bring tears to my eyes. I first heard the song sung by Rufus Wainwright and started looking for it.  While Leonard Cohen (who wrote it) is obviously an extraordinarily talented songwriter, Buckley's is the voice that delivers something remarkable. While Hallelujiah is worth the price of the CD to me, there are some other lovely recordings on it as well.  Buckley has an incredible voice and emotional draw. I plan to share this CD with my special friends this Christmas.
0452282152|5.0|Have you ever been in love?  Ever had a silly grin on your face when no one else is laughing?  Has your foot ever tapped to its own accord from simple joy?  I paint this picture of myself as I sat in a train station and started this novel.  I was consumed with the passion and multiple layers of the work as an artist is impassioned at the easel.  Chevalier uses a palette of words like Vemeer used hues to cast images and make breath catch in awe of creativity.  She is a new master of the literary brushstroke, evoking mental pictures and emotions, showing rather than telling me the story and setting.  I rarely read a book more than once, but the plot and the prose are both worthy of greater inspection. You won't put this one down.
B00005JLPK|4.0|I was not familiar with the story of Frida Kahlo and did not know anything about her or her husband Diego Rivera. After watching this colorful, passionate movie, I am sure I will not forget their story. <BR>My first impression from the movie is colors - Frida's face, her red lipstick, her hair with the cloth woven through her braids, the strong colors of her dresses, the flowers she likes and off course the colors Frida uses in her paintings.   <BR>The colors are the rich strong colors of the Mexican culture, the houses, the greenery, and the women dresses. <BR>My second impression is the expressiveness and beauty of Selma Hayak. This actress, whom I never appreciated before, does the role of her life in this movie.  Some reviewers have commented that maybe Selma Hayak is too pretty for this role and their is a lot of truth in this comment but although Selma Hayak is no doubt beautiful she is still able to portray Frida as a very strong natured person with a unique personality, which is, so I feel, the essence and purpose of this movie. <BR>I can appreciate what the critical reviewers wrote about some shallowness and the fact that the story is presented in a Hollywood manner. However, I think that all this is acceptable in order to bring us the interesting story of Frida which did come across. We see her background, and are given means to understand the pain and feelings that are shown in her paintings. I felt that some of the stories in the movie were not totally clear to me - as a viewer I did not feel I totally understood the reasons for Rivera and thus Frida's attraction to the Marxist movement. Another unclear example would be Frida's tolerance to the fact her husbands ex wife and kids live above them. However, even these misunderstandings helps to create her image as an \\"artist\\" in my eyes. <BR>Bottom line: an interesting entertaining movie.
B00005B4GU|4.0|The album gets four stars just for this song. It's one of the best songs I've ever heard. It's truly amazing.

I think another person who posted about this book went to my school because my teacher's name was Coop too. I think all French students should read this book a few times because it really is quite good.
1559277254|5.0|I'm a great mystery lover and a tremendous fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series.  Many books are better when read because you pick up the intellectual nuances that sometimes get lost in recorded books.  Not this one.  Stephanie and all her comrades in craziness are far better when appreciated in audio performance mode.  The lingo, the dialect, the overall hilarity shine through.  Having both read and listened to the books in this series, I can say that the audio versions are far and away the best way to enjoy these characters and their antics.  I can't wait for the movie!

B00005JLSE|5.0|Let me take a moment to comment on the review written by Daniel Wahl below. This movie, as you claim, should be about heroes raising champagne glasses in triumph over evil. However, this is not that kind of movie. This movie is about Chicago in the 20's and 30's...and lives full of crime and hardship. I myself am a professional classical musician and believe these songs are (for one) SUNG better than the airy, whiney attempts of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge. The songs are better orchestrated and capture the feelings of the time when women were finding their sexuality and freedom and hot jazz was ruling the nightclubs. Yes, Moulin Rouge was dazzling, but that's the kind of movie it was. That's Baz Luhrman. This is totally different. Chicago was not a glitzy, \\"raise your champagne glass\\" city and neither is this movie. It's about the desparation of the citizens of Chicago and the pain they felt from the media, politicians, and judicial system. It was a tough time and if you want to see a glimpse of this in an enjoyable movie that is well acted, well sung and well directed, then watch this movie. And if you hate it, at least it will give you something to talk about and THINK about like it did for this reviewer below. Thanks for reading.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Seriously though... &quot;Casablanca&quot; is virtually critic-proof: so stirring and entertaining that even its myriad implausibilities (you'll never see a swankier set of war refugees in your life) add somehow to its charm.  I've seen the film dozens of times - mostly on rainy nights with a glass of Chablis trembling in one hand - and I've never stopped marveling at how Curtiz and his team transcended all the hide-bound elements of the studio system without even trying.  If they had been trying - like in &quot;Passage to Marseilles&quot; - the film would've been a disaster.<br />The special sublimity of the film comes from, I think, the fact that it shouldn't work, really - based on a second-rate (and never produced) play, the movie combines broad comic farce mixed with romantic melodrama stirred up with wartime jinogism.  Yet the screenplay and efficient direction distills out the limitations of each of these elements -the comedy never becomes silly or strained, the romance never weepy, and the sloganeering never obnoxious - and produces an happy and effervescent concotion.<br />Enough about the film - what about this new DVD release? Well, the outtakes aren't especially relevatory (two cut scenes - both inconsequental; a couple of extended shots); the second disk extra are ok (two Bacall documentaries - one on Casablanca which was on the previous disk, another older feature outlining Bogart's film career); and, in descending order of interest, the 1943 Lux Radio program, a mediocre Bugs Bunny take-off, and a thoroughly soporific mid-1950's attempt to make it into a t.v. show (although Marcel Dalio shows a bit of panache in the Renauld role).<br />If you don't already own the film on DVD, get this version. The transfer is excellent and the commentaries are better than average (plus you get a soundtrack extra featuring Dooley Wilson doing several takes of the songs).  After watching the film and all the assorted supplements, you'll get a strong sense of why &quot;Casablanca&quot; was so unique - and why neither Curtiz nor anyone else ever managed to pull off such a coup de theatre again.ot;Casablanca&quot; was so unique - and why neither Curtiz nor anyone else ever managed to pull off such a coup de theatre again.
B00009XITP|5.0|Last night my teen-age daughter invited me to join her in watching \\"What A Girl Wants\\".  This time I decided to leave the work and watch with her.<br /><br />This film is a charming, modern day fairy tale in which Amanda Bynes plays the role of Daphne, an American teenager whose annual birthday wish is to meet her British nobleman father.  Finally deciding that she will have to find him, Amanda sets out to fulfill her dreams.  Her successful search lands her right in the middle of upper class British society, an impending marriage and a high-stakes political campaign.  From then on Amanda and her father, Lord Dashwood, played by Colin Firth, try to adjust to their new relationship, discern their priorities and, in the process, find their true selves.<br /><br />This light, delightful, film enabled my daughter and I to share 105 fun-filled minutes.  Come to think of it, isn't that What A Girl Wants?
B00003CXI1|5.0|HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is nothing but pure magic!  We are as amazed as Harry is as we are introduced to the wizard world like never before with eye-popping special effects, a story that NEVER becomes the least bit boring, and a GREAT adaptation of a marvelous novel!  It's also got some of the best child actors I've ever seen!  So, yeah, it may be long, bit it's so good you just don't want it to end!!!  I remember when I saw it in the theater and when it was over, I said to my girlfriend, &quot;That was so short!&quot;  So, if you want a taste of nothing but magic, suspense, great acting and a great story, DEFINATELY SEE THIS!
B00005U11Z|5.0|I think that anyone who wants to critize the differences between Steve Augeri and Steve Perry should first know more about the differences between Steve Perry and..well...Steve Perry.  By this I mean the changes that his voice went through over the years.  <br />The albums Infinity through Escape were his high note clarity years, and between Frontiers and Trial By Fire were his rugged, not-as-high-because-I'm-losing-my-voice-from-the-Infinity through Escape years.  If you listen to Escape, then Frontiers, or the Journey Live album, which had recordings from concerts after the release of Frontiers (1983), Steve Perry sounded different on his pre-Frontiers songs.  Thats because his voice was changing.  It was totally different on Be Good To Yourself, but still you could tell it was Steve Perry.  <br />Due to this rate decline, I seriously doubt that if Steve Perry were still with Journey today, he would sound the same as we all remember him 20 years ago.  Now, back to Steve Augeri.  Steve Augeri doesn't sound like Steve Perry does right now...but he sounds precisely like Steve Perry did in 1981 and 83.  So, if you go to a concert right now with Steve Augeri, you're actually getting a better deal, most likely, than if you saw Steve Perry.  (But I would go see Perry in a heartbeat just to see the classic line-up).  Augeri just sounds more like classic Journey that Perry probably does right now.<br />A few words about Deen Castronovo.  I think he's a great show drummer...I keep wondering how many more notes he can put in his fills.  If you like to see hot, crazy drum rips, he's great.  I think Steve Smith was a little more musical though.<br />Anyway, this Journey DVD kicks ...  Go buy the album Arrival.  My personal favorites on the album are Higher Place, World Gone Wild, and To Be Alive Again.  As a whole, its better than Trial By Fire.  I'm a devout fan of Journey's signature sound, with Augeri or Perry.

0385504209|5.0|Not being much for thrillers, I was hesitant to start reading this book.  After the first few chapters, I was riveted and couldn't put it down!<br />The premise of the plot is the search for the murderer of the curator of the Louvre who was found under extremely suspicious conditions.  It takes off from there into a story filled with riddles, ciphers, and twists in the search for the Holy Grail.  While most people think of the Grail as the cup from which Jesus drank at the last supper (as did I), in this tale, the supposition is quite surprising.  You will learn much about gnosticism, Leonardo DaVinci's works, and goddess worship while you're trying to decipher the clues that lead to the murderer.  More than anything, the story of the Knights Templar, the Opus Dei (both religious organizations), and the search for the lost goddess kept me turning the pages.<br />I can't recommend this captivating novel enough.  After thinking that it would be nothing special, it's now among my top 10 favorite books - and I read a lot!
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I recently purchased this CD and I must say that this is a great<BR>purchase! Being a long time fan since the Picture Book days, \\"Home\\"is a refreshing listen. Mick Hucknall's vocals and musical arrangements do not disappoint. Long time fans will definitely enjoy this one! The title track reminds me of something in the like of Carol King/Jimmy Webb with it's melancholy feel.\\"Fake\\" had a nice sunny 60's soul groove feel to it with it's slight use of the \\"Baby I Need Your Loving\\" hook in between. They were also clever in emulating some of the Philladelphia soulsters such as the Stylistics and Hall and Oates. For some reason, the sampling of \\"I Can't Go For That\\" seems to work well for \\"Sunrise.\\" Not being a big fan of cover versions (even though this band has done it's fare share of them), I was completely blown away with their version of \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New.\\" Mick seems to hit the mark on this track! \\"Home Loan Blues\\" is a great socially soulful song since \\"Money's Too Tight To Mention.\\"\\"Positively 4th <BR>Street\\" is a great self-comeback song with a nice and strong horn arrangement. In \\"Lost Weekend\\" the band takes on a nice big city Heatwave groove feel, perfect for that sunny drive in San Francisco!\\"Money In My Pocket\\" is a nice ambient dance music piece. \\"Something for You\\" is a nice number that has that great 70's latin-soul vibe with it's jazzy improvisational instrumentation. After all that, we return to that pleasant melancholy sound in \\"It's You.\\" Overall, this is a wonderfully thematic CD, perfect for listening anywhere or anytime. Simply Red is one of the few significant bands that have long continued to produce and perform wonderful music with an amazing freshness.

0790740443|4.0|Written as sort of a sequel to Blade Runner (it takes place within the same universe) by David Peeples (Unforgiven, Blade Runner), Soldier is a rarity now days; it's a B-Movie masquerading as an A movie. I said it was a rarity because it also doesn't have any pretentions to be anything but that. Kurt Russell plays a man born and bred to be a ruthless, brutal soldier. When he's injured, he's discarded like yesterday's news on a planet where much of Earth's waste is dumped. When the latest genetically enhanced soldiers arrive to dispose of the inhabitants of the planet, Russell's character is pushed into action; he's discovered the barest hints of humanity and compassion that was always denied him before. He's taken to these underdogs and they to him almost as a family.<br /><br />In many respects the plot for Solider could have been lifted from a Clint Eastwood Western. Here's The Man With No Name suddenly discovering an emotional core he never knew he had. He helps the less fortunate not because of pity but because he realizes he finally belongs. Russell's performance is masterful. While the Russell doesn't have much dialog, he manages to convey what makes the character tick with  minimum discussion. Russell uses body language to communicate as much as the dialog. In many respects, he's a variation on the character of Rick Deckard from Blade Runner. He's a man of action that ceases to exist between assignments. This cypher like character suddenly discovers he is more than his past and his actions. In the process he rediscovers his own humanity. Soldier makes a complimentary piece to the Mad Max series.<br /><br />The film uses the action and science fiction genre for a springboard to examine a lot of different themes and issues but, make no mistake, it is still an ACTION film. The stunts are well choregraphed and the visual effects effective but it isn't drenched in the CGI we've come to expect movies of this type to have.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is very good as is the audio quality. The extras includes commentary by director Paul W. S. Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil), a theatrical trailer, production notes and both the wide and full screen editions of the movie. My only complaint is the fact that writer David Peeples isn't given any room for a commentary track. Since he's truly the author of the film (and it was intended as a sequel of sorts or companion piece to Blade Runner), it would have been very interesting to get his take on the finished product.<br /><br />Solider isn't Citizen Kane nor does it pretend to be; it's like many of the classic B-Movies of the 50's to the 80's (most notably The Terminator)in that there's far more than meets the eye going on here.The extras includes commentary by director Paul W.

B00009MGQL|4.0|\\"Jeff\\" kicks off with a bang--the kind that can blow your speakers if you're not careful!  \\"So What\\", the intense first track, rather reminds me of the track \\"Dragula\\" from the Matrix soundtrack, except with superior guitar work (this is the song playing when Neo first encounters Trinity).  Immediately you will notice that the mixing on this album heavily favors the bass, enough so that when I first heard it on headphones I thought I had the mega-bass switched on.  <br />\\"So What\\" definitely sets the tone for the rest of the album.  This is indeed a synth-heavy album (and heavy *period*, in many places--this is better for the car than your office cubicle) and sometimes going extremely atonal, but personally I'm into that.  Being a Pink Floyd and Radiohead fan, I am accustomed to atonality and experimentation.  Don't dismiss \\"Jeff\\" offhand simply because reviewers who do not care for that genre gave it a low rating.  Rather, make an educated choice based on your musical tastes.<br />\\"If the voice don't say it, the guitar will play it,\\" says the sampled voice on \\"Pork-U-Pine\\".  This, as with prior work, still holds true.  There were indeed a few times as I listened to this album where I almost believed I was hearing a human voice speaking words or crying out rather than a guitar.  I would have loved to extend the soulful, quiet section of \\"Seasons\\", for instance, but I do like how that part eventually \\"takes over\\" the otherwise hard, driven song.  There, I can hear the kind of work that first drew me to Jeff Beck on Roger Waters' Amused to Death.  I think the biggest highlights are are the first track \\"So What\\", \\"Seasons\\" (PLEASE try to ignore the sampled voice, and hear the beauty of the solo!), \\"JB's Blues\\", and \\"Bulgaria\\"/\\"Why Oh Lord Why\\".  Yes, I have chosen the softest tracks as the best, but I don't dismiss the louder ones.  The others are for me enjoyable listening, even if not standouts.<br />I do have a few criticisms that cost \\"Jeff\\" a star--reviewers who indicate that Mr. Beck's guitar playing gets overshadowed at times are correct.  I think sometimes the guitar is slightly lower in the mix than it should be.  I was hoping to hear more solos with the accompanying instruments (especially the percussion) pulled away in order to hear the subtler nuances of his work.  And yes, I do think there were perhaps too many vocals (\\"Pay Me No Mind\\"), but they did at least tend to be of the repetitive, rhythmic nature that allows one to tune it out fairly easily and focus on what's going on with the other instruments.  But do remember that samples aren't alien to his work--think of \\"Guitar Shop\\".  And in some cases they even become amusing (\\"Hot Rod Honeymoon\\").  However, that aside, I will say I found this purchase worth my money, and a solid 4-star rating.
0449227421|2.0|I have read a few other of Follett's works, and have generally been satisfied with his writing. This book, however, is a major exception. The characters had no depth, the story was completely convoluted, and the writing was cliched. Further, as a psychology researcher, I was outraged at Mr. Follett's description of the research process in the book, as there is absolutely no way that a psychology researcher would ever be allowed to engage in the protocols that he created for this work. Please, do yourself a favor, and don't waste your time with this book.
0446691437|5.0|Without rehashing what this book is about, I want to tell you what it does:  It pushes you to move beyond your current way of thinking about your creativity and removes the obstacles preventing you from taking greater creative actions.  <br />I am not an artist, but rather an entrepreneur.  The morning after I finished the book (it's a very quick read), I took what was previously a half-finished idea, fooled around with it for a while, saw it through to its completion and started using it as a marketing tool right away.  It instantly became one of my most powerful methods for driving customers to my business.  If I had not read the War of Art, the idea might still be unformed and unused.<br />If you're stuck in your way of thinking about problems in art, business or life, give this book a shot.
0375757260|5.0|This novel is brilliant on so many levels. It works as an hilarious send up of societal pretensions, a keen psychological analysis into how we lie to ourselves, and a profound philosophical meditation on the futility of our pursuits large and small. The novel is funny, poignant, and a very enjoyable read - even at 800 pages.
B00005AWMF|1.0|This is the worst piece of ... I've heard in a long time. Heavily arranged pop cheese gathered on one disc. The players are good, the singer is good, but the tunes are pure cheese, while the players are held back from playing anything that's actually musical. If Sade wants to be a jazz singer, she should try singing something with some meat in it, and learn to improvise, as well as let her musicians improvise and swing. This is smooth R&B at it's elevator music blandest.

6302994063|3.0|NOT what I expected. The first few minutes left me feeling disjointed and confused with its rapid-paced asides to the audience, but it calms down a bit into general kookiness. A satire mocking the professional dancing profession, it presents sometimes shocking extremes. I agree with other reviewers about the charm, and certain scenes are undeniably stirring, but they are mixed in with some unsettling hooplah. This is actually not a movie I plan to go back to.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is the album that I needed at this point in my life.  Things not going so well right now, this album became my Prozac.<br />The best way I could describe Postal Service's music is that it is sheer euphoria.<br />It's poppy, the lyrics are lighthearted compared to my Radiohead-heavy album collection, but I find their music beautiful.<br />Remember the feeling that you got in your stomach when you were eight, and the bell would ring right before recess?  That's what this album does for me.
0767812166|4.0|Whats to like: Crisp, believable characters and I don't mean just the leads, even the extras seem to have depth. The special effects seem tame by today's standards but they don't overwhelm the underlying love story and keep the viewer in that all important state of &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;. Good direction and editing keep the storyline moving along at the right pace. This is a &quot;chase&quot; video after all! Both main characters are appealing and remain brilliantly within their characters. The score is really impressive. I still find myself loading up the video just to listen to the end credits now and again!<br />What's not to like: zip. Buy this one for your collection.
038572179X|5.0|Just about anyone who has written a novel, or has ever wanted to, will easily identify with the main character in Atonement. In the beginning, in 1935, the creative thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis is enjoying a childhood filled with private imaginings, which are sometimes converted into public performances. Her story is told in three stages: at thirteen, eighteen, and seventy-seven. The essence of the story is what motivates a novelist -- why do we write? In many cases, we share Briony's insoluble passion: the search for atonement. The word &quot;atone&quot; is a compounding of the phrase &quot;at one,&quot; and, following her offense, this is Briony's goal, to be once more at one with the loved ones she has harmed. But even with all her talent, commitment and skills, how can she bring about the outcome for which she so desperately yearns? How can she bring together the lovers she has parted, and thereby regain their love as well?<br />In Ian McEwan's books, the villans sometimes get off the hook, at least in this life. So the reader should not be too surprised that in Atonement, the guilty are either enjoying a life of successful bliss, or trying to find atonement for irreparable damage to loved ones. The first half of the book is evocative of Remains of the Day in that the &quot;battles&quot; are all social, while the second half of the book switches back and forth between Briony, as she tries to atone for her crime, and Robbie Turner, the son of a family servant, as he flees from the Germans, toward Dunkirk, holding on to his hope of being reunited with his lover, Briony's sister, Cecilia. The writing is deep and rich, the images of war unforgettable. The ending is both surprising and haunting. Atonement is more than worthwhile, it is a must read for thinkers and imaginative people, especially novelists.
0446608955|5.0|If you want a book that's a romantic drama with a great lesson then this is the book for you. In the first chapter you'll probibly think this so boring and you want to stop, but keep reading, 'cause this is a really great book.

0316666343|5.0|It's a rarity, with me, that a book like this can capture my emotions so strongly and leave me wanting to live in this book longer. Sebold spins a tale of life and death that no other author has before her. The main character, Susie Salmon, has been brutally raped and dismembered in the cornfield behind the home she shares with her aloof mother, devoted father, brainy and beautiful younger sister, and 3 year old precocious brother. For the reader, this is not the end of the book, it's only the beginning.  As Susie struggles to come to terms with all she has lost on earth in her version of Heaven, we watch the devastating effects her loss has on her family, and continue with them on their journey through life.  <BR>This book weaves a poignant tale of murder, grief, and moving on after death for not just the living, but the dead as well.  Sebold stirs up the lives of those who knew and loved Susie Salmon in a way that reveals how heroic we ALL are.  This book amazes the senses and leaves you feeling as if you have been part of an amazing journey that has changed you forever.
0393316041|5.0|I developed an interest in (quantum) physics ever since reading Gary Zukhov's The Dancing Wu-Li Masters sometime in the '80s.  I was mesmerised by the whole Shrodinger's Cat thought experiment;  if these really smart people could have a little fun, then, by golly, the science can't be all that impossible to understand.  Then I read Nick Herbert's Quantum Reality.  More of the same...lots of counter-intuitive fun science that has little to do with how my world works [well, it has everything to do with how my world works, but I just don't get to experience it at a primary level].  The last thing I read was Brian Greenes's The Elegant Universe.  I searched high and low for something stimulating, put in terms my little brain could understand.  Nothing.<br />I had picked up Surely You're Joking on numerous occasions.  But I deferred, simply because it was about the scientist instead of the science.  I was interested in the science, not the people behind the science.  I thought, 'A bunch of technically astute individuals who talk waaay above my technically incompetent level.'<br />It's too bad, really.  The scientist behind the science is just as counter-intuitive and remarkable as the science.  A master story teller, Feynman gives wonderful insight into the irreverent antics of one scientist at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.  He gives the reader a layman's view of the world as it is from that of a brilliant thinker.  Safe-cracker, ladies man, artist, anthropologist.  Feynman will not disappoint in keeping you mesmerized by his antics and analysis.  The book is an easy and comfortable read that might just inspire you to find that artist or physicist or lock-pick in you.  Enjoy.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Madonna's first retrospective - 1990's seventeen track Immaculate Collection - was a strong summation that captured most of the hits (although it left off &quot;Angel,&quot; &quot;Dress You Up,&quot; &quot;True Blue,&quot; and the Who's That Girl stuff) and added two new ones (&quot;Justify My Love,&quot; &quot;Rescue Me&quot;).  This second volume includes no new material and includes recordings that weren't hits, some of which weren't even singles.  This is all the more frustrating, as Madonna has grown tremendously as an artist since the first collection.<br />Many of the big omissions on GHV2 - such as &quot;I'll Remember,&quot; &quot;You'll See,&quot; &quot;This Used To Be My Playground,&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; are available on Madonna's Something To Remember collection of ballads from 1995.  I guess Something To Remember could be considered Madonna's Greatest Hits 1.5.  With &quot;Rain&quot; and the top 20 &quot;Bad Girl&quot; left off here, the Erotica album (1992) is represented only by its title track and the pulsating &quot;Deeper And Deeper.&quot;  Meanwhile, all four singles from its follow-up Bedtime Stories (1994) are found here.  &quot;Take A Bow&quot; and &quot;Secret&quot; were big hits and deserve inclusion, but the goofy nightmare &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; and the naughty &quot;Human Nature&quot; both bombed on the charts and aren't among her best recordings (though I do enjoy Madonna's potty mouth on &quot;Human Nature&quot;).<br />From the Evita soundtrack (1997), we get one track, the ballad version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina,&quot; even though it is the snappy dance version (still available only as a cd-single) that became a top ten hit.  Evita's Academy Award winning ballad &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; - which hit the top 20 - is also left off.  Thereafter, Madonna took her music to a new plateau with the Ray Of Light (1998) and Music (2000) cds and it is those albums' singles (&quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; &quot;Power Of Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Music,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;) that help to make this a strong set in spite of its  questionable lineup (I'd have left off Ray of Light's terminal non-single &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For You&quot; however).  <br />Continuing a trend she began early in her career, Madonna has contributed some first-rate recordings to film soundtracks in recent years.  The psychedelic &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; from the Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) is included here, while her effective reworking of &quot;American Pie&quot; from The Next Best Thing (2000) is not.  Hopefully, &quot;American Pie&quot; - and all of the other great recordings missing from her hits collections - will be available on Madonna's upcoming box set.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Women behind bars wear kinky outfits and dance with each other.  Male cast members have minor roles as schmucks and heels, get dumped.  In the end, two women get together and live happily ever after.  Make sure this is your cup of tea before you buy this movie.
0451169514|5.0|Easily my favorite story in 25 years of reading, IT is the penultimate moment where childhood and adulthood diverge.  The story explores the difference between kid-beliefs and grown up-beliefs, and the advantages and disadvantages of each, all set within a terrorized town.<br />I found the seven main characters to be nearly alive, and I missed knowing them when the tale was told.  At a thousand pages, it is hardly a light read, but once you look into the face of IT - of Pennywise - you will not want to close the book.<br />IT is an experience in terror I have never come across again.  It remains the sole novel able to make me laugh aloud, cry, cheer.  Even now as I think about it, I have the urge to look behind me to see if the clown is there.<br />I've read IT five times.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Quite possibly the most important movie of my college experience. During all four years of my education at Niagara University, there was no film that I and my close friends watched more than the Coen Brothers cult-classic &quot;The Big Lebowski.&quot; This film gets better with every viewing, and is the perfect movie for 'guys night out.' The plot is hysterically confusing, but that's what makes this movie so funny. Not only is the script loaded with razor sharp humor, but there are several momenst where the film seems to be making fun of itself, which only adds to the overall enjoyment of this masterpiece. Aside from &quot;Caddyshack,&quot; no movie was quoted more by me and my chums than &quot;The Big Lebowski.&quot; Do yourself a favor, buy this movie, get a couple of cases of 'oat sodas,' invite all of your guy friends over and enjoy. If you are a college student, then you truly haven't experienced dorm life until you hold a midnight screening of this movie. There are several drinking games that you can come up with (as my friends and I so often did) to highten your viewing experience. Make no mistake about it - once you've seen this movie you will be hooked! However, if you see it and hate it, well, that's just like your opinion, man.
0385504209|5.0|Yes, there is no character development, the writing style is something you would expect from a high school student, and there are implausible circumstances. However, it was impossible for me to put this book down. That's the reason why much of us read to begin with. To find something so captivating that all we think about is when we can get back to it. That's enough of a reason for me to recommend this book.
B00009TB5G|2.0|Having read a  couple of dozen reviews by purist and \\"haven't got a clue\\". I was deeply disappointed with the movie.  The cinematography was outstanding and I would love to get Aragorn some shampoo for oily hair.  Legolas definatly has the right hair care products. I really tried to be more open minded through the second film after the first movie's menagerie.  I've seen The Two towers three times and still get so irate.  I realize some concessions had to be made for time restrictions but if we spent less time in Aragorns dream world perhaps actual real life events of the book would have fit in.  I liked the Ents and grudgingly accepted the turn from actual events <BR> BUT where were the Hurons?  They made the Battle of Helms deep really cool.  In the Tolkien trilogy Aragorn was introduced as a foulish character with a fair air.  By Helms deep Aragorn was more regal and spoke with great authority and quickly grew confidence from all the people. The movie Aragorn is still confusing and un-noblish.  What happened to his character developement? Speaking of Rohan where were the sweet rolling  hills of GREEEN GRASS?  Just where was the Gold at the GOLDEN hall?  Where were the FAIR HAIRED and NOBLE people of the Rohirrum? I believe in the Return of the King we're going to see the most warped version of the three books though no real clues were given away in the \\"making of Return of the King\\".   Half the starring cast hadn't read the books or read them during filming. So we can't count on their Tolkien integrity.  I expect the producers haven't read them and Peter Jackson only listened to a really cool Audio drama on CD (thus the \\"Artistic Lisense).<BR>Bottom line I am still young enough to watch a remake in ten years perhaps put on as a BBC or A&E or PBS miniseries. Or even if Amberlin is still in production mode Spielberg may do us the honor.
B000099T2L|1.0|I hate to say it, but this was a waste of my money.  I agree with others that Crazy in Love is about the best song on the album, and just about the only one worth listening to twice.  She doesn't actually sing on the rest of the album, she warbles, and halfway through the CD I couldn't listen anymore, because she doesn't even do that well.  The lyrics are juvenile.  And what's up with the love song to her Dad???  I can't recommend this album to anyone. Try again Beyonce.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The Matrix Reloaded was a great Keanu Reeves movie!  It had action, comedy, great special effects, and more comapred to other Keanu Reeves movies.  It was entertaining to watch for a Keanu movie.  I gave this movie a great grade for a Keanu movie which is 0/10.  Fantastic Keanu Reeves movie.
0375414053|5.0|A co-worker of mine gave it to me as a birthday present, and I couldn't put it down! I've shared it with other friends who juggle the Mom-corporate career world, and everyone's loved it. There were so many neurotic thoughts by Kate with which I could identify (and some that made me feel better, thinking \\"Well, I'm not THAT bad!\\"). A must-read for the working mom!
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie is awful. \\"Why?\\" ..you might ask... Well, simply because all the CG is deadly wrong, plain pathetic and totally unrealistic ! Such an expensive movie to have a CG animated Hulk that moves so badly and it's totally out of the screen...it's a real shame, indeed! The production should be really sorry for having produced such a low-level CG movie. The whole CG Hulk character is really out of the screen, it's like a hand drawn cartoon overlaid on real images--read: BAD ANIMATION! The CG Hulk character doesn't look real, doesn't move as a true lifeform and doesn't look inside the scenes at all. They should have learned from Lord of The Rings CG animations where unreal creatures looked absolutely real and full embedded with real images. The Hulk has been as much expensive as that probably but results are the worst ever seen to date. It looks like a B movie overall. Avoid it !
B0000648WZ|5.0|Campy, hilarious and bugs, bugs, bugs! This movie was a complete joy ride for me. It was also an emotional roller coaster. One minute I was ticked off that my favorite character was killed, the next minute I was laughing at some of the crazyness that was going on. You gotta see this movie!
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce Knowles is the ultimate talent behind \\"Destiny's Child.\\"  Everyone knows it, and this album proves it.  The first single from the album \\"Crazy in Love\\" is fast-paced, and gets you ready for this album.  \\"Baby Boi\\" with Sean Paul is another favorite, sure to be a single.  We finally get a ballad with \\"Me, Myself and I\\" and \\"Yes,\\" with both songs showing Ms. Knowles can blow with the best of them.  I loved the remake of \\"Dangerously in Love,\\" and watching her do this on the VH1 Divas was a treat.  <br />I was not too crazy about \\"Signs.\\"  Too much astrology can be bad for you.  Nor did I care for the remake of \\"Closer I Get to You\\" with Luther Vandross.  I just had a hard time hearing a 20-something young lady and the 50-something Vandross wanting to get closer.  Also, the \\"Daddy\\" song (hidden track) was sweet, but did it really need to go on the album?<br />Overall, I think this effort is very promising from this young lady from my home state.  I hope in the next album, she does not use so many guest artists.  She can carry an album on her own.  However, the more solo she gets from \\"Destiny's Child\\" the more confident she'll grow.

B00005JKYI|4.0|Somebody's eyes are watching...<br />So this film was made during the mid eighties, so what? I thought it was a pretty good movie, during it's time and still is whenever I watch it on DVD.  I particularly don't think it was a dumb movie. For those who bag this movie, please do some research first and you'll be surprised to know that there are some states or towns that, unfortunately, still ban dancing and rock music for which this movie was based on. My question is, who isn't cashing in on teen dance movies or teen dance music to this day? Yeah sure, some people might be ashamed of certain past decades and wonder how we even went through those years with certain fads, fashion and music, but still Footloose was a hit in those days as rap is with this current decade, not to mention all those generic and mass produced all boy or all girl dance groups currently around with similar or the same style dance moves and tunes. I believe Footloose can still hold it's own with some of today's movies, disregarding the decade it was made in. I also agree with everything Priscilla from Japan reviewed on the movie. Excellent and thoroughly enjoyed!<br />Going back to \\"Footloose\\" itself, I thought the music selected was perfect for the movie. Why else would they have recently produced a stage show/play production of the movie? The first time I saw Footloose in 1984, I got so hooked on the music, I bought the soundtrack the next day and listened to it for months on my walkman. It was also the only music I took with me during my first time vacation to the States in 1984. I love all the songs on it and to this day, I still think the Footloose soundtrack is one of my top 10 soundtack favorites. I'm glad that the record company re-released the soundtrack with extra tracks from the movie. I only wish that there were extras and special features added into the DVD. Perhaps Paramount Home Video will re-release a \\"20th Anniversary Footloose Special Edition\\" DVD with extra special features intime for 2004.<br />Was this review helpful to you?
B000059XUO|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that when this movie was released, I wasn't in a rush to see it. Needless to say, I ate my words. <BR>I absolutely love this film! <br />&quot;The Crow&quot; tells the story of Eric Draven, a young rock star who's life is devoted to his art and his fiancee, Shelly Webster. When hoodlums brutally murder them both in their apartment on Halloween, Eric is resurrected and returns to avenge his and Shelly's murderers one by one. The Crow is born.<BR>Yes, the movie is dark, gloomy and violent, but that doesn't take away from its substance. This movie has heart. It tells everyone that true love survives even in death. <br />Brandon Lee, forever remembered now for is accidental and ill-timed death while this film was in production, has never looked so beautiful. He plays this tortured soul so effortlessly but still adds a little humor to the somber mood. The action is great, the dialogue is great. In a nutshell, everything about this movie is great. You'd be missing out if you refused to see this. <br />As Eric Draven said...&quot;It's not a good day to be a bad guy.&quot;
B0000AXE8I|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS LIKE A THOUGHT-BOMB ON A TIMER... IT DROPS IN YOUR MIND, LINGERS, AND THEN WILL SUDDENLY EXPLODE! (it all depends on how ready you are for it.) the ideas in this movie are so immense, so intense, so... awesome, it's hard to imagine that people just brashly dismissed it.  this movie will go down in history as the one that everyone will be embarrassed to say they didn't like, or worse, didn't understand.  when the Matrix Revolutions comes out, the Matrix Reloaded will be hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made. why? because this movie is the first two acts, of a powerful movie about self-discovery in the midst of an apocalyptic, cyber-science-fiction-future war. the makers of the movie have all said that they don't want to give answers to their movie that's about finding your own answers, but to skim the surface, let's just say that to start with, it's about PURPOSE. knowing your purpose. finding your purpose. what is purpose? if you don't know, or don't care... then you haven't explored that side of you. this movie will plant a seed that I can only say will bloom either with your help, or on it's own when you're walking down the street one day. but when it does, YOU WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. this movie rocks, and does all of this amidst MINDBLOWING EFFECTS SEQUENCES AND MULTIPLE, PULSE-POUNDING, NEAR-ENDLESS KUNG-FU BATTLES! you will NOT be sorry you bought this movie.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I just really can't write a good review of this right now.  All I can say is that these movies (especially the first two) are, quite literally, the best works of film ever created.  Italian, latin classics of patriarchal hierarchy.
B000002UAF|5.0|The Beatles, is a legendary rock and roll band that &quot;blew up&quot; during the 60's and 70's.  Their music, simple yet effective, are a pleasure to listen too.  This album I had to get after I saw &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; movie.  I loved the music performances of this group in the movie, especially &quot;If I Fell&quot;.  I got goose bumps when John Lennon started to sing the first few lines, then Ringo starts the melow drumbeat, then the whole group starts to sing.  Very effective stuff.  Other performances and musical numbers were excellent as well.  I know that their music is not complex, which some people bring up about them.  These people don't get it, it's the simple stuff that the Beatles can do with their music and yet have a hypnotizing effect on the audience is what makes these guys geniuses.  The music they have still is loved by music lovers of todays generation.  Well, this is a great album of early music from the Beatles.  Their more mature albums are great too.  I recommend this album to music fans.
B00006V9A0|4.0|First off, I love Nirvana but this album is not the best investment for a long-time Nirvana fan.  Yeah, there are a few tracks on here that have not been released in mass quantity before like the previously unreleased song 'You Know You're Right' (by far one of the most enticing Nirvana songs of all time), and the Single versions of 'Been a Son' and 'Pennyroyal Tea', but for the hardcare follower, that's all this album really has to offer. There isn't anything in here that you probably don't already have or even seen within the pages of it's liner notes.  However, for the blossoming Nirvana fanatic, this is a great place to start.  It's the perfect introduction to the band as it covers all the bases quite well.  Though it really could have fit in a few more tracks that are noticably missing like 'Love Buzz', 'Blew', 'On a Plain', 'Polly', 'Aneurysm', 'Molly's Lips', 'Serve the Servants', and an obscene amount of other live/studio rarities from the Outcesticide Bootlegs, all the singels are well represented.  I would still say however, that in order to fully appreciate Nirvana you should own there entire catalogue.  It doesn't seem right to pick appart such classic albums like 'Nevermind' and 'In Utero' and REALLY call it the best representation of this group.  But unlike some bands, these songs are strong enough to stand by themselves and do so quite nicely.  Though this is an obvious attempt by the record companies to once again capitolize on Kurt's tortured life, you should still go out and grab a copy for it is a testament to the brilliance and songwriting abilities of one of our generations greatest poets.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I dont know what these guys are complaining about.  This movie was awesome.  In the beginning it drags a little, but it is necessary, for it goes deep into the comic books roots.  If you are not 10 years old like some of these reviewers, and you were a fan of the hulk when you were young, definitely cop this dvd.  It's off the hook.
B0000844IT|5.0|certain movies are good because of their very terribleness.  this is one of the best examples I've EVER seen of this phenomenon.  cheesy, campy, over the top ridiculo action against the undead that speaks straight to me.
B000001GS4|4.0|Having had all Argerich's recordings on Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No.1, I can hardly claim that this one is the best. Firstly, I don't think BPO does a good job because it draws back the passion that is typical in Argerich's playing.  BPO tends to favor slow and more majestic rendition, that can be heard in other recordings of this orchestra (Listen to Richter's Tchaikovsky No.1 under the baton of Karajan, which is quite a disappointing rendition).  Secondly, I think Argerich plays very tentatively, meaning that she sounds as if she were a novice who is afraid of any mistake.  This is actually quite reasonable. Because in the live performing version of this same piece that is collected in the Rachmaninov No.3 CD, she has made many mistakes in particularly the last movement. I guess she is afraid of making more mistakes...^_^.  All what I said does not mean that Argerich is not a suitable pianist in interpreting this work.  Indeed, her live performance with Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Kazimier Kord is a much better recording. That recording embodies all the aspects of Argerich's being one of the greatest pianists, her passion, her technic tour de force, and her daring to play on the edge. All in all, this CD is worth buying only because of the Nutcracker Suite. I think everybody will enjoy it very much. But if you wanna enjoy a superb rendition of Tchaikovsky No.1 Piano Concerto, please get the one with Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Kazimier Kord.
B000002ADT|5.0|Albums come and go, they are forgotten and remembered, as are the people that made them.  Once in awhile, though, there comes along a masterpiece the likes of which could only have been created through nothing short of divine inspiration.  This, folks, is it.  The desert island album to end all desert island albums.  There is not a false note to be heard - everything appears planned to perfection, when in fact Miles only had rough sketches planned out a few hours before recording.  This is the sound of six brilliant men and what happens when they allign like the planets.  It is the sound of pure spontaneity.  It is the sound of perfection.
B000002UUX|5.0|Hands down the best metal album of all time. No other metal album can be mentioned on the same level as Rust In Peace. It's perfect. If your a metal fan and do not own this, there is somthing wrong with you. Thundering riffs, anti-government lyrics, Pounding drums and bass, and masterful shred solos by Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine are what make this album so incredible. Dave's voice is at it's best here as well, singing with emotion sarcasm and anger. Rust In Peace is the perfect metal album. So buy it already.
B00005JKZV|2.0|ranks as just about as nearly as bad as the second Star Wars (money....) movie in terms of complete disapointment.  a sprawling, directionless, monotonous mess filled to the brim with : unrealistic way too polished looking computer FX (like I haven't seen this ruin a movie before, ahem the new star wars syndrome, ahem), terrible, confused actors on par with low budget computer game cut scenes, and generic, irritating \\"medieval fairy war\\" music that will shake your brains right out of your head (perhaps an attempt to make you gaze in awe at this poor pathetic attempt at a film).  All in all the experience was like having to sit through a very long and somewhat bad \\"in between mission\\" computer graphic laden cut scene in some geeks \\"medieval battle\\" computer game.  this ... - and yes, read the book instead.  the end.
B0000A98ZP|2.0|&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is the brat pack movie that I venture to guess will be long remembered as a watershed moment in American cinema - at least where teen comedy is concerned.  The plot (for those not already familiar with it) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life, forced to sit together through one Saturday afternoon detension session. A hilarious, well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundemental truths that make us all human, John Hughes &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is perhaps the single greatest exploration of the angst and confusion that plagued us all during the high school years.  <BR>UNIVERSAL's remastering efforts on this DVD provide some angst of their own. Despite being anamorphically enhanced for 16X9 displays, this newly minted DVD offers nothing in the way of video improvement over the previously issued DVD.  Colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with some bleeding and smearing.  Fine detail is minimal, even in well lit scenes.  Contrast, shadow and black levels are all extremely weak. Age related artifacts, including chips, scratches and spice jump cuts are all evident. There is a considerable amount of film grain present throughout for a wholly unsatisfying visual presentation.  The audio - remixed to 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS exhibits a dated characteristic with muffled dialogue and practically no spacial separation, except in the music tracks.  <BR>EXTRAS: A Theatrical trailer that is badly worn.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a brilliant movie.  However, the lack of extras (a documentary would have been nice)and the really low brow treatment of the transfer lead me to say this disc really isn't worth the money.
B000002J1U|5.0|No one quite expected Led Zeppelin, perhaps the heaviest blues-rock band in 1969, to come out with some of the most beatiful acoustic songs they ever written. There was a few acoustic songs here and there (Your Time Is Gonna Come, Black Mountain Side, Thank You, Ramble On), but no one expected half of their albums to be acoustic songs. And that's what they did. Pretty cool.<br />However, those fans who are more into the electric songs will be pleased by Side 1. Immigrant Song remains to this day one of the most complex songs Led Zeppelin ever did. I don't mean complex as in a Yes-40-piece-orchestra way, it's just that the guitar riff and drumline are very hard to play and is one of the toughest songs to cover from Led Zeppelin. Friends is a interesting Indian-sounding song with a nice drone. Celebration Day is another weird rocker with a strange sounding intro. The solo Jimmy Page does, to me, is one of the best solos he ever did. However, Since I've Been Loving You is probably the best song on the album. The production is VERY good. John Bonham's bass drum is superbly miked, and everyone is in top form. It's too bad this song sucked on the DVD. Out On The Tiles is a fun song with some great riffs and top notch singing.<br />Side 2 is all acoustic. Gallows Polw, a traditional song later covered by Leadbelly (check him out too), fits Led Zeppelin well. That's The Way is the prettiest Zeppelin song ever made. Good for insomniacs. Tangerine isn't so great. I never liked it when Zeppelin branched into country. Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp is one of the best tributes to bluegrass ever. It's the best bluegrass song by a heavy metal band. Hats Off To (Roy) Harper is a unbelieveably great Delta blues song with excellent singing by Plant. Weird way to end the album though.<br />This is a great highlight for Zeppelin, along with any of the early albums. This is up there with the 1st for favorites.
0802136834|5.0|Alsion Weir is a very talented writer, who certainly knows her stuff when it comes to Tudor history.  When we read this book, we come to understand the forces of the dynasty that created the man who would become the great Henry the Eighth, and the needs of his kingdom that drove his obsession to sire a son.<br />History has tended to relegate Henry's wives into some simplistic catergories - Catherine of Aragon as the dowdy hard done by cast-off; infamous Anne Boleyn as a woman who played for high stakes and lost; and sweet Jane Seymour, who gave Henry his son but sadly died.  Then there were the other three wives who somehow never seemed so fascinating, and as such have had much less of the limelight.  But never were there six more different women, and each has made their impact on history in a number of different ways.<br />Alsion Weir has written this book with such richness and attention to detail, that at times you forget that you are reading non-fiction and get swept away in the fervour that can come with a great novel.  But never has the imagination given an author such rich fodder as Henry and his love life, and his increasing desperation to sire more children as he got older.  The six women that graced his life so so long or for such a short period of time are well defined, and we come to care for all of them as the book progresses.  We come to understand their wishes and desires, and we feel sorrow for them as we see that frequently they were only pawns in the great dynastic chess game of the time.  And of course we catch a glimpse of the other Tudors - the deeply religious Mary, who was forever scarred by her mother's treatment; Edward who was manipulated by his mother's family, and finally Elizabeth, who grew up branded a bastard and for many years feared the retribution that may have followed her mother's fall from favour.<br />Not only is this a really great read, it is also a meticulously researched and presented reference book, one which will be treasured for many years to come.ured for many years to come.
0140067477|1.0|The contempt the author repeatedly expressed for both science and education made this book inappropriate for my young boys, ages 4 and 6.  The author used the cute characters to mask his contempt for many of the things I value in my life, and you perhaps value in yours.<br />I read this book at night to my 4 and 6 year olds. My four year old had chosen to read The Book of Pooh four times in a row.  I had used his interest in Pooh to help him learn other things, like math and drawing. I saw this book as a way to introduce some big philosophical concepts.<br />This may very well be an introduction to Tao, I don't know. If \\"The Way\\" means basically \\"To Criticize\\" then this is it. The author's point seems to be \\"Be Like Pooh.\\" The problem is, he cannot do it himself.  If the author acted more like Pooh, his book would not be so objectionable to my children. Can you imagine Pooh criticizing at all?<br />When the author started talking about science as pointless and silly, my 6 year old (who was sitting in) asked what was wrong with science? He wants to be a scientist.  And when the author went on on a tirade about academics and school and even (ironically) books, I was shocked.  My boys are both in classes of some sort, and they don't know what to do with the author's low opinion of school.<br />There were many of these gems of knowledge.  One other one I remember is that exercise is worthless. Better he says to just lay on the grass. No kidding. My kids are very active (as is Pooh) and I hope they are active their whole lives.  The advice in this book is questionable at best, and totally inappropriate for children.  If you are an adult, have failed at school, and sit on a couch all day, then this book will provide you with a justification.<br /><br />The author is a Talk Radio DJ, in the disguise as a mystic, putting on a puppet show starring Pooh.  He hijacks a childhood hero to vent his frustration at a failed college career. Underneath his \\"be simple, like Pooh\\" message is a great deal of anger and frustration that bubble to the surface in ill-chosen exaggerations about \\"narrow minded science\\" and \\"irrelevant academia\\" and joggers.  Did he not get tenure at Cal Tech, or something?  While he derides science as pointless study, one wonders if he drives a car, takes medicine, prints his books on printing presses, travels by some other means than his feet, in short... does he benefit from science?  If so, the word \\"hypocrite\\" springs to mind.<br />We never finished the book.  My four year old, who is FAR more Pooh-like than the author, simply knew that something wasn't right, and would actually pick another book and read it silently while I read this book aloud.  He had never done that before, or since, and it was his Pooh way of telling me that this guy wasn't appropriate.  So when my six year old asked, \\"How can he be against books - when he wrote one?\\"  we stopped.  The boy had a point.  Any author of a book who derides authors and readers of books for being too academic is clearly a fool.<br />The author does not have the inner peace and sense of fun and play that Pooh possesses.  Instead, he parades these cute characters about and (from time to time) sneers hate-filled generalizations about things he chooses not to respect.  I hear his second book is the same, but worse.  If that is \\"The Way\\" then count me out.age is a great deal of anger and frustration that bubble to the surface in ill-chosen exaggerations about \\"narrow minded science\\" and \\"irrelevant academia\\" and joggers.

B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan has everything a pop/punk band needs to be #1!! Their songs have great tunes and awesome lyrics, not to mention a great beat, acompanied by the talented voices of the band.  I recommend this album to any hip hop, rock or punk lover. Simple Plan brings all three together in an album that totally rocks!!!  When you hear it you will GET UP AND DANCE!!!
B000002J03|4.0|I seem to enjoy a lot of bands who make multiple albums in one year. Led Zeppelin is one of them. What's really cool is that 9 months after the 1st album, they made the 2nd album. Anyway, yes, I know, Led Zeppelin doesn't credit their blues songs. But, you wanna know something? Blues has been around for a very long time. No one person has sat down and made it up. <br />Anyway, the album starts with Whole Lotta Love, one of the signature Led Zeppelin songs. It's a great rocker and perhaps Led Zeppelin's most succesful single (#4 in the U.S.). What Is And What Should Never Be is another good balance of light and dark, though it's not exactly dark sounding. Good guitar solo. The Lemon Song is a fun blues jam that is the longest song on the album (6:19). Anyone hoping for long jamming will kind of be dissapointed on this album. Thank You is a decent ballad with nothing special except a organ solo at the end that fades out, then fades in. Heartbreaker is a great rocker that's unbelievable live (even though there's very few live footage of it, I managed to hear it on the BBC. Very cool.). Living Loving Maid sucks. Way too pop for Led Zeppelin. Ramble On is a decent folk rock song with some cool overdubbed leads. Moby Dick is a great song live, but on the album, it's a bit flat. The drums aren't properly miked. Bring It On Home is a very good rock/delta blues song that just fits the mood of the album perfectly.<br />The album isn't as good as the 1st, which isn't suprising. I like the ballads, but they could've done without Thank You and Living Loving Maid. I wish they put in Travelling Riverside Blues, or better yet, We're Gonna Groove.
0385504209|4.0|I give this book 3.5 stars.  The DaVinci code is basically the story of a grand scavenger hunt that deals with some of the most fundamental issues in western culture.  Dan Brown's writing style is a bit basic and won't lead this book to instant recognition as a classic, but it is a fun read, a real page turner and I can certainly understand its best selling status.<br />The book divides itself between three or so plot threads - by the middle of the book nearly every chapter is ending with a mini-clifhanger and compells the reader to keep reading until the clifhanger is resolved.  Its a good story and doesn't take a PhD in mathematics or art history to follow - this is both good and bad - I felt that the plot was not quite as intricate as it might have been based on other similarly themed works I've read recently - on the other hand, it was very involving while remaining easy to follow.<br />In the end, though, I was dissapointed that the plot did not seem to get as intricate as it potentially could have, and to me the ending left a little to be desired in that payoff from the grand quest undertaken by the two main characters is more or less left unspoken, even though the book spends most of its ~450 pages building anticipation for exactly that.<br />For those who liked this book and would like to read a somewhat similar story with a bit more depth, I'd recommend Neal Stephenson's &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;.
B000002GVO|5.0|I'm sure that there have been many interpretations written about the Eagles title track, Hotel California.  I'm also sure that there are many references in the song that I'm unaware of, but I am sure of one thing.  In the first song on this album, the Eagles are writing about the high and irreparable cost of fame.  The last line says it all, &quot;You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.&quot;  Once you become famous, there is no going back.  It isn't like you can simply turn it &quot;off&quot;, when you feel that it is just too much.<br />Although not my most favorite Eagles album, there are some very good songs on this album, and another really good instrumental, the Wasted Time Reprise.<br />Although in my opinion this is not the best Eagles album, it is probably the best representative album of the 1970's.  Much like the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper Album is representative of the 1960's.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|Here's my review of the album:<br />\\"Not Gonna Get Us\\"- second single; heard the Dave Aude remix, which is phat. It could fit for motion picture or they should get more people on the video besides the two of them. I rated this one 9/10<br />\\"All The Things She Said\\"- first single; the video was...interesting and I prefer the Hardrum mix, which the beat is so suscipious and kinda sexy. I also heard the Extension 119 Club mix and it's phat, too. I rated this one 9/10<br />\\"Show Me Love\\"- possibly the third single to be released; the beat was thumping and they kinda shout it out their love for one another. I rated this one 8/10<br />\\"30 Minutes\\"- that's a pretty song; it's about 30 minutes to do whatever before something happens.....the laughter in the background and dramatic piano notes makes it a very sad tune. I rated this one 10/10<br />\\"How Soon Is Now?\\"- Smiths' cover; way better than the original. If \\"Charmed\\" wants to do another season, they should put this one. It's also an European single; I rated this one 7/10<br />\\"Clowns (Can You See Me Now?)\\"- I just like the beat, that's all. I rated this one 7/10<br />\\"Malchik Gay\\"- Well, it's alright, but me, personally, I should do a techno remix on it. I rated this one 7/10<br />\\"Stars\\"- it's \\"30 Minutes\\" part two, with Juila's rapping on the background. I rated this one 9/10<br />\\"Ya Shosla S Uma\\"- Russian version; I like this one better. I rated this one 10/10<br />And finally:<br />\\"Nas Ne Dagoniat\\"- Russian version; I like the music video and they kinda shout it out on it, too. I rated this one 9/10.<br />That's my review.....
B00005JKZV|5.0|Arguably better than the first installment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, The Two Towers is a more than seamless continuation of the first film.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to destroy the ring, and are now guided by the deceitful Gollum.  Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join the fight to defend the city of Rohan as Saruman (Christopher Lee) and his dark lord Sauron proceed with their plan of the eradication of mankind.  More violent, fast paced, and with a more epic feel; The Two Towers is, as of this typing, the best action/fantasy adaptation yet; and while it may not take place exactly as Tolkien himself had written it, he himself would nod his head in approval of the fantastic job done by director Peter Jackson.  Most of the cast from Fellowship of the Ring has returned: including Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Hugo Weaving, and Andy Serkis providing his movements and voice as Gollum, who is a fantastic pinnacle of how far computer animation has come today.  The battle scenes are more than epic; including the climatic slickly put together battle of Helm's Deep.  All this however is only a taste of what is to come with the third and final film in the trilogy: the eagerly anticipated The Return of the King.
B000002GXX|5.0|When I found out that the very familiar &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; radio and TV series theme music was an Eagle's instrumental called &quot;Journey Of The Sorcerer&quot;, as soon as I owned a CD player, I went right out and bought this album.  The instrumental song is a very interesting, as well as the longest track, on the album.  Other songs that aren't radio airplay songs, but I still love them anyway are &quot;Visions&quot;, and &quot;After The Thrill Is Gone&quot;.<br />After buying this album, I evenually purchased all six of the Eagles albums from 1972 to 1979.  If it weren't for Douglas Adams, author of the Hitchhiker's Guide series, I would not have become such a big Eagles fan.
B000000OAH|3.0|1978 saw Queen retaining their unquenchable self-belief, but struggling somewhat to maintain the standards of their first 6 albums, particularly in the song writing and album sequencing departments. Firstly, why didn't they open this album with Let Me Entertain You? This would have been as arresting an opener as Death On Two Legs was on A Night At The Opera. Nevermind...Mustapha opens proceedings with a quirky blast - I didn't really 'get' this number till I listened in the phones and heard it explode in widescreen with Brian's double-tracked guitars. Awesome! Fat Bottomed Girls is ludicrous, but fun. I find it hard to resist Brian's rockers, and despite the ridiculous words this has the feel of a Queen classic. Jealousy is a fine Freddy ballad, with some lovely acoustic flourishes from Brian. Bicycle Race, like FBG, is ridiculous, but irresistable! I don't think there's too many bands one can say that about. The musicianship and complex arrangement win through, although in terms of emotional impact, I don't think Bicycle/Fat was a patch on Rock You/Champions the previous year. I'm not a fan of most of John Deacon's songs - Best Friend and Dust being the exceptions, and I think his two songs here, If You Can't Beat 'Em and In Only Seven Days, are pop fluff. Queen usually managed to put interesting touches into all their arrangements, but John's songs too often sound like they could have been written for any forgettable 70s pop band. Let Me Entertain You is another fun, hard-rocking and not-a-little-camp number, with great riffing and drumming. Brian's Dead On Time contains mind-boggling riffing from the guitar maestro - a reminder of why he and Queen are still feted as visionaries by subsequent generations of rocking bands. Brian also shines with the lovely harmonies of Leaving Home Ain't Easy, and the jazz-blues atmospherics of Dreamers Ball. This song sounds more like a vaudevillian Freddie number, until you remember that Brian also wrote Good Company. I'm not a huge fan of Roger's songwriting either - although he does have some good rocking numbers on the earlier albums. His work here, though, truly is not up to scratch. Both Fun It and More Of That Jazz are not really songs as such - they're just ideas. Of course there are the usual nice touches, particularly from Brian, but they're not enough to turn these pieces into anything approaching memorable songs. So, overall this album doesn't suffer from its diversity as such: it suffers from the lacklustre efforts of some of the song writing. Although this album feels like the end of an era for me, in terms of Queen's loveably bombastic 70s work, it also gives an indication of what was to come - simpler recordings, 'drier' drum sounds and a bunch of filler on each album. Ah well, they had a good run - and their next album, The Game, contains at least 5 great songs. If you're a Queen fan, however, I would recommend buying Jazz, and indeed any of their first eight albums - they all have fantastic album tracks that you won't find on any Greatest Hits compilation.

B00005JM02|2.0|I, Robby Genepri, have languished long and hard while critiquing this film through and through for any revolting gratuitous cartoon violence.  After finding little to boot, I must admit that I am still taken aback by the sheer audacity of Disney to release a cartoon film that encourages fish to fend for themselves.  I feel it incumbent upon the cartoon industry to underscore the increasing importance of interdependence, or collectivism, if you will.  Nemo, in his despicable American individualism, sours the taste in my Marxist socialist palate.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil does it again.  With this album, Neil transports us to a place of his making, but with descriptions so vivid, and moving, you are sucked right into Greendale.  You come to know the Green family so well, that everything that they do, or that happens to them seems so real.  Cousin Jed would have to be my favorite.  \\"Leave The Driving\\" Track 4 and \\"Bandit\\" Track 6 are my favorite two tracks on the album.  I would have to say this is my second favorite album of Neil's, second only to Decade, which isnt quite fair since its truly his Greatest Hits.  I have yet to watch the bonus DVD that comes with this, but as good as his shows are, Im sure its great as well.  Do yourself a favor, if you like Neil or not, you are sure to enjoy something about this album.  Check it out...
B000002L9B|4.0|Aside from the old pop and new wave formulas that imitators and stars of that time were overusing, Prince makes it clear he is not into being a follower; this is evident with the opening track of this CD: Christopher Tracy's Parade. Filled with masterful lyrics and rhythmic and melodic riffs ahead of its time, the listener is definitely experiencing a Parade! Most of the music on the first side of Parade is music no one has dared to venture as an 80s pop icon except Prince. Who could top avante garde &quot;Christopher Tracy's Parade&quot; to  &quot;Life Can Be So Nice&quot; to the classical &quot;Venus DeMilo&quot;, followed by the ultra funky &quot;Kiss&quot; in the same album? I'm a classical musician myself and can truly say that this is music that will be around to further demonstrate Prince's musical artistry. On a more philosophical note, the music illustrates a man's parade in search of true love. Forget critics who keep comparing him to his earlier works and their utter disappointment that he didn't continue in the same vein as Purple Rain. Prince is an artist, and one thing I've observed from this album is that Prince was moving forward in a different direction. Great Album to the Prince fanatic;meaning those who understands his vision. And probably an obscure one to the non-Prince fanatic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Among all the current science fiction series--Enterprise, Andromeda, Farscape, SG1 etc. Firefly was easily the best. The chemistry between the crew members, the depth and edge all the characters had, the witty dialogue, all contributed to make this a very intelligent and entertaining show. Yet I can see how it might not appeal to everyone--you can't just watch the gunfights, but actually have to think about the moral issues, and follow the stories to learn more about the characters. If you do, there is so much more depth here than your typical space show.
B00003CXD5|5.0|You can use a ton of special effects, CGI or whatnot but you cannot beat a great plot, exceptional acting and an inspired director. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre had them all.<br />The complexity of the human mind is explored throughout the movie. We have the wise old-timer, sensible Curtain and man-on-the-edge Dobbs who eventually plummets over into insanity before being slaughtered for his clothes by a group of Mexican bandits lead by the superb Alfonso Bedoya, a role he played to some aplomb in a number of movies of that time.<br />There isn't a lot more to say about this movie other than if you haven't yet seen it, then purchase this DVD poste haste and spend a couple of hours with some true Hollywood Greats.

0679736646|5.0|I've been reading the works of Philip K. Dick for several years now, and have read most of his more well-known works, thought I still have a lot to go. I have read a lot of books from many different genres, including the classics and technical writings, and the books of Philip K. Dick are, in many ways, the most complex of them all. Ubik was not his most original or creative work, as the author himself admitted, but is a great blending of many of the elements that make up the PhiDickian universe. Here we find Dick toying with many of his favorite themes:  paranoia, isolation, alienation, paranormal phenomenon, and, of course, the slippery nature of reality. Ubik works on several levels, as do all of Dick's books; one is a quasi-detective story, which will interest the average reader with its suspense and intrigue, and another is as a dark metaphysical comedy. Much of the book is funny, in its way, wavering from black humor to near-slapstick. All the time, we are drawn further and further into the world of the book as weirdness piles upon weirdness and the mystery of the book thickens. Like all PKD, it is superbly and complexly plotted -- almost unimaginably so. His works never cease to amaze me. How did he come up with this stuff? It is almost incredible that he did -- and so easily and quickly at that. Dick spits out immensely imaginative subplots and asides that lesser authors could build an entire career on. His plots are the most complex I have ever encountered in literature, surpassing even the convuluted multiplexity of other science fiction works. Dick had a truly incredible imagination. That said, Ubik, as with all PKD, is very tightly written and extremely focused; though all of his books contain enough material for years of pondering, most all of them are around the 200 page range. Not a word is wasted. Aside from the ideas -- Dick peppers all of his books with philosophical asides, caustically witty remarks, and laugh-out-loud funny dialogues -- Dick is always worth reading for his superb writing and masterful technique. Ubik is quite a disorienting read at first:  it drops right into the middle of the story, and it will take the reader a little bit to come to grips with what is going on (as another reviewer pointed out, another author would've spend many pages setting this part of the story up.) As with the best PKD, just when it all starts to come together in one's mind, the book takes a completely different turn, and everything that one has thought up to that point is eradicated. And then it makes another twist, destroying again everything that had come before. And then another. And then, finally, the ending offsets everything that has come before and puts the entire book in a different light. Only Philip K. Dick could make this work. This is a rich, rewarding, and immensely engrossing work that is complex, funny, and highly entertaining. I finished it several days ago, and have been pondering it -- but I'm still not sure I understand the ending. Or the book at all. I almost always have this feeling after reading Dick. Is there something more? What did I miss? One always wants to read the book all over again. That is the true mark of a great author.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Oh my god, was this movie bad!  I forced myself to get to the end of it to see if it got any better.  I was disappointed!  What happened to Ben Affleck?  He used to be able to act. (Or maybe he was just good at playing the same character over and over again!)  Characters looked happy to be killed so they could escape from the set!  Don't waste your money!
B00000K2SC|5.0|The best movie period.  Truly deep philosphic ideas surrounded by some excellent si-fi effects.
B0000A02TZ|2.0|From the moment I opened up the DVD case I was let down.  The only insert card on the inside case is some coupons to buy some useless [fluff].  No chapter reference card.  How cheap can you get.  Once I inserted the DVD, another dissapointment.  You are forced to watch some [fluff] \\"Upcoming\\" commercials.  These can not be Chapter searched past, fast forwarded, and you can't hit the menu button.  This is even worse than Disney releases.  At least you can chapter past the commercials.  Thanks Universal, for a less then spectacular re-release for a great movie.  You should be ashamed.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold are a band that have a heavy sound, but mix in many different influences in their music, (such as punk, hardcore/metalcore, melodic metal, glam/80's metal, and even some acoustic stuff.) But with this album, I was kind of dissapointed. There are some amazing tracks such as the epic 2-part masterpiece &quot;I Wont See You Tonight&quot; and the melodic metal track &quot;Chapter Four&quot;, but then there are a handfull of filler tracks as well. The great thing about &quot;Sounding The Seventh Trumpet&quot; was how each song sounded different and nothing like the rest. With this album, they relied more on the melodic metalcore approach, causing some songs to sound the same. It'll take some time to grow. The vocals on their last cd were a lot better as well, as well as the drums. If you're just getting into the band, then I'd recommend you check out Sounding The Seventh Trumpet first. If you liked the last one, then you'll prob like this. Eventhough I said some negative things about it, I still gave it 4 stars. Its above average, just not like the other one.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Now don't get me wrong, I was a HUGE fan of the first Matrix film, and like many, I could not wait to see this movie. About 25 minutes into the film, my hopes were dashed. Forget for one second the mind-blowing special effects, which in my opinion are some of the finest ever put on the screen (the chase scene is incredible), and we are left with a movie that suffers from every single symptom of the sophomore slump. The script, while sharp in spots, is laugh-inducing... While the W brothers have high-minded ideas about where they want this story to head, they are stuck in the messiah loop... How many times do we have to watch Keanu Reeves stare off in space in divine speculation? For this viewer, it was about fifteen times too many. The Zion orgy scene was also rather annoying. The final few moments of the film held a ray of hope, however. I don't want this review to discourage fans of the Matrix from seeing Reloaded, just don't let the hype fool you. I hope Revolutions has some of the first films magic. Sadly, this one was found lacking in many areas.
B000002IAZ|4.0|This is a nice little package from &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot;. They surely were one of the great groups from that era. &quot;For What it's Worth&quot; has got to be one of the songs most associated with the 60's. The rest is all good too, very much a &quot;CSN&quot; and &quot;Byrds&quot; type of sound. One thing I always notice when I listen to this, is that the &quot;Neil Young&quot; songs are so strong, it just makes me want to listen to him. So I usually end up putting in some old &quot;Neil&quot; afterwards. This disc is in the same ballpark though, and all the tracks are enjoyable.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Once this album starts to play, if you're not hooked for the next hour or so you best move on to another genre.  I'm an avid listener of hip-hop, jazz and the occassional alternative group.  The reviews were so good I picked this up last week.  Its unbelievable. It was the best of Uncle Tupelo, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and Neil Young  - not to mention just pure original Wilco. I haven't heard a better album in at least 12 months. Fantastic.
B000060P79|3.0|Simple Plan is good but is by no means great. This band is pure pop and nothing else. I'm 15 and unlike most teens my age I actully know what punk is (Ramones,Minor Threat,Sex Pistols, Black Flag ect.). Punk is no longer a lifestyle or the way you think, it's an image which most people have these days. The musicianship is good, but could use some MAJOR improvement. The lyrics are at times extreamly corny (my alien), and looks like they could be written by an elementry school student. I know this band is trying to give kids something to relate to, but they could do just that with much better lyrics then they already have. Peirre's voice is extreamly high, and he does get kind of annoying after awhile. However if you are looking for an album that's fun to listen to then I suggest Simple Plan. If you are looking for something more though provoking then turn elsewhere.
B000001DTM|4.0|I'm sorry, but in my opinion this is NOT the greatest album of all time, not even close. It's not bad either, but I can't believe someone actually compared this to Led Zeppelin or the Beatles. No way! Mainly what makes this album so pleasing to listen to is the amazing production, courtesy of Eno and Lanios. \\"Zoo Station\\" wouldn't be nearly as interesting without those sound effects and slick production plastered all over it to cover up for the faulty songwriting. I still don't understand why they put that stinker right at the forefront. About half of the songs rely on the slick production values to acheive their gorgeous floating status, and i think they're REALLY good at this sort of thing (except on \\"Zoo Station\\", which just leaves a bad taste in my mouth) but it's one of the reasons i think this is one of the best-produced albums of all time, but not necesarilly the most well orchestrated musically. However, it's a good refreshing listen because the other half of the songs are well-written AND well-produced with some really impressive arrangments. So i'll proceed to throw a track-by-track review at ya...<br />Zoo Station: ugh, im sure you know by now i'm not fond of this song. The distorted whiny vocals, the lame songwriting, that annoying swishy sound effect...everything about it makes me cringe, because it sounds like the band just said, \\"Here we have a lame melody and bad lyrics, but no one will notice if we put all these 90's digital sound effects in the mix and distort the vocals so Bono sounds even more whiny than usual!\\"<br />Even Better Than the Real Thing: I really like this song. This is where the album really gets going. Great melody, beautiful solo (awesome guitar sound!), good lyrics...everything about this song rules. It's classic U2. <br />One: Another beauty. What an amazing ballad, with a certain emotional quality that can easily bring tears to someone's eyes. <br />Until the End of the World: Another goodie. Very well-arranged. I can definatlytell that U2 put a lot of thought into this song, because of the very detailed production that changes with each part of the song. <br />Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses: This one sounds like something off of the Joshua Tree with a new twist, which is to say, it's absolutely beautiful. Another meticulously crafted work of art. <br />So Cruel: What happened here?! I don't see anything special about this song. I mean, sure it's decent, and it sounds nice, but it just passes by without my even noticing. Nothing about it grabs me and pulls me in like the last few did.<br />The Fly: I have mixed feelings about this one. The production is amazing and the guitar sounds awesome, but the songwriting isn't up to par, in my opinion. See, it SOUNDS alright, but as far as songwriting goes, it seems like Eno and Lanios worked harder on the supercool 90's production than U2 worked on writing a decent melody. Sure it's good, but it could be a lot better!<br />Mysterious Ways: See \\"The Fly\\"...except I think this one has cooler noises in it, and those bongos rule.<br />Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World: Great song. I like it. great lyrics, decent melody, awesome atmosphere. It's quiet, introspective and subtle and the message of the song really hits home for a lot of people i think.<br />Ultraviolet: Baby Baby Baby light my waaay!! So catchy. Gotta love those guitar echo effects. Simple melody, but the detail of the production saves the day again, and we have another good-as-gold U2 song.<br />Acrobat: Dark! but good! both U2 and eno and lanios went out of their way here to portray a very detailed, heavy atmosphere throughout. as usual, good lyrics. Edge's guitar rocks out, Bono sounds great and the rhythm section is very tight in this one.<br />Love is Blindness: Ehh it's alright...That guitar solo sucks though! Sounds like he started playing and then accidentally dropped the guitar or something. The melody is fine, but damn this song could have been a LOT better.<br />Sothere you have it, a great album. Not the BEST OF ALL TIME by any stretch of imagination, but it's better than most of the junk you hear on the radio these days.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Two Towers is one of the best movies this year. Peter Jackson makes a huge jump of genres from horror now to action/adventure. This DVD includes many bonus features including interviews, tv spots, everything. Watch for Return of the King to come out December 17.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Being that Dark Side Of The Moon is my favorite album of all time, I was very excited to hear about the release of this DVD.  I absolutely love it.  This DVD tells the story of Dark Side of The Moon from it's creation, to it's aftermath with live performances, acoustic performances, early demos, music videos, rehearsal tapes, individual tracks from Alan Parsons mixing board(very cool), and in depth interviews with band members.  My only complaint is that they did not even mention one of my favorite instrumental tracks from the album entitled &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;.  Why it was forgotten in the DVD baffles me.   <br />The sound mix is not in 5.1, but it's one of the best stereo mixes i've ever heard.  Hearing Roger Waters explain what the song &quot;Time&quot; is about then hearing David Gilmores' amazing guitar solo was worth the money alone. Thank you Pink Floyd for releasing this DVD and making an album that changed my life! Don't hesitate, buy it now!
B00003CX5P|3.0|Thank you Mr. Lucas. I think most of us have been wondering, what ever happened before A New Hope? I think we can all agree that Star Wars is one of the best movies ever made. The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie but the classic originals are better. Attack of the Clones is better but still doesn't compare to the oringals.  This is the beginning. This is what we've been waiting for. The explanation of it all. Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a. Darth Vader) is just a young boy and is taught by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) to follow the Jedi ways. You have to watch this movie though. Watch for Episode III to hit theaters in May of 2005.
B00005JLZN|1.0|and certainly one of the most offensive. The very definition of ill-conceived, the Life of David Gale puts across a miserable view of humanity, managing to paint those on both sides of the death penalty issue as either redneck ingrates or morally bankrupt zealots. It's impossible for me to comprehend how Kevin Spacey, Kate Winslet and the other actors involved could have waded through this peurile script and deemed it worthy of their talents. Alan Parker horribly overdirects this obnoxious mess, practically every scene has some glaring detail that annoys. Characters butter rolls endlessly or stab at the air with oversize cigars, every once and awhile a quick montage of &quot;significant&quot; words will flash by onscreen. It's amazing that this is the same man who directed the fabulous neo-noir Angel Heart and several other worthy films. The Life of David Gale is an abomination, a shameful cinematic stinkpile that hangs a tacky thriller on the hook of an incredibly complex, quintessentially human issue. The last shot will make you want to throw your beverage of choice at the screen. Finally, something both sides of the death penalty debate can agree on.
B0000942HV|4.0|Think of this 2003 re-recording of the 30 year old Tubular Bells like your spouse of as many years with a new outfit; you'll remember what you love about it all over again. <BR>Now how about releasing that live version the Queen Elizabeth Hall in June 1973, with Mick Taylor, Steve Hillage, Fred Frith, Ted Speight, David Bedford, Kevin Ayers and Pierre Moerlen?!
B000002UA0|5.0|Most of the bad reviews I read on this site seem to come from people who haven't really given the album more than one half-hearted listen.  I had a pretty low opinion of the album myself until I gave it a decent chance - it really grows on you, especially if you aren't expecting to hear the DSOTM.
B000065U1N|4.0|This film meets all the criteria to make it great.  It has great special effects that both show the reality of the situation and also grip the viewer's attention.  The action scene is basically the latter 3 quarters of the movie, it doesn't let up, it just gets more intense.  The acting is second to none, all the actors do a great job (I go from what I see, not what I know of the actual situation).  All these features come together to make a truly awesome representation of what happened that dark day in Somalia.  This movie shows why Soldiers everywhere deserve respect.  These guys are out there in foreign lands protecting people they don't know, helping people they never met, trying to do what's right.  <br />What the movie lacks is information.  It doesn't tell us why US troops are in that area, it doesn't tell us what are causing the problems in that area.  It shows us lots scenes of starving people and lots of natives killing each other but it doesn't tell us why.  It's a typical Hollywood action/drama in that respect, American's like to see there troops on the big screen winning battles, it doesn't seem to matter what reasons for the battle are.  <br />The actual soldiers portrayed in the movie are done so with respect and accuracy.  People expect soldiers to be infallible, that they are programmed to fight and when conflict erupts around them it doesn't effect how they do there job.  This isn't the case with war, the explosions, the bullets ricocheting close to your head, this effects everyone, and how much is down to professionalism.  The US Army Rangers are some of the best regular infantry the US has, and that day they showed it.  Whether the mission is right or wrong, the soldiers do their job regardless.<br />4 Stars.
6305364648|2.0|I fail to see the logic in creating a DVD like this.  While it is in widescreen format, it is in standard 4:3 (1.33:1) rather than anamorphic (sized for 16:9 widescreen TVs).<br />This was one of my favorite movies.  The quality of the image on this DVD is passable.  I hope they release it in anamorphic format sometime in the near future for people that own more-current television sets so we can fully enjoy the technology we spent our hard-earned dollars on.<br />I was very pleased with the audio.  While it wasn't up to Superbit standards, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.
B0000AYL17|4.0|After Steely Dan had basically blown minds several times over since their debut album (perhaps missing the mind-blowing effect on \\"Pretzel Logic\\" and \\"Katy Lied\\", which are still both very strong and addictive albums), and especially after the jazz-meets-rock apex of \\"Aja\\", it seems almost impossible that Messrs. Becker and Fagan could have upped the ante any more. <br />The legend has it that both were burnt out after \\"Aja\\", but nonetheless, there's a lot of stuff that resonates throughout \\"Gaucho\\", to the point of being a remarkable album still. Surprises include the choice of (Dire Straits leader) Mark Knopfler as solo guitarist for \\"Time Out of Mind\\", but one listen to the track and it's a given that Knopfler's feel was exactly what it took for this song. The only weak points are perhaps the last quarter of the album, \\"My Rival\\" and \\"Third World Man\\" (which are still quite interesting). However, my sole gripe is that the world never did get to hear a recorded version of \\"The Second Arrangement\\", the track originally set to close the album, and supposedly the best of the lot. (If that's the case, then why did the band never attempt it again, either solo or on more recent albums? Are bootlegs available?).<br />Most everything else released afterwards seems more connected to \\"Gaucho\\" than any other Steely Dan album, but maybe that's because the Dan never attempted to ignite the stylus afterwards, quite content to play \\"in the pocket\\". You won't hear any complaints from me...<br />In fact, \\"Everything Must Go\\", their latest effort, draws many comparisons to \\"Gaucho\\". This should be seen as a good thing (although I'd be quick to say that arrangements are not as elaborate on EMG as it is on this one). Although it pales in comparison to \\"Aja\\", it's still a very stellar effort whose greatest reason for not having five stars is simply the consistently high degree of quality from Steely Dan throughout the '70s. Pick it up if you haven't already. That is, if you're a Steely Dan fan.
B00004SVID|3.0|There's always been two unspoken camps among Pink Floyd fans. The first swear by 1973's Dark Side of the Moon; an unequalled headphone album of cosmic concepts protesting humanity's weaknesses with a soft brush of lush sax solos, pensive guitar noodling and soulful female backup singers. The second camp were weaned on The Wall, the 1979 double concept album that sounds exactly like what it is: a hallucinogenic exorcism for Roger Water's disillusionment with being a rock star and detachment from the audience by way of a blitzkreig of stomping Fourth Reich themes, horror show imagery, grim acoustic alienation and seques of nighmarish sound effects and skits. So 20 years on it's a bit of surprise to report that it's the first camp of Floyd fans who will probably enjoy this 2  disc live set the most. The reason is simple: unlike the original studio album, which felt as clinically cold as something assembled by suicidal robots, Is Anybody Out There? (recorded during a pair of shows at Earl's Court in London during the 1980-81 tour)transforms the entire album in to a work as colourful and textured as Dark Side. The recording quality is superb and although the band's improvisation was limited by the complex stage set (a crumbling brick wall strung with puppets, peekaboo sets, hydraulics and effects) and prerecorded seques straight off the album, the songs breathe a new life here thanks to several moments of alternative musical reconstruction. Whereas the original album was one long dash of icy bleakness with odd moments of acoustic grace, Is Anybody Out There? takes the same collection of songs and blushes them with warm nuances at appropriate moments, adding a new sense of intrigue to the story of the doomed rock star who bricks himself in with an imaginary wall constructed to protect himself from life's traumas. This balance, which seemed to be missing from the original - plus two never-before-released instrumental tracks (What Shall We Do Now and The Last Few Bricks) and a pair of thick booklets of colour photos from the original show to fill in the blanks -ultimately makes The Wall a more inviting - and fascinating -trip more than 20 years after the fact.
0385504209|3.0|As someone once said, &quot;Everyone loves a conspiracy theory.&quot; Brown doesn't disappoint and resurrects (pun intended) a bit of Gnosticism, which has been around for millenia. The theory goes something like this: The Catholic Church has suppressed the &quot;truth&quot; about Jesus Christ, who was merely human and married Mary Magdalene, who bore his children. According to The Davinci Code, the Catholic Church, in all its misogynistic glory, has deliberately suppressed this information for thousands of years. Like Mark Furman and the L.A. police force's collusion that resulted in the framing of OJ Simpson, the Catholic Church has engaged in an extensive conspiracy for millenia to prevent the faithful from learning the &quot;truth&quot; about Jesus Christ. Despite the obvious shortcomings of the &quot;theory,&quot; the book's a great romp and a real page-turner. Beware of the ending, however, since it's so sweet you may lapse into a diabetic coma.
0385335482|5.0|This book is hilarious!  This was the first time I had read any of Sophie Kinsella's work and I have already ordered the two sequels!  The chrachter Becky Bloomwood lives in a world all her own - we all deserve Gucci, Tiffany's and more right? Only a small thing like PAYING for it stops us.  No more!  Becky has it all figured out, not! This book is worth the price just to read the letters to her banker!
B00005JKZU|1.0|I remember reading the Tolken books about 25 years ago, and I recall at the time I found them very entertaining.  So why do I find both movie renditions so boring?<br />True, it's been 25 years or so since I read the books and I'm sure my tastes have changed, but I don't remember the books being mostly about war.  I don't remember trying to figure out how Frodo could one minute be following Gollum and the next Gollum is nowhere in sight.  <br />My suspicion is that the makers of the film are too caught up in the computer generated special effects and have forgotten that what makes a good movie is a good story.  Gollum is pretty good, but he does look like he could be a close cousin of Dobby the house elf out of Harry Potter.  The rest of the special effects seemed unbelievable.  The marching hordes had no real detail and appeared fuzzy to me.  The battle scenes had the same problem.  The figures of the non-humans always seemed to be moving just a little too fast for the \\"camera\\" to catch the details.<br />I have a further suspicion that the director was so interested in his special effects, that he forgot to try and get decent performances out of the actors and actresses involved in the project or to care about totally lame dialogue.  And by the end of the movie, I thought if Sam said \\"Mr. Frodo\\" one more time, I would scream!<br />The film makers are so interested in showing us zillions of beasties marching on what's left of civilization that they forget the need to deliver a coherent plot.  They are so interested in making nifty computer generated tree people that they've forgotten that not everyone has read the book within the last 3 months and it would be nice if they developed the people and the plot well enough for those of us who are not immersed in the \\"Ring\\" culture to be able to follow and perhaps enjoy the movie.
B000068PQ0|4.0|If there were ever such a thing as Cliff's Notes for Rock and Roll, Yoshimi would be it for The Floyds Wall.  Not as cryptic, but equally as mystic, Yoshimi can really let your imagination take you out of this world. On the surface it's a complete tribute to pop culture, but underneath it's a simple album that lets you know that you're not alone if you think &quot;you're the only one that knows&quot;.  <br />And I just tried to sound like a Rolling Stone critic. How'd I do?<br />And I gave it a 4 just because that makes me sound like I know what the difference between 4 and 5 is.

B000031XCR|4.0|This Album is a pretty decent \\"Best of\\" CD. However, some good songs are missing. Mislead (a very upbeat, dance number) and Where Does my Heart Beat Now, and Tell Him, the duet with Babs. Still, it is worth having. Hopefully, Sony will release a Celine greatest hits with all her Hits soon.
B0000A02TZ|2.0|The extras on this disk are laughable.  By that, I don't mean that you'll laugh at them. The &quot;Reunion&quot; video is 20+ minutes of unscripted bore--the music video is pointless (and there, why, exactly?) The documentary is okay, but you've probably seen it on TV.<br />The movie is, as always, very funny.  But I bought it the first time, didn't you?  And I fall into line right behind the people who hate the &quot;locked-in&quot; previews.  Why should I pay for a disk that forces advertisement down my throat?  I hate this trend at the movie theatre, too.  Perhaps Universal would like to send me a check every time I watch their ad on my disk.
076790592X|5.0|This is a profoundly moving real-life story about a dying, college professor who had made the commitment to be his best regardless of the circumstances. As he became increasingly debilitated, he did not waiver from this commitment. His every word and action expressed a noble purpose.  I loved this book and recommend Optimal Thinking: How to be Your Best Self by Dr. Rosalene Glickman to provide you and your loved ones with the mental resource to be your best in any and every situation.
B00005JLSE|5.0|What a fine film, truly deserving of all its accolades.
0060976624|4.0|Only Christopher Buckley could findd the humor in being a corporate PR representative for the tobacco companies.

B00005JKZV|5.0|I tried so hard to hold out for the Extended Edition release in November, but just couldn't wait that long to watch this movie a few times, so I went ahead and bought this.  This movie is just as wonderful as the first film, with only one difference:  The first film focused on all of Tolkien's characters and lots of history.  This film mainly focuses on humans. While \\"Two Towers\\" does stray a little from the original books, those strays do not distract or disturb the story in any way.  For instance, the elves never came to Helms Deep to help mankind in the big battle... but that sequence offered a wonderful sense of hope and is a favorite scene in many people's eyes who have not read the books.  I didn't mind the strays at all... in fact, I would rather the movies NOT follow the original story to a \\"T\\" because then no one would want to read the books to find out what really happened.  <br />I won't go into what the movie is about because I think just about everyone in the entire world has seen this movie and there are hundreds of reviews here to tell you the story.  But, what I will focus on is the DVD extras.  Included is some short cast interviews about the Two Towers and the making of it.  There is a big teaser about the 43-minutes of extra footing that will be in the Extended DVD release and I can't wait to see it.  There were many Treebeard scenes that were cut out and many very interesting plot points.  They seem so pivotal to the story that I can only imagine the reason they were cut was because they didn't want us sitting in the theater for 4 hours!  There is also 12 minutes or so of what to expect from \\"Return of the King\\", which will not at all spoil anything, but does offer a general background of what events will take place.  If you're looking for glimpses of Shelob the spider or Sauron's physical form, you will not find it at all here.  But, like I said, they do give you a few clips to look at and a general discussion of what takes place.  Most people enjoyed the Helm's Deep battle, but this upcoming battle in the last movie dwarfs Helm's Deep!!<br />Is this DVD worth buying or should you hold out for the Extended DVD in November 2003?  Well, I couldn't wait that long.  I love this movie and it is a movie I can watch over and over.  The extras are not 5-star material, but they are ok - best being the sneak peak of the next movie and clips of extra scenes that will be added to the DVD release in November.  If you can hold out for the extended edition, I would.  But, if you are a 'freak of a fan' like I am of these movies, you won't mind buying both!  But, I don't mind over-supporting excellent movies such as these... they don't come around very often!
B00008X5J3|5.0|All this talk about comparing Chicago to this and that musical is giving me a headache.  The fact of the matter is, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  It had a cynical, almost sarcastic look at the American justice system, which I think rings close to home especially after the O.J. Simpson trial.  It also showed how fickle the American public can be concerning celebrities...one moment they are hot, then a second later, the public can turn against you.  If anything, this movie gives a somewhat exaggerated, but nonetheless accurate view of America.  While some people may feel this is overglorifying people who get away with murder, the reality is that's what happens sometimes.  As far as which movie &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; was &quot;better&quot;...I don't think you can really compare the two.  Each had its' own special moments...and each person will enjoy it in different ways.  For me, however, I say buy them both (but I'm going to buy &quot;Chicago&quot; first).
B000026LUB|5.0|My mother let me listen to this recording when I was visiting her in Ontario. I felt slightly embarrassed when the tears fell from my eyes as the music completely moved me. This is truly my favorite c.d. of its type. When I need uplifting or beautiful music to read to or just pause in my busy day ,I place Adiemus in the stereo and get inspired by the gorgeous vocal and instumental sounds.
B0000027I6|4.0|I remember first hearing this 11 years ago, and being so pleased at how good this album was- and at how good Roger Waters' material still could be. <br />OK, this is not everyone's cup of tea. Certainly the reaction of some critics was less than effusive. 'Yet another doom laden LP' was a typical comment. And although I'm glad he's doing what he's doing, sometimes I do wish he'd lighten up a bit every now and then. The good news, though, is that this set contains some great songs, and has the feel of a Pink Floyd concept album without being a pale copy. Waters' love of the blues is comes through here (he was always responsibile for the bluesier part of the Floyd repertoire), especially since he has Jeff Beck play some amazing lead guitar. As usual, the songs are linked by an almost cinematic soundtrack of background sound. The first part has more concise rock songs, the highlights being 'What God Wants Part 1&quot;, 'Perfect Sense Part 2', and 'The Bravery of Being Out of Range'. Then we have 'What God Wants Part 3', which still sends shivers down my spine, especially that Beck guitar solo, followed by Waters yelling 'Christ it's freezing outside, the veteran cried&quot;. It also starts off with the same piano 'ping!' that started off Floyd classic 'Echoes', before Waters sings &quot;Don't be afraid/It's only business&quot;- a not-at-all subtle dig at his former collegues, but then Waters has never been known for his subtlety. Towards the end, the songd get longer, more droning and more atmospheric- Floyd fans will probably like it, those insisting on concise, to-the-point songs will not.<br />Waters does have a tendancy to put things on his albums that are there to advance the 'concept' of the album, which are too wordy and add too little of musical value. In my view, 'Late Home Tonight' Parts 1 and 2 are in that category. Another complaint- Waters (never much of a singer) does not sing so much as croak. I had thought this was because he was getting older, but in fact he would sing some of these songs much better seven years later when he performed them live. Sometimes, though, his vocal limitations do create a certain something that helps the song. For instance, on 'What God Wants, Part 1&quot;, he sounds like an old prophet warning of death and destruction- which is rather fitting.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre three times and since I received the DVD last week, I've watched that three times.  This movie is genuine entertainment; you won't want to blink in case you miss something.  &quot;Chicago&quot; is funny, sassy, colorful, and features some of the most talented people in movies today.  I've heard some say they haven't seen this movie because they &quot;don't like musicals!&quot;  If you have the same excuse for not seeing Chicago, it's your loss. Excuse me, I have to go now and watch the DVD again!!
B00006X06U|1.0|I am having a difficult time enjoying Travelogue. Here was an opportunity for Joni to breath new life into her past body of work, but instead she has created a very morose and maudlin affair that has induced serious yawning and boredom.Since about 1994, there has been a campaign going to convince the public that Joni Mitchell is a genius, a misunderstood artist whose work, like that of Van Gough, will only be appreciated after her passing. Like with previous recordings, on Travelogue,  I've valiantly tried to convince myself of her genius, to really see into the music, but I just don't buy it. I'm tired of digging for buried treasure, when there probably isn't any to find.  A seriously overrated artist who fills the niche for people wanting to believe they are listening to inspired music. Sammy Davis Jr. is more inspired than Joni mitchell

0486424510|5.0|This is a book worth reading many times.  I pick it up every couple of years and enjoy it more and more every time.  Collins mocks and sympathizes with his characters at the same time.  The mystery is fun.  The plot is a bit slow.  The characters make the book well worth the time.  They are like old friends with all of the forgivable faults and quirks that mark the best of friends.

B00005ASGG|5.0|Shinbone is a sleepy little &quot;one cow town&quot; until all heck breaks loose on the trail outside town.  The local bully and criminal, who has the whole town scared out of their wits, hold up the Overland Stage with several of his hoodlum buddies.  Should have been a routine job but there is a young lawyer among the passengers who vows to clean up the territory...and without a gun!  The bully and the lawyer face off in a variety of ways that ultimately lead to the classic western showdown.  But the question remains right up until the movie's climax: who shot Liberty Valance?<br />Don't worry this John Ford classic western has plenty of fist fights and fast guns to appeal to any devout western movie lover but adds a story and script that will have those who normally don't take in westerns coming back again and again.  <br />Beautifully shot and featured in its original black and white, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance features one of the greatest casts ever assembled under any movie title.  John Wayne stars as Tom Doniphon with a supporting cast including Jimmy Stewart as Ransom Stoddard, Vera Miles (The Searchers, Follow Me Boys) as Hallie Stoddard, Edmond O'Brien (The Wild Bunch) as Dutton Peabody, Andy Devine (A frequent vocal performer in Disney animated features) as Marshal Link Appleyard, John Carradine (The Shootist--and the patriarch of the famed Carradine clan including David, Keith and Robert) as Maj. Cassius Starbuckle, Strother Martin (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) as Floyd, Lee Van Cleef (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, in one of his earliest roles) as Reese, Denver Pyle (Cahill, US Marshall) as Amos Carruthers and Lee Marvin, in one of his greatest roles ever, as  Liberty Valance.
B0000029LG|5.0|Considering this is the most expensive album ever recorded,<BR>Michael makes it one for the Guiness Book Of Records!This two-<BR>disk whopper starts with a CD of well-remastered greatest hits,<BR>some of the greatest music recorded in it's time and mostly<BR>featuring the superb production of Quincy Jones.But the next disk<BR>of all new songs is an ENTIRELY different animal.All of MJ's new<BR>music in 1995 was angry,bitter and hard edged as he bluntly<BR>demanded to be left alone in &quot;Scream&quot;,asking to &quot;stop pressuring<BR>me&quot;,losing hope of the biting &quot;They Don't Care About Us&quot; and<BR>the vital &quot;Earth Song&quot; and scarring us half to death with the<BR>highly morbid &quot;Little Susie&quot;-pretty charged-up stuff.Considering<BR>his still very new child abuse allegations this level of bitterness seems appropriate.It's on a par with John Lennon's<BR>&quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; or Marvin Gayes &quot;Here,My Dear&quot; in emmotional<BR>scope and while musically it isn't exactly perfect it does have<BR>many,many moments.Worth it!
B000068IEU|5.0|By the time you read this review I am sure you will know the basic story line, the flawed attempts at comic relief, and the fact that the acting truly isn't award winning.  Yet,in my opinion, to really understand the intention and direction of this film you'll need to let all of that go and and allow yourself to somehow relate to the two teenaged female victims with abandoned empathy.  Look at them as your daughter and her friend; you and your friend talking each other into making a stupid decision; or fill in the blank with other females in your life as needed- neices, your students, etc.<br />In the 70's it was just that easy to get caught up in trusting people you should never trust under any circumstances. Girls hitch-hiked regularly, people bought pot off of strangers, nearly everyone was viewed as a potential friend, and not as an enemy, as we do today. And that's where the real fear lies in the film.  Yes, it really could have happened, and yes, people can be that twisted, desperate, and deranged.<br />I saw it only once, in the theatre, when it was originally released,and I can easily replay the scenes that take place in the woods over in my mind, because that's how deep of an impression they left on me. The begging, the laughing, the humiliation, the torture, it was disturbing because I or any of my young friends could have fallen victim to the entire premise.  Now that's what I call scary.<br />If you're looking for the slickness of Silence of the Lambs, forget it.  But, if you're ready for gritty, flawed, realistic, frightening, disturbing, dirty, film making, you came to the right house.  Or should I say Left House.......

B000006YL5|4.0|A late concept album that features some great individual songs - &quot;Hole Hearted,&quot; &quot;Get the Funk Out,&quot; and &quot;More Than Words.&quot;  Heavier than the most well known of the songs - &quot;More Than Words,&quot; but melodic with beautiful guitar work and soaring vocals.
0553106635|5.0|George R. R. Martin scares me. Ever time I read his books I am sure there is no possible way for a human being to have written them. They have too many subplots, but yet stay focused, too many characters, but doesn't stray. All in all, it seems to real to be true. I read the first book and thought, 'This certainly can't continue at this level.' I was right, each consecutive novel has surpassed the other, amazingly enough. My words may seem a bit strong, perhaps exaggerated, but they aren't, you must read it to be able to understand.

0385512104|5.0|Reading or watching a movie about an autistic person is one thing. Getting into their mind and experiencing events through their eyes is something totally different. The heart-wrenching part of this book is that you get to see the world through Christophers eyes, but you as the reader know how to react to emotions but do not see that happening. So, when events happen that you would expect the narrator to react to don't happen, you are left in an odd zone. Every reaction in Christophers' actions is calculated and serves a purpose, it isn't his nature to &quot;fly of the handle&quot; when something happens. He reacts in a specific way for specific reasons. <br />At first glance it might appear that the book is fairly simplistic and far too amature to warrant the time to read it. Devoid of flowing descriptions and whimsical musings, everything in here is matter of fact<BR>&quot;I started with the dog because it happened to me and I find it hard to imagine things which did not happen to me.&quot;.<br />It might put off some readers, again as appearing simplistic, but when you realize that this isn't a simplistic mind writing these events, you can grow to understand and feel his world. I think this is a must read for those interested in what type of world autistic individuals live in and how they function. A beautiful story and I enjoyed reading each chapter, which by the way are not numbered 1,2,3 but I'll let Christopher explain:<BR>&quot;Chapters in books are usually given the cardinal numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 and so on. But I have decided to give my chapters prime numbers 2,3,5,7,11,13 and so on becuase I like prime numbers.
0066214122|5.0|It's a work of Crichton and I love it. It's fun reading and I love his work for that. I don't want to read novels that make me think about myself and feel bad or make me want to improve my inner character. There are self-help books out there designed for that.<br />What I want is fun reading that's beleivable, not necessarily absolutely and without flaw beleivable.<br />I'm a techie myself and I found his explanations close to the real thing, if not right on the dot. His introduction was a good way to set the mood.<br />I don't know why the othe reviewers complained about the plot, or the language, or the this and that. It's a story and it was written with fun and excitement in mind. Go read it now!
B000002UB3|5.0|beatles: Great band with smart lyrics and great riffs and great skills. This is the best beatles album. Well i think so.
B00008S2VG|4.0|after the worldwide smash that was 'music',madonna chose to go in a different direction with 'american life'. interesting,considering both albums were co-produced by mirwais,the french studio wizard who reminds one of other big french acts such as daft punk and cassius. 'american life' goes in a darker,more personal direction than 'music',and it's all the better for it. where 'music' seemed to creatively and sonically jump around from sci-fi funk to vocodered retro pop to cowgirl dance ditties with varying degrees of success,'american life' is thoroughly consistent while still offering a variety of sounds and textures. the best here to me is the southern fried electro rock of 'i'm so stupid',the funky and futuristic 'nobody knows me' and the pure acoustic pop of 'hollywood'. <BR> thematically 'american life' is strong,with madonna ruminating melodically on the perils of fame. oftentimes the album can be very dark,such as on 'mother and father',a song about the death of madonna's mother and madonna's resolution to give up her pain and finally move on with her life. <BR> if you like intelligent pop then this is the album for you. if,however,you're wanting feel-good upbeat dance ditties about nothing in paticular then you should look elsewhere. the bottom line is this may not be madonna's best,but it certainly isn't bad in any way.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I bought this DVD right it came out, and was not disappointed. This behind the making-of documentary is facinating, with excellent interviews, rare archival footage and Alan Parsons and David Gilmore sitting at the mixing board expaining how this landmark album was put together is a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan.
0792838068|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this is one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen.  Don't buy this thinking it will reward you with an uplifting experience by the end of the film.  <br />That being said, Leaving Las Vegas truly is a fantastic movie.  It is a sad tale of a man with nothing to lose going on a suicidal drinking binge in Las Vegas.  I saw this film almost immediately after Con Air, in which Nicholas Cage's acting is underwhelming to say the least.  Before seeing Leaving Las Vegas, I already had a closed mind about Nicholas Cage's talent; to be truthful I thought he was only famous because his uncle directed the Godfather.  Even though he will of course never read this review, I feel I must apologize for ever thinking such a thing.<br />Nicholas Cage was absolutely incredible in this film.  Throughout the entire movie his character was drunk and Cage portrayed this character with as much talent as the world's best actors.  Leaving Las Vegas is by far his best movie.
B000000W5L|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet.  The band that recorded this masterpiece had definitely been working out the musical kinks on the road before they went to France.  The Stones kick ass out of the starting gate!<br />This album was not recorded by a mere British rock 'n' roll quintet.  The Stones, in 1971, were really a modern version of the good, old Ike Turner or Johnny Otis Revues of the '50's and '60's.  What you were dealing with was an eight-piece r&b band complete with sax, trumpet, and keyboards.  \\"Exile\\" was a showcase for this road-tested congregation to explore every style of music that ever influenced the Rolling Stones.<br />Because of the muddy mix on the original pressing of this album, lyrics would have been welcome.  \\"Exile\\" has some of the best lyrics the Stones ever wrote.  At their best, they're like a combination of Dylan, Burroughs, and Willie Dixon.  It would've been sweet if they had done something similar to what the Beatles did with the \\"White Album\\"- an insert that folds out to reveal a poster on one side and lyrics on the other. <br />Listen to \\"Exile\\" with the fascination of an onlooker who witnessed the Hindenberg disaster back in 1938.  \\"Exile\\" blazes with a devilish fire.  Sadly, you realize that within a short period of time the fire will die and you'll be left with ashes.  \\"Goat's Head Soup,\\" the follow-up album to \\"Exile,\\" will leave you disappointed.  \\"Exile\\" is like the euphoric rush you get when you partake of a narcotic.  \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" is the aftermath which leaves you lethargic and ready to nod out.
0800130928|5.0|For all those that have ever insulted Robert De Niro's talent, watch Taxi Driver to see why so many consider Robert De Niro to be the best actor alive.  Taxi Driver is one of the most unique films of all time.  <br />It is a 2 hour character study, but despite this rather boring idea, the film is pulled off expertly by filmmaking genius Martin Scorsese.  During the whole movie, I asked myself, if I were in Travis' situation, who's to say I wouldn't lash out at all of these scummy people I dealt with everyday?  Travis did lose his mind towards the end, but nevertheless he comes out as a hero even though he is a severely disturbed mind.  <br />De Niro's performance in this movie is simply incredible and still unmatched by any actor alive.  This film should be mandatory viewing for every moviegoer alive.

B0000004V2|5.0|9am on a sunday morning in the early nineties. You get back to London after an intense 3 hour drive back from a free party in an anonymous field in Somerset. 36 hours on the go - time to chill out, take things down a notch or two. everyone flops down, tries to crash. then someone puts the stone roses album on the decks. you try to fight it, settle further into the sofa. Then the music takes hold. Looking around, people are stirring. I wanna... i wanna... i wanna be adored. Whooshbangboom. You're off again.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Not quite as good as I had hoped.  But, better than nothing!
B00009MEJU|1.0|Many reviews of this move start with &quot;If you are epecting....&quot; you won't like this movie.  And positive authors will add that if you are expecting it to be &quot;like the novel&quot; or &quot;A NORMAL sc-fi movie&quot; or &quot;movie that doesn't make you think.....&quot; you won't like it.<br /> Most of the positive reviews insult the viewer who does not &quot;get&quot; this movie because it is so deep that if you are of average intelligence, you are just not smart enough to understand.<br />HOGWASH--- When ask to explain what happen-- they can't.  The probably couldn't stay awake and to hide their embarassment, make up some stupid lie.<br />1. This movie is first and foremost boring.<br />2.It does not make any sence, this maybe intentional, but that does not make it a good movie, or even a thought provoking one.<br />3. The movie is still boring  (I know this is a repeat, but reading some of the reviews I first thought I must have watch a different movie from everyone else.  But read what they wrote....they speak vaugly and with many different opinions on what actually happens, which is fine to some degree.  But in this movie it is because the scipt does not make any sense.)<br />Watch the movie if you like, and try to answer these quesitons:<br />1.  Why does the company send a lone therpist into a know crisis situation?<br />2. Who pilots the aircraft getting him there?<br />3. Why does the company pay from him to be transported, they've already lost a military transport and now they're going to send in a lone civilian?<br />4. Why does he not try and make radio contact with them before boarding the ship?<br />5. Who is the little boy?<br />This question will not help you to enjoy the movie, but atleast give you something to do during the painfully borning movie.
B0000549B2|5.0|The music clearly is the star of this film. Mixing avant garde jazz with more standard fare and doing it successfully. You love music, you love this film. The film itself is worth watching too. The usual expert and hardworking performance from the very photogenic Denzel Washington.  Cynda Williams is so sexy I wouldn't care if she couldn't act (but she is a competent actress). Spike Lee (properly speaking, his long-time cinematographer Ernest Dickerson) is an artist and the way he photographs his scenes is always a pleasure. This is a better story than some of his other films. Don't see how a real lover of cinema could hate this movie.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty is amazing. There is just no stopping him on this record. I must say that I am a big metalhead, but that is not all I ever listen to. This album is simply fabulous, from those telltale acoustic intro chords on &quot;Free Falling&quot; to the absolutely genial lyrics of &quot;Zombie Zoo&quot;. If you like rock and roll, I definetely would recommend picking it up. You will NOT be sad that you did so.
B00005JLTN|5.0|Most people are reluctant to give Reloaded the credit that it most definately deserves.  The first viewing is mildly confusing, but not so much as its predecessor.  The Matrix Reloaded is an excellent film, much better than most people expect.  This film in no way lets down fans.  It ends on an incredible cliffhanger, though.  I highly reccomend this film to anyone who has seen and enjoyed The Matrix.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Now this is a Farewell Tour I have been looking forward to for years.  And archived for posterity!  What a treat!!  Highly recommended for whenever you need a little cheering up. HHD.
B00003CXCK|5.0|You can watch this movie a hundred times and find a new aspect of history and depth every time you watched, and when you find something new in it you think, \\"how could I have missed that before\\".  Its a history lesson, a life lesson, and should be required viewing to all people children and adults so that no one forgets.
B00007LTIB|5.0|When I was about fifteen years old, my friend gave me a tape with a bunch of music he liked on it, that his old college roommate made for him. One of the songs on the tape was \\"Sound Chaser\\", but there was no documentation of this. I was blown away by the beauty and virtuosity of this song. It took years for me to finally realise that it was Yes I had been listening to. Thus began my transformation into a Yes fanatic. <BR>Relayer is my second favorite record (second to Close To The Edge) in the world. <BR>When this new repackaging came out, I was appalled to see that Atlantic had actually tried to cut up these epics into singles. That didn't work for Close To The Edge, and it doesn't really work here. However, it was quite gracious of Rhino to include all this bonus material on the reissues. So I am now, of course, collecting all of them just for the bonus tracks. Thank you, Atlantic and Rhino, for satisfying a lot of Yes freaks like me.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Well, what can I say that hasn't been said already? Awesome flick based on an awesome trilogy. More violent than the first installment, but the graphics are awesome - Gollum comes to life! I can't wait until December to see how they do with the third installment. Word on the set was that Return of The King is essentially saving the best for last. The battle for Helms Deep is one of the best action sequences I have ever seen in any movie. I read the books over 25 years ago and everything came to life. The Ents are truly awesome. Walking trees that actually look cool while walking? It doesn't get any better!
B0000648WZ|5.0|Ok to begin with...This is probably the best movie I have ever seen and Im not exactly a Sci-Fi person either.This is a very serious movie and not one I like to call funny.The war-like violence is very intence,and I DO NOT recommend this for younger viewers.The Special Effects are the best Ive seen yet...even almost equal to the Newer series of Star Wars.100's of years have passed and humans are starting to evolve with phychic capabilities and the human population is nearly 4x what it is now.A hostile planet inhabited by hostile bugs are hurling meteors at Earth.A single Democratic Goverment commanding over earth are willing to send millions into command...I wish i could say more but there is a limit to what i can say...Please check this movie out for it may be one of the best youve seen yet!
0553579908|5.0|The first book, &quot;A Game if Thrones,&quot; is absoulutely stunning and masterfully imagined. It concluded with a grand finale, but nothing resolved, and only more chaos to come. <br />Lots of events take place and it ends with a real &quot;clash,&quot; so I won't spoil anything here. <br />Now, unlike most fantasy novels, this series lacks magic the way we think of it: wizards, dark lords, heroes etc. Sorcery is demonstrated subtly and mysteriously. In one interview, Martin said: &quot;Gandalf is a wizard, but what does he actually do that's magical? He makes fireworks that may or may not be magical, his staff glows, but you don't see him, as in some of the bad fantasies, with magic treated almost as a superpower from a comic book, where the characters are going around throwing fireballs and they have a lot of spells. Tolkien was much more mysterious. Sauron never comes on stage, you never know what his actual powers are except that they're vast and malignant. The whole handling of magic is very subtle. When I realized what Tolkien had done there, it seemed to me that he had made a great choice. The whole point about magic is that it has to be magical.&quot; <BR>Where other series, namely &quot;Wheel of Time,&quot; use magic like some cheap theatrics in a video game. In &quot;A Clash of Kings,&quot; however, you can pick up on some really mysterious magic, like dragons, wildfire, assasins, etc.<br />Now political intrigue comes onto the stage here. Very Machiavellian and trust is only an illusion. This is protrayed very well by Tyrion's chapters. <br />There are two new and very interesting characters introduced in this book. So you must certainly read this book. But by all means, read &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; first, if your new to the series. Its the best 1st-book in any series. Ever. And the second just gets better.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Ok,This Isnt bad movie at all.If you enjoy horror Thrillers like Blade then you will enjoy this one.Full of good special effects and music and actually a well balanced storyline.Full of nightmaric creatures such as Zombies and Hellish Dogs and even a top-secret creature known as a Licker in the video game.If your not into Horror Thrillers this may not be a movie for you...but if you are this is a great movie that I myself think could be better but good enough to earn my support! Please check this movie out! and if you have played the game seriers definantly check it out If you have'nt already!  I Give this one 4 and 1/4 stars.
B00009RGBS|5.0|I must admit, I was skeptical about seeing this movie, having seen the play on Broadway and really loved it.  Screen adaptations of plays are often a dicey proposition, much like the screen adaptation of a favorite book, the formats don't always jive and important details are often dropped...in the force-fitting process.  This is not the case with Chicago.  Not only is this a faithful adaptation of the story, it's a faithful adaptation of the music, the dance and the characters all the way through. The performances are brilliant and the essence of the beloved play is maintained amazingly well.  A must see!
B00005U1YO|4.0|A soft, smooth journey into some good sounds.  Very solid, complete, intelligent, blended production.  After a few listens, you'll be addicted.  Relax or get active--this CD gives you both worlds. In other reviews, people bring up a previous CD--DIG YOUR OWN HOLE.  I found that CD to be &quot;OK&quot; but somewhat obnoxious with too much bass. HOLE was made for a teenage ear.
B00000JGHM|5.0|It takes a truly brilliant movie to successfully trespass outside the boundaries of its genre.  Heat is such a movie: ostensibly a cops and robbers film, but although the holdup scenes are terrific and the action is beautifully paced, this film isn't really about the cop trying to catch the criminal.  As its title suggests, it's really a look into the deep sacrifice and soul-killing required to be a policeman or a criminal, how these are not professional choices but lifestyle choices and how the presence of the heat controls everything for both sides.<br />Nothing needs to be said about Pacino and De Niro; this is some of the best acting either of them have ever done, and we all know that's saying A LOT.  Val Kilmer takes what could have been a forgettable character and injects him with some real angst.  Ashley Judd is always good in everything, even the trash she's been making lately.  There are myriad supporting characters in a film of this scale and there's not a wrong note among them.  In a three-hour film, not once do you hear a character utter a line and feel the believability slip.  The script is tight and excellent; no cliches here, and none of the hackneyed sentiment that seems to be a requirement for action films these days.<br />Michael Mann is one of the great underappreciated filmmakers of our time.  I guess it doesn't help that he got his start on Miami Vice, but if you go back and watch it, even Miami Vice shows flashes of Mann's brilliant visual style and ability to use the non-sentimental to tug at your heartstrings.  Manhunter and The Last of the Mohicans are just as uniformly excellent as Heat but I think they lacked the focus that Heat has; they're great stories, not explorations of men's souls.  Here Mann has brought together all elements needed in a great film (the cinematography is another incredibly underappreciated element - the sprawling urban landscape is gritty and yet somehow beautiful under the camera) and the result is a perfect creation without a single wrong note.  The end has been somewhat maligned; I suppose it tests the tolerance of the typical action film afficionado, but as said before, it's a film that's basically about two men; all the rest is scenery though brilliantly done.  I doubt he'll ever do anything this perfect again.  The Insider was wonderful and I found Ali pretty enjoyable, but I think he may have topped out here, all elements coming together in perfect proportion.  I can't recommend this strongly enough.
0380789019|5.0|Gaiman's &quot;Neverwhere&quot; is a great story about a kind but odd man, Richard, whose life is changed forever when he decides to help an injured young lady named Door. From that point forward, his life begins to unravel, and he is introduced to an underground world beneath London with its own rules and a group of unforgetable (and sometimes dangerous) characters. While on a mission to learn why Door's family was murdered, Richard still longs for home, for his job, and his fiancee.<br />Gaiman's writing is elegant, occasionally humorous, and his characters are well developed (with exception of a few minor characters that could have been excluded entirely) especially Richard, Door and the assasins Vandemar and Croup. Wonderful storytelling and highly recommended!<br />(If you loved &quot;Neverwhere,&quot; I also recommend Edward Carey's &quot;Observatory Mansions.&quot;)
B000001GRZ|3.0|Pierre Fournier's own interpretation of the unaccompanied cello suites really put me to sleep. Okay, he may be one of the greatest cellists in this generation, but I could care less about this album.  Mr. Fournier plays everything slurred, legato, and very metronomic with little or no dynamic contrast.  He literally kills the whole idea behind the Bach suites.  If you're looking for a more Baroque approach to the unacccompanied suites, don't bother purchasing this album.
B00008LOS1|5.0|My 5-star rating is not based on what this could have been, or alongside the fact of the previous remaster, but on its own terms as what it IS.  From this angle, I don't know what's not to love about this Deluxe Edition.  We all know that Who's Next rocks, and now we get the complete (?) Record Plant Session along with the lion's share of a Young Vic performance in superb quality.  Yes, the second half of this live show has made the bootleg rounds, but not in this quality--the crisp sound here restores/reveals the powerful energy the bootleg lacks.  And though I do lament they didn't squeeze Bonie Maronie on here, the missing Pinball Wizard/See Me Feel Me is not essential at all (the Woodstock versions on Kids Are Alright are much more inspired).  And look what we GET--live Love Ain't For Keeping, Pure and Easy, and Time Is Passing (NO ONE suspected they peformed THAT tune until this release).  And Young Man Blues smokes, I'd never heard a '71 version.  And Naked Eye &amp; Water are full-length here, whereas they were edited on the previous remaster.<br />As for the studio Record Plant stuff, Behind Blues eyes is wonderful (as we knew from the previous release), Love Ain't For Keeping--with Pete singing--is the definitive version (as we knew from the Odds 'n Sods re-release, but it's nice to hear it here in context), and Won't Get Fooled AGain is wild...you can actually hear the band giving it shape &amp; form as they thrash about on it; it may be missing Roger's trademark scream, but his deep growly vocal rages much closer to live intensity than on the standard version.  And yeah, Leslie West plays lead axe on Baby Don't You Do It, but the band still smokes on it, and I'm certainly glad they dug it out of the vaults (if they wouldn't have, someone ELSE would've complained, I'm sure....).<br />The booklet claims that the studio Time Is Passing was from the Olympia session, not the Record Plant (as Odds 'n Sods asserts), so I guess that's why it's not here.  I reallyDO wish it was, along with Let's See Action, Mary (Pete's demo is worthy enough) and the studio versions of Naked Eye, I Don't Even Know Myself, and Too Much of Anything.  I would've preferred that these songs and the &quot;standard&quot; version of Pure and Easy were the bonus tracks to the Who's Next disc--making it closer to a complete Lifehouse studio album--and that the Record Plant session was on a separate bonus disc.  But you can't have everything, and it truly would've taken 3 discs to have all of the above.<br />As for Relay, Join Together, and Put the Money Down, those were recorded in '72, NOT at these sessions (and studio Water wasn't recorded till '73).  So they don't need to be here (though in my scenario above there'd have been room for them on the Record Plant disc, along with John's When I Was a Boy, a great non-Lifehouse track that WAS recorded in '71).<br />No matter how you slice it, this is a stellar two-disc set, I think alot of love was put into it and I send some of the same back to all those involved, especially Pete, Roger, and, wherever they are, John &amp; Keith.
B00009L1TA|3.0|I originally had no interest in this film when I first heard about it. I thought it was going to be another military film with a lot of explosions and solidiers yelling at each other. Well, that's what I got with this film except there's a supposed murder mixed in there. I thought the flashback scenes were interesting because it gave different views of the same story. John Travolta plays and ex-Ranger who is now a DEA trying to solve the murder of Samuel L. Jackson's character while on a training mission in Panama. Only two people survive the training mission, so Travolta is asked to come in and get to the bottom of the murder and get the stories straight.<br />Sometimes you can get a little annoyed watching some of the same things over and over again, and possibly think to yourself, &quot;can we just get to the end of this, please?&quot; There are a lot of twists and turns to this film and the ending will leave you either disappointed or happy. I won't give away the ending, but you might want to watch it twice to catch everything.<br />All in all, I thought &quot;Basic&quot; was a pretty good film, but watch it for yourself and see what you think. As you can tell from other reviews, feelings have been mixed.
B00009APK1|5.0|Following in the tradition set by its predecessor &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; continues where &quot;Fellowship&quot; left off.  The two hobbits Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) begin their journey to Modor to destroy the ring.  Along the way, they encounter Gollum (Andy Serkis), a mysterious creature who agrees to be their guide, but Gollum is hiding a secret of his own.<br />Meanwhile, the battle between the forces of Sauron and the people of Rohan wages on.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have joined forces with the people of Rohan to thwart the attacks of Sauron's Orcs and his evil magician Saruman (Christopher Lee).  Determined to make Rohan an example in his desire to rid Middle Earth of Men, Sauron has unleashed his full fury against its people, but the people of Rohan, led by their king, once under Sauron's control but freed by Gandalf (Ian McKellen), have retreated to their mighty fortress of Helm's Deep.  It is here where they will stand and fight.<br />The battle scenes at Helm's Deep are the high point of the film.  The special effects are like none I've ever seen before.  I thought the ones in the first movie were good, but these are much better.  The acting is superb throughout, but I think Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom deserve special recognition.  Their characters of Aragorn and Legolas are my favorites, and the producers could not have picked two better actors to fill these rolls.  I cannot wait for the final installment &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.  If its anything like &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, then it will be nothing less than excellent.  Watch this wonderful movie and see Middle Earth come to life.
0385512104|5.0|This book is written from the viewpoint of a young teen with Asbergers.  Besides being a very good mystery novel the real highlight is taking you into the world of someone who's brain works in a fundamentally different way than the &quot;norm&quot;.  This book should be required reading for anyone in public service like firefighters, police, teachers, etc.  It would help them understand that some people will react differently to them and how to help work with them.  Please buy this book and pass it along to friends.  Understanding how to work and interact with people of all types including Autism and Asbergers is very valuable.
0312305060|4.0|Three Characters - Three Lives and there lies the imprints of an author Virginia Woolf in 'Mrs.Dalloway. The Hours pays ironic tribute to Virginia Woolf, the acclaimed author of many pathbreaking novels, who committed suicide in 1941. Michael Cunningham became the winner of the Pulitzer prize and no wonder its been a contemporary bestseller book. Virginia Woolf, as described by the author is a gifted eccentric and not a writer at all. The central characters are Woolf herself and two other fictional women who are connected with her work in some way. We follow the three women with fascination, concern, watching as Woolf struggles with the novel that will name of the Cunnigham's characters and shape the life of another. As their life unfolds, it is irresistible read and urge to stop Virginia from taking the final step into the river even though Cunnigham has told in the first chapter, that she will and she does. The novel is a turnover pages into the world of three very different women celebrating and mourning their lives. The movie The Hours has three women reaching wider audience with performances given by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman. Though I've yet to see the movie, the Book is par emotional read in an easy chair in the corner of a room and effortlessly plunge into the world of three lives shaping the life of another. A nice Read.
B0000AOV85|5.0|This is great; all fans of the Floyd should see this. The band members and the other important contributors, all telling it the way they remember it. I particularly enjoyed the explanation and examples of how the album was mixed, hearing the different tracks isolated and recombined was incredible. And the extensive bonus material just added to the enjoyment!
B00005RHGK|4.0|Entertaining horror flick that should please all fans of the genre.  Well paced, amusingly cast (Justin Long is adorable, and Eileen Brennan in a hoot), and with all its cliches in just the right places... it's good creepy fun.
B000063T0T|3.0|I love the soundtracks - they've been playing in my car for about a month now, but I am disappointed that so much has been left out.  I wish they would come out with a true Collector's Edition which features all of the music (ex. Zidler's Rap, Kidman's final Come What May), by the actor's who sing it in the flick (ex. Nature Boy by J. Leguizamo) and in it's COMPLETE version (ex. Tango de Roxanne.)  The soundtrack is still amazing, it just leaves me wanting more.
B00005JMCW|5.0|NOTE 2/7/13:  This review has been moved from the Theatrical Release Page, as that page has been deleted.  This is not a review of the special features or quality of the DVD, but only the film itself.<br /><br />  ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />  Disney released 3 gems this summer:<br /><br /> 1. Finding Nemo,<br /> 2. Pirates of the Carribean<br /> 3. Freak Friday<br /><br />  This film is a simply hilarious movie. It is so good for 3 reasons:<br /><br />  1. Jamie Lee Curtis - She does such an amazing job when she's playing Hannah trapped in her mothers body I believe it really is Hannah.  It is a true joy watching Curtis really embody a teenager in a grown woman's body, it is fantastic!<br /><br />  2. Lindsay Lohan - I had seen Lindsay Lohan in a couple movies, a remake of 'Parent Trap' and 'Get a Clue', a Disney channel movie. Although she was good, she'd yet to impress me, but she proves her ability as a comedic actress in this film, and is an equal match to Jamie Lee Curtis's physical comedy and zany antics.  When Lindsay plays the mom trapped in her daughters body she is absolutely fantastic and hilarious.<br /><br />  3. The chemistry of the two leads; Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis play off each other wonderfully as mother and daughter. They have a very natural chemistry, and there are some great moments, to many to count really because this movie all togther is just hilarious. It doesn't feel contrived it feels natural and well paced.<br /><br />  This is the perfect movie for mothers and their daughter(s). I saw it with my mom and we loved it. We so many parallels between us in this film.  Especially the seen where Hannah's mother tries to wake her up. :D  Its absolutely hilarious. Even if you're a boy. If you have a sister I'm sure you can relate to this as well. :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I'll admit nothing beats the feeling of watching the Matrix for the first time, and Reloaded doesn't compare with that feeling, however Matrix Reloaded warrants a repeat viewing and more viewings after that because the subtext of the film is nothing short of amazing.  It's deep folks.  And the anti-climax is in my opinion almost as shocking as the twenty minute mark into the first.  Read into it, and you won't be disapointed.   I can't wait until Revolutions.
B00005ATQD|2.0|It's been too much noise around this movie that I fianlly gave in and took a look. I'll briefly summarize its major pluses and minuses for there is already so much said about it.<br />Plus:<br />1) Nicole Kidman subtly shows us the promise of a good actress--as we are given to see in The Hours.<br />2) Tom Cruise does a decent job only in the second part of the movie, when his monochrome on-the-screen personality fits the subdued nature of the part.<br />Minus:<br />1) For the first 1/2 of the movie, one has the feeling that Tom Cruise is playing the part of Al Pacino. His boyish California style would not stand a day in the shoes of a successful and confident New York medical doctor.<br />2) A mediocre story that's so stamped geographically and temporally (Vienna's 1920s) does not translate into the the New York of the 90s.<br />Nota Bene: Since Al Pacino showed us great acting in roles with such different degrees of confidence, ranging from Donie Brosco to The Godfather, casting him instead of Tom Cruise would have made so much more sense. Oh well, there is more besides shortcomings realated to the casting to speak of the dismal state of Kubrick's late hours.
B000002KKS|5.0|Man, this was a total transformation. From the opening chords of NEON KNIGHTS, you know something changed drastically in the band, much more than a troublesome change of singers (Dio replacing Ozzy). It has a totally different sound, more powerful, more crisp, more &quot;talented&quot; (production courtesy of Mr. Martin Birth, a magician who went on to produce the best Iron Maiden albums. By the way, where is he nowadays? Probably turning down offer after offer...)<br />There was a total change, including lyrical approach (by the way, if somenone can explain me the meaning of Dio´s lyrics in this album, please call me!!). The bass is loud, really loud, ad Ward never sounded fresher. Man, the eight tracks are awesome, fantastic (yes, even WALK AWAY. It may be a little pop, but the band play it with conviction, adn Dio´s voice is at its peak on this one.)<br />LIke the old saying goes, good things never last, and this line up lasted only one album. Appice replaced Ward for MOB RULES, still featuring Martin Birch handling the production, and this was also a very, very strong album. THen, Dio left, the band accusing him, him accusing the band, and Sabbath became the solo project of Tony Iommi.

B00000IMTF|5.0|This is one of those albums that is a total classic. <br />The second Rainbow album is a &quot;dream band&quot; byitself: Dio, Blackmore, Powell, Bain and Carey. Uau! All of them at the peak of their creativity, energy and youth. Dio´s voice will leave you breathless, wondering how can someone sing like that in a rock record.<br />Unfortunately, this line up would not last long (Blackmore´s famous bad temper being the cause, I guess...)and Rianbow would try to make America using the pop singer Joe Lynn Turner...
0316666343|5.0|This book touched me to my very core.  I couldn't put it down, and once I finished it, i wanted to immediately reread it.  It is one of those books that I will read and reread over and over again throughout my life.  I recommend it to everyone.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This seems to be one of those discs that people love it or hate it. I think its Wilcos best disc. It broke them out of the \\"alt country\\" mold, and freed them up to make anytype of music they want. People expect a lot from each release following this disc. There also is a great bootleg demo disc out there as well that is worth searching for
B0000025T6|5.0|Needlessly to say, it's not an easy listen, nor for the faint of heart.  However, its beauty and poetry gets revealed upon each listening.  Every time I listen to it, I find something new to enjoy.  For example, as I write this review I'm struck how the title track could easily be the follow up to &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, if the protagonist of the former song was a serial killer making the invitation to the wild ride.  Highlights are many, but my favorites are &quot;Open All Night&quot;, Atlantic City&quot; and Highway Patrolman&quot;.  Equal parts delicate and fragile, mean and ominous, I turned to &quot;Nebraska&quot; as a respite from the over-hype of &quot;Born In The USA&quot;.  Springsteen's best?  Nah.  &quot;Born To Run&quot;'s cinematic scope and sway will always remain my personal favorite.  But, for anyone who can appreciate the cold stark poetry of Johnny Cash's wonderful line from &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, (&quot;I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die&quot;), Nebraska mines that same vein.
B00000729S|5.0|Will you please post the sound clips of this album?  People will buy it if they can just hear it!!!!
0671042858|2.0|i took up this book because i expected something much more than the book actually has.I has very little to give the readers.Its just BORING.This was the the first Stephen king that i read and i was really dissapointed.But the desciption of the woods is  very well written in the book.That is the only plus point.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Absolutely incredible blues, blues/rock album. The intensity, fluidity and power of this young man and his tight band are just amazing. Real feel for the blues, vocals and slide guitar are right on. This guy is the real deal and should be on the brink of HUGE success. He has been touring almost non-stop for at least the last two years, paying his dues over and over. It shows in his playing. Forget all the wannabees in this genre, this young man has it. You've GOT to get this album.
B000002HPV|5.0|Endlessly inventive and with a voice you either love or hate. While &quot;Homogenic&quot; isn't her most adventurous work it's definitely her most accomplished and concise effort to date. Highly atmospheric and complex, it is one of the better albums by a mainstream artist of the 90s.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film defies an explanation.  It's David Lynch.  What more can be said?  The DVD is bare-bones, but the transfer is superb.  I adore this film such as a flower adores the rain.  It is haunting, beautiful, astonishing...simply breath taking.  Though it is long, and offers no chapter skips, it's to be viewed without pause.  The only pause will come after the credits roll, and then watch it again.
B00006CXSS|5.0|There are few greater achievements that have made their way to the small screen than the HBO mini-series \\"Band of Brothers\\".  This 10-part epic is based on the book of the same name by noted historian Stephen E. Ambrose, which tells the story of the men of Easy Company, and elite World War II unit of paratroopers from the beginning of their training in 1942 through all their epic battles until the surrender of Germany in 1945.  Ambrose's book is one of the best military histories I have ever read.  With the \\"Band of Brothers\\" mini-series, the story of Easy Company is realized visually in a way that few war dramas or books have ever been.  The 10-part, 12-hour length necessitated its development as a television mini-series, yet \\"Band of Brothers\\" far surpasses anything I have seen committed to the big screen.  Each episode tells a different story from a different point of view along Easy Company's journey from training until the end of the war.  Lieutenant (later Major) Richard Winters is the focal point of this series.  It was Winters whose contributions and assistance helped Ambrose write the book in the first place, and he is the one who is conscience of the Company.  Each episode brings a fresh perspective to the stories told and are briefly summarized:  <BR><BR>Episode 1 - Curahee:  This first episode focuses on the earliest days of Easy Company under the training of the vicious and petty Captain Sobel.  Sobel's actions make Easy the finest company in the Regiment, but also prove him to be a petty leader and an inept battlefield commander.  This episode shows how Easy originally came into being and how they developed in the unit that would become Hitler's worst nightmare.  It ends with the spectacular image of the C-47s flying over the English Channel on the way to the start of the invasion with the massive Allied flight sailing below.  Few images are as awe-inspiring.<BR><BR>Episode 2 - Day of Days:  The second episode begins with the paratrooper drops behind German lines the night before D-Day and focuses on the assault let by Lieutenant Winters on fortified German guns on D-Day.  Winters is thrust into command of Easy Company when the previous commander dies aboard his C-47 during the assault.  The images of the nighttime airdrop are truly nerve-wracking and breathtaking.  It should be noted that Lt. Winters' assault on the German fortified guns is still textbook material at West Point today. <BR><BR>Episode 3 - Carentan:  Having successfully invaded France, the Allies (Easy Company specifically) are charged with capturing the town of Carentan, followed by a cross field battle with German armor.  Much of this episode is told from the perspective of Private Albert Blythe, a soldier who is dazed by battle and must face his fears to become a good soldier.  Lieutenant Spiers offers sage advice to Blythe by telling him \\"You have to realize that you're already dead.  Then, you can do what need to do\\".  <BR><BR>Episode 4 - Replacements:  Many of the men who initially died are now being replaced by new soldiers.  As they are not original Taccoa men, the replacements are not met with an enthusiastic welcome.  This is all put aside as the disastrous Operation Market Garden is launched.  The focus of this episode becomes Sergeant \\"Bull\\" Randlemen who takes care to watch out for his men and then must carefully maneuver himself to avoid capture by the Germans when he trapped behind enemy lines.  <BR><BR>Episode 5 - Crossroads:  Focuses on a surprise attack on two German companies in the crossroads dike.  This stunning and resounding victory is Captain Winters last as Easy Company commander.  He is promoted to Battalion Executive Officer.  The story shifts to Winters reflecting on the war so far during his `forced' 48-hour leave in Paris before returning the Easy Company men to battle when the Germans break through and start the Battle of the Bulge.<BR>Episode 6 - Bastogne:  Deals with the terror of repeated German shellings and assaults upon Easy Company's entrenched line.  Doc Eugene Roe becomes the focal point as he tries to patch together wounded and preserve his own sanity.  There are some gruesome wounds depicted in this episode. <BR><BR>Episode 7 - Breaking Point:  The men of Easy are at their last threads as the constant mortar attacks continue to wounds some soldiers and claim the lives of others.  First Sergeant Carwood Lipton keeps Easy together in spite of the inept leadership of Lieutenant Dike.  In the subsequent attack on the town of Foy, Lieutenant Spiers relieves Dike when Dike freezes and leads Easy to a successful assault. <BR><BR>Episode 8 - The Last Patrol:  Private Webster has rejoined Easy in Hagenau but is not well-received after having missed Bastogne.  The men of Easy begin to realize that they may actually make it out of the war alive and are disheartened by dangerous assignments like a patrol to capture German prisoners for intelligence.  <BR><BR>Episode 9 - Why We Fight:  Captain Nixon deals with the consequences of his alcoholism while the Allied forces accept the surrender of 300,000 German soldiers.  During a patrol in the Alps, Easy Company stumbles upon a horrible sight, a Nazi concentration camp.  The images of the surrendering Germans are impressive.  The images of the concentration camp are horrifying and saddening. <BR><BR>Episode 10 - Points:  The war in Europe is over and Easy Company captures Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden and acquire the riches that lay within.  While awaiting orders to head to the Pacific war, Easy must deal with the perils of idle time in which men are still dying or are being hurt.  The story of Easy Company ends with the telling of the lives the men lived after the war ended.  <BR><BR>There is no shortage of superlatives that can be heaped upon \\"Band of Brothers\\".  This DVD is an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the bravery of the men of Easy Company.
0780622553|5.0|Dark City is a masterpiece.  It's shame this DVD doesn't have more to offer, but it still goes down as one of the best science fiction films since it's release, or ever for that matter.
B0000000LI|5.0|This is a masterpiece of New Age keyboardist Yanni .<br />I was so disappointed to read in the above review &quot;Not as good as Scorpions&quot; smth about Yanni and Scorpions??????This is totally untrue! After graduation Yanni began playing keyboards for the Minneapolis rock group Chameleon and  he later went on to a solo career. The rest is history. I like rock music too, but this cd has nothing to do with it!If you like rock music and you can't listen to  anything else, this cd and many others are not for you.<br />Thanks to the universality of his inspiring music, Yanni's best-seller, Live at the Acropolis, sold at record levels all over the world, and his concerts drew thousands in places ranging from China to Europe to South Africa.Please give this a try, you won't regret it. <br />PS:(((To B  from Carbondale, IL United States who left the awfull, untrue review:<br />Have you ever been to Acropolis?Have you ever read anything about Acropolis? I am amazed you can  talk like that about the Acropolis, the site of four of the greatest masterpieces of classical Greek art - the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheum and the Temple of Athena Nike .<br />As a scientist and as a human I am disgusted of your lack of culture and respect to human history and to greek achievement. You should write again and apoligize.)))
B0000AOV85|2.0|I consider myself a dedicated Pink Floyd fan, so when they release new items like remastered CDs and DVDs, I buy them. It almost seems as if they know that fans like myself will buy the DVD solely because it says Pink Floyd in the cover. This DVD was rather bland compared to the others like; The Wall, or even Roger Waters and Dave Gilmour in concert. However, I did enjoy the VH-1 program, but it was rather short. Also, the bonus features are only material that was cut out of the original program...boring. They can do better than this.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Unlike many other reviewers i wouldn't rate it as one of Prince's best cause it doesn't contain tracks that can compete with past masterpieces such as \\"sign'o'the times\\", \\"head\\" or \\"condition of the heart\\". To be honest i don't even think that The Rainbow Children is better composed than the average Prince output from the 90's. So why does it sound better to most People? Simply because it's much better produced. Actually this is possibly Prince's best produced album ever...Emancipetion had many very well written songs but the production was cheesy and lacked in emotion and soul whereas the playing here is tight and warm.The big achievement of the Rainbow Children is that the album is crafted so masterfully that it makes its rich and complex music accessible to anybody ( well almost ).<BR>I recommend it to all of those for who Prince represents more than just a bunch of hits.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Kubrick's final work is, without a doubt, one of his best.  With all of the controversy surrounding the film, from the deleted orgy scene, to Kubrick's premature death during final editing, to the length of time it took to film it (two years!), this movie stands as an important and compelling tale.<BR>In case you're apprehensive about watching Tom Cruise walk and talk in a Kubrick film, relax.  He is the protagonist, but his character is not nearly as important as what happens to him and what is going on around him.  The audience can easily step foot in his shoes because the viewer is just as confused as he is - confused in a good way.  My first reaction to the film was that I had to watch it again and figure out what I missed - the viewer is left with many questions.  This is a very deep film.<BR>I have debated with other viewers about the meaning of certain scenes and dialogue, and the conclusion is that everyone is left with their own interpretation.  There is so much going on that I would bet that even many attentive viewers missed much of the details [e.g. (DVD only) pause the movie and read along when Bill is reading the news article about the beauty queen, then read the credits, for starters].<BR>In conclusion, if you can't handle a long movie with a slow pace, despite its rewards, go watch 100 minutes of explosions and one-liners.  If you are a serious movie lover, or especially a movie snob like myself, own this movie.
B000006TRV|3.0|One of the most overrated so-called classics ever...<BR>I think that it is overall a good album with some fine moments but i definitely wouldn't rate it as a masterpiece : too long and  too pretentious. Another thing that i don't understand is how so many persons can find it subtle and scary when half of the album just sounds boring and self-indulgent to me...<BR>Worth buying, though, if you really like Pink Floyd but i guess anybody who like Pink Floyd already has it...
B00005JLXE|1.0|Oh my God, I haven't seen Gigli but I can't imagine it being any worse than this terrible, terrible film.  The thing that kills me is that there are good writers in the world...why are they hiring the people that put together this awful, cliche-ridden, cheesy voice-over using, put-the-exposition-and-motivation-right-in-the-characters'-mouths junk!  And i have to say, I really like Ben Affleck, and I LOVE Jennifer Garner, so I just don't know what the heck is going on here.  As I might have mentioned before, the script is terrible.  Ben and Jennifer's relationship is kinda creepy and misogynistic with violent undertones.  Poor, poor Jon Favreau is stuck slaving away as the lone element of hope in this god-forsaken mess.  And I can't comment about the supposed twists and turns, because I turned the DVD off after 15 minutes.  As a writer, every cell in my body was screaming out in horror at this film.  Terrible!
B00005JKZV|3.0|My complaint is that the thing is just tooooooooooooo long, just like Fellowship.  I enjoy the story (which is why 3 stars is appropriate) and all but how can they expect repeated viewings at 3 hours and they will add more to the Super duper special edition in Oct?  Enough already.  Titanic ruined the movies with its \\"Epic\\" 3+ hour flick.  I don't know about you, but I wait for the DVD on these.

B000083E79|4.0|This is a good, albeit incomplete, collection. Big error--including the album version of &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot; instead of the fuller, hard-to-find single version (which is on Geffen's 1999 collection &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time.&quot;) That said, this collection includes a tad too many minor hits (or non-hits, like &quot;All or Nothing,&quot; &quot;Song For The Lonely&quot; and &quot;A Different Kind Of Love Song&quot;) and omits classics like &quot;The Way Of Love.&quot; A big plus is the impossible to find dance edit of &quot;One By One.&quot; Cher needs a good, 2 CD retrospective. If this were a perfect world, and the companion disc were made for this one, this is what it should include:<BR>&quot;All I Really Want To Do&quot;<BR>&quot;Where Do You Go&quot;<BR>&quot;Alfie&quot;<BR>&quot;You Better Sit Down Kids&quot;<BR>&quot;The Way Of Love&quot;<BR>&quot;Living In A House Divided&quot;<BR>&quot;Don't Hide Your Love&quot;<BR>&quot;Train Of Thought&quot;<BR>&quot;I Saw A Man And He Danced With His Wife&quot;<BR>&quot;Wasn't It Good&quot;<BR>&quot;Hell On Wheels&quot;<BR>&quot;Bad Love&quot;<BR>&quot;Young And Pretty&quot;<BR>&quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot;<BR>&quot;Bang Bang&quot; (rock version)<BR>&quot;Skin Deep&quot;<BR>&quot;Love And Understanding&quot;<BR>&quot;Love Can Build A Bridge&quot;<BR>&quot;Walking In Memphis&quot;<BR>&quot;Dove Lamore&quot;<BR>&quot;The Music's No Good Without You&quot;<BR>&quot;When The Money's Gone&quot;
B00009TB5G|1.0|An even longer version of a movie that was too long to begin with!  The other version gets three stars because you can almost get through it before you die of old age.
B00005JMCR|5.0|I went to the cinema today to see the third and \\"last\\" part of the series, which kept me laughing in every movie.<BR>And to my own surprise I noticed that this is definetely the best and funniest part of the series.<BR>The jokes doesn't sounds old and it's still fresh and dirrty exciting. All the actors are great and the storyline is interesting and gives the audience a good and lovely \\"end\\" of a movie series that will stay in mind.<br />P.S.: My parents did also think that it is very funny.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I won't bother reviewing the film since there are already a gazillion of them, and you've probably already seen it in the theatre anyway. So I'm reviewing the theatrical-release DVD. Picture was sharp and contrasty, but a number of shots exhibited quite a bit of grain for some reason. Either there was very little grain, or a very noticeable amount, it's odd. That was occasionally distracting, but didn't ruin it for me; overall it looks very good. The sound is excellent, dialogue is clear and the sound effects will test your system as much as any soundtrack out there. No complaints there.<br />The extras are pretty weak in my opinion, with several exceptions. There are no audio feature commentaries by the director, actors, or anyone. We get some trailers, and an assortment of television and web documentaries that you've probably already seen. There is a very mediocre short film by Sean Astin that for some reason is in here. Now Sean seems like a nice guy, and a decent actor, but how his little film got onto a DVD that will be seen by many millions of people, I don't understand. My only explanation is \\"filler\\". It has nothing to do with LOTR except for the fact that Peter Jackson appears briefly in it, and it basically looks like your average undergraduate student film, but shot on really nice film stock.<br />The two features that are worth seeing are the preview of the DVD Extended Edition due out in a few months, and some sneak-preview clips of the third film, Return of the King. Of course all the extended edition preview makes you do is wish you hadn't bought this disc and instead saved for that one which will undoubtedly be much, much cooler, as was the one done for the first film.<br />So while the film itself is very good, and gets 4/5 stars from me, as does this disc, I suggest you just rent and wait to get the Extended Edition, which will probably get 5/5 stars from me for both the film and the DVD.
0066214122|4.0|One of the strength of Michael Crichton's is that he writes about such a broad range of subjects, and most of them well done.  This is another example.  That is truly amazing to me.  How does he do it??<br />I'm not sure exactly how likely the little creatures in the book would come to pass, but I couldn't help think back to the nanites in Star Trek.  I do feel very sorry for Julia.<br />But yes, this is another one that read like a movie script.  For that matter, though, didn't a couple other of his books read that way too?  But maybe he is one of the few authors I can forgive for that.  Rising Sun, Jurassic Park, Disclosure all have turned out to be good movies and books.  Prey has great movie potential too.  But he definitely has my respect.  Who else can write about Japanese companies, dinosaurs and virtual reality and space virus (Andromeda Strain), etc., with such aplomb?
B00000JAXT|5.0|I love Robert Wyatt. Matching Mole was the last band he was in before the accident that took his walking away. My Gosh, my gosh! I am listening to this record, recorded in late 71 or early 72 and with this band, they take it WAY outside! This record hints at the Canterbury scene that was and is to come. Lush and wild keyboards, great guitar, and supurb band unity! You can here how the Hatfield and the North were influenced as well as MANY other bands (many played on that album a year or so later). Robert acknowledges his socialist view point, which is probably why this record was not pushed too hard in the United states. It is a shame really as this recording was in it's time and AHEAD of it in many ways. Phenominal spin!
B000002LCI|2.0|When I first time heard Never Let Me Down Again, I loved it.<br /> These days I am still loving it because it's one of DM's strongest and finest songs. It's really music for the masses!<br /> Strangelove the second best track and it has a great chorus. Sacred, Nothing and some other songs are good but the rest of the album sucks. I want you is a horrible song inclusing lover's sounds ( Please Gore,do it next time privately.) Remixs are torturing songs to jails. Listen thisalbum before you buy or you can have a great disappoinment in you DM-collection.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown's managed to do the near impossible.  He's created an intensely readable and interesting book that ultimately misses the mark.  On his webpage Brown states that Robert Ludlum is one of his idols and a mystery writer he tries to imitate.  Well, I've read everthing Ludlum ever wrote and to paraphrase that famous presidential debate: \\"Mr. Brown, you're no Robert Ludlum.\\"  This is not to say that this book is not deeply engaging and extremely well researched.  It is.  However, while Brown is very much at home in the world of Church history, crytology and numerology, he fails as a mystery writer.<br />People who read mystery novels are very picky.  They don't want even a hint of \\"Deus ex machina\\" surprises.  The idea is to fool them up to the end and then slam-dunk them with a totally unexpected ending.  That's what mystery readers crave and why they read the genre.  The cardinal sin for these readers, however, is for an author to pull plot surprises on them that are fundamentally unbelievable.  The Da Vinci Code is chock full of these unsavory plot twists.  Mystery readers know they are in trouble from the very beginning. For instance, the police crytologist who shows up at the murder scene turns out to be the dead man's granddaughter. This kind of uncanny coincidence happens over and over again in the book.  And, most discourageing of all to the mystery fan, without these unlikely circumstances the story line falls apart.  No mystery reader with any experience has much use for this kind of writing.<br />Other readers, like those interested in the inner workings of the Catholic Church, Opus Dei, the Knights Templars, etc, will have a field day with the book.  Even those schooled in Catholic theology will find rich food for thought. And Church history buffs will finally find something interesting to read.  Generally, anyone interested in the dark side of Christianity will find the book fascinating.<br />There is one caveat that needs to be clearly stated: Mr. Brown's description of the 20th century Priory of Sion, an organization that plays a major role in the book, leaves out the group's nastier side. He paints a picture of a well meaning society of influential people who's only purpose is to hand on a secret message to the world at the proper time.  In fact, before and during world war II this organization was extremely anti-semitic and pro-Nazi. The Priory of Sion's publications during this period bare witness to their extreme right wing views.  Either Mr. Brown didn't do enough serious research or he chose to leave out this unsavory side of this secret society which plays such a pivotal role in his story.<br />Aside from that omission, the text is full of intriguing research and little known facts.  It is a most interesting read, but a lousy mystery.rown's description of the 20th century Priory of Sion, an organization that plays a major role in the book, leaves out the group's nastier side.

B00006JI8V|5.0|If you live in Northern Finland, you have to play fast or you'll freeze. Sonata Arctica has paid attention to this advice!<br /> Their debut album opening track &quot;Blank File&quot; is so quick that Tony Kakko has even difficulties to sing it in gigs. Kakko has said that one of his most important models is Stratovarius's Visions album. Double pedals and music style has taken for Stratovarius.<br /> But it's ok because Kakko has found his own personal way to make music and Sonata Arctica is not a cheap Strato-copy. This album is surely one of the convincing debuts I have ever heard.<br /> Tony tells us many interesting stories about computers, Satan, war, love and liars. Lyrics are not write without mind and heart in spite of that fact that they aren't real stories. Band plays well together and sounds are pure and clear. If you like heavy ballads your favourite tracks will be My Land, Replica and FullMoon. They are allready classics, which Sonata fans want to listen over and over again. Unfortunaly, Tony has bored to Replica and My Land. That's why he sings these songs in gig one after another. My personal favourites are Kingdom For A Heart and Letter to Dana, which are absolutely five stars songs. Kingdom For A Heart is a quick and keybords leading song. I think it has written for Satan, but you can make your own bottom lines. Letter to Dana is tribute to Dana Scully ( The X-files )<br /> Personaly,I like most flute in this song. All in all, there is no bad tracks for Eclictica album. Keep going boys!
0684800713|3.0|This early Ernest Hemingway novel, set in France and Spain, exemplifies the lifestyle of the not-really rich and the not-yet famous Anglos who chose to live abroad.  Struggling with various literary and amorous challenges in 1920's Paris, several American and British young men decide to play tourist in exotic Pamplona--the annual scene of a week-long fiesta which is highlighted by many bullfights.  This carefree, dissolute crowd takes life as a lark--superficially at least; inevitably, their extravagant nightlife and lush social habits backfire and relationships disintegrate.  <br /> This story of moral decadence is narrated by Jake, a laidback reporter for an American newspaper; he hangs out with colleagues who are trying to write novels.  Mostly however, they are fatally attracted to the<BR>enigmatic but irresistible Lady Brett Ashley, despite her masculine affectations.  Slightly married to an English Lord yet slightly engaged to Mike, she is accustomed to the homage of men, but she finds herself choked by the ardent, unwanted attentions of Robert Cohn--a Jew who does not really belong in their set, despite his Gentile education. We soon realize that poor Jake is deeply in love with Brett himself, yet he generously sacrifices his own ardor in order to facilitate Brett's temporary happiness. He accepts Mike, is amused by the Count, annoyed by Cohn, but sets her up with his newest acquaintance--a handsome young matador. Ah, but whom will the desirable lady ultimately choose?<br /> This short novel reads fairly quickly; many pages consist of dialogue of short quips, making it difficult to keep clear which characters are speaking. This would make a wonderful play, since it can easily be envisioned in scenes. The final section is brief, but anti- climactic, since the leading lady has left the stage.  The subesequent plot is reduced to just Jake picking up the remnants of his dreams. No doubt this literary let-down is necessary to relax the frantic pace, but readers may resent the lack of action. Dear Jake asks no reward for his unselfish catering to Brtett's every whim.  Is there life for mortal men after the<BR>whirlwind of booze and passion in Spain?  One wonders how much of Hemingway's own experiences are included in this novel...<BR>Moths to the flame?  Whether one approves of Brett's antics or not, she proves one Lady you will not soon forget!
B000002LK1|4.0|This was DM's commercial breakthrough album. Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence and Policy of Truth were important success maker songs. The main role of Policy of Truth has a guitar melody which is fine but can be boring after several listening times. Personal Jesus is also guitar oriented song with gospel lyrics. Enjoy the Silence is a reflexing and soft song. Waiting for the Night sounds like a early 80s Depeche Mode. They are some fillers but all in all this is must better that Music for the Masses
B00009MEJU|4.0|My husband and I rented the DVD, and after the first viewing, though enjoyable, we still had lots of questions. The meaning is left purposely obscure, rather esoteric, but the intention seems simply to explore human concepts of life, love and relationship in death and spirituality. Note the flashback where theism and atheism are argued briefly in the restaurant. Plus, the very \\"gift\\" that Solaris offers seems to be a reflection of reincarnation spirituality, with some minor twists. <BR>   I listened to the Director's Commentary and read the Screenplay, both offered in the &quot;special features&quot; section, and discovered that much had been edited out that would have explained more about events in the film. I would encourage anyone to go there for more answers.<BR>   For myself, however, I really enjoyed Solaris. I loved the rich visual color and found the score, coupled with the flashback scenes between Kelvin and Rheya, hypnotic, beautiful; the story absorbing.<BR>   Although my husband also liked the movie, we would recommend renting before buying, just to be sure it's what you're looking for.
B000050IE6|4.0|The fact that I (and COUNTLESS other fans)have to ask this question just goes to show you how unbelieveably mindblowing these 4 guys are. Opeth is without a doubt the greatest metal band of all time, and one of the most incredible bands of all time, right up there with the classic musicians who've set a standard for new music: Queen, Pink Floyd, Metallica, Led Zepplin,etc. Their ability to seemlessly blend Progressive rock, Death Metal, bluesy acoustics, and folk tunes (all within the same song I might add) shows you this brilliance. <BR>Still Life (their 4th album) is an album anyone can appreciate, but like all their others, it will take a few listens and patience to really come to love it. I would rate this record 4.5 stars because even though it indeed is a lot better then all the other metal and rock you'll find out there, I'm comparing it to their other works. This record would have to be put in the top 3 of thier best albums, which I would say are Blackwater Park, Damnation, and of course, Still Life. The record has 7 tracks, the first 5 are amazing, then comes Serenity Painted Death at track 6 which even though is good, feels about 1-2 minutes too long and takes a lot longer to get into. Track 7, White Cluster is also an above average song, but not one of Opeths best. If you're already an Opeth fan, I'm sure you have this one already. If you're out there looking for some really good new music and are sick of taking chances and spending your hard earned cash on bands that just aren't worth it (believe me, I know how you feel)then I STRONGLY recommend you pick up an Opeth record. I would still suggest you start with Blackwater Park first, because I believe it best displays the true variety of Opeth's sound.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|I am 56 & say with certainty that Lonesome Dove was the best thing that I have ever seen on TV.  Duvall & Jones probably gave their best ever performance.  I am not skilled at giving it the superlatives that it deserves.  I will only say that no matter what your tastes in movies, you won't be dissapointed in this one.  Great story, acting, charactors, & direction.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|National Lampoon's Animal House is one of those classic comedy movies that will have you rolling around on the ground laughing.  The movie is about the Delta fraternity at fictional Faber College.  The Delta House is the worst on campus causing the dean to try and drive them out of the school in whatever way necessary.  Meanwhile, oblivious to the trouble they are in, the Delta brothers continue to party including the plegde party, toga party, and several road trips.  The best parts of the movie involve the raucous parties, especially with Otis Day and the Knights playing at the toga party or Belushi's druken antics throughout.  Either way, this movie is hysterical and should not be missed.<br />  John Belushi is great as Bluto Blatarsky, a brother who has been in college for seven years and has a GPA of 0.0.  His eyebrows alone could tell a hilarious story.  Any scene that he is in is funny whether it be the toga party or when they leave Neidermeyer's horse in the dean's office.  Bluto entering the building is great as he goes mission: impossible style.  Tim Matheson is also great as Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton, the ladies man who refuses to quit no matter who the lucky lady is.  The excellent supporting cast also includes Peter Riegert, Tom Fulce, Stephen Furst, Karen Allen, James Widdoes, Mark Metcalf, Verna Bloom, James Widdoes, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and Bruce McGill.  The Double Secret Probation Special Edition DVD is decent at best.  The widescreen presentation looks fine and the movie is just as good as ever, but the extras are not very good.  There is an unfunny documentary where the cast is interviewed as their characters twenty years later and a pointless music video.  The only redeeming factor is a good documentary all about the making of the movie.  Animal House is a comedy classic with plenty of gross out jokes throughout that will keep you laughing.  Belushi is just as funny as ever so go out and watch Animal House!
B000002UAR|2.0|Given the general positive tone of the reviews, it's disappointing that this CD under delivers.  But with tracks like Yellow Submarine, Here There &amp; Everywhere, Eleanor Rigby, Tomorrow Never Knows and Love You To, I just have to be honest.<br />I think some Beatle albums deserve 5-stars like A Hard Day's Night, but this is not a rocker.
B00008977N|4.0|I own a Toshiba player, and when I played this DVD, I experienced no &quot;blotches&quot; nor &quot;blobs.&quot;<BR>As far as the sound, I didn't notice any major phasing problems between visual/audio.<BR>The vocals, yes, are (i believe)perhaps overly-processed, but I find equal enjoyment in the theatrics and setup of this particular concert.<BR>I'm a relatively new Peter Gabriel fan, and I have never, until I purchased the DVD, been able to see this show.  It was a convenient purchase, and I'll take what I can get.
B000099T2L|1.0|This is not music. Yes, Beyonce has a good voice and has broad range but this CD is nothing more than recycled R&amp;B music that other people have already done, perhaps because at least half the songs are sampled. The lyrics are very basic and childish, and it is overproduced with the same beats as every other song out there. The songs aren't horrible; 'Crazy In Love' is pretty good......and that's about it. The one word I would use to describe this CD is unoriginal.
B00008EY9G|5.0|John Cusak and Ray Liotta are phenomenal in this film, as are the supporting characters of Amanda Peet and Rebecca DeMornay.  Great suspense film in the Hitchcock style that is difficult to pull off successfully!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Cher, is the Best artist on the table, the Show was amazing, all the Dancers, the music, the scene. I consider the best show on many years. greath sound with DTS, greath picture, everything was in the right place
B00006CXXU|4.0|I always thought that Christina was THE talented teen pop star of the 90's.  She has matured greatly with this CD.  A few tracks I could live without, but that is the case with almost every album ever made.
B000002LPD|5.0|This is Van Halens best album with Sammy.  It is a straight forward rocker.  No love songs.  This sets it apart from the other three Van Hagar albums.  In my opinion, it is what  a Van Halen album should sound like(Don't get me wrong, \\"When it's love\\" from OU812 is one of my favorite VH songs). For example, it took me till track four of \\"Balance\\"(\\"Amsterdam\\") to know from the guitar intro that it was a Van Halen song.  If you are a new fan to the band, buy this.  You won't be disappointed.
0156027321|5.0|This Booker Award winning book is well deserving of the high praise it has received.<br />In a nutshell, the book ostensibly is about Pi, a young Indian son of a zookeeper who survives a shipwreck only to find himself on a lifeboat with an odd assortment of animals.<br />The story is much more than a story about survival, although it reads as a wonderful adventure book with many thrills along the way.<br />The book is also a book of &quot;religion&quot;, or a quest to find the meaning of life and of God. Meant for skeptics, agnostics and the religious, the book has meaning for everyone.<br />I also highly recommend this book for book clubs because when you finish the last sentence, you will want to talk about this novel.<br />This is a thought provoking, fun read, with enough ambiguity to keep any group discussion going for a long time.<br />Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm so happy to see the Firefly DVD set for sale at last.  This was the best TV program of 2002.  It had great plots, fantastic actors, (the best ensemble of actors of the entire year) and great special effects.  And it was funny at the most surprising moments, and always intelligent.  For a science fiction show, it was unusual, but that's what made it great.  It would have found a huge audience if left on TV longer.  The quality of the show was just remarkable.  Joss Whedon is to be commended on Firefly, his best work yet, and I look forward to hopefully seeing more Firefly in the future.  Meanwhile, the DVDs will be a great treat!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I loved her first album, but this one topped it by far.  It really shows how far she has come along.  She is a grown woman now and not afraid to show it.  My favorite song is Walk Away because I used to sing and the range this girl has is simply amazing.  I love the bridge of this song.  Fighter would be my second favorite.  Anyone who has been through anything and overcome it can relate to this song, its meaning is totally powerful.  I listen to this CD any chance I get.  I even have it saved on my computer.  If you love to hear music from someone who can actually sing, then this CD is a must have.
B00009V8Z9|3.0|I caught the title track while tooling around on-line one day and liked what I heard.  So, I decided to pick up the whole album.  It's not a record I immediately fell in love with.  This one's taking awhile, but it's definitely starting to grow on me.  Degraw's strength lies in the delivery and craftmanship of his songs.  His lyrics leave a little to be desired (it's not the first time I've heard &quot;Your love fits me like a glove&quot; and it certainly won't be the last!).  The sticker on the CD cover is a little misleading.  I can kind of hear the Billy Joel reference, but I don't understand where they think he sounds like Van Morrison.  I think his music can be easily compared to A.J. Croce. &quot;Chariot&quot; is worth checking out.  A good first effort for an artist who's easily on his way.  Like his lyrics say, &quot;Oh, this is the start of something good.  Don't you agree?&quot;  Yes, I do.
B00005R2M3|3.0|First off, I am a big fan of pop and latin music as well.  However, this album did not meet the expectations I had for it.  I bought it as soon as it came out because I loved her first single &quot;Whenever, wherever&quot;, but there were only two other songs on here worth listening to. The girl can sing but the songs on this album did not represent that at all.  Better luck next time.
B00005RHGK|1.0|To be nice, quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't waste your time.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|First off, the movie was great. Second of all, I personally think a lot of people were disappointed with the movie because they already saw what was coming from the early trailers. Sure trailers give pretty many of the key scenes away, but come on. If you wanted to be surprised or taken off guard, couldn't you have waited a few more months. Third, what's with all these customer complaints? If you didn't like the movie then simply don't watch it again. Is it that hard to figure out? Don't go rent it, and most certainly don't buy it if you were disappointed. I personally can't wait for this DVD to come out October 14. Plus it's a 2 disc set. And from what I've seen from the Revolutions trailer after the Reloaded credits, I think Revolutions will be a fantastic ending. If you are a fan of this movie I have a surprise for you...
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has crafted an intelligent, well researched thriller that masterfully intertwines religion and art history into a rivetting page turner. How is this for a twist, a symbolist and cryptologist are on one night journey to crack the \\"Grail Code\\". It is a lot of fun and is intellectually stimulating. This is the first Dan Brown book I've read but will not be the last. A MUST READ!!!

B00006CXSS|5.0|I rented this remarkable series over the last month. It was incredible. The acting is outstanding, the writing follows and fleshes out Mr. Ambrose's fine work. The use of the real men to introduce each episode provides us with the proper back drop - this is a real story about real men. It follows the men from jump school through the end of the war. I found the last episodes the most moving. The final Disc brings it all together with the interviews of the men of Easy Company.  The 101st Airborne was decorated as a unit for their heroic efforts at Bastogne.The final line of the disc (I believe it is delivered by Major Winters) says it all. \\" 'My grandson asked were you a hero in the war grandpa? '  and I replied '  no but I served with a company of heroes'\\".

0451169514|5.0|'It' terrifies, touches, tickles the funny bone, and in every way, transcends its categorization as a horror novel. 'It' does indeed contain scenes that are best read in the light of day (although the reader will be hard-pressed to put the book down and climb into bed), but King also manages to get to the heart of what it means to be a child in a world where adults rarely look down to notice you, as well as what it means to become the adult that each child holds inside. This is a wonderful work by a writer often stereotyped as 'The Modern Master of Horror,' and it shows that Stephen King just might be The Modern Master Chronicler of the Human Condition. Frightening? Yes. Spellbinding? Yes. Thoughtful? Very. Poetic? Indeed. The denouement is elegant and heartbreaking. 'It' is, at varying times, the intimate tale of each of the individual characters, a group of friends, a monster, and a town; and Stephen King brings each entity to magnificent life. Buy this book! Don't be put off by the size of the tome. The 1100+ pages skip by with practically a life of their own. You won't be disappointed.<br />Also recommended: &quot;Hearts in Atlantis,&quot; &quot;The Dark Tower Series,&quot; &quot;On Writing,&quot; &quot;Different Seasons.&quot;
0783225970|2.0|this was a bootleg. there are problems with the menu graphics and there are two places where the video skips. other than that it was worth the money.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|Having enjoyed all of the other Jane Austen films on DVD I was surprised to find that this turns out to be a true dud. The director displays so little creative fire that he must have been selected by a BBC committee. The lead actors are supposed to convey the romantic tension of the book, yet they couldn't have been less inspiring in their roles. The odd thing is that Siskel &amp; Ebert gave it two thumbs up, and they are usually reliable film critics. While the book is brilliant, I do not recommend this film production of Persuasion.
B000000W6R|5.0|When I was about 12 years old I asked my parents to get me a Smashing Pumpkins CD for Christmas.  I was hoping to get Siamese Dream, but for some reason they picked this one up.  I'm so glad they did, and I'm glad this is what got me started on the Pumpkins.  I think this is their best cd, with Gish and Siamese tied for 2nd.  Every song on here is an absolute masterpiece.  Some highlights of the disc...<br />Starla- I've never heard anything quite like this.  Billy goes INSANE on guitar for the last half of the song.  Beautiful noise.<br />Soothe- gives me chills every time.<br />Hello Kitty Kat- goes to show that this band had more chops than anyone in the \\"alternative\\" music world.<br />Anyway, if you call yourself a fan of SP but don't have this disc, you BEST go pick it up now!!
B0000630BT|4.0|Painkiller sees Judas Priest shedding any remaining baggage from the Turbo era. As a metal record, Painkiller holds it own in every respect. Scott Travis debuts on drums here and is the perfect fit for the new faster and harder variety of metal that will survive over the long-term.<br />The title track is one of the best Priest songs ever. Soaring vocals, double bass drumming, shredding guitars. What more could you ask for? The remaining tracks are all good, solid material. I don't consider Painkiller one of the classics of heavy metal like some earlier Priest records but it definitely put them back in the game.<br />Maybe we can get the next classic Priest record in 2004 now that Halford is back in the fold. Keep your fingers crossed.
B00009V7PK|5.0|Cher is the best, and this tour just proves it, go cher!!
B00005JL96|5.0|I love this movie. Disney's best to date. Gorgeous animation; creative, well-developed storyline; endearing characters; wonderful soundtrack; great message; and lots and lots of fun. Very enjoyable.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Yes, I am a big Madonna fan, but probably different than most.  I don't love Madonna because of her voice or her style so much as I love her for her attitude, her ways of thinking and expressing herself, and her ability to persuade.  Everything she does has a reason, and this album is proof.  Madonna's fans are turning into a cult following as mainstream music buyers (downloaders) are getting older and have discovered people like Lisa Marie Presley and Sheryl Crow.  The old die-hards hairlines are receeding and their wedding dresses are tattered from performing in face on stage night after night.  Few are really able to understand where Madonna is now and how she's changed and who she has become.  The ones that are still left are the ones she wrote this album for.  Not the critics, not the had-beens, nor the people looking for good dance tracks.  <br />This is a simply amazing album which deserves her much applause.  I have always been a follower, though not to a fanatical degree.  But this album feels as though she is singing to me rather than at me.  I don't want to dance to it.  I want to sing to it.  Cry to it.  And for those people dying for dance music from Madonna, just wait.  Being a DJ, and knowing Madonna's intelligence and her ties to the DJ world, she purposely makes much of her music easily mixable.  &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, &quot;American Life&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot; all have some really good mixes out.  Don't be surprised if you see a mix of &quot;X-static Process&quot;, &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; and even &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;.  <br />This is an excellent CD that many different types of music lovers would enjoy.  I recommend it to anyone with an appreciation for song, growth, reflection, and love.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|I have a few albums by Acoustic Alchemy already, among them, &quot;Back On The Case,&quot; &quot;Reference Point,&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Game,&quot; but this is far and away the best.  I thought I'd play it as background music while on the computer but it grabbed my attention.  <br />Even though you might think you'll be on guitar overload with 16 songs, it's just a very enjoyable album that I don't get tired of listening to.  I actually bought this to give to a friend who loves the song &quot;Jamaica Heartbeat,&quot; included on this album, but now I think I'll have to order another copy.  <br />If you enjoy Acoustic Alchemy, I guarantee you'll love this album.
B000099T2L|5.0|Let me start by saying I was not a Destiny Child fan and definitely not a Beyonce fan.  What a surprise this album is!  I gave it a listen because I was force-fed Dangerously in Love on the radio and it grew on me.  The dance numbers are fresh and hot, the ballads are beautiful.  I listened to this one from start to finish and I was not disappointed.<br />This is a first rate freshman effort!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Fabulous rock and roll album from start to finish.  I am a huge Neil Young fan but he does seem to take every other decade off -- the 80s and so far the 00s until this release!!!  Not in his top 10, but right up there with some of his classic stuff.  Better than Tonight's the Night, Ragged Glory, all of his 80s and 00s output.  Lyrics are a bit unusual and take a few listens to get used to, but the music is awesome!!!  Get it now!!!
B00005OAIE|3.0|So this is a little late coming now that John-boy has a new album coming out. This album comes right on the beginnings of old almost-was's turning pop (ie: Liz Phair). Who can point the finger at John Mayer. This album is easily accessible ear candy, albeit can get trifling and trite. John Mayer comes along and fits rather nicely into an era of music that doesn't have a whole lot to say (especially when it's trying to) when a lot should be said. John Mayer, as a songwriter sherks that responsibility for some lighter fair. Songs about little brothers and lunch boxes and dates gone sour. We can all relate to such things with a smirk and will probably shrug it off in years to come. John Mayer seems to have borrowed one of two of the popular vocal stylings of the day... the Dave Matthews style of singing. That might almost make him a copycat, but not quite. His songs, while not having an originality all their own, do stand out amongst the wall of noise that the radio belches out today. So, John Mayer is not a musical saviour and no one ever said he had to be, but if you want instant gratification, upbeat pop, go with this record.
B00008EY9G|4.0|IDENTITY DVD: Last night I popped in this DVD, first I was givin' the option of WIDESCREEN or FULLSCREEN. I choose WIDESCREEN. Second I was givin' the option of THEATRICAL CUT or EXTENDED VERSION. I choose EXTENDED. It would be nice if all DVD's had these options. Director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted &amp; Copland) whips up the perfect crowed pleaser for horror/suspense fans. The movie delivers a chilling atmoshere. It's dark and rainy, a motel setting in an abandoned area. Eventually the cast comes together at the motel, where one by one they are found murdered and evenually they disappear. It's part slasher film, part who-done-it. Basically IDENTITY is a horror movie with a psycological twist. And by my star rating above you can see I enjoyed it. I did however wonder why the DVD isn't in DTS?? IDENTITY stars: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Pruitt Taylor Vance, &amp; Rebecca DeMornay. DVD INCLUDES: Widescreen or Fullscreen / Alternative Ending and Additional scene / Commentary / Deleted Scenes / On the set of IDENTITY / Filmographies / &amp; more.
B00005K3LU|5.0|For several years, without fail, my wife and I would watch \\"Die Hard\\" along with \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" \\"A Christmas Story,\\" and \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,\\" our list of can't-miss Christmas movies.  \\"Die Hard\\" we'd view at other times, but we haven't been able to watch it for a couple of years, because of our two young children who get up late and go to bed late.  We do miss it.  One sign of a great film is that you can watch it over and over again and enjoy it just as much each time; precious few action films are that good.  This one is, which is why it began a new action formula.<br />I saw \\"Die Hard\\" with a friend the summer of '88, and when I went back to college that fall, I convinced my wife (then girlfriend) to go see it with me while it was still in the theater.  She didn't think she'd like it, as she hadn't yet seen a modern action film that she really liked, but she loved this one for its humanity as well as the fun quotient.<br />Willis' character John McClane is not the virtually superhuman, ex-special forces hero who simply cannot die or fail, so typical in action movies of the time; he is very real and human, like Michael Biehn's Reese in \\"The Terminator.\\"  Though it's predictable enough for you to know that McClane will foil the bad guys, at times you don't know whether he will ultimately survive his ordeal, and the viewer really cares about that.<br />Unlike most action movies of the time, there are only two suspend-your-disbelief moments:  the big one is McClane's fall inside the large, vertical air shaft where he miraculously catches a small opening a couple floors down; the runner up is the fire-hose-as-a-harness jump off the blown-up roof, improbable because of how poorly he ties it to himself, as well as the fact that the hose reel likely would have been blown off the building in the explosion.  Apart from these, everything that he does could be accomplished by an intelligent, experienced cop. Action films are so much better when they are well grounded in reality, and don't depend on unbelievable luck or superhuman feats.<br />This film is also realistic about the capabilities of the weapons and explosives used.  So many films are not, especially with regard to guns and the power of different kinds of ammunition.  I remember laughing hysterically at a scene in Steven Seagal's \\"Hard to Kill,\\" where his and Kelly LeBrock's characters are making a getaway from several bad guys armed with full-auto AR-15 assault rifles.  Her little Jeep has a light fiberglass hard top, and as the vehicle's top, sides, and windshield are riddled with dozens of bullet holes from around and overhead, our heroes are neither hit nor killed, which would have easily happened even if the bad guys only had 9mm weapons to penetrate the vehicle.  They want you to believe that the bullets were barely able to make the holes and fell into the vehicle as harmless lumps of brass and lead, but the extremely powerful bullets of the AR-15 could only be stopped by the engine block and a few parts of the suspension and frame, otherwise they would sail through and through the Jeep and still be able to kill someone hiding behind it.  Its 53-grain .223 bullet (used by the DC-area snipers) has a muzzle velocity of about 3,300 feet per second (2,250 mph or 3,620 kph), compared to about 1,400 fps (955 mph or 1,536 kph) for the huge and legendary 200-grain .44 magnum, and 1,200 fps (818 mph or 1,317 kph) for the workhorse 115-grain 9mm.<br />Most people have no clue how powerful even the lower-powered ammunition is.  Many films might show a heavy, wooden conference table like the one in this film stopping the \\"low-power\\" 9mm rounds, but when McClane successfully shoots Marco through the table with his Beretta pistol (\\"Thanks for the advice!\\"), we see an accurate display of why the 9mm is the favorite round of law enforcement everywhere.  The bad guys' Uzi machine guns are 9mm also, as is Hans' stylish little pistol (I do believe); only Karl has a high-powered weapon in reserve.  Such a well-organized group of bad guys would want their weapons to use the same ammo, as depicted, so they could share easily, or use a fallen man's ammo if necessary.  John McClane certainly makes it necessary, doesn't he...!<br />Anyway, characters in these films need not be one-dimensional and narrowly focused to move the action along.  You can have character development, even with bad guys, and have great one-liners too.  You can have a macho good guy who suffers from human frailty.  For an action film, this one has it all:  great casting and good acting; good plot and writing; good sound, effects, and great stunts; good directing and editing.  \\"Die Hard\\" is excellent entertainment and the perfect action movie, very deserving of this special edition DVD!<br />If you don't have it, buy it today!l has a high-powered weapon in reserve.

0679805273|5.0|A wise parable that keeps coming true and shedding insight into different episodes of life.

B00007BH5C|5.0|I must admit it: I am not a big fan of movie music. Aside from the occasional bit of John Williams, I rarely listen to movie soundtracks, as they're mostly humdrum repeats of the same clich&eacute;d themes.<br />Howard Shore, on the other hand, has managed to produce a work (two, if one counts the movies as separate pieces) more in line with classical masterpieces than pop fads. I have rarely heard music as equally stirring and moving as this.<br />Continuing in the admirable tradition of Fellowship's soundtrack, Howard Shore assigns each culture a theme and plays off of these throughout the score. My favourite of these is #6: The King of the Golden Hall. It features the Rohan Theme prominently, which with its Norwegian Hardanger fiddle perfectly captures the essence of the horse-people.<br />My personal favourite on the CD is definitely #8: Evenstar. This is especially brilliant, with all the choral richness and complexity of a Thomas Tallis composition and all the emotional poignancy of the story it complements. Isabel Bayrakdarian is a gifted singer and gives this piece its remarkable due.<br />The one track that I disliked first time around was #19: Gollum's Song. It struck my ear as discordant and rather grating, with Emiliana Torrini's high-pitched, rather nasal voice. However, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it. It captures the desperation of Gollum's state; his anger and bitterness is quite palpable in the music and lyrics and make for an excellent exposition of Gollum's character.<br />This is music at its best, with the power to touch your imagination and your heart. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />~Reviewed by Megan Stoner
B00009V8Z9|5.0|It releases my stress without making me sleepy.  Every single song is just as great as the previous one.  It's so refreshing to spend money on a CD and feel that every penny was worth it.  All too often I would buy a CD and only like one or two songs...  I went a long time without buying any CDs because of this, and Gavin's given me faith again.  It seems to me he combines everything about music that I love so much.  I have no musical talent of my own, so when I come across someone who really touches me I can't help but become attached.  I love his music because if I had his talent, what I think and feel would have created Chariot.  It's like Gavin snuck into my head, stole my thoughts, and turned them into poetry.  Tell Gavin to keep on trucking, great things happen to inspiring people.  When I am 80 my grandkids are still going to be listening to Chariot.  (Because I know they will be cool!)  If ever I have to describe Gavin's music to someone new, \\"timeless\\" is the best way to do it.  No matter what fads exist, or what popular culture is telling us is cool, Gavin's music will always be great.  It's like songs you hear, that no matter what time period they were written, or who wrote them, they will always make you feel good inside.  I think Sam Cooke would have been his biggest fan had he been given the opportunity.
6305971153|5.0|I remember watching this movie for the first time way back in 1985.  I have always loved it and it has remained my favourite Christmas movie.  Few movies have the ability to mix magic and wonder with a real theme.  How many children today have the luxury of believing in Santa Claus?  I was told at an early age exactly what the deal was but that didn't stop me from feeling the magic the first time I watched Santa Claus: The Movie.  As an adult...I can't help but feel a little sad to look back at the innocence and wonder that I had as a child.  Gone are the days when I could go to bed at night, wondering if Santa Claus, or The Easter Bunny, or the Tooth Fairy were going to visit me that night.  I think this movie allows the child in all of us, whatever our age, the feel that magic and unquestioning belief once more. After all, in our increasingly busy and stressful lives, who doesn't need a little magic now and again?  I don't care if some people think the special effects are not spot on.  Keep in mind, this movie was made quite a while ago and can't hope to match the level of computer effects today.  I've read other reviews complaining about this but hey, think about it:<br />If you don't believe...you'll never see.
6303471714|5.0|I have heard both good and bad things about this video, but since I've owned and used it since its release in 1992, all I can say is that I LOVE IT! There are 3 routines (1 that focus on upper body &amp; strength, 1 for lower body/abs and a neat quickie 10-minute any time routine) and they are easily followed and/or modified. I am not as fit or lithe as Cindy is, but I can follow the routines confidently and fairly smoothly...the end result is that I feel good after my workouts.<br />The moves are fairly straightforward, and the music soundtrack that accompanies the routines is soothing yet upbeat.<br />Don't let the fact that her workout wear is comprised mostly of little skimpy bodysuits and Daisy Duke cutoffs sway you or make you feel negatively towards her - I wear yoga pants and a tanktop with a shelf bra and footie socks. Comfy, simple, real.<br />Give this workout a try!<br />(don't forget to talk to your doctor for a few tips on the best workout routine for you)<br />:o)
B00008NRLX|5.0|Where have you been all my life Jayhawks?  This is the group which dragged me kicking and screaming into the 90`s and modern music having been head in the sand over Eagles and Poco for 20 years.  This the seventh album is a return to the type of music which earned them the tag \\"the new Byrds\\".  Whilst quieter, and more of a one man show, courtesy of the brilliant Gary Louris it is in line with the earlier, Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass which are essential CD`s for any lovers of American roots, Country, Folk.  Top tunes are Eyes of Sarahjane,which in true Poco style is an upbeat bouncy tune but really a break up song, terrific.  Don`t let the World get in your way, Tailspin and in fact virtually all of it.  The highlight is the vocal interplays, which in the 1st half of the album are simply breathtaking.  I'm not sure if there were power struggles going on here because word is that Louris is quite prolific in terms of output.  But when he passes the pen to O'Regan and Perlman the material suffers.  Oh well thats what being in a democracy is all about, right?      The Jayhawks sound pays homage to Gram Parsons, Richie Furay and all the other champions of Country Rock, albeit in a more Garage feel and is the link between the Jack Johnson`s, Ben Harpers and Ryan Adams of this world.  Nice touch with Bernie Leadon playing banjo on track 2.  Other guests include Matthew Sweet, Chris Stills and would be famous, son of, producer Ethan Johns.    I would play this at least twice a month, usually at home full volume and its a favourite to try and turn people on to to the Jayhawks when we have visitors.  And I've had a couple of successes.    Buy it you will love it.

0385512104|5.0|I enjoyed this book throughly and managed to read this in one day. It is a refreshing look at autism through the mind of someone who is autistic. Each chapter is numbered by prime numbers (because the boy is fascinated with these numbers) and many of the pages contain pictures that describe word problems or they contain mathmatical problems that he explains the answers to. The language is very simple and although the language and dialogue are simple it still manages to have a few twists that you weren't expecting. I would highly recommend this book!
B00008EY9G|2.0|Hackned script and bad acting by all but a couple of actors.  I found the ending different but unsatisfying.  At the beginning, the dialogue was mumbled and low, so I tried to turn on the Closed Captions, and found there was none.  Alfred Hitchcock did the Bates Motel much better.
B0000AM6LY|4.0|I didn't think I'd become as quickly addicted to a CD as I have this one.  The first three tracks (\\"Home,\\" \\"Fake,\\" and of course \\"Sunrise\\") are uniformly marvelous.  Even though \\"Sunrise\\" is the album's ostensible \\"hit\\" (and deservedly so), the title track \\"Home\\" is achingly beautiful and really sets the tone for the subsequent numbers.  The rest of the CD is a tad more uneven, what with Simply Red doing an odd mismash of 1970s retro-soul and, in a surprise, a Crosby/Stills/Nash-esque piece (\\"Something For You\\").  The unevenness doesn't distract, however, from the overall wonderfulness of the CD.  A great return for a great band, and well worth the money.
B00005YW4H|5.0|In this day in age, where the music industry is one vast pop emporium dominated by the likes of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and those annoying boy bands, Norah Jones is like a breath of fresh air.  She has an incredible voice without having to squeeze every drop of emotion out of every single note.  Her deceptively simple piano playing complements her cool yet sizzling vocals perfectly.  And, this is only my opinion but, she doesn't have to prance around on stage in skimpy outfits and raccoon-like circles of eye makeup to be far more attractive than the two aforementioned female artists.  There's not a bad track on this album, and I give it 5 stars.
B000002GQJ|5.0|I had really forgotten about the Moody Blues, having failed to replace all of my vinyl with CD, for at least 15 years. I have started replacing the collection, and this entry simply doesn't sound dated. What is especially durable is the lyrical content of the songs. There is a fine relationship between melodic form and the weighty themes that are explored in the poetry.<br />&quot;A Question of Balance&quot; is a superb example of the concept album.  &quot;Question,&quot; for some, is incoherent and incomprehensible.  I guess it only took me about 30 years to figure it out. The manic opening and closing announce that hate and death and war will be explored in the songs that follow. Justin Hayward sings the lushly romantic B section with extraordinary feeling, in which love is presented as the problematic alternative. The selfishness that can destroy a personal relationship also explains the &quot;burning greed&quot; that brings chaos to all of humanity.  Gorgeous antithetical images of nature, such as the crashing of the sea and the grey of the morning reinforce the contrast between violence and peace.<br />Pinder's &quot;How Is It We Are Here&quot; follows the same, simple ABA form of &quot;Question.' The lyrics are contemplative of existential matters, and feature a great fuzzy guitar solo and an atmospheric accompaniment on mellotrons evocative of the grandness of the universe. Pinder's vocal delivery is crisp and clear, giving the impression that the singer is an authority on the complex issues being explored.<br />&quot;And the Tide Rushes In&quot; revisits the use of imagery from nature to reinforce, in this case, the vagaries of love and amibition. Thomas's singing is straightforward and calm, as he expresses a certain resignation in the face of uncontrollable forces. The simplicity is underscored by a spare instrumental accompaniment on acoustic guitar.<br />&quot;Don't You Feel Small&quot; analyzes the situation of the human being in the vastness of the cosmos, which again relates well to the themes introduced in &quot;Question.&quot; The effective double-tracking of the sung vocals and whispering gives the impression that one's inner voice is nagging the conscience with doubts about the human condition.<br />&quot;Tortoise and the Hare&quot; is a retreat into the rat race of daily life, represented by an enjoyable, rocking beat and less ponderous themes.<br />&quot;It's Up to You&quot; begins as an easy-going rocker with heavy bass and great guitar. Hayward moves the listener again with his soulful voice as he presents love as the place to seek refuge from the world.<br />&quot;Minstrel's Song,&quot; like Lodge's other entry, &quot;Tortoise and the Hair,&quot; is lighter, an enjoyable interlude that introduces the very beautiful &quot;Dawning is the Day.&quot; The ABA structure this time features a quiet introduction and conclusion, which frame an agitated central theme. Hayward's voice is again majestic, as he alternates between tenderness and desperation. The images and themes relate to the central concept, the optimism being somewhat muted as the chorus repeats &quot;Listen, we think we have found you.&quot;<br />The descending melody of &quot;Melancholy Man&quot; evokes a sense of falling into the abyss, and this is dramatically played on the synthesizer. Pinder's matter-of-fact delivery contrasts with the pessimistic message. He becomes more animated as he cries out &quot;believe me.&quot;<br /><br />Some of the spoken passages in Moody Blues albums can seem pretentious, but not in &quot;The Balance,&quot; a story in only two verses that juxtaposes two seemingly unrelated events, one being the mere eating of an orange, and the other being regret for transgressions.

0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has written an immensely enjoyable thriller that will grab your attention on the opening pages.  Blending vivid characters with fact, fiction, history, speculation and myth, The Da Vinci Code takes the reader on a fast paced search for the identity of a murderer.  The victim is the renowned curator of the Louvre, a man of diverse interests who uses clues originally planted by Leonardo Da Vinci and others, to protect and preserve an ancient secret.<br />Rousted from his hotel bed by the French Police; Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor and symbologist is brought to the galleries of the Louvre to witness and interpret the scene of the crime.  Clearly the victim intended to communicate a message, however the meaning of it is as mysterious as the motive behind his murder.  Aided by the granddaughter of the victim, a trained cryptologist, Langdon is thrust into a frenzied search for a killer; a search that might also lead to the answer of Christendom's most revered mystery, the Holy Grail itself!<br />Nothing is ever quite what it seems, as each puzzle unfolds to reveal yet another question to answer.  Doubt regarding allies and enemies persists as agents from French and British law enforcement, religious historians, the Vatican and Opus Dei jockey with the protagonists for the possession of a secret maintained by the mysterious Priory of Sion for almost two millennia.<br />What sets this novel apart from the usual murder/pursuit genre is Mr. Brown's ability to merge details from art history, symbology, mathematics,  forensics and theology into such a readable story.  Descriptions like \\"page-turner\\" and \\"couldn't put it down\\" are more than appropriate for The Da Vinci Code.  You'll find yourself racing the characters to interpret the various clues and puzzles, while breathlessly awaiting each turn of the plot.  Upon reaching the end, the only question that might remain is \\"exactly how much is true... and how much is fiction?\\"
B00002E224|5.0|I stumbled across this film on late night channel surfing and fell in love with the love story of Jesse and Celine. From that day on, I make a point of watching it late and avoid watching it too many times as not to spoil the magic of the film. <br />Dialogue between these two characteres played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy carries the film from beginning to end. The screenplay for this film and the interpretation by these two great actores is a work of art. I highly recommend this film.<br />After searching everywhere and not having any luck, I finally bought the DVD on Amazon.com. The problem is that it doesn't play in my DVD-ROM :-( ... I guess I'm going to have to go out and buy a real DVD player... oh well... hopefully it will work then.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar does it again! What sets their previous efforts apart from other computer animated films has been their equal emphasis between aesthetic quality and a quality story. And again they succeed on both counts.<br />It's a multilayered set of themes that make this story so effective. There is the basic umbrella of a parent frantically trying to regain his son, while working against his own fears. Meanwhile the son strives to master his own potential and an independence thrust on him by his own rash action. Throw in a sidekick with severe short term memory loss, a group of sharks trying to maintain themselves on a twelve step \\"no fish consumption\\" program, surfer dude sea turtles and precision formation fish schools and you have enough enough comic elements to satisfy both kids and adults.<br />Marlin the Clownfish is the surviving parent Nemo, determined to avoid loss and protect his inquisitive son. Like so many other children, Nemo reacts to Marlin's protective smothering with an impetuousness that leads to his capture from the waters of the Great Barrier Reef and transfer to an aquarium in a dental office. Dad resolves to find his son, while son struggles to regain his bravado and freedom with the help of the other prisoners of the aquarium. Albert Brooks gives voice and angst to Marlin, with Ellen Degeneres a standout as his new -- and very forgetful -- sidekick, Dory.
0451163516|2.0|This could have been a much better book.  So much good raw material and fascinating history, as noted by other reviewers.  But, also as noted by other reviewers, his plotlines are often too implausible.  I can suspend belief to a certain degree, but all too often Follett comes up with plot turns that are so implausible that it spoils the story.  Follet can do better than this.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I am nearly fifty years old.  A sober grown man.  With children.  Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies.  Many of which I have enjoyed.  And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication.  The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. <br />But still, these are after all just children's movies.  In another life, I would never have seen them.  And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one? <br />And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney \\"adventure\\" movie.  Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965.  I mean really, how much can you expect? <br />And then, it happened.  The swirling intoxication.  The stunned feeling.  What?  Who? How?  Was this a movie? Or a religious experience?  Perhaps more like an addictive experience...<br />I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand.  I have now seen \\"Pirates\\" four times.  The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand.  I cannot get enough of it.  It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of.  My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, \\"Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?\\" <br />And that Depp fellow.  My God.  I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music.  Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s? <br />I am a straight male.  I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female.  But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars.  He is simply extraordinary.  So sly, so seductive, so canny!I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow.  I can see why.  His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame.  How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb? <br />I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.  <br />Except for this year.  <br />Go Jack.<br />And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely-connected \\"money shots\\" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, \\"You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!\\" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing.  And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey. <br />And now to the music.  I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking \\"overproduced by\\" credit on the cover-liner.  \\"Bombastic.\\"  \\"Overdone.\\" \\"Absurdly Stupendous.\\"   <br />Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things.  To me, it is absolutely transporting.  I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance.  It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.<br />Once again, the children were wondering, \\"What's up with Daddy?  Is he OK?\\"<br />Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way.  But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, \\"Now, bring me that horizon.  Drink upme hearties, yo ho\\" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.<br />At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.     <br />This is not just another \\"entry\\" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes.  It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\"  I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure.  I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.
B0000669JL|5.0|I must say, I've prided myself on being only 22 and having an appreciation for music of my parent's generation.  Among my favorite artists are the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix just to name a few.  I was rather bothered to not know one song by Bob Marley, so I snagged my dad's Bob Marley &quot;Legend&quot; cd to take to work and I listened to this impressive collection all the way through 3 times in a row!  I had been sitting on such a treasure for quite sometime and didn't even know.  This music is inspiring, funky, eclectic, thought-compelling and classic, unlike the dry, monotonous music of today.  You will truely enjoy this cd.  How could you not?!
6304973187|4.0|This is probably biased, as I have a real weakness for modernised Shakespeare, and so really enjoyed this film just for that.  There's been a lot of argument about whether it's any good or not, and most of my points have already been said, but I'm going to review anyway!<BR>The main thing is that you'll probably only enjoy the movie if (a) modernised Shakespeare is something you're happy with (b) you can make the suspension of disbelief required to accept modern-day people talking in Shakespearean dialogue.  If you don't feel like you could accept these things, then you'd probably be better renting another movie.<BR>The camera work and overall presentation is extremely dramatic, sometimes over-dramatic, and again, enjoyment depends on personal taste.  In my opinion, the camera work mostly produces a vibrant, emotional experience, but at times you do want to just grab the camera and stop it moving so you can take the scenes in more slowly!  Again, though, if you are prepared to accept dramatic camera work, it isn't much of a problem - but if you prefer traditional filming techniques, this one would rather annoy you.<BR>The actors are adequate - Claire Danes does well with the rather anodyne role of Juliet, DiCaprio is a tolerable Romeo, and Pete Postlethwaite is excellent as Friar Lawrence.  Again, at times some performances dip into the melodramatic side, but others are surprisingly sensible.  <BR>I have taken a star off mainly for the hacking of the text, which manages to eliminate some of the most famous lines.  This is a lot more bothersome when you actually know the play as it does jar quite a bit to notice omissions.  This is the only thing that really annoyed me, however.<BR>If you think you could enjoy this movie, I would definitely rent it - even if you don't like it, it'll probably be an interesting experience.  Yes, it probably is slightly spoon-fed Shakespeare, but that's no reason to condemn it completely.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce has taken care of her business on this album.  She's proved what a prolific writer she is, a strong vocalist she is, and shown a maturity that today's pop stars couldn't begin to display.  It's very rare to have a truly talented artist at her age in modern pop music.   My favorite songs on the album are &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; and &quot;Yes&quot;, which are most likely to be strengthening anthems among young women all over the world who have faced the situations in the songs.  Great job, Beyonce!
B00005JM02|5.0|Okay - So it's a kids movie but obviously it was intended for ALL to enjoy. When my wife, 5 yr. old son & me walked out at the end of our 1st of 2 viewings [he swindled us into seeing it twice], I immediately turned to my wife and said \\"They blew it. THIS was the 3D film of the century\\"!!! Why in heaven's name was this not released in 3D?? The graphics and color are \\"stunning\\". The attention to detail was meticulous, as is the case with all Pixar productions. And the story line, which seemed totally impossible to pull off before seeing the movie was done VERY cleverly. I found out later in the week they made spy kids [whatever] into 3D and that movie is mediocre, at best. 3D did NOT save it. And yes, Ellen Degeneris, who usually does nothing for me personally, brought some of the movie's best laffs. Also, the bonus features and the game advertised to complete the set, promise to have my son begging for more.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again!  Hybrid Theory was the first album I've listened to all the way through and not once skipped songs.  While Meteora did not have the same affect on me, it only was a matter of time before I was loving the whole album.  Chester's strong vocals and well-sung angst makes you feel what he's singing, and Mike's straight, to-the-point lyrics add a hip-hop feel to the mix.  The musicanship displayed by Phoenix, Brad, Rob and Joe is exceptional.  All of these things in one album is an explosive combination, which is how I would describe Meteora.  My favorite songs are \\"Don't Stay\\", \\"Lying From You\\", \\"Faint\\", \\"Nodody's Listening\\" and \\"Breaking The Habit\\".  Great album!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Why write a review of a Radiohead cd?  When there are already 553 reviews of HTTT and there are probably 50 others being written at this exact moment. Because this is a great cd that is doomed to be overlooked.  Actually, the real reason is because I'm bored and have 15 minutes before I have to catch the bus to work.  But HTTT is a masterpiece, that's sadly destined to be overlooked.  Radiohead released three brilliant cds right before this and most of the reviews are unanimous in saying that Kid A and Ok Computer were bolth on higher levels.  But I disagree, this may be Radiohead's most accesable cd yet.  Every song on here is just as good as the one before it, yet it still manages to be just as cohesive as Ok Computer.  The only album I've heard that manages to pull that off was Neutral Milk Hotel's classic &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;.  This is Radiohead's most impressive album yet, but its brilliance will never be truly recognized by critics and that's a shame.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This cd was great on first listen, and even after a week of listening to it constantly its still awesome. Good vocals and good screaming too. The songs are long, and the guitar work is very good. I think its better then the previous album, its more melodic. Highly recommended if you like this sort of hardcore/punk, its good stuff.
B0000019PA|2.0|I purchased this album after reading all the reviews on here saying that its a masterpiece. I dont really hear much of this in the music, in fact i find it to be quite bland if not irritating. There are few good songs, but the singer's voice kills them. It's like the band is trying to hard to be something they cant be. Musically it is very simple. If I were you I'd pass on getting this album and check out other bands like the microphones or olivia tremor control. I spent 12 bucks on this album that I'll probably only listen to a couple more times. All the songs sound alot alike and they lack complexity. It's like the quitarist only knows how to do cheesy chords. i dont consider it to be very emotional at all like alot of people who reviewed it. It's really just a bunch of badly written songs with a singer who is painfull to listen to. if this is what you look for in music than by all means buy the album. one of the worst albums I've bought in a long time.
6304169558|4.0|Twister is a film that I first saw in high school, and going into seeing it I had some doubts.  Truth is, I was highly entertained.  I really had a fun time watching this movie.  *sigh* Alas, it's another movie that had great potential to be a five star film but underachieved.  <br />The plot of Twister is very simple, but applicable, you can follow it and I think the plot and storyline were well defined in this movie.  It's basically about Tornado Chasers who are trying to make history by finding a way to learn more about them.  It's an ingenius idea they come up with, don't know how real it is though.<br />The characters in this film are quite entertaining.  I think Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play off each other quite well.  Bill Paxton's character, Bill, is a weatherman who seems to have a nose for storms (human barometer).  Helen Hunt plays Jo, the soon to be Ex-wife of Bill's.  Jo is rather obsessed about this idea of theirs, called Dorothy, because she lost her father in a tornado.  So right away, both characters have an interest, a purpose to the storyline which I really liked.<br />As far as the other characters go, they have either small parts or they are meant for comic relief, but do little to contribute to the plot.  <BR>You have Jonas, the rival to Bill and Jo's party, who steals their ideas and is rather a cheap skate all together.<BR>Then you have Dusty, who's uglier than sin, but is a funny guy and I liked his character.  I failed to really see the contribution of his character, however, at least as far as how he aids to the team.<BR>Then you have Melissa, the soon to be new wife for Bill, who is a therapist who stupidely tags along and while finding herself in these life and death situations constantly is on the phone to a client.  Her character wasn't really needed, other than for comic relief.  She's always a step behind everyone else, and the movie attempted to portray her as an air head or some naive city girl with no clue about storms.  Again,her character was worthless other than the humor she indirectly brings.<BR>And there's a bunch of other guys part of this Storm Team under Jo and Bill that really don't have much of a part at all, other than witty comments here and there and little bits of advice and information they just happen to share.<br />To be blunt, Jo and Bill pretty much hog this film.  The other characters are...well...just kinda there.  I think it would've been great if the movie had just severed out Melissa's character all together and give the other Tornado chasers more time so we at least know who they are and why they are vital to this team.  Because for the most part, you don't really learn any of their names but Dusty's.<br />This shying away from the other characters is one of the reasons why it lost a star, the other is that this film had almost too many unreal parts in it.<br />Unreal part 1: Jo and Bill huddle under an old wooden bridge together as a tornado blows directly over them.  No sir, that bridge would be ripped to shreds and so would they.  Unreal.<br />Unreal part 2: Jo, Bill, and Melissa get cut off by two sister twisters who spin around their truck, making the truck spin around on the road, but doesn't get damaged, doesn't get thrown around.  This was pretty bad, because I don't think this was even close to real.<br />Unreal part 3: Jo and Bill's truck gets stuck on a branch and can't move, while the tornado slings a gas truck at them.  The gas truck hits them, dislodging them from the branch.  Later the gas truck blows up in front of them and they drive through the flames.  OK, a gas truck semi hits them and it just spins them free?  No, I think it would do more than dislodge them.  And driving through gasoline flames?  Uh-uh, if any of those flames hit your gas tank you're history.  Too unreal.<br />Unreal part 4: Jo and Bill out run a tornado on foot.  Then they anchor themselves to a well and while being sucked into the air, they look up and see the center of thetwister.  Um, I don't think it's even remotely possible to out run a twister on foot.  And I don't think you could look up into a tornado because I think there would be so much dust, you wouldn't be able to see.<br />So, despite all these unrealalities that take place in this movie, it's still quite entertaining.  Unrealism doesn't bother me unless there's an abundance of it.  At least the characters recognized they were lucky, and didn't get away with these unreals because they were skilled.  <br />On the plus side:<BR>1. Pretty good acting, with some cliche parts and lines.<BR>2. Very suspenseful<BR>3. Awesome sound and special effects, can follow the sequences of the action all right.<BR>4. Great storyline and plot, with sub plots that present challenge to each of the main characters.<BR>5. Drama and action mix well in this.<BR>6. It does provide some education on twisters and how they form, what they are, the classes of twisters, and the different types.<BR>7. Helen Hunt is stunning in this *wink*<br />So overall, this is a film worth owning.  It's entertaining, it's fun, it's a pretty good disaster film considering it.  My only complaints, and what brought it down to four stars, is the lack of involvement in other characters and an abundance of unreal parts that almost took away the credibility of this film; as far as how much Hollywood really knows about twisters or how much they really cared about being accurate.<br />See this film, you should enjoy it, but I think you'll agree with me when I say this film could've been even better.  But it's good enough.<br />Grade: B+
0441003257|5.0|oh...my...God...and Lucifer, for that matter.  This is one of my favorite books of all time by two of my favorite authors of all time.  This is a treat for anyone who likes either of these authors, Douglas Adams, or Monty Python.  Gaiman has a penchant for the darker, more serious side fantasy (but is not without his own sense of humor) whereas Pratchett is the king of slapstick fantasy (but is not without his own serious side).  In 'Good Omens' they seamlessly blend their styles together to create a beautifully hilarious masterpiece of a novel.  The footnotes, a staple of Pratchett's Discworld novels, are absolutely priceless and indispensable.  There has never been a funnier novel about the end of the world and one would be hardpressed to surpass this apocalyptic literary work of art anytime in the future.  My only hope is that the plans (that have been many years in the making) of turning this novel into a film finally come to fruition.
0671042858|5.0|It seems to me that The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is receiving a great deal of undeserved flack simply because it is not one of Mr. King's usual horror novels.  I do agree that this is not a horror novel, and I can see where fans of that genre may be disinterested in it.  However, I do not see that as a valid reason for such a low review.<br />Mr. King's ability to write characters with whom we may sympathize, and his narrative skills remain undiminished in this book.  Certainly I could identify with Trisha, and envision her struggles in the woods, but the most compelling elements were easily the psychological ones.  Ravaged by fever, hardship, and isolation, while she does not completely go insane, Trisha's mind begins to warp, creating what I might describe as the world seen through funhouse mirrors.  What suspense there is in The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon comes from this.  However, I really do think that those who are focusing on the lack of traditional horror have missed the point, and the opportunity to be touched by the message Mr. King seems to be sending about the power of hope and inspiration.<br />Have you ever had a hero?  I personally have been the beneficiary of inspiration in a difficult situation--inspiration provided, as in Trish's situation, by someone I may never have the privilege of meeting.  Although I have never literally been lost in the woods, nor in a life-threatening situation, I have had to make some very difficult internal journeys.  As I read, I found myself almost moved to tears by the fact that I was (metaphorically) seeing something akin to my own experiences, set into writing by someone else.  Her final encounter with \\"Tom Gordon\\" was easily the most powerful--how touching the few words were, that he spoke--but I'll save this treat for the reader so it has its full impact.<br />Given my very personal experience, I have to say Mr. King has done an outstanding job of depicting such inspiration, and also explaining what it is and is not.  Unfortunately in the English language, we are rather limited when it comes to words for describing attachment to someone.  The word \\"love\\" has been corrupted to where in most people's minds, it comes with physical connotations that make us very reluctant to use it.  Mr. King, however, does not shy away from it, and for that I am glad.  Trish's father, in the narrative, makes the distinction clear--yes, Tom Gordon is Trish's \\"heartthrob\\", and yes, she can see his attractiveness, but what truly makes her feel so deeply for him goes beyond the mere surface appeal and to the person that she perceives underneath.  It is a much higher attachment than a mere crush.<br />Only something greater could have possibly helped sustain Trish through the long, dark, and lonely nights..

B00001U0E1|5.0|My first reaction to this movie was that it wasn't that great, but just overhyped.  It was as if I subconsciously wanted to hate it!  But I ended up saying to myself at the end, Goodness, Shakespeare's awesome.  I loved how Shakespeare's words were used so artistically whenever he thought about Paltrow's character.  It was shocking how much this movie made me appreciate Shakespeare's use of language and beautiful words.  <br />The synopsis is easy: It's an affair story surrounded by the hopeful opening of Shakespeare's new play, Romeo and Juliet, which is named after a few crazy ideas.  They continue to fall in love until a powerful man from Virginia ruins their plans.<br />The acting was phenominal.  Mostly by Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench.  The best out of the three was Judi Dench, playing a wonderfully grumpy Queen Elizabeth.  Although the role was only eight minutes long, she most deservadly recieved Oscar gold.  Gwyneth did not really earn her Oscar over Cate Blanchett.  I think that on the silver screen, rather than the television screens, where most voters watched the movies with DVD's they had recieved, Cate Blanchett would appear more powerful than Gwyneth.  I still thought Paltrow was great, despite Blanchett's beautifully flawless perfomance.  <br />Bottom Line: This movie is a classis play on Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" that will forever be remembered for its great acting and wonderful story. (I give it an A- and five out of five stars.)
B000069AUI|4.0|I can see very clearly that my musical tastes are rather different than some of those who reviewed this album--I favor more heavily layered, experimental works as opposed to simple guitar ballads.  For those of you who are Radiohead fans, I prefer albums like Kid A (although I'm not bashing the others), or artists like Pink Floyd and Peter Gabriel.  Hopefully by admitting to that up front, even those who do not share my tastes will still be able to get something beneficial out of my review, even if it is through disagreement with my conclusions.<br />The strange thing about A Rush of Blood to the Head is that had the tracks been split up into two groups and presented to me at different times, I would have believed they'd come from two different albums.  It is almost as though they are offering two separate musical tracks from which to choose.  <br />The first group, which I consider the strongest (and seem to be the new element in this album compared to Parachutes), are the lushly orchestrated, relatively fast-moving, atmospheric tracks including &quot;Politik&quot;, &quot;God Put a Smile On Your Face&quot;, &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;Daylight&quot;, and &quot;A Whisper&quot;.  In these tracks, Coldplay demonstrates the ability to construct the same rich, unusual atmopshere that Radiohead does, except with traditional instruments, string sections, and strange chord progressions rather than heavily layered synthesisers.  I also think the vocalist's voice works best with these songs.  &quot;Clocks&quot; is the song responsible for getting my attention to this band--as clichéd as it may sound, I feel as if I could soar woth this song.  I know that I've included some tracks in this &quot;A-group&quot; that aren't getting good reviews from most people, but I honestly can't see why.  My suggestion is, please try to hear them with unbiased ears and then make a judgment.<br />The second group of tracks is to me far less distinct and imaginative, and while they may be well suited to radio play, I don't think they quite represent the full potential of the band.  Of these, however, the strongest is &quot;In My Place&quot;, which I quite like.  Unfortunately, many of the others of this category failed to make an impression, such as &quot;Warning Sign&quot; and the title track.  I did not get the sense of great potential from these rather simple tracks that I did from the songs in the &quot;A-group&quot;--they point back to the group's past on Parachutes rather than towards the future.<br />I probably would have been harder on this album if it had come from a more established band, but one thing I can see very clearly is that Coldplay is a band with promise.  Even though I ultimately liked only half the album, I'm being generous with the rating because where they were good, they were utterly mindblowing--probably a 3.5 is the fairest assessment.  Judging from what I've heard of Parachutes, they *have* come a long way.  The thing is, I suspect they are capable of even more than this.  This is a band with a future, and I look forward to their next release, hoping they choose the more intricate, atmospheric direction of the two they have offered.
0380725398|4.0|This is only the second Daphne du Maurier book I've read (the first was 'The Scapegoat'), and I enjoyed it. The story line is good, as are the descriptions of the Cornish countryside. Indeed, the author seems to have a real feel for Cornwall, even though she was born and brought up in London. Not for her the sugary rustic platitudes of other English &quot;country&quot; writers. And bear in mind, too, that she was only in her twenties when she wrote this: quite an achievement.<br />Inevitably the book is somewhat old-fashioned in its style. The prose is inclined to be a bit wordy. But the characters of the Merlyn brothers and the Vicar are well drawn. A slight disappointment, however, is Mary Yellan herself. I found it a little difficult to engage with her, and a rather characterless, even priggish young woman comes across.
0780627024|4.0|Seven years before this movie was  released, there was a short-lived sitcom on ABC called, \\"Hi, Honey! I'm Home!\\" that touched on a similar theme of a teenager from a single-parent family of the '90s coming in contact with a 50s television family that he admired. I have often thought of that show when viewing \\"Pleasantville\\". <BR> Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, and Jane Kaczmarek are excellent in their portrayals of the modern family affected by a trip into the conservative past. Kaczmarek's role as a divorced mother longing for the life she had before made me regret the fact that many parents often don't care how they act or speak in front of their children these days. Although reluctant to embrace her new surroundings at first,Reese Witherspoon's Jennifer/ Mary Sue reprioritizes her life and becomes a better student, whereas she had been failing beforehand. Maguire's David/Bud has an easier time adjusting, but, like his sister is influential in broadening the horizons of the community into which he was magically transported.<BR> Don Knotts was perfectly cast as the television repairman who changes the lives of the siblings. He appeared just in time to prevent Jennifer from having another meaningless fling, which strikes a viewer as a kind of Divine Intervention. Jennifer's old habits die hard at first, but she develops newer and healthier interests eventually. <BR> The black-and white community is a likeable one, but narrow in its views of the world until the arrival of David and Jennifer. Joan Allen and Bill Macy are delightful as the Parkers, but Mrs. Parker's affair with Jeff Daniels' soda jerk could have been left out. There was no need to take realism that far.<BR> Marley Sheldon was sweet as Margaret, and J.T. Walsh, in one of his last roles was surly and harsh as the Mayor who has difficulty  accepting change. <BR> When it is all over, we see both the positive and negative aspects of a bygone era, and feel the need for certain traditional values of the past, but are grateful for the changes of the modern era. The cinematography is innovative, and the story, while not altogether original, is highly engaging.
B00006690G|4.0|* WHITE AMERICA: Eminem seems to be the only person in the public lime-light that can speak boldly, freely, and demanding against the Government and not have a thing done about it. Then again, he earned his place to do this and prove free speach is a welcome thing and anyone against it, should be smacked. I enjoy this song because it's retalorating against those who agree with everyone and think everything's peaches&creame.<br />* BUSINESS: After all the songs he's written and produced as a land-bomb towards all those who doubt him and talk 'ish behind his back, this one kind of tops the cake. Although, I prefer his one with DMX and Obie Trice who I dedicated to my ex-boyfriend, \\"Go To Sleep.\\" It's more violent then this track. If you're avoiding heavy-paced profanity and violence, stick with Business.<br />* CLEANIN' OUT MY CLOSET: The first 10 times I heard it, I enjoyed it. Then I got the CD burned and it faded. If I could write a piece against my family and not be sued, I'd give praise to Eminem. But I'm not looking for a lawsuit nor a murder so I'll leave that to Eminem to fulfill. I like this track because he, in my opinion, throws out words to Mother's like his own. Nobody's perfect but you don't have to purposely pull strings to make it worse.<br />* SQUARE DANCE: Funny song. Heather and me would blast it while I was in TN on Spring Break and listen to it and most of the neighbor's would leave cos they couldn't stand it. Who cares? It's not his best but it shows you can be a smart-bum and still be serious.<br />* SOLDIER: Talks about the real, \\"Thugs,\\" and people who grow up in the Ghetto or who come from a harsh/hard family. It's not easy growing up in society any more cos if your family hasn't been one of the favourites and people are always trying to pull 'ish on you. Eminem, in my book, is a true survivor in many cases. Myself, and more, come from a background like his. It talks about him holding up weight that would otherwise, break any weak-minded andweakened soul person.<br />* SAY GOODBYE TO HOLLYWOOD: Despite the fact I admire Eminem, no matter what kind of commotion he may stir up, I believe him wanting to take a break now and work out the personal life he's trying to have is for the best. He'll cut tracks, break records, and such but I'm glad he's grown up and taken time to realize the important things in his life. I admire him moreso cos anyone in his position never tries most of the time nor do they appreciate where they're standing. They try to do it all easy. Despite all he's had to hold up, he finds time to be a Father. Not many guys can do that and own up to the greatness of it. Mine couldn't, anyway.<br />* DRIPS: Funny but not my taste. To downlow and the lyrics don't grab my attention like his older work.<br />* WITHOUT ME: I prefer the serious/I-Wanna-Slit-Your-Throat Eminem. The qircky (sp?) one kind of annoys me.<br />* SING FOR THE MOMENT: Never will get bored or tired of/with this song. I'm surprised I haven't worn the CD out from playing it so much. He speaks truth on certain issues in America. Kids putting up with abuse. Kids or Teens wanting to be a, \\"thug,\\" \\"gang member,\\" etc. I'm not sure why people who weren't raised in that kind of enviroment would find that kind of life cool or adrenaline-rush-driven. \\"When you live by the gun you die by the gun\\" - Tupac Shakur. I lost close friends to this life. Eminem redid a song and put his views, which anyone will agree 95% of the time, that if you're dealing with 'ish, you can turn this track on and leave it behind. He also talks about people who take 'ish too seriously.<br />* SUPERMAN/MY DAD'S GONE CRAZY: Funniest songs on the whole CD. My Dad's Gone Crazy is possibly the cutest but funniest song he's made. Other then Drug Ballad, old favourite.<br />* HAILIE'S SONG: Pretty explainable. Sweet but I think he should stick to rapping. He sings good though, if you don't mind low-note keys.<br />* WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS/SAY WHAT YOU SAY/'TIL I COLLAPSE: Anger-ventment songs.<br />I've always admired Eminem for the fact he speaks his mind without holding back or biting his tongue. Not too many artists feel free to speak and do this and those who can are those whom I'll respect until their grave no longer exists. I prefer his older stuff over any new recent tracks. He always amazes me with beats and lyrical content. I always find 1 song that always suits me and can represent me. I can't give it a 10 because it's not perfect but well put together. 9.5 fits it perfectly.
B00003CXFG|4.0|I have the unrated version of this movie and I think its pretty cool. I have rented the rated version and i like this one better. You do notice that added footage. Some People say you dont notice it, if you have seen both versions of this movie you do. I like the bleatching effect they did to this film, I think it give it a cool feel that wouldnt would work with other movies of this type. Finally, This is a movie that if you have kids you might be able to let them watch it and not worrie that they might have nightmares.
B00003CXCK|5.0|Schindler's List is the story of Oskar Schindler, who started the war looking to make as much money as possible, but by the end had spent every dollar to free as many of the Jews as he could.  The film is near perfect in every way.  It is gripping, haunting, realistic (the decision to use B/W instead of color was genius), and above all, an accurate portrayal of the times.  I once asked a Holocaust survivor what she thought the best possible documentary was about that period of history.  She thought a minute and replied \\"Schindler's List\\".<br />But this is no documentary.  It's a movie and a great one.  Liam Neeson portrays Schindler as a flawed, almost tragic character.  His inhumanity during the first part of the film toward the Jews comes back to haunt him later when he has a change of heart.  Meanwhile, the most memorable character in the movie is also the one who is so cruel and heartless, it almost chills the blood.<br />The Nazi's name is Amon Goeth and he is played by Ralph Fiennes.  No kidding, this may be one of the best acting jobs in history.  This character is the symbol of Hitler, who is not present in the film.  From standing on his terrace using Jews for target practice to viciously slapping a young Jewish girl he \\"loves\\", Fiennes delivers a character that allows us to see what the Nazi attitude really was.  Unlike Schindler, who transforms himself into a humanitarian, after seeing how horrible his attitude had been, Goeth never wises up, his last words in the movie being \\"Heil Hitler\\" before he is hanged.<br />This is not an easy film to watch.  It is rather long, at 3 hours and 17 minutes, but the time will pass so quickly, you will hardly realize it.  There is also quite a bit of violence, some of it so horrifying that you will have nightmares for a while if you have a weak stomach.  For some reason, this film has not made it to DVD yet.  I am sure it will at some point.  For now, we are forced to endure it on tape.  At least Spielberg finally gotsome recognition from the academy after the shameful way they disregarded him for the Color Purple<br />...  The movie never gets old or boring.  Without a doubt it is the best movie I have ever seen.  Some films are more enjoyable to watch (Citizen Kane, Shawshank Redemption) but no movie can match the power of this one.
B00001ZTFZ|5.0|sorry guys, i know many people dont like this album buut this album is truly great! all mega album and this one is as good as the other. the bonus track duke nukem ROCKS!
0385503954|5.0|Seldom do I find a book that is as intriguing as this one to just lose oneself in.  I was reminded of Jane Austen in the long descriptive passages that so clearly invoked the individual personalities of the characters.  Without going into any details of the plot (I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone), I would like to state that I was not entirely surprised by the ending.  The part that puzzled me the most, although I was grateful for the apparent accuracy, was Briony's experience as a student nurse and her performance when the soldiers arrived from Dunkirk.  Briony was imaginative and unpredictable.  Her behavior during the stern discipline and harsh reality of the hospital wards was not in keeping with her nature.  I found it difficult to believe that she could be so structured.  It was easy, however, to believe that she could not find the courage to admit the wrong she had committed against her dearest friends and relations.  As for the wrong itself, I think everyone was guilty--the adults for not questioning her more closely, the police for taking a child's testimony verbatim, Lola for not speaking the truth, painful as it might have been.  Briony was not the only one to seek atonement; she was surrounded by a conspiracy of silence.  Perhaps the theme is that there is no atonement, only the struggle to live with guilt.  In the end, MacEwan is writing about writers and, along the way, showing us how it is done.
B000006U44|5.0|I've yet to hear a Kate Bush album that I could not listen to, but this one tops all her other efforts. We get the keen balance of her beautifully loopy voice and her most moving songs. Beginning with, appropriately, &quot;Moving&quot; and drifting right into &quot;The Saxophone Song,&quot; an intense dreamy mode scoops you up immediately. Yeah, I know I'm going out on a histrionic limb here, but &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; can mellow and soothe me in record time! <br />Whether she belts out an eccentric &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; or a sweet &quot;Man With the Child In His Eyes,&quot; Kate Bush really hits the mark throughout this album. If you have never heard Kate Bush before, forget compilations and hold off on her other works; I think you will enjoy this particular CD immensely.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Radiohead's return with Hail To The Thief was a wonderful news for me and all the pure alternative music fans, this album is more than something, i believe Radiohead is the biggest alternative rock band existing in out planet, they have power to influence you with everything they want, they can surprise you with 2+2=5, they can make you dance with Punchup at A Wedding, they can shoot you to the sky with A Wolf At The Door or they can make you commit suicide with We Suck Young Blood. If you were satisfied with their amazing unique music style in Kid A and Amnesiac, this album is highly recommended, if not, well you can still listen to other albums, but i don't think they will return to that kind of style which in their opinion has nothing new,Hail to The Thief makes you Up and Down for an hour, after listening to it you don't wanna listen to anything else at all, they have made 2 brilliant videos for THERE THERE and GO TO SLEEP which are both worth watching, I loved this cd, and i wish i had the bonus DVD version if it was available. If you want to listen to this special genre music like Radiohead does, you can listen to some other bands like Sigur Rio, Massive Attack, Bjork, Portishead, Air. but keep listening to this fine piece of art. This album lives forever, Britney's cds duzn't!!
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck was definitely in a darker phase on this record than with &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; or &quot;Odelay&quot; but the results are just as good. This record, in a similar vain as &quot;Mutations&quot;, has Beck playing more mellow music. This album shows Beck's amazing ability to change his direction while still keeping listeners interested. This record is a bit sad and definitely moody but amazing none the less.
B000093NLH|5.0|This CD was quite a surprise --- actually, I shouldn't say that I was surprised because I find everything that the Scorpions do as wonderfully creative and entertaining.  This CD, however, really shows the Scorpions at their best in many respects.  They are indeed a rock band -- in my opinion, the BEST rock band -- but on this outing they prove that they don't need amps and power chords to get their message across.  What you get instead is pure Scorpions glory.  Songs such as \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Still Loving You\\" have been rearranged as total acoustic numbers and they are absolutely gorgeous.  I don't know that I will ever be able to listen to \\"Holiday\\" any other way from now on.  The band covers \\"Dust in the Wind\\" and they blow Kansas away -- which is really saying something.  The song literally brought tears to my eyes.<br />The music fabulously showcases the songwriting talents of Rudolf and Klaus and the fantastic musical abilities of the entire band.  The acoustic guitars are backed up by subtle drumming, a cellist, bass guitar and keyboards.  It is almost a cross between their \\"plugged\\" music and the Berlin Orchestra Concert.  Without the power normally generated through their amps, the Scorpions show us what they are all about -- good music.  These guys aren't just rockers -- they are first class musicians (obviously classically trained) and the melodies are entrancing.  I guarantee that true Scorpions fans will be almost moved to tears with the sheer beauty of the instruments \\"singing together\\" in perfect harmony.<br />I get upset reading reviews that say \\"the Scorpions went downhill\\" or they \\"sold old\\" and changed their style.  Those reviewers are not Scorpions fans -- they are fans of particular songs.  True Scorpions fans understand that these guys have music flowing through their veins and they have not pigeon-holed themselves into one specific genre.  They write from their hearts and play from their souls -- and that will understandably generate different types of music.  To love the BAND (rather than just a particular song style) is to understand what they are saying to you through their music -- and to respond back to them in turn.  I can't think of a single Scorpions song that I do not like on some level because I understand what they are trying to say with their music.  They are saying \\"Here I am .. this is me\\" and when they bare their souls like that, who could NOT be moved by it?
B0000AM6K2|5.0|Josh has done it again his new cd is fantastic,think early Hall and Oates (hey they are hip just listen to Essex Green)or Lambshops Nixon with more pop.This blanket will keep you warm the whole night throu.Just jump in your dads old volvo and put this one in the deck because this is AM-gold,and hey let pops come with you and he might recall those sweet baby james days
B000001FOL|4.0|This is the first Nico album I ever bought, and in many ways it is still my favorite. \\"Chelsea Girl\\" is a beautiful document of the sixties chanteuse married with the underworld. Think Marianne Faithfull as a sixties singer of hip pop melded with her wisened and world weary recordings of the late 70's and 80's. Nico sings a unique mix of ballads (the Jackson Browne/Gregory Copeland penned \\"The Fairest of the Seasons\\", along with Browne's \\"These Days\\" and \\"Somewhere There's A Feather\\") and VU detached character sketches (\\"Little Sister\\", <BR>\\"Chelsea Girls\\"). The subject matter ranges from youthful hope and poetic observations on life, to harrowing tales of overdose and sex fantasy. All this is conveyed without judgement or opinion. Nico's own detached persona is evident even on her earliest works.<BR>The Velvet Underground members Lou Reed, John Cale and Sterling Morrison provided a very strong presence on the recording. Writing five of the tracks in one form or another, with Nico also in on \\"It Was a Pleasure Then\\", the sound they created as a band is conveyed here, also. Cale's chamber arrangements on many tracks brings out the poetic optimism of the Browne tracks especially. \\"And do I really have a hand in my forgetting? Yes and the morning has me looking in your eyes and seeing mine\\". These are tracks that didn't really fit VU, but for Nico they seem perfect.   <BR>     The title track takes on the tales of exotic trysts that occured at the Chelsea Hotel. Here the girls were objects of the fantasies of men with very creative and demanding imaginations. Margaret in foil, dear Ondine, (\\"she wants to be...a human being\\". \\"Here they come now. See them run now. Chelsea Girls\\"). It is truly an amazing track, and at over seven minutes there's time for many wonderous tales.<BR>     I also like her version of Dylan's \\"I'll Keep It With Mine\\". A lyric that good is hard to go wrong with. The distanced Dylan was an early favorite figure in America for Nico (\\"She  looked like she walked out of 'La Dolce Vita'.\\"). The simple arrangement puts the emphasis on the words and nice melody.<BR>     The last two tracks together with \\"It was a Pleasure Then\\" feel much akin to each other for me. The hope of the Jackson Browne songs is gone. Instead, there is loss, morbid resolution, and sorrow. \\"Wrap your troubles in dreams/ Send them all away\\". \\"It was a Pleasure Then\\" leaves us with a soul dwelling over what once was, and the skeletal remains of what is left. <BR>The ending track, written by the great Tim Hardin, is an elegy to another influential figure for Nico. \\"Eulogy for Lenny Bruce\\" (not \\"Ballad of Lenny Brown\\" as Modernist in a post modernist world wrote it, at least look at what you're writing about, poser) is just that. \\"I've lost a friend and I don't know why. But never again will we get together to die\\". Hardin's own enslavement to the needle and the damage done by it fueled a kinship he felt with Bruce, along with his refusal to bend or sell-out to censors. I've listend to this song many times, and feel that it works in many ways for many people and points in life. Such subject matter, and the slow cadence of the album as a whole, may seem depressing or unattractive for some. I feel that these elements simply make it an adult recording with much to offer for those brave enough to give it a chance. <BR>Try \\"Chelsea Girl\\", then get \\"The Marble Index\\", Nico's greatest artistic work. This is beautiful art by an often misunderstood and dismissed artist.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The debut Ramones album reigns as my personal favorite, although all their other 70s recordings come in a close 2nd place. No doubt it's an \\"apples & oranges\\" call amongst any Ramones fans, but if this aging music fanboy were to try and introduce the Ramones legacy to some Blink182'd youngsters who never heard of these legends before their time, this is definitely the album I would point them toward. The music is raw yet catchy, and in my uneducated opinion best embodies The Ramones desire to play fun, energetic rock & roll with lyrics that carry no overbearing messages. <br />These songs have the innocent beat of early rock, but coarse, edgy and fun lyrics that were shocking for 1976. My personal favorite come from \\"Havana Affair,\\" \\"PT Boat On the Way To Havana/I Used to make my living, man,pickin' the bananas!\\" with a close 2nd place favorite being from \\"Judy Is a Punk:\\" \\"They both went down to Frisco/Joined the SLA/ Ohh I don't know why/Ohh I don't know why/Perhaps they'll die!\\" Any group who can take a tagline from the folk novelty \\"There Was an Old Lady\\" and modernize it into something all their own is A-OK by me! Dig into these songs, this album is solid from beginning to end.<br />The bonus tracks are plenty of fun for avid Ramones fans like me, but I'm not certain they 'll offer much for those who are just getting familiar with the group.<br />What do studied and accomplished musicians think of The Ramones? It doesn't matter; really, it doesn't. The Ramones made music that was fun, and you'd catch it in your head faster than a winter cold. Their music is the ultimate audio-adrenaline rush, and no matter your age or status,I highly recommend this particular CD in the morning along with a serious cup of coffee.....BLAST OFF! HEY-HO! LET'S GO!
B00005JKN9|5.0|Great take on little known history of NY during the Civil War.
B00005JKC3|4.0|it is not the worst movie ever.<br />If you're not too confused by actual character development, and if you can accept that the Hulk isn't real and won't look absolutely real, then you'll probably like it.<br />However, if you need your movies laid out in clear, pre-defined cliches drawn in crayola and aimed at the \\"Maxim\\" crowd, then just move along....
B000002J09|5.0|1971 was a great year for Led Zeppelin. They singlehandely made 4 great albums in a row. With this album, Led Zeppelin no longer played clubs, and was soon playing only arenas. Anyway, the music is very good, starting with an excellent opener, Black Dog. Fine riff by John Paul Jones. Rock and Roll is another great song, despite being used for a car commercial (UGH!). Battle of Evermore is a brilliant folk song with Sandy Denny singing on it (check out Fairport Convention, the band she's in). Stairway is overrated but it's an ok song nonetheless. Misty Mountain Hop and Four Sticks gets my vote for best songs on the album. Going To California is another nice folk song, extended live. When The Levee Breaks is perfect, with great drum production and a very trippy riff. It's a perfect closer to a classic record.
B000099T2L|5.0|Admittidly I was not the biggest Beyonce fan after the whole group break up thing but I HIGHLY recommed this CD to any real music lover... Jigga man must be doing her right because this CD damn near takes you through their whole relationship and she does it in a manner where we can all relate... THUMBS UP to u Beyonce and keep doing what you're doing because this is one of the few CDs where atleast 90% of it is good... the only song she could have kept is #4 (hip-Hop Star) but other than that its a hit! L8ta!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Even though it has already been said before in other reviews, I still feel compelled to add to the list of disappointed viewers, only to possibly dissuade any other Matrix fans from wasting their money on this movie.  I absolutely loved the Matrix, it was an incredible movie full of special effects, great fighting, some really weird stuff going on, and a freshly approached plotline to the age old \\"our world is dying\\" theme.  \\"Reloaded\\" has none of the above, with the exception of some good fighting that gets very old and boring after awhile.<br />There is a finite amount of Kung Fu maneuvers that can be done, and repeating them over and over and over and over does not make a fight scene a good fight scene.  What plot there was to this sequel could have been whipped out by the screenwriter's five year old between juice and bedtime.  So exactly what did I not like about it?  Waiting for two hours and twenty minutes and still not seeing the plot.  Waiting through fight after fight after fight with no originality added except Neo's ability to fly.  Wow.  He should have flown away from some of the fights sooner just to save me some of the time I wasted watching this.  The Zion/orgy and Neo/Trinity scene should have been left on the cutting room floor, along with the idealistic snooze-fest of a speech from a Morphius who has morphed from powerful, enigmatic leader to a boring fuss-pot of a wanna-be philosopher.  Yawn.  When all the Smith replicates kept coming, why didn't Neo fly away sooner?  If Neo has become \\"The One\\", why can't he read the Oracle better...<br />Sorry, I just could not find one thing to like about this sequel.  Some sequels are worth<br />watching (Star Wars, Alien, LoTR) and some are not. (Highlander, Predator, Matrix)  Please listen to others who gave negative reviews and articulate better than I do.  I wish I would have.
B00007LTIC|5.0|The color printing of the cd's booklet is quite innacurate , very intense but the body of the naked guy looks yellow on the side. Nothing like the LP<br />The cd itself is beautifuly pressed and designed. Pretty better than the japanese replica cd body.<br />On the other hand, the japanese replica's three fold is beautiful, with perfect color.  Did i tell you this japanese replicas have very painful mini sound drop-outs?  dont buy them, you are warned, just the package is perfect.<br />Returning to this rhino remasters  they are  the best ia have listened to. Really clean sound.<br />The bonus extra songs are only for very insistent yes- core fans. Some interesting passages, different soloing, etc. and some [weak] soundscapes  too.<br />Recommended only for real hard core fanatics or newcomers.  The 90's Gastwirt remasters sound pretty decent  for the casual fan.<br />A final comment: 1 star for the terrible art cover. 5 stars for the music. Musically, this CD is in m opinion in the top ten prog rock cd's ever. A gem for symphonic rock fans.
0800128052|5.0|So what's a guy to do?  He has no money, lousy high school grades, and zero size and athletic ability, yet his dream is to play football for the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.  Again, what to do?<br />Never give up on your dream.<br />Director David Anspaugh's wonderful RUDY is one of the most inspiring films I've ever seen.  Based on a true story, Rudy Ruettiger (played by Sean Astin, forever more known to me as Samwise Gamgee) is a blue collar kid with a stubborn streak as wide as the chip on his shoulder.  Rudy's family and high school teachers scoff at his dream of going to Notre Dame, yet the young man perseveres.  He enrolls at a junior college, applies again and again for admission to the university--applications that are subsequently denied--yet he perseveres.  With no place to live he befriends the head of the maintenance crew at the stadium (played wonderfully by Charles Dutton) and ultimately sleeps in the maintenance office, yet he perseveres.  And when he finally gets accepted to Notre Dame--when he walks on to the Fighting Irish's storied football program and gets the stuffing beat out him, day after day--he perseveres to the film's magical, magnificent ending, an ending that signifies his perseverance has paid off.<br />This is a &quot;feel good&quot; movie that will make you stand up and cheer.  With unwavering respect and detail to Notre Dame tradition, RUDY delivers an inspirational story guaranteed to put a lump in your throat.  In fact, by the time the movie is over I'm crying more than the day I was born--and I'm looking for a pair of shoulder pads to put on and a tackling dummy to obliterate.  Strong set 48 toss sweep:  let's go!<br />--D. Mikels
B000000IV0|5.0|OK, so you all know that Nirvana's NEVERMIND is a must have in your collection, but now a Gold Disc? Is it really all that worth it? Well...YES!<br />I got this early when it was less expensive, but if you can still manage to find it, at any price, GET IT! You'll be amazed at the clearity of sound on ANY CD player, plus it's even better on a SACD player (most DVD payers support it). Sure, it's not a &quot;TRUE&quot; SACD, but the lazers are thinner and more accurate... yadda-yadda-yadda...<br />I would, however, have to insist upon getting it new. It comes with a leaflet with a number on it, and a special card/sleeve that goes around the spine. I'm guessing that most people just throw that away.
0553573403|3.0|Martin's writing is excellent, as are his characters.  But I just can't get into a book with all the padding a lengthy series requires.  Some people just eat it up, though.  So, if really long series are your thing, then this is probably right up your alley.  But if you prefer book size books, then there's nothing here with enough originality to really suck you in.
0345457684|4.0|OK, this review is a bit of revisionist history.  Had I reviewed this book immediately after reading it, I probably would have emphasized it's strengths: the fine writing, the able characterisation, the superb visionary descriptions of his future Earth, and his fun assimilation of film noir into hard SF.  I also would have tossed in quite a few complaints about the derivative nature of some of his key plot points.  Without going into it with too much detail (and therefor saving the reader from spoilers) Morgan treads ground already covered (and covered better) by fellow UK writers Ken Macleod and Alastair Reynolds.  There's also a bit too much Blade Runner and Neuromancer here -- don't get me wrong, I love those seminal works.  Nevertheless, we've seen it all done before, and (to be repetitive) done better.<br />So... fast forward to today, and I firmly believe that this book is a must-read.  Why?  Because it sets up what is evidently going to become one of the most read and beloved future-universe space opera sagas of the decade.  I finished Morgan's sequel, Broken Angels, and let me tell you: it is fantastic.  It is as original as Altered Carbon is derivative.  The seemingly-throwaway lines in this book that so intrigued me come to glorious fruition in the sequel.  And as I know that this is supposed to be a review of Altered Carbon and not its unpublished (in the US) sequel, I'll just add that the new one is firmly well-written military SF, giving rise to the speculation that Morgan intends to mine the various sub-genres of SF, utilizing thier various strengths to advance what is obviously becoming an intensely spiritual story.<br />If you want to appreciate the masterpiece that is Morgan's new book, Altered Carbon is essential.  The author gives no quarter to the new reader unaquainted with the conceipts of his continuing universe, and you will be lost without it.  Plus, this is indeed one fine and entertaining read.<br />Check out Altered Carbon, and watch Richard K. Morgan become one of the bright shining stars in the already luminous UK SF scene.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Six Feet Under is a unique and interesting look at death.  Six Feet Under is better than a great majority of the shows on tv. Some say it's like a soap opera with it's progressive storyline and love interests.  But I say it's creating a new standard of tv.<BR>The first season was highly addictive for me. I give high kudos to the opening credits...amazing music and opening scenes. The cast is extremely talented and give captavating performance.  I am waiting every so patiently for the second season on be released on dvd.  <br />Provocative...enthralling...like I said...highly addictive.<br />For those of you who have never seen Six Feet Under I would like to recommend if possible to watch from the episode one and go from there.  The effect will be more massive. :)
B00005JKZV|5.0|Note: I love The Two Towers! I can't wait for the Return of the King!<br />I think those that are \\"Tolken Purists\\" are forgetting something important about these movies. You where entertained. Admit it. You loved the visuals even though not all of Tolken's orignal story was not compleatly played to the letter. You where still entertained.<br />I also see that you don't realise how many people worked soooo hard on this film to present it to you. If you get the extended DVD or at least rent it and take a look at some of the documentaries you will see the years of work. YEARS of hard work that went into this. PJ wasn't the only one to make decisions in plot line and edits. It isn't fair to blame him for your malcontent.<br />Bringing LOTR to life is no mean trick. It has been a labor of love for so many people for so long.<br />What have you done that you have poured your blood sweat and tears over for YEARS?<br />So what if it is missing or has changed a few things. At least these people dared to bring their love for this increadible story to life and presented it to all the world.<br />If you hate it so much, get some money together, get a cast & crew, have some studio back you and do it yourself.<br />I wonder if you could do better.<br />Till then Enjoy! Be Entertained! and Stop complaining about things you are unwilling to change!
068981528X|1.0|For a children's story this book is pretty average and boring.  For a parodied fairy tale it's also below average.  There are far higher quality both children's and adult fiction retelling of or in fairy tale format books out there.  Gary Larson's, There's a Hair in my Dirt! Would be my pick for the best fairy tale style children's book (adult's will love it too) and Once Upon a Crime would be my pick for the adult fiction readers.<br /><br />I really didn't like this book.  I think the author came up with a good idea of reversing the wolf and pig roles but obviously couldn't develop it further.  The artwork in the book is pretty average as well.<br /><br />Obvious situations don't happen in this book and aren't explained.  Why the wolves don't stand up for themselves or just call the police for one.  Why are other animals carrying around bricks, cement and other heavy building equipment while walking if they have no intention of using it themselves is another. Becasue you know I often carry around building materials when I go for a walk.<br /><br />The ending is terrible (don't worry I won't give it away) and very unrealistic.  Kids could be taught through the story how to deal with bullies or crime and other messages in this book if it was written properly.  Give this a miss.<br /><br />A great sequel to the original Three Little Pigs tale is the children's book [[ASIN:059062380X Porkenstein]]. In this tale the surviving pig from the house of bricks is a mad scientist and decides to make himself a friend.  Another great parody of the three little pigs is [[ASIN:0140544518 The True Story of the Three Little Pigs]]. Buy one of these instead.
1878424319|4.0|This book is a very easy-flowing book with simple vocabulary so that anybody can read this book.  For higher readers, it may sound a little redundant when you read it, but it's message is clear and simple.  Ruiz uses a lot of the same words in one paragraph.  But it is easy to understand his work.  He provides an adequate number of examples for each agreement you must make within yourself in order to reach happiness and clarity with yourself. These examples are simple and easy to relate to. Read this book and follow its directions and you will see a different side to the world as soon as you finish and apply its concepts into your world.
0375414932|4.0|I was not familiar with William Boyd's work and picked up this novel because it sounded intriguing.  It is an exceptional book, managing to be at once a moving personal story, a brief (and often funny) history of the arts and politics of the 20th century, and an examination of a society in decline.  The protagonist's meetings with historical characters, from Picasso and Hemingway to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, are surprisingly convincing and never seem like a \\"gimic.\\" I found the second half of the book somewhat less convincing than the first, and I got rather tired of the hero's obsession with his [physical] life, but all in all--a great read.  I will look for more William Boyd.
B000001XO3|5.0|This is a great recording. Someone is trying to sell it as a 'collectible' at a ridiculous price of two hundred dollars. Forget it. You can look around and find it - it's still available and its costs about a quarter of the ridiculous price that was quoted. Anything above seventy dollars is a riculous quote.<br />Everyone is in top form here.
B000002KNI|5.0|One word sums up this incredible disk: transcendent.  I use superlatives sparingly, but I haul out the big guns for this gem.  Phenomenal.  Puts the others to shame.  There are SO many things important and interesting about this disk, and I say this as a rather tepid Simon and Garfunkel fan.  First, this disk is required listening for anyone who wants to produce a live performance- the sound is great, the arrangements are flawless, and it's evident that EVERYBODY, even the guys \\"selling loose joints\\" in the audience, are have one HELL of a time.  My guess is that there are a million people who claim to have been in that crowd of maybe sixty thousand.  Isn't that a telling index of success? Second, the recording retains all the charm of the video- I watched it countless times back when cable was in its infancy and the indefatigable rebroadcasts of HBO were still considered a novelty, and it was a great show that the recording captures marvelously.  The only things you don't get from the music are the drips of sweat from the drummer and the shots of Paul and Art obviously enjoying each other's company for the first time in years.  I take that back- the recording adequately conveys that fact as well.  Thirdly, the performance maintains fidelity to the original intent of all the songs (as far as they are expressed on their albums) while also adding a great live interpretation:  so often \\"live\\" albums fail because good songs sound [weak] or they don't sound anything like them to begin with.<br />This recording bridges the generations of those who grew up listening to Simon and Garfunkel when their albums first came out, those who clapped along while their parents watched the concert on cable television, and the young kids who consider the seventies and eighties to be the middle ages of modern culture.  Simon and Garfunkel have appeal beyond their milieu, and this is their seminal gift to modern pop music.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like myself, many fans of this well-written, wise-cracking series were devastated when it was axed. Joss Whedon's show had vivacity and promise, from its concept to its production, and especially in Whedon's harmonic cast. Hopefully, the DVD will spark new life and interest into Serenity and her travels from one of the few bright producers or Network execs, and we'll see the show fly again.

B00005JM09|3.0|Following on from the last installment of the film series - James Cameron`s groundbreaking Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20`s living off the streets of present day LA - and a female Terminator called the T-X, or Terminatrix is sent back through time to kill John and also his future spouse Kate Brewster (a somewhat miscast and wooden Clare Danes, as her sole acting requirement appears to be to look frightened and scream). As before, a T-800 unit (Arnie) is also sent back to protect John....<br />Where do I start? As a standalone action piece, I enjoyed this film and thought it was great fun. Perhaps my expectations were set too high though when thinking of it as a `sequel` to the other parts - the setup is almost identical to T2 for one thing with basically the same story, just with a new, upgraded Terminator. This surely smacks of laziness.<br /><br />Brad Fiedel`s classic score, so synonomous with the two previous films in building up tension, is missing (though a new version of the famous theme is reprised at the end).<br />This film got a suprisingly lax 12A rating in Britain (compared to an R in the United States). It was perhaps due to a combination of all the killings happening offscreen and the lack of a recognisable, claustrophobic score (so we can know when the T-X is coming, for example) that made this film feel different. Where was the menace?<br />I never really got the feeling the T-X (a hot looking Kristanna Loken, who dresses in red leather) posed any real danger which was a shame - she lacks the cruel, sadistic nature of Robert Patrick in Terminator 2, or the `hunter` quality of Arnie in the first film, and of course looks like a catwalk model. The sort of person who would pout if you stole her Macy`s card.<br />This absence of impending doom or evil is no mean feat when you consider the main thrust of the film is about an approaching nuclear holocaust.<br />I liked the referential humour in this film though and there were some good jokes. Witness the gentle self parody of the scene where Arnie enters a strip club on `Ladies Night` - reaches into his leather jacket to put on his famous shades, and pulls out a pair of star shaped glasses Elton John would have worn in his 70`s heyday. Priceless.<br />There were some very good action scenes, including an unbelievable car chase that rivals a similar scene from The Matrix Reloaded, and some astounding effects.<br />The last act, and in particular the conclusion of the film, is brilliant. I won`t spoil the ending for you, but suffice to say it is remarkably downbeat for a Hollywood film, and more importantly remains true to the spirit of The Terminator franchise. Make no mistake, Jim Cameron`s ghost haunts this film, the ending recalling what he left behind.<br />Certainly not up to the standards of Cameron`s earlier classics in my opinion as its` less thought provoking and dark, but its` still a good film overall.there were some good jokes.

B00005JL78|2.0|I wanted to like Minority Report. I really did. The high concept was a movie-goers dream... \\"Police officer is condemned by the same faultless crime prevention system he supports.\\" The idea of Pre-Crime is excellent, well-thought out but still only expecting a modicum of suspension of disbelief. I want to see this movie for a quite a while and perhaps my expectations were a bit high. I wanted to see \\"Blade Runner\\" starring Tom Cruise and directed by Spielberg. Unfortunately, this movie falls far short....<br />To give the movie its due, I have to use SPOILERS so if you don't want to know, don't read on...<br />Still there? Okay, Tom Cruise's character is going to commit a murder according to the PreCogs (psychics of sorts) but it's a premeditated murder, meaning that there is time to hunt him down. Great idea, except Cruise literally doesn't even know who this person is until less than four minutes before he shoots him.<br />Colin Farrell is great in this picture and I wish there was more of him. Instead we have Tom Cruise and the loss of his son that he's been mourning. Which is fine; apparently no onscreen police officer has a happy home life. But when it comes time to discover who actually took Cruise's son, the ball is abruptly dropped and we're left hanging again.<br />There are plot devices used and then abandoned, leaving us shocked and without answers. Cruise goes through a lengthy, uncomfortable scene in which he has his eyes replaced (gack!). And even though he put away the black market doctor for hideous crimes before, there's no repercussions now. (Hunh? Why not?) The problem Cruise was fighting was the eyescan technology that kept detecting him around the city, but when he actually gets back to Police Headquarters, he has to use his own original eyes (conveniently in a Ziploc baggy, but unfortunately he drops them and has to chase them down the hallway...) The whole concept left me cold. What was the point of that whole episode except to waste another 30 minutes?<br />To top things off, the villain at the end had an excrutiatingly unclear motive as to why he'd go after Cruise's character. And while the PreCog division meets its unseemly demise at the end, there's no mention of the inevitable resumption of mass homicides. <br />For a movie that could have said a lot about motives and ambitions and how they are used and abused, instead we get MagLev chase scenes, jet-packs and Tom Cruise chasing his eyeballs down the hall.<br />Save your money and 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time.

And oh! was he right! I ended up reading the whole way while walking home! It is hilarious, it is sad, it is crazy, it is pure rock&amp;roll, and one of the best books about an unforgettable era in music. The way it is written, how the members remember things totally differently makes for great reading. And finally finding out more about the enigmatic Mick Mars, it all sums up to be The Great American Rock&amp;Roll Biography.
0465011012|5.0|I have read Aquariums several times and each time I think I have gained some new insight from it. It's not a deep work of insight so much as a very human true account of life in a terrible, terrible situation. It's also an invaluable aid to understanding North Korea and North Koreans, and the absolute hell that many of them have had to endure under the Kim dynasty. Honestly, Kang Chol Hwan and Soon Ok Lee (Eyes of the Tailless Beasts) are among the people on Earth who I most admire because people like them are definitely risking their lives to tell their stories. As Bush and company negotiate with North Korea on 'the nuclear issue' I can't help but think about the people in thse camps and pray that whatever deal occurs doesnt result in their mass murder.. all 200,000 of them.. Because they are only kept alive to be slaves till every last calorie is exhausted and Kim Jong Il doesnt want the world to know about the dark side of life in 'paradise'.<br />Kang is now one of the people behind the nkgulag.org organization..

B000021Y77|4.0|Have you ever had a dream where, perhaps you did not like the way the dream was evolving, so you manipulated the events in some sort of re-do/start-over variation, and tried again?  Well, this is 'Run Lola Run'...a heart-thumping, high adrenaline romp of a wild ride.<br />Lola is a young woman who is supposed to pick up her boyfriend, Manni, from the train station.  Manni - - who is kind of incompetent and obviously dependant on Lola for guidance - - works for criminal-types, and he was to make a delivery of 100,000 deutsche marks to his boss.  Due to circumstances beyond Lola's control, she is unable to pick up Manni at the designated time, and he, in his confusion, misplaces the bag which contains the money.  Manni is convinced that his boss will kill him if he doesn't have the money; Lola insists she can come up with the money, and Manni agrees to wait just twenty minutes for her, or else he will rob a large retail store nearby to get it.  The key here is the twenty minutes.  This frantic phone conversation sets everything in motion, and Lola's mad dash commences.  As the first twenty minutes winds down unsuccessfully, in that almost dream-like method, Lola is able to re-do the twenty minutes with similar but variant results, and then again a third time.  It is the variant results that make the scenes so fascinating.  Not only is this girl running with everything she's got, the director strafes you with fast-paced shots, and the pulsing techno-music feels like an aerobic workout in your brain.  Each person she comes across causes us to catch a small but interesting glimpse into the effects we all unknowingly have upon each other.  And, remarkably, for as little time you get with the lesser characters (her mother, father, people in the street), you are able to develop a much broader characterization and even a better understanding of who Lola is - - independent and confident.  <br />The only flaw in this story involves logic.  I couldn't help wondering why Lola just didn't go back and change the one thing that would've solved the whole situation - - get to the train station to pick up Manni on time!  But, all in all, I think 'Run Lola Run' is a very enjoyable film, and is visually pleasing as well as refreshingly original, story-wise.  I am just hoping it does not garner so much attention as to warrant an American copy, starring J-Lo!

B00008S2VG|5.0|Twenty years into her career the Material Girl still sets the pace.<BR>Last year marked the 20th anniversary of Madonna's debut single 'Everybody'. <BR>The former Ms Ciccone doesn't need to look very far to see her influence as a role model and fashion icon. Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and even Eminem may not bow down every night and thank Her Madge for paving the way for them but perhaps they should. <BR>With her imprint so deeply embedded in the DNA of pop it would be understandable if she decided to settle down with her hubby and kids, replay a few videos, remember the old times and relax. <BR>But American Life, a gloriously inventive, constantly surprising, deeply personal album, shows that rather than slowing down she's setting a pace that the young pretenders will be hard pushed to match.<BR>Production/writing partner Mirwais Ahmadzal has helped her create an audacious sonic landscape that matches cutting-edge cyber-dance techniques with prickly bruised guitars, gospel choruses, classical and operatic shading.<BR>Hollywood has a worldly-wise, funny lyric that skewers the shallowness of Tinseltown. The enthralling Nobody Knows Me is musically as imaginative as anything U2 or Radiohead have attempted.<BR>Religious references ( X-Static Process and the show stopping Mother and Father) run through the album. But even at her most serious and self-obsessed, Madonna never loses her sense of humour or feel for making life-affirming pop. She remains a colossus, with the competition left floundering in her wake.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|Fleetwood Mac released a Greatest Hits album in the late 1980s and a boxed set in 1993, so there was little more than a &quot;let's get into the act&quot; sense with this collection. Many classic artists are releasing two CD sets of their works, even some artists who already have a slew of greatest hits type compilations to their credit.<br />This set encompasses the work of Fleetwood Mac from their self-titled album of 1975 to their live reunion album The Dance, released in 1997. The only songs from any incarnation of the band besides the famous Rumours lineup are some easily-forgotten tunes from the days when Lindsey Buckingham left to explore his eccentricities. There are no songs from the pre-Buckingham Nicks days to speak of, no &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot; and certainly no &quot;Oh Well.&quot; That's where this set fails to impress.<br />Granted, there are some chestnuts here. &quot;Sisters Of The Moon&quot; is a forgotten jem of a song that just grabs your attention from the first listen. The original version of &quot;Silver Springs,&quot; a song that was previously relegated to the B-side of the &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; single, is also here. However, what ISN'T here is what takes center stage.<br />Of course, &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; deserves to be in a &quot;best of&quot; compilation. However, instead of putting in &quot;Big Love,&quot; and the Rumours version of &quot;Gold Dust Woman,&quot; the band should have used the live version of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; from The Dance video. Stevie Nicks's vocals are much more intense and angry in that live version, and would have added something great to this collection.<br />The first CD also has video of the band's recording of Say You Will, the first studio album with Lindsey Buckingham playing a key role since 1987's Tango In The Night. Unfortunately, not enough of that footage is there to warrant purchasing this set unless you're a completist.

6305090564|3.0|I found \\"Deep Rising\\" to be a fun sea monster movie that is sort of a cross between \\"Beyond The Poseidon Adventure\\" (the sequel to \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\") and \\"Aliens\\" only a little more goofy than either of those two films.<br />The three stars, Treat Williams as the captain of a fast moving boat hired by mercenaries on a secret mission, Famke Janssen as the beautiful pickpocket on-board a cruise ship, Kevin J. O'Connor as the panicky friend of Treat Williams and mechanic of Williams' boat, are all great, but the rest of the cast whom mostly make-up the team of stereotypically macho and obnoxious mercenaries are unlikable.<br />As for the story and action, I thought it was great until the last five or ten minutes which seems to be the point when the inevitable physics-defying action scenarios begin occurring, but the scenes before that are logical.<br />Also, I found the sea-monster to be excellent. It reminded me a lot of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu monster that shows-up as drawings on the covers of his books and I'm sure that's what must have inspired its creation.
B000002UB3|5.0|Despite the fact that the Beatles were literally falling apart and disjointed that they never really came together as a group while making this album, you wouldn't know it to listen to it.<br />Abbey Road represents the culmination of years of performing as a musical group and the crowning achievement of arguably the greatest musicians of the modern era.  <br />Virtually every track is a hit so I won't attempt here to mince words about what was good and what was not.  Abbey Road is the standard by which all other albums are judged and no serious music collection can be considered complete without it.
B000021XS0|2.0|Well,the guys managed to refrain their overplaying a little bit and focus on the songs, instead of their playing. That was a plus, and this album really shines.<br />On the other thand, they transfered all their traditional indulgence in playing to the lyrics, I mean, plot. It is confused, arrogant, boring, using some kind of language similar to English... Really obnoxious. And of course, LaBrie´s voice is still hard to bear.

It has for me.
B000007MVM|5.0|Great CD to sing along to. Ignore your previous conceptions about what music is and you will love this album (unless you're into death metal or something then this CD will be torture to you). But yeah anyways it's a really chill, mellowed out album with a lot of really catchy songs like \\"love you\\", \\"here I go\\", and \\"octopus\\". Even though his style is a lot different I enjoy listening to early Pink Floyd with Syd Barrett and his solo's even more than the later Floyd albums so in my opinion this CD kicks [butt].
B00005QZWI|5.0|I assume that most of the people who review this CD are either: musicians, composers or somehow related to the classical-music-world; Then I must use my talent to express what I think about this CD.<BR>I must say, the fisrt time I saw the movie: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, while other people were admiring how beautiful Rivendel looked and how scary the ringwraiths appeared on screen, I was being captivated by the music.  Some people take the music score for granted NOT knowing (not understanding) that the heart of the movie is the musical backgorund.  I enjoy listening the CD as much as I enjoy watching the movie. It's an amazing experience. Mr. Shore did an amazing job by creating a score that reflects the story so well that even without watching the movie you can still feel happiness, tension, sadness when listening to the CD.<BR>The orchestration is mind-blowing: every theme stands on its own. The use of choral voices in the music is a so powerful that at times it makes me overcharged with emotions...<BR>The use of the brass and the percussion in the Isengard theme is amazing! and the use of woodwinds to describe the hobbits is fantastic. Anyways, every piece of melody that is in this CD is filled with all kinds of emotion that will make you remember and experience the movie at times when you're not watching it. Mr. Shore deserved his Oscar for this piece of work...08/3/2003
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I have long enjoyed Neil Young, and have always found him to be one of rock and rolls most important figures. This collection of songs, woven around a singular story may prove to be his best collection of songs ever.

0062502174|1.0|I wasn't engaged by the main character or the theme of finding one's \\"personal legend,\\" which was preached at the reader more than revealed. The book also lacked plot, rhythm and imagery to stimulate the imagination. I cannot fathom the popularity of this book. It does play into the basic human desire to find one's destiny. But it contains muddled, inconsistent and even contradictory spiritual themes centered on tapping into a universal life source. I actually recommend reading the book, for it portrays an increasingly prevalent world view that I'm afraid is based on wishful thinking. Following one's heart to fulfill a personal destiny is desirable. But history provides ample evidence that man's heart - while having potential - has instrinsic flaws. Other books of spiritual wisdom, including the Bible, are willing to tackle this challenge. Coehlo attempts to address it when the main character has a conversation with his heart. But ultimately, the author skirts the tough questions raised by his philosophy. I believe the author also diminishes his point by driving it home again and again through character after character and circumstance upon circumstance. At least it was a quick read. The casual reader may find some food for thought. But anyone with discernment will see this book for what it is -- warm, fuzzy spirituality crafted to appeal to non-critical thinkers. Apparently, Coehlo is still searching for truth. That's great, and it's a lot more than many of us are doing. I just wish he had proceeded a little further before penning this work.

6305252521|5.0|This is certainly one of the bests movies out there. The story is compelling, the characters are believable, the camera angles increadibly interesting and the music is simply breathtaking. The fil shows us the story of a man living a boring fantasy of safety and routine, and how he tries to escape from it. This movie, i believe, is open to many interpretations, which is what makes it so interesting. In my opinion, this movie is about a very, very old story: The Garden of Eden. The set in which Truman lives is his own Eden, although he doesnt know so. However, as the movie develops, we see that in this version of the story, it's not God who kicks Adan out of Eden, rather than try to stop him from leaving at all cost. The film is about the human spirit, his nature and his power to change things.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Greendale, which received much press -- some positive, most negative -- prior to release is a welcome return to form for a great artist. The 1990s were, quite surprisingly after the paltry 1980s, some of Neil Young's most artistically and commercially fruitful years. However, after releasing several great records in the early 1990s, Young seemed to lose focus. 1996's Broken Arrow was a solid, if unspectacular Crazy Horse Jam; 2000's Silver & Gold was seen as a career-defining moment for some, but many, including me, find it overrated; 2001's Are You Passionate? was a new twist but something less than a great album.     Greendale, on the other hand, is very good, if not quite great -- far and away Young's best release since Sleeps With Angels. Now, let this be said -- Greendale consists of exactly what Young's critics claim his music always is: an old hippie lamenting about how bad things are and how much better they used to be. For better or worse, Young has always played by his own rules. Greendale, though perhaps the most ambitious album of his entire career -- with its convoluted concept, long songs (even for Young), and accompanying multimedia projects -- is very spare musically and very, very, underproduced. The tracks consist entirely of Young's guitar (long-time Crazy Horse guitarist/keyboardist Frank \\"Poncho\\" Sampedro does not even appear), Billy Talbot's bass, and Ralph Molina's usual inept drumming, occasionally punctuated by Young's harominca and on one song by his organ; the only other devices are a megaphone (you'll see) and a lone voice over. This may be a concept album, but it isn't Pink Floyd's The Wall. The songs are carried almost entirely by lyrics; this is a very wordy album. Though most songs are long, and a few quite long, instrumental sections are generally short. But let it be said -- the words are very powerful and moving. Despite the elaborately detailed world Young has created -- just see his Web site for a taste of its complexity --, oneneed not concern oneself with its specifics. It may concern the Green family, but the story is univeral. Young chronicles emotions and sentiments that probably all of us have experienced. I almost cried listening to this album for the first time; no doubt many will go all the way. It is a very moving, very touching, very empathetic album. Young rouses emotions and makes us truly feel for the characters. As omniscient narrator, he seems distinctly bitter, almost against his will; the liner notes apologize several times for it not being a happy story. Here we find a man railing against crass modern materialism; just listen to Grandpa's rants and Sun's idealistic actions. The ending comes quite unexpectedly -- but, as Young says several times in the liner notes and also mentioned in a recent interview, our only hope lies in youth.     The album, though highly compelling and immensely interesting, is nevertheless imperfect. Though the lyrics are some of Young's finest in years, the music, as mentioned is not as strong as it has customarily been. Also, Young's voice has changed significantly in the last several years; he puts much-needed emotion and empathy into several songs -- notably \\"Bandit,\\" the album's best cut and the only one that stands out from the concept --, but he sings much of the album in a lazy sing-song way that makes it sound as if he's only half-interested. Despite these imperfections, however, Greendale is a vibrant, interesting, and affecting album that is Young's best in many years and an essential purchase for any fan.
B000003TAR|5.0|Within a year of finishing this album, Kurt Cobain was gone. He was another troubled soul who found that success made a failure of his life. The fame generated by Nevermind made his existance hell. In Utero was an intentionally 'difficult' album, an attempt to shake off the mainstream end of the fanbase, people who liked Bon Jovi but not Husker Du.<br />When first released, the album had that effect, with the controversial lyrical subject matter of tracks like Milk It (with the now-ironic lyric \\"look on the bright side of suicide\\") and of course Rape Me, and people finding it heavy, dark and perhaps depressive. However, herein lies the genius - within a few listens the true emotion and intensity comes forward.<br />Milk It is in fact my favourite, wtih a heavy guitar riff well used and some challenging lyrics. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle is a smart understated piece, with \\"I miss the comfort in being sane\\" another insightful wordplay. Very Ape and Tourette's are great to let off steam - although its sad that so many chancers now seem to think an album of Tourette's clones is 'real music'.<br />Usually I don't like Nirvana's slower efforts, but its not hard to appreciate why All Apologies was so popular. The use of acoustic guitar coupled with the grinding chorus is one of the most emotionally affecting tracks they ever recorded, and suggests that the album after this would've been spectacular. Alas, that was never to happen.
6302824729|5.0|This was a lot better than the first.  I thought this installment  had a better plot than the first.  Martial arts master Miyagi and his student Daniel return in director John G. Avildsen's sequel to to the popular \\"The Karate Kid\\".  After their triumphant victory, Daniel and Miyagi continue their training focusing on the honor and disclipine  of karate and the deeper powers of meditation.  When Miyagi receives news that his father is near death, he and Daniel take off to the Island of Okinawa  where Miyagi's family lives.  Upon Miyagi's return to his homeland, he is reunited with his long- last childhood love Yukie.  Despite their youthful love for one another, Yukie was forced to marry Miyagi's rival, Sato in an arranged marriage causing Miyagi to flee Okinawa instead of fighting for the woman that he loved.  Now that his rival is a powerful karate expert and a rich, embittered landowner who demands a final grudge match with the wise and elderly Miyagi.  As Sato threatens Miyagi and his family, his nephew, Chozen is out to fight Daniel in a battle of young wills.  Both teacher and student are forced to stand up to their rivals in an action-packed climax.  The final fight aganist Daniel and Chozen is awesome.    The emotionally charged adventures of Daniel and Miyagi are set aganist the beauty and honor of old world Japan, instilling a rich sense of history into their mastery and understanding of   the ancient art of karate.  The rousing soundtrack includes the Oscar- winning hit, \\"Glory Of Love\\" by Peter Cetera.  This is an excellent film which is worth seeing more than once.
B000003TSP|4.0|Portishead had little to gain with this album. Their debut had been so successful that it shaped an entire musical style, and the whole landscape of a city. Their efforts to follow this were fraught, to the extent that almost an entire album was thrown away before they got this opne in the can.<br />All Mine and Only You are the most commercially palatable tracks on here, and 2 of the best. Beth is on top form vocally, a fact also borne out by the haunting Undenied. Only You brings the hip hop influence to the fore, sampling The Pharcyde to good effect and counter-balancing some of Beth's bleakest lyrics. All Mine's shimmering chorus is instantly memorable and balances well against the rest of the track.<br />Humming has to be seen as another standout, a six minute epic with builds from an eery intro to a passionate epochal climax. Anotehr favourite of mine is Western Eyes, which changes direction inexplicably at the end to provide a Portishead take on lounge, specifically the work of Shaun Atkins, described on the inlay as 'The Legend'.<br />However, in places the emphasis on atmospherics detracts a little form the tunes, and like any follow-up to an innovative debut, there is much less new ground to explore. I expect if you buy this first, you may end up preferring it, but I'd say Dummy stands above it.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Completely distorts the story of the first part. Raises a lot of questions and confuses the...out of a lot of people. But, the best part about Matrix 2 is that (just like the first movie) it could be seen by millions, but understood completely by few and that is worth every penny!
B00000ADG2|5.0|What else can I say about this album? For me it´s one of the best ever released by a R&B/Hip-Hop artist. After 5 years I still playing it at least once a week. Lauryn Hill wrote, produced every song in the album. <br />1.INTRO - I won´t rate the intro<br />2.LOST ONES (9/10)- Straight up hip-hop, I think Lauryn Hill is one of the best female MC´s, this song shows why. She don´t need to talk about her favorite designers or how she have sex with her man to make a good song.<br />3.EX-FACTOR (10/10)- One of my favorite songs ever. It´s funny how everybody can relate to it, and how everybody has different interpretations of what she´s talking about...<br />4.TO ZION (9/10)- featuring Carlos Santana - Beautiful song to her first born son Zion, she talks about how some people try to put pressure on her to have an abortion...<br />5.DOO WOP (THAT THING) (6/10)- I don´t really see why some people likes this song sooo much, it´s an ok song with a catchy chorus. I´m not feeling it much though<br />6.SUPERSTAR (7.5/10)- I like this song about fake superstars... I think there´s many singers (and rappers) out there that should listen to it.. \\"now tell me your philosophy on exactly what an artist should be, should they be someone with prosperity and no concept of reality\\"<br />7.FINAL HOUR (7/10)- Another straight up rap song, she talks about how we are all the same when our time comes \\"in the fianl hour\\" and money and fame won´t change it.<br />8.WHEN IT HURTS SO BAD (10/10)- My 3rd favorite song of the album. I like to call it Ex-Factor pt. 2, it has the same type of sound and (in my opinion) keeps talking about the same thing she was talking in Ex-Factor.<br />9.I USED TO LOVE HIM (10/10)- duet with Mary J. Blige. It´s my 2nd favorite song of the album (after Ex-Factor) Great lyrics and better vocals.<br />10.FORGIVE THEM FATHER (9/10)- Reagge type of sound. Lauryn talks about fake people, fake friends, and people that just wanna use you. \\"it took me a little whileto discover wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers...\\"<br />11.EVERY GHETTO, EVERY CITY (9/10)- Nostalgic song about her growing up, her teenager years, and looking back where you´re came from..<br />12.NOTHIN EVEN MATTERS (8/10)- featuring D´Angelo. Nice R&B song about being in love with your man, not caring about anything else..<br />13.EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING (10/10)- Lauryn gives a really positive message to the youth. Here she mixes successfully singing and rapping in the same song. <br />14.THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL (8/10)- The song that gives name to the album. It´s a good end. Nice piano introduction and great vocals.<br />--------------------------------------------------------<BR>BONUS TRACKS:<br />15. CAN´T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU (10/10)- Yall probably know this song already. It´s not hers but I give her a 10 out of 10 because of the production and her voice. <br />16.TELL HIM (9/10) - Inspired by the Bible text called 1st Corinthians. Good message \\"let me be patient, let me be kind, make me unselfish, without being blind, though I may suffer, I´ll envy not\\"<br />***CONCLUSION***<BR>This album is a must have in any cd collection.
0316666343|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!!<BR>I love reading, and it has been such a long time since I have found a book that just grabbed me from the first page on. Well this book has done it. I read the whole book in 3 days with such delight, absolutely wonderful!!!<BR>I love new authors, they write with such passion and clerity, and Mrs. Sebold has done just that. <BR>Trust me, from a women who loves a good book, this is a definite read!!!
0156027321|5.0|Not really about religion even though it is billed as such; more about the serendipity of life and man's will to survive. It does give some interesting perspectives on zoo animals, the nature of animals, and man's relationship with animals. It is also a story of the human drama that makes you think about what's important in life and how incredible life can be.
0451196716|4.0|This is an excellent book of King and probably the best he's written as Richard Bachman. The flow of the book is perfect, the characters are extremely real and likeable but the scare factor isn't there. Yes, its shocking and weird but not scary like most horror books. If you want a good scare I'd recommend Blood Crazy by Simon Clark or Darker Than Night by Owl Goingback. You don't get much scarier than this.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Peter Jackson's colossal film of the middle story of Tolkein's trilogy FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (New Line) is a critical and financial hit. Here, the scattered Fellowship fights Saruman's massive Uruk-Hai armies, while Frodo and Sam trek to the evil kingdom of Mordor to destroy the Ring. The Hobbits' visceral and moral adventure in resisting the seductive lure of surrendering one's soul for unlimited power resonates. As with the first installment, an extended version in a four-disc set will be available November 18.
B000002H8F|5.0|Yes, that description really is the only way I can do Bossanova justice. And just like previous efforts Surfer Rosa and Doolittle, this album is absolutely brilliant, even if it's a bit slickly produced for my taste.<br />Black Francis' twisted lyrics about incest and injury have been replaced by rather spacier, surfier stuff. No worries--Bossanova is still full of the trademark Pixies weirdness and the same brilliant use of quiet/loud dynamics (for a prime example listen to the explosive Down At The Well). After all, no other band could make a song as insane as Rock Music, especially preceded by the surf instrumental Cecilia Ann.<br />Joey Santiago's guitar playing is still wild and trebly, if a bit more melodic than before. Check out the neat, Talking Heads-esque riffs on Dig For Fire. Kim Deal contributes less than before unfortunately, but her backing vocals are put to good use here.<br />Every song is strong, but of special note are the brilliant epics All Over The World and The Happening. The latter is especially cool, weaving a haunting tale of aliens, Area 51, Las Vegas, and mass pilgrimage throughout its four minute run time. The last verse is delivered in an enchanting Shakespearean sonnet style. It might just be my favorite Pixies song of all time. Maybe...next to Where Is My Mind, River Euphrates, Tame, I Bleed, Monkey Gone To Heaven, Velouria, etc. etc. etc...I digress.<br />Don't believe the naysayers who say this is inferior to Surfer Rosa or Doolittle--Bossanova is EVERY bit as worthy. It is the last perfect Pixies album. The fourth (and final) album Trompe Le Monde is still very good, but lacks the consistency of previous releases. Overall Bossanova is a perfectly executed indie pop album, and essential to a true Pixies fan.
B00005JKHN|4.0|Disney's 1959 groundbreaking, animated epic production SLEEPING BEAUTY Special Edition, the first animated feature drawn and photographed in a widescreen format (70mm Technirama), finally arrives on DVD in a glorious, fully-restored two-disc edition with superb, re-mixed surround sound and a wealth of extras.  It's the 14th Century and evil queen Malificent curses Aurora, the king's infant daughter, taking away her happily-ever-after. Or so it would seem.<br />The brilliant interpretation of Tchaikovsky's ballet score and the distinctive medieval-inspired art of Eyvind Earle's detailed, pastel-hued, vertical-horizontal compositions, make this timeless romance -- based on a folk tale that arose after the Dark Ages (and a metaphor for the times?) -- a must-have for the digital family library and a masterpiece of animators' art.  Hold on to your dreams.  True love conquers all.  Available for a limited time.
B0000636UN|4.0|This album is very good. I like almost each song. This album is the second best Sheryl Crow album.
B00005JLSE|3.0|Based loosely on real events of the 1920s, the plot of CHICAGO (Miramax) has seen several previous incarnations. This Oscar© winning musical, a caustic, cynical comment on how we celebrate people who do bad things, mirrors today's headlines. It's murder, greed, debauchery -- everything we hold dear to our hearts.
B00006IUL6|4.0|I don't know anyone who can fall asleep to this fantastic film. Al Pacino, one of the most well known actors stars in Insomnia with Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Takes place in Alaska, a writer, Walter Finch (Robin Williams) murders a young girl. Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) who killed a fellow detective, who is sleep-deprived tracks Finch down as well as Hilary Swank tracks down Dormer. This dvd has many bonus features. A fantastic movie. From the director of Memento, Christopher Nolan.
B00003CXTG|4.0|People rag on this movie way too much.  In spite of the cheesy dialogue, the movie is surprisingly pretty engaging.  That is a sign that there are alot of good things going for it.  The script does have its (very few) moments.  The acting is good for the most part, and of course the action and special effects are outstanding.  But I do agree that the movie seems to be trying way too hard to be emotional and moving.  Alot of unnecessary scenes are in this movie just to make the characters look cool (like slow-motion exits from planes through smoke...with a flag in the background...i mean...come on).  Of course I was hoping this movie was going to be a great oscar contending war movie or something.  But, the movie was made by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer...I accept it for what it is...a solid action movie.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This movie is one of the great classics of animation, especially for Disney.  The DVD version is significantly improved compared to the previous VHS tape.  The picture and sound were both greatly enhanced for this release.  Furthermore, both widescreen and full screen versions are available in this package.<br />As with Disney's other classics, some liberties were taken with the original story of Sleeping Beauty.  Disney took the classic story and made it unique and special.  In some ways the story is less violent and dark than the original fairy tale.  In other ways, such as the portrayal of Maleficent, the movie is dark and forbidding.  While the movie is generally a children's movie, Maleficent's dragon and her general demeanor can be somewhat frightening for some in the pre-school and younger set.<br />Aurora was the first love for many a young boy, and was also the model for the aspirations of millions of girls.  The romantic love story of Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip enchanted would-be princesses everywhere, and in some cases became the measure by which future spouses were measured (and many of us struggled to meet the ideal).<br />Of course, the romantic story and the evil of Maleficent were balanced by the comedy of the animal characters and the three bumbling, good-hearted fairy godmothers.  While their goodness may appear a bit too vanilla and sweet for some, it is perfect for those longing for the innocence of their youth.<br />While the movie is the most important part of the DVD, this two CD set contains a phenomenal number of extras.  I found the audio commentary by various key individuals to be absolutely fascinating.  I planned to listen to portions of the commentary in preparation for my review, and instead found myself listening to the entire thing because it was so incredibly fascinating.  Mary Costa (Princess Aurora) and others provide their perspective on the creation of the movie, as well as personal memories of Walt Disney and his influence on the film.  The audio commentary by itself is worth replacing your VHS tape, particularly for aficionados of Disney movies.<br />In addition to the audio commentary are numerous, emphasize numerous, other bonus features.  Some I felt were less than worthwhile, others, such as the shorts \\"Grand Canyon\\" and \\"The Peter Tchaikovsky Story,\\" were excellent bonuses.  The number of bonuses on this two disc set was so large that there is a navigational overview included in the DVD that categorizes 38 features found on the second disc.<br />With the movie and the wealth of bonuses, this movie is a must-buy for those who have yet to have \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\"  For those who have the VHS, the bonus material is nearly worth the cost of the DVD.  Certainly those who are collectors of Disney memorabilia and historians of Disney will find the DVD to be a concise compendium of some of the best information available regarding this film.  I highly recommend this DVD!nce on the film.

B000003CMB|5.0|This album is so hot, it would make the Devil jealous.  In the late '60s and early '70s, the pop/rock music scene discovered it wasn't limited to 2-1/2 minutes per song.  A lot of European bands did the Progressive Rock gig.  Genesis, Yes, ELP and others produced synthesizer heavy, very controlled fusion of classical music and rock/blues.  We Americans had the JAM session:  free form improvizational blues and rock.  This album is one of the finest examples of extended improvizational blues and one of the finest live albums ever.  At times, it is soft and saucy relying on Duane Allman's guitar, at other times, it is hard rolling highway music driven by the drums and bass.  A great and essential album.  \\"Lord have mercy!\\"<br />If you have a good surround system, preferably with well matched full range speakers, buy the DTS version.  While I am not totally happy with the mix-down engineer's choice of where to place the instruments (the lead guitar shouldn't be in the left rear channel), and I would like a two channel mix, all music, particularly of this quality, deserves better than the CD format.  CDs are harsh, brittle, synthetic, unnatural sounding and induce listener fatigue in minutes.  The DTS version returns all the richness of the original recording.  Sit back and enjoy!
0345440900|5.0|This book had my son sleeping through the night inside of one week!  Furthermore, it made my days more livable.  Gone is the incessant crying, as I now understand his needs based on his type of cry and at what point he is in his schedule.  Don't be turned off by the word &quot;schedule&quot;, it is a very flexible one.  New mothers or soon to be mothers:  get this book now!
B00008G9JO|5.0|I've been a Tull fan since the early 1970s. This album and _Songs from the Wood_ are two of my all-time favorites, not only by Tull, but by anybody at all. Naturally, then, I was eager to hear the &quot;remastered&quot; versions.<br />Wow.<br />I don't have anything new to say about the album itself; I reviewed it some time ago in one of its earlier CD releases. But I have to comment on the quality of this new release. As with its companion _SftW_, there's a wealth of sonic detail here that I haven't heard in a quarter of a century. If this is on your own favorite-Tulls list, the remastered version will blow you away.<br />(It doesn't hurt that this is Tull's dream lineup, either. In fact, since John Glascock is my favorite Tull bassist, I expected that the remastering job would bring out some of the nuances in his performance -- as of course it does. But do you know who really benefited? Barrie Barlow. My word, I knew this album included some of his finest work, but wait until you _hear_ the detail here.)<br />'Nuff said. If you're thinking about picking this one up, ignore all the silly comments hereabouts and grab it at once.
B00004XPQ2|4.0|The jungles and mountainpeaks, rivers and animals make this a cinematic masterpiece. I would love to visit Ceylon but of course not during war. Its beauty is just absolute. The picture's story was also quite good. The overall theme to me was is there honor in wartime. To we become quite human and do what we can to survive or do we cling to the rules and stay soldiers to the end. In the movie Alec Guiness plays the rule oriented Major caught in a prison camp being told to build a bridge with his other subordinates, should he keep up the farce and play Major or leader until they are freed, following the rules no matter if it kills him. William Holden who is one of the subordinates disagrees, one other sees his point. Guiness becomes obsessed with his leadership and the bridge is his projection of obsession and his eventual demise. A stunning visual feast. Ceylon is and should be a dream come true not a place for negative energy to florish.<BR>Lisa Nary
B00009P1O0|5.0|If you're a fan of Neil Young, you've probably been waiting for this album to be available on CD for just as long as I have, and you certainly don't need me to tell you it's one of his best. Well, here it is, and it's every bit as good as you remember.<br />This album and its companions took some critical hits at the time of their releases because so much of the world wanted Neil to keep releasing _Harvest_ again and again. But as he wrote in his liner notes for _Decade_, when he found himself in the middle of the road with &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, he got so bored he headed straight for the ditch. He might have added that that's where he wrote some of his best stuff.<br />I used to have this on eight-track[!]; I haven't heard it in at least fifteen years and I still found myself singing along with it from memory. The lovely &quot;See the Sky About to Rain&quot; is worth the (unusually low) price of the entire CD, and &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; is another of my favorites. But this is just a great, great album from beginning to end.<br />Too bad it took so long, but it was worth the wait. Thanks, Neil.
B0000AI44Q|1.0|I've really liked a lot of Young's (fairly) recent albums, such as Ragged Glory and Harvest Moon, but this thing is bloody awful-- standard Young noodling that never quite turns into a Neil Young song, nearly all of it to the same monotonous drumbeat, several examples of it running as long as 13 minutes, over which he speaks-- improvises?-- some lyrics aimed at painfully obvious social topics like TV news, that hit more than a few moments of Spinal Tap-level inappropriate hilarity.  By the time he starts singing through a megaphone, as if he were Ken Nordine's alter ego, it's hard not to think this is the followup to Trans.  Bummer.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not since Dark Side of the Moon have I heard such a rich, sprawing masterpiece of sound and depth. OK Computer is a poetic and raw experience, pure and simple. Beautiful in its unconventional and lush melodies, dark and sad in the most interesting and provocative way. Listening to OK Computer is like hearing music again for the first time. &quot;Exit Music&quot; astonishes me everytime...I always have to stop in my tracks and just absorb it.<br />As for Duran Duran, well hey I like them too, but come on let's be realistic here...
B000002KDX|5.0|This is an outstanding album! It was a huge hit in 1972, spent five weeks at number 1 on the album charts, and went PLATINUM in the days when few albums did. While some of the lyrics may be trite (most of the songs were written while they were teenagers) the music is GREAT! If you love acoustic guitars, this album is a must. It includes their first number 1 hit single, Horse With No Name and another big hit I Need You. Several other songs received significant airplay on stations including Three Roses, Sandman, and Never Found The Time. The only weak song on the album is Pigeon Song.  Highly recommended if you like acoustic guitar music!
B00005JLRT|3.0|As a ST fan I cannot bad mouth much of anything, but I will say that this movie disappointed me.  I felt I was watching Wrath of Khan all over again since the story seemed to be very similar.  The whole Data story line was weak, and not well thought out.  The characters should've been given better development, particularly Dr. Crusher, since this will likely be the end for the Next Gen.
6305212112|4.0|Well written and well acted this is a compelling story that runs a wide range of emotions. Actually it is two stories; the current story of a women in mid life crisis and the story of the 1930s restaurnt and the people involved in it. So what you get are flashbacks that actually make up half the movie. As the show progresses each story fuses together in many ways. This is also a classic good vs evil yarn in which good does triumph but not all the time. Like all good movies it will make you think a little more about life; past and the shape of the present. <br />Now the negative stuff. Frankly i'm quite amazed that nobody seems to notice this or to have a problem with it. This is the ultimate politically correct movie. All PC issues are right there front and center. Feminism, race, lesbianism. Obviously that is at the core of the message. Despite all this nice textured story line is this rather simpleton, superfical message. White men are stupid and evil and one actually eats human flesh and likes it. All the women in the film are heroic as are the black men. When a young women dies it is a black women who stays by her side. No men in sight. The evil klan makes an appearence and the young women's husband beat her and had the klan steal the baby. Also at her side is her life long friend and business partner who has been romantically in love with her for a long time. White males are mean to blacks. White males beat and steal from women. White males steal children, kathey bates character has a husband who is lazy and uncaring etc. You get the idea. The handling of race in the movie goes is almost condescending as if to tell the viewer that blacks are people too. Gee thanks. Great story but too agenda driven and too condescending for 1990s america.<br />.................socks
B00005JKEZ|5.0|\\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" starring Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, and Claude Rains is possibly the best swashbuckler ever made--if not the best--and it was made at a time when almost everything its star, leading lady, director, and studio made was blessed with a golden touch.<BR>    Everything about this film was top-notch.  Curtiz was the best action man at Warners.  Flynn was at his dashing best.  The music was made by Erich Wolfgang Korngold ('nuff said) and every bit player at the Warner lot did their best work--especially Alan Hale and Eugene Palette--that might be a mis-spelling.<BR>    The color and the costumes come togehter in such a way that the film resembles many of the full color pictures one might find in an old picture book--this is especially true of the fight between Robin and Little John when they meet on the log.  Note how the camera pulls back and you see the sweep of the action--and this in the days before Cinemascope!  And if some see the film as old fashioned and without some relevant characters for the current audience--as they tried to do with the dreaded Kevin Costner vehicle--well too bad.  \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" remains a classic of its type and well worth the price of a special edition and, trust me, worthy of your time and trouble waiting for it!  Thank you Warners.  Now, how about \\"The Sea Hawk\\" and (especially) \\"Captain Blood\\"!!!
0316666343|5.0|You will either LOVE this book or HATE it. My mom and I loved it while my sister couldn't get past the first chapter. I recommend you continue to read. The book is imaginative, intriguing, and thought provoking. Alice Sebold takes her reader to places in the heart, soul, and spirit that no one has ever explored. Keep reading it, it won't let you down. And you'll have a hard time putting it down once you are hooked!
B00009M6VJ|2.0|This film really isn't as clever as it would like to be.  Most of the performances are disappointing and the dialogue has no subtlety which makes it almost insulting to its audience's intelligence.   Plus, the multiple plot twists at the end seem unoriginal now that the trend is so overused.  <br />This film could have had some real surprises and raised some real questions.  It should have been much better.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I'll make this clear from the start; I wasn't the hugest fan of the original Matrix movie. I thought it had good (but not great) action and a plot that sunk like a stone. As a result, I was fairly surprised to find that this installment was very well done and easy to watch, despite having several overly wordy and meaningless scenes like the first one did.<br />The movie chronicles the continuing adventures of a group of human rebels fighting to free the human race from the shackles of mental and physical imprisonment. One of the obligations of any sequel is that it ramp up what came before it, and this one does that in spades. The original bullet time fight scenes were impressive on their own; this time we're treated to such spectacles as hundreds of copies of a bad guy throwing themselves at one super-powered human, or an amazing freeway chase that runs about 15 minutes but only feels like 5 because it's so exciting. Action fans (especially martial arts fans) won't be disappointed here.<br />Though the plot is ignorable at best, the Wachowskis have successfully topped the original in about every way possible. Highly recommended.
B00009V7P8|4.0|With this debut, Damien Rice has created the                      most beautiful album we've heard this year. In                    fact, we have been so enchanted with the sound                    of this cd each time we have listened to it, we                   have plum forgotten to pay attention to the                      words. We have noticed, however, the complex,                     stately melodies, the shortest clocking in at over                four and a half minutes; the lush strings,                        glistening acoustic guitar, and striking                         arrangements; the haunting and shadowy                          back-up (and occasional lead) vocals of Lisa                      Hannigan; and, most of all, the arrestingly agile,                evocative and, off-times, riveting vocal                         performances of Damien Rice. Good lyrics would                    probably be overkill. (Nevertheless, we're                        determined to remember to listen next time). The                  album climaxes with a majesterial operatic                        performance by Doreen Curran inserted into the                    extraordinarily moving 'Eskimo'. It is a daring and              stunningly successful gambit by producer Rice                     and indicative of an innovative and exciting new                  artist.

B00008D1NF|4.0|Here is our foreign language album                          recommendation of the current season. All 3                       artists are familiar and important names in                       Brazilian music and their collaboration here is a                treat. A mix of Brazilian styles and rhythms, most                of it of a sensuously soothing nature. Marisa                     Monte's voice resembles the honeyed texture of                   Tracy Thorn (Everything But the Girl) or Julia                    Fordham. Arnaldo Artunes sounds like a Brazilian Serge Gainsbourg (who in turn sounds like a French Leonard Cohen). And Carlinhos   Brown, in addition to providing lovely vocals,                    plays a Scrabble game bonanza of delightful                       sounding instruments (mostly percussive, we                       surmise) from the 'afuxe' to the 'zarbre'. Their                  voices blend together to create music as pretty                   and colorful as the psychedelic collage of guitar                 picks 'depickeded' on the inside jacket of the cd.
B000001FI7|2.0|Portishead might be better if Beth's vocals weren't so irritating.  Listening to the shrill vocals on this CD makes you want to reach over to the stereo and throw the CD out of the window.<br />Massive Attack is infinitely better than their Kmart imitators Portishead.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great show, interesting plot.  I honestly wondered if I'd like it when I first watched Firefly.  After seeing it, I couldn't get enough....still can't, thanks to FOX's shortsightedness!  It's amazing how a network can manage to lose so many of their few good shows so quickly.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I've personally never seen a Ben Affleck movie before this one, and my fiancee refused on the grounds of his unusual popularity with the ladies (he's not THAT good looking.)  <BR>However, I am a fan of comic book heros, and not having read Daredevil, the premise intrigued me.  The basic concept is that when he was young, his eyes were damaged, but by a radioactive material, and he was blinded.  However, in its place his hearing is greatly improved, and he is still able to &quot;see.&quot;  For exactly how, watch the movie, no spoilers here, but I was impressed with the director's vision, no pun intended.<BR>I bought it, not knowing my fiancee's dislike of Mr. Affleck, and after some trouble persuaded her to watch it.  We both came out at the end thinking the movie had been really good, but also surprised at some of the twists and turns the movie takes you from.  I could easily see this movie in the &quot;tear-jerker&quot; category.<br />All in all this wasn't the absolute BEST movie I've ever seen, but the director and actors put enough heart into a good script that it was worth both my time and my money.
0060926317|3.0|I give this book a lower rating because of the poor writing it contains.  I do reccomend the book because it will give most people a very different perspective on a lot of things in our world.  I am glad that I read it.<br />This book tells a very sad tale about a primitive culture that is close to being lost from this planet with very little to record its existence.  They feel that modern society has caused their downfall (which it may have in many ways) and that there is no longer a place for them in this world.  While this society is very primitive when compared to our standards, I believe that there is a lot that we could learn from their way of life.<br />I think that this book brings up very important issues dealing with society today.  While I am not a &quot;hippy&quot; or much of an environmentalist, I do believe that people have very screwy perception of what life is all about and what will bring them happiness.  I feel that society has fallen away from spirituality and from concern for nature that we possessed in the past.  I think that the Abos belief in life and in living in nature actually makes good sense.  I believe that people would be much happier living among nature, and allowing nature to provide for us than we would competing among ourselves and restricting our lives to cities and highways.<br />I am not sure how realistic it is for me to hope for a change in society that would transform it so drastically from what it currently is.  However, I do think that people REALLY need to seriously consider the consequences that our actions may have on the environment and life in the future.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House is a classic that should be part of your collection!<br />This edition features remastered digital video over the DVD collectors<BR>edition, in addition to the sound being modified to 5.1 surround.<br />I had NO problem fast-forwarding through the previews at the<BR>beginning of the disc that others reviews were complaining about as being \\"locked in.\\"<br />If you own any previous DVD release of this movie this edition is worth the upgrade because of the improved video and sound!
B00003CXAA|5.0|Everyone thinks that I am just a little bit odd when they find out that I am into Mafia movies. I do not care about that, however. I know what I like and I like these movies. They really show you what being in the mafia is like and how dangerous it is. I could sit and watch them over and over again. You do not feel cheated when you watch these movies.
0446310786|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book (and I am an avid reader) for SOOO many reasons.  To Kill a Mockingbird opens the readers eyes to a whole new world.  Many books express racial oppression and attitudes towards it, and how to do what is morally right, but this book takes on a whole new perspective.  Writing it through a child's eyes is an ingenius way to tell this tale.  The characters are incredibly real and heartfelt.  The entire story is gripping, and I can never put the book down.  I've read it so many times I had to get a new one just so I could still read it.  I LOVE THIS BOOK!  I think you will too!
B00005JKC3|5.0|Finally, Ang Lee protects the legacy of the Marvel Comics character by creating a film that is thought-provoking and intelligent, in place of the usual \\"scateboard culture\\" action films that are aimed at selling CD's more than they are created to respect the legacy they should represent.<br />  The Hulk is a serious film.  I dare say, it really isn't for kids or for those who enjoyed Spiderman.  This is a very different film that is reminiscent of the old Sci-Fi/Adventure films in the seventies.  Lee takes his time with the characters and works wonders at portraying their strengths and frailties.<br />  The special effects are absolutely amazing and the acting is as good as it gets.  Eric Bana explodes on the screen as the young Bruce Banner and Sam Elliot is born to play Thunderbolt Ross.  Sure, the film starts off a bit slow, but it has to in order to build a good plot and storyline.  You believe in the characters and practically believe the green giant is actually being portrayed by a living being, as the effects are so detailed and realistic.<br />  I give this film two enthusiastic \\"thumbs up\\"!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Lets see how can I explain it GREAT, EXELENT, AWSOME, AND MANY MORE.  This is defenitly the greatest Cd i have right now its almost if not as good as the movie.  Actores depend on the music and music depends on the actores and when they do work together you get a good movie and sondtrack.  This movie is worth every cent.
B000089J0R|3.0|Dragonforce is an amazing band. Not one of their member is not a phenomenally skilled and talented musician. Don't bother with this album, though. Buy their 5-song demo, also titled Valley Of The Damned. It blows this album out of the water. Frankly, I was very excited to get this cd because usually demos are just that, demonstrations in preparation of what the real thing will be. Not so. The musicianship is still topnotch (with the exception of Starfire), but the mixing quality is terrible and not even consistent.<br />The title track, Valley Of The Damned, is so poorly mixed I actually winced. The demo version is the pinnacle of perfection as an example of what power metal should be. This recording is so badly mixed it hurt. The guitars overpower everything, the drums and bass are not audible and the vocals can barely be heard.<br />Black Fire, a new song, is excellent and mixed much better than the previous track, but the lyrics are derivative of Revelations. It is a good song, but not enough to save this album. Let's move on...<br />Black Winter Night is one of my favorite songs off the demo cd, but this version was poorly conceived and I'm not sure it can even really be called the same song. Only the intro, a portion of the verse and the breakdown are even the same. The chorus is entirely new; new song structure, new lyrics, etc. And it doesn't work. They turned what was an amazing song into a song that doesn't gel well, at all. If I hadn't heard the original version, I could have forgiven it but this just doesn't work.<br />Starfire, well let's just say they shouldn't even have bothered. The musician is not up to par, and it's played at a slower tempo than the original which, while not necessarily bad, ruins this. It almost feels as if the band was asleep while recording it.<br />Disciples of Babylon suffers somewhat from mixing problems, but overall is still excellent. There was some reworking of the song structure and lyrics, but the song remains rocking.<br />Revelations suffers from mixing problems, though strangely the instrumentation is mixed perfectly, the lead vocals are far too low in the mix and the backing vocals are at the proper level...that is if the lead vocals had been mixed properly. As it is, they drown out the leads. The song is still amazing, however. The plus to this recording of the song is that the keys are much more distinguishable in the mix than on the demo.<br />Evening Star, another new song, almost makes me feel like I can forget the faults this album has. The song is perfect. The mixing is near perfect. The dueling guitar solos, common to most every Dragonforce song, rise to a new level of musical skill. This is by far the shining jewel of the album.<br />Heart Of A Dragon, the last track and the final new song on the album, reminds me of something though what I can't say. It is good, but nothing special. It seems like a poor way to end the album. Maybe if it was tucked into the middle of the track listing somewhere, it wouldn't have mattered as much. This song just doesn't really do it for me somehow. Nothing wrong with it specifically, it's just not terribly inspired or original compared to their other works.<br />Overall, the cd is good...but not great. If more time had been spent in the studio at the mixing board and less trying to 'improve' already fantastic songs the thing would have been much better. It almost feels as if this was the demo piece, and their previous work the actual album. Sorry, Dragonforce; I love you, but this needs work. Worth the money for diehard fans only.br />Revelations suffers from mixing problems, though strangely the instrumentation is mixed perfectly, the lead vocals are far too low in the mix and the backing vocals are at the proper level...that is if the lead vocals had been mixed properly.

B00005JKN9|2.0|Technically and artistically brilliant, the film suffers from a warped perspective of humanity.  Only dark motivations are portrayed: hatred, vengeance, lust, desire for power.  Forgiveness, love, gentleness, nobility--all are missing.  (Save for one brief moment for the character elected mayor, and that ends in 20 seconds with a hatchet in his back.)  Even the missionaries appear to be deluded fools.  The major characters show no sign of personal growth (other than power, skill in murder, etc.).<br />If you want to watch a movie that seeks to convince you that people are animals--that even President Lincoln was the moral equal of a bloodthirsty gang leader, then this is the film for you.<br />If you want a film that shows the redemption of the violent, check out &quot;The Mission&quot; with Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons.
038533348X|4.0|Like a lot of Vonnegut's works, the religious/scientific concepts and the fictional society of Cat's Cradle are more interesting than the story itself. However, this does not make the book in any way laborious to get through. You will chuckle to yourself many times, and probably even laugh out loud a couple of times. Vonnegut's talent for writing comical satire is certainly up there with Joseph Heller and the other greats; and Cat's Cradle lives up to what you'd expect from a master in his field. This book is a quick read (I read it all during a cross-country plane trip) and will both amuse you and also plant some wacky, but nonetheless ingenius, ideas into your head. Another good one by Vonnegut, it's worth it if you're a fan of his style or are just interested in getting acquainted with his work.
0767903862|4.0|That's how you'll feel once you read this book. Despite the fact thatAustralia is one of the most dangerous continents on earth (if not the most dangerous), you will still feel the pull to visit and, possibly, become a resident.<br />The book recounts Bryson's assignment to essentially circumnavigate and criss-cross Australia, reporting on its people, its sights, and its culture. At each city or site he visits, he humorously recounts why its well known, who died there and why (for some odd reason, people keep setting out to cross the Outback and are never heard from or seen again), and what he found interesting about it. <br />Bryson points out the many dangers of Australia. Among them, of the ten deadliest snakes in the world, all ten happen to reside in Australia. For whatever reason, Bryson's writing style grabs you and pulls you. Almost like a thriller where you can't wait to get to the end, you'll fight falling asleep as you read late into the night while trying to find out what oddity he is going to encounter next in his travels.<br />Highly entertaining, informative, and recommended.
B00000294R|5.0|On my opinion the illest MC outta the last 4 that died this decade.I mean this done killed the rap game wit his punshline battle rhmin style that stuff was too complex for the mid 90's<BR>even Gay Z had Big L lessons and Cam'ron and look at them now <BR>there both sellouts.Sometimes i wish he never died this early <BR>because he didn't even blow up like Pac or B.i.g.<BR>I aint gonna spoil u by saying this album is good or bad just look at my topic.And get this YOU WILL ONLY HEAR 2 BIG L ALBUMS <BR>IN UR LIFE TIME SO COP THEM BOTH AND ENJOY THEM<br />My fav Lyrcist: Big L, NaS, Canibus,Rakim, KRS ONE, and Commen sense<br />R.I.P  BIG L<br />R.I.P
0385504209|3.0|At first I couldn't put this book down-the plot twists and clues were holding my interest pretty well. Then the situations got more preposterous, the chance encounters more convenient and the plot twists got predicable, which should be a cardinal sin for a book championing cryptology.
B00000JZI9|5.0|This is one of the first I'd title a modern western.  Everything you love about the old westerns without the cheesy earlier filmmaking.  Great cast, classic plot, very well-done!
B00003OSTK|5.0|There a few films that like a great song that can be heard over and over again and never get old.  For me it is this movie.  I love every single thing about this movie.  The acting, the characters, the writing, the cinematography, the music...Everything.  I wish I could live in that world with those people.  This is one of those movies that is important to me because I believe in the characters.  I want them all to be okay in the end.  I love them.  That is a very rare feeling for a film to leave with you.  &quot;Grand Hotel...People coming...Going...Nothing ever happens.&quot;  A masterpiece.
0385504209|1.0|This book is simply proof that the Truths of the One Religion, the Holy Catholic Church, with the One God it loves and promotes, will and must endure attacks from those that hate it throughout the ages to the End.  This fiction history is nothing more than a re-surfacing of the third century attack on Christ's Divinity, known then (and now) as the HERESY OF ARIANISM.  But, those whose faith is strong and foundations firm will not be troubled by this version of 21st Century anti-Christian nonsense.
B00009ATIX|3.0|This is one of those films that has it's share of problems but if you're in the right mindset you really might enjoy it.  It is a mood piece to be sure.  Not even so much a science fiction movie (it's really a thought provoking love story), and it has Clooney's best performance since Three Kings.  I loved the look, sound and acting in this film.  And more importantly I appreciated what I think Soderbergh was trying to do with the film.  Personally I think it's better than the original.  The original may have had more going on with the characters but it is really slow in spots whereas I think the pacing in this one is surprisingly strong.  This is not a movie for everyone and it is not a science fiction film.  If you can handle that aspect about it then I think you will like it.  It works better as a \\"weird\\" love story.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This is the very best of what Debbie &amp; the gang had to offer. Much better than the previous Best of Blondie (which had been out since 1981 &amp; nothing updated until now - ?!) ; this collection has everything you could possibly ask for and more! To hear &quot;X Offender &quot; &amp; &quot;The Hardest Part&quot; again after allthese years was great. They are better than ever now. This even has the awesome &quot;Maria&quot;! One of the best greatest hits to come out in some time!
B000089RVX|5.0|I enjoy listening to music of all types and most of the time while I may like a song, it rarely impresses me.  This album impressed me.  There is not a song that I don't like.  Evanescence is one of the best groups I've ever heard.  The combination of rock, vocals, and lyrics just amazes me.  I would recomment this CD to anyone.
6305513406|1.0|I'll wait for a DVD burner to come out and put more episodes on one disc. This is a total waste of space. Too bad they didn't make a box set of the Original Series like they did to The Next Generation.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This is it!!!  One of the best compilations of one band ever assembled.  Though many of the songs are shortened to their single versions, it does not detract from the incredible completeness of The Cranberries thus far.  \\"This Is The Day\\" is one of the most overlooked songs of all time.  It's worth picking up the album just for the new track \\"Stars\\" alone.  \\"New New York\\" fits right in, too, even if the theme has been a bit overdone these past couple of years.
B0000AOV85|1.0|If your looking for the actual concert of Dark Side<BR>of the Moon, then keep on looking. This is a \\"Making Of\\"<BR>type DVD with interviews and track overlays.

This is added in <BR>response to it didn't come out until 1973. Have you ever<BR>heard of \\"testing the waters\\" to see how it will be <br />received. The Moody Blues first album sucked bad (Bye Bye <BR>Blackbird)I am allowed to have an opinon, if you agree or not<BR>I don't care.

B0000A0DRY|5.0|Excellent re-mastering of this great album and really the first decent sounding CD of &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;.  Not only do the original tunes get the red carpet treatment here, the bonus tracks are excellent additions as well. A long blues jam is included with &quot;In the Morning&quot; and &quot;J.P.P. McStep B. Blues&quot; sounds better than ever, a previous version was included on the &quot;2400 Fulton Street&quot; collection. There's also a hidden track at the end of the CD that will pleasantly surprise.  <br />New liner notes are well written adding insight to the recordings. Additional photos from the sessions used for the original packaging are included. This re-master has been a long time coming and should move to the head of the class of the JA catalog!  A must for any Airplane fan or for those wondering just what the buzz was all about in 1967.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, Intervention, X-Static Process, &amp; Mother &amp; Father are all worth a listen.  I think Madonna is getting to the basics and throwing in a little synth, and I really like the end result.
B000002I6T|5.0|I found this album in a cut out bin. I took it home and didn't like it. I played it a few more times and really listened. It is now one of my favorites. The vocals just soar and the music is otherworldly. A wonderful collection of players and they are all so very compatible. This album is a true masterpiece. I have heard it said that listening to this album, you can hear David Crosby singlehandidly invent new age music. I would never accuse David of that but he does point it in that direction. In my opinion, a lot of rock music with spacey interludes is just what the doctor ordered. New Age Music is all spacy interludes. David can do that and still keep it interesting. I salute you Mr. Crosby.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I saw this on video YEARS ago, and suffered through it. For some reason, this time around, I enjoyed it a lot more. Maybe it's because it was with my wonderful girlfriend, but who knows? :)<br />it's actually very humorous, and a light-hearted look at relationships and how people read each other in the &quot;dance&quot; that is men and women trying to catch each others' eyes.
B000002UA0|5.0|Syd Barrett didn't write for everyone. I believe he wrote for himself. It's a shame that more people can't relate to his songs.<br />He posessed a childlike innocence that transcends childishness.<br />I think that anyone who can't see beyond that is too old for their age. One must reclaim that childlike quality and enjoy a pleasant romp through the world as seen through the eyes of a child.<br />Syd Barrett's eyes.
B00009P1O5|5.0|When I first heard it I didn't know what to make of it. Lot's of outakes and jamming??? No, it was something different.  It was grip-it and rip-it rock!  No doubt Kurt Coban et. all heard this sound too and took it to the next level. A true classic.
0316921173|3.0|Let me say off the bat that before I even checked Wallace's shaggy dog story out of the library I had read many of the Amazon reviews, so I knew there was no hope for an ending, that none of the Ennnet House people ever run into the Enfield Tennis Academy people, and that the real protagonist is dead before the novel starts. Despite those problems, the novel reminded me of Thomas Mann's \\"Der Zauberberg\\" (The Magic Mountain) in that they are both \\"descriptive\\" novels of damaged people and their surroundings that barely move at all until their respective finales. However, \\"Infinite Jest\\" layers so many characters and subplots that the already sluggish book sputters to a stop, even though some of them are truly hilarious in a dark way (Lenz the addict, the child tennis player who threatens to blow his head off with a pistol unless he wins, the history of ONAN) and worse yet, none of them truly add to the story (except to increase the book's bulk.) Not until the 400th page did I figure out that this novel really wants to be an Internet hypertext document, on top of being a satire of sports novels and cyberpunk stories (the latter being really hip when this novel was written.) Early on I did like the \\"Royal Tenenbaums\\"-like vibe the book gave off as it described the environs of ETA and the bizarre, dysfunctional relationship the Incandenza family had toward each other and the charges of the academy, a vibe that wore off when I realized that - unlike the Tenenbaums - the Incandenzas play for keeps. I don't know if novels about train wrecks have to be train wrecks, but this novel of depression and addiction both sent me into deep funks and forced me to read it until the last page.
0767836324|5.0|I love grownup versions of classic children's stories, such as \\"Ever After\\" (a grownup Cinderella) and this movie, \\"Hook\\", a very grown-up Peter Pan.  \\"Hook\\" takes a sobering look at the downside of being \\"grownup\\"- our propensity for taking ourselves and our responsibilities far too seriously, forgetting how to have fun along the way, and how it harms our relationships with our families, especially our children.  Robin Williams as the grown-up Peter shows what a truly good actor he is in this movie, and that his comic genius is but one of his talents.  Dustin Hoffman, always a show-stealer, does not disappoint.  His \\"Hook\\" is at once funny and a very scary guy, at one point even killing the leader of the Lost Boys - this is definitely not your kids' Peter Pan.  The supporting cast do an excellent job as well.  <br />The visuals are imaginative and engaging, such as the child-pleasing bright crayon-colored foods at their banquets, and serve to remind us of how life is different through the eyes of a child - Bright green ketchup?  Cool! - and what fun it was to \\"think outside the box\\" before it was educated and conformed out of us.  Hook himself remembers this, and uses this knowledge to steal Peter's disillusioned son away from him, an act of revenge that forces Peter to re-learn the art of having fun in order to rescue him from the despicable Hook.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br />On a more serious note, \\"Hook\\" is a cautionary tale to which many of us \\"grownups\\" need to pay close attention, living in a society as we do that places (or should I say \\"misplaces\\") so much emphysis on providing material goods - the newest, the biggest, the brightest, the best of everything - that we are in real danger of neglecting the one and only thing our kids really need - our time - time for guidance, time for teaching, time for discipline, and time for just plain fun.  Hook is very real, and he manifests himself in terrifying ways - drugs, alcohol, sex, and the human predators that offer these to our children on a daily basis.  I am very glad I bought this video, because I can take it out and watch it any time life gets too serious and I need a reminder of what is really important.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Identity is a highly stylized and entertaining horror/thriller.  It is unusual to find a movie these days that manages to maintain both the horrific (with its attendant shock and gore) and the thrilling (with its adrenaline rushes and carefully measured plot revelations) elements, with out resorting to cheap and gratuitous tricks. That Identity manages to balance these competing forces and resist the urge to go over the top, definitely works in its favour.<br />That said, one of the most memorable things in this movie is John Cusack getting wet.  John Cusack gets wet like no other actor - he revels in rain. He mopes in a downpour like no other actor can, with his everyman act drenched in melancholy and drowning in the turmoil that lies just beneath the surface, the seething puddle of emotions barely contained beneath the glassy surface. John Cusack is an ocean of untold depths and as such he should be forced to stand out in the rain in every movie he does.  Sinking into the mud, there is no other actor that can portray the pain felt inside all of us like a wet John Cusack.  The gaunt face, the sunken eyes made even more pitiful by the stream of water running off his limp and sodden hair.  The clothes sticking uncomfortably to his emaciated body as thought he were the last rat to jump ship from the Titanic.  John Cusack gets wet very well, and given that this movie is set in a thunderous downpour in the Nevada desert, there are ample opportunities for John Cusack to leave the safe confines of his warm, dry motel room and get soaked to the bone.  I think this happens on at least 10 occasions, but I may have lost count at some point.  Somenody needs to by this kid an umbrella - if he dies of pneumonia, it'll be some lousy director to blame for all the untold hours hanging around movie sets damp and chilly.  Not since the classic &quot;High Fidelity&quot; has a movie given John Cusack as much opportunity to be washed out on screen and he obviously loves the opportunity to return to his aquatic home.<br />That said, Identity grabs you and draws you in.  This is not something you can keep on in the background while you do the dishes - unusually for many modern movies, it requires thought, attention and concentration, and in the end one is rewarded for noticing the small details and questioning things all along.  Some parts are a little predictable (the banana who leaves the bunch gets skinned...), and some go too much for the shock value (Baseball bat? NP!), although there is a fair amount of black humour to be found here (Mom and Pop both getting crunched in horrifically gratuitous car accidents while their already disturbed son looks on?).  And of course, without revealing too much of the plot, there's the courtroom drama playing out in Carson City at the same time.<br />Identity relies on three major twists.  The first of these is huge and brilliant - it comes totally out of leftfield at a time when the plot is on the verge of falling apart, and turns the movie from going bad to being bizarre (Do we need to introduce a plot twist with &quot;Isn't this like that movie where...?&quot;?).  The second twist is good, but you should've seen it coming for about 30 minutes.  The final twist is kind of silly, and for me brings the movie down from 5 stars to 4.<br />Overall I highly recommend this film - the characters are good, well developed and sympathetic, the plot is intelligent and gripping, and the cinematography and setting create a great, creepy mood (speaking as someone who has spent a lot of time in shady motels in Nevada, including the &quot;Shady Motel&quot;, Caliente Nevada...).  The ending leaves a little to be desired, but at least it's not usual Hollywood fodder, and for that we can be thankful.

0471603864|5.0|David Griffiths' texts are indispensable for any beginner, and are used to &quot;translate&quot; more advanced texts.  I used his &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot; to fill in the gaps at the advanced graduate level, and his &quot;Electrodynamics&quot; was essential to understanding Jackson. I'm sorry that I waited so long to purchase his &quot;Elementary Particles&quot;.<br />This book contains all the background that professors expect you to have already been exposed to: particle classification schemes, the November Revolution, relativistic kinematics, and fundamental force overviews.  Griffiths then goes on to discuss Feynman rules, QED, QCD, electroweak and gauge theories.  Griffiths also works out some essential problems, like muon decay, that you will want to see done, but I think it is done better by Lahiri and Pal (that, however, is a field theory book, which might be more advanced than is necessary to some people in particle physics).<br />This is a great text for anyone starting out in particle physics and for anyone who needs to review the fundamentals.  My only bone with Griffiths is that sometimes more of the work is left to the reader than is appropriate (those problems worked out in gory detail are a godsend when you genuinely aren't getting the point).
B00000F6FN|3.0|I just rented this the other night due to the fact that many claim Suspiria to Be Dario Argento's masterpiece.  My only previous experience with Argento is Demons, which I saw over ten years ago and intend to view again.  Made in 1977, Suspiria is well ahead of its time in terms of atmospheric suspense.  It's almost Hitcockian at times.  It starts slowly but draws you in by the effective finale.  What surprised me the most was a fairly coherent plot(Argento has a reputation for gore and style).  It's not the scariest or goriest, but, if you love horror movies, you owe it to yourself to experience this film.
B000089RVX|1.0|This is something truely to be ashamed of, music is no longer alive master of puppets plays on in my cd player.....<br />Pro's:Its recycable<br />Con's:I listened to it
B000069HK2|4.0|I absoultly love this CD, Its one of those CD's were you can listen from #1 to #12, the blend together their song soo well, and Berts Vocal Range is amazing, The Used are going to spend some time in the studio, and i will not hesitate to buy that CD. Buy their CD/DVD its just as good as this CD
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park almost set themselves up as the perfect example of the sophomore jinx.Much to the dismay of Likin Park's critics they didn't. Almost every review you're going to see here is gonna sit around and complain about how Hybrid Theory was better, but that's just an opinion. What Meteora brings to the table is more of everything you loved and hated about Hybrid Theory, but more there's more than enough here to make you buy and enjoy this CD.You'll hear alot more good rapping by Mike and great screaming by Chester.The guitaring is standard LP fair- not much new here.Youll hear more rapping too, which is what some people hated, and at time the CD feels kinda sluggish(especially towards the end).Great songs like Faint and Numb headline the CD, which is the part of Meteora LP fans are sure to love.Along with these songs though comes a few odd ball songs like Nobody's Listening and Breaking The Habit.These songs take time to get used to, but present a different side of LP and help round out the CD.Overall the collage of great and good songs create a blend that only LP could produce and only LP fans are likely to love.If you liked Hybrid Theory then you NEED to but this CD. Just because it isnt exactly like Hybrid Theory doesnt mean you need to cry about it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is AWESOME. and i have seen all of the lord of the rings movies including the extended edition. I have bought the two towers DVD on widescreen and that is awesome. I would Rate this movie 10 stars if i could!!

B0000AI44Q|4.0|Greendale is the new CD/DVD release from Neil Young and in this form attempts to momentarily freeze a work-in-progress that has evolved into a staged concert that is currently on tour. For having the courage to drive into this particular ditch at this stage of his life and career, rather than play it safe, I give Neil (it) a four star rating. Neil calls it a novel, and the DVD and accompanying  booklet provide the narrative structure on which the ten song cycle hangs. It is Thornton Wilder's &quot;Our Town&quot; meets Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Nebraska&quot;. Most of the songs are fairly long and because of the narrative dimensions of the lyrics are a bit sluggish at times. <BR>Greendale is also a Rorshach test for both Neil and us as his audience. Heaven knows which of our projections will come closest to being on target about what this all means. It is fun and quite a bit of work to absorb all this, and not since the Kinks released &quot;Preservation Act 2&quot; have we been taken on such a ride into the cosmic dimensions of the demise of the &quot;village green&quot; as seen through the eyes of a rock lyricist.<BR>There are heroes and villains a plenty, and the reminder that &quot;good and evil exist in all of us&quot;.<BR>Neil takes up the themes of environmental destruction, the role of the artist in the age of the internet, the human life span, the loss of privacy, and the role of good and evil in our lives while weaving in a few allusions to his own father/son relationship in the process. The clues are scattered about the booklet and DVD(which is an acoustic solo version of the music with Neil providing the story line between songs). He name drops Mr. Dylan and John Lennon and dreamily evokes &quot;the summer of love&quot; in the opening song.  Neil is at turns nostalgic and angry, as the story prompts us to reflect on where we are and where we have been as a culture since that summer of love. The music, which is mostly blues based, bogs down at times from the narrative elements of the tale which it has to bear. Positioned as Neil is, chronologically, between Grandpa Green and Sun Green we get to see life at both ends of the human/creative spectrum, but for me, not until he &quot;speaks&quot; through Sun Green's voice on the song of that name do we catch a glimpse into the emotional center of the artist responding to the current social crisis we find ourselves in.<BR>Neil offers no easy solutions, though he challenges us to become less passive and more active in resisting the evil that befalls us(via what comes dangerously close to sloganeering) in the CD's closer &quot;Be the Rain&quot;.<BR>If Greendale evokes in you a desire to check out another &quot;concept album&quot; I recommend the Kinks &quot;Preservation Acts 1 and 2&quot;, which covers some of the same ground, a bit more tunefully.
B00009W8N2|3.0|Opeth's first record kicks off with a bang, and by that I mean the first 2 minutes on the first track is without a doubt one of the (best)...metal riffs in history. As soon as that's over though, you get pushed into a 14 minute song that's about 3-4 minutes too long. That's ok though, this is Opeths debut, I mean, I could never write a song like this. Track 2 is good but also has one long slow interlude in the middle that seems to just take too long, the acoustics toward the end are gorgeous though. Anyways, the rest of the record has it's ups and downs and are spread apart about 50/50. half good, half not so good. You do get treated to some INCREDIBLE music here though, like track 3, Silouette, an instrumental 3 minute piano ballad that'll leave your jaw dropped by its incredible charisma, breathtakingly beautiful rhythems and imaginative creativity. It's almost like some genious piece of work Mozart or Beethoven would write. Anyways, on to track 4 which is a little boring so I always skip it. The rest of the tracks on the record do have thier moments, mostly during the acoustic interludes which are beautifully written but overall the songs aren't very fulfilling. It's a very instrumental record, whereas while vocals go on for a few minutes, you'll then get treated to about 4 or 5 minutes of instrumentals before the vocals come back again. It's a very black metal record apart from the acoustics. Another downfall I should mention is that after a while the vocals on the record do become somewhat irritating, there is almost no clean singing on this one and mostly loud screeching growls. I mean, growls are cool and Opeth is known to utilize both singing methods but on this record it seems to go overboard with the growls. They're not even really growls but more high pitched yells that after a while start to annoy. Opeth did seem to learn from this though and now tone it down and add an equal variety of clean vocals within the music. <BR>In conclusion I should say that die hard Opeth fans are the only ones who'll really \\"get\\" this album, whereas newcomers by my suggestion should NOT buy this as their first Opeth record but pick up the later, more memorable genious works like Blackwater Park, Still Life, or Damnation. All hail Opeth, the riegning KINGS of metal!
B00005NG9Z|5.0|I have been a devoted Chains fan for as long as I can remember.  I acutally did not even know they had put out a DVD of their videos until a friend bought me this for my birthday in July.  All the video's look and sound excellent, especially with a nice home theatre system, or a decent rack system.  The highlights include &quot;Would,&quot; &quot;What the hell have I,&quot; &quot;Heaven Beside You,&quot; and other footage in between.<br />I must caution though, the sad part about this DVD is that you can see the steady decline of Layne Staley, who passed away in Spring 2002.  From the beginning he looks mostly normal, but by the time you see the videos from the &quot;tripod&quot; period and the MTV Unplugged, it appears that Staley is fried completely, given his empty stare and unheatlthy look.  Buy this if you are a fan of Alice in Chains, or if you like decent metal music.
B000000H42|5.0|Enough cant be said about this work of Satanic art.  It kicks totally ass all the way through and King Diamond's vocals are at there best.  It even has my favorite Fate song \\" Come to the Sabbath\\".  Every track is excellent and the song \\" The Oath\\" has to be one of the most satanic songs I've heard.  Even the cover art is HELLa bitchin'.  You cant go wrong with this album. SATAN COMMANDS YOU TO BUY IT.
0316666343|1.0|I agree with one reviewer already posted on two points. Firstly, the emotional impact of Susie Salmon's rape and murder is a bit lessened by the ridiculous detail of her elbow being found. How likely is that? Maybe I'm just a stickler for detail, but an elbow is extremely difficult to detach from the body. Secondly, the manner of Susie's murderer's death is trite and silly. It undoes the author's hard work at creating suspense around his capture. I would add that the dialoges between the characters seem completely unrealistic, especially those between young people. As I recall, love affairs in middles school were less than touchy, sentimental affairs. They were confused, superficial, and awkeward and usually did spell the beginning of life long romance. I guess what I was missing in the portrayal of youth and basically in all the characters (save the serial killer, of course) was the dark side. Everyone is so nice to each other and says all the right things (albeit in short, clipped sentences) even at the ages of 13 and 14. Whatever dark emotions are felt by the characters are never expressed in dialogue but rather by completely radical acts like hunting people in corn fields with baseball bats and running away to California. I had the feeling the Salmon family was a bit autistic. Are we to believe that that is what the death of a loved one does to us? Even Susie herself is amazingly even tempered considering the rage one would expect her to have. As another reviewer also pointed out, she sqanders her time on earth to have sex instead of revealing the location (which the omniscient Susie has seen) of her murderer. Not only is that a bit difficult to believe but makes her morally culpable in his future killings. Also, what kind of heaven are we talking about where people don't have sex? I think I'll close by saying that I found the author's description of heaven a bit claustrophobic and creapy. Why or why would she have wanted a carbon copy of her school in heaven? Why is she seemingly alone most of the time except for one depressing little girl and a murder counselor? It was implied that she wasn't in heaven proper yet because she hadn't let go. Catholics call this purgatory. Oh well. I guess that doesn't have the same ring to it as heaven. Reading this book was like being in purgatory. That about sums it up.
B000062Y98|4.0|This was the first Blind Guardian cd I've ever purchased, I was originally interested in them after seeing the beautiful artwork on the \\"Nightfall on Middle Earth\\" CD. This record though was actually one I was able to sample at a local store. Upon first listen the top word that popped in my head was CHEESY. The music in this isn't like the typical metal out there that gets thrown in your face all over TV and radio. It's very epic, very operatic, very symphonic, and very progressive. It's almost like a modern day louder, faster Queen, or what metal would've sounded like had it been around during victorian Ireland. The only other power metal I've been exposed to are Symphony X and Dream Theater. Blind Guardian is still progressive but not in the typical power metal way Sym X or Drm Thtr are. The guitars aren't as thick and BG incorporates vocals from what seems to be all the band's members, and they can all sing REALLY  well I might add. <BR>So I was open enough to listen to it the whole way through, I thought it was pretty good at first, then I gave it a few more listens and I only liked it more and more. There is just sooo much on this record you pick up new things the more times you listen to it. All the songs aren't too long or too short, most falling in the 5-7 minute area, the guitar playing is superb, the melodies entrancing, the catchy vocals and choruses will have you singing along and getting these songs stuck in your head for a good while afterward. At first you may think this is pretty headache inducing, noisy, and too abstract just as I did. But the more chances you give it the more the songs make sense, the more they fall together and the more structure you begin to understand. The album also contains 2 of what I've decided to be in my top 5 favorite songs EVER-\\"Maiden and the Minstral Knight\\" and \\"Waiting for an Answer.\\" I agree slightly with a fellow review who said this is a flawed masterpiece. Yes, it is flawed, but very very slightly. I took off 1/2star only because, like I said, this album isn't perfect, there are about 2 songs on this record I can't listen too a lot because they sound both a bit dragged (although they do have their great moments). A lot of people will disagree with me on this but that's just me, though I can say I do appreciate these songs for their depth and talent, or else I would've delete 1 or more stars. 2 songs is still a significant amount to delete 1/2 star. <BR>...I would say one must be more familiar with different forms of metal and that they all aren't consistent riffs and grunts, screams, etc as seen all over the media. This is epic prog metal at some of its finest. Those who are mature enough to understand the genre I highly recommend this record to, given enough time, I guarantee it'll be spinning on your cd player for a long time to come.

0688163173|4.0|Dennis Lehane's psycho thriller Shutter Island is set in the 1950's around the Boston area.  U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, a tough hard boiled WWII veteran is ordered to Shutter Island along with his new partner Chuck Aule to investigate the disappearance of an inmate of the Ashecliffe Hospital which located on the island.  Ashecliffe is a mental facility for the criminally insane.<br />Daniels soon learns that the patient, Rachel Solando, a triple child murderess has inexplicably vanished without a trace.  The hospital staff lead by a brilliant but mysterious Dr. Cawley is less than helpful in aiding the marshals.  As a hurricane bears down on the island stranding Daniels and Aule, the marshals make some startling discoveries.  They suspect that Ashecliffe is secretly being used for both surgical and pharmacologic experimentation on the inmates.<br />Daniels, who was an intelligence agent in the war, finds and deciphers clues apparently left behind by Solando to unravel the mysteries of Shutter Island.<br />Lehane's novel progresses along fluidly until it makes an abrupt and somewhat clumsy twist into a &quot;I can't believe he ended it like this&quot; conclusion.
6305897786|4.0|Rewatching this movie recently I was struck by how much it improves upon subsequent viewings. The subtle nuances of Johnny Depp's performance reveal themselves only to confirm that he is definitely one of the greatest living actors working today.<br />It's easy to see why mainstream audiences stayed away from this movie. There is an uneasy mix of playful, black humour and serious dread throughout that constantly keeps the viewer off balance -- in a good way. Also, Depp plays a decidedly unlikable character -- right from the start, where he screws a hapless family out of rare, expensive books, establishes that he is an unscrupulous book dealer only in it for the money. However, Depp's own natural charisma maintains interest in his character and even makes him kinda sympathetic in a weird way as he gradually realizes that he is in way over his head.<br />The use of European locations is excellent and effectively establishes an atmospheric vibe that gets me every time. It doesn't hurt that the film is shot by DP extraordinare, Darius Khondji (Seven). Every frame of this movie is beautifully shot.<br />The DVD itself is pretty good. The extras are a bit on the slim side with a superficial (and extremely brief!) Making Of featurette but the real crowning touch is an audio commentary by the man himself, Roman Polanski. He starts off a little slow but once he gets going, offers quite a few interesting tidbits and views on filmmaking (and, of course, the movie itself) and is definitely worth a listen for Polanski fans.<br />This is an underrated film that is definitely worth a look if you like something a little different in your films. It doesn't hold your hand like most Hollywood fodder does and this a refreshing change.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This DVD bring to life a world only existing in the author's imagination.  I hated the books .. but loved the movie and DVDs.

B00001U0DP|5.0|When I rented it (because it was an Academy Award winning movie), I was not aware it was subtitled.  Before the first 15 minutes was over, I was so totally engrossed in this movie I did not realize I was reading the dialogue.<BR>A suggestion would be to watch this movie when you are free from distractions as it is important to the story to catch everything.<BR>You fall in love with Roberto Benigni, laugh at his antics and admire him for his selflessness. <BR>Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen.

0767817729|4.0|This is one of my favorite Kostner movies.  It is a grisly tale, but interesting and suspenseful.  It contains Kostner's hottest love scenes to date (I haven't seen Open Range yet). <BR>The weakness of this movie is the directing...very uneven. But it didn't spoil the movie for me.  It is great.  A friend of mine said when she saw it that it made her want to go out and buy a jeep. Those who have seen it will understand.

B00009APK1|4.0|I assume you have read the books or at a minimum seen the first video. J.R.R. Tolkien's second book of the LOTR series, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; would never fit in a three hour movie. Having said, that I love this DVD!<BR>  The sweeping vistas of New Zealand are magnificent. The cinematography is breathtaking. The special effects are solid and unobtrusive. In fact they are so seamless that you find yourself completely taken in. One of my favorites special effects is that of Legolas (the elf) moounting a galloping horse. The computer generated battle scenes are completely believable and realistic!<BR>  The score for this video is a bit below the quality of &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; but didn't detract from the overall presentation. The music seems further in the background, perhaps &quot;muted&quot;.<BR>  Detail, costumes and sets are great. I was specially delighted by the director's presentation of the &quot;magical&quot; characters. The characters in general ae superbly acted, the performances flawless. I really liked the touch of &quot;elvish&quot; in the love scenes between Aragorn and Arween, it adds an ephimeral quality.<BR>  The only reason I didn't give this DVD a five star rating is that it is not as engaging as it could be. I'm really hoping the extended version will live up to the extended version of the &quot;Fellowship&quot; and smooth out some of the story line gaps.<BR>A great DVD. You will wonder where the three hours went!
B000067CPX|5.0|\\"By The Way\\" is RHCP's best work since \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik\\". It is a diverse, experimental, fun, upbeat, downbeat album, with delicate, wonderful, thoughtful lyrics. Blows \\"Californication\\" out of the water. If you are a first time RHCP listener, buy \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik\\", then buy \\"By The Way\\", then \\"Californication\\", then the order doesn't metter after that. Those are the key albums in the RHCP collection. So buy \\"By The Way\\" if you are thinking of buying it.

0060007737|4.0|For anyone involved in branding this book gives very practical advice. A common complaint about business books is that they only see things from marketing functions and lacks overall strategic consideration. Overall very impressive and a must read for anyone involved in advertising or marketing! Another book I highly recommended is 60-Minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee. This book is really LOADED with SOILD, meaty real world branding insights and techniques that can are being kept as trade secrets. You will probably find this book a real eye opener. If you're looking for a more balanced marketing book, suggest going for David Aaker's books, some Kotler's books.

B000001ESP|5.0|This is definately Rush's most commericially successful album and it is definately lacking the prog-rock/sci-fi sound of the 70's but Rush is a band that is constantly evolving. And this album shows a band on the verge of stepping into new territories.<br />1. Tom Sawyer. Rush's biggest hit, you'll hear it everywhere, but the lyrics on Peart's part are nothing short of extraordinary. &quot;Though his mind is not for rent, don't put him down as arrogant...&quot; This song stresses Rush's most basic beliefs of Libertarianism. Neil Peart's drumming is amazing too,his solo in the middle is set in something like 13/8 time beat or something crazy like that, i'm a guitarist not a drummer. <br />2. Red Barchetta. Such a great song, and the lyrics of it warn of the dangers of liberals basically.<br />3. YYZ. Great song but it's no &quot;Villa Stangiato&quot;.<br />4. Limelight. One of the most popular riffs of all time. This song is a look at life on the road I guess, but Neil Peart's got some other crazy stuff I'm sure.<br />5. The Camera Eye. Great lyrics, not one of my favorite musically though.<br />6. Witch Hunt (part III of 'Fear'). Very dark song<br />7. Vital Signs. Synths are very evident in this song making it a great run in to their 80's styled albums.<br />All in All, i'd say that this is a good album to start off your Rush collection with, but no collection could be complete without &quot;Hemispheres&quot;
0316666343|1.0|I read this piece, and when I say piece, I'm politely leaving off two words, a couple months ago when I picked it up in an air port. I had a long flight. I'm glad it was just a book and not the in-flight movie, or else people would have been walking out. As it was, I had the luxury of being able to stare out the window for hours at a time rather than read through this book so fast.<br />I had heard so many good things about this book! After readng it for myself, I had to wonder: why on earth would anyone like it? Well, a few weeks ago, I was in a book store and saw another book by the same author. It was a memoir about dealing with a brutal rape. The similarity in subject matter made the final piece of the mystery fall into place. NOW I knew why so many people liked the book.<br />Pity.<br />People have attached some kind of expression of sympathy to the book, showing their support for the victim of a random act of violence by pretending that this novel is a wonderful work of fiction. Every single person I've spoken to who has liked this book has mentioned the author's victimhood. This isn't Alice Sebold's book. It's that rape victim's book.<br />Come on, people. Wake up and smell the roses. Sure, it's a shame that the writer was a victim, but her being a victim doesn't make her any better at writing.
B000001ESF|4.0|The major flaw with this album is that Geddy Lee hadn't perfected his voice yet and it is still sort of screachy. But other than that the only problem is that, parts of side two of the album are too long and drawn out. I think the album could have also gone without &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; but definately one of Rush's greatest is the closing track &quot;Something For Nothing&quot;<br />This is a great album, it's the one that got me into Rush, but there are definately better albums like &quot;Hemispheres&quot; or &quot;Signals&quot;
0739307312|5.0|With all the hype around this book, I had to find out for myself.  I didn't really have time to sit down and read it, so I got the audio cassettes.  The reader (Colin Stinton) is excellent at reading the story.  He has many different voices that he changes to for different charachters.  I find this quite astonishing acutally, because sometimes, I can't tell that it is the same person speaking all these voices.<br />The story line is magnificent.  It is a fast paced novel from start to finish.  The only disappoinment I have is when it ended...now I have to find another book as entertaining as this one!<br />You will not be disappointed with the audio version of this book.  The reader keeps you going and connected to the charachters and Dan Brown's story is compelling!
B000001ESN|5.0|A classic Rush album, it is the next part of the evolution of Rush. This album sounds alot like 1981's \\"Moving Pictures\\" but it's alot better written. This record is not a concept album like their past ones, this is more song based, but that's not a bad thing, because the songs are superb. 4-5 Minute songs. Still a great record.<br />1.\\"The spirit of radio\\" - This was a really big hit in it's time. A Rush classic about the power of the modern music industry. The song is just so catchy and the lyrics are well written like every other Rush song. 4/5<br />2.\\"Freewill\\" - A very dark song but the power of it's lyrics still hold validity. I hear it on the radio atleast 3 or 4 times a week. It is about people's will that others try to manipulate. And it is easily my favorite song by the band. Great riff!!! 5/5<br />3.\\"Jacobs ladder\\" - Resembles one of their early epic tracks, it's around 8 minutes and is the second longest song on the album. There is just some crazy instrumental work going on by all three members at the same time. As a musician it is still even hard to understand how these guys do this. It's a slower dark song about the power of nature. 5/5<br />4.\\"Entre nous\\" - Cacthy, it's nice. Nothing too special, not many people I know really like it but still it's good. I feel it actually could have been a single. 5/5<br />5.\\"Different strings\\" - A Rush ballad with ever so dark lyrics pertaining to love. 5/5<br />6.\\"Natural science\\" - This is a really long song and I felt it was a nice way to end the album. This is another track like \\"Entre Nous\\" that isn't well accepted by Rush fans, but I think it's perfect. 5/5<br />All in all this album is perfect for someone who is just getting into Rush, because it exposes all elements of their evolution at one time. It's a transition from the 70's to the 80's and it's a really nice touch.
B0000A98ZP|3.0|I like the new re release of The Breakfast Club. It's great that it is in dolby digital sound and dts. But what the hell happened to some bonus features. I was expecting one or two deleted scenes;maybe an audio commentary as well. I know there are different scenes in existence, since i've seen them on some of the edited for t.v. versions. Those are the only things I didn't like about the DVD

Easily my favorite Rush song, it's got everything, great libertarian lyrics, great riff, and just an overall great song.<BR>3. Jacob's Ladder. This could have been made into one of their long epics but it's relatively short.<br />6. Natural Science. One of my favorite Rush songs, atleast lyrically one of my favorite.
0385504209|2.0|After all the hyperbole surrounding The Da Vinci Code, I was expecting to read a well written, thoughtfully chacterized and enlightening book. In its favor it must be said that this novel is definitely a page-turner. The action is fast paced and there is lots of it. However, that is part of the problem. The action is so fast, and much of it so far fetched, that the story strays dangerously into the realm of the brainless &quot;beach book&quot; written with a movie version as its ultimate goal. The characters are very thinly drawn and virtually caricatures of themselves - the beautiful French woman, the dry and dreamy academic, the physically repulsive hit man, the overly English Englishman, the predictable red herring in the form of the tough French police officer - it all strains credulity. The language which Dan Brown puts in his characters' mouths does not ring true and detracts from what could have been a far more appealing book. There are some truly interesting ecclesiastical triviata, observations and theories in the story, but they are dished up with a pretentiousness which renders them indigestible. Dan Brown gives in to the temptation to lecture his readers far too often. The twists and turns in the plot are too predictable and tidy to be surprising and they are dressed up in somewhat patronising terms. I don't plan on giving any of the secrets away, but the sleight of hand with which the author neatly ties up his loose ends strays dangerously near to being laughable. Evidently a great deal of research went into the writing of the book and the underlying premise is both clever and fascinating, it is therefore a pity that an editor did not work with Mr. Brown to smooth out the presentation and make this the genuinely clever novel which it could have been.<br />If you are looking for an easy summer read then this fits the bill, but don't be taken in by the talk of true mysteries, religious controversy and academic puzzles. This is a reasonably entertaining thriller, nothing more.ller, nothing more.
6305232660|1.0|DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW if you can forgive a science fiction film for a lot of bad science. But if you are an astronomy buff like me, take this review as fair warning.<br />I had SUCH high hopes for this movie. \\"At last!\\" I thought, \\"They're finally making a scientifically-accurate film about a cometary impact!\\" And check out that poster! Looks like The End Of The World, for sure! COOL!<br />So I shelled out my money and sat down in the dark theater to watch \\"Deep Impact,\\" and within ten minutes I had started to squirm. \\"You can't predict a comet's path that far in advance!\\" I wanted to scream at the screen. Then the astronomer who discovers Earth is doomed gets KILLED in a car crash, and evidence of his discovery goes flying out the window on a diskette! I guess this was for dramatic effect.<br />But wait! The diskette must have been found, because now there's a secret project to move some select people deep underground, presumably to rebuild civilization after the comet hits. Except that we never get to see any of these immense underground warrens. Probably would've taken the picture over budget.<br />Then the smaller half of the comet hits the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in some interesting CGI. But if the larger half of the comet strikes, then civilization is most certainly doomed. What kind of a world will the underground survivors emerge to find? THAT would have made for a visionary science fiction film. But NO, we won't be treated to that, because at the very end the apocalyptic object is blown up by some heroic astronauts, and all the millions of fragments burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere. HARMLESSLY??? Hmmm, in real life the kinetic energy of the comet would still remain, and standing under the open sky would've have been like being in an oven set to BROIL. But that wouldn't have been a very crowd-pleasing ending, now would it?<br />Remember when the beautiful Comet Hale-Bopp lit our evening skies? Remember when Comet Shoemaker-Levy took bites out of Jupiter? If either of those objects had struck Earth, we'd be lucky to have bacteria left. This is one of the reasons we MUST begin branching out from beyond our own planet. Our survival as a species depends on this. And perhaps one day a truly visionary film director will create a movie that deals with this scenario more realistically, but \\"Deep Impact\\" is not that movie. For all its introspection about how humankind might deal with its impending doom, \\"Deep Impact\\" is bad astronomy and bad science.ter?

B0000AUHOH|4.0|I believe that Star Trek V has its moments with the crew and has a potentially strong story if you watch and think about it for a few times.  Paramount should have given William Shatner the chance to improve the special effects and the ending like Robert Wise did to Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  In the end, it is still an above average special edition compared to the others like II-IV, which could have had more special features like the deleted scenes.  Star Trek V is definitely a good collector's item if you plan to purchase all 10 of the special editions.
B00005JLTN|5.0|The Matrix series are the best sci-fi series since the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" (ahead of its time).  The scenes are so dynamic they are almost unbelievable.  You can watch Matrix Reloaded over and over and be thrilled as much as when you watched it the first time.  Not many movies can give you that kind of pleasure.  An unequaled sci-fi thriller!

B00000K2VZ|5.0|I've never understood the intensity of the PEARL vs. CHEAP THRILLS debate among Joplin fans.  Yes, the Big Brother record captured Janis at her raw vital best.  Her final album, with the more polished Full Tilt Boogie, was a somewhat different breed of animal, tighter, more \\"professional,\\"  and ultimately, more commercial, providing Joplin her posthumous (and sole) number one hit in Kristofferon's \\"Me and Bobby McGee.\\"  I loved all of Janis' records--including the much maligned Mainstream debut and only somewhat less maligned Kozmic Blues--and never felt compelled to take a stance.  The body of work isn't that extensive: it's better to treasure each one for what it has to offer.<br />And they all offer at least a few real pearls.  The variety of styles that Janis' embraced during her brief recording career was impressive.  Her former road manager, John Cooke, notes in the liner notes to this newest version of PEARL that Janis' musical restlessness was reflective of her \\"questing nature.\\"  That's certainly true--three different bands in as many years suggests as much--and it's also reflective of the times as well.  No one expected the Beatles to do SGT. PEPPER REDUX or the Stones to linger at the (BEGGAR'S) BANQUET for very long.<br />Moreover, by 1970, when PEARL was recorded, there was more of an emphasis on tighter musicianship and less experimentalism.  You could argue that had Janis, in fact, remained with Big Brother, they would have both mellowed out and tightened up themselves (as evidenced on their post-Janis records in the 70s).  Maybe so, but there can be little doubt that FTB was a good band and a perfect accompaniment for Janis and that the move toward a more keyboard based sound complemented her vocals in a way that was different (if not necessarily better) that Big Brother's twin guitar freak out.<br />There's no epic \\"Ball & Chain\\" style number here, although \\"Get It While You Can\\" is an offering in something of the same spirit, if not the same magnitude. Much of the material here is straightforward rock'n'roll (\\"Move Over,\\" \\"Half Moon\\") appropriate for any bar or garage band to cover.<br />But along with all that full tilt boogying,  there's still plenty of emotional heft. The feeling that she can pack into a single phrase, or WORD, can be revelatory.  When she sings, \\"a woman left lonely is just a VICTI-I-IM of her man,\\" well, you just better believe the lady.  <br />\\"Bobby McGee\\" was, of course, proof of what fans already knew, i.e. that Janis was not just about screaming her lungs out.  I was glad in the winter of '71 to finally have a Joplin track I could play for my mom,  proof not only that Joplin could sing, but that she could be subtle to boot.  In fact, a careful listening to PEARL will proove that as Cooke observes in his notes, she was beginning \\"to learn...something she never expected to learn: how to sing in a new way...(one) that would allow her to sing for years to come.\\"  <br />And that touches on another debate among fans, the one about how long she would have had before her voice gave out totally.  It's not just \\"Bobby McGee\\" that suggests that she was learning to rely on more on phrasing and shading than on belting.  Every track on the album suggests a more mature singer was emerging, with no loss of spontaneity or vitality though.  She would have continued to make great blues rock records for years to come, had she lived.  Of that I am convinced.<br />The bonus tracks are all previously unreleased \\"live\\" tracks with Full Tilt Boogie.  Similar live arrangements of three of these songs have been released in the past, however, so the listener is justified in getting that deja-vu all over again feeling. Fans like me are glad to have them anyway.  There are always little differences in phrasing or in her vamps that are worth the price of admission.<br />For Joplin newbies, though, I'd suggest playing PEARL through a few times straight, and stopping it BEFORE the bonus live tracks.  Ending the record with \\"Get It While You Can\\" was ending the record on just the right note.  It's a mini-anthem for Joplin--as much \\"on message\\" as \\"Bobby McGee\\" certainly. And both songs took on new meaning in light of her death.  <br />The debate about which Joplin record was the \\"best\\" will likely rage on among devotees.  Me, I'm not gonna worry about it.  To me they're all classics.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The story of a town and its inhabitants, told with the charm, wit, and musical genius of neil young.  Probably the best neil young album to come out since the 60's as far as I can tell.  I picked this up the day it came out and have played the cd or dvd every day since.  I personally prefer the dvd to the cd as the live acoustic songs with the stories inbetween are beautiful and have a bit more depth to them lyrically.  One cannot deny that the music of crazy horse on the cd adds its own twist to the stories.  This is is my favorite neil young cd to date.  Great concept, great story, great music, buy it now while it still has the dvd.
1563894696|5.0|Every writer of Batman for the past fifteen years or so has been living in the shadow of Frank Miller. With both Batman: Year One and The Dark Knight Returns, Miller nailed down a reputation as one of the best creators to ever tackle the mythos surrounding the caped crusader, at the same time setting a standard for quality stories that, to be honest, few have even come close to reaching since. <br />But much as in recent months Brian Michael Bendis has finally been able to live up to Miller's reputation over in Daredevil, one writer in recent years has been able to match the pure excellence of Miller's work with Batman, a writer named Jeph Loeb. His seminal miniseries with artist Tim Sale, Batman: The Long Halloween, stands out as the best story involving the character in the past fifteen years and one of the greatest Batman tales told of all time. <br />A mystery told in 13 parts, The Long Halloween spans over three hundred pages and not a one of them is wasted. Taking place over the course of one year in the life of Batman, the story follows shortly after the events of Batman: Year One, when Batman first arrived on the scene in Gotham City. It even involves a few of the minor characters seen in Miller's work, as it details Batman's hunt for a serial killer who strikes each month on a major holiday at major crime figures in Gotham. As each month the bodies pile up, Batman becomes more and more driven to find the killer's true identity and end the bloodshed. Loeb uses the whodunit aspect of this story to keep readers guessing until the very last page, and even beyond the book's end. <br />But far more than being a tale of the mob in Gotham or a simple murder mystery, The Long Halloween is an in-depth character study of those people that populate the world in which Batman operates, not the least of which is Bruce Wayne himself. Through his narration we are given such incredibly deep insight into his motivations that, when he acts, we see the logic behind each actionfrom his point of view. We see him gradually driven to the point of obsession in finding Holiday, and we realize that he could not have behaved in any other way. <br />Those characters usually relegated to minor status are also allowed to come out in full force. Selina Kyle, Harvey Dent, Jim Gordon-all have been a part of Batman's life for years, but here we get to see how these relationships started, what molded them into the shape they are today. Even Johnny Viti, one of those minor mafiosos Miller threw into Year One, Loeb gives a chance to shine in this tale, although his time on the page is almost as brief. The characters draw readers in, truly engaging them in the narrative much more so than a mere four-color fistfight or a soap opera in tights can. <br />The art too is absolutely exquisite. Tim Sale is an artist who can really make characters breathe, and his action sequences truly come to life. Too often comic artists make many of their characters look the same, but Sale really makes his characters stand out from one another. Harvey Dent is not just Bruce Wayne with lighter hair; he has a look all his own, created not only through facial expressions but posture as well. When Alberto Falcone and his father The Roman stand side by side, we can see a family resemblance, but they are not carbon copies of each other. Sale is sometimes criticized for over-using the splash page and the two-page spread, but here the images deserved the treatment they got and every picture is worth thousands upon thousands of words. <br />Thematically the book transcends the conventions of either the superhero or crime genres and ends up meaning so much more than a typical tale of good versus evil. By the end of this story, everyone has suffered from being a part of it; in the end, no one wins. This concept is a constant in Batman's life, that his crusade is not actually spawned by the death of his parents, but by the consistent losses he has felt in his life ever since that fatefulday. For Batman, and for everyone else that crosses his path in this story, the losses continue here as well. <br />Along with Year One and The Dark Knight Returns, The Long Halloween is one of the quintessential Batman stories, and no one can lay claim to the label of a true Bat-fan without having partaken of the sheer brilliance crafted here by Loeb and Sale.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This CD is pop music masterpiece.  I've been a fan since the early 80s and Duran have put out a lot of music since then.  However, RIO still reigns as my all-time favorite.

0930289528|5.0|If you ask most people who the greatest living writer in comics is, they'll reply without hesitation Alan Moore for his role in taking comics beyond their ordinary roots and single-handedly expanding the potential of an entire medium. If you then ask what work of Moore's best exemplifies this contribution, most will again not waver before responding that Watchmen is not only Moore's greatest work but quite possibly the best comic book ever produced. <br />And in the case of Moore's gift to comics, these people would be one hundred percent correct. It is not possible to laud this man and his genius enough. However, in naming his best work, they have fallen short. Yes Watchmen is brilliant, and yes it is quite possibly the best exploration of the superhero that has been or can ever be written. But Moore's best work? Not by a long shot. <br />And no, his best work is not either of his tenures on Miracleman or Swamp Thing, as groundbreaking and innovative as those runs were. Nor can it be found in painstakingly researched books like From Hell and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which are crafted with such time and care that they require extensive notes to fully grasp all the details dropped in by this master craftsman and his collaborators. <br />Rather, Moore's best work comes in the form of a novel about the fascist government in the England of the future and the man who rebels against the system, a man named only V. The book is V for Vendetta, reprinted today by DC from their ten-part series of 1988, which in turn was made up of reprints of work originally seen in England in the early 1980s in the magazine Warrior as well as new material to close the story out. It is not only my favorite graphic novel but quite possibly also the best work written to date in this medium. <br />Now admittedly, I am quite biased in claiming it is the best comic ever written, because my love for it is so deep. V for Vendetta marked a first for my collection, as it was the first book Iowned as both individual issues and in trade paperback form. I have given away my trade paperback before, only to buy a new copy when I missed it so much. I hope to someday own the original Warrior issues and I would be more than happy, should DC ever decide to release a hardcover version, I would pay top dollar for that as well. <br />It is also the only comic book I read repeatedly. I have probably read V for Vendetta at least ten times if not more, and I know that I shall read it again. Very few books I read in any form are deemed worthy of repeat perusals. Breakfast of Champions is one, A Prayer for Owen Meany another, Catch-22 yet another-these are all books that I come back to many times to read again and again, gaining new perspectives on both the text and myself each time we cross paths. And V for Vendetta is among them, a book I cannot go more than a year without opening anew. <br />Shall I give you tons of reasons why I think it's so brilliant? Shall I tell you of the deep philosophical mind of the main character V, a man who takes a meaningful stand against the system for the betterment of mankind? Shall I inform you of the beautiful portrayal of Evey, a young girl who has lost all to the system and whom V takes under his wing? Shall I tell you of David Lloyd's exquisite artwork which makes the cityscapes of London seem familiar and which, through the use of his muted colors, creates an almost tangible atmosphere of the dim, dull existence of life under this fascist regime? <br />No. Instead I shall choose not to spoil your reading experience and leave you to discover these things for yourself. Just one warning, though: do your damnedest not to cry when you read Valerie's letter, composed on toilet paper. It gets me every time.
B000002UAU|2.0|It was disappointing to discover that this CD falls short of all the praise it seems to get in these reviews, but with songs like When I'm 64, Within You Without You, Fixing A Hole, and Benefit of Mr. Kite, I just have to be honest.  <br />Some of the other songs are good (A Day in the Life) but one song doesn't save an album.  Some Beatle albums are better, like Help, but this is only about a 2-star CD.
B000069HK2|5.0|What an incredible cd.  I'm so glad I decided to buy it.  The songs are so catchy and the lyrics are amazing.  Awesome cd.  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to great songs from a great band.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This is a great CD!! I liked it much better than De Stijl, The White Stripes, and White Blood Cells combined! I think they keep just getting better and better. The songs on here are much longer than white blood cells, and don't have that icky blues type that some of the white blood cells stuff has, as in I Can Learn. My favorite song by far on the album is The Hardest Button to Button. This song has nice drums, and a good beat,  and some of the good qualities of Union Forever on the previous album. Though you cant actually dance to any of the songs, they are great to listen to, and you can actually understand the words! I would not recommend this to people who dont appreciate songs that are not about pimps or fans of Baby Got Back. This is a true 'artsy' cd that jack expresses his emotions. I also love the intro for \\"Little Acorns\\" by Mort Crim. The only song I do not thoroughly enjoy is \\"Its true that we love one another\\". While it does have the countryish tune of Hotel Yorba, it just is not my style. This Cd however is a great tribute to indie/rock/punk.
B0000AEKCG|5.0|A lot of nonsense is talked about psychedelic music (and yes, I know it's all subjective) but this is quite simply the most effective rock album ever made for enjoying and promoting altered states of consciousness.<BR>Until the advent of the synthesizer as an affordable item, it was impossible for rock music to be as colourful (in a tonal sense) as it needed to be to be as psychedelic as it could be. With 'Warrior on the Edge of Time', Hawkwind hit their high water mark: similar to Roxy Music in the breadth and richness of their musical pallette (electric and acoustic guitars, bass, drums, percussion, flute, saxes, electric violin, piano, synthesizers and mellotron, plus 4 different vocalists), Hawkwind at this time were the consummate painters in rock - Dalinian mindscapes filled with the awe, terror and sheer bliss of Coleridge's 'Kubla Kahn'.<BR>The musicians are at the height of their stylistic powers - Brock has never sounded so mournful and folky as on 'The Demented Man' (make's Floyd's 'Echoes' seem childish by comparison), nor more messianic on 'Assault & Battery'. Turner's sax on 'The Golden Void' transports the listener into an opium dream in an Egyptian tomb while has weird vocals on 'Dying Seas' remind us of how avant-garde Hawkwind were. Lemmy's bass paints pyramids in the minds eye at the opening of 'Assault' and his lyrics on the original version of 'Motorhead' ( a bonus track on some versions of this CD) are utterly original: 'we're moving just like a parallelogram' to 'all good clean fun - have another stick of gum', pure British Amphetamine Rock ! Drummers King and Powell are at their hottest, especially on the throbbing 'Opa-Loka' which would not need a remix to become an acid house hit today and Michael Moorcock's spoken word pieces like 'The Wizard Blew His Horn' will blow the mind of any Tolkien fan. Finest of all perhaps are the contributions of Simon House, whose sublime electric violin's piercing entry at the start of 'Golden Void' is one ofthe most apocalyptic moments in rock history. House's 'Spiral Galaxy' is utterly cosmic - they don't make synthesizers that bright anymore ! There are no duff tracks here either - all have their unique and frightening pleasures: more variety in 45 minutes than most bands manage in a lifetime.<BR>Why this album escapes all the prog rock reference books is beyond me - actually, it doesn't: Hawkwind were always a little but rough and grungy for prog purists, which is why they survived Punk with critical status unchanged. Their roughness is here spattered with diamonds, a perfect balance between thudding rock noise and symphonic beauty with none of the pompousness of ELP or Yes. <BR>Oh and yes, the production is magnificent. If you like classic colourful seventies rock like later Bowie, early Roxy, then this album is a must. Its mind may be on space, fantasy and the unreal, but its heart is as romantic and existential as any of the serious Glam or Punk artists of the finest decade in rock. A prismatic beacon in the murky mists of rock and roll. Essential.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This is a great CD!! I liked it much better than De Stijl, The White Stripes, and White Blood Cells combined! I think they keep just getting better and better. The songs on here are much longer than white blood cells, and don't have that icky blues type that some of the white blood cells stuff has, as in I Can Learn. My favorite song by far on the album is The Hardest Button to Button. This song has nice drums, and a good beat,  and some of the good qualities of Union Forever on the previous album. Though you cant actually dance to any of the songs, they are great to listen to, and you can actually understand the words! I would not recommend this to people who dont appreciate songs that are not about pimps or fans of Baby Got Back. This is a true 'artsy' cd that jack expresses his emotions. I also love the intro for \\"Little Acorns\\" by Mort Crim. The only song I do not thoroughly enjoy is \\"Its true that we love one another\\". While it does have the countryish tune of Hotel Yorba, it just is not my style. This Cd however is a great tribute to indie/rock/punk.
B00007LTIB|4.0|Along with &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans,&quot; the 1974 album &quot;Relayer&quot; constitutes the third stage in the career of Yes. The first was the early experimental stuff nobody remembers and the second stage was their glory years with &quot;The Yes Album,&quot; &quot;Fragile,&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge.&quot; The group was clearly moving in the direction of &quot;suites&quot; (i.e., single &quot;songs&quot; that took up an entire side of a record) and in this third stage they indulged in this approach to the extreme. &quot;Relayer&quot; had only three songs: &quot;Gates of Delirum&quot; on side 1, and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; and &quot;To Be Over&quot; on side 2. These suites alternate between instrumental sections where guitarist Steve Howe, bass player Chris Squire, keyboardist Patrick Moraz, and drummer Alan White are given there opportunities to solo, and vocal and choral sections when singer Jon Anderson lapses into spirutal lyrics.<br />On the one hand this is what they had been doing before, but now the sense of structure that made the early suites so great is pretty much missing. &quot;Relayer&quot; comes across more like a studio jam session, which will strike some Yes fans as being pretentious and others as a worthwhile musical exercise. For others as long as Roger Dean does the cover painting that is justification enough for picking up this album (at least you could use record covers as art; hard to do that with CDs). It all depends on what you think Yes's music was all about in the end.  This remastered recording offers three additional track with single edits of both &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; and &quot;Soon,&quot; and a studio run-through of &quot;The Gates of Delirum.&quot;  For die-hard Yes fans there might be some insights in paying attention to the details, but there is nothing really special here.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I first read the Lord of the Rings nearly forty years ago and was swept away by the moving story and the beautiful writing.  I remain convinced that no motion picture can do full justice to the trilogy, but both Peter Jackson's Fellowship and Two Towers provide a beautiful and entertaining interpretation.  The second volume was obviously a more difficult work to bring to the screen owing to its shifting plotlines, but Jackson and the other two screenwriters have produced a coherent and powerful story, as should be even more evident in the forthcoming extended DVD.  One can quibble about a number of things here--the scrub-brush look of Rohan, the funky look of the wargs, Faramir taking Frodo to Osgilliath--but the best thing is to just calm down and let Jackson take you on one hell of a fine ride.  This is a splendid interpretation given the tremendous challenges posed by Tolkien's masterpiece.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I wasn't even born when this film came out.  I believe FAIL-SAFE is one of the most important films of it's time.  And, all too real for it's day.  With the Cuban Missile Crisis and nuclear tension at an all-time high, we needed this film to remind us that we cannot depend on machines to protect us.  They may, in fact, be the enemy.  Because the ending was so dark and unimaginable for it's time, i'm sure it made people think twice about engaging in nuclear war, contrary to one reviewer's opinion.  Eventually, with a better understanding of each other, along with an instinctual desire to survive, a peaceful resolution between the United States and the Soviet Union was made.  I give films like this the due credit for helping us to see the alternative to tolerance.<br />Now, I only wish George II could see the light...before he does us all in.
0060537639|2.0|The most fascinating thing about this book is its demonstration of how logical fallacies and self deception can allow someone to reach any conclusion they wish.  The author consistently makes huge leaps of faith based on logical fallacy, conformation bias, selective thinking, and plain old lazy thinking.  Each layer of wild conjecture becomes the foundation for the next, making this house of cards a great teaching tool--as a model of how NOT to think critically.<br />Is Menzies hypothesis true?  I have no idea, and this book certainly proves nothing either way.
B00005B36H|5.0|What can be said about Tool that hasn't been said before? Tool are at the forefront of rock music as one of the most (if not the most) talented, original and creative bands ever, and &quot;Lateralus&quot; is no different.<br />Whereas &quot;Aenima&quot; was a probing into the need for spiritual cleansing, adding abrasive elements to their throttling gut rock, &quot;Lateralus&quot; is the cry of a band who have thrown the rulbook out the window, and have created something entirely for itself. From the opening grinds of &quot;The Grudge&quot; to the closing static and disembodied voices of &quot;Faaip de Oiad&quot; this record is nothing short of brilliance.<br />If you don't own this record, you should be ashamed.
0393317552|5.0|I found Guns, Germs &amp; Steel full of profound insight into human prehistory and history. Diamond's overriding thesis is that accidents of geography are among the chief root causes in why civilizations in different parts of the world achieved varying levels in different factors important for societal survival and competitiveness - factors such as guns, germs and steel. This gets much more involved and convincing than I had thought of on first impression. For instance, one of the first factors enabling greater population growth was the domestication of cereals, which depended on having access to wild cereal plants predisposed for successful domestication and nutritive value. That access in turn depended largely on how great a contiguous area of similar climate was available. In that regard, Eurasia had a vast advantage over sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. The domestication of cereals is thought to have taken place independently in the Fertile Crescent, with wheat and barley, and in China, with millet on the Yellow River and rice on the Yangtze River. Meanwhile, the Americas were so lacking in a decent cereal that the natives around southern Mexico domesticated corn, which had to change a great deal more than its wild ancestor, and which even then remains nutritively inferior to wheat, with its significant protein content. Meanwhile New Guinea is thought to have developed agriculture on its own as well, and domesticated sugarcane, but simply had no option of a cereal or good plant protein source to cultivate.<br />On it goes, into domesticable animals, developing epidemic germs that evolved from germs affecting the those domesticated animals, and simply having the great contiguous stage of Eurasia in which inventions and ideas could disseminate from a vast pool of experience.<br />Diamond emphasizes the falsehood of the common rationale of racism, that historical differences in hallmarks of civilization are due to differences in inate ability between differentethnic groups. Instead, any redistribution of our ancestors ten thousand years ago among the different parts of the Earth would likely have led to the inhabitants of the same areas developing similarly more sophisticated civilizations and similar competitive advantages, based on geography, rather than on the remarkably little genetic diversity there is between different human populations.<br />He also emphasizes the historical universality, if tragedy, of tilted competitive readiness between interacting societies leading to epidemic, subjugation, and sometimes annihilation of the less competitive group. Far from the sort of view expressed by George Carlin's tirade against blue-eyed invaders, ethnic displacement is not a sin unique to Europeans, but also took place in the invasion of the Chatham Islands by the Maori of New Zealand, by repeated invasions of southeast Asia and the Pacific islands by natives of southern China, of southern China by northern China, of the Congo and Kalahari areas of Africa by Bantu Africans originating from what is now eastern Nigeria and Cameroon, and even of the ancient Middle East by Ethiopians, in the origin of the Semites - both Jews and Arabs included. Tragic aspects of human history are easier to remedy when their reality is better understood.<br />Diamond seems ambivalent on the &quot;progress&quot; of civilization - as he insists on putting in quotation marks. He sets forth convincingly how large-scale societal structure is an absolutely inevitable consequence of high population density, and frequently characterizes it as the rise of a parasite class of leaders, bureaucrats, and priests who leach off the productive capacity of the food producers and make large-scale war possible. On the other hand, he characterizes - again, convincingly - stone age cultures, including the few remaining today and the ones that included all of humanity in prehistory, as being dominated by violence between and within the tribe, claiming that the twomost prevalent causes of death in pre-civilized cultures are tribal warfare and homicide. With that perspective, he indicates organized society's greatest strength as its ability to deter war and violence through military strength and effective law enforcement and administration of justice.<br />Diamond's quest is to make history a true historical science, on par with geology and astronomy. Unfortunately, he detracts from his proclamation of this agenda in the last chapter by launching an ill-informed denigration of the physical sciences as uninterested in purpose and function or in root causes, which was enough to break the appearance of omniscience created by his earlier mastery of so many disparate fields - he is apparently an active researcher in both physiology and evolutionary biology - and indicate that there are after all some scholarly fields about which he is ignorant. He also admits that his emphasis on geography as the prime driver of human civilizations has no power to explain some historical quirks, such as the historical voluntary abandonment by entire societies of fantastic competitive advantages, including the abandonment of pottery by the Polynesians, of guns by the Japanese, and of ocean-circumnavigating fleets by the Chinese. But despite these shortcomings, this book could represent another example of Edward O. Wilson's Consilience in making dramatic new progress in a field by synthesizing learning from disparate fields together. I tend to see the hand of Wilson everywhere, but the connection is too appropriate not to point out. For that is the program that Diamond follows, drawing on advances in archaeology, linguistics, and especially genetics, subjected to new applications of analysis and logic, in synthesizing a study of history based on analytical patterns of causation. This study provides wonderful dividends of insight into the grand sweep of human affairs.<br />Finally of course, I have to pose the question: if the ultimate success or failure of any human society throughout history is consistently decided on the geographical resources available to it, more than any other factor: what does that have to say about the first-ever opportunity of our own civilization to colonize other worlds away from Earth?
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is one of the movies you can watch over and over and over again (you should also see the live stage production if you have the chance). The music is fabulous - from hard rockin' to touching ballads.  It's a moving story that will make you laugh and cry, really.  It's silly and moving.  There is wonderful witty dialogue, great costumes, fabulous singing and acting ... it's just an all around great movie.
0195067142|5.0|&quot;With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa&quot; by Eugene B. Sledge was highly recommended by a graduate student in Military History who insisted on this is the best memoir book on World War II available. Eugene B. Sledge or known as Sledgehammer by his fellow Marines provided a detailed account of the battles in Peleliu and Okinawa which was both horrifying and insightful. Sledge started off the book with his boot camp training and how he discontinued his officer training program to participate in the war as an enlisted man.<br />The descriptions that Sledge provided was unbelievably vivid. He described the terrified feeling of being constantly shelled by the enemy while staying in the foxhole, of running in the open space while being shot at and having to live in a dirty, and muddy condition. The part that really got my attention was when he described the dead bodies of men, deteriorating beyond recognition and the stench that filled the air.<br />&quot;With the Old Breed&quot; is written in a simple way to tell a very complicating story. Sledge did not use too many military jargons that might confused the average readers. This book provides a very detailed description of life during war. In addition, the book also revealed the close bonds that were formed among the marines and how they came to value each other. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about a soldier's life during World War II, particularly the pacific theater.
B000063UR1|2.0|Briefly, Silent Running is set in the distant future where Earth's forests, because of pollution, have been transplanted to large terrarium-like domes orbiting Saturn on a trio of space cruisers.  When the ships are recalled to Earth for commercial service and the domes ordered destroyed, one of the crewmen takes action to preserve the trees and plants he has spent the last eight years caring for.<br />Silent Running has a number of problems:  the shaky premise, the underdeveloped script, poor characterization, Peter Schickele's all-thumbs score (the very opposite of subtle) and two horribly dated songs from Joan Baez.  The cinematography is about competent for television in the early 70s, which is to say rather flat and unengaging.  Despite his involvement in the visuals for 2001, director Douglas Trumbull strains under the restraints of his million dollar budget to make the special effects believable.  Bruce Dern is typically overreaching -- compare Edward G. Robinson's short, understated reminiscence about how Earth used to be near the beginning of \\"Soylent Green\\" with Dern's harangue on a similar theme here -- and his character, Freeman Lowell, is, quite frankly, a rather annoying nut case.<br />Still, there are two compelling reasons to see this movie.  The first is the backgrounds:  most of the interiors were shot aboard a decommissioned battle cruiser, lending a sense of cramped realism to the film.  The control room, radio chatter and all, seems especially believable (at least when the oscilloscopes aren't in the frame).  The domes, only small sections of which could be shown because of budgetary considerations, are an interesting idea that plays out well visually.<br />The second and best reason to see Silent Running, though, is its take on one of science fiction's tried and true conventions, the robot.  The \\"drones,\\" as they are called here, are admittedly technically impractical, but their design and execution are  rendered with an affecting pathos.  They're not simply cute; they're clunky and slow (but efficient) and possess a mute humanity that the actors can't summon.  They are perhaps so enduring as characters because the viewer empathizes for them in their long-suffering, duty-bound roles.  Or maybe we just feel how hard it must be for them to be stuck on a space ship with Bruce Dern.  Either way, the drones are a brilliant touch, and they are the element of this film that works the best.<br />Extras on the DVD include a rather dully narrated, contemporaneously produced documentary about making of the film which shows more of the battle cruiser and gives some good insight into how the drones were done.  Other features include more recent interviews with Douglas Trumbull and Bruce Dern, neither of which are very insightful (filmographies would have been nice, but none are included, and the passing discussion with Trumbull about working with Kubrick on 2001 only begs more on the subject).<br />Science fiction fans will want this one for its cult value and its unique place in the canon of downbeat sci fi from the early 70s, but those with only a passing curiosity may just want to rent.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Great CD of classic blues covers mixed with 3 Joe originals.  Joe, Eric, and Kenny are as tight as ever here.  Highlights include \\"You Upset Me Baby\\" (BB King), \\"Burning Hell\\" (John Lee Hooker), \\"Blues Deluxe\\" (Jeff Beck), \\"Man of Many Words\\" (Buddy Guy), \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" (Joe Bonamassa), \\"I Don't Live Anywhere\\" (Joe B.), \\"Wild About You Baby\\" (Elmore James), \\"Long Distance Blues\\" (T-Bone Walker), \\"Pack It Up\\" (Freddie King), \\"Left Overs\\" (Albert Collins), and \\"Walking Blues\\" (inspired by Robert Johnson).  What a great blues tribute cd, rocked up by Joe and company!
6305696071|1.0|This is fantastic film, let down by a really poor audio track.  Part of this is my fault for not noticing that this DVD is Dolby Surround 2.0 and NOT Dolby Digital 5.1.  WHY!!! the boxed set with Runaway Bride WAS Dolby Digital 5.1 and great quality, unfortunately it was sold out before I got a chance to get a copy.  In addition the sound level on the Audio is at least 50% lower than any other DVD I have and very thin in quality with little bass.<br />As for the movie itself I was expecting an uncut original version of the Film as nowhere did it indicate that the 10th Anniversary edition had been changed from the original.  Imagine my surprise when the the introduction says that the film has been modified from the original version and has been edited for content, again WHY!!! the boxed set wasn't.<br />My advice is save your money for a better release than this 10th Anniversary edition.  If you can find a source of the boxed set with Runaway Bride snap it up and save me a copy while you are about it.  The boxed set was brilliant and I wish I had been quicker to buy it...
B00000K0DV|4.0|This was a surprising Fulci movie to watch.  Of course the dubbing is something not worthwhile, but the acting is surprisingly good.  It lacks much gore that his previous films contained, which is the reason why I gave this four stars, and the violence is unpleasant to watch, but it was a well-plotted movie.
B00008J4P5|2.0|I not that impressed by this album, with the notable exception of their big hit opener &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;. I guess I'm getting older, because I've seen this shtick done before and better: Think G. Love, Jon Spencer, Royal Trux, Boss Hog, Guided by Voices. On top of that, I can't believe anyone would miss the fact that they COMPLETELY and UTTERLY rip off Urge Overkill's &quot;Positively Bleeding&quot; on Track 13, with no acknowledgement.<br />This IS a listenable, decent album. The rest of it just isn't as inspired as the opener, and I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE!
B00005JLZN|4.0|To answer your question of why David Gale had to, &quot;pour out this tale of innocence to Bitsey if he knows she is going to find out the truth later on anyway&quot; is simple.  She has to believe his story that he is innocent and was not involved in the murder in anyway.  Thus she would be more passionate about telling this to the public.  Only after she reported his innocence was she let known that he was actually part of the &quot;murder conspirecy.&quot;  Also the general public will not turn against the abolitionist because they themselves dont know that he was part of the conspirecy.  Only Bitsey and she wouldnt tell anyone.  This is why Gale, Constance, and the cowboy picked her to tell the story because they knew she would would protect her sources, like when she spent 7 days in jail for not revealing a source.  There was two tapes, one showing Gale which was for Bitsey which said off the record(to let her gain her freedom of guilt of not rescuing him, because he didnt want to be recued) and one tape without him to be released to the public to show his innocence thus proving that innocent people can die with the death penalty.  Please pay attention more to the nuances of the film and giving inaccurate reviews.
B00005O3VC|5.0|A real classic. You won't stop laughing. Gotta have it.
B000093NLH|3.0|Scorps were awesome as usual, but the backing female vocalists and the other musicians were totally unecessary.  Klaus' voice is amazing and in no way needs any backing.  A few songs were quite good (&quot;Drive&quot;- the Cars cover, &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;- Kansas cover--would've been much better w/o backing musicians).  &quot;Rock You Like A Hurricane&quot; should not be done acoustically- ever.  This is not for the faint of heart!
B00000J7I3|5.0|This must be one of the coolest records I've heard. It's so raw you can even hear some mistakes, but it's still great.
0790729342|1.0|road warrior is a GREAT MOVIE, one of my all-time favorites. top-notch, AMAZING action and stunt sequences and max, in road warrior, is every bit as good as any of clint's man-w/-no-names.<br />BUT..! THIS DVD RELEASE IS BOTTOM SCUM! i give it one star because negative ratings aren't an option. first, you've got a fullscreen version on one side and a 'widescreen' on the other. what's so bad about THAT? you prob'ly ask. the 'WIDESCREEN' is the FULLSCREEN REDUCED for a 'letterbox' effect. only you get 'LETTERBOX' on ALL FOUR SIDES! and to describe the additional features as junk would be to compliment them!<br />i would rather be sitting here, this many years into dvds, wondering and bemoaning NO road warrior on dvd than having paid money for such a disrespectful handling of a classic.<br />GREAT MOVIE..? OF COURSE... but that's not what we're discussing here.<br />BOTTOM LINE: WAIT FOR A PROPER DVD TREATMENT, like the se mad max dvd. if you CAN'T wait and HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE IT... buy it used... CHEAP!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I had to buy this movie as soon as it came out.  Besides the film being one of the greatest movies ever made, the special features help to complete the package.  You have to buy this DVD to see the footage about The Return of the King!!!!!!
B000060P79|1.0|Little preppy kids, this is NOT punk, this is pure pop with guitars. I can't stand this group, they sound like all the other pop bands out there like bad charlotte, sum 41, and blink 182. There is no orginality here, all the songs sound the same. these guys are as punk as NSTYNC. If you want to listen to real punk rock get a Dead kennedys, rancid, bad religon or sex pistols cd!
B00007LTIC|5.0|This album was my introduction to Yes way back in 1977.  I owned the vinyl, I own the recent remaster, but this edition completely and utterly makes them obsolete.  I hoped the new mastering would be good, but not this good!  I actually heard noises and sounds in the songs that I never heard (like Jon humming along to Howe's solo in &quot;Parallels&quot;).<br />The sound quality alone should enough to convince you to replace any previous version.  But the extra tracks and the insightful liner notes are icing on the cake.  &quot;Montreaux's Theme&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; were previously released.  &quot;Vevey (Revisited)&quot;, released in an edited form in the past, in here in full.  The rehersals, especially for the vastly underrated &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; are really great.<br />It's about time that we have a Yes renaissance, and picking up the original studio albums with this quality (and at this price) are a great way to begin.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is an excellent guitarist who mixes beats while still remaining true to his guitarist/singer genre.  His feel is classic like Elton John's Your Song while jazzy and fresh with a sound similar to Dave as he is often compared and yet strikingly his own.  I find myself listening to him simply to hear what he will come up with next.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Over the next few years, \\"Jane Doe\\" may well come to be looked upon as one of those albums that change the way people look at music.  Although Converge lean more toward the hardcore side of the heavy-music equation than such bands as Meshuggah, the Dillinger Escape Plan, and Soilent Green, their essential mission is the same.  Like their metal counterparts mentioned above, Converge fuse mammoth heaviness with uncharacteristic levels of intelligence and musicianship, churning out jarring song structures and mutating time signatures without abandoning the aggression at the core of their genre.<br />On \\"Jane Doe,\\" their most recent album, Converge demonstrate songwriting and instrumental chops that blow away almost anything I've heard in any genre, period.  \\"Heaven In Her Arms\\" is doubtless one of the most maniacal compositions in the history of popular music, and tunes like \\"Concubine,\\" \\"Fault And Fracture,\\" and \\"Homewrecker\\" aren't far behind.  Jacob Bannon's harsh, unintelligible shrieks may take some getting used to, but their raw power and visceral impact are undeniable.  Besides, they perfectly match the music, which is nothing short of astonishing.  The guitars manage to find a completely harmonious balance of math-metal heaviness and hardcore brutality, and Ben Koller's drumming is positively sick.<br />Remarkably, when the band slows things down, it's every bit as effective as the heavy stuff.  Songs like \\"Distance And Meaning,\\" \\"Hell To Pay,\\" and \\"Phoenix In Flight\\" substitute a doomy, genuinely creepy atmosphere and snatches of melody for the sonic carnage that's typically on display.  The result is a genre-busting album that is as eclectic as it is creative.<br />And then there's the closing title track, which is an awe-inspiring culmination of everything that's come before it.  Clocking in at more than eleven minutes, it's a mountainous epic that grabs your attention from the first note and never lets go.  Between Jacob's mix of tortured screams and soaring clean vocals, and the band's intricate and enthralling music, this song contains more power than most bands will be lucky to summon up in an entire career.  With \\"Jane Doe\\" (both the song and the album), Converge have both stepped outside the hardcore genre and maintained a solid rooting in it, resulting in brilliant music that all open-minded listeners should be able to enjoy.  Period.ing clean vocals, and the band's intricate and enthralling music, this song contains more power than most bands will be lucky to summon up in an entire career.

B00009ATIX|5.0|I have wanted to see this film since its release. And I just finished watching it. Even though it was a box-office bomb and had negative reviews. I have to say that it is one of the best science fiction films I have ever seen (next to Gattaca). The movie was not what I expected but it is a slow moving piece of art in which you have to think. Some people don't like to watch movies that you have to think about but this film is so filled with powerful emotion and desperation that it overpowered me. And its so beautifully crafted, including the acting, directing, and also score. This score, I know I would buy. I think that this film is a lost classic. And to reviews who say that this movie is Hogwash are wrong. I absolutly loved this movie but you have to understand that this is a very deep, quiet and at times confusing type of movie. But I feel in love with the quiet mystical planet called Solaris
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's OK Computer is, in my opinion, the best album of the 1990's.  Try to find another album that captures the time period in which is was crafter so eloquently.  A nervous sense of pre-millenial tension holds the album in its grasp, and slowly leaks into the listener.  The band also explores the rapid spread of technology into our lives, especially through the internet, as well as into music, and the band's use of more electronica and analog sounds complements this ideal with a sense of irony.<br />Paranoid Andriod is a six minute masterpiece; its rapid tempo shifts and lack of a chorus make it a complex song that manages to retain beauty, starting off almost as an acoustic number and then meandering through peaks and valleys until it finally breaks down in a chaotic, screaming mass of guitars and noise.  The song touches on the dehumanization of people, being copies of each other and slaves to society and pop culture, and said breakdown almost perfectly captures that mental anguish.<br />Karma Police is also about man against society, providing a haunting narrative about the majority being able to crush the nonconformist minorty.  Its simple piano-based structure gives it a very haunting feel, and, near the end, with the reverb of Thom Yorke's voice sighing, one almost feels a sense of freedom and of escaping the establishment, reliazing that you were trapped, that \\"For a minute there, I lost myself.\\" Beautiful.<br />Electioneering is the only true rocker on the album, and way ahead of its time, prophetic if you will: its sarcastic sneer at politics and politicians' ambiguousness foreshadows the 2000 election fiasco.<br />Finally, there is my personal favorite: CLimibing Up The Walls.  ITs hard to say what this song is about: a stalker, a man with mental problems, love, fear in it purest form, but it doesn;t really matter.  The song is scary, and it makes my hair stand up each time I hear it.  The slow, sludgy melody, ominous background noise, and eerie chimes, combined with Yorke's ethereal voice sincing about climbing up the inside of your skull...it is the only song ever to elicite such a strong gut response from me.  And somehow, that makes it the most human of all the rough robotics of OKC.  Even more strangely, it makes the song sexy...the last theme one owuld expect to find on such a drear, but marvelous, album.
B0000399WI|5.0|Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins) is a well educated banker that is wrongly convicted of killing his wife. Sent to Shawshank Prison to serve a life sentence, Andy starts out having a hard time and existing only in appearance. That is until he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman)- the man in Shawshank that can get you anything. Andy and Red soon become the best of friends. Andy's demeanour and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look within himself, and the world around him, while Andy proves to all the inmates at Shawshank that hope and determination can get you through even the cruelest of circumstances.<br />Everything about this film, from the directing to the musical score, is absolutely flawless. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella &quot; Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&quot; is absolutely incredible. The adaption is so good, that the film manages to be even better, because the story is too rich to be limited to a 100 page short story, and the film puts it on much grander scale. Darabont really shows how much emotion a musical score can get from the audience. It is one of the best I have ever heard, and it really drives the film. The story itself deals with the concepts of hope and freedom. They are the concepts of humanity which everyone wants, and it gives the film a more personal feel. These concepts are so intricately drawn into the plot, that the audience can't help being drawn in to the film. <br />The actors are do a phenomenal job. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give the performances of their careers. The warden played by Bob Gunton is outstanding because of how well he plays both sides of his character. He claims to be highly religious, but shows his truly dispicable nature at the same time. Great two face character! James Whitmore does a great job with Brooks Hatlen. &quot;Brooks is an institutional man now&quot;. His performance acturately portrays how a person can come to depend on the environment around them. Other great performances are given by William Sadler as Haywood, Clancy Brown as Captain Byron Hadley, and Gil Bellows as Tommy Williams. <br />&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; has it all - a great script with an identical adaptation, outstanding direction, amazing performances, thought provoking concepts of the human condition, and a briliant musical score. In 148 minutes running, the film manages to become a masterpiece that is one of a kind. Truly unforgettable film!
B000002UB3|5.0|Just noticed that none of The Beatles' albums have a 5 star rating.  This is sad, sad news.  The Beatles transformed music into everything we know today.  Just think: before The Beatles, that old 50's rock n' roll was considered avant garde.  Their music opened the doors for all the great music to follow.  Abbey Road was their last recording.  For that reason alone it should be praised.  It was the end of an era, and the world of music will never have another band even close to what The Beatles were.  How about having a little respect for the fathers of the last 40 years of great music.
B00005PJ8I|3.0|Cast Away is a good movie, but not so compelling.<br />The script is pretty much predicable.<br />Of course, the main character must be rescued.<br />The only question, will he get his girl back?<br />I wont spoil the ending for you.
B00008NRI9|2.0|Both my daughter and I looked forward to seeing this film. I am a big fan of both Sandra Bullocks and Hugh Grant, as they are charismatic and talented actors with a feel for comedy. Unfortunately, even they cannot overcome a witless script and the ham-handed direction of Marc Lawrence.<br />Sandra Bullock plays the role of neurotic Lucy Kelson, a Harvard Law School grad who follows in the footsteps of her activist parents by becoming an activist lawyer.  Hugh Grant is in his element as George Wade, a real estate developer and playboy tycoon. When they are brought together by fate,  they strike a deal that they believe would be in each of their respective best interests. Lucy will work for George as his chief counsel, while George promises not to apply the wrecker's ball to her beloved Coney Island community center.<br />Unfortunately, as time passes, these two opposites begin to be attracted to each other. Just as fate contrived to bring them together, however, it appears that fate will also tear them apart. When Lucy discovers that George will be unable to keep his promise about the Coney Island community center, she gives him two weeks notice. Enter June Carter (Alicia Witt), also a Harvard Law grad and Lucy's replacement. The luscious June quickly sizes up George Wade and sets her cap for him, causing Lucy to suffer pangs of jealousy of which she had been previously unaware.<br />There are no surprises in this formulaic film. Hugh Grant does his slightly wacky British turn, while Sandra Bullocks  turns in another intelligently ditzy, infectious performance.  It is the script and the direction, however, not the actors, that jettison this remarkably unfunny, romantic comedy. The laughs are few and far between. The dialogue is one dimensional and cartoonish. It fails to build a believable romance between the two main characters. Quite frankly, all the film does is waste the considerable talents of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullocks, as well as the viewer's time. It is an unintelligent, pedestrian film that would otherwise have tanked but for its star power.n unintelligent, pedestrian film that would otherwise have tanked but for its star power.

B00005JKZU|1.0|After the perfectly plotted, seamlessly edited Fellowship, the scattered, unfaithful, and frequently confusing Two Towers is not merely an artistic disappointment, but also cause for a falling out with Peter Jackson's vision. We see much, but in several small parts--the DVD lists more than 50 scenes--not all of which cohere or have sufficient time to explore the developments of the characters or the depths of Tolkien's theme; the writers and director seem to have tried to compensate by inserting several brief melodramatic bits of dialogue that are so anomalous that they come out almost farcically. Perhaps the film is best symbolized by Sean Astin; not only have his acting and pseudo-British accent degraded since the first film, but he is given several calculatingly sappy lines that, at the conclusion of a long and difficult-to-appreciate story, are downright outrageous. While Elijah Wood shines for his increasingly confident and even mature acting, he cannot make up for poor writing, directing, and editing. This is literary adaptation at its very worst. But what is perhaps even more disturbing than the adaptation are the reviews here at amazon.com; why is ignorance about books and authors--and anti-Tolkienism in particular--being touted by customers at a website that earned its fame by selling books? Have we become so foolish? I recommend [...] for reviews that tend to be written by people who remember that the author of The Two Towers was Tolkien, not Jackson. I look forward to the \\"Return\\" hesitantly, with little faith; I hope that the final film reawakens the enjoyment that I experienced when viewing \\"Fellowship.\\"

B00008H2LE|5.0|That's truly the only word for this cd to me. I started off -HATING- Linkin Park, just from what I'd heard about it. I'm the type who's heavily into Rob Zombie and Older Metallica. And when I -finally- was in the car and 'In The End' came on, my significant other said 'THIS is Linkin Park!' and after that I was hooked. I purchased their second album yesterday with a bit of fright. Alot of people had been saying it was so close to hybrid theory it was basically a clone. Granted some of the tracks have the same feel, there's -nothing- wrong with that! <br />People tend to complain when someone changes their sound so much that they sound completely different. Well Linkin Park has made ANOTHER excellent album, and if it has some of the same feel of the first, that's even better. They know who they are, and they've gotten louder, stronger, and more creative. <br />By far my favorite song on this album is 'Faint'. It was the first song I heard off this album, and at first I was a little iffy about it, debating if it was really all that good. But upon further listening, and more understanding of the lyrics, I quickly embraced it, as I have steadily done with every song in the thousand times I've listened to them since yesterday. Amazing songs, Amazing DVD, Amazing band.

B0000AM6K2|5.0|I think this is the most upbeat, enjoyable CD that Josh has put out.  My only critique of his older stuff is that it could become a little monotonous and mellow.  This CD has a cool 70s groove with great lyrics and melodies.
B0000AI44Q|1.0|Say this much for Neil Young:  he doesn't stand still.  Alternating for the most part between furious, cathartic rocker and rustic country/folk troubadour, Young has nevertheless thrown enough curveballs in his career to amaze and confound even his most devoted fans.  His 1980's forays into electronica (\\"Trans\\") and rockabilly (\\"Everybody's Rockin\\") left most listeners shaking their heads.  \\"Greendale,\\" his latest effort, is a doozy of a curveball as well.  Unfortunately, he grooves it right over the heart of the plate.  It's long and slow, and there's no hook.  <br />A concept album featuring a massively muddled concept, \\"Greendale\\" purports to tell the story of the Green family, who reside in the fictional title town that appears to represent Young's view of all that is right and idyllic in America.  Grandpa Earl, Grandma Edith, and grandkids Jed and Sun peacefully commune with nature in one long Summer of Love until a tragedy occurs and the peaceful idyll is shattered.  Jed, a drug runner, shoots and kills a cop named Carmichael.  Then all hell breaks loose.  The media show up in Greendale, causing Grandpa to rail against the Internet and extol the wonders of old TV shows like \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" and eventually keel over and die of apoplexy.  The FBI shows up, puts Jed in jail, and shoots Sun Green's cat, which causes Sun to freak out, chaining herself to an office building while shouting through a megaphone about political corruption, the wonders of marijuana, and the destruction of the ecosystem.  Sun eventually hightails it to Alaska with one Earth Brown, where they exhort us, in the grand finale, to \\"save the planet for another day\\" and \\"be the river as it rolls along.\\"  Whew.  Did I mention the cameo appearances from Satan and Wayne Newton (no relation)?  <br />All of this could be viewed in a slightly bemused way as Neil just being Neil if the music was any good, but it's not.  Young and longtime bandmates Crazy Horse have made incendiary rock `n roll in the past, but this time raw and rootsy merely sounds underdeveloped and unrehearsed.  Young borrows the chord changes from Dylan's \\"My Back Pages\\" for about the fiftieth time in his career on a couple songs, and some rudimentary John Lee Hooker blues riffs on a couple others, but all of it sounds dispirited, and the trademark searing guitar solos are noticeably absent.  For the most part, the music merely serves as a backdrop for Young's lyrical screeds.  And at nearly 80 minutes in length, these screeds do go on and on.  <br />At the mid-way point of the mess Young sings, \\"That guy who keeps on singing/Someone shut him up/I don't know for the life of me/Where he comes up with this stuff.\\"<br />You got that right, bro.  Consider me amazed and confounded.
0385504209|4.0|Along with &quot;Charm School&quot; by Nelson DeMille, this is a book I could not put down.  It is painful to part company with this fantastic tale.  It is so believable, I became confused between what is fact and fiction...I had to find a copy of &quot;The Last Supper&quot; painting to confirm a major crux of this story, it is that believable.  As the plot twists and turns, I was so wrapped in the story, I found myself dreading the worst for the protagonists despite &quot;knowing&quot; that the book had to go on.  I cannot rate this book high enough...I'm almost sure Dan Brown's other books won't be as good, but I intend to read them all to find out.
B00009MGQL|5.0|After buying this cd and taking a first listen, my initial thoughts were this: ELIMINATE THE VOCAL INTRUSION! And my feelings on this remain the same after listening to it again and again. Too many of his songs are ruined by vocals that are not needed. If the voice don't say it, the guitar will play it! The best songs include: So What, Pork-U-Pine, Seasons, Trouble Man, Line Dancing With Monkeys, JB's Blues, Bulgaria, and Why Lord Oh Why.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Since the release of THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION in 1990,Madonna has scored many more hits. Her teen idol days have long been over and in certain aspects,she matured.

From that album include BEDTIME STORY,HUMAN NATURE,TAKE A BOW and SECRET. There are more of her showtunes in this collection.

B00008J4P5|4.0|Superior to their previous release, &quot;Elephant&quot; is a rocking and awesome album from start to finish. Whereas &quot;White Blood Cells (Sympathy For The Recording Industry)&quot; became repetitive and tiring after the first half, this record stays strong and vibrant throughout.<br />Even though their style is classified as minimalist, the sound is anything but. Jack and Meg White vary things up in just the right order and amount, bouncing between wailing on their instruments and keeping things to barely above a whisper. Stand out tracks, in my opinion, are &quot;I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself,&quot; &quot;The Hardest Button To Button,&quot; and the terrific 7-minute, screamin' blues track &quot;Ball And Biscuit.&quot;<br />I was planning on passing up this release after being disappointed by the hype surrounding &quot;White Blood Cells,&quot; but &quot;Elephant&quot; is not a CD to forget picking up.
B0000A02TZ|3.0|The DVD release of Animal House contains an excellent digital transfer, great sound, and ok special features, but why oh Good GRIEF WHY!? do I have to watch the trailers every time I put it into the DVD player??<br />The movie is great, its a lot of fun, I got to see boobies and hear the curse words finally after having watched the movie edited to pieces practically every weekend of my teen years on USA or TBS, the humor still holds up and I wish I worked at Faber. <br />HOWEVER, it's decidedly annoying to have to sit through 5 minutes of trailers without any &quot;out.&quot; It is nonsense to pay for an item and then have adverts forced upon me. Sad thing is, all the titles advertised I would consider purchasing, but now, on principle, I won't. <br />Universal Home Video, Stop doing this, its off-putting to watch trailers that are &quot;hardwired&quot; into the DVD presentation.

Pilot: The introduction to the show sets up what would follow in the eighteen epoisode that followed.<BR>2. The episode where there is a shooting at the school. A definte problem in the latter half of the ninties, this epiosode showcases how ahead of its time this show was.<BR>3. The epiosode where Rayanne overdoses of ecstasy and too much alcohol. Shows shy away from the subject of teen substance abuse, but not this one, which showcased it with sadness and a little bit of horror at the same time.<BR>4. The epiosode where Rayanne joins Frozen Embroys. If jsut to see Jared Leto, pre-30 Seconds to mars-singing the Ramones. Funny.<BR>5. The epiosode where Rayanne and Jared Leto, uhm, get it on. The repricotions of the action are shown with such honesty, its amazing that the creator of this show wasn't a teen herself when she created this show.
0201633612|5.0|Mr.Landonmkelsey, Have you ever heard about software design before? From all your comments I can learn that you have not done any design or analysis before coding (look at the review for c# book just right into the code). UML and Design patterns is for software architects. When you build your house do you just jump and start building. You need to analyze, design, plan and use existing patterns before building. It is amazing that they are able to bring patterns for software. Learn it now are you will be lost.

The other tracks are excellent as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just read in Hollywood Reporter that a feature film version of Firefly has been green-lit by Universal (who acquired the rights from 20th Century Fox)! I'd suggest buying this DVD set and getting acquainted with the characters before seeing the film.<br />Firefly, right off the bat, had compelling, complex characters, extraordinary SFX (which, instead of substituting for good writing, served only to create a realistic, gritty atmosphere), and a nuanced premise that was unique among the space opera genre. It managed to create action and suspense without the usual laser-filled space battles.<br />Buy the DVD, and go see the movie when it hits the theaters. Who knows, if it all sells well, maybe Universal (which may soon be owned by NBC) will revive it as a series in the future for NBC or Sci Fi Channel.<br />If not, at least you'll get to see all the episodes in the correct order, unlike the way they were shown on Fox.
B00009P1O5|4.0|I liked this review of this album because it really gave me a sense of what the album is all about. The description of the guitar sounds in particular was very helpful to me. However, as much as I enjoyed this review, I don't think other rock albums could &quot;vote&quot;, per say, for this album to be their king, since kings, technically, are not elected, but generally pre-ordained by birthright or forcibly established with military victories. Still, the point of the review is well taken: this is a great album. And my point is this: that was a great review!

B00007JVBI|4.0|This album holds sentimental value for me as Cat Power seems to have been always playing in the backround during the more trying times of my life in the last few years. While Moon Pix was good I prefer this album on the strength of its melodies. The songs are uniformly depressing and soul-sapping but excellent throughout. If the lyrics to &quot;Names&quot; don't make your skin crawl then you aren't human. I saw Chan Marshall perform here in Miami about 2 years ago and she was as fragile and bizarre in person as she comes across on her albums. The venue was very small and intimate and it was a perfect opportunity to soak in the music as it was intended to be heard. Highly recommended.
B000002NJS|4.0|The very beautiful Madonna strikes again with 1998's RAY OF LIGHT. This was a best-seller spawning hits such as the title track,FROZEN,THE POWER OF GOODBYE, and DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE. They're all on GHV2(Greatest Hits Volume 2). The video for RAY OF LIGHT was totally awesome,I must admit.
B0000584V3|5.0|You know, something?  I never really liked death metal vocals. I always thought it was pointless screaming by the lead singer to make up for his lack of vocal prowess.  There is one exception to this rule, and his name is Mikael Akerfeldt.  Akerfeldt is the singer, rhythm/acoustic guitarist, and all-around head honcho of Opeth, a band from Sweden that also consists of Peter Lindgren (lead guitar), Martin Lopez (drums), and Martin Mendez (bass).  Mikael is the only death metal singer I'll enjoy listening to because even when his growls and screams become extremely intense, he has a certain flow that most of the &quot;singers&quot; in that genre lack.  Not to mention, he also writes some of the best lyrics this side of Neil Peart. All of this leads to my first Opeth purchase, BLACKWATER PARK.<br />This is the band's fifth album (or &quot;movement,&quot; as they call it), and considered by many to be the band's best.  As with any first purchase, I can't judge and say that it's the band's best, but I love what Opeth have accomplished with BLACKWATER PARK: dense, harsh, and very moving epic songs combining the brutality of death metal, the gentle acoustics of folk music, and the complexity of '70s progressive rock into one tight package.  This is Opeth's signature sound, but it never gets old.  There is so much unpredictability in their music that I was constantly surprised throughout the 67-minute duration of this disc.  We need more bands like this.<br />The musicianship is really great.  As I said before, Mikael is one of the best singers out there today.  His combination of demonic death growls and melodic angelic vocals is stunning, and he plays one mean acoustic guitar.  Martin Mendez is a great bassist with a killer sense of groove, and Martin Lopez combines ambient snare drum work with ferocious metal precision.  Peter Lindgren unleashes some pretty heavy yet melodic leads and solos that have a tinge of blues in them.  Very cool.<br />There's no need to explain the 8 songs on here, since they all have the familiar Opeth touch to them that I mentioned in describing their sound.  You have to hear this album and then become it.  Do expect some pleasant surprises, like stoner rock jams, straightfoward riffs mixed with the more complex ones, a constant and sudden switch between dark and light, and even some psychedelic underpinnings.<br />BLACKWATER PARK has everything a metal fan or (especially) a prog. fan could want.  This proves why Opeth are one of the greatest bands to emerge in the modern prog scene in quite some time.

The research put into this book is evident throughout with each example being thoroughly supported with data. The team highlights upfront that the reader may find reasons why some examples do not apply to them since the subset was so small. However, as you read through the pages, you will quickly discover that much more is applicable than you might suspect. Jim's care is also evident in making this a very readable and enjoyable book. The material is presented in ways that will make much of it memorable.
B000000JO3|5.0|This album is outstanding from beginning to end. I would argue that Minor Threat was the best 80's hardcore punk band, outshining their contemporaries like Black Flag and Youth of Today by a decent margin. The music, aided by Fugazi's unrelenting idealism and straight edge ethos, is uncompromising and distilled. Punk doesn't come anymore pure or potent than this. This is the real deal as opposed to the [stuff] that populated MTV and the airwaves during the \\"alternative\\" 90's.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown has written a page turner added a little panache to the genre of thrillers.  This one's a thriller jacketed in a web of art history, age-old religious mystery, and who-dunnit Alfred Hitchcockery.  The writing is simplistic and definitely doesn't get in the way of turning the pages.  Which works well for those feeding on the thrill, but less well for those thrilled by the well-turned phrase.  But the world needs summer beach books, rainy weekenders, and lazy fall leaves turning pages on the metro.  Literary high art it's not, this we've established, but the world has it's place for, \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" and it's a rather entertaining place at that.<br />The character names are pure genre and comically laughable...there's Sophie Neveau the brainy damsel in distress, there's Robert Langdon/Indiana Jones/Jack Ryan as the American in the middle of it all, and there's even Leigh Teabing as the eccentric rich British Knight Historian to add color.  The strength of this book really is Dan Brown's religious conspiracy theory modeling behind a thriller with codes and puzzles.  It's a fetching formula that hasn't been very often previously postured in other thrillers.<br />Brown does fringe the line of pseudo-intellectualism gone bad though as he references current cultural fare to prove a point...Kubrik's \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" proves secret society sex rituals among other modern movies.  It detracts from the purloined pace like a badly placed intermission.<br />Don't let these minor critiques put you off though.  I thoroughly enjoyed Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" and it kept me engaged from beginning to end.  Do you have a Eurorail pass?  This might make perfect reading on the night train from Florence to Rome.

More crappy \\"reality TV?\\"  And now it seems they aren't actually working on the DVD of Firefly?  Seriously, FOX is wicked retarded.  If they do release this, I will be buying it immediately, considering what a great show this was.  I'd recommend everyone do the same.<br /><br />So it's now much later, and they've put the DVD out on the market.  I love this show.  I even got my girlfriend to watch it with me, and SHE loves it!  More than anything, this is a show with incredible character development, which is the major appeal to the show.  Anyone who watched it probably loved it, regardless of whether or not they are a sci-fi fan.  It was just quality television.  And I'm really really glad they released it on DVD.  Thanks.
B000002UAU|5.0|Oh, please.  Reading some of the one-star reviews is actually offensive.  This album is incredible, an undeniable masterpiece.  For those who say it had no influence on popular music, compare music before 1967 to music after 1967.  That should be a good measure for those who criticize this album for not being enough like Hendrix or Cream.  Another thing: Hendrix was a great, absolutely incredible talent.  But he was making music.  Sure, the playing was an art of sorts, but the songs were still about foxy ladies and drugs.  The same with Cream.  What so many fail to comprehend is that The Beatles transcended all boundaries that had been established to make an album that was an experience.  These arent just songs about something, these are channeled emotions that erupt with a force and a style completely their own.  Jimi Hendrix could never, in a million trillion years, have written &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot;  Now, believe it or not, I dont consider my self a huge Beatles fan.  I have studied the history and making of this album, and have appraised it with a critical eye.  I am simply stating a point I hold to be correct.
B00005J9M3|5.0|If &quot;Actually&quot; represented the high point of the Pet Shop Boys' popularity, &quot;Behavior&quot; probably represents the high point of the Pet Shop Boys' artistic expression.  Here they begin to embrace (and be more straight-forward with, if you'll forgive the pun) their own identity in the artwork. In this album, the lyrics really could, in many cases, be poetry, particularly majestic songs such as &quot;Being Boring&quot;, which talks about the AIDS crisis juxtaposed against the Parisian artist-colony atmosphere of the interwar years.<br />&quot;This must be the place I've waited years to leave&quot; might win an award as the longest song title, and it has an interesting storyline that develops artistic and psychological ideas to a somber and foreboding synthesizer strain.  The electronic signature of the Pet Shop Boys is very present in this album, but rather as a background or canvas rather than as primary focus.<br />Some songs, like &quot;So Hard&quot;, play with words in double meanings.  Lyrics are clever and stylish.  This album never quite achieved the popularity of the previous two major albums, but for an artistic achievement, this album established the Pet Shop Boys as more than just a pop group -- they were recognized as serious artists.

078062565X|5.0|Hailed by many (myself included) as the greatest creature feature of all time, King Kong is a true masterwork of cinema.  Made to save RKO Studio from bankruptcy, it successfully tackles multiple themes in an enjoyable story that even most non-monster junkies will like.  Set from New York City to an uncharted isle and back again, the marvelous settings and relatable cast made audiences laugh and scream around the world in the scariest movie to date (especially the little known spider footage.)  Released four times between 1933 and 1952, much of the footage was removed from the film by censors, though most of it was restored in 1971.  Willis O&quot;Brien's special effects stunned the viewers and continues to impress today, and Max Steiner's score gives one the full intensity of the action and drama alike.  The exiting and emotional ending left few dissapointed and the film closed in one of the greatest closing lines ever, (&quot;It was beauty killed the beast.&quot;) King Kong is an undeniable masterpiece and has yet to be outdone.
B000067DNC|4.0|Great set of DVD's. They did of great job of putting together all the material into an attactive and consistant presentation. I have a 300 DVD changer with a visual contents catalog. This is one of the few DVD's that provide the catalog data for my player so I dont have to enter it manually. Always a plus. The only thing I dont like is the fact that the have the TV intro attached to the front of each episode. They should have only put on the first in my opinion. Overall I am very pleased with this DVD set.

The lyrics are original, the music is very impressive and you can play this cd from top to bottom without getting bored of it.  Avril is definitely a talent at this young age, very impressive.  She can only get better and unlike the other teenagers who started off and got big like Britney and Cristina, Avril has a sense of style that cannot be considered too poppish or commercial in any respect.  She has her own punk/alternative-pop/rock style which can only be compared the great talents as fellow canadian Alanis Morrisette.  Great cd...totally different.  This cd kept me good company on a transatlantic flight.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|In 1978, John Landis directed what is probably one of his best and most hilarious films, \\"Animal House\\".  The film focuses on fraternity and sorority life in a small college town in the 1960's.  The college's dean, Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon), is determined to shut down and expel one of the college's fraternities, the Deltas, because of their disruptive and disrespectful behavior; but the Deltas are just out to have a good time.  They include John 'Bluto' Blutarsky (John Belushi), Eric 'Otter' Stratton (Tim Matheson), Donald 'Boon' Schoenstein (Peter Riegert), Daniel Simpson 'D-Day' Day (Bruce McGill) and the two fraternity pledges Larry 'Pinto' Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent 'Flounder' Dorfman (Stephen Furst).  Members of the more respectful fraternities and sororities include Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), Mandy Pepperidge (Mary Louise Weller), Barbara 'Babs' Jansen (Martha Smith), Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) and Chip Diller (Kevin Bacon).<br />At the beginning of the film, Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfman are rejected by the \\"respectable\\" fraternities, but are accepted into the Deltas.  There, they see a very different side to college life than they otherwise would have known: lots of drinking, piles of beer cans & trash, clandestine sorority visits, wild parties and lifestyles uninhibited by society's norms.  In other words, they have a blast!  Of course, they are looked down upon by Dean Wormer, ROTC captain Neidermeyer, Greek society president Greg Marmaland, and the sorority sisters.  Some of the most memorable scenes in the film include the toga party, Bluto's sorority house visit, the Greek society meeting, visits with Dean Wormer's wife Marion (Verna Bloom) and (of course) the homecoming parade.  Other memorable characters include Katy (Karen Allen), Prof. Dave Jennings (Tom Sutherland), Mayor Carmine DePasto (Cesare Danova), Otis Day (DeWayne Jessie) and Sissy (Stacy Grooman).<br />After 25 years, \\"Animal House\\" is just as entertaining as it was when it was first released in 1978.  It has become a classic film that will never be dated.  It also became a stunning tribute to John Belushi's (1949-1982) fantastic comedic abilities.  Overall, I give \\"Animal House\\" an overwhelming 5 out of 5 stars for a great script, superb comedic acting and an engaging story that will keep you laughing throughout the film.  Just make sure that you aren't put on double secret probation yourself!it was first released in 1978.  It has become a classic film that will never be dated.

0784011176|5.0|It's the greatest movie I ever saw. I suggest you to watch this movie.  I watched it 4 times already and will watch it again sometime. <BR>:-D
B00005JKC3|5.0|the hulk is a very good movie.<BR>you never get bored, there are a lot of action and suspence.<BR>there isn t a lot of violence, usually in the movies there is a lot of blood and dead people.<BR>the actors act very weel.<BR>the special effect are very realistic too.<BR>I strongly recommended it!
0345440900|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!  It was so wonderfully useful to me that I recommend it to everyone I know is having a baby and have given it as a gift many times.  I agree that her ideas might not be revolutionary and completely original but the book puts together in one place a lot of the middle ground philosofies of &quot;scheduling&quot; (and I use the word very loosely) a baby.  Her ideas are in neither of the extremes and it is written clearly and in a very encouraging &quot;you can do it&quot; attitude.  <BR>I read many many books on getting my daughter on a routine so that I could have some sort of &quot;order&quot; in the very overwhelming and uncertain first few months of a first-time parent.  This book was the best of the lot.  I really like the fact that the book helped me figure out what my baby wanted when she cried, and not automatically assume that she was hungry.  My baby is in the 95th percentile for weight and height and has always been in that percentile so I know that I was not starving my baby.  A clear indication that food is not the answer to every crying baby.<BR>BTW, the book was very helpful not only in getting my baby on a routine and sleeping through the night but also in helping me calm my baby in situations where she was tense or uncomfortable such as riding in her car seat.  So its not just a book to help baby sleep through the night.
B00008EY9G|5.0|First of all, the first review doesnt understand the movie to its full extent and needs to watch it again.  This movie is twisted and mysterious and I will admit, a little confusing at times, but when you put it all together in the end it fits.  The ending is amazing and makes you understand what happened previously and I would recommend this movie to anyone.  I liked how both plots seemed to be just one and as a viewer i was enthralled by it.  It is one of the best movies Ive seen this year.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|This movie is a telling reenactment of an event that is ignored.  How many people know what U2 is singing about it thier similarly named song?
B000000OQF|5.0|One afternoon in 1986, I was relaxing in my bedroom after a long day at school when a song came on the radio that changed my life forever.  Between the glorious screeching of the lead singer and the unforgettable guitar riffs, it sounded like nothing I'd ever heard.  When the song was over, I listened intently until the DJ said, \\"That was `Welcome to the Jungle' by a band out of L.A. called Guns n Roses and they've just released an album titled Appetite for Destruction.\\"  I immediately called up my friend, Chris, and told him I'd just heard the most incredible song and filled him in on the details.  <br />Chris could always be counted on to do the right thing so I wasn't particularly surprised when he showed up at my parents' house that night in his beloved beige Ford Escort with a brand new cassette in its tape deck.  We picked up our Smiths-loving feminist friend, Cynthia, and headed down to Hampton.  As `It's So Easy' blasted out of the Escort's cheap speakers, Cynthia's face turned crimson and she became enraged, \\"What is this crap?\\" she yelled.  <br />\\"It's our new tape by Guns n Roses,\\" Chris said in his most soothing voice, \\"Just relax and enjoy it.\\"  <br />\\"Turn around btch, I've got a use for you!,\\" ordered Axl.  <br />That was all Cynthia could take.  \\"Turn that misogynistic sht off,\\" Cynthia screamed.  <br />Chris and I couldn't help but laugh.  Cynthia was a good friend, but not that good.  I mean we had just discovered perhaps the greatest album of all time and Cynthia wanted us to cut it off due to a few of Axl's more colorful turns of phrase.  She'd have to endure it.  And endure it she did - until \\"Rocket Queen\\" ended and we started it all over again.  Probably not a night Cynthia recalls fondly, but Chris and I sure enjoyed it.<br />Then over time, a funny thing happened.  \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" became a hit and \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" became a cultural phenomenon.  All the girls (Cynthia included) who previously despised Guns n Roses fell madly in love with them once they heard Axl serenading Erin Everly's eyes in song.  Even our classmate Jenny, a Kate Bush fan whose Sapphic tendencies were just beginning to blossom, began raving incredulously about Axl being a poet after hearing \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" on the radio.  Yes, those were pretty weird times and we have Axl, Slash, Izzy, Duff, and Steven to thank for them.<br />Appetite for Destruction provided me with a musical identity.  I'd spent the first few years of high school in the classic rock scene because that's what I heard on the radio and I didn't own any music of my own.  My mom and dad listened to classical and country, respectively, at the time and it just didn't seem possible to bring rock music into our house.  For one thing, I never really had much spending money so I just quietly listened to the radio in my room hearing the same classic rock songs over and over.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed them, but when I heard Appetite for Destruction, it was like a void had been filled within me.  As a shy person myself, Axl shouted all the things I and countless other kids like me in America wanted to shout but couldn't.  Even if I wasn't dancing with Mr. Brownstone, taking the Night Train, or dating a girl whose daddy worked in porno, at least I knew Axl was.  References to GnR became commonplace in and around our high school.  I can't tell you how many times Chris and I told Cynthia she had \\"nothing better to do\\" and that we were \\"bored\\".  At the McDonald's in Lightfoot, John Martin leaned against a refrigerator, inhaled deeply, and claimed to \\"smoke his cigarette with style.\\"<br />With Appetite for Destruction, more than for any other album in my collection, the stories and memories are endless.  For better or worse, it helped make me the person I am today.  I have always been willing to accept that different people have different opinions on music, but I remember being horrified in the 1990s when GnR became a punchline for alterna-brats.  Only a handful of bands have revolutionized popular music.  We treat the others (Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana) reverentially, why not GnR as well?  As far as I'm concerned, Appetite for Destruction is the best record released during my lifetime and probably the best rock record ever made.  \\"Take that one to heart.\\"
B000001GOZ|5.0|I shall make it short, because there are already so much excellent reviews written in favour of Boulez.<br /><br />Because I'm very sensitive for choice of tempi I didn't actually like Barbirolli's recording in which the first movement is extemely slow.<br />My attention slips away and, perhaps not fairly I put this record aside.<br /><br />Rattle, however is way too fast in the opening movement.<br />Inbal is ok, but takes the second movement (scherzo) too slow in contrast with the first movement.<br /><br />Boulez is just right.<br />Right in everything, to my ears that is.<br />I cannot say it more often, with Boulez music flows, makes sense and the drama is right there: in the music itself.<br />I love it.<br /><br />One comment:<br />I've read some reviews by a reviewer named Tony Duggan on Music Webb and there he states that any new performance must at least present the listener some questions about the music as you know it.<br />He has a point, I agree with him, that is intellectually.<br /><br />But that means I musn't like Boulez' reading because it answers the questions and fullfills almost all my wishes in this symphony.<br />Therefore it would be better for me to favour a slow Barbirolli and a speedy Rattle.<br /><br />Luckily I'm not an intellectual, and I can rank this Boulez at the top and give it 5 stars without hesitations.<br />For me the reference at this moment
B00009TB5G|5.0|No book has ever been made into a movie without there being some changes. So we embark on a journey that has some Tolkien fans pulling their hair out (Good!!) There we things that happened in FOTR that didn't happen in the book but they overlooked them I guess. Anyways Ive reviewed this moive once already so I just want to talk about what I look forward to seeing in the extended version. The Huorns are in it!!!! Holy cow all else fails to compare!! Ok and I really want to see the added stuff between Boromir, Faramir and Denethor their father.It should enrich an already great movie just as it did for the the Fellowship. I can't wait to see it.
B000002O4X|5.0|I can't say enough about this soundtrack.  It literally MADE the movie.  It's truly the most moving music I think I've ever heard.
B00005JLF5|3.0|Deep Space Nine was Star Trek, but probably not a series that Gene Roddenberry would have entirely approved of.  Instead of a happy-go-lucky crew piloting the latest and greatest in Starfleet technology, we have a bunch of different species and races all living on a rather beat up old space station where not everything can be counted on to work properly.  We're not bolding going where no man has gone before, but it's definitely a step in a direction that Star Trek itself had feared to tread.<br />The first season of Deep Space Nine set up the series adequately.  The space station didn't warp around the galaxy, so, unlike other Treks, this series had more of an opportunity to build up a local universe, populated by cultures and characters.  A lot of this season is simply setting the stage for potential future stories.  For example, there's gobs of detail concerning Bajoran and Cardassian politics, some of which is shockingly interesting, while some of it just falls flat and is promptly ignored.<br />Setting up the characters is also something that the creators needed to do fairly early on, and this they do an excellent job at.  From the very beginning, we know who they are; the actors put their stamps on immediately.  But as the season progresses we also see how they interact with each other.  Odo and O'Brien immediately come alive, both based on great performances from good character actors.  I've also come to appreciate Avery Brooks' acting in the part of Captain Sisko.  I was cold to his performances when I watched Deep Space Nine to begin with, but rewatching the series on DVD has given me a chance to reevaluate him, and I must admit to being impressed.<br />It's fun to go back to the beginning of the series and see how it was before the Powers That Be figured out exactly what they were doing.  Especially amusing is to note how nearly every early episode seemed to have a scene where the camera would focus upon an obviously out of place prop, which would promptlymorph into the familiar form of the shape-shifter, Odo, just to keep reminding the audience that, hey, this guy can change his appearance.  Also entertaining is seeing how early the producers got on board the idea of having the Morn character as a constant running gag.  Fortunately, he's hysterical.<br />The DVD extras are fairly decent.  There are lots of interviews with the cast members and production people.  The documentaries are tied to the first season, therefore we have a look at how they designed the aliens from that season, how the series was pitched, how they designed the station, what the characters were designed to be, etc, etc.  Also included are several &quot;hidden&quot; interviews, though the user would have to navigating the extras menus with his/her eyes closed not to notice them.  These extras and documentaries are rather interesting for a casual fan like myself, though I suspect that more hardcore members of Star Trek fandom will already know most of the information revealed here.  Still, it's nice to get a peek behind the scenes and to see the actors appearing as themselves.  Who would have imagined that Armin Shimerman, the man behind the comedy Quark character, was such a serious actor?<br />There are some really good stories here, but also some bad ones to balance things out.  It's difficult to rate an entire season's worth of episodes in a short space, but, to be perfectly honest, I rate this one as &quot;average&quot;.  Don't get me wrong; there's some good stuff here.  But there are also some missteps, mistakes and fumbles.  Modern Star Trek series seem to require a little bit of time before they settle in (and some of them simply never really take off, no matter how long they're kept on the boil), and Deep Space Nine is no exception.  The best was yet to come.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Belle is bored with life in her village.  Her only escape is her books, and she longs to have an adventure of her own.  When her father heads out to a fair, he gets lots, and Belle finds him in an enchanted castle.  The objects are thrilled, because if she and their master, the Beast, fall in love, they will all be freed from the enchantment.  But will Belle be able to see past the outward appearance?  And what about the handsome bore back home who wants to marry Belle?<br /><br />I feel in love with this movie the first time I saw it, and that love has only grown over the years.  The story is the right mix of fun and uncertainty.  Gaston was a wonderful addition to the mix because his story was the part I was most uncertain about the first time around.  The artwork on the film catches your eye from the first shot of the castle, and doesn't let go.  Beside the incredible background shots are wonderful drawings of the characters.  I especially love the boyish excitement they manage to give the Beast in several scenes.  Finally, there's the music.  Every song adds to the story and is memorable in its own right.<br /><br />This DVD is perfect for any fan of this movie.  Disc 1 includes three versions of the film.  The first is the \\"in progress\\" version shown to the New York film festival 6 weeks before the premier of the movie in 1991.  While it's fun to have, I won't be watching it regularly.  The second version is the original release.  And finally comes the special edition, with the added scene and \\"Human Again.\\"  Ironically, this is probably my least favorite of the songs added to the Broadway version, but it does advance the story.  And, there's always the option of watching the original version.  Obviously, the version that you are supposed to watch is the special edition, as the audio commentary and sing along bonus features only work with this option.  All three come in Dolby 5.1 sound, which sounds great.<br /><br />The second disc features hours of bonus material.  Most of it focuses on the making of this movie.  Everything is covered, from original idea through characters and the Broadway version and special edition.  Galleries show character designs over the course of the project.  Also featured is the original treatments for \\"Human Again\\" and \\"Be Our Guest.\\"  Celebrity voices give background on the original story and Disney versions of classic tales.  And there's a fun documentary as the stars of \\"Even Stevens\\" take a backstage look at all the work that goes into making a feature animated film.<br /><br />This is the first annimated film to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture.

B00002E233|5.0|Simply put, deep blue sea is the best shark film in my opinion that I have ever seen, it is even better than Jaws. Great special<BR>effects, shocks and good acting.
0375823360|2.0|The Golden Compass was absolutely scintillating.  The guy's a great writer.  However, in the Amber Spyglass, the truth comes out.  Yahweh (Jehovah, God Almighty), is just one of a pantheon of sencient dark materials in a strictly material creation.<br />I love Sci-Fi and Fantasy.  But not one that assaults my Christianity.  The comparisons to Tolkien and Lewis are not deserved.<br />This is a childrens series?<br />If I were an athiest, I'd undoubtedly love this series.  However, I'm not, and the unfinished trilogy went out in today's garbage.
6305003882|5.0|Most of these people on here that wrote reviews have no idea what they are talking about.This movie was great and anybody that has been in the place of Leo's chatacter knows how well this movie was made.Anybody that has never done the things that go on in this movie might not understand the way drugs take over your life.All the characters play good parts but Leo's acting when he is kicking heroin is the best i have seen yet and the most accurate.I give this movie two thumbs up and highly recommend buying it.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I can understand why some of the other reviewers haven't liked this album much; it's a dynamic narrative story that's almost cryptic without the proper context.  I was lucky enough to see Neil and Crazy Horse this summer on the pre-Greendale tour -- for those who haven't heard about it, I'll briefly describe.  Neil and the band put together a rather post-mod stage show replete with actors, sets, background slide displays and (naturally) the band ripping out some fantastic live versions of the songs in sequence.  It wasn't too dissimilar to the total impact of the Rust tour, without the greatest-hits package, of course.  With all of the multi-media supporting Neil's musical narration of the Green family, the story was comprehensible, and to me, very moving.<br />Without that previous experience, this album might have sounded like so much grungy sludge when I bought it.<br />Luckily for the new exposee, Neil has thoughtfully provided a live DVD (accoustic, so it's not too much Horse overkill) that fleshes out the storyline.  Buy this CD, but watch the DVD first.  With that concert under your belt, the true power of these songs rise to the surface.<br />Regarding the story and music... some comparisons to Our Town are apt -- put that great play through a blender with Neil's earlier multi-generational and drug-related works (think Harvest &amp; Tonight's the Night) and you get a good idea of what he's trying to do.  The tunes are vintage Horse -- more Zuma and Broken Arrow than Ragged Glory.  The melancholy that permeates the middle half of this record seems indicative of Neil's view on society as a whole: he doesn't get it, he doesn't particularly like it, and it makes him sad.<br />Lucky for us: a sad, cranky Neil Young makes some beautiful and thought-provoking music.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|His recent tour Young played all his new 'Greendale'songs.The audience was suprised in a positive way.The album out now, Young plays with Crazy Horse (without Sampedro)and will suprise his fans again. He sings and plays inspired and it has a relaxed spirit.<br />The album is about the Green family living in the fictional town Greendale. The songs are linked to eachother and is like a comedy book. Young shows on &quot;Double E&quot; his R&amp;B influence which he had earlier in his career. That's perhaps the best conclusion of this album: Young puts all his influences in this album. The DVD which matches the album is realy outstanding and joyfull. Thanks to Greendale Neil Young is back where he belongs: at the top.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|What can I say - I love the movie and I love the music. I can listen to it over and over reliving moments from the movie. The only drawback being that there isn't more music, after a few minutes of listening I was sad to see I was already halfway through the CD. The music is almost as much fun as the movie!
B000002UA9|4.0|The Beatles, as everyone knows, evolved greatly during their run.  Their reasons for playing changed as well.  As a club band, they were mainly interested in making people get up and dance, so their music had to be highly exciting and almost electrically charged.  Later, when their live-playing days were over, they were more interested in making different kinds of music that wouldn't carry over easily to live performances.  So here we are with their first album, and it is coming from the Beatles as they were when they were a club band.  When you realize that the stuff on this album was recorded as it was played, with no studio trickery, you realize two things: 1) that the Beatles were really good musicians, and 2)just how much sheer fun a live Beatles show must have been in those early days.  These guys were obviously very, very good at what they did, which was get a club full of semi-drunk people excited over their music.  Alright, it isn't as artful as their later stuff, but you can't compare the two extremes.  This album, this music, stands on its own.  The word \\"fun\\" is used often in the reviews of this CD, and that is a great word for it.  Buy this one, put it in the stereo, crank it up, and get ready for some real fun made by a band that knew how to rock the room!
B00005OM4K|5.0|I compared many of the later songs to the original vinyls I own.  Remastered or not, the vinyl LP's are better.  The old vinyl sounded warm and smooth compared to the harsher remastered cd's. But this box does afford the opportunity to experience the band's musical development.  There are many studio tracks never before released. But for those of us who were there, it is absurd to attempt to separate the Fogerty brothers and this body of work from the &quot;1960's Haight-Asbury drug-fueled self-indulgent morass of most bands from San Francisco&quot; as one reviewer did.  With the exception of a stint in the Army all of the band members were inextricably involved and influenced (musically socially and politically) by San Francisco's 1967-1969 Haight music community.  CCR often played S.F. Filmore West and appeared in all of the Berkeley psychedelic hippy clubs.  This Box set takes you a long way.  It's all here, their Berkeley/El Cerito early rock and roll style to their late 1960's anti Viet Nam War messages to plain Mississippi Delta fun rockabilly r&amp;b.
B00009V7P8|5.0|\\"You give me miles and miles of mountains/and I'll still ask for the sea\\" these words from  the song \\"Volcano\\" on Damien Rice's new album \\"O\\" represent the lyric power that Rice has. In an impressive debut album, Rice has been credited with practically re-inventing the folk genre. Imagine sitting in a recording studio, watching a guy in a dirty button up shirt, not clean shaven, privately strumming his guitar and quietly singing to himself. If you can see that, than you have the tone of this album. The lyrics speak to anyone, when you sing about heartbreak and lost love, anyone can identify. That may be the only weakness of this album, and it's barely even a weakness because the songs are so beautiful, they are so personal and so scathing at times, Rice lets his heart hang on his sleeve for everyone to hear. The reason this album is so different from other \\"folk\\" albums, involve two simple additions. A cellist, and a female vocalist whose voice is beautiful by itself, but together compliments Rice's soft tenor perfectly. The album in a whole flows seamlessly, with lush orchestrations complimenting the simple guitar melodies on the song \\"Amie\\" and the soft spoken beauty of \\"Cannonball\\". Lisa Hannigans vocals add a quality to the songs that is gorgeous when their voices intertwine together on \\"Volcano\\", the first single off of the new album. The Irish born Rice is just starting to make a splash state-side. His album `O' has been out for over a year in his native Ireland, but was just released in June here in the US. If you are lucky enough to be flipping through your cable some night and stop at VH1, watch for Rice's video for \\"Volcano\\", as he is one of the stations \\"Inside Track Artists\\" As an emerging artist, Rice certainly has the power to capture and create a following from listeners all over the world. The album is available at Wal-mart, and online. If you want more information on Damien Rice
B00004XQP4|4.0|I just got this recently, cause I haven't heard it yet and I was to curious to hear it after not buying a Green Day cd for a few years.  If you're expecting &quot;Dookie&quot; you'll not gonna get it in this album.  This is a mature record(even more then nimrod) and doesn't use the fast brand of pop/punk that Green Day kind of created in the Lookout days, this may turn down some old fans.  They kind of experiment with new instruments like the Mandolin, Harmonica, Farfisa, and Accordion I think that's really cool.  The song &quot;Misery&quot; can bea bitter pill for old fans, cause the heavy experimenting on this song, but to me it's interesting.<BR>Other good songs are &quot;Church on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Deadbeat Holiday&quot;, the single &quot;Minority&quot;, and the great closer &quot;Macy Day Parade&quot;.  All in all a good disc, but gets kind of boring I guess.A must for almost any Green Day fan, except if you're only into pop/punk and can't the take a new different Green Day.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This album sounds like a slightly more guitar based version of Amnesiac. By overall mood and sound the band's description as &quot;OK computer II&quot; is not too far off - (HTTT is a bit more depressing even). However it's songs lack the elemental quality that make the songs on OK, the Bends and Kid A so fantastic.<br />Overall a good album with all the rich texture and complexity we expect from Radiohead, but a bit less inspired than previous releases.
B00004Z459|1.0|Well, I noticed there isn't actually a bad review of this 'album' which is silly because the fact is, that along with Harry Potter and other such things, it is only the hype which the record company shovels out that makes it so successful, and of course, the need to be as cool as the next guy. BUT I am not gonna be biased because I hate pop music (don't call it nu metal because technically it isn't nu or metal, the term Pop music is derived from popular music, which you will all agree, Linkin Park is very popular)<BR>I have actually listened to this album, twice, I have even tried to like it but I cannot get over the fact that not only is it so easy to knock out an album of this lack of skill I could name a-grillion bands that could be as bad as Linkin Park if they didn't try to make albums with a little bit of substance to them but it truly is bonkers how everyone says how talented they are when they are not actually writing the songs, sure they come up with a basic song but by the time the producer has finished with it, it is NOTHING like how it started out, nor is there any leeway in it's growth from there on. The song means nothing but $$<BR>I laugh in the face of people telling me that metal is talentless, and \\"it's only screamin' and bashin your instruments isn't it?!?\\" that's rubbish, if you listen to a song by a bands like Cryptopsy, Orign, Nevermore or Iced Earth (which I don't recommend you start with, you would actually pass out, the first two especially, im warning you! hehe)<BR>But im not here to tell you not to listen to this album if you TRULY like it ... that's the wonderful thing about music, NO ONE should be able to tell you that you can't like this or that because you just can't ... it's up to you, that's why I don't like this album, personally the songs mean nothing and they don't try  hide that. All Im saying is check out every other alternative before buying this album and become your own person...
B000003S0P|3.0|This is propably the most &quot;skinny&quot; hardcore album that a progressive psy band can relase...robert fripp is a genious but the rest of the group seems to thinking at their future plans...<BR>I love it...
B00008PC2O|4.0|Picture quality: excellent.  Sound: Perfect.  Metal dvd case: not the best idea in the world.  As soon as you tear open the plastic you're confronted with a metal case that's as tough as the terminator on the cover!  This thing doesn't budge an inch.  They should have made it a tad bigger because it's not an easy task to get the real dvd case out of this thing.  It tore it to shreds people!!!  It ripped the plastic on the cover and scratched up the picture and the sides of the case..and this was the first time i opened it!!!  It really is that hard to get to so BE CAREFUL!!!  Now on to the dvd itself.  On disc one you have the extended version of the movie with over 16 minutes of additional footage added and also some behind the scenes stuff and commentary by James Cameron!  Disc two is a little shallow if you don't have a DVD rom for your pc. You get 2 documentaries, one that's like 20 minutes long and the other that's around 8.  They're both good behind the scenes stuff but nothing spectacular.  The rest of the contents like the Windows Media player version of T2 must be accesed from your computer.  No trailers, tv spots, or even pictures.  Overall, good buy but trust me, be careful opening it!!!
0385504209|5.0|On the first page of The DaVinci Code, the seventy-six-year-old curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere, staggers into the museum's Grand Gallery, tears a Caravaggio off the wall, and collapses backward onto the room's intricate parquet floor. At once an alarm sounds, triggered by the painting's removal, and an iron gate falls shut, sealing the Gallery off from the rest of the museum and separating Sauniere from his attacker.<br />In the brief interval between his deliberate self-imprisonment and his death, Sauniere constructs an elaborate cipher and, ingeniously, handpicks the individuals who will undertake its solution. French cryptologist Sophie Neveu and Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor and symbologist, must unravel the riddle of the curator's dying message. The path Sauniere sets the two on leads to a series of equally ingenious puzzles and involves them in a historical conspiracy. Wanted by the police, Neveu and Langdon are also shadowed by Sauniere's killer and by the elusive figure who directs him.<br />As the above summary may suggest, the plot of The DaVinci Code is a complex one, and Brown must impart a great deal of detailed, near scholarly information to readers to make his story comprehensible. But to the author's great credit, the requisite information--about Leonardo DaVinci, or the Knights Templar, or the devout Catholic sect Opus Dei--is delivered at precisely the right moments in the story, and in the right doses, so that the reader is never overwhelmed by it. The plotting of the book, too, is masterful: Brown doles out his revelations so the reader is left wanting more after every bite-sized chapter. The book's characters, particularly the renaissance man Sauniere, are intriguing and likeable. In short, The DaVinci Code is a perfect, riveting novel that will grab you in its first paragraph and keep you reading late into the night.
B000089RVX|1.0|This CD is the most unimaginative thing I've heard in a long time. I couldn't wait to turn it off. Hopefully, I can sell it used and get some money back.
B00005RERU|3.0|Decent westerns are hard to find, this 1961 film stands out with Brando. It is a recognizable Peckinpah screenplay. Though not as violent or refined you will notice the pre-Wild Bunch appearance of the cowboys and their low key, down and dirty personalities. In 61 westerns had just begun being less moralistic. Brando plays the badass good guy Rio. And to show he's a badboy he impregnates his rival's stepdaughter.<br />Stanley Kubrick quit as director and I suppose Brando did the best he could. The movie lacks some intensity, but sporadically shows flare; overall it is a good decent western. You have to see it if like Brando and Peckinpah!
B000002UAR|5.0|I must say that this is the best beatles album in my opinion. I am younger than most beatles fans as I am only sixteen but I think i know a good enough about them to create a good review. I have a little philosophy about music which is to not pay attention to who wrote what although i know who wrote each song. I focus more on each band member's muscial ability in each song. The best song on here in my opinion is Tomorrow Never Knows, which is about eastern mysticism. I do not follow mysticism but it's still a great song. Another good song is Taxman, and since i have just started my first job i must say me and the taxman are getting more and more familiar. Over all the beatles' musical talents on this album are very good. Guitar licks, bass lines, drums, all exellent. I hope this review was helpful, i am not that experienced in writing but i hope it helps.
B00005JLTN|2.0|This movie is a perfect example of the product of the greed of movie producers. The plot is weak, the action scenes are forced into the movie, there is nothing new and even the acting is mediocre. I consider the first movie to be the best action/sci-fi movie ever, but wouldn't even think of buying this one.
B000008GEF|4.0|I just bought this album and I must say, it's worth the money.  Although, I have worn out \\"All Things Must Pass\\", I thought I give this a try.  I like mostly every song on this album; I didn't care for the title track.  This album's kind of preachy, nothing wrong with that.  I only have two Harrison's albums; this one and \\"All Things Must Pass\\".  I like \\"ATMP\\" better than this one, maybe because I've listened to it so much I've adjust to it, I had to listen to this album a few times before adjusting to it.  One of my fav. songs is \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues.  I'm not putting this album down, I love George Harrison, and his music it's a great album.  Now my next Harrison album will be \\"Dark Horse\\".  This album is a must have for all George Harrison fans.
B000089RVX|4.0|Let me start off by saying that i never really was a fan of them until i bought this record.  I was amazed at the talent that this band provides.  With that said, let me review the album &quot;Fallen&quot;:<br />1. Going Under: Wow!, I love this song.  Amy, the lead singer, comes from the heart on all of the songs, and this is one of the best.  a great way too start the album. (5/5)<br />2. Bring Me To Life:  Good song.  ill admit, i didnt really like it when it came out, but i love the song now.  It was a perfect choice for the first single. (5/5)<br />3. Everybodys Fool: This is a cool song.  One i didnt expect to hear on the album.  It shows a more angry, to say the least, side  of Amy.  Good song, you should like it (4.5/5)<br />4. My Immortal: i like this song for a couple reasons.  it is a song that you would have never expected on this album.  It has no guitar, no drums, just piano, etc., and voice.  This and &quot;Hello&quot; are very similar, but you'll like this one better.  Great song, very deep (4/5)<br />5. Haunted: Alright song.  Its not a single, but you should like it.  It is a track that kind of blends in with the rest. (3.5/5)<br />6. Tourniquet: I liked this song the first couple times through, but now i dont listen to it anymore.  I just dont like it as much.  It is a good, dark song, and it is very emotional, but, it isnt my favorite.  But, i am rating these on their quality, so.....(4/5)<br />7. Imaginary: Cool song, also a blend in type song.  the lyrics are creative, and cool.  Not a really deep song.  Good though. (3.5/5)<br />8: Taking Over Me: I didnt like this song first time through.  Now, its one of my favorites.  Its a very interesting song for this album,  but it fits perfectly. (4/5)<br />9. Hello- Not a fan of this song.  Its good, but boring.  the lyrics are very deep, but the music is boring.  You may like it, but, it will get annoying after a while. (3/5)<br />10. My Last Breath: My favorite of the album.  i dont think it is a single, but, i love the song.  it mixes the right instraments in together, and it all just fits perfect. (4.5/5)<br />11. Whisper: Cool song, cool lyrics, the outro to the song goes on to long, but, its a cool song.  You shoulc enjoy it.  Also check out the lyrics:<br />&quot;fallen angels at my feet,<BR>whispered voices at my ear,<BR>death before my eyes.<BR>lying next to me i fear&quot;<br />Cool cong (4.5/5)<br />Overall: Reccomended
B000069HKH|5.0|We have every Bruce album from Asbury Park on, and &quot;The Rising&quot; seems to fill both a stirring epilog to 9/11, and shows another facet of his evolving musical tastes.  I find that the best way to listen is with a good personal CD player, earphones, and late at night, since I am disabled, and spend a large part of my nights either watching HBO, or listening to CD's . The amazing thing about &quot;The Rising&quot; is that it gets better each time you listen to it, especially at 3 AM, when I'm having trouble getting to sleep. I sustained paraplegia from a spinal infection on Sept. 11, 2001 (the timing seems to be a little too far out for me to comprehend), and I've been pretty stable since then, but with no sensation or muscle action below the level of spinal segment T-6. I was a physician to that point, and still have a valid medical license in NC, but my medical practice is pretty well limited to medical advice, particularly to friends and family.  So Bruce and I have gone our separate ways, and at age 73, I can still name all the members of the E-street band, and I can astound our 6 grandchildren by relating my experiences at the five or six Bruce concerts that he gave in NC - it shakes up the grandkids when their old fart of a grandfather throws those little tidbits to them - it keeps them on their toes.
0790729725|3.0|Note to Warner Brothers:  Your DVD production team should be fired! Great film- but I hate the Double Sided DVD!  Also, where are the extras?  You know- behind the scenes, deleted scenes, director's commentary?  The extras you'd expect from a DVD.  None of WB's DVD's have these.  EG: The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Stanley Kubrick Collection (I would have loved to see the making of 2001: A Space Odyssey).  Also, what's up with the cardboard DVD cases?  Anyway, Goodfellas is good, but WB's DVD production team needs to be totally gutted.
055357342X|5.0|George R. R. Martin continues to treat the reader with fascinating characters, political intrigue and a shocking death or two.  I won't go into detail about the plot and characters of this book but instead I'll focus on why Martin is the greatest fantasy author of our time.<br />As many have already noted, Martin doesn't follow typical epic fantasy conventions.  Instead, Martin gives us a fantasy setting very much based on medieval Britain--a medieval Britain where magic is scarce and the jostling and scheming among the great houses of Westeros is the rule.<br />Martin is unpredictable and it is difficult to guess where he's going with the story.  He doesn't pull plot twists out of his hat, though, as a second reading of any of his &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels will reveal the groundwork laid down by Martin that led up to the surprising plot turns (the second time I read the novels I kept hitting my head every time I came upon a clue that led to one of the big surprises).<br />Another quality Martin has is his ability to paint realistic characters: Not every good guy is that good nor is every bad guy all bad.  In fact, some guys who you thought were good end up making some terrible choices--either out of greed, love or pride--that cost them honor, family and even their very lives.  And some of the most unredeemable bad guys in the novel slowly change to become better, if not good, as they mature and try to shed their evil ways (not always sucessfully).  The depth of characterization in A Storm of Swords is astounding as characters slowly grow--sometimes for the better, often for the worse.<br />Martin doesn't let his love for his characters interfere with the gritty realism of A Storm of Swords.  Some of the most interesting characters--hated and beloved--in the series die here.  A few readers have complained about this but to me it is a refreshing change of pace from other epic fantasy novels where the good guys never die and always overcome the bad guys in the end.  That's not the way it works in A Storm of Swords.<br />A Storm of Swords is broken up into ten different characters' points of view (each chapter is titled with the names of one of those ten characters--some of the ten get more chapters than others do).  Often we get to read about the same events twice only told from two (or more) differing perspectives.  But don't think that because a character has his own chapters/point of view that he's immune from Martin's axe.<br />A Storm of Swords is a realistic, gritty, epic fantasy novel inspired by historical events in medieval Britain.  A must read.
B00003CXAA|3.0|This is one of my favorite film series of all time.  I &amp; II were great films, as everyone else has stated.  My only complaint, and this is a BIG one- Why weren't the DVD's digitally remastered?  The quality is horrible on these DVD's.  You can see the film scratches on the DVD.  It looks like I'm actually watching the original VHS tape from 1972.  Hopefully, another version is the works, to give these films the quality they deserve.

B000002UCQ|5.0|Being a Beatles fan, I remember when this album was poised for release.  Given the fact that (in vinyl) it was a triple album, the critics Beatles fans went crazy with all sorts of pre-release conjecture that the album would be a sorry collection of forgettable songs with one or two hits included to pull album sales.<br />I remember when the album hit.  Despite all of the negative hype I eagerly went and bought my copy.<br />What emerged were many of the greatest and most memorable songs of all times.  Songs like My Sweet Lord, Isn't It a Pity, Wah-Wah, What is Life, Awaiting On You All and, of course the title cut, All Things Must Pass.  <br />I literally wore that album out with incessant playing and rejoiced when CD technology made it available all over again.<br />Yes, some things must pass and fortunately--when it comes to some music--the faster the better.  But here's hoping that this one sticks around for years and years to come.  I've introduced it to my teenagers who have enthusiastically embraced it.  Next, my grandchildren (when they arrive, of course).
B00006BNDI|1.0|Count Grishnak, aka Varg Vikernes should never get credit for any of this music solely for the reason that he murdered the originator of black metal, Euronymous from Mayhem.  The music is not too bad, but Grishnak deserves no attention for his deeds.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|When I first saw this musical in my 10th grade english class as part of our american film unit, I was somewhat reluctant towards liking this movie. We ended up watching it again and evaluating it closer in order to really hit on the topics in the movie. After seeing it for the second time the movie started to stick with me. The continuous replay of the movie in my mind forced me to buy the DVD. While I watched it again I realized what a great piece of art this is. The movie shows one of the most troubled times in the world, and teaches us how to better ourselves from such a tradjedy. Each musical number is perfectly placed in order to build character developement and move the plot along. There are so many non-narritive elements in the movie that create a clear viewing of the true characters. This is truly a great american classic. You gain so much more out of watching this video than just a 2 hour enjoyment spree. Every part of the movie is perfectly crafted in order to develope the stories morals. I cannot speak enough about this movie. I believe everyone should see this movie.
B000002BDB|5.0|...THESE CATS MILES AND GIL WERE TERRIFIC TOGETHER! I CAN LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM A 1000 TIMES MORE THAN I PLAYED IT!

B00008EY9G|2.0|I *COULD* go on about how this movie annoyed me. I *COULD* complain how increasingly fed up I was with being so far ahead of this movie, that it almost never caught up. I could talk about how Pruitt Taylor Vince looks so much like former MTV host Matt Pinfield, I was nearly doubled over with laughter whenever he was in the picture. And oh, how I *COULD* go on about what has to be THE most convoluted plot outside of Donald Kaufman's &quot;The 3&quot; from &quot;Adaptation&quot; (Seriously. That's all I kept thinking about watching it). But I WILL ask- where is the &quot;alternate ending&quot; advertised on the disc supplementals? I watched the extended version all the way through, then cut back to the theatrical cut to see the difference about 10 minutes from the end, but they were EXACTLY the same! I watched all the deleted scenes, but they were just extended scenes from the movie, nothing effecting the outcome. I guess part of me wants to believe that somewhere, somehow there's another part of the movie that would let me forgive all the things that drove me nuts about wasting my time with this movie. But it's just not meant to be. Oh yeah, and John Cusack is the only guy actually acting not just performing here(Or gads-mouthing all her lines at top volume like Clea Duvall), but I still say it's only barely worth a rent if you're easily surprised or thrilled. PU!
B000099T2L|3.0|Ive always been a Destinys Child fan, and Ive been looking foward Beyonces solo debut for so long. I can say that this album is better than I thought, at first I was expecting more Independent Woman, Bootylicious, Survivor type of songs with great vocals but whack lyrics. But Dangerously in Love is not this type of album. Beyonces grown up and her songwritting skills have improved. She shows her talent in songs like \\"Be With You\\" (nice vocals & catchy hook for a slow song), \\"Yes\\" (one of my favorite songs in the album, talks about how a guy dont wanna wait to take the next step and is tryin to rush her), Speechless\\" (beautiful ballad about making love), \\"Me, Myself and I\\", \\"Crazy in Love\\" (yall already listened to that one in the radio) and \\"The Closer I get to You\\" (duet with Luther Vandross).<BR>The reason why I dont give 5 stars to the album is because after all this waiting, (shes been working on this album over a year) it seems like this album was done in a hurry. I expected so much more of songs like \\"Baby Boy\\" feat. Sean Paul, it seems like it was done in one day to finish the album quickly, the same happens with \\"Thats how you like it\\" and \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" this two songs shouldnt be in the album. <BR>I still like this album is better and more mature that I thought but its weak at some points.
B00005JKG5|4.0|When this came out it was really a visual triumph.  It was directed a la MTV by Adrian Lyne.  When seeing *behind the scenes* type shows about this movie it was clear that this was a difficult project to get finished...with much contoversy.<br />Visually, it was quite different.  The sets are gritty and smokey (too smokey for many execs).  The style is quick and the focus is on the music and the danicing and to a lesser extent the love story between the two very appealing stars (jennifer beals and michael noiri)<br />By day jennifer beals works as a welder and by night she works as a dancer in a seedy club doing amazing dance routines (okay, Marine Jansen does the dance routines).  Her dream is to go to a snooty dance school even tho she has no formal training.  The love story is between her and her boss at the welding job, who is also on the board at the dance conservatory.<br />The movie launced the ripped sweat shirt style.  Debatable as to whether that worked outside the movie...but it did work inside the move.<br />This is really a very good escape.  Its fast paced and fun. The dancing is amazing and you will be hard pressed to tell what is actually Jennifer doing the danicing and what is Ms.  Jansen (In the final scene, which was actually re-written to make it more exciting...  there are actually 3 dancers...Ms Beals, Ms Jansen and a young man who does break dancing.  Its quite an amazing feat of editing.  Its seamless)  What it lacks in writing,  and it is lacking there, it makes up in energy and visual appeal.  If you haven't seen it, make a point to see it at least once.  If you have seen it...rip and sweat shirt, make some pop corn and see it again...
0066214122|3.0|Four nanostars which means three normal stars, at the beginning the book will keep you interested, but as you are reading it gets slower and slower, and as all of Crichton's books the end is to long, it could be shorter and a little bit better, another thing is that all the book could be real, but the end is just a fantasy, he could think better on how to end this book. Nevertheless Crichton is a very good writer but is very difficult to write always very good books.
B00009P1O0|5.0|When Neil Young's label rejected the bleak, hopeless Tonight's The Night as unreleasable, Young gave them this bouquet of roses and bright sunshine instead. Though certainly not as hopelessly dark and dour as that album, On The Beach is no record of bliss. It is similarly harrowing, featuring some particularly biting and incisive lyrics, though not without some musical beauty. The opening track, Walk On, is one of those short, effective rockers that Neil Young sometimes likes to start his albums out with -- think in terms of Don't Cry No Tears -- that is very different from anything else on the album. Its rollicking, quasi-reggae musical backing gets the album off to a springy start -- even answering back Lynyrd Skynyrd with the very first line of the album... or is he talking about his critics? -- and it deserved to be a hit single. No doubt it would have been, if both the public and the record company weren't crying for Harvest Redux. See The Sky About To Rain is a beautiful track featuring Young's Wurlitzer Piano that also boasts a touching, heart-felt lyric. Revolution Blues is positively disturbing. The album's lone Crazy Horse-esque rocker, the Charles Manson-inspired lyric is powerful enough to make one feel positively uncomfortable. Musically, this is a quite varied and diverse album, as the next track, For The Turnstiles proves:  it features only Young on banjo and an accompanying dobro; the lyric is extremely enigmatic. Despite the titles, Vampire Blues is the album's only actual blues song -- and a fine one it is, with Young commenting darkly but not withour humor on foreign oil; this is a song that is clearly applicable today. The semi-hallucinatory title track shows Young's dissatisfaction with rock star fame. Motion Pictures is an affecting and somewhat ambiguous track addressed to his then-wife. The epic Ambulance Blues closes out the album, and what a song it is. This great song reads something like a series of long, rambling journal entries, in which we find Young commenting on everything from the decay of the 60's counterculture to nostalgia to Nixon to his own then-current state of mind. This remarkable piece finds Young using the medium of music almost as a way to exorcise his own haunting personal demons, as he had done on Tonight's The Night:  \\"I guess I'll call it sickness gone/It's hard to say the meaning of this song/An ambulance can only go so fast/It's easy to get buried in the past/When you try to make a good thing last.\\" A truly remarkable close to a remarkable album. This album features consistently strong writing, appropriate musical backing, and a fairly wide variety of songs; it is a true classic. Finally released on CD, after a seemingly endless wait, many long-time Young fans are now able to hear this long-lost gem for the first time. Don't miss your chance.
0767830555|5.0|Director Martin Scorcese and Robert De Niro (as Travis Bickle) collaborated on a film unlike almost any other I have seen. What to say about it? Bickle is a delusional and dysfunctional (probably deranged) taxi driver in Manhattan who is strongly attracted to Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful young woman centrally involved in the political campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris); Bickle also attempts to befriend Iris (Jodie Foster), a runaway teenage prostitute. He proclaims \\"I'm God's lonely man!\\" In some respects resembling the psychotic character Archer Maggott played by Telly Savalas in The Dirty Dozen, Bickle also sees himself as God's avenging angel whose mission in life is to eliminate all of the evil which he perceives in his world. After recently seeing this film again, I asked myself the same question I did in 1976: How many Travis Bickles are out there? All of the performances are outstanding. Working carefully with Paul Schrader's screenplay on which he presumably collaborated, Scorcese portrays a sordid, potentially violent underworld which is most dangerous after all the \\"good people\\" are comfortably settled and secure in their homes. Laurent Bouzereau's 70-minute \\"making of\\" feature provided with the Collector's Edition is highly informative, as are the mini-biographies of Scorcese, De Niro, Keitel, Foster, and Shepherd.
B00000DCHE|5.0|Not much to add to the many positive reviews.  Nonetheless, you cannot listen to the opening track, Miami 2017, the same way you did a couple of years ago, pre-9/11.  It had always been a powerful song, but these days the experience of listening to the lyrics and the crowd reactions to them is strangely cathartic. The rest of the CD has no duds, either.
B00005MP58|4.0|I found this version of Pride and Prejudice infinitely better than those I have seen in the past.  I read the book after I watched the movie and was glad I did.  The only thing I would criticize is the development of the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth.  It was slow and lagged behind the details in the book.  I was not sure of their feelings for each other throughout and because of that the ending was a complete surprise.  It felt as if it was cliffhanger; I was left completely unsatisfied by the ending.  At the last scene I was still not sure what they felt for each other.  There are parts left out of the movie that were integral in the book.  Though I realize that every part of the book could not possibly find its way in this adaptation.  It is evident that much was left on the cutting room floor.  I agree with one of the reviewer that Jennifer Ehle's smirk in the movie was in the words of the characters at times tiresome.  I still would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of these types of stories and Jane Austen.
B000084T18|5.0|This brother is on fire.  He has done what he has to do. All he has to do for the rest of his life is chill.  All the songs are bumpin.  Many Men is the best song on the CD.  I listen to it everyday.  50 needs to put out more CDs after this one.  Keep dissing Ja Rule if you want to.

B00000255F|1.0|I have been amazed by Bruce Springsteen's popularity ever since I purchased this album amidst all of the hype that swirled around him.  Let's critique Bruce and the E. Street band:<br />Has anyone ever heard Steve Van Zandt's guitar?  I love him in the Soprano's and his cool radio gig, but he might as well not even plug in.  The whole band sounds like Meat Loaf - Bat Out Of Hell.  Overproduced, mini operas tied together by a piano.  The big man plays the same solo over and over.  Bruce's voice is not what I would call a pretty thing to listen to either.  Very limited vocal range.  He screams more than he sings.  I must be in the minority, but this sounds to me like corporate rock at its worst, heck, I would much rather listen to Southside Johnny or even Bon Jovi over this stuff.

I come from the psuedo-nerd class who prefers Next Generation to Original and also like watching Babylon 5 for the epic battle scenes.  What I liked about this series, besides its phenomonal writing and character development, is that it actually pays attention to the laws of physics.  One of the most ignored rules of space, long dismissed in television sci-fi, is that there is no sound in space!  None.  If the Death Star crashed into a Borg Cube which then set off the Superlaser which shot at Deep Space Nine causing it to actually move which caused it to bunp the Intrepid into the Executor and then all of these things simulteanously exploded, you wouldn't hear a thing.  Not one thing.  Firefly actually grasps  this concept which speaks volumes of its respect for what it is doing.  Its was a great series, which is obviously why it was cancelled after one short season.
0736041850|1.0|Great illustrations, but the book is full of innaccuracies, perpetuating many of the myths of strength training.<br />For example,there is an exercise showing how to work the &quot;inner pecs&quot; - something which is anatomically impossible, since you cannot contract only part of a muscle fiber.<br />Also, he writes how different hand rotations affect different heads of the triceps during various pushdowns - also anatomically impossible, since the triceps attaches to the ulna not to the radius and is thus unaffected by arm pronation/supination (rotation of the forearm).<br />These are only two of many inaccuracies!!<br />Nice drawings, not much else!
B000099T2L|5.0|Boyonce is one talented young lady, whether she is doing a solo album or one with the girls -- she has real talent. She can take anything and make it into something that you want to hear over and over again, and you find yourself falling in love with the lyrics because you can relate so much to what she is saying. Its like she has lived in your shoes and was a fly on the wall when you were going through a situation. A relationship is something that will always need to be openly discussed the way that she does. &quot;Yes&quot; is one of favorites, I could relate to that one the most. If Beyonce keeps singing, writing, and producing songs like she has now and in the past -- she will always be a living legend.
0375703861|4.0|Zadie Smith's White Teeth was a pleasure to read, yet the novel left something to be desired - especially the inadequate resolution. Smith's impeccable wit is apparent from the first page of the novel, transforming what would normally be a grim attempted suicide into a comical, ill-fated endeavor. It is in such a manner that Smith brings up numerous thought provoking issues ranging from race, to war, to religion, her clever style making such topics seem so extraneous to real life while at the same time subtly disclosing the fact that understanding them and coping with them is essential.<br />Smith's character development is superb, intertwining the tales of two very different families - the Jones and the Iqbals - and delving into the diverse histories of each character: Archie's failed marriage and attempted suicide, Samad's inability to find satisfaction in his wife, and the two fathers' wartime partnership, due to convenience rather than chemistry. Then there's Clara's rejection of her mother's religion and way of life, and her short-lived fling with an otherwise unwanted schoolboy; Alsana's hatred of India; Magid, Millat, and Irie's linked fates; countless histories which all coincide brilliantly under Smith's writing. While there is certainly a wealth of well-rounded characters for Smith to play with, she spends too much time with flatter characters who clutter the story.<br />Smith waits until the middle of the novel to introduce the Chalfens, a family of characters who bear a great deal of importance to the text. However, their link to anything preceding their entrance is weak, and the change in focus is too abrupt, bringing the pace of the novel to a sudden halt. It takes Smith some time to rebuild confidence in the novel, at which point it picks back up. Unfortunately, the end of the book arrives very quickly at such an instance, and after Smith had put a lot of work into building suspense, the climax was painfully unsatisfying and left me unhappy.<br />Essentially, Smith's problem is her inconsistent writing quality. There is so much excellent writing to be found in this book, but Smith fails to maintain her exceptional prose evenly throughout. As a result, it was difficult to enjoy White Teeth as I would have liked. Smith pulls this off while moving the novel along at an extremely brisk pace - but this unfortunately works against her at some points. Taking the focus away from flatter characters coupled with a more satisfying resolution would have earned this book a higher score, but Smith's wit combined with the way in which she introduces and explores important issues makes White Teeth well worth reading.

B000067CPX|4.0|Long time fans of the Red Hot Chili Peppers might disagree, but once again the long surviving band has put out yet another more than solid album that has become a smash hit.  From the opening title track on, it is clear that this is a more subdued sound for the band, but we are left with a more melodic flow with RHCPs' trademark sound.  \\"Universally Speaking\\" is a standout track with Anthony Kiedis paying homage to his hometown, while the mournfully catchy \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is music to the ears to even casual fans of the band.  Other standout tracks include \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"I Could Die for You\\", \\"Throw Away Your Television\\", \\"On Mercury\\", and \\"Minor Thing\\"; but a few songs such as \\"Cabron\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song\\" tend to grate on the nerves.  All in all, \\"By the Way\\" is yet another solid album from one of the best and influential bands to ever grace the hard rock scene.
0783225733|5.0|Apollo 13, Ron Howard's 1995 recreation of the star-crossed April 1970 manned mission to the moon, is a riveting and stirring film about courage and ingenuity in the face of great peril.<br />Starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kathleen Quinlan, Xander Berkeley and Ed Harris, Apollo 13 begins with a flashback sequence set in January of 1967, when the three crew members of Apollo 1 died in a tragic launch pad accident.  As Walter Cronkite does a voiceover, there is a quick segue to Houston July 1969, where veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (Hanks) is throwing a moon-landing party to watch Neil Armstrong be the first man on the moon. (According to the director's commentary, this scene was written and shot to introduce the major characters of the drama and to give the viewer some idea of what life was like in the astronaut community during  NASA's Apollo heyday.)<br />After a tender moment with his wife Marilyn (Quinlan) and a scene at Cape Kennedy in which Lovell explains to a skeptical politician the necessity of continuing the manned moon landings at least up to Apollo 14 (a mission he is slated to command), fate intervenes.  Al Shepard, the commander of Apollo 13, is grounded when an ear infection flares up, and Lovell and his crew, lunar module pilot Fred Haise (Paxton) and command module pilot Ken Mattingly (Sinise) are moved \\"up the slot\\" to take over.<br />For Marilyn, the news is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, she's aware that this will be her husband's final mission in space, so she's proud and supportive.  On the other hand, she has a bad feeling about this flight, and her anxiety comes to the fore in this exchange:<br />MARILYN:  Thirteen.  Why does it have to be Thirteen?<br />LOVELL: Because it comes after Twelve, hon.<br />Lovell might have been nonchalant about the mission's \\"unlucky\\" number, but Apollo 13 was dogged by bad luck even before it lifted off the pad at 1313 hours on April 10, 1970.  A few days before liftoff, command module pilot Mattingly was grounded when another astronaut came down with the measles (he'd never been exposed, so ground controllers were afraid he'd get sick in space).  Lovell was forced to choose between flying with a replacement, Jack Swigert (Bacon) or holding out for Mattingly and being \\"bumped\\" off the flight altogether.<br />There were other little omens of ill luck involving Lovell's Corvette and Marilyn's wedding ring; critics later lambasted Howard for coming up with such \\"hokey\\" scenes, but according to Jim and Marilyn Lovell in their separate audio track, these events actually did occur.<br />Despite some minor errors in the details and a few things done intentionally for dramatic license, the depiction of an Apollo moon shot is about as accurate as a movie made for entertainment can be.  Hanks and Quinlan even stayed with the Lovell's to capture their characters' qualities and motivations.  Bacon and Paxton are wonderful as Lovell's two crewmates, and Ed Harris portrays Flight Director Gene Krantz as a logical and determined engineer/administrator.  Watching him go from grim realization that the mission has been jeopardized by an explosion (\\"We just lost the moon.\\") to firm decisiveness (\\"We've never lost an American in spaceflight and we sure aren't going to lose one on my watch.  Failure is not an option.), one sees that the moon landings depended as much on the ground controllers and engineers in Houston as they did on the astronauts in the spacecraft.<br />With a stirring score by James Horner and top notch special effects, Apollo 13 is one of director Howard's finest offerings.  It is fast paced, incredibly well-written and acted, and it is a fine tribute to the men and women who worked for a decade to get us to the moon and back.odule pilot Mattingly was grounded when another astronaut came down with the measles (he'd never been exposed, so ground controllers were afraid he'd get sick in space).

B0000AXE8I|4.0|Matrix Reloaded continued what the first movie gave its viewers, only kicked up a notch: more action and more philosophy, including the intriguing scene with the architect, which goes through all the foibles of humans and the importance of offering them the matrix, or the ability to reject for a so-called reality. The Oracle is developed more and becomes all the more intersting, as she is not the character we all thought we could trust. True, some of the action scenes are a bit long or even unnecessary but it does let the viewer see how far along Neo has come since we last saw him. Somehow, it's doubtful that those who didn't like it actually understood all that was revealed or else they would know that the Wachowski Brothers must have something extraordinary planned in November in order to get our heroes out of this one.
0316666343|3.0|When I started reading this book I couldn't put it down, what you would call a page turner. But by the last quarter of the book I became very disappointed. Maybe I missed something but I've talked to other people who have read this book and they say the same thing I do. Read it for yourself and see what you think, I wouldn't call it a waste of time. All in all I have to agree with the first review, doesn't quite deliver.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Let's get a  few things straight here.  First, the book that upon which this movie is based is a wonderful book, one of the best ever written, no doubt, and it has delighted millions of readers over the years.  Second, it is an extremely difficult book to turn into a movie.  Third, the movie will not follow the book exactly, which is too bad, but in some respects understandable.  <br />     However, while I enjoyed the movie and I understand that changes had to be made, I did not enjoy these particular changes themselves.  It seemed to me that the producers and directors of this film sold out the Tolkien ideal in order to dumb the movie down to the lowest common demoninator of movie goers.  This is what irked me the most.  I realize that it is impossible to include all the nuances of each character into a movie, although they did a great job with Gollum.  However, I have never liked the way they have turned Merry and Pippin into semi-coherent idiots and phasing out Eomer and over emphasising Aragorn really hurt the flow of the movie.  Let's face it, the whole Aragorn falling off the cliff scene and dreaming about Arwen was really boring and seemed totally out of place with the rest of the film.  The only reason it was in there was to \\"attract\\" female viewers.  In other words, it is just another example of putting a Hollywood Formula into the movie where it was neither needed nor wanted.  The overextended battle of Helm's Deep and the confusing and totally unnecessary portrayal of Faramir seriously dampened the effect of the movie as a whole and are just further examples of the Director inserting the Hollywood Formula to cater to the perceived needs of a dumb audience.  <br />    To summarize, while I understand the complexities of turning such a fantastic and intricate book into a movie, the changes that were made were unnecessary and detracted from the enjoyment of the movie as a whole. Overall, the movie is quite good.  As a comparison to the book, you'll be disappointed because it's obvious that those who are making these movies care only about tried and true Hollywood formulas and will use them at the expense of the far better written word.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is one of the best, and least understood, movies about drugs ever made.  It is not a cautionary tale about the evils of heroin and diet pill abuse.  It is about people who refuse to let go of their dreams, amd when those dreams fall the characters fall with them, hard.  It is about how American society and the media twist our desires to the point where we must become drug addicts and criminals to make our little lives seem meaningful.  It is about how we are then demonized and destroyed because we dare to dream.<BR>     this is not a movie for the faint of heart.  it contains some of the most shocking images i have ever seen on film.  not shocking in a Pink Flamingoes way but shocking because you care about the characters, and so the things that happen to them are that much more horrific.  Aronofsky is a visual stylist almost without equal, and no matter what you think of the film, you cannot help but be affected by its visual language, the world doesn't look quite the same when you're done watching it.  it is both a dream and a nightmare, and will affect the way you look at both.<BR>    of course, what brings it all home is the performances, especially Ellen Burstyn's, who deserves every award in existence.  in a movie like this it would have been easy for the actors to go over the top, but it is because they stayed grounded in real human desires that the film resonates as deeply as it does.  every member of the cast approaches their role with a heroic level of commitment and intensity.<BR>    anyone who cares about film should not miss Requiem for a Dream.  it shows us the best and worst of love, drugs, and the desire to live life passionately.  it does not ask that you feel sorry for its characters, only that you recognize that they are a part of you.  and it does it in a way that will continually shock and amaze you.

B00008G9JN|5.0|This is my all time favorite Tull album, combining the best of their folk music influences with their penchant for solid rock'n'roll. Being a fan of medievel music and Jethro Tull makes this a very strong offering in popular music. The combination of instruments and Ian Anderson's songwriting is so compelling. The mythological and legendary themes running through this recording are a treat for any serious student of Celtic inspired music. Take it, enjoy it and dance around the Maypole with it. This is a great album.
0452282152|5.0|I absolutly loved this book. I feel it depicted the life of Delft and the house of the beloved painter Vermeer. I had to read this book last year in 9th grade for honors English and I just fell in love with it. The characters are very well developed and you can feel the tention between Griet and Vermeer whenever they are together. Look for the movie soon!
B00008NRLX|5.0|Too often bands are condemned as mining the past, rehashing old ideas or being \\"retro\\".  Two thoughts present themselves. One, everyone who has commited the \\"sin\\" of picking up and playing a guitar since someone invented the damn thing is therefore \\"retro\\", and two, who is to say that new music is any better than old music?  Because Limp Bizkit invented Nu Metal, does that make them better than the Beatles? Of course not, and it is equally fallacious to condemn the Jayhawks for playing electrified folk rock.<br />The Jayhawks have been around now for around 18 years and churned out around 7 albums, and it seems they've now got to the point where they can't make a bad album.  God knows they tried, with the ashamedly populist feel of \\"Smile\\", and yet it sounded brilliant - no other band could've attempted such a transition and made it sound so good.  With this new album they decide to have a go at stripped down, almost folk-y rock music, and by god if they haven't gone and gotten that right too!<br />The Jayhawks haven't sounded this sparse before, and yet the spaces opened up in the mix allow the sounds to breathe more easily, the silences speaking louder than the words, and the heartstrings plucked even more tenderly by the ability for the listener to feel each knife to the heart.  The more one listens to the album, the more one is impressed by the richness and variety it contains.  While \\"Tailspin\\" and \\"Eyes of Sarahjane\\" rock out, \\"Tampa to Tulsa\\" and \\"Stumbling through the dark\\" curl up into a corner, pull a blanket over their heads and vow never to leave their bedroom again.<br />All the usual Jayhawks trademarks are here - chiming harmonies,  virtuouso multi-instrumentation, and effortlessly poetic lyrics.  Enough of a change in direction to keep the old fans interested, and enough radio-friendliness to win over the discerning listener.<br />In fact the crowning glory of this album might be to introduce a new generation of music-lover to the band's back catalogue, lending further credence to them being the most under-rated band in music today.  And perhaps through that, they can help save rock music, and therefore create a happier listening future for us all...ing further credence to them being the most under-rated band in music today.

B000001FFJ|5.0|without a doubt the best CD I have. it simply never gets old.  I could be listening to it for the 2nd or 22nd time in a row and I'm STILL humming the tunes.<BR>seriously, just go and buy this album. The price is worth for the 2 songs: Blind Love and Hang Down Your Head alone
B000000OQF|5.0|The age-old question for rock stars struggling with trying to hang onto their \\"cool\\", their \\"cred\\" and their \\"cojones\\" has always been, \\"Is it better to burn out or to fade away?\\".  At least now we know the answer.  If Guns and Roses had released this album and then perished in some unspeakably awful but glorious way (saving the world from drug addiction by consuming the world's entire supply of drugs for example) they would be universally acknowledged as the greatest band ever.  Yes we'd wail and gnash our teeth and cry, \\"But surely the rest of their career would have changed the face of music as we know it!!\\".  With hindsight we'd rather remember them as foul-mouthed hedonists at the height of their powers than as schizophrenic weirdos, still promising another album after a decade of silence.<br />Appetite for Destruction is the greatest rock record ever, and one of the greatest albums in the history of music.  No other band has managed to cut such a collection of visceral, spiteful, hateful and yet life-affirming tunes onto tape without self-destructing from the sheer energy driving the band.  This album is the sound of a band who know they've come from nothing and will return to nothing and only have one shot at the big time, and this is their shot - but by god do they know they deserve it and know they're going to make it.  While Axl screams and spits in your face, the band make a noise that sounds like society crumbling and a nation of parents turn away in horror.  Each song here is about either a drug, a girl, something that Axl doesn't like or , more commonly, a mixture of all three.  Axl has all the demons of past wrongs and paranoic fantasies breathing down his neck yet he never takes the easy step made by lesser talents (Korn, Limp, Papa Roach) of descending into self hate.  Instead he focusses his anger outward, taking swipes at the things he hates - like a lone wolf trapped in a corner he comes out fighting, and , reunited with his pack, leads them to victory.  At least I presume what that silly coda at the end of \\"Rocket Queen\\" is about; some sort of self congratulatory release from all the preceding tension.  It's the most incongruent thing on the album and sadly it points toward a future of pointless bickering and egotism which would ultimately tear the band apart.<br />But we're not here to talk about that, instead we're here to celebrate the finest record ever.  Everyone who grew up in the 80s and 90s (except those who grew up in Utah or Iran) gets a chill down their spine when they hear the opening note of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\".  The staccato guitar riff that teases you with the false opening then comes crashing back in with the siren.  The hairs on the back of your neck stand up, your pulse increases, your breathing becomes shallow and out atavistic fight of flight mechanism kicks in and says \\"Something's about to go down here...\\"  By the time Axl chimes in with his first \\"Huh!\\" of the album you've ahd to decide whether to stay and join the party, or run for the safety of your Duran Duran records...<br />Given that there isn't a single human being out there who hasn't heard this record (or at least there shouldn't be, and anyway, are they really likely to be reading this review?) I don't feel I need to describe the music much.  The first time you heard G'n'R is one of those things that everyone knows and everyone remembers, and it won't really come as a surprise to you to hear that there's a lot of swearing in bits, some of it is quite mysogenistic, and that \\"Mr Brownstone\\" is slang for heroin.<br />The question I'd like to pose is \\"Is it relevant today?\\".  The answer is a huge overwhelming \\"Yes!\\".  The album perhaps lost a little relevance during the internet boom of the nineties while wages were rising, crime was falling and most people were on balance pretty happy*  In 2003 though, unemployment and fear are the only things rising, and the people are increasingly unhappy - the smell of revolution is inthe air, and any good revolution needs a soundtrack.  G'n'R are as relevant now as they ever were.  Fed up with hypocracy?  Listen to \\"My Michelle\\". Nostalgic for the past? \\"Sweet child o' mine\\".  Want to pump yourself up before  tossing that trashcan through the window of Radioshack? \\"It's so easy\\" was made for moments like that.  The songs cover the gamut of human emotion, and only get richer with each listen.  17 years later, Axl still speaks directly to each one of us, our hopes our fears, our desires and our inner needs.  And we all have needs.<br />\\"Iusedtodoalittlebutalittlewouldn'tdoandsoalittlegotmoreandmore<br />Ijustkeeptryingtogetalittlebetterjustalittlebetterthanbefore...\\"<br />The poetry of Axl's lyrics has long been overlooked too.  He shares many characteristics with today's bad boy of the moment, Eminem, and both share an incredible lyrical prowess.  So they're also both violent, mysogenistic, homophobic, paranoid and fond of drugs - i guess it's no surprise that genius walks hand in hand with madness.  Perhaps Em can learn something from Axl.  At least Eminem has now put out 3 decent albums - perhaps he should call it quits and walk away while he's still on top of the game.<br />Guns and Roses, sadly, cannot turn back time and make the same decision, but perhaps we can forget the years that followed, drop onto the couch, crack open a bottle of jack, crank the stereo and  let Axl, Slash, Steve, Izzy and the other one (Matt?) remind you why it feels so damn good to be alive.

B00005B36H|5.0|I don't understand why there's such a huge argument over whether Lateralus is better or worse than Aenima. It's different of course, but if it was the same thing why would anyone bother buying what they already have?<BR>Opiate showed the emerging potential.<BR>Undertow was the diversity of style.<BR>Aenima was refinement of musical talent.<BR>Lateralus was refinement of the spiritual and intellectual.<br />Lateralus is hurt by the fact that it depends on listeners taking time to truly understand the lyrics, but if you pay attention and let it sink in, it will be very rewarding. All the angst and bravado and disorder that's typical of metal bands is stripped away, leaving only a powerful and unusually uplifting call to self-enlightenment. <br />If you liked the near-silent lyrics under \\"Third Eye\\", you'll love this album.
B0000028UK|5.0|After Ten was released and became successful, Eddie vedder and co. had a lot to live up to. Vs. is a very worthy follow-up to Ten and almost surpasses it. Just like Ten, every song on here is great, but the standout tracks here are &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Daughter&quot;, &quot;Glorified G&quot;, &quot;W.M.A.&quot;, &quot;RearViewMirror&quot;, &quot;Elderly Woman behind the counter...&quot; and &quot;Indifference&quot;. Dave Abbruzzese, their drummer at the time, is a worthy successor of Dave Krusen, though not as good and not as good as Matt Cameron, who would join later. I highly recommend this to anyone who loved Ten or is just getting into Pearl Jam.

Stroheim, Swanson, Holden and Billy Wilder have all acheived Immortality thru this film. There is also a very enlightening and entertaining history of this movie on the DVD. There is something about this movie that is unlike any other. I also reccomend the book by Sam Stagg

John Medeski's organ sounds are killer and Sco's guitar tone is one-of-a-kind, what a perfect match.

B000051YEG|5.0|Gainsbourg was an artist who experimented with all styles of music. Through his career, he put together a great number of fantastic singles. But this album is his great masterpiece. <br />There aren't any megahits. The most well known tracks: 'Ballade de Melody Nelson' and 'Ah, Melody' are first rate songs, but it's absolutely criminal to separate them from the rest of the album.<br />Clocking in at just under 30 minutes, &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot; flows as one poignant tale of Melody Nelson. The music itself was far ahead of it's time; listen to these songs and then listen to Air and Beck.  While the great orchestrations and melodies should be enough to sate the appetite of many non-francophone listeners, it is truly the lyrics that lift this album to timeless stature. Gainsborg was a poet to French song the way Dylan is to American song. This album is his finest hour, not to be missed by anyone interested in greatness in popular music.

Her portrayal of the main character was almost painful to witness.<br />I would never in my wildest dreams think of reccomending this movie to anyone I think of as a friend.  This movie is absolute FILTH.<br />It is not even worth one red cent.

B00008S2VG|5.0|I think I like &quot;American Life&quot; even more than her highly acclaimed &quot;Music&quot; (2000) or &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998). <BR>As Madonna evolves, her music gets better. Collaborating again with Mirwais Ahmadza, the techno-pop genius who co-produced &quot;Music,&quot; Madonna takes modern music into the future. <br />Some critics don't agree. They attack her personally rather than review her music. What did Madonna do to rock the boat this time? Make a controversial anti-war video and pull it at the last minute? Marry a Brit and abdicate by taking up part-time residence in London? Mature in a world where the media is obsessed with youth and thinks you're irrelevant if you're over 21? It's hard to say. <br />Caught up in the artifice of celebrity, people forget that Madonna is an artist. She uses pop music as a vehicle to produce art. Great art is timeless. It's not controlled by trends, fads or a &quot;Flavor of the Month&quot; mentality. <br />On a recent interview on &quot;Dateline,&quot; Matt Lauer asked Madonna why she's still famous after 20 years? Would he ask Frida Kahlo or Virginia Woolf such an absurd question if they were alive today? I don't think so. Maybe it's time for all of us to wise up and realize that artists like Madonna and Sheryl Crow have turned pop and rock music into a legitimate art form that allows the best artists in the field to keep creating. <br />Great art is introspective. The more personal it is the more universal it becomes. Madonna reveals more about herself in &quot;American Life&quot; than ever before. She exhibits a vulnerability throughout that's easy to relate to. She speaks to what it feels like to be a human being; to fall in love and lose your sense of identity in &quot;Static Process&quot;; to exist in a world of unanswered questions in &quot;Love Profusion&quot;; to want to be a star for all the wrong reasons in &quot;American Life&quot; and &quot;I'm So Stupid.&quot; Madonna may have lived, like most of us, in a &quot;fuzzy dream,&quot; but she's wiser now and has so much more to say. <br />&quot;Hollywood,&quot; is my favorite track. I love the word and the meaning it conjures up; so much so, it's been turning up in my poems since 1982. Madonna nails it when she says, &quot;How could it hurt you when it looks so good?&quot; &quot;Hollywood&quot; is a catchy number, a brilliant anthem, which paints a pretty picture. But the song features a dicho! tomy, a dark side, which creates tension making it a classic we'll never forget. <br />Madonna doesn't mince words. In &quot;Mother and Father,&quot; one of the best and most personal songs, she sings in a high, child-like voice, repeating a refrain that anyone who's tried to escape childhood ghosts can identify with: &quot;I've got to give it up. I've got to let it go,&quot; Madonna wails, scaling notes. She recites a poem like a nursery rhyme in iambic pentameter recalling her mother's funeral when she was 5 and the traumatic after-effect: &quot;Made a vow that I would never need another person. Never turned my heart into a cage. A victim of a kind of rage.&quot; <br />&quot;American Life&quot; is a classic work of art. To miss it is a mistake. It includes other sophisticated songs like the title track from the latest James Bond flick, &quot;Die Another Day,&quot; as well as &quot;Easy Ride.&quot; It sums up where Madonna is at in the moment - in the here and now, with her finger on the pulse of society. Thinking what we're thinking.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I agree with many of the complaints against this film many others have registered here, but wanted to object to one of the more celebrated aspects of this and the previous Matrix - the so-called fight scenes. First, I'll admit that some people don't care for realism in fight scenes, and that's okay. But for the real martial arts aficionado opinion, read on.<br />Anyone who is impressed with the fighting in the Matrix series obviously hasn't been exposed to the greatest fight choreographer ever, the late Bruce Lee. Bruce's whole martial arts career revolved around plucking the weedy martial arts garden, or, to quote him, to get rid of the impractical aspects of \\"the classical mess\\" of traditional Asian martial arts. His own style, Jeet Kune Do, was designed not to be pretty, or to camouflage the activity of the practitioner (as in the Western Capoeira silliness) but to enable one to defend oneself successfully, period. His fight scenes, then, fought strenuously against the grain of the schlocky Hong Kong kung fu fight movie style that prevailed then. There was still a fair amount of glamour in his fights (lots of high kicking that he personally felt was as effective as \\"punching someone in the knees\\") but compared to the reigning Hong Kong style, they were stunning and brutally honest. For a time, what Bruce set in motion carried a certain momentum. Eventually, with the rise of Jackie Chan's international movie success, a sad reversal has occurred. Chan's fights were more of the same, although often imbued with a certain sense of humor not found in the Hong Kong tradition, which makes sense considering that style's lack of anything approaching reality. <br />In recent years there has been a resurgence of the Hong Kong style, which is what we get with the Matrix. The fight scenes in these films, aside from the special shooting techniques developed by the Wachowski brothers which are already loosing their impact, are simply theatre. For those with any martial arts training, they are just silly, and they unfortunately mislead the general public about the effectiveness of the classical martial arts (with the exception of Thai boxing). (Traditional Western boxing, with all the limitations that fighting only with one's hands and under rules of the ring involve, still produces fighters vastly superior in street situations to masters of traditional arts. The technique of Western boxing is tested fully, while traditional Asian arts are largely theoretical. The only real showing they get is in a highly restricted format, in a ring and with gloved hands and sometimes feet, similar in the end to what occurs in Western boxing. Also, Western boxers, unlike traditional martial artists, know what it's like to hit something other than air, and they know what it feels like to be hit and what it takes to keep hitting back after being hit.)<br />Until another Bruce Lee comes along, or a director with a real affinity for his greatness, unfortunately we will have to sit through more of the same.
0140008217|5.0|This is a story of an aristocratic, very  Catholic family in Protestant England, and of the narrator, a well to do friend of the family who we meet as he enters Oxford, and leave as a middle aged establishment artist.  It is a novel of character, but also of class, religion,  and beauty. It is beautifully written, and is moving, sad and sometimes funny. Part of the genius of this novel is that not only do the characters evolve, but your understanding deepens, so that there is a cumulative impact.  It is a book in which you cannot always take what the characters, including the narrator,  say at face value, not because they are dissimulating, but because they don't have complete insight into themselves.  Extending this idea, I would suggest that Catholicism is not quite as dominant an influence as the book seems to suggest, and that disfunctional parenting plays a major role that the narrator (not to be confused with Waugh) is not sufficiently developed as a human being to appreciate.
B00004SZWB|4.0|To start, the only reason I'm giving this album 4 stars is becuase the review only goes as high as 5 stars. This is not in the same league as Stevie's 70's masterpieces but I still feel that it's one of the best albums of the 80's. The title is basically talking about the world of music being hotter than July. In other words, there's a lot going on in regards to musical taste. At the time of the album release, rock was still going strong, country was becoming more popular, Bob Marley had brought Reggae to the masses, and the world was waiting for a new Stevie Wonder album after the confusing, at least to most of the public, Secret Life OF Plants album. This was it. The album sold quickly and had a top 10 hit with Masterblaster and Happy Birthday. I usually do my reviews by going song by song but this album boast a song so amazing that I have to give it it's due. That song is Lately. First off though, I will mention the other 2 songs that should be given their due too. <BR>Ain't Gonna Stand For It.: Stevie goes country, in a playful way. This song is another romp in the same league as Say it 'Cause I Love Having You Around and Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing. It's a great dance song and in the middle section Stevie really rocks out. Don't take this song seriously. Just have fun with it. <BR>Happy Birthday: This is basically a sing-a-long. Nothing really special musically going on in it. So why am I including it as one of 3 significant songs on the album? Mainly because of the public importance of the song. Can music actually make laws? This one did. Stevie wrote this in honor of Rev. Dr. Martin Luthur King, Jr. and it was the theme song throughout the efforts to make his birthday a national holiday, which Stevie spearheaded. Within one year of campaigning, President Reagan signed the bill to bring the holiday to life. This song will live on as the soundtrack to the campaign and also as the new way we all sing happy birthday at birthday parties around the world.<br />Lately: To me, there are 5 songs that made the 80's. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For by U2, Every Breath You Take by the Police, Billy Jean by Michael Jackson, When Doves Cry by Prince and Lately. Of the 5 Lately is the least known, although in the past few years more and more people have come to know it's greatness. Stevie has always been ahead of his time and Lately is just anothe examlpe of that. Let's look at it on two different levels.<BR>Musically: The song is in a major key but yet 90% of the chords heard are minor 7ths. Something never done before in popular music.When this song originally came out in 1980, these chords were so strange I remember my friends asking, what happened to Stevie? Did he go tone deaf because this whole song is out of tune! Twenty-three years later we hear it and it doesn't sound strange at all. Because of this song, these types of chord arrangements have become common when referring to some of the better artist of the last decade. These minor 7ths help the atmosphere of mystery and confusion in the song. Another interesting thing Stevie does, on the piano part, he continually plays these two 8th notes in the bass section. This represents the thoughts that go through our mind when we suspect that we're losing our lover. With these 8th notes he plays with dissonance. He plays the same note even though the chord has changed. The chorus of the song includes a clash if you will, of huge minor 7th chords that climb to a major. For the climax, he holds down the pedal on the piano that makes the note linger as he plays these chords again. This make for even more dissonance. Why so much? How do you feel when you think you're going to lose your lover? Not too happy and in tune I bet. That's why so much dissonance. At the end of the song Stevie changes keys but not the way it's normally done in popular music. He climbs to three keys higher than the original key of the song. The song finally ends in yet another key that could representeither the end of the relationship or a new beginning. You make the choice. Quincy Jones uses this same technique less than a year later on his classic \\"The Dude album on the song Just Once. Not to mention a number of other songs throughout the 80's and 90's that have used the \\"key change, you make the call\\" trick.<BR>Lyrically: The song is about losing a lover to someone else. In other words, it's about cheatin'. Stevie says he has a feeling that something is going on but doesn't have a really vivid reason to suspect anything. In the chorus, he sings \\"Well I'm a man of many wishes, hope my premonition misses\\". Stevie is the optimist you know. But in this song he speaks for all of us. We don't want to admit the truth. But, as he says, \\"But what I really feel, my eyes won't let me hide. 'Cause they always start to cry. 'Cause this time could mean goodbye\\". A line so simple and yet so powerful. The second verse starts with Stevie wondering why he is with this person, \\"Lately I've been staring in the mirror, very slowly picking me apart. Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart\\". The \\"picking me apart\\" line is really interesting. When you're in a predicament like that, how often have you sat there wondering about yourself? You think, what's wrong with me instead of thinking, why is he/she doing this to me?<BR>Lately is a masterpiece of songwriting. It is an art song in the same league as anything Chopin or Liszt has done. Yet it deals with something that everyone has felt. Whether their rich, poor, educated or not. You will feel this song in your bones. Listen to it again and again. Hotter Than July is a very good album with some good songs on it. Lately brings it up to another level.

B000063JDE|5.0|David Lynch's seminal 1986 masterpiece Blue Velvet opens and closes with the archetypical symbol of American suburbia, a set of luminous red roses.  However, what's in between the film's haunting opening and closing shots shows that every rose has its thorn, as Lynch proceeds to deconstruct Reagan's idealized America by exposing the horrors the lurk beneath the idyllic suburban faade.  Centered around a murder mystery, Blue Velvet follows Jeffrey Beaumont, a college student who becomes slowly lured into an hellish underworld of violence and sado-masochism.  Lynch juxtaposes scenes of Beaumont's innocent suburban world, where he dates the girl-next-door and has shakes at the local diner, with those of the horrific underworld that Jeffrey is strangely intrigued by, even attracted to.  Rich characterization, phenomenal performances, an evocative score, and a dreamy suburban landscape fashioned by cinematopgraher Frederick Elmes all support Lynch's demented, surreal vision of suburbia gone wrong.  Blue Velvet is a brilliant, unforgettable film that is without a doubt worth multiple viewings.
B00004T9UF|3.0|i like the eminem show and slim shady lp better.this is da worst of eminem.itz very dissapointing.some songz are horrible n boring.while otherz are good n catchy most are garbage.i would only recomend dis to hardcore eminem or d12 fans.OR YOU CAN JUST GET THE SLIM SHADY LP OR THE EMINEM SHOW INSTEAD!thats my word.
B000002H97|4.0|I remember when this album came out and how monumental it was.  It spent years on the top 100 chart and its staying power is exemplified by the fact that it is still ranked 81 on the amazon music sales chart!!  Many fans thought the band sold out and I agree.  In retrospect, after listening to previous albums like Master of Puppets, Ride The Lightning and And Justice For All, you can really hear how the band moved away from tight controlled flailing to melodies and formulaic verse/chorus.  Honestly the band did sell out but it was clearly for the better!  This prooves that selling out doesn't neccesarily have to have a neagtive connotation.  The band realized there was only so much they could do in the limiting arena of hardcore heavy metal and how much potential they had as powerfull song writers.  The move clearly worked brilliantly as both a commercial success and an artistic success.  We all know popularity doesn't neccesarily mean artistic brilliance.  The band did such a good job with the music that the album Metallica was able to attract fans who previously had no interest in their music or the genre.  At the time it brought the band regular MTV and mainstream radio rotation.  It turned them from Iron Maiden like popularity to the biggest band of 1991.<br />All monumental albums have to contain the right combination of amazing music and fortunate circumstance for them to become \\"epics\\" and the sales numbers of this album would definitely put it up there with epic.  Its ranked 41st highest of all time and the separation between 41st and 30th is pretty minimal.  One circumsantce that led to this was impeccable timing.  The music world was clearly tired of \\"hair bands\\" and the 80's sound and this turned out to be one of the trio of three (along with Nevermind and Ten) that the public was clearly looking for although this album had the best staying power and overall sales.  Another circumstance was the immensely popular vidoes from the album that played incessantly and established Metallica as a video force to be reckoned with as well.<br />The actual album basically contains hard hitting and cathcy fast paced songs and two powerfull ballads that were the rage at the time.  Enter Sandman, Through The Never, Sad But True and Holier Than Thou are the best of the harder songs.  What is different about these songs is that they maintain the metal edge to a certain degree, but have lyrics that you actually want to listen to and can sing along with.  This made them radio friendly and this album had more mainstream radio hits than all four of Metallica's previousl albums combined.  The two \\"power ballads\\" are superb as well and for the hardcore fans this is what put the album over the edge and ruined it for them.  The songs are emotional, sad and powerfull and they also enjoyed radio play at nauseum and I remeber this attracted the female crowd as well.  The pacing of these songs are key as well as they come 4th and 8th on the album and allow for perfect breathers from the edgier songs.<br />The only downside of this album (besides the confusing self-title-this was dubbed the \\"Black\\" album by many) is that it looses some steam after Nothing Else Matters.  In truth I usually only play it through NEM as it works as the perfect ender and comes at around the 45 minute mark.<br />Bottom Line:  Most incoming college freshman and younger people missed out this phenomenon so you should get this album if you have even an iota of interest.  Anyone who is a fan of bands like Creed, Staind or Nickleback should check this out as these bands clearly were influenced by this (and thier age would put them right in 14-24 age range when this came out) and this is infinitely better than anything they have done.  This would be a great gift for that friend of yours that likes hard/alternative rock but lives under the \\"new is best\\" credo and hasn't explored where bands of today came from.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I get what the director was trying to do with this film.  The cinematography, editing and acting are all top notch.  The sense of place is very real and immediate.  BUT...This is not entertainment.  Art?  Maybe.  I love a dark/disturbing movie just as much as the next guy/girl.  But this film is sick and twisted (the rape scene goes on way too long).  Unecessary.  We get the point after the first minute or two...I don't know...I guess this is either one of the most daring films to be made in the last few years or one of the worst.  Shouldn't a movie be something you want to view again though?  This is definitely not one of those movies.  If it helps from a critic standpoint I love Blue Velvet, Requiem for a Dream, Heavenly Creatures...But this one is...I don't know.... rent first...Do not buy this without having seen it first.
B00000I2PG|5.0|I have owned this album on vinyl, cassette, and CD and will continue to make it my first purchase in whatever new mediums rise in the future.<br />Ever get dumped?  I mean thrown to the ground, broken hearted, the world must hate you dumped?<br />So has Martin Fry, lead singer and songwriter for ABC.  On this album, he and the band's original line up manage to capture the agony and ecstacy of love, both through his clever lyrics and through the lush production of Trevor Horn.<br />Highlights include &quot;All of My Heart,&quot; &quot;Date Stamp&quot; and, of course, the singles &quot;Poison Arrow&quot; and &quot;Look of Love.&quot;  <br />In my opinion, this is a &quot;must own&quot; album for anyone who has ever experienced a heartbreak.
0451523938|4.0|The classic tale of Dr. Jekyll struggling with his inner demon, Mr. Hyde.  The story is told mainly from the point of view of Mr. Utterson, the lawyer of Dr. Jekyll, who is trying to find out who Mr. Hyde is.<br />This is a great book, one of those classics that everyone should read at least once. Stevenson gives great descriptions of the battle between Jekyll and Hyde. I highly recommend it.
B000067CPX|4.0|...and before that, the CD I got before this one I bought in 1999. This was my first CD purchase in 4 years, so I was hoping to not be let down. I already had Blood Sugar Sex Magic and was given Californication. This one, By The Way, is nuts! I can't think of any _bad_ songs. There are some that I don't prefer as much as others (I prefer \\"Tear\\" to \\"Cabron\\" while most people prefer the reverse), but they are all very good. Many of them have a \\"cool\\" feel to them. Then, of course, there's \\"The Zephyr Song\\" which is just a whole 'nother experience. <br />Call me crazy, but I think some of these songs' lyrics are about drug addiction, ESPECIALLY \\"Dosed\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" ('in time I want to be your best friend/ eastside love is living on the west end'... there's a deeper meaning there), but that does not at all take away from the overall quality of the album. I put this CD on and let it spin on repeat forever. This is one that everyone should own... not download and burn, go out and pay [$$] for it. It's worth it and will add depth to any music collection.
B00008S7ZW|4.0|Everyone I talked to who had seen this movie didn't like it very much, but I like Jennifer Aniston, and it was on cable so I decided to watch it.  It's about a 30 year old woman who hates her life, her job, and her husband; she has a fling with a 22 year old she works with who hates his life even more than she does. <BR>This movie is mainly a drama, but it also has some funny parts. The characters are pretty believable, and one can relate to them, especially Justine (Aniston's character). I also like this movie because it is so different than what we are use to seeing Jennifer Aniston do.  I enjoyed it.
0345409671|2.0|I hate to suggest that this is anything less than four stars for the wonderful Vampire Chronicles, but I have to be honest: this is kind of a letdown. But I also have to say that is was not entirely unexpected, at least on my part. My personal tastes regarding the Vampire Chronicles is the history and adventures of the vampires. Rice is a very unique author in that she blends rich, textural description with historical accuracy. That, to me (and many others) is what made her books so interesting. With Memnoch the Devil, she forsakes that to tell an interesting, but flawed story. <br />First of all, my main complaint is that this really didn't have to be a book of the Vampire Chronicles. This story could have happened to a mortal man as well as a vampire. Every novel before this, from \\"Interview\\" to \\"Tale of the Body Thief\\" was centered around the vampire experience and/or told from the point of view of a vampire. Memnoch the Devil is a story that could be told by any person, so in that regard it loses points for failing to live up to the rest of the books in terms of a vampiric adventure. <br />Secondly, the book drags, which is something fairly unusual for a Rice novel, as she can usually make the most mundane of stories interesting. Some passages seem a little boring or pretentious in description. I had to re-read a page or two every time I picked it back up and it took me the longest of the Chronicles to finish. Another thing that I dislike, although many will consider minor, is that there were not enough of the other vampires present in this novel, although I am probably spoiled from reading Queen of the Damned. Louis, Armand, David, and extremely brief appearances by Maharet and Mael are all there is. David is only second to Lestat, and he is the least interesting of vampires, as far as I am concerned. Still, it was good to see Armand and Louis make a reappearance, though it was odd that Marius couldn't be in this one, especially near the end. The ending, also,is a little too unbelievable for me, with the plot involving Veronica's Veil (which I won't mention here). It requires alot of faith on the part of the reader, which many may not be able to stomach.<br />All bad things aside, this is actually a very intersting story. Rice's conception of Christianity and the Creation is an interesting one that manages to weave alot of different beliefs into a huge tapestry and still make it believable, although this book requires huge suspensions of disbelief for the most part. Reincarnation, Creationism, and Evolution are all convincingly (for the most part) woven into an interesting conception of the creation of the universe. Her views on God and the Devil are especially interesting, with each seeming to take on the other's role at various times. It is a far cry from the Christian Bible's portrayal of God, and it manages to raise a few questions: can the Devil loath his position? Can God be all-powerful? Her Catholic upbringing is very obvious in many parts of the book, especially in the descriptions of Heaven, which includes the famous Nine Choirs, and all manner of angels, including Michael and Gabriel. Memnoch's position is especially interesting, and very different from all the other preconceptions of the Devil and his actions. <br />The other good point to this book is that Rice manages not to totally abandon her style: she revels in discriptions of historical events, no matter how brief, from the Crucifixion, to the Fourth Crusade desecration of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Scenes and battles are described very accurately and thoughtfully, not submitting to literary embellishment, like alot of romanticizing authors. <br />Still, this book will probably disappoint most expecting a more \\"contemporary\\" vampire adventure. I still think the story itself is fairly good, but could have been better as a seperate novel in its own right, with more description of the fall of Memnoch and the arguements between Memnoch and God. Vampiressimply aren't necessary to this story, which, to me, is not really an edition of the Vampire Chronicles at all.
B00008EY9G|4.0|I admit I wasn't sure if I liked Identity when it was over. The performances are superb and the film is always engaging but the big twist I find clever yet disapointing at the same time. Part of me wishes it stayed focus as a horror/thriller about motel guests being targeted by a killer. In the 2nd act everything changes and I was both surprised and shocked but again disapointed like I said. It's still an extremely original, smart and creepy film though. It keeps you guessing and has one impossible to predict twist after another. If you like  Identity I recommend Raising Caine with John Lithgow as well although it's not as good.
B0000797IO|5.0|Excellent acting, excellent characters.  It had an interesting storyline that kept me curious.  I loved it.  Watched it last night- kept thinking about it today.
0156027321|5.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; could well have been a simple child's fable that Martel has evolved into a brilliant novel, packed with surprises.<br />The basis of the book is essentially a tale about a boy's survival at sea that the author ingeniously spiced up in all sorts of ways (with all sorts of animals). By telling us how he supposedly met Pi, the account of his childhood and giving immaculate details throughout the voyage, Martel presents readers with captivating roles and an uncommonly believable setting. Then there is also the dreamy side with those various miracles, unusual events and delusions towards the end. The final encounter between Pi and the Japanese could be a light attempt at some 'moral lesson' as a fable would, otherwise thought-provoking, and a time I took to recapture the moments in the story again.<br />In the thoughtful 100 chapters, Martel's lively story-telling really takes us into Pi's voyage, puts the character in our hearts, or maybe even shed some light on tackling the tough times in life.
B00005JKN9|2.0|As a fan of all types of movies in various genres and with a taste for historical drama I just can't believe this flick is even considered to be passable.  About the only redeeming quality was the expose on the Five Points in the mid 1800's.  Insipid plot lines, wacky dramatic acting (are we expected to believe the DD Lewis character is crying over a dead rabbit after dispatching a dozen men at least with various knives, hence his name the butcher...).  See it if you must but don't expect to be impressed, Scorcese was out to lunch on this one...
B00005JLYW|5.0|Don't analysis the movie, don't worry if the special effects are realistic (Like the Matrix is realistic?!?!), and Demi Moore looks damn good for a woman in her 40's.  Just enjoy watching the Angels kick some [booty].  This is still one of the best power chick flicks I have ever seen.  It's meant to be a fun movie and that is exactly what it is.
020530902X|4.0|The second edition of this classic work improved on the first edition, and the third was the best of all. It was perfection. The fourth, posthumous edition slips a little bit. It's still better than any other style guide, but a hint of Political Correctness has crept into some of its advice and examples. Why did the publishers feel the need to tinker with perfection? If you already have the third edition, don't bother getting the new one. If you don't have any copies of this great book, check the used bookstores for the previous edition.
0385504209|1.0|To start with, I do not intend to buy this book.  The source materials are from people want to change Christianity, particularly the Catholic Church, to fit their view of what a religion should be like.  None of the sources for this book are ancient, and none agree with the most ancient texts of the New Testiment, and some even disagree with the early Gnostic documents that we still have.<br />This book is fiction, based on lies, portraying itself as religious truth.  We are warned in the Bible (which I highly recommend to anyone who wants to read this book) to be on the watch for people who portray themselves as apostles for another Jesus.  St. Paul reminds us that there is only one Jesus.  For Christians, protect your faith, avoid this book!  For non-Christians who want to learn about the ancient Christian Churches I would recommend the book &quot;Ecclisial History&quot; by Eusibius, written in the Third Century, the Bible itself, or the Catechism of the Catholic Church.<br />Warning, this book may be an attack on your faith.  Read it at your own peril!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Having seen his progression over the years, Gavin continues to impress.  His voice strong, lyrics meaningful and production impressive, he has nowhere to go but up.  Buy this album and you will not be disappointed, and if you like the album, catch him live, his interaction and stage presence will convince you that he will be a star...and soon!
B00004Y7SF|1.0|There's no reason to give this album any stars! I bought this album around Christmas time a few years ago mainly because I liked Christina's dance remix of \\"Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire\\".  When I listened to the rest of the album, I was about to turn this CD into a yulelog. If she were a contestant on American Idol, Simon Cowell would say, \\"That was bloody awful! I mean, the worst singing voice, period!\\" And I couldn't agree more! Christina damn near ruined my holiday spirit by killing the entire idea of Christmas.  She butchered many of my favorite Christmas songs, such as \\"Have Yourself...\\", \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\", and  \\"O Holy Night\\"--she does way too many melismas, runs, and other crazy things. She can't even hold a single note for one second because she's all over the board doing crazy things to her singing voice.  It's soulful in many ways, but a disappointment to others.  Leave this Christina album alone.  Where's Bing Crosby when you need him? Don't waste your money on this junk!
B0000A36J5|5.0|First I would like to say that this was an excellent movie.  Yes, there are differences from the book.  As someone who loved the books, I was originally put off by the differences in the movie, but after watching the DVD a few times, I realized that my objection wasn't to the differences in how the movie flowed, but in how the producers seemed to view the audience.  Both Faramir and Treebeard initially make decisions inconsistent with the book till a few scenes later where they switch their decisions back.  I assume this was done for impact to the audience as Treebeard (being a shepherd of the forest) would have been aware of the destruction to the trees beforehand (as he did in the book) and Faramir - had he truly been under the influence of the ring and been in its presence long enough to travel to Osgiliath, would certainly have not released Frodo.  Both of these seemed to be changed for the visual impact to the audience though it somewhat falls short in Faramir's case IMO.  Adding the Elves to Helms Deep also seemed unnecessary as the same result could have been obtained by adding (as was in the book) more Riders.  Last and probably worst for me was the twisting of the Elrond/Arwen role to that of a 14 year old girl vs. her father (presumably for the 14 year old girls in the audience).  No aspect of that was in the books as both Elrond and Arwen knew their duties to themselves and others.  In todays time of self-indulgence, however, maybe this would have been completely lost on the audience.<br />People have said that it would have been a 15 hour movie to be true to the book, but these scenes actually added to the length unnecessarily IMO.  I do not believe that attendence or sales of the film would have been hurt had those scenes been done more true to the book, but I am not a producer.<br />All of that having been said, these things make up just a small portion of the movie.  So much of the movie IS true to the spirit and letter of the book that it is more than worth the 5 stars I gave it.  I am looking forward to seeing the extended scenes from the Two Towers as well as the Return of the King later this year.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Despite all the bad reviews here, I thought Matrix Reloaded was better than the first. It was more inventive with more colorful villains and more mystery in determining who are these new villains and what do they exactly mean to Neo and the Matrix.<br />The Zion orgy scene that everyone complains about is simply to establish the difference between the humans and the machines... love, passion, sex. It's what set the humans apart. It also makes you question, why Persephone has a need to sample Neo's kiss. <br />I look very much forward to Matrix Revolutions
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is my favorite CD that I own by far. Radiohead has to be one of the greatest bands ever to play rock music. Ok Computer has so many unbelievable songs it's hard to start somewhere. Thom Yorke's vocals are amazing and the guitar on every song is beyond words. My favorite songs on this album include:<br />Airbag - a great opener for the band<BR>Paranoid Android - One of the best songs in history!<BR>Subterranean Home Sick Alien - Great!<BR>Exit Music - Great guitar one of my favorites<BR>Karma Police - Who can't love this song<BR>Fitter Happier - Great!<BR>Electioneering - Amazing!<BR>Climbing up the Walls - I heard this song live and was truly amazed at how well Radiohead captured the song live. Great song.<BR>No surprises - No surprises here great song<BR>Lucky - An excellent Radiohead song!<BR>The Tourist - Great closing song for a great record!<br />Every song is my favorite!<br />OK Computer is a must have album!<BR>If you get the chance check them out live<br />A must have CD!
0142000663|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath tells the story of the Joad family, a poor farming family who have been forced off their land and journeyed west to California in search of prosperity. The story of their continuing hardships gives the reader a personal connection to the plight of the poor population during the Depression.<br />This was an excellent novel, putting the human face on one of the darkest periods of our American history.
0812550706|4.0|When I first read this book, I was in junior high school and I don't think I really had an appreciation for all that was included in the book.  This summer I picked up the book again and started reading.  I was captivated, the book hooked me instantly and I couldn't put it down until it was finished (which was unfortunately only a few hours later).  <br />I definitely enjoyed reading it, and I'd recommend it to others.  However, if you are picking it up with the thought that it is an excellent piece of literature packed full of political philosophy that will change the way you live, you should probably find something else.  I praise this book mostly for its entertainment value.  The book relies on some cliched techniques to hook the reader, but it works.  However, I think the book loses a little bit of value for me towards the end when Card attempts to wax philosophical.  I think that Card steps into some very deep issues and fundemental problems with society, but I also think that he doesn't get any further than the wading pool.  The political thought references and the genius of Ender is impressive and enjoyable, but I think that Card is trying too hard to make the book into something that it isn't.  <br />I'm looking forward to reading the sequels and despite my criticism, I give this book four stars and I strongly recommend it.  Just don't take it into your philosophy class.
B000066NW0|4.0|I think that this album of Avril is really cool, she seems like a very free girl and I really like that.
0142004235|5.0|I just finished this novel. And I am totally speechless and in awe of Steinbeck's writing. I am also wondering why I have never read it before! This book would make Shakespeare proud! As most English Lit majors in college would know ~~ that Shakespeare is the world's most acclaimed playwright ~~ he writes about every emotion under the sun known to man and he makes the audience see and feel the stories that is very familiar to mankind. Steinbeck's East of Eden should be regarded in the same category. This may be a drama, but it is a reflection on humankind ~~ men who seeks to find the gold in their dreams and experience everything that is known to mankind. These men, Charles Trask, Adam Trask, Cal Trask, Aron Trask, Samuel Hamilton, Lee have sought happiness at their whim and some succeeded and others didn't. They reacted to whatever life throws their way ~~ either with strength and courage or with cowardice. No man is alike in this book and yet they are. Even the women handled things differently in this book. There is Cathy/Kate, the eternal whore and there is Abra Bacon, the eternal mother-figure. <br />Please don't be discouraged by the long descriptive pages that Steinbeck employed to introduce his characters. They only serve to enrich the novel and make these people come alive between these pages and in your imagination. This is a classic book and it flows easily between the pages. It is also one of the most lyrical writing I have yet to read. Steinbeck's talent is that he makes people come alive and tell their stories of their struggles with guilt, sin and love. It is a book that will touch you immensely and you will not forget these people.<br />It's a definite must-read for any serious reader.<br />9-5-03
0553382179|5.0|I heard about FlyLady online a year or so ago. I had recently bought a house with my fiance, and I was having trouble keeping it tidy. Even though we have no children, we DO have four pets and both work full time, so things were sort of going to pot. I signed up for her online reminders, read the Web site and then bought the book. (I like reading books better than I do Web pages!)<br />I think this system is amazing. FlyLady is very encouraging (though some might find her a bit saccharin) and keeps you from feeling overwhelmed with her reminders to &quot;take babysteps.&quot; She concentrates on developing morning, afternoon and evening routines that help you keep you on track. (For example, my evening routine consists of running the dishwasher, feeding the pets, laying out an outfit for the next day,<br />She also divides your house up into &quot;zones&quot; -- groups of one to three rooms. Every day, you clean in your zone for 15 minutes and do one zone mission that she sends out via e-mail or posts on her Web site. These are usually something very easy, like &quot;sweep your front porch.&quot; There is one &quot;home blessing hour&quot; a week, where you dust and vacuum your house. (As she says, &quot;It doesn't have to be perfect!&quot;) My husband has allergies, so I need to do a little more in-depth cleaning; I clean one room a day instead of all the rooms at once.<br />The beauty of this system is that it is flexible. FlyLady has many testimonials on her Web site that include advice for FlyBabies who work outside the home, who have large families, who are pregnant, who homeschool, etc.<br />As for the reviewer who said FlyLady sends scathing e-mails to those who disagree with her, I have never heard of such a thing. I've been on her list for quite some time and have never seen a rude or unkind e-mail.
B000002U9Y|2.0|First of all let me say that I have been a huge Pink Floyd Fan for about 20 years.  A friend let me borrow &quot;The Wall&quot; and I was hooked.  I have all of their albums and think they are probably the greatest band of all time.  A few of their early albums were experimental, and I appreciate them for this, but overall a lot of the early stuff was just building the foundation for their better albums to come.  I have always been very interested in Syd Barrett, but never much of a fan of his music.  Piper at the Gates of Dawn is a much better album than Saucer.  I'm surprised so many people indicate that Saucer has no week songs, because Corporal Clegg is right up there with Seamus as probably one of the worst songs ever recorded by PF.  Saucer finds the band without a leader, and I find the album to lack cohesiveness, and at times darn difficult to listen to.  It is obvious to me it is a combination of what little Syd had left to offer, combined with the rest of the members taking their initial effort at writing music.  The result is at best interesting from a historical propective, but not really all that good.  Personally, I think the band never really hit stride until Meddle, and from that point on, it was all great.  I know many people, including David Bowie, disagree with me, but that is my humble opinion.
B000062YAZ|3.0|This has the be the most funny album I have ever ever heard, angel of death with its old skool roots brings together a funny and theatrical atmosphere. Slayer are sheer on stage geniouses with their abilities to make their audiences chuckle. Most say Slayer are extreme, but i would suggest they are more like extremists. Their extremist lyrics make the best of us wet our pants, with only the unimaginative taking them seriously as if they were some satanic force. Slayers groupies and fans, take them so seriously, but if they only knew they were actually part of the commercialised theatrical scene, and sucked in to an underworld stage they would be even more astounded. This album is a must for those who wish to have the odd tune or two in their car for the long journeys, it really brings a smile to ones face. I have liked Slayer ever since their beginnings, from going to their concerts and listening to them on the radio on the way to many a caravan site, in a gorgeous location such as Cornwall in the Astra. I put it to you if you are thinking about buying this album, please do not be fooled into thinking it is heavy or evil, it is merely comical genious, and in my opinion FANTASTIC!!! BUY IT!!!
0790733226|5.0|This is a movie for anyone who's spent a night gazing up at the stars in the sky and wondered if there is other intelligent life in the universe. Contact perfectly captures the awe and wonder of realizing just how small and insignificant we are on Earth in comparison to the rest of the universe.<br />Jodie Foster conveys an infectious enthusiasm for knowledge that is such a refreshing change from the usual scientist-type normally depicted in science fiction films. You can't help but get caught up in her quest for signs of intelligent life in the universe and sympathize with her frustrations from fellow colleagues and government types.<br />The supporting cast is also excellent -- in particular, William Fichtner as a blind scientist (based on a real person, btw) is a real stand-out. He normally plays psychos or bad guys in movies and so it is really great to see him cast completely against type as a gentle soul who is very loyal to Foster's character.<br />The DVD is quite good in quality -- although, the extras do tend to lean to the special effects aspects of the film, which gets a little dull after awhile. However, the film's three audio commentaries are all good listens -- especially Jodie Foster who talks about her own personal passion for the project.<br />Contact makes a great double bill with another film, October Sky, which is also another story about a character in love with gazing up into the stars. Both of these films are based on real stories and are very well made. Definitely worth a look.
0345442970|5.0|This was a great novel and deserves more stars than I can give it. It also explains many questions you had before (EX: Why were the Trade Lanes taxed?). <br />The plot is simple: Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn is obsessed with finding the elusive pirate: Captain Cohl after the destruction of a Trade Federation Starship and the escape of Cohl. Supreme Chancellor Valorum then hopes to solve all problems by taxing the trade lanes and calls an emergency summit. After an assassination attempt on Valorum by the Nebula Front (a terrorist group opposed to the Trade Federation) is stopped by Qui-Gon and another Jedi, the summit is under heavy guard and the Jedi are employed. While all this is happening, the fearful Nute Gunray joins forces with the shadowy Darth Sidious. With action packed battle sequences and mind treats of politcal base, this story will keep your attention to the thrilling climax, with some twists and turns along the way. <br />How will it all turn out? Read and see! This one is for the people who avidly read EU and for those who don't alike. Buy this one, its DEFINITELY worth the money!
B00005MP58|5.0|So good I watched it into the wee hours of the night, and then sat down on a Sunday morning with my husband and watched the entire mini-series start to finish that day!! Bravo.<BR>Colin Firth is amazing, Jennifer Ehle is outstanding.  These are probably the best performances of their careers.<BR>This is the best thing I've ever seen on TV in 40 years.  Better than Shogun, Thorn Birds, Scruples, Taken, Storm of the Century, or anything else!  Everyone I know who's watched it has loved it.  Mr. Bennet is OUTSTANDING, Mrs. Bennet perfect in her role.  The casting was perfect.  Whoever cast the roles in the film deserves an oscar.  The sister Jane and Mr. Bingley were perfect, the annoying sister Lydia was perfect.  No one could have done a better adaptation of this wonderful novel.  If you've seen it, or once you've seen it, go and read the novel to pick up all the little details.  <BR>NOT TO BE MISSED!
B00000258J|5.0|In April, 1978, it was my immense privilege to see Muddy Waters live in Austin, Texas at Antones blues club. (The Fabulous Thunderbirds opened for him and were, well, fabulous, as usual.)There he was, dressed to the nines, stolling on stage to the accompaniment of his legendary band, his huge, baby face split wide in an immense grin, working his way through one masterpiece after another. It's a night I will never forget. Well, Hard Again was the album that first piqued my interest in this legend, and after 25 years, still holds up great. Producer and famed guitarist Johnny Winter leads Muddy, super harpist James Cotton, and an all-star band through one classic after another. &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; is one of the very best performances by Muddy ever captured on vinyl, with Muddy howling, Johnny screaming and James Cotton wailing on harp. In &quot;Cross-eyed Cat,&quot; Muddy spins the fascinating tale about a woman living with a creature who is &quot;too big to be a housecat and too small to be a lion...There's something wrong!!!&quot; More great work by Cotton on this number and by Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith on drums. &quot;I Can't Be Satisfied,&quot; features Johnny taking several excellent solos on his steel-bodied National guitar, while &quot;The Blues Had A Baby And They Named It Rock And Roll&quot; finds Muddy telling his version of the birth of the music, accompanied by Pinetop Perkins excellent piano figures. In short, this is the album that gave Muddy Waters his well-deserved renaissance, and allowed him to die happy just a few years later knowing that his place in music history was assured.
B000023X9W|5.0|How can music, so simple catch your heart! The melodies are soft but this is no softies album, because the feelings are real!<br />I do not like so much, the very noisy Neil Young, though I have to admit I love &quot;on the beach&quot;, Tonights the night and Zuma.<br />But this, it is just marvelous and it brings me in a fantastic mood! Highly recomended!

B000002H70|4.0|IF YOU'D HAD TO OWN ONLY ONE CD IN YOUR LIFE, THEN DISINTEGRATION IS THE ONE YOU SHOULD HAVE.<BR>BRILLIANT...ATMOSPHERIC...MELODIC...SENSITIVE...MUSIC!!!
B0000009SI|5.0|Some healthy advice Zappa gives - Never eat yellow snow. That should be a lesson to anyone unless they want to be the next in a new wave of Jackass stunt daredevils<br />Still as for the album itself it is one big story that doesn't make sense but that doesn't really matter. The music is good and that's that. Apostrophe ( the track ) is one of the best instrumentals ever recorded on tape and for that this album must be bought.<br />Enjoy
0140186409|4.0|This novel takes place during the &quot;Great Depression&quot; and gives a general view of the 1930's, but also follows the Joad family as they endure many struggles on their way to find work in California. Like thousands of other families, they encounter hunger, violence, and despair during these troubled years of our history.<br />This was kind of a difficult book to get through, but if you want to learn about the affect the &quot;Great Depression&quot; had on everyday families and the struggles they encountered during this time, then you have found the right book.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Back in late April I got word that this epic movie would be shown once on the 22nd of June, a Sunday, on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at 6PM Eastern. Generally, I don't remember such details, but a movie like OUTW is a rare film that should be considered by ANY lover of the cinema, especially those interested in independent flicks, cinematic musical scores or film production. I made mention in a forum discussing OUTW in June that a DVD should be coming out soon since the wide screen transfer (which looked like a direct transfer from the original print), was aired on TCM and discovered now that it would finally be released!<br />About letterboxed and pan & scan: If you liked the movie while watching the butchered versions on television from years ago, you'll be amazed at the wide screen transfer, since the movie was filmed in Techniscope @ 2.35:1. Some of you shudder at the new \\"letterbox\\" release of movies, feeling that the film is not filling your standard TV screen, but this reviewer is a photographer who understands how cropping kills what an image is trying to show. You'll actually be getting the other part of the movie that the television execs chopped off to fit the movie onto your screen. Some still don't understand how this works, so at the bottom, I'll give you an example that might help.<br />Sergio Leone intended this movie to be seen in widescreen on a large screen, and your 19\\" typical television really doesn't do justice to the film. I'm sure he's smiling more now since his films can be appreciated on larger screen TVs or the projection monitors in the aspect he had intended. But make no mistake. You should easily be entertained by watching OUTW on any screen because it's simply that great.<br />From Sergio Leone to Carlo Leva (an uncredited member of the set decoration team) and from Henry Fonda to Luana Strode (the Indian woman, uncredited in the movie and actually the wife of late actor Woody Strode, who plays Stony [the bald man] in the opening scene), every member of the cast and crew gave their all in the production of this movie, which I consider one of the best epic movies ever made. Why? Everything comes together. The story, lighting, framing, acting, and those amazing close-ups in which Leone brought out the intensity of the eyes. Watch the eyes, because the way the actors used theirs is incredible.<br />You'll see that the film grabbed you when you start whistling or humming the music (Ennio Morricone's scores) even decades after watching it. The music is still in my head after I first saw it on TV in the 1970s. A particular thanks and sincere homage to Leone, Fonda, Strode, Frank Wolff, Jason Robards, Al Mulock, and most recently, Charles Bronson. They and all others involved in OUTW who have passed are timeless with the production and release of this beautiful movie.<br />Okay, for the ones who want to understand about letterbox... this is a crude but effective way to demonstrate what happens when a movie is \\"reformmated to fit your screen.\\"  Find a business envelope and draw a simple sunset scene where the sun is on the extreme left and two stickfigure people are on the extreme right. Imagine the scene as real in your mind and then with your pretty scene facing you, stand in front of your TV set and hold it between you and the set until the vertical edges of the envelope match up with the edges of the screen. As you mask the TV with the envelope, you'll see those same bars above and below on your set which demonstrates the letterboxing on your TV. Now, pull your picture towards you until 3 sides of the envelope meet up with 3 of the 4 sides of the edges of your screen behind it. Once you do that, fold the envelope back where the remaining 4th edge of the screen meets behind your drawing. The 2/3rds of the picture you folded back represent your TV screen format. The other part (either the sunset or the people enjoying it) would be cropped if your image were transferred to your TV screen to fill it. The envelope's size represents what the film format of OUTW is. That part of the envelope you folded back is the amount of movie that has to be cropped out, or \\"reformmatted\\" to fit your TV, which effectively kills the moment. The cropped areas are what should be restored in the DVD, scenes that enhance the enjoyment of what Leone intended you to really see.The envelope's size represents what the film format of OUTW is.

B00000HYXB|5.0|This album has been slammed by many for a mainly non-musical issue: interludes. Interludes on any album are an acquired taste. While I found the interludes to be a particularly nice touch, this is beside the point.<br /><br />The metal on this album, its composition, and its crafting are BG's best. During their concerts, they are the songs people cheer for the most, and for a reason: if you read Tolkien's timeless epic, the Silmarillion (which is the 'Old Testament' of the Lord of the Rings trilogy), the interludes will make sense and will be appreciated for their addition because they help anchor the narrative of the concept in the mind of the listener.<br /><br />Hansi and co. sing and play on NIME with a passion not found on any other BG release. The singing is EVIL on 'Into the Storm', sorrowful on 'Nightfall', urgent on 'Mirror Mirror', and commanding on 'Thorn' and 'Time Stand Still' , all backed by galloping drums and furious guitar interplay soaked in tasteful orchestral arrangements that give the majesty these songs need.<br />Melodies evoking ancient elven and dwarven realms and their folk remain in your head forever. There are no weak tracks, and every single song offers a new atmosphere while staying faithfully lodged within the main context of the Silmarillion epic. The music on NIME alternates from solemn and lamenting 'Nightfall', the gothic and ominous 'Blood Tears', the cavalry charge of 'Mirror Mirror', to soaring passages like in 'Thorn' and 'Time Stand Still'. The wide palette of feelings and atmospheres results in a brilliant slab of power metal and one of my top 10 best power metal albums ever. For Tolkien fans, it also serves as a tremendous tribute to the Silmarillion. Blind Guardian never regained the passion and fury of NIME on subsequent albums and only recently managed to brush NIME's greatness with their excellent 'At the Edge of Time'.<br /><br />We can argue endlessly about the 'cheesiness' of this album and even some have called it 'goofy'. It's a matter of perspective: those who AREN'T interested in epic sagas translated into metal music will surely laugh this band off and this is really a matter of taste. Can't argue about tastes and colors.<br /><br />This is grade AAA epic power metal and for the fans of the genre, a must in their collection.oofy'.

6305350205|3.0|With this movie it seemed that Star Trek was winding down, but on the other side TNG was taking off. It is still good old Star Trek fun in spite of a poor plot, terrible scenes and low budget visual effects. On the other hand it follows the comic tradition of Star Trek IV and the original series and it is still a human adventure. For Trek fans it is good to see William Shatner's perspective on the nature of the series but as Trek movies go it is probably the worst (after Nemesis).

0001712071|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter's first birthday.  I liked the strong beat and the rhymes, although I was worried she wouldn't understand the non-realistic drawings and that she wouldn't have a clue what a cork is (so why should she care if it goes pop-pop).  Obviously I am not a very experienced mom.  She was CRAZY about this book from the get-go. In six weeks she learned all the sounds so that you could stop anywhere in the rhyme and she would finish it: Me: \\"he can sound like an rooster\\" Her: \\"Cockalooloo [close!]\\" Me: \\"he can sound like an owl\\" Her: \\"hoo hoo hoo.\\" This book was as compelling to my baby as a song and the pictures made it in some ways even better than a song since she could understand the words. I am very glad it is a board book because it has been covered with food and liquids and would be in shreds if it were not. I would recommend this book 100% to any parent of a 1 year old.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is superb as Susie Hendrix, a recently blinded woman in New York whose photographer husband is frequently away on assignments. This leaves her on her own to fend for herself and adjust to being blind. Thugs Richard Crenna and Jack Weston invade Susie's apartment while she is in \\"blind school\\" looking for a woman accomplice they know who led them there. But it's a set-up by slimier thug Alan Arkin who has killed the woman and forces Crenna and Weston to join him in searching for a doll containing heroin that Arkin knows is in the apartment somewhere. He knows that the woman slipped it to Sam, Susie's husband, at the airport. Sam, of course, not knowing what was in it, brought it home. Susie is then subjected to dupes, harrassment and then outright terror as the trio try to retrieve the doll. A neighbor girl, Gloria, is her only aid. Yet Susie begins to rely on what she already had---her wits and her senses---to survive at the hands of Arkin, the sickest and deadlier of the trio of thugs. \\"Wait Until Dark\\" is a fine, gripping thriller that builds slowly and surely to it's terrifying climax as Susie and Roat, Jr. (Arkin) are left to square off. Arkin does some neat turns in disguises in his efforts to trick Susie. Crenna is almost likeable as the coolest of the trio while Weston is sweaty and nervous. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (\\"The FBI\\") is OK as Sam and Julie Herrod is good as Gloria the young neighbor, a troubled girl who proves her worth to Susie. Then you have Henry Mancini's effectively suspenseful score...he did a LOT of 60's films...so this is a memorable treat as a whole. The DVD print is fine and the sound is good. But I would love to know who the smooth female vocalist is who sings the title song \\"Wait Until Dark\\" over the cast list at the end. I didn't see her credited. Film is based on Frederick Knox's famous Broadway play.

I write myself (Bible research) and I don't think an author copying someone else's work is worthy of reading.<br />Okay, so &quot;Daugher of God&quot; has some unusual things in it (me a Baptist).  But if you don't stretch you're mind once in a while you will never learn.  Take a chance - be brave.
B0000041BX|2.0|This is a nice recording in terms of audio quality and string technique, but musically I found it unsatisfying.  The Quartetto Italiano, with whom I am not particularly familiar, is, in these recordings notable for having a consistently very sweet sound marked by a somewhat muffled tone and a slow vibrato.  This does make for a few beautiful moments, but the lack of contrast, especially when performing works from a composer who so effectively and so poignantly confronts the listener with darkness is unsatisfying.  <br />In addition to the passive sound, the quartet seems to have trouble keeping the momentum of the music moving.  To begin with, the tempi are generally slow, but as phrases come to an end, QI inevitably slows down even more and wallows in the atmospheric connective tissue between phrases that Schubert so carefully composed.  However, rather than emphasizing the atmosphere, I found it distracting.  &quot;Was the quartet on Valium?&quot; I found myself wondering while waiting for the music to begin again.<br />While primarily thought of as tender and contemplative, I think Schubert's music also is marked by a certain urgency that is completely missing in these recordings (especially notable the Death and the Maiden and the Quartettsatz).<br />Not recommended.

She totally related then to \\"A piece of sky\\" sung by Barbra Streisand and little time after shes at a University doing her best to achieve what she wants most: a degree at college.

B00008PX8P|5.0|It has been 48 hours since I got my hands on this 2-disc Led Zeppelin DVD and it has been pretty much playing around the clock (yes, it just keeps repeating while I am asleep).  I thought the 3-CD \\"How the West Was Won\\" set was pretty good, but it is nothing compared to what is on these two DVDs, which make \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" look like a student film.  There are some songs from the same 1973 Madison Square Garden concerts from which Page put together that Led Zeppelin concert film so you can really see how much work has been put into making the lads look good.  One of the reasons I was never overly impressed with \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" was that I already had several bootleg albums of Led Zeppelin concerts from that same period, so I pretty much had live versions of everything that was in the film (albeit, with inferior sound).  Consequently I am aware that the tracks I really enjoy playing over and over again more than the rest are the ones from really early and very late in Led Zeppelin's career.  This would be the \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" and \\"How Many More Times\\" along with the three tracks from Danish Television on Disc 1 for the former and the songs from \\"Physical Graffiti\\" (\\"In My Time of Dying,\\" \\"Trampled Underfoot,\\" and \\"Kashmir\\") and \\"Presence\\" (\\"Achilles Last Stand\\") on Disc 2 for the latter.  Just be sure you play EVERYTHING, because sometimes you get nice moments just from the MENUS.  Hyperbole is not possible with this one, it is just too good.<br />There are just Sometimes the thrill comes from the little things, such as when Page works the riff from \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" into the slow bluesy part of \\"How Many More Times\\" and when Robert Page starts singing lines from \\"Gallows Pole\\" in \\"Trampled Underfoot.\\"  It also goes without saying that you can never have too many versions of \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" but I especially like seeing exactly what John Bonham is doing with that rather basic and bare boned drum kit coming out of Page's bow-stringed guitar solo, and what about that spangled jacket John Paul Jones was wearing at one point.  I even like grainy hand-head Super 8 footage of \\"Immigrant Song\\" mixed in with the rest of the polished concert footage.  There is just so much here for fans of Led Zeppelin to treasure and for the first time since Bonzo's untimely death prematurely ended the group's existence I feel like I am once again listening to the greatest rock `n' roll band in the world.  It is like \\"Coda\\" never came out.  If you are a Led Zeppelin fan you simply have to have this one, even if that means you have to go and buy a DVD player to enjoy it.

B00005JKC3|4.0|...it's actual quite good.<br />     I've never been a big fan of the Hulk - I've always been a Batman fan myself - so it didn't thrill me to learn that this angry green behemoth would be getting his own live-action movie. In fact, I was even a little put off when news got out that the Hulk would be completely CGI, instead of Lou Ferrigno, or some other big muscled man playing this jolly-green giant. So the Hulk really wasn't on my top most wanted list of films to see this summer. But a situation emerged where I found myself in need of a movie to go see with some friends. Well, not much was out that week, so I chose `Hulk.<br />     My first impression was: this is a dark movie. Even darker then my favorite superhero film - Batman. I realized it also featured a extremely psychological, complicated plot. I knew instantly this would not go over well with the general public. This is a film where you actual have to think. A lot of people despise that.<BR>But for me, someone who is inclined to that time of film, I enjoyed it, even though it might have been a little drawn out.<br />     The film, of course, centers around Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a nuclear mishap, and a mad-scientist father (Nick Nolte). Through the movie, we are showed flash backs of Bruce's forgotten childhood, revelations about his family, and other various elements that spell out Bruce's emotional state. This film is not about the hulk, it's about Bruce, his father and their struggles with troubled pasts. Bruce's ex-girlfriend/co-worker Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is also intertwined into that past.<br />     That facet of the film I liked. What I didn't like about the film was...quite frankly...the Hulk. The creature really only served as a side story in the film; making only a few appearances. Two of which were nothing more then long, overdrawn, boring, and irrational fight scenes. The worst element of the film was the star, really. Director Ang Lee did a much better job with the drama plot rather then the action one.<br />     This is where the movie probably fails. Ang Lee didn't make a action movie, he really even didn't make a superhero movie. Instead, Director Lee made a psychological drama with bits of bad action sequences thrown in. But then, isn't that what the Hulk is about; psychology rather then action. The idea of the Hulk is what makes this movie a true conundrum. The Hulk is a superhero, right? But the character is more about the inner workings of a human being, not a caped crusader who goes around saving innocents. Really, if you ask me, Mr. Lee was caught between a rock and a hard place in making this movie. The Hulk is not a action star, he's a tortured soul. People must understand that before seeing this film. IT IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE. DON'T TAKE THE FIVE-YEAR-OLDS, THEY'LL BE BORED STIFF.<br />     But all that aside, if you watch the Hulk with the mindset that it is not a action movie. It'll will probably be an enjoyable event for you. If you think of it as Spider-Man 2, you'll probably be disappointed beyond compare.

B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers was an awesome new age horror movie, it was the best idea hollywood had for a horror movie in a long time. The main reason being it introduced us to a new horror icon. First their was Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Movies, then it was Jason From Friday the 13th movies, then it was Freddy from the Nightmare movies, then the Scream Ghost from the Scream Movies, and now it's \\"The Creeper\\" From Jeepers Creepers. The movie is about how two siblings are taking a cross country drive in a remote area with miles and mlies of flat plane's when they see a guy on the side of the road putting a body bag into a huge drian pipe, so when the two kids think he left one of them go down the huge pipe to see what he put down there, well it was full of dead bodies, so terrified he quickly gets out of there, they both get back into the car but \\"The Creeper\\" saw everything and now that the two kids saw hid domain he will stop at nothing to silence them...for good
B000002J1Y|5.0|This album represents the loud raw energy of 1972 Yes. Some of these tunes stomp their studio counterparts (&quot;Siberian khatru&quot;, &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;), certain others seem better on the studio renditions- &quot;Close to the edge&quot; is a bit too complex and nuanced to make this version better than the studio one. A lot of people have mentioned a dislike for the &quot;remastered sound&quot; on this cd, perhaps without knowing the original quality of the recordings. While the playing on this album is incredible, the sound is not. &quot;Remastering&quot; can not completely fix a less than stellar recording. Notwithstanding that, I was still not happy with the job Joe Gastwirt did on this release, especially considering the great sound of the YES YEARS box set, which he worked on a few years earlier. My main complaint is Steve Howe's guitar parts seem to be turned down in the mix- Gastwirt seems to have cranked up the bass and lower midrange, and reduced the upper midrange and treble- while this serves Squire's bass well, it is not a good thing for Howe's guitar. Overall this is not a significant improvement over previous issues- vinyl or cd. The performances deserved better recording quality to start with though- there are plenty of live albums from around the same period with way better sound quality than Yessongs. I hope Yes has more smoking stuff like this from around the same period in the vaults with better sound, because this was about their prime as far as the energy of their performances (72-79). In spite of its sonic shortcomings, this is still one of my favorite live albums. True fans will no doubt own this- newcomers be aware of the sound caveat and that these performances are not for the timid. If you want more recent classic Yes performances that are excellent, refined and well recorded, get &quot;Keys to ascension&quot;...and go to see them when they come to your town, they are still great.

0345423496|5.0|This was my first Arthur C. Clarke novel. Like a lot of people I've seen the Kubrick movie several times and I've known _of_ Clarke, but I had never read any of Clarke's novels. Though this is the last book in a trilogy, I had no trouble getting into the story.<br />A body is found floating out in space, and when a space tug Goliath hauls it in we find it is Frank Poole, who has been presumed dead or missing for 1000 years. Due to the deep freeze of space, Poole is able to be revived and is amazed to discover 1000 years has passed. All the people he knows are dead, the life that he knew is long since gone, but curiously he is the subject of much attention, as he is a historical curiosity. People want to meet him and talk with him, and he becomes a kind of a celebrity.<br />Part of the fun of the novel comes with Clarke's showing how a person suddenly tranferred 1000 years into the future would have to deal with all the changes that have happened to society, and Clarke's wit and charm shine very brightly in a lot of these instances. My favorite of the changes was the Five Towers that have been erected over every continent on Earth that act as a sort of giant elevator from ground level up into space. This was a very vivid image and Clarke seemed to have fun with it. Conversely, I thought the Dragon Scene was a little off course. It just didn't make sense in the natural progression of a realistically-told sci-fi novel to introduce a woman flying on the back of a dragon, even if it turns out to be a technological device.<br />But Clarke recovers nicely and moves his plot moves on to more recognizable things like the Europa monolith, Hal, and the voice of Poole's old shipmate Dave Bowman. Poole acts a messenger sent to communicate with the monolith which has integrated Dave Bowman into itself. We learn more about the monolith, its origins and its purpose, and the novel builds to an exciting ending wherein the course of human evolution may be altered forever.<br />3001: The Final Odyssey was great fun to read. It is a story by a master of the genre. I do see how that if you are a regular sci-fi reader, this novel might be a bit slow for you, and a number of other customer reviews have touched on that. Clarke seems to be writing science fiction for a mainstream audience. But if you're just looking for a well-written, fun read to spend a few hours away from the hum-drum world we all have to live in 3001: The Final Odyssey is a great place to begin.<br />Sincerely yours,<br />StaceyThe Final Odyssey was great fun to read.

B00009MGQL|4.0|Jeff Beck's CDs are among the few that I will buy on the spot without hearing a single note--and I've yet to be disappointed over his past four or five releases. The new CD has some great tracks on it, interesting synth stuff made unique through his fantastic style. Yeah, the vocal samples are a bit annoying in places, but that's a style that's been on the past few albums too, so it's not really a surprise. The only wish I have is for a few more traditional songs with normal vocals, etc. But I'm digging this.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I've personally always been a fan of Daredevil comic book wise and when I heard Ben Affleck would be Matt Murdock, I had reservations. then the rest of the cast came out, Jennifer Gardner I was like who? Colin Farrel as Bullseye? I can kinda see it but with the bald head?? Michael Clarke Duncan??? get real. When I saw this movie in the theatres I was blown away. EVERY actor in it portrays the character perfectly if not even more so. The story, acting, and action, heck all of it, is spectacular. I was over-joyed and I think even if you aren't a Devil fan you should buy this.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|This soundtrack is delightful. Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer worked hard to make the music complement the movie while allowing it to also stand independantly, and their hard work can be heard in each note. The tracks flow seamlessly together, carrying the music like one would expect a sea voyage to be: whimsical at first, while gaining an undercurrent of intensity, which then rises to the surface.<br /> However, this soundtrack does seem quite short, partly because it is. At 43 minutes and 41 seconds, some of the original score has remained off of the album, but the most prominent and influential songs are present. Mainly what was left behind was filler music that played so softly that most wouldn't notice. And perhaps another reason for the seemingly short playtime is a carry-over of the movie's cinematic touch. The soundtrack, like the film, is so enjoyable that it seems to be shorter than it really is. Once again, this has much to do with Badelt and Zimmer's musical excellence.<br /> This soundtrack packs quite a punch with the tracks from the action scenes, but also maintains the movie's lightheartedness. It's duality brings out it's charm, and I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend it to almost anyone.
B00005JLWN|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I thought it sounded cool, nothing special. I rented the movie and then immediately had to buy it. Stand out performances by Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Taye Diggs, not to mention stand out fight sequences and a plot that ANYONE could go along with. It really is a movie that has to deal with the base nature of human beaings: our emotions. The story is captivating and the emotional content is almost over-whelming. I highly recomend just buying this movie because it has a lot of value when it comes to watching over and over again.
B000068FUM|5.0|I came to the Jayhawks the wrong way round via Rainy Day Music but having already a working knowledge of Burrito Bros, Gram Parsons I was astounded to hear how the early Jayhawks with Mark Olsen are the aural spitting image of Gram Parsons but tighter and with a better ear for melody.  The vocals are not overproduced like Eagles harmonies but a great natural live sound.  Track 7 Bad Time is as finer pop tune as you would find anywhere.  The lyrics shift from endearing to whimsy in the flash of an eye and are driven along by some great guitar work.    (particularly 12 string) Miss Williams Guitar and Ten Little Kids are real fun almost bluegrass and Blue is another driven country rock tune.  Every track is a winner and the Jayhawks are a knockout
B00008EY9G|5.0|I've seen my fair share and then some of the thriller who dunnits and what not but this movie shocked me! I loved it. I've always been a big fan of Cusack and Liota, not to mention Amanda Peet is gorgeous but this movie keeps you guessing and creeps you out at the same time. Wonderfully done with terrific filming. I recomend buying, not renting this movie because you have to watch it a few times to pick up on everything going on.

B0000039PW|4.0|Biggie Smalls was such a talented rapper. Considered to be my 2nd favorite rapper of all time (2pac being my first, of course), Biggie Smalls really did shine out on this CD. Many people reckon 'LIFE AFTER DEATH' was the CD Biggie Smalls put the most work into but this is his best CD by a mile. The reason for this was because each and every song was perfectly made, perfectly thought about and made perfect sense. His meanings in these songs are mind-blowing and the way he passed it out to the world was even more amazing. Songs like JUICY, BIG POPPA, RESPECT AND THINGS DONE CHANGED really stood out on this album, possibly because of the way Biggie Smalls used it. JUICY is by far the track's most favorite song and kind of takes us back to the old days. It was really disappointing to see that he turned his back on 2Pac back in '94 after that shootout because I reckon 2Pac and Biggie Smalls would have been the most unstoppable Rap Team ever to be created and the most tighest collaboration, so tight that no other rappers would beat them.<br />Before he started to witness his downfall, before he and Puffy become real close friends, he made this album. Witness the true strength of The Notorious B.I.G on this album, you cannot hate on this album.

For anybody that has studyed in any voice or chorus class, you can really appreciate the resonance in her voice. And if I read one more review saying that they sound like linkin park, i'll scream. I'll admit that Bring me to life has similarity to them in certain aspects, but that's about it. Obviously you haven't listened to the whole CD. The emotion behind the lyrics is so evident, and true musicians can appreciate the instrumental aspects of the album.

This is a hilarious, almost too wierd to be true dive into modern baseball with a focus on Billy Beane, a new kind of general manager and outrageous character. It's about a lot more than baseball and is for anyone interested in how people think outside the box and revolutionize a sport, or business, or anything. Lewis has improved his stuff since Liars Poker and I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants. Great stuff!
B00006HBUB|1.0|As a kid I loved the Scooby-Doo cartoons.  Lots of good, clean, goofy, spooky fun.  Unfortunately, the live-action version lost a LOT in the translation.  The main problem is that it's not funny.  Not even close.  My wife and I kept asking each other, &quot;Was that supposed to be funny?&quot;  even though we knew the answer...No.  The plodding plot exists to allow the cardboard characters to go through their paces and to give the animators a chance to create the bumbling, larger-than-life Scooby-Doo.  But this movie chases its tail, unsure what kind of beast it is:  a mindless spoof, a monster flick, or a genuine mystery.  Ultimately, and unfortunately, it settles on being an undesignated mess.  Best advice to potential viewers:  Scooby-Don't.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera decided to leave behind the teen-poppy tunes that gave her so much success and became her in a super-star, so I gotta give her real credit for takin' that big risk in her carrer. So, in this album, we get to know the real Christina, the songwriter and artist we knew was gonna appear and It's truly interesting. Using her extraordinary, multi-octave and soulful vocie, Xtina brings a wide range of styles: rock, pop, r&b, soul, jazz, gospel, hip hop, latin and funk, and opens her heart on the lyrics, much more mature and deep. <BR>If she keeps on spreading her talent and voice this way, be sure there's not going to be any Madonna, Mariah O Whitney left!
B000000W5L|5.0|I grew up with Sticky Fingers and Hot Rocks, and the odd collection of Stones tracks. I picked up this CD no less than 5 times in stores, reading the song titles and deducing that the only song worth owning it for was Tumbling Dice. Well, for whatever reason, all the praise for this album finally rubbed off on me and I bought it. <BR>I admit that I didn't get it at first. 'Exile' isn't a skip-around CD -- you can't go from track 2 to track 14 back to track 3 and get the idea of what the band was up to; not immediately anyway. You have to listen to this baby from beginning to end, time and again, picking out new favorites each time. Only then can you pick up what the genius of this sound, of their playing, of their vision and the overall tribute to the music they love. It's quite excellent and for certain a way to gauge the catalog of anyone who calls themself a &quot;music fan&quot; -- i.e., no Exile, no taste! Blocking out Mick (never easy as he is quite good at his job) and listening to what Keith and the boys do -- how they weave and build, how loose they keep it -- is my standard for great music.<BR>Oh, and the clown who recommended Janet Jackson's Velvet Rope over this -- I don't think you get it to begin with, so insert and play again!
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Good movie.  Recommended.  But could someone involved with it please give some guarantee that there will be no \\"X-Men 2.5?\\"  Please.  Before I blow my limited funds.  Please.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This CD has been playing continuously since I purchased it.  I have seen the movie 6 times now and 3 of those times were simply to listen for the music while watching the movie.  I have become addicted to this soundtrack.

B00009P1O5|5.0|I recorded this album from vinyl onto audio cassette long ago (12/81?). Now the tape's about worn out. I've searched in vain for YEARS trying to find this album on CD.<br />Now, finally HERE IT IS!!!<br />You'll dance in your chair all through this album! Every song's a winner! A driving beat, great percussion, wailing lead guitar. This is a &quot;take-no-prisoner's&quot; album, one you'll need if you're ever stranded on a desert island.<br />A DEFINITE MUST HAVE!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|While any other series would more than likely lack any real substance or storyline in it's middle section (there being no beginning or end) this second installment of the &quot;LOTR&quot; trilogy actually manages to advance the story and one-up part 1. The true souls of this movie are Frodo and Aragorn who continue to deepen as characters and show streaks of heroism that seem to surprise everyone around them, including themselves. My favorite sequence so far has to be the late night conversation Gollum has with his evil and good sides, his movements, facial expressions and creepy voice are an astounding feat of computer animation, you truly feel like Gollum is a real person. For a 3 hour film, &quot;...The Two Towers&quot; moves at a very brisk pace and never bores, even during the more sudued scenes. This is a terrific continuation and that leaves me eager to see just how good &quot;Return Of The King&quot; will be.
0425152251|1.0|SOPHIE'S WORLD is Josten Gaardner's bold attempt to get the paperback-reading public to become acquainted with the history of philosophy and to ask the big questions of all time. However, the novel is not a very successful book.<br />As the novel opens it acquaints us with Sophie Admunsen, a Norwegian teenager who will soon celebrate her 15th birthday. She begins to receive letters from a mysterious man named Alberto Knox, who leads her through the history of philosophy from the Pre-Socratics to the modern day. Just over halfway through the novel Gaardner tries to shake things up with some drastic plot twists. But all of this has been done before. A large amount of the latter half of the book seems derivative of Michael Ende's children's classic THE NEVERENDING STORY. Towards the end of the book Gaardner then seems to realise that having spent time on so much plot he will have to greatly speed up the discussion of philosophy. Hundreds of pages consist of a monologue by Alberto, with Sophie throwing in single-line interjections: &quot;I understand,&quot; &quot;Right,&quot; &quot;I would suppose so!&quot;<br />Even as a philosophical tutorial, SOPHIE'S WORLD isn't especially helpful. His coverage of Spinoza is superficial. Most disappointing is the coverage of 20th century philosophy, in which important figures like Focault and Heidegger are missing.<br />I was also disappointed by the translation. Paulette Moller apparently has little knowledge of history because she makes several little mistakes (&quot;Judea&quot; for &quot;Judah&quot; for example). This caused me to doubt the reliability of the English rendering.<br />While perhaps a successful hybrid of a textbook and a novel could be written, SOPHIE'S WORLD is not it. If you are interested in philosophy, I'd recommend getting a simple textbook for beginners.
B00006RJHG|5.0|Black Christmas is without a doubt the greatest horror film you've probably never seen. I hadn't heard anything about it myself until I noticed it cropping up on a lot of people's favourite horror film lists, so decided it was about time I saw what all the fuss was about. The film centres around a Sorority house in the Christmas holiday season, where the girls begin receiving a series of disturbing phone calls from an unknown source. It soon becomes apparent that a faceless killer is stalking them, a killer who has snuck in through an open window and is inhabiting their attic... Pre-dating all of the classic horror films of the late 70s and 80s, Black Christmas is a stark, stylish and creepy film that boasts some chilling moments and some great performances. The genius of the film lies in it's ability to evoke an intense atmosphere of forboding which leaves you constantly unsettled and totally immersed which it does without the need for special effects, gore, or cheap scares. The direction, framing, POV shots, and lighting all work toegther seemlessly to provide moments that really leave you cold (especially the eye through the crack of the door). The script deserves a mention too, because it really is superb. There are some great characters, some good threads of drama and even comedy, but these are brilliantly and appropriately contained within their scenes without detracting from the menacing atmosphere and overall theme of the film. The phone calls are one of the high points, containing shades of Reagan's multi-voice outbursts in the Exorcist but with overtones of despair and confusion which give an insight into the psychological state of the deranged killer. All in all, if you are a fan of horror, and looking for something more than the slick disposable dime a dozen slasher films of recent years, you simply have to own this little gem.
B00005JLSE|3.0|Musicals have been undergoing a resurgence and when &quot;Chicago&quot; hit the big screen, critics and musical fans alike went gaga. Well the fanfare's died down a bit and it's time to take a look at the good and bad about the cinematic version of &quot;Chicago&quot;.<br />First of all, after having seen the DVD's deleted scene I am more convinced than ever that the exclusion of the Zeta-Jones/Latifah duet &quot;Class&quot; was a glaring mistake.  This highly sarcastic and visceral song was for me the highlight of the Broadway musical and to have taken it out took out some of my joy upon viewing. I equate this to making an ironic omelet and leaving out the satire.<br />Great job by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifah, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger.  It is a great movie - but as far as greatest musicals of all time, come on.  Busby Berkeley is, has been and will always be the cappo di tutto cappos of musicals.
B0000073NC|5.0|Well .. fans who fell in love with the Scorpions when &quot;Love at First Sting&quot; was released need to do a little digging and purchase some of their older stuff.  This is the Scorpion's second album and it shows that these guys have &quot;had it&quot; from the beginning!<br />It took a while for the CD to get to me (no longer in distribution in the USA), but it was well worth the wait.  The opening number &quot;Speedy Is Coming&quot; is a good old fashioned rock song -- a great way to open the CD!<br />The other tunes do not disappoint either.  &quot;They Need a Million&quot; is a great 2-part song and the vocals (performed by Rudy) are excellent.  Great guitar harmonies and solid performances by the other band members.<br />I have most of the Scorpions CD's and I love all of their styles.  I find it refreshing that one band can deliver songs that reach so many audiences.  This CD shows the early Scorpions starting out on this path of creativity and it is awesome to hear how well they &quot;gelled&quot; from the start.<br />A strong &quot;thumbs up&quot; to anybody who likes good Rock n' Roll!
B00005JLSE|5.0|A musical satire that pokes fun at and even exposes our need for celebrity and the lengths some people will go to to achieve it. Are the characters likable? Despite myself I found I was drawn to them like a moth to flame. Could I see myself having dinner with Velma Kelly, Roxie Hart, Mama Morton or Billy Flynn? Absolutely not. I'd be afraid they would stab me in the back, but Rob Marshall creates a musical full of bright colors, great turns from the actors &quot;in both worlds,&quot; and provides a mirror into our celebrity obessesed culture that should hopefully have us thinking long after Velma and Roxie take their final bow. Catherine Zeta-Jones is fiery, funny and wonderful as Velma. I found myself waiting until she was back on screen. 'All That Jazz,' 'Cell Block Tango,' and 'I Can't Do It Alone' showcase her dancing legs and singing chops. Queen Latifah's 'When Your Good To Mama' was another highlight for me. Get the DVD to view the great song 'Class' with CZJ and QL. Its worth the price. Viva les musicials!
0688163173|2.0|Another ridiculous story by an over-rated writer.  The audio version is read by David Strathairn who swallows one third of every sentence, so be prepared to turn your volume on HIGH.  Who is friend in this story, who is foe?  Who cares!!!
6305784116|5.0|If my daughter shows to the TV and says &quot;miau miau&quot; we know she wants to see Aristocats - maybe 3 to 5 times a week. The film is lovely made, has its own drawing stile, a little bit different than other Disneys, the drawing is a little bit more artistic and pencil like. Its fun, its music, its a good but simple story.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|My criticism is not with the musical composition but with the quality of the CD.  I bought two copies of this soundtrack and found them both to be defective. I tried contacting Disney Records to inform them of the defect but they have not responded.  I tried both CDs on 4 different playback devices and the problem was consistent on all four.  It isn't more evident than on track number 5. Swords Crossed. Towards the middle of the track, the distortion is unmistakable.  If you are thinking of purchasing this soundtrack, check track number five first.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|An excellent movie that holds up well even after all these years. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and never get tired of it-won't collect dust on the shelf.<br />Having said that, the opening 10 minutes of the DVD sucked butt. The previews are highly annoying and you can't skip past them.  Studio's need to STOP DOING THIS to the buying public.<br />The extra's are so-so, the mockumentary being the best part of the package besides the movie.
B000069HJM|4.0|The problem with Supertramp is, not everyone &quot;gets it&quot; the first time. I didn't dig this record right off, and I'm a rabid Tramppist. And, the title track came off a lot better in the two live records that followed. Still, the rest of the record is very danceable and compares well to Oingo Boingo and Orchestral Manouevres In The Dark. If you want some &quot;new&quot; Supertramp, give this a try. It's really excellent.
B00005JLSE|3.0|Chicago is the story of a young woman (Renee Zellweger)who kills her lover (she is married) and seems doomed to die on Murderer's Row. While in the slammer, she hears about and eventually gets a lawyer (Richard Gere)to help her get out.  The lawyer is famous for freeing guilty women who have walked in her shoes before.<br />As musicals go, it's just ok.  I can't believe it got all the hype it received including best picture.  The characters are all interesting, especially Queen Latifah, who makes the most of a small role.  Gere and Zellweger are their usual passable selves, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, as another convicted killer looking for a way out also does things pretty well.<br />The problem is, that when musicals insist on making everything musical, it gets in the way.  I swear, not one important point is spoken in this film, it's all sung.  That gets on my nerves.  Since the performances are good, not great and the story is average at best, this film would appeal to only real musical fans, or fans of the performers.  Since I fall into neither category, it was average for me.
B00004R7TP|5.0|This CD contains the best music I have ever heard in my life. Haunting, yet beautiful. It still sounds fresh and new, except for the Linn drum machine. I don't understand how someone can create music this good.
0385504209|5.0|I'm the type that usually eschews 'Best Seller List' books. Mainly because I find that the books that make it have to do with name recognition and politics. However, I decided to try this book and haven't stopped talking about it. It took me over two hours to read and there were times I had to force myself to put it down to get my breath. It's one of the best books I've ever read. Literally. Also, when you're done, make sure you go to the [...] and play the online code breaking game. Talk about original and fun! It's also free! Can't beat that OR this book. It's worth every dime.
B00003CXTG|1.0|OK, as a histery major at a MAJOR american university, I'll tell you right off the bat this film had some serious problems with its histery - where was the Titantic? Doesn't Bay know it was sunk at Pearl Harbor along with the Battleship Lusitania? And what was with that Dr. Doolittle raid? Dr. Doolittle was a Canadian zookeeper, not a bomber pilot. And it wasn't an air raid that devastated Vietnam after Pearl Harbor, it was Texas-sized planet killer asteroids dropped from stealth planes. Didn't Bay see \\"Final Countdown\\"? And when did Ben Affleck become, like, a fighter pilot? They could at least have given him a jet plane, or used Tom Cruise, who is a real jet pilot. Other than these ridiculous hitorical innaccurasies, it was a great summer blockbuster film! The sizzling chemistry between the two pilots was amazing and heartwarming. Cuba Gooding was fantastic as the black sailor, OMG OMG OMG I didn't even know they had black people back then (and I'm not alone on that one ask any white person)! I watched this with my grandmother and she agreed there weren't any black peeple at the time too, so this film is HIGHLY progressive too.<br /><br />=== SPOILER ALERT ===<br /><br />Basically it was about like, these totally cool people, like Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and all these geeks, who were like, foreign or something and totaly evil dorks who can't even speak english. Then the cool people like totally kick the their geek Vietnamese butts. We'll be renting this film for decades to come.Sure it wasn't highbrow, but that isn't what films are for. If you want highbrow just watch Fox News like every other AMERICAN.
0553573403|5.0|I would actually give this book 4.5 stars but rounded up. The writing is wonderful. I've rarely seen as well developed and thought out characters in any literature, let alone fantasy. His style of writing is phenomenal and doesn't bore you to death with descriptions like Jordan or meaningless hundreds of pages. Every chapter has action and a climax. Every word is meaningful. The only knock I have is lack of fantasy elements. No magic and very few fantasy/mythical creatures for an 800 page novel. This book is more a medieval mystery/intrigue. Every character has his own UNIQUE personality and even a different way to think. The bad guys aren't cliche black and white. The action continues with every chapter. What more can I say other than this is not just fantasy drivel but serious literary text.
B00005OAIE|5.0|... toss in Duncan Sheik for soft sensitivity, Dave Matthews for pure, fearless ambience, and you have reasonably something close to John Mayer... but he is very much his own guy. A couple of my friends have been telling me for months to check him out... and, paranoid me, thinking he would be a potential boy-band swooner with a guitar, I didn't give him a chance until I saw him perform at the Grammys. And now, I've all but worn out this disc. Every song is nothing short of amazing... all simple yet pensive, and incredibly easy to listen to. I can't wait to hear more from this guy!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Well..I am a HUGE Matrix fan for its action while giving those with a bit more intellectual ability something to chew on. My favorite and most unique theory I've heard thus far is the following:<br />The humans actually beat the machines and to keep them at bay, the human created the Matrix for the Machines. So, Neo, Trinity, every other person is actually an AI hooked up to the Matrix. Now, I haven't even thought about how this is possible or if there are clues in the movie to support this, but it sure would be an interesting, Sixth Sense, type of twist. I'll need to go back and watch the Matrix and wait for Reloaded to come out on DVD to see if this theory holds any water. <br />The multiple matrix theory is getting tiring. I think it does hold water and may be the best theory, but I'd be a bit disappointed. It would seem like a copout. Of course, this is my personal theory:<br />The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith is on screen. The fight is amazing. The special effects are like nothing ever seen. Then, as Neo is about to die....We see Mr. Anderson asleep at his desk in his cube. He jerks awake and says, \\"Whoa!\\" Then a FedEx guy come up behind him and says, \\"Thomas Anderson?\\" Cut to black...Rage Against the Machine Music....
B00005JKZT|5.0|For those of you who read my reviews on a regular basis, you may remember last years review of \\"The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring\\". You may also know that even though I saw the film in the theatre, I wanted for the DVD release so I could reveiw both the movie and discuss the DVD special features.<br />An even better film then the first, \\"The Two Towers\\" begins where the first movie left off. Hobbits Frodo and Sam have left the Fellowship of went off to destroy The Ring of Power in the evil land of Mordor on their own. Met by a pervious owner of the ring, Smeagel, stuck with the evil Gollum, Frodo and Sam make him lead them to Mordor and the enterance known as the Black Gates. <br />The second group of the broken Fellowship has been captured by a group of Orcs, creatures hunting to retrieve the Ring of Power and give to the good turned bad wizard Saurmen the White, working for Lord Sauren. Merry and Pippin, both hobbits, escape from the Orcs during battle and meet Treebeard, a giant talking tree who befriends them and leads them to the other trees to figure out what to do with the two hobbits.<br />The third and second most important group of the Fellowship, head to the grand gates of King Theoden. Theoden has been possessed by his evil second Wormtouge who is in league with Saurmen. After saving the king and banishing Wormtouge from the kingdom, they head to Helm's Deep to prepare for battle with the Orc army. <br />Fans of \\"The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring\\" will not be disappointed with part two. Whoever thought that the first movie ended too fast and wanted more will be angry. Part two ends with a more dire cliffhanger where someone is led into danger. More engaging and entertaining then the first, it also has become a DVD that you can't miss.<br />This lavish 2 disc set has the actual two towers on the discs. Saurmen's tower on disc one with Saurens tower on disc two. Disc one is the movie in Dolby Digital with no specials. Disc twois complety special features and special they are.<br />The in depth programs on this version are On the Set:The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers and Return to Middle-earth. Very infomative and interesting these programs gave me more infomation on the background of the film. There are also eight making of featurette's created for [...] Not as many as on the first DVD they are still interesting.Trailers and television commericals are a small part of the video along with Emilliano Torrini's \\"Gollum's Song\\" music video. <br />The spotlight are the three special sneak peeks. The first is an inside look at the extended edition version of this movie. Forty extra minutes are included already in the movie with a new musical score by Howard Shore. There is also a peek at the new video game \\"The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King\\" leading into the final peek. A ten minute preview of \\"The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King\\" which is the third installment in the seris.<br />To sum it up \\"The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers\\" is on my list of one of the greatest movies ever made. So those of you looking for it in the stores, just find the maroon colored sides in fullscreen or widescreen versions of the movie. I am looking forward to the third and final installment in the seris this December. Lord of the Rings's fans who read my review of the first movie and now this, I'll see you in a year for my review of the movie and the DVD of \\"The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King.\\"<br />ENJOY!<br />Rated PG-13 for Epic Battle Sequences and Some Scary Images.
B00000AOUD|5.0|For Tull fans this is a must-have CD.  I had the vinyl version way back when I had a pony tail and used to inhale.  It was great then and it's great now, especially with headphones.  I won't get into reviewing the musical content other than to say that it is largely unlike other Tull recordings of any period.  Passion Play has the same format but is preachy and overwrought.  There are some other great reviews here of the music on the CD - use your arrow keys.<br />The audio rework sounds to my ears just about as good as any modern CD, so that makes it a huge success in that the original tapes were 30+ years old.  The acoustic guitar work is crystalline clear, with good imaging.  A job well done.<br />The live version (track 3) is interesting enough but I doubt that I'll listen to it all that often because the &quot;audience participation&quot; level is too high, a classic woe of live music recordings by many artists (Metheny excepted).<br />Be sure to pop out the CD after the live version is over.  Otherwise you'll be subjected to the band interview.  The members of the group sound like a bunch of grandmas griping about the horrible traffic jams these days and oh my how their arthritus is acting up.  Rock stars should shut up and play their guitars, as FZ so eloquently opined.  Boca cerrada, no entran moscas.
B00008H2LB|5.0|First thing I can say is: wow! A lot of people think that Meteora is just a spin-off of Hybrid Theory, but you can tell that's not true. Mike's rapping is a lot better, for example.<BR>My opinion:<br />1. Foreword-nothing to say about it...<BR>2. Don't say-8/10<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong-10/10 <BR>4. Lying from You-7/10<BR>5.

Looking forward to more from Linkin Park!
B00006M183|2.0|Pearl Jam really need to put their riot back into their act.  Their quality of output since hiring Matt Cameron on the drums has been abismal; it's a nice idea to introduce a more democratic structure to the band, giving the other band members the chance to write songs, but unfortunately the songs, particularly by Matt Cameron are terrible.  The real song writing talent in the band has always been the Vedder/Gossard partnership.  The cryptic and difficult songs that scatter this album really overshadow the few good songs (I am Mine, Save you).  Pearl Jam were right on the money when they released their best album Yield, but since then they have failed to get the adronaline rushing.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I'm giving it a five purely because of the film.  I don't want to jump the gun and sing Holy Hosana on an unseen remastered special edition,  but I can't wait to see this.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|...I will say these words from Al Pacino's favorite movie if the geniuses who transfer the anormorphic print to a better quality DVD picture, (the DVD now in hand is wanting),and the DTS sound can come through as well..THEN I will say,\\"NOW YOU'RE TALKING to me BABY..!!\\"
B000002H72|4.0|The Pixies successfully combine stop-start rythms with an addictive chorus to make some of the best and most revolutionary rock of recent times. My girlfried likes them. The lyrics are odd and very cryptic at times. Frank Black makes use of the very little singing voice he has. His frequent wailing and screaming often intensfy the impact of the lyrics. Anyways, in conclusion this is a very good album worthy of the underground praise it receives!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Peter Jackson truly brought the second instalment to the next level; and not just with more characters and bigger and more jaw dropping special effects and battle scenes. The characters have been developed into ones that the audience truly cares about and roots for. Keep in mind that the third instalment and conclusion to the trilogy \\"the return of the king\\" i am almost certain WILL blow the forst two out of the water; but we will just have to wait until december 17 to be sure
B0000AOV85|4.0|How could you have seen the Dark Side tour in 69-70 when the album didn't come out until 73.
B00005JLPK|4.0|A vivid and sensual portrayal of the Frida's life in Mexico which makes this quite an absorbing, if not transcending movie. <br />The story is well balanced, starting from her teens and then her direct encounter and then her relationship with Rivera till her death.  We see much of Rivera, so much so that an alternative title to this film might as well read &quot; Diego Rivera&quot;! This is not altogether an adverse comment, for Rivera's part was so successful. But there is definitely too much of Trotsky. What is the point of all the details of the assisination of Trotsky anyway! A mere digression. <br />Somehow, one's aware that these events aren't exactly seen through Frida's eyes, nothing like her inner voice nor the stream of her own consciousness or anything of that sort.  One would rather see more of Frida's paintings and how she actually painted, or else her ideas of painting. The actual physcial pain that poisoned her happiness, or the pain so strikingly reflected in her paintings aren't sufficiently conveyed to the viewers. I'm afraid serious and curious viewers alike have to look else where for these things. <br />In short, this is more a biography than an autobiography, and the wrong choice of viewpoint takes one star away.
B00009V93Z|4.0|Another year, another Elvis box set.  Unlike last year's box, which tried to give an overview of Elvis' entire career, this one concentrates on four distinct aspects of the King's career.<br /><br />Disc one contains binaural (two-track) recordings from the '50s.  These are great performances, you can't go wrong with Elvis in the '50s.  Of course, most of these performances have been released before, but it is interesting to hear them in stereo, albeit primative stereo.<br /><br />Disc two contains alternate takes of songs from his first four post-Army films.  A lot of negative things have been said about Elvis' soundtrack recordings, and rightly so.  However, the soundtracks for these four films weren't that bad (the worst was yet to come).  Sure, there were some corny songs like \\"Big Boots\\" and \\"Slicin' Sand\\", but at least Elvis seemed to be having fun.  These tracks are a lot of fun to hear.<br /><br />Disc three contains alternate takes of songs recorded in Nashville in the 1960s.  To my mind, Elvis' '60s Nashville recordings are perhaps his most underrated recordings.  Here we have alternate versions of great hits like \\"Surrender\\", \\"His Latest Flame\\" and \\"U.S. Male\\", some of his classic gospel songs, and great album tracks like \\"The Girl of My Best Friend\\" and \\"Night Rider\\".  This disc is a treat from start to finish.<br /><br />Disc four features a complete concert from 1972.  This was recorded for the feature film [[ASIN:6304479689 Elvis on Tour]].  Elvis seems to be in pretty good spirits on this night.  At least he doesn't sound as bored as he did at the [[ASIN:B000002WFK Madison Square Garden concert]] from around the same time.  Elvis concerts tended to have a sameness to them, and this one doesn't have very many surprises to it, other than his then current single \\"Until It's Time For You To Go\\" and an early version of the yet to be released \\"Burning Love\\".  This is probably the most uninteresting disc in the box.<br /><br />Overall, how much you like this box set depends on how much you like Elvis.  If you can't get enough of him (like me), you should get it.  If you are just a casual fan of the King, this isn't a vital purchase.lvis.  If you can't get enough of him (like me), you should get it.  If you are just a casual fan of the King, this isn't a vital purchase.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This was the first Dire Straits album I heard, more than 20 years ago - and it still gives me goosebumps today. Despite the fact that it only has a few songs, it is all class - anarchic social commentary, insightful story, whimsical, lyrical ballad... all set amidst a deep texture of subtle instrumental colours. <br />'Telegraph Road' is perhaps the most interesting 20+ minute song to make it onto the charts. If you shut your eyes, you can &quot;see&quot; the town around it being constructed in rapid retrospect, and it's easy to sense the ensuing loneliness of being cooped up in an urban sprawl. <br />'Private Investigations' is a reflection of the activities of the urban underworld. However, it is the different timbres created within each section which make it interesting - the best way to listen to this is to put on the headphones and turn up the volume. Mark Knopfler's effortless acoustic guitar playing is a real gem, and the conversations with the vibraphone are particularly effective. <br />'It Never Rains' is a truly wonderful out-take. It begins all innocent and smurf-theme-like, but builds up as the resentment in the lyrics takes over, to the point where the growling electric guitar spits venom at the end. <br />Self-righteous, judgemental, sarcastic, intolerant of fools - this album speaks savagely of a time when power-dressing, huge shoulder pads, too much hair and over-the-top make-up were the fashion statements, and clawing your way to the top was the predominant occupation. Hence it is still a timely voice today!
B00005JKZU|4.0|Have the well thumbed books on my shelf.  Learned a long time ago that my imagination was better than any cinematographer/director/producer so I no longer expect the author's take (which is merely MY interpretation of the author's view) when consuming someone else's vision of it.<br />That said, get a life. We each have our own interpretation of what we ingest. If you don't like the interpretation, don't pour your money into the coffer that will continue to offend you for it will only come back to condemn your vision further.
B0000028M7|5.0|If you are debating on whether or not to buy this, go buy it. It's as simple as that. Heres my review for all of you doubting thomases. <br />Alice in Chains hit their stride so to speak with this album. Layne staley's vocals are at the peak of their intensity and this is the best songwriting of any AiC release. Jerry Cantrell reached the grindy guitar sound that defined AiC's music. Mark Inez goes crazy on the bass, laying the foundations for the eerie lyrics that litter this disc. And Sean Kinney as always is the glue that holds the songs together.<br />If you are looking for most of AiC's heavier hits, you can get most of them on here. &quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;Dam that River&quot;, &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, and &quot;Would?&quot; are all here. These songs are staples on rock, metal, and alternative radio. <br />The haunting melodies are all over this one and the atmosphere is very dark. Lyrically, there are many drug references and Jerry and Layne write about the pains of addiction. Also, &quot;Rooster&quot; has amazing lyrics from Cantrell, depicting the perspective of a depressed Vietnam soldier. <br />Dirt contains my favorite AiC song, Junkhead. AiC has always been able to mix sludge with beauty. This is fully depicted on this song. If you want to get into AiC, listen to this song.<br />Incredible lyrics, sludgy grindy guitars, sick bass, and violent drums, and some of the greatest songwriting ever. The definitive grunge album and the best album of the nineties, rivaled only by In Utero but in my opinion better. This cd has it all and is definetely worth your money. Buy It.
6301066642|3.0|Of all the Marilyn Monroe DVDs I've seen (about 7) this was the only one I didn't take to.  Of course when Marilyn's on the screen, it's great, but the rest of the time I found it to be forced and Ethel Merman just seemed annoying.  The family was dullsville and I never want to see it again!  It wasn't awful, just not worthy of Marilyn.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Terrible. Started out as a great movie and goes completely off the rails in the last 15 minutes or so. Absolutely frustrating. The cast was brilliant - their performances are almost worth having to put up with the abysmal ending... almost.
B00000DCHE|1.0|I picked this up on the advice of a friend who told me that my distaste for Billy Joel was unjustified.  I just hadn't heard his early songs, which were full of raw talent, unspoiled by the demands of keeping on top of the charts.<br />I picked it up, and it is now official: Billy Joel has always been a weak, uninspiring songwriter and performer<br />There is simply nothing interesting about this cd: it contains not a passionate, unique, or inspired note.  Of course, it is, for the most part, not outright offensive.  While certainly no great singer, Billy Joel does not send me running from the room or make me want to immediately shut him off.  His piano playing is certainly no worse than my uncle Joe's, and maybe a little better.  The songs all rhyme, and Billy Joel seems to be very careful to make sure most of them make sense.  <br />Billy Joel's problem is that he always plays it safe, and he is bland, bland, bland.  There is no passion in any of it.  There is no intensity in \\"She's Got a Way\\" (or \\"Just the Way You Are\\" for that matter), just comfortable, predictable, schoolboy rhymes.  \\"Captain Jack\\" is the more boring drug song ever written.  \\"Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway\\" is inane.  Is there an emotional moment in the entire cd?  I couldn't find one.  You can't dance to most of it either.<br />The success of Billy Joel appears to be that he is inoffensive and absolutely deathly dull.  It's comfort music for people who really don't like music.
080017948X|4.0|Imagine someone who is a real self-centered jerk who suddenly gets caught in a time warp that causes him to repeat the same day over and over and over until he gets it right.  That is the fertile scenario that Bill Murray finds himself in when he wakes up repeatedly on Groundhog Day.  The first part of the movie sets the stage as we see Bill as a big-shot big-city weatherman trying to score with the young, attractive assistant producer.  They go to Puxsatawny, PA to cover the annual groundhog event along with their whimsical cameraman.  Things don't go well in his quest for seduction and he is shocked to discover that when he wakes up tommorrow it's yesterday.  There is a great deal of humor that comes from all of this as everybody does everything they did that day except our bewildered weatherman.  In time he discovers some advantages in this merry-go-round.  For example, he arranges to start taking piano lessons.  By the time it's all over, he has become quite the maestro though he has yet to reach tommorrow.  However, his repeated attempts to seduce the assistant producer keep coming up short.  He starts learning some important lessons about himself and others in this repetative day he's stuck in.  Though he improves so much as a person he is still stuck on what's best for him.  The moment he finally does something that's truly selfless, the next day arrives.  <br />I really enjoyed this movie and it is one of those movies that improves with each viewing.  I considered rating it higher but, apart from Bill Murray, the acting wasn't quite that spectacular.  It's a terrific movie for Bill Murray fans and it has a message that should appeal to everyone.
B0000931OG|5.0|I used to like Blur in their britpop days when I was a much younger man, but I grew out of them and left them behind. I listened to british bands that were brilliant in their britishness (there must be something in the water) but didn't nessecarily sound it. Bands like Cold Play and Radiohead. But now with one swing of their mighty 3 nailed paw (now that Coxons gone) they have completely redefined their sound (or undefined their sound may be more accurate). They do a huge amount of experimentation on this album. I can't really compare this album to anyone and that is a very good thing, Blur has finally grown up and found their voice (an inconsistent mad rambling voice). The amount of diversity of influences and combinations on the album are incredible. They use funk, they use tribal, they use electronic, they have a lounge song, they have trance and of course good ol rock and or roll. This is a very international sounding album, its crazy, many of these strange influences are used together; care for some funk tribal trance? O.k. Blur has it. While this album is very diverse and suffers from multiple personality disorder it works. Unfortunetely I don't think a lot of people get this album in N. America. Its a fairly recent album and I find used copies all over the place, some stores have more than one copy. I suppose if you were expecting britpop you might be dissapointed but then people embrace Radiohead with their great experimentations with open arms. Maybe its because this revelation is so new that it has shocked so many people. This isn't an easy album to listen too at first but after continued listenings the album is a fantastic trip of sounds and times and places. Give this album an oportunity!
B000002UAU|5.0|No,not the album,the album is a 5 star classic,the comedy is when some rocket scientist out there gives this 1 or 2 stars...simply hilarious!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Because of the hype surrounding this film at the time of its release, I avoided it and everything associated with it - - hearing \\"Lady Marmalade\\" played over and over caused me to stop listening to the radio that summer.  Still, I added 'Moulin Rouge' to my wish list and received it last Christmas.  Not wanting to appear overly anxious, I'm not quite sure to whom, I waited a few months before I actually viewed it.  I really didn't expect to like it, since I'm not a huge fan of musicals.  <br />Wow.<br />After just a few minutes, I was charmed.  I loosened up.  I recognized the songs.  Songs from my youth were in a musical!  I knew the words!  Honestly, the story is silly, it's a very straightforward, formulaic boy-meets-girl-but-they-can't-be-together-for-whatever-reason story.  But Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are so magnetic together, I found myself enamored with the whole plot-line.  John Leguizamo is fantastic as Toulouse Lautrec.  All the characters are over-the-top.  It's like a freakshow/circus, visually exciting, but kind of weird at the same time.  And if you listen carefully, you'll recognize songs or lyrics from Elton John, the Beatles, Nirvana, David Bowie...it's so much fun!  I would never compare it to classic musicals, such as 'Singin' in the Rain', but Moulin Rouge' will find its place.  I haven't seen 'Chicago' yet, so I can't compare, but for what it is, 'Moulin Rouge' is fun, and satisfies that occasional need for sappiness we women crave once in a while.  Just to hear the line - -  The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return - - it just makes your heart melt!<br />So, if you don't want to think too much, if you don't mind stepping away from reality for a while, if you're willing to partake in a visual and aural feast, just strap yourself in to the extravaganza that is Baz Lurhmann's 'Moulin Rouge'...it really is spectacular, spectacular!
1401200613|5.0|The HUSH story line that is currently running with Loeb and Lee has been by far, the single greatest Batman story that I have ever read.  This is saying an awful lot too, because I have been reading Batman comics for a long time, and have seen some fantastic story lines.  The first eleven issues of Batman:  Gotham Knights with Hugo Strange were amazing.  Batman: A Death In The Family is an all-time classic.  And the characterization of Batman/Bruce Wayne by Grant Morrison in the current volume of JLA was marvelous.<br />So what stands out about this series being so fantastic?  Two basic things:  One - Jim Lee.  The artistry has been absolutely phenomenal.  From even simple things like the Batmobile headlights looking like the Batsignal to the double-page splash shots of Batman punching Superman around, Jim Lee is out-doing any of his work (Including X-men from 1991) with each issue.<br />Two - Jeph Loeb's writing style.  As the story continues, each issue ends with you thinking &quot;Wow, that was fantastic!&quot; and then the next issue gets better.  Loeb is also doing a fantastic job of not giving away too much information about who the real villian is and strategically placing clues throughout the issues to make you think you know who it really is.<br />At this point I have had the chance to read all but the final issue which comes out next month.  The story has been phenomenal the entire time.  Because of how great this story line is, and because the early issues are hard to find, I would strongly recommend getting the trade paperback simply to ensure that you will be able to read the entire when part two comes out, and not miss out on the best Batman story ever.
0060090367|5.0|I am currently in the middle of this book and wanted the opportunity to share this book with others before I was even finished with it!  It is wildly funny.  The best compliment that I can pay it is that I would love to be friends with both the central character AND the author!  Thank you Marian Keyes for a fantastic piece of literature!
B0000797IO|4.0|I wish they would have made a movie about Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel). Her character MADE the movie.  Watch the movie and you will see what I mean.
0066214122|4.0|I've read almost all of Crichton's novels and all have been excellent, Prey is another one of those novels. Prey unlike Airframe or Disclosure deals with alot of scientific facts concerning the new area of nano-technology (little mini-machines) It this novel our hero, Jack Foreman is a computer programmer turned house husband who is out of work do in part to the internet bubble burst. Jack is assigned a job to figure out why a large quantity of nano particles are unable to be controlled, what then happens is these nana-particles start to terrorize the lab and it's techs. It is a quick enjoyable read, but there are a few flaws in the story line that I had trouble with, like why would a programmer go out and risk his life to stop this swarm of nano particles? I also think the subject matter is pretty complicated for those who aren't too technical.<BR>Yet, this is not O'Henry, there is no truth to be seen here, it is a fun fast read and very interesting at the same time. I thought the ending was very suspenseful and nicely done. <BR>Just an aside, I can see how Michael Crichton's ugly divorce made it's way into this novel, by painting jack's wife as a heartless, power loving B!$@H, I think he was trying to send a message to her.
B00005JKC3|5.0|This movie is awesome!  The CGI transformation from Bruce Banner to the Hulk is incredibly real.  I think that the CGI of this movie is one of the best I've seen.  The story is great too, necessary for the drama and special effects.  I think this movie was very well adapted from the comic to the big screen and is worth buying on DVD.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This was the first NOFX CD I purchased, but I had heard various songs of theirs over the years and I always liked them. I have since bought Punk in Drublic, Pump Up the Valuum, and White Trash..., and all are excellent CDs. But in this one NOFX seems to sound more polished and with more \\"political\\" lyrics...but still retaining that NOFX charm. Anyway, onto the track-by-track breakdown:<br />1. Separation of Church and Skate- A solid opener with a pretty funny beginning, reminds me of an old movie. This one's about all these sellouts and how NOFX has stayed true to its core, quite a feat for someone who's been along as long as they have. 9.5/10<BR>2. The Irrationality of Rationality- The lyrics are pretty solid in this one, describing various hard luck families, but overall it just seems a little off. 8.25/10<BR>3. Franco Un-American- One of my favorites, it's incredibly catchy and yes, it is one of the more poppier songs on the CD. It doesn't hurt that the CD extra music video is funny too. 10/10<BR>4. The Idiots are Taking Over- Never has a song been so accurate of so many things (school, work, whatever) and some of the rhymes are pretty creative, too. A nice bass solo at the game makes this a solid effort. Interestingly enough, it's the longest song at 3:21, but we've come to expect short songs on NOFX CDs. 9.75/10<BR>5. She's Nubs- Finally, NOFX \\"cracks\\" and writes a song they're famous for, one with their trademark humor. This one's about a limbless girl who's such a dedicated fan she comes to all the shows even though she \\"can't pick a phone,\\" and \\"can't get dressed alone.\\" Solid punk rock in this one. 10/10<BR>6. Mattersville- Another humorous song, this one's about a place for retired punks to come when they're \\"over the hill.\\" References to AFI's Davey Havok as well as some other NOFX members and a few other punks line this one. 10/10<BR>7. Decomposeur- Not the best overall, but the lyrics are somewhat clever and I love the line, \\"She's got the grace of a tourist.\\" Just reminds me of some of my past vacations...8.25/10<BR>8. Medio-core- A song about how songs these days are all ripoffs of some other song, and about being more creative. Interestingly enough, they steal the \\"Sing a Song\\" song from Sesame Street, but overall it's still a solid effort. 9.75/10<BR>9. Anarchy Camp- A Bruce Springsteen-like sax solo at the beginning kicks off this ska type song, add a cool beat and some funny lines along the way, and you have a winner. 9.75/10<BR>10. American Errorists (I Hate Hate Haters) The shortest effort on the CD at 1:51, this is a quick song that's over before you know it. An interesting sound byte at the end. 8/10<BR>11. Two Jealous Agains- A lot of unusual lines in this one, which is also pretty short, but not that bad. 8.5/10<BR>12. 13 Stitches- A kinda quiet song about a guy's visit to punk shows around several locations, ending with him getting thrown into a post. This one, like a few others, seems to end kinda abruptly. 9/10<BR>13. Regaining Unconsciousness- Not the best song, but a decent riff and some interesting lyrics make it listenable. 8/10<BR>14. Whoops, I O'd- When I saw this song on the back of the CD when I purchased it, I thought this would be a joke track, but it's probably one of the most serious. Fat Mike sends a message about doing drugs and the problems they can cause, although he probably still supports drug use. 9/10<br />Overall, this is a great CD that's hampered only by its short length. However, this is remedied by the CD extra which has a video for Franco Un-American, a live video of Idiot Son of an @$$-hole, as well as a quirky intro and an 8-minute documentary about the 2000 Presidential Election. If you are a fan of past NOFX, you will like this, and even if you're not, take a risk and pick this one up, I think you'll like what you hear.
B00005JLSE|3.0|When I first starting watching this movie, I didn't think I was going to like it, so I didn't expect much.  But there are some very good scenes (all of which belong to Richard Gere).  Richard Gere stole this movie in my opinion.  It seemed that Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellwegger were only supporting players.  True, the characters left a lot to be desired, but Richard Gere played the sleazy lawyer perfectly.  Most of the songs in the movie were lousy.  You're not going to get a great message out of this movie.  But for pure entertainment, watch the Richard Gere parts!  (And I never was a Richard Gere fan either, till now!)
B000002AHC|5.0|The original word on this album was that it was much better than you would expect, given that the band had now kicked out David Crosby, replacing him on the cover shot with a horse.  The CD has added a track of studio unpleasantness that supports notions of both Crosby's irritability and Michael Clark's mediocrity. It's inclusion reminds me rather of McGuinn's assertive dominance. <br />The vocals, the static harmonies, and all that phasing and compression in the mix lends to the sense that the songs are different pieces of the same, consistent sound, a singular sonic vision (for all you synisthesia fans).  But the material is great and the sound is addictive.    <br /> McGuinn stated that he had originally planned the subsequent Sweetheart to be divided into distinct parts such as country and electronic. What makes Notorious so interesting is that he manages to combine such disparate influences all within the same song.  Change Is Now mixes Nashville and the Haight like nothing else ever.  The Goffin-King tunes, which just as easily could have ended up as mediocre little pieces of Monkee sincerity, instead are given covers of pleasing substance.  Crosby's songs are some of his best, even if his own personality is practically ripped off them.<br />For all its faults, a great album!
B000003TA4|5.0|Yes they killed hairbands, dethroned the King of Pop &amp; rewrote Rock music. But forget all that, forget the heroin and drug addiction, the evil meddling wife, and the cute baby and whatever other issues people incessently fuss over. Instead just focus on the great music.<br />1. Smells Like Teen Spirit 10/10 Fast, angry, fun masterpiece.<br />2. In Bloom 10/10 Great drums, Great guitars.<br />3. Come As You Are 10/10 Haunting melodies. Great song.<br />4. Breed 9/10 Great guitar/drum begining.<br />5. Lithium 10/10 Great slow, funny verses. A** kicking chorus!<br />6. Polly 9/10 Slow acousic song. The bands most risk taking song. An antirape song from a rapists point of view.<br />7. Territorial Pissings 9/10 Fast, punk raver.<br />8. Drain You 10/10 Very underrated song. One of their best.<br />9. Lounge Act 9/10 Great bass guitar on this one.<br />10. Stay Away 9/10 Great drumming.<br />11. On A Plain 9/10 Funny lyrics.<br />12. Something in the Way 8/10 Slow acoustic song about being homeless.<br />Hidden track: Endless Nameless.<br />This album is about as good as rock can get. It still sounds great even after all these years. Buy this album and you won't be disappointed.
B000084T18|1.0|People are TRYING to make 50 Cents to be the next 2Pac or Biggie. But in my opinion, he can only be compared to JaRule. People are in love with the fact that he has been shot # of times, but if people really pay attention to the music....they will realize that his music is nothing to crow about. There are only 4 songs that sound decent and they are:<br /> PIMP <BR> Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem)  <BR> In Da Club        <BR> 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg)<br />That's it. But its not enough to make you buy the entire cd. As I stated before, got change?
B000001Y5J|5.0|&quot;can this world really be as sad as it seems...?&quot;  this album is pure honesty about the world we live in, albeit from a masculine perspective.  It is a world that encourages pure hate, despair, and misery.  This EP is a close distillation of the kinds of emotions you get from most people and things in this failed world of ours.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I am going to return this DVD, and any other DVD that I purchase in the future that makes me watch 5 minutes of previews before allowing me to get to a menu EVERYTIME I insert the disk. <br />Further, although I'm not 100% sure, I think there have been changes made to the soundtrack, in that some of the original songs have been removed and replaced with others. More insult.<br />Recommend you STAY AWAY.
0767827902|5.0|I first saw this film when it was released in '71, when I was 13.  Seeing it again over 30 years later, I realize what an incredibly powerful piece of work it is.  For people who say it lacks plot and drama, I say there's plenty of it; it's just that the overwhelming talent of each and every actor in the piece brings the characters to the forefront.  The accompanying feature dealing with the making of the movie is a revelation.  Do you know whose idea it was to shoot the film in black and white (you'll never guess)?  Did you know that one of the actor's performances saved a young man from committing suicide?  This documentary shows how a masterpiece of film is created by one part luck and three parts hard work.  I can't say enough about this stunning work of art; it's truly monumental.
0792833201|4.0|This is, flat-out, my favorite horror movie of all time. It is not the best movie I have ever seen, nor the scariest, goriest, most intense, most spectactular, or most intelligent. But it holds a place in my heart that no other horror film has been able to dislodge.<br />There are three aspects to this film that I would commend to your attention. First and foremost, this movie has heart. (Well duh, it's a Spielberg project!) The family members are well-drawn and well-portrayed, and the love, humor, and tension between them is never far from the surface of the movie. The movie finds its emotional center in the relationship between the mother and the youngest daughter (portrayed by JoBeth Williams and Heather O'Rourke, who, not coincidentally, turn in the finest performances of the movie). One may accuse this film of dipping into sentimentality on occasion where these two are involved, but this emotional core is also what makes the movie tick.<br />Second, this movie does what I prefer my horror movies to do. There are a handful of moments of genuine Bejeesus-expelling fright, but this is not generally a movie for which you will be wanting to close your eyes throughout. (Which is not to say that this is a fun-for-the-whole-family movie! When it scares, it goes for the juglar. I would definitely advise a PG-13 mindset.) Nor is it a movie that focuses on the adrenalin factor (though the last 30 minutes are quite a rush). For the most part, rather, Poltergeist goes for the chill down the spine, mostly through the fear of things not seen or understood. Here, it succeeds brilliantly, on both childhood and adulthood levels. Zelda Rubinstein's speech halfway through the movie is an example of the latter, as her character Tangina explains to the by-now terrified family members what is happening to their house. Her dialogue may be corny and full of new-age spiritual references, but it NEVER fails to send a shiver down my spine, as she taps into the fear of losing an innocent child to an unknown malevolent presence, and absolutely hits pay-dirt.<br />What makes this movie particularly chilling is its soundtrack and sound effects. While this movie has been justly praised for its visual effects (though a bit dated by modern standards), this movie is brilliant at getting you to HEAR and FEEL terror instead of just seeing it. Not only does Goldsmith effortlessly weave an beguiling suburban childhood motif with thoroughly eerie and sinister orchestrations, but the sonic images are guaranteed to stick in your head just as effectively as the visual ones. Consider the static from the TV, the earth-shaking groan of a tree, Carol Anne's voice emanating from the walls, the sound of raw meat inching along a countertop, the sound of a flourescent light changing in intensity, even the sound of Tangina's voice... Poltergeists are ostensibly phenomena that create noisy disturbances, and while this movie stretches that definition quite a bit, the noises in the movie are one of the things that keep me returning to this ill-fated house and family again and agaain.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Listen, \\"Carl Haas\\", if that IS your real name, it's not Pippen, it's Pippin. An \\"i\\", not an \\"e\\". How can I trust anything you say after seeing such a glaring error? I've read the trilogy twice a day ever since the day I was born (I'm listening to the book-on-tape version as I write this), and if I say the movie's a failure, then it's a no-good stinking failure! Where was Tom Bombadil in the first movie? Where, I ask you? He was essential to the story, what with the happy jumping and singing! The Barrow-wights? NOT THERE EITHER! I soiled myself with rage and urine when the Two Towers ended with no Shelob scene! I wish Peter Jackson was here right now so I could relieve myself on his shoes. I think that if a successful movie version is to be made, it should follow the book EXACTLY, with every boring bit of dialogue from every minor character spewing out their boring family history for pages and pages and pages. It should be at least 150 hours long with no breaks, and be shown only on airline planes that have been painted bright green, if they want to try to capture a mere sliver of what Tolkien was trying to convey through his works.
B00005Y1XZ|4.0|Costello's second album, This Year's Model, took the potential shown in 1977's classic My Aim Is True and ran with it. Elvis Costello's punk sensibility, melodic yet tight guitar, and sharp political commentary was now paired to a great backing band, the Attractions (Steve Nieve on keyboards, Bruce Thomas on bass, and Pete Thomas on drums). Far from a sophomore slump, This Year's Model might be Costello's best release, and has probably aged better than anything else he's done.<br />In punk fashion, Costello's songs are short and forceful, hovering right around 2-3 minutes. However, don't expect Clash or Sex Pistols-like aggression and buzzing guitars. Costello's early work is about as \\"rock 'n' roll\\" as one can get--melodic, tuneful, and irresistable. Costello's acerbic and humourous lyrics comment on a great many things--the fashion industry on This Year's Girl, Orwellian paranoia on Living In Paradise, and a pan of commercial radio on Radio, Radio (made famous by Elvis Costello's controversial guest spot on Saturday Night Live).<br />If you can enjoy Costello's quirky vocals (I happen to really like them) than This Year's Model will definitely have appeal. Punkers looking for something different will probably really like this album. His other early albums (My Aim Is True, Armed Forces) are in a similar vein and also worth purchasing.<br />Note: For the most part the Rhino reissue is really nice, with great liner notes penned by Elvis himself and one of the best remasters I've heard in recent years. However, was the bonus disk really necessary? Big Tears and Stranger In The House could have been included on the first disk as bonus tracks, while the rest of the bonus material is made up of middling demos and live stuff that is only of interest to completists. All the bonus disk does is jack up the price of the album. Not a big deal, but more thought should've been put into this.
B00009ATIX|4.0|...you'll hate this movie.  Why?  Because they're in space and yet they still don't manage to find anything threatening to our national or worldwide security to blow up.  I think the people that gave this film 1 star are probably confused because there wasn't much action and there were no explosions.  Neither were there any psychotic evil nemeses nor slime-oozing big-headed alien species bent on the destruction of humankind.  <BR>However, these things are not what comprise a \\"good movie,\\" unless you are unwilling to let your mind out of its cage for 90 minutes.  This movie is a deliberately paced (read \\"slow\\" for you adrenaline junkies), moody, thought-provoking piece.  It mostly accomplishes its goal of setting a mysterious tone and probing certain areas of the human psyche.  <BR>That being said, before you watch it make sure you're in the right mood and can devote your full attention.  Not because it's difficult to follow, but because if you're distracted there are no explosions or highly dramatic scenes to draw you back in.  It's a movie that does well if you're alone and in a contemplative mood.  I couldn't decide on 3 or 4 stars, but went with 4 because it's at 3 right now and I think it deserves about 3.5.
B000002GK1|5.0|Before the team of Chris Cornell (vocals), Kim Thayil (lead guitar), Ben Shepard (bass), and Matt Cameron (drums) made their biggest commercial breakthrough in the classic Superunknown, they released perhaps one of the hardest, rawest, most metallic records out of Seattle. That album is Badmotorfinger, released in 1991.<br />Badmotorfinger is perhaps Soundgarden at their prime--a tumultous, pummeling titan equal parts Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, with a psychedelic metal tinge. The punky tendencies of the band's earlier material are not present here, except in the two-minute long Face Pollution and Drawing Flies. Most of the songs are 4 minutes or longer, and the band shines in this epic style. Cornell shreds his voice with some of the most impressive wails this side of Robert Plant, Thayil unleashes some suprisingly technical riffs (Rusty Cage is just insane!), and the rhythm duo of Shepard and Cameron is fast, tight, and focused. Odd time signatures are employed to full effect (ex. Outshined, Jesus Christ Pose). I love how the band was experimenting with new ideas, such as horns.<br />There is not a spot of filler anywhere on the album, at least not to my ear. Everything is excellent, though I'd have to single out the crushing epic Slaves And Bulldozers, the fast-riffing Drawing Flies, and the rolling thunder of Room A Thousand Years Wide as faves.<br />This is Soundgarden unfiltered--people who love the band for Black Hole Sun probably won't immediately like this harder and less commercial Soundgarden. However, it is every bit the equal of the masterful Superunknown. As good as the other records of 1991 were--Ten, Nevermind, Blood Sugar Sex Magik--Badmotorfinger simply \\"outshines\\" them all. Highly reccommended.
0393307050|5.0|This is where the Aubrey-Maturin series began, and it's easy to see why it took off.  Literate, witty, historically accurate, compelling, complex characters and sharply drawn action make this a joy to read.  If you enjoy historical fiction and are intellectually curious, you will love this book.  It is serious work in the best sense, in that O'Brian obviously cares about his characters and fills out their humanity with loving care, warts and all.  Pure pleasure on a number of levels.  Reminds me of some of the classical Greek stories which tell of men who serve in war and peace, their friendships, weaknesses and moments of greatness.
B000002KO3|5.0|The Talking Heads, members of 1977's CBGB scene, certainly carved a unique niche in the music world. While the Ramones were pounding out 3-chord witty anthems and Television and Richard Hell were making literate punk rock, the Talking Heads were pioneering their own blend of dancy art-rock. While every album from Talking Heads '77 to Speaking In Tongues is classic material, if I was forced to choose their best album I'd have to side with Remain In Light. Although some gripe over Brian Eno's increased role in the band (some have said that he is the &quot;fifth member&quot;) there is no denying that under his auspices as producer, David Byrne (vocals), Tina Weymouth (bass), Chris Frantz (drums) and Adrian Belew (guitar, later of King Crimson) released their best material.<br />Released in 1980, Remain In Light is often considered one of the seminal &quot;New Wave&quot; recordings, but it isn't really. The Talking Heads couldn't be compared to tripe like The Human League or Culture Club. Their music was diverse, intelligent, fluid, weird, and shake-your-hips-FUNKY.<br />The first half of Remain In Light is highly eccentric and upbeat dance music, sounding like some odd mutation of punk, African bush music, and funk. Wild polyrhythms abound, Byrne's vocals are quirky and neat bits of beat poetry (&quot;I'm not a drowning man/I'm a tumbler!&quot;) and brilliantly inventive guitarist Belew unleashes sounds more remiscient of wild animals and electronic effects than the buzzsaw blast of punk. The second half, beginning with mainstream hit Once In A Lifetime (propelled by that timeless music video on MTV) progressively slows down the blistering pace with more moody and introspective pieces, ending with the dark dirge of The Overload (written by Eno, and very unlike the rest of the record). Overall, there's not a note wasted here.<br />Remain In Light is a truly great album--if you've heard the brilliant Once In A Lifetime already, that should be incentive enough to own this record. Right? Check out previous albums Talking Heads '77, More Songs About Buildings And Food, Fear Of Music, and the commercial followup Speaking In Tongues as well.his record. Right?

B000002JKS|3.0|This album has some terrific highlights but I'd also venture to say it has 2 or 3 of the worst misses Robert ever put to tape. It was experimental, even by his standards, and in that respect, it was freeing and achieved some new things but some of them just aren't pleasant or interesting listening.<br />I give it 3 stars as a fan. I'd expect a casual listener or fan of Zeppelin era material to give this closer to a 1.5 or 2 stars and only because they might fondly remember &quot;Little by Little&quot; being included on the soundtrack of an episode of &quot;Miami Vice.&quot;<br />Unless you're feeling nostalgic, check out &quot;Dreamland&quot; instead; also a departure for Robert but one with a startling degree of sonic success.
B00005WDBY|5.0|As the old adage goes, those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it.  The March of Folly brings this message back to the forefront and although written in 1984 is as cogent a read as ever.<br />Barbara W. Tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests. Mind you, this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous.  And, yes, I admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20.<br />Beginning with the Trojans and their acceptance of the Trojan Horse to benighted Papal policy during the renaissance to Britain's stupidity during the American Revolution to questionable American policy during the Vietnam war, The March of Folly invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does.<br />Given our current war policies and efforts in Iraq, The March of Folly is a very poignant read and we must confess, regardless of our political leanings, that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable.  Who knows, there may yet be a sequel titled The March Continues.
B00005JKZV|4.0|After seeing the FOTR, which was nearly flawless in my opinion, I eagerly looked forward to 'The Two Towers'.  After all, since the entire trilogy was filmed all at once, how could TTT go wrong when FOTR was so right?  But unfortunately, it seems that Peter Jackson's team radically deviated from the book with mixed results.<br />Many Tolkien purists decry the change in Faramir's character, but Frodo and Sam's encounter with Faramir as written in the book probably would not have translated as well onto film.  The episode in Tolkien's book is rather talky, with Faramir interrogating the hobbits like a courtroom attorney in a trial. Having Faramir carrying off the hobbits and Gollum to Osgiliath adds more tension and conflict to the story and works better on film. Besides, when the Nazgul sees Frodo in Osgiliath with the ring, it naturally leads Sauron to believe that the ring is being taken to Minas Tirith, thus encouraging his attack on the city.<br />Another alteration to the story that Tolkien purists hate is having Haldir and a contingent of elves fight at Helm's Deep.  Personally, I thought the idea was rather novel, but as other critics have pointed out, how could the elves have traversed the distance from Lorien to Helm's Deep ahead of the Uruk-hai when Isengard is much closer to Rohan?  Hopefully, Peter Jackson will address this in his commentary on the forthcoming TTT:Extended Edition dvd.  With regard to the Ents, it does seem illogical on the face of it for Treebeard to suddenly want to attack Saruman after seeing the damage his orcs have wreaked on Fangorn forest when Treebeard was already aware that this was happening. But as with the changes to Faramir, having the Ents quietly deliberate among themselves and deciding to go to war would not have the same dramatic impact on the screen.<br />The changes from the book that do bother me is the exorcism performed on Theoden by Gandalf, as well as Theoden's behavior afterwards.  For all of its flaws, the animated version of LOTR was truer to the book with regard to the Rohan portion of the story, and it worked much better, whereas this part of the film in TTT was somewhat muddled.   For this reason, I give TTT 4 stars instead of the five I gave for FOTR.<br />The digital creation of Gollum works very well in TTT, in spite of the fact that Gollum does not look 100% real, Andy Serkis does a great job in creating a character that you can't help but feel for. On the other hand, the Nazgul in TTT do not seem all that scary.  We see Faramir's soldiers cringe from them in fear, but they do not do anything apart from flying around on their winged dragons and screeching.  In the books, the terror they instill is palpably felt by those around them, which is hard to convey on film.  Hopefully we will get to see them in action in ROTK.<br />Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn is slowly beginning to accept his destiny as the heir of Isildur, with him taking a commanding role in the Helm's Deep battle.  The friendship between Legolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf grows stronger, and while Gimli becomes something of a comic relief in TTT, John Rhys-Davies still makes him a likeable character.  In TTT, we also see the ring beginning to take its toll on Frodo, and his identification with Gollum's plight puts him at odds with his faithful friend Sam.  <br />TTT is a visually stunning film, and the Helm's Deep battle, while perhaps a little too long, is truly awesome.  The New Zealand landscape works to great effect in the movie, with the snowcapped peaks a sight to behold.  Howard Shore also has created another excellent score, as he did in FOTR, and I play the TTT soundtrack on my CD player constantly.   <br />But I am holding out for the extended dvd in November.  There will be flashback scenes with Faramir, Boromir and Denethor that will help put Faramir's actions with Frodo into context, plus I am sure a lot of people want to hear Peter Jackson's commentary explaining why he made the changes thatinfuriated so many Tolkien fans.  But if you are happy with the theatrical version of the film and don't want to sit through hours snd hours of documentary about how everything in the film was created and how the cast became such great buddies, then this two disc set is for you.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Like everyone else, I waited in rapt anticipation for this one. The continuation of the Star Wars epic in prequel. But then I didn't realize that Lucas, having been taken prisoner and apparently brainwashed by evil representatives of the Empire, had been ruthlessly forced to see his loyal followers as nothing more than Star Wars-starved nincompoops who would take in anything with the Star Wars logo slapped on it.<br />It started out okay and then, with the introduction of Jar Jar Binks, easily the most unbelievable and ludicrous character that Lucas has ever cast, I realized that all was lost. The majesty (and, yes, I mean majesty) of the first three installments (Episodes IV, V and VI) of the Star Wars story were diminished by this one.<br />Holy cow! Kill off the most interesting character in the whole story, Qui-Gon Jinn? What's that all about? And Ewan McGregor? What's going on there? Ewan needs to stick with shallower roles opposite shallower actors like Nicole Kidman (Okay, so she finally got an oscar. But, hey, since when did the Academy know anything?) Given McGregor's poor acting, I half way expected him to launch into a tone-deaf song or for Ms. Kidman to come cavorting across the screen as a half-dressed space trollop. It might have redeemed his dreary performance.<br />And what is this using the force to push apart droids? If that is how easily it can be done then throw down the light sabers and push the heck out of everyone! It would be like Indiana Jones first fighting the black-turbaned swordsmen for several minutes and then pull his gun and take the easy way out. But wait, that's what Lucas intended in the first place. It was Harrison Ford (our long lost Han Solo) who determined that the gun was quicker and mightier than the sword.<br />The final sequence, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's duel with a double-light-saber-wielding Darth Maul, brought me back a little. On pins and needles I thought that perhaps victory would be snatched from the jaws for defeat anda boorish movie spared by a good scene. Maybe something surprising would happen! Maybe a flying toaster would appear and save the day! <br />It started well. The scene was well choreographed and believable (in Star Wars standards). <br />And then things took a decidedly predictable turn for the worse. Qui-Gon unexpectedly takes a light saber in the abdomen and lies dying. But wait, Obi-Wan has fire in his eyes, grinding his teeth at his horned foe and the apparent murderer of his mentor. The two glower at each other menacingly--in fact they glower phantom menacingly. The force field drops and Obi-Wan engages the evil Dart Maul. Some first class light saber play ensues. There is hope.<br />But then, one two and through and through (to borrow a phrase from Lewis Carroll) Obi-Wan, the hope of Jedi Knights everywhere, slips up, misses an important parry and ends up hanging in an air shaft while Darth Maul traipses back and forth above him like a deranged rooster.<br />Now is the chance! Now surely Maul will reveal himself to the helpless Jedi, just as he had promised his master, Darth Sidius, earlier in the movie. But the cat must have his tongue. He prances stupidly on the edge of the shaft and says NOTHING! What is going on here? I recalled the wonderful dialogue between Darth Vader and this same Obi-Wan, (though several years older and much more convincingly acted by Sir Alec Guiness). <br />But wait. There is STILL hope. Obi-Wan, using the force, vaults from his precarious perch, summons his master's light saber in mid-flip and lands in front of his ruddy-faced foe. However, before he can utter a word of appropriate dialog (such as \\"You killed my master, you horned toad from Hades!\\" or \\"You scratch that rash and it will spread!\\") Obi-Wan applies his light saber and sends Maul plummeting to his bisected doom. And with his two-pieced fall the chance for a glorious ending for Star Wars Episode I went down the tubes as well.<br />While titled Episode I, this movie is easily the fourth best in the Star Wars series. Stick with The Empire Strikes Back or with Return of the Jedi, my two favorites, or the original Star Wars (Episode IV).
B000007T2Z|5.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor!. Incredible? Visionary? Artistic? Pretentious? Of course. Thank the heavens for this group of unbelievable musicians. I have never experienced, and I can bet that most of the people reading this review will fall into the same category, anything like this before. Is it music? I can say without reservation that indeed it is one of the finest compositions that I have ever listened to. East Hastings is a phenomenal piece of &quot;song-writing.&quot; Richly textured, terrifying and unbelievably intricate (without actually being pretentious), f#a# (infinity symbol) is a masterpiece of emotion, exploratory musical arrangements, haunting spoken-word pieces, and industrial noise. With only three songs (epic each in their own right) it may seem a strange purchase to the casual music fan, but you must put faith in the fact that you will NEVER hear anyone like GYBE! (or GY!BE as they are now known) anywhere else. While centered around the premise of the end of the world, the musical compositions that layer this CD still bring the listener a ray of hope -- a lacuna of optimism and despair that leaves you quivering. HIGHLY recommended -- A MUST BUY!
0887306667|4.0|The perfect companion volume to The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding.  However, I found the laws of marketing to overlap somewhat with the laws of branding.  But, hey, who ever said the marketing and branding are mutually exclusive sciences?  Or sciences at all, for that matter?<br />The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing is an excellent refresher course to overall marketing principles in the form of bite-size sections.  A quick read and a good reference.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Being unable to actually describe this CD on a track by track critique, the only way to rate ( ) is to say...wow. From the heart-wrenching opening track, Sigur Ros has crafted a veritible masterpiece. It really is a shame that it took a movie -- Vanilla Sky -- to bring this Icelandic work of art into the mainstream. There aren't really words in the English language than can describe the pastoral beauty of Sigur Ros' music. Suffice it to say then when you really want to relax -- to forget the cares of the day -- or you just need a break from your regular diet of Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, or heaven forbid Britney Spears -- Sigur Ros fits that spot more than adequately. There is such magic on this disk. It must be listened to to be believed. Highly recommended.
0767817710|5.0|In the first place, one thing needs to be made clear.  This movie is NOT based on the great book by Louis L'Amour.  But the story and movie are great just the same.<br />Gene Hackman stars as the consummate western nasty who brings several very quick gunfighters together for the shear morbid fun of watching them kill each other in gunfights.  Being the supposed quickest gunfighter of them all, Hackman plans to kill the last one standing.  But a stranger comes to town among the would be winners and changes things for everyone.<br />Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe and, of course, Sharon Stone provide very memorable performances.
0393317552|5.0|UCLA biologist Jared Diamond presents a wonderfully coherent argument setting the foundation for a truly &quot;hard science&quot; view of the behavioral History of human populations. The cornerstone of his position are the principles of Variation and Selection, first applied by Charles Darwin to the expression of biological traits of species and later by B.F. Skinner to the behavior of individuals, each birthing respectively the fields of Evolutionary Biology and Behavior Analysis. Perhaps even without knowing it, the author has bridged the gap between those two fields to the extent that a unified framework for understanding complex systems now seems to be entering maturity by creating a new precedent for the applicability of Selectionism. Diamond translates this framework almost flawlessly to the problem of scientifically explaining historic events.<br />One example of the profundity of his approach is his explanation for why Europe instead of China, despite their shared Eurasian advantages, became the dominant global influence from the 15th century onward. The geography of Europe is sufficiently disjointed that political unification of the area is difficult and impractical allowing for a higher degree of Variation in political stances among the various political entities of the region. China, however, has a river and canal system extensive and navigable enough that it became politically unified very early in its history. The implication in the latter case is that political unification leads to a homogeneity in its characteristics at any given point in time, reducing regional Variation of a population's behavioral characteristics substantially. Consequently, when the eunuch ruler of China was deposed in the early 15th century, the decision of his successors was to undo the technological and maritime advances he had supported. Water clocks were smashed and the navy was scrapped. Because China was a unified political entity (due to its vast river system), diffusion of this new anti-technology characteristic was wide and swift, effectively stalling progress throughout the entire region. This is a prime example of how concrete geographic variables give rise to the topography of a population's behavior which in turn dictates what variants are available to be selected for.<br />Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel is an innovative work and is undoubtedly only the beginning in what will surely be a slow and tedious revolution in the way we view History. The paradigm of Selectionism operating on the behavior of populations has a long road ahead of it because it basically amounts to the unpopular and unsavory philosophy of &quot;Geographic Determinism.&quot; Just as Darwinian evolution has been vehemently resisted within some religious circles and Skinnerian behaviorism resisted by mainstream Psychology, Diamond's masterpiece will take some time before being widely accepted by the general population, although its parsimony will bear it through. This classic book belongs on every persons' shelf right next to The Origin of Species and The Behavior of Organisms.
B0000024R8|4.0|Bob Dylan's position in the upper echelons of popular music is unquestioned. So, we can then ignore his comparatively insignificant debut album, right?<br />Wrong.<br />Bob Dylan's self-titled debuts album is an extraordinary piece of work. I have been listening to his work passionately for years now, but only recently got around to buying this album. I now feel ashamed. One might be surprised to find that the album contains only two original compositions, but it is entirely logical. Dylan's field at the time was folk music, a genre traditionally played by old and very experienced musicians and not 20-year-olds like Dylan. Humbled by the storied history and rich tradition of folk music, he chose to immerse himself fully into the field, absorbing influences from all its corners, before delving into writing his own folk anthems. Also, at the time Dylan recorded this album, song interpretation was considered to be paramount and original composition tangential at best. (Dylan, of course, was soon to change all that.)<br />And what a crash course in song interpretation this amazing record is. That said, though Dylan was already a master of interpretation, he was, at this point, still clearly a product of his influences. The spirit of Woody Guthrie pervades this album. The two Dylan compositions, which name and quote him, and are clearly written within his established style, with Talkin' New York, in particular, exhibiting his trademark &quot;talkin' blues&quot; parameters, are not the only instances of this. He clearly had a profound influence upon Dylan's singing style:  as few non-Dylan fans know, he is not singing in his natural voice here. Those who knew him before his immersion into folk music were used to hearing his soft, sweet voice and were as surprised by the harsh, primitive sounds of this record as everyone else was by his vocals on Nashville Skyline, where he returned to his natural sound. Dylan acknowledges his debt to Guthrie, and the other great artists who greatly influenced him, and demonstrates his humility before them, by declaring, in the last two lines of Song To Woody, that &quot;The very last thing that I'd want to do/Is to say I've been hittin' some hard travelin' too.&quot; With that in mind, it is also absolutely essential to realize that Dylan, with this album and certainly with his performances at the time, was clearly transcending the traditional rules of folk music at the time. His blues influence made him stand out above the rest, as did his songwriting ability and poetic sensibility. Though this work sounds minor now, in comparison to all of the great music that he has subsequently issued, it is startling to see just how far ahead of his time Dylan was with this album. The album features an outstanding version of House of The Rising Sun, several years before The Animals did theirs (of course, it isn't electric.) In My Time of Dyin' is here, over a decade before Led Zeppelin did it more famously (and less effectively.) Oh, and that song that everyone was making a big fuss about a couple of years ago, Man of Constant Sorrow? Dylan's version is right here, 40 years earlier.<br />Dylan blazes through several traditional folk songs, doing them justice vocally and instrumentally, and adding many of his own twists along the way, often improving the song in the process. Though Dylan was only 20 when he recorded this album, he manages to make these songs of death, suffering, and mortality seem somehow personal. His vocals on this album are truly incredible:  he truly sounds as if he were an old man, who has been through hell and lived to tell about it. Of course, Dylan's voice has been the subject of controversy throughout the entirety of his career.  Those who can't, or won't, get into the man's music cannot, or will not, get past it; those who love and treasure the man's art can't understand how others can't see past its unconventionality and realize that Dylan is one of the truly great singers of our time, and, as has been stated by numerous different people, the greatest white blues singer alive. His voice here is far from pretty, but he brings a necessary emphatic element to the proceedings that other 20-year-olds crooners could not even dream of mustering up. He sounds at times as if possessed. His guitar playing is similarly outstanding. Herein is the best guitar playing of Dylan's entire career, a particular playing style that he has never really returned to. Though these are folk songs, plus a few blues, Dylan performs them at quite a fast tempo, strumming his guitar in an almost manic manner, always in parallel with his vocals, and managing to get in some quite spectacular guitar-playing in the process. His harmonica work is also very prominent -- and quite good, at that -- better, really, than it is on his next three albums. Though there are only two originals, Dylan reworks several of these traditional folk songs into almost entirely new compositions. Pretty Peggy-O is virtually a new song. In I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow, Dylan replaces &quot;Kentucky&quot; with &quot;Colorado&quot;, thereby creating a rhyme with &quot;sorrow&quot; which would not have existed otherwise -- an early sign of Dylan the Poet. The two originals are also very good works, each managing to acknowledge his humble roots and his influences, while also allowing him to make his mark as a songwriter. <br />Certainly this album is not one of the first that you should pluck out of Dylan's vast catalog:  you should have 15 or so others before getting around to this one. It is more for Dylan fans and scholars (of both Dylan and music in general) than it is for the casual Dylan fan, who would be best served by Bringing It All Back Home. If you are truly a fan of Bob Dylan, though, and especially if you love his folk period best, then you should make this an essential eventual purchase.
B000002HH9|5.0|Everyone knocks The Cure's later stuff especially Wild Mood Swings.  I kid you not...this is a fabulous album despite the reviews.  It captures all the album title's meaning.  Songs like Want (a darker depressing song); Club America (a genuine rock n roll song-rare for The Cure); Gone!  (a relationship negativity song that tries to encourage-another Cure rarity); Mint Car (genuine pop radio hit); Strange Attraction; and Trap (a negative relationship song with strong words).  These are just a few of my favorites, but I strongly reccomend that you buy this album especially since it is so cheap anyway.  It is a true representative of the Cure's dynamics.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|This record is just perfect. From the very start to the very end this is a smooth delicious sailing. You will not go wrong playing this album at a dinner party or as a gift for the holidays. Get &quot;Home&quot; today.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|I agree to both the negative reviews for this cd. Now don't get me wrong but some songs are amazing with great guitars, BUt I find many other songs just fillers. And I did also feel that I was listening to metalica on a few of the songs(lyrics,etc). Also there isnt as much screaming as there was in the previous album.
B000089RVX|2.0|What a sad age when morbid music like this becomes the newest biggest hit.  I've never been a fan of Evanescence, although I can understand how Bring me to Life made it big.  For those of you who are into this depressing music, go ahead and buy it.  but for those of you who already have enough problems of your own, do yourself a favor and stay away from this CD.  I have to admit that Amy has a pretty good voice, though.

B00005JLSE|2.0|I really don't understand all the hype and praise surrounding this movie. It is nothing new-- \\"Chicago\\" has been around in some form or another for 70 years or so. It is pretty much like every other musical I've seen, maybe a little better than average-- Entertaining, but not something that you will look back on for years to come. Even a movie like Forrest Gump, an imperfect movie that somehow won the Oscar, is more of a classic. Rent, don't buy, with low expectations, and you might be entertained. Just don't get sucked in by \\"all that jazz.\\"
014028009X|5.0|Bridget is completely lovable in her little ways of doing things and the outlandish (but socially accurate) methodology of dealing with her life's problems.  The idea of writing a diary about a 30-something singleton in London who wants to be young, in a committed relationship with a hot guy, in control of her habits (smoking, drinking, eating), and who cannot do any of those things is a very good one.  <br />Honestly, the entire book is funny, even in the most serious passages.  It reminds us that our problems are mostly our own making, and any effort on our parts to change the cosmic balance is futile.  Thus, we are led to laugh at ourselves through Bridget's stumbling path to happiness.
080013558X|4.0|Last night, ANNIE was shown on one of the movie channels.  My almost six year old grand-daughter was visiting, and when ANNIE came on, she ran into the den to watch it.  She's \\"only\\" seen it a few dozen times before, but not for the last six months or so.<br />While I agree with many of the previous reviewers that ANNIE is corny, poorly plotted, etc., I think that they've done something right that makes all that production values stuff unimportant.  <br />My grand-daughter invariably joins in the singing of almost every song.  She gets up and dances with Annie, Molly and the gang during every dance number, and she still, figuratively, sits on the edge of her seat during the big chase scene.  She, unlike the more sophisticated reviewers here, is in love with Molly.  She cries when Molly cries, and feels better when Annie soothes Molly.<br />What more can one ask from a movie about a little red-headed orphan girl than that other little girls fall in love with her story and want to see it over and over.<br />I, for one, would like to see more ANNIE-like movies that can be enjoyed from a pure entertainment aspect by adults, and can get rapt attention from small children (and their grandparents).
B00004WGBE|5.0|The film version of the book by Anne Bronte was superbly done.  The two video set accurately sets down the often-overlooked literary work with all the tension, suspense, and beauty of the the written story.  <br />The mysterious new tenant of Wildfell Hall finds herself the love-object of the communities young buck, Gilbert.  Through their love story, the poor young woman's story unfolds to Gilbert.  In the end, the past comes back to haunt her, and Gilbert must chase his lady love back to her wealthy family.  A moment of truth between them hapens when he meets her carriage at the gate.  Will she marry him?<br />It is profoundly interesting.  Quite innovative storytelling in book form very pleasantly translated to the screen.
6305546789|4.0|HALLOWEEN<br /><br />(USA - 1978)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)<br />Theatrical soundtrack: Mono<br /><br />Fifteen years after he was institutionalized as a child for murdering his sister, the grown-up Michael Myers escapes from custody and heads back to his home town, where he stalks a number of teenage babysitters on Halloween night.<br /><br />Dismissed by many critics on its original release as a routine quickie with few redeeming virtues, this low-budget shocker - director John Carpenter's follow-up to another cult favorite, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976) - built its reputation via word-of-mouth at a time when movies could open small and hit big during a prolonged release schedule, and it ultimately emerged as one of the most successful independent productions of the 1970's. Aided immeasurably by Dean Cundey's expansive scope photography - whose autumnal color schemes and deep, deep shadows recall a similarly-styled Halloween sequence in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944) - and an unforgettable music score (composed by the director himself), Carpenter's film is stronger on mood than narrative drive, building tension through an accumulation of details before letting rip with a series of nerve-shredding set-pieces during the second half of the movie.<br /><br />Donald Pleasence dominates proceedings (in a role turned down by no less than Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing!) as an obsessive doctor who arrives in small-town America to convince anyone who'll listen that 'boogeyman' Michael Myers is nothing less than Evil Incarnate, while second-billed Jamie Lee Curtis - who seems a little too old to be playing a frightened high-schooler - is sympathetic as the vulnerable heroine targeted for destruction by an unstoppable killer, and her climactic face-off with 'The Shape' contains more than a few heartstopping shocks and surprises.<br /><br />A classic horror movie for some viewers, and a slow-burning bore for others, HALLOWEEN has nevertheless withstood the test of time, and its influence on the modern horror genre is undeniable. Followed by HALLOWEEN II (1981) and a host of increasingly lackluster sequels, until the franchise was dusted off and revitalized for a whole new generation of fans in Steve Miner's impressive thriller, HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER (1998).rror genre is undeniable.

B00005YTFG|5.0|There are many who have complained to me that Moulin Rouge is too flashy, too fast-paced, and too bawdy.  Admittedly, it is flashy, fast-paced, and bawdy, but these are the things I love about it.  It never gave me a headache, though it has several of my friends.  I think one has to be truly of a Bohemian spirit to enjoy the film like the cult that loves it does.  <br />It is a musical about a bordello in Paris in which a young playwrite and the star of the bordello's night club fall in love.  The story follows the typical beats of a musical, though there is a tragic ending.  It is woven brilliantly together through revamped 80's and 90's music that I always hated before.  It is well worth the $$$ amazon.com is selling it for, but it is not for those who like watching Bridges of Madison County.  It is a wholly different kind of film (a better one!).
B0000931QR|5.0|LODVG has undoubtedly managed to create the definitive pop album of any Spanish group in 2003!  Lo Que Te Conte Mientras Te Hacias La Dormida (which actually translates as &quot;What I Told You While You Pretended To Be Asleep&quot;) supplants their excellent previous albums as their finest release yet.  It has a wide range of styles and moods, including songs similar to their moody signature ballads from previous albums; but it's also great to see the group testing the waters of styles they hadn't previously explored.  <br />&quot;Geografia&quot; fits the latter category well.  Amaia's magically rich vocal skills meld beautifully with a very Latin tempo and arrangement to show that Spanish pop isn't wedded to a particular musical style or locked into purely pop-sounding arrangements.<br />&quot;Tu y Yo&quot; and &quot;Rosas&quot; hearken back to the well-known ballads of LODVG's previous albums, and fans of those will no doubt be thoroughly pleased with each of these selections.<br />While I don't dislike any of the songs from this album, three additional favorites I would add to the other songs mentioned above are &quot;20 de enero,&quot; &quot;Vestido Azul&quot; and the hidden dance song on track 15 (&quot;Untitled.&quot;) Each of these offers the appreciative listener a treat depending on his or her mood at the moment.<br />Finally, I agree with other reviewers who have recommended LODVG for use in Spanish language classrooms.  I have taught many different levels of Spanish to adolescents and adults, and invariably students name LODVG their favorite group in Spanish.  Amaia's beautiful voice and excellent intonation really make their songs useful for listening comprehension exercises and vocabulary building!
B00003CXXM|5.0|I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan, so I didn't watch this immediately - but when I did I was quite pleasantly suprised.  Good movie, nice pace, fabulous acting.  I will be watching this one again and suggest you at least rent it!
0385504209|2.0|This is a definite page turner. One which left a bad taste in my mouth. A horrible, predictable plot, shallow characterization and star crossed hints of romance that detract from the plot.<br />The only reason this deserves two stars is because of the way it presents an age old myth, the holy grail, in a different light that the public rarely sees. Now, let's remember, this book is fiction. I'm sure Brown took liberties to make his research fit into an idea that had amazing potential. If you're interested in the grail story, ditch this book and read some of the nonfiction books out there on the topic.<br />For those who are trashing this on the basis of their religion, something to watch out for lest it destroy your faith........ what is your faith without challenges? Nothing.<br />If you're a Christian with blinders on, maybe you should read it, if for nothing more than the challenge it will present to you.
047158651X|5.0|I've used the 1st edition of this textbook during my undergraduate days as a B.A. in biology (but concentrating in molecular biology and biochemistry), and then I used the 2nd edition during medical school and my fellowship in biophysical chemistry. If you are in the medical sciences, biochemistry, biophysics, physical chemistry, and even organic chemistry, this is the &quot;must-have&quot; book for you. It contains a more detailed explanation of the topic than typical undergraduate textbooks, but it still has excellent coherence and clarity to each and every topic despite the amount of information. I feel this book satisfies even the most &quot;physical sciences&quot; minded of us. I'm still waiting for the 3rd edition!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|For what it was, \\"Reloaded\\" was almost perfect.  The plot was interesting but not complicated.  I've seen Fishburn act better, but I don't expect Oscar-worthy perfomances from action movies.  Reeves and Moss have never impressed me as thespians but I knew that going in so it wasn't an issue for me.  I was looking for mad action and crazy special effects and that's what \\"Reloaded\\" provided.<br />I have two issues with the movie, however, that kept me from giving it 5 stars.  First, the party/sex scene in Zion was waaaayyyy too drawn out.  I don't know what purpose it served other than to make the movie longer.  Maybe it was a snack/restroom break.  At least that's what it was for me.<br />The other issue was with the fight scene against the infinite copies of the agent.  The action reached a little further than their technology could handle.  At a few points, the live action characters clearly morphed into cartoon or video game characters.  They chould've done a better job with the details.  The moves aren't as jaw-dropping when it's too obvious that cgi-men are performing them.<br />Having said that, the movie was still much better than I anticipated.  Sometimes action sequels pay more attention to special effects than the story, but this movie did a good job of advancing the story while being visually dazzling.  I can't wait for \\"Revolutions.\\"
0142000663|5.0|Grapes of Wrath in an inspiring story, which takes place during the Great Depression in the 1930's.

B00000ILE7|1.0|Basically Alien like so many American made movies were a huge hit in Australia and the UK. Alien 3 was cast with prodominantly Aussie and UK actors as a thanks for their those respectively country's contribution to thier past box office success. That's pretty much it........Did I like it? Good acting Poor plot.....
6302135621|4.0|There are two remarkable things about this movie:  1) Orson Wells was only in his mid-20s when he wrote, directed, and starred in the film, and 2) it used revolutionary filming techniques--non-chronological sequencing, special lighting effects incorporating shadow and darkness, unique camera perspectives from above and below--that have become a staple of the film industry.  Clearly, hundreds of movies to follow were influenced by the new and daring strategies used by Wells; this special edition includes commentary from Hollywood insiders describing the exact extent of the impact the movie has made.  That being said, however, what was once groundbreaking has lost some of its mystique given that so many modern films have surpassed the techniques used here--should Memento be considered one of the best movies of all time too?  Yes, the story is engaging, the mystery intriguing, and the character of Charles Foster Kane compelling; combined with the filming methods, these characteristics truly make Citzen Kane a great movie.  But although I would rank this film as one of the best ever made, I don't agree with bestowing on it the number one slot.
B000003S09|4.0|Without doubt a classic prog/art rock (call it what you will) that should be in everyone's collection. Lyrically brilliant (the relationship of Lake and Sinfield was founded here and developed during ELP days), and musically masterful.<br />[...]<br />Nevertheless the other four tracks more than make up for the one poor one, and one I would recommend.
B00000FC5H|5.0|When &quot;Let's Groove&quot; was out on the radio in 1981, I fell in love with that song. Being too young in 81 to remember anything else by EWF, I bought this CD in 1999 simply to have that one song in my collection. Little did I know what was in store for me! Songs like &quot;Shining Star&quot;, &quot;Way of the World&quot;, &quot;Sing a Song&quot;, &quot;Serpentine Fire&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot; are just WOW!  <BR>All I can say is to get this CD. Get it, play it often, and play it LOUD! It's a recipe for an instant party, even if noone's invited. <BR>Just a small word of caution though. In the process of wearing out the CD, you might irritate quite a few neighbors.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Over the years I have enjoyed Johnny Cash when I heard him on the radio, but this album made me a fan.  Thanks for the great music.
B000000WHX|4.0|Massive Attack is certainly in my definitions the forefathers of the trip hop movement, or at least one of them. Music hasn't sounded as sensuous and dark at the same time as Massive Attack's music. I always been an admirer of their music for years but it wasn't until a year or two ago did I start buying their cds. \\"Blue Lines\\" was my first Massive Attack album. Although \\"Blue Lines\\" can't matched up to the gorgeousness of \\"Protection\\" or \\"Mezzanine\\", it certainly has become the imprint of trip hop music with its dark, brooding beats mixed with the seductive vocals of Shara Nelson and Andy Horace.What makes Massive Attack work so much is that they always construct an entire album on various genres of music from hip hop to reggae, fusing them to give us this gorgeous soundscape of laid back dance music. The best tracks on this cd? I have to say that the first three songs on \\"Blue Lines\\" is absolutely mind-blowing. I especially love the smooth hip hop grooves of \\"Blue Lines\\". And I thought Shara Nelson sounded her best on \\"Safe From Harm\\". A couple of songs on the album took a little longer to grow on me. \\"Blue Lines\\" certainly showed me that hip hop isn't always going to be like the predictable garbage I hear on the radio and see on MTV/VH1/BET. \\"Blue Lines\\" is an incredible album for all fans of trip hop music. I know I love it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|One of the few sequels to truly live up to the original... and more. While there's not enough room to have more of what Tolkein wrote about in the novel present in this film, there's always the big extended version of the film to look forward to. But in its 3-hour theatrical form, it is really intense from start to finish! Looking forward to \\"The Return of the King\\"!
B000002UAX|5.0|Anyone who says this album contains as much filler as it does hits is greatly missing the point. The Beatles did not intend every song on this album to be a masterpiece of artwork. But rather, an  expression that needed to be released. I will tell you right now, if you want an album filled with songs that you can sing along and tap your feet too, then do not by the White Album. But if you want an out of this world tour into four of the greatest songwriting minds out there (Okay, three) then pick this up. And please don't make the mistake that every reviewer seems to make. STOP COMPARING SONGS! Of course Wild Honey Pie isn't as good as its surrounding songs. And I can assure you it is not supposed to be. What we have here is, in my opinion, two discs showcasing the abilites of the greates band ever. The abilites to write hits, rockers, country, obscure outcrys, and much much more. The first album roars off (literally) with Back in the USSR. From there we are taken into the world of the Beatles. Each beatle shows their own unique styles. And each contribute songs that are of equal callibur to one another. THERE ARE NO BAD SONGS! And another thing. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE REVOLUTION #9. It is not meant for that reason. It is an example of studio experimentation. This is what made the beatles great. They had enough balls to do an album like this. In closing, since I haven't really reviewed the album just the previous reviews, The White Album is a perfect example of what music should be. A no limit ride of blues, soul, jazz, and more all thrown into one pot. Buy this album and don't listen for a catchy tune, listen to what is being told to you through the beat and words that made the Beatles what they were.
0316666343|5.0|This is an amazing book. It is one that takes the reader on a journey through the mind of a little girl. I read it, and I wasn't saddened, I was hurt. We grow so close to Susie, that she is like our sister, someone we love closely about. This is amazing, and I suggest it to anyone who wants a little life but back in them.
0385503954|5.0|I am perhaps too close to having finished this book to be able to write with acuity about it. But before the first impressions fade, let me say flatly that McEwan is a great traditional novelist. His understanding of character, place and plot puts him among the best I've read. <br />Many of the 358 other reviewers have described the action of the book, so I won't. My admonition to all potential readers is simply this: make no judgments until you've finished. The levels of truth, fiction, fantasy and conscious, convenient revisionism in the narration will give you a lot to think about. <br />This is book to be reread. Don't miss it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|When I first heard of Linkin Park's Second Album (Reanimation not counted as an album, just a collection, IMO), I was so pumped. Hybrid Theory was amazing. Although once I heard Meteora, I found Hybrid Theory to be more 'trendy' than Meteora in a way, but still, both albums are unforgettable classics. Meteora is more of a step towards the metal genre, with much heavier songs than on Hybrid Theory, but the rap element still remains strong throughout the album. Some people may think the songs sound the same as on Hybrid Theory, and to them I say this: Meteora sounds a bit like Hybrid Theory because IT'S THE SAME KIND OF FREAKIN' MUSIC! Here's a breakdown of the songs for you:<br />Foreword/Don't Stay: I count Foreword along with Don't Stay, just cause that's me. Anyway, Don't Stay is the album's opener. It is a hard hitting, heavy, fast track with a great performance by Chester. The lyrics are not as deep as the other songs, but it is still an excellent track. My personal favourite on the album. Rating: 5/5<br />Somewhere I Belong: The first single off of Meteora. A good choice by Linkin Park. It's not as in your face as Don't Stay, but it is much deeper than it. Somewhere I Belong is a good all around track, but is just between Linkin Park's heavy stuff, and their emotional stuff, giving it a new sound to it, which makes it stand out. Rating: 4.5<br />Lying From You: A heavy rap-track. Lying From You is an exceptional song. Although slow, I find it to be a part of their heavier stuff, since the lyrics don't cut so deep as the up and coming tracks. Another fave of mine, this one is yet again, exceptional. Rating: 5/5<br />Hit The Floor: Another good one. This one reminds me of Papercut from Hybrid Theory, it's how Mike sings his parts. This in mind, its a heavier track than Lying From You, and seems to have an element that gives it a unique sound to it. A great listen. Rating: 4.5/5<br />Easier To Run: To me, this one sounds much like Crawling from Hybrid Theory. Although more people say Numb sounds more like Crawling, I disagree. This is the first of Linkin Park's deeper tracks on this album. It has another element Linkin Park is known for, slow and heavy songs. Easier To Run may be a track some people might not listen to, due to its lack of rap and speed. But it is one of my favourites as well. However, overall, it could be a bit better. Rating: 4/5<br />Faint: Best track on the album according to tons of people. Fast, deep and has a great sample playing over it. The classical instruments add to the song greatly. This one has deep lyrics that many people, teens mainly, can relate to. The second single from Meteora, an excellent choice for it. Rating: 5/5<br />Figure.09: Sounds more like a hip-hop track, with the sampling. Also, Chester sings this one rather than scream it, moreless. His part during the bridge is screamed, but still, this track has a new sound that doesn't seem to match anything from Hybrid Theory. Rating: 5/5<br />Breaking The Habit: Another track that has a new style to it. The fastest track on the album, as far as singing goes. It is also a track where Chester does little screaming, and more singing, which gives it the new style I am talking about. Good track all around. More of an emotional song as opposed to a heavy one. Rating: 5/5<br />From The Inside: This one is also a new style. It is a slow, heavy song. The song is sung by both Chester and Mike in a duet, meaning they are singing a line or two of each verse of the song. With lyrics that hit deep, but not so much as Numb or Breaking The Habit, it has its own style that sets it far apart from the rest. Rating: 4.5/5<br />Nobody's Listening: A very different track. As soon as it begins, you'll notice the Japanese flute playing. This song also has more of a hip-hop element to it. Chester only sings the chorus of the song. Mike takes care of the rest, and does it, as usual, very well. Rating: 4.5/5<br />Session: This one is an intrumental. With a varietyof all the band's instruments, this instrumental has more to it than just Joe Hahn going nuts on the scratch table. Howeverm this in mind, Joe Hahn's crazy scratch techniques prevail over Session. Although a more combined effort, it lacks something, making it a forgettable track, albeit a good one. Rating: 4/5<br />Numb: You want a song that knows what kind of crap is going through your mind? This is it. An excellent end to a kick ass album. Numb, the third single for Meteora, soon to be released. Has the emotional edge that has also made Linkin Park famous. It cuts straight through you, well, at least for me. This song has a sound much like Crawling and Pushing Me Away, but with the keyboard playing in it, it sends this song right to the top of the album, even though its last on the CD. Rating: 5/5<br />Overall Rating: 5/5<br />While some songs are lacking some things, it really doesn't matter. The album blends together so well, that you barely notice it. This album, in my opinion, was perfect for Linkin Park. Heavier than Hybrid Theory, it would've probably been a great debut metal album, but then, Hybrid Theory probably wouldn't have done so well, but thats just my opinion. Linkin Park knows what their fans like to hear, and are one hell of a group. I hope the next album is twice as good as this one.
B00000DGUG|4.0|Ok, not enough vowels to describe this album.  Nothing like her first, and even gets strange. Her once, angry and aggressive, voice is not found in  the album. However, her lyrics are still striking the heart of the people. &quot;Front Row&quot; is rather fast and poppy. The rest are like haunty and spooky. It is worth 10.00. Enjoy!
B000088E6D|5.0|Excellent and well produced, this is a great cd.  When Michael Buble is compared with Sinatra, it is more than true.  All the tracks on this cd are fun, not a sour note anywhere.

0694013889|4.0|My girls love this book. I bought it with the video when my first daughter was 1.5 to start introducing the idea to her. She loved it. We read it throughout the potty training. My 2.5 year old also loves this book and asks me to read it over and over. We are getting ready to start the potty training soon. Great pictures, simple idea, a classic.
0694003611|2.0|My daughter likes this book and my son probably will too, but it reminds me of the book version of Barney; kids love it and parents don't.  None of the adults in my family who have read this book like it.<br />The book it a rhythmic poem.  First we learn about what is in a little room and then we say good night to those things (Good-night, Mush?).  The artwork, like in the author's Runaway Bunny, is better in the black and white drawings than it is in the color panels.<br />The Rhythm can be relaxing if read properly and its completist use of phonic makes it good for children to read themselves, but otherwise I just don't get this book.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Now I must say I have never been a huge Madonna fan, to say the least. But watching her career and what she's doing to her fans is quite comical.<br />First of all she came up with the DIRE (ironically named) 'music' album of 2000, which was beyond awful. I mean for any standards really. I didn't think it could get worse. <br />Has Madonna lost the plost?<BR>The lyrics in this album would seem to suggest so. Simply because they are so bad I fail to imagine why ANYONE would ever include these songs in an album. Let alone MADONNA, who is *apparently* the greatest female singer of our day...the music is not better than the lyrics. Madonna has so many deluded fans she can happily release an album full of bog standard 'songs' and make millions and millions! ha how FUN for her.<br />Its just all very silly now Madonna, stop being a fool and make some PROPER pop songs for your lovely devoted little fans....tut tut
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option. Universal thinks I should watch several &quot;previews&quot; - (translation - advertisements) prior to watching my new DVD (that I paid for). <br />The ads cannot be skipped, cannot be stopped, you can't hit &quot;menu&quot; to get to the main menu. A complete joke, and an insulting slap in the face to everyone who BOUGHT the DVD instead of downloading it. <br />I suggest you avoid this DVD. There is no point buying, it just encourages Universal to make more DVDs with more unskippable ads. The copy I bought will be returned to the place of purchase. If they won't give a refund, perhaps Universal will. If they refuse, maybe they'll see us in small claims court.

B00005JKL8|4.0|this is one of the better action/military flicks to come out lately, the special effects are pretty good and the story carries on at pretty decent quality, i just wish the ending had been a little better/smarter/though out, its just abit too arrogant to think 75 or so guys armed to the teeth with a tank, mind you, shooting at one man running straight ahead, all happen to miss, but strangely i didn't feel the ending ruined the movie for me, cause it was an action flick to begin with. All in all:<br />definitely worth renting/on the dvd issue u can judge for yourself.

B000089A07|5.0|I WAS A LITTLE HESITANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE AT FIRST, BUT THEN SEEING ALL THE GREAT ACTORS IN IT, THERE HAD TO BE A GREAT SCRIPT, WELL THERE IS, IT COULD'VE GONE A LITTLE DEEPER, BUT THIS FILM LEADS VERY NICELY TO &quot;SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.&quot;<br />DEFINITE RENTAL/THEN DECIDE ON THE DVD!
0142000663|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath captures the life of many people in this time period. It is a descriptive novel, which gives a good insight as to what living was like during the Great Depression by telling the story of the Joad family, whom are moving out West looking for work because the bank has kicked them off the land. It was a good novel about the struggles of life in the 1930's.
B00000DGUY|5.0|I count myself among the biggest of fans of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler and consider him to be the greatest guitarist of all time (certainly the greatest non-classical guitarist) so on that alone I gave this CD a 5 star score.<br />I would just mention one potential drawback, that being the editing. Several of the songs, for instance &quot;Money For Nothing&quot;, are in their 'single' form, which is to sat edited for time to fit into an FM radio broadcast, therefore, if you really want the whole song you need to buy the original CD. So this is a plug to buy the whole collection. More expensive, surely, but totally worth it.<br />I am a bit unsure who picked the songs for this CD, but the mix is a bit tilted to newer stuff. I think it might have been improved if a couple of tracks (&quot;Heavy Fuel&quot; comes to mind) had been left out and the unedited versions had been put on the CD.<br />Of course, this is all quibbling. I still recommend the CD, the sound quality is superb and the mix of old and new makes it an interesting career retrospective (to date). I have seen Dire Straits and Mark in concert several times and &quot;Local Hero/Wild Theme&quot; live at the close of the CD still gives me goosebumps when I hear it.
B00003RQNJ|2.0|Wasn't this a big Hollywood production?  Couldn't they afford to film on location?  The sets of \\"Bolivia\\" look like they were filmed on location in rural California with local Mexicans as extras.  If anyone has ever been to Bolivia (or even opened an encyclopedia), they know that Bolivians look, speak, and dress nothing like Mexicans.  Watching this \\"classic\\", I couldn't help but be floored by the incredibly poor job they did in the closing sets of the film.  Any historic value the film might have had went down the toilet for me during those last scenes.  If you are primarily interested in movies for their popcorn entertainment value, don't dispair, as you probably won't even notice this flaw.  For me, it really ruined any value the film might have otherwise had.  Its like casting Keanu Reeves as Hamlet, and somehow he pulls it off, but at the end \\"Bill\\" comes out then he an Hamlet embrace and say \\"Excellent!\\".  Oh never mind.
0425152251|1.0|Sophie's World, it would have best been not named a novel. Yes there is that aspect of novel to it, but it is so dilute and weak that it makes the fiction in this book unnecessary and redundant. Nonsensical, imprudent, and diaphanous fictional story line do nothing more than deface its value. The characters lack dimensionality and their personality and history are left in obscurity. The fictional story line is fragmented and disconnected. The ending is not only asinine but also obscene. The causes for the actions of the characters and why namely Sophie was chosen to learn the history of the philosopher is mysterious. Overall the fictional aspect is weak and lacking: unnecesarry.<BR>Expanding on philosphy is , however, the strong attribute of this &quot;novel&quot;. Although the information about the philosphers beliefs was vague and needed more depth, the implementation of the examples to facilitate the understanding of those beliefs was wonderful.<BR>The reason for writing this book is puzzling. Perhaps it is a perfect guide to the philosophical thought for someone is in a hurry to be acquainted with it. Otherwise there are much more relevant works printed to provide much better information on the topic, to say nothing of the original works by the philosphers themselves. So, if expedient acquaintance with philosophy is what you want, this book I would somewhat recommend. And to Gaardener, my recommendation is to have written this book sans the fictional parallel.
B0000028UK|5.0|i have been a pearl jam fan since the 'ten' days more than eleven years ago. i have purchased each new record on its release date, flown across the country for shows, collected obscure editions of singles, and generally been a pearl jam nut for more than a decade. <br />that said -- this is the band's finest recording to date. THIS IS pearl jam. from the menacing opening notes of 'go' it is clear that pearl jam sought to refine and legitmize the genre they brought to the forefront. <br />'grunge'? no.<BR>'dirt rock'? no.<br />this is what rock should be -- guitars, drums, and vocals. this epic takes the listener through the entire gambit of emotions -- from the straight up rage of 'rearviewmirror', which is the best song here, the political rantings of 'blood', the introspection of 'elderly woman...' all the way to the almost triumphant 'dissident'. <br />buy this record if you would like to hear the cd which all other rock records should be measured against.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvana were the band of the moment in the early 90's; the grunge movement that they and other Seattle bands of those times brought to the masses had been commercialized and browbeaten by corporate America. But rather than capitalize of the massive sucess of Nevermind, the did a complete 180 with the followup, In Utero. Much darker and harsher sounding than the previous album with the intention of getting rid in the bandwagon fans enthralled with the catchy &quot;pop&quot; tunes the band had created, but ironically gained them more commercial acclaim. Songs like Heart Shaped Box, Rape Me and Pennyroyal Tea less registered with alienated and angst ridden youth and more with their more popular antagonists. Kurt Cobain became a star and the &quot;it&quot; boy for the wrong reasons, and you know what happened next. I am a psychiatrist and I tell my patients who have had suicidal thoughts or near death encounters about Kurt; at least his death his helping people live life. Thank you, Kurt.
B000000XB9|5.0|very good compilation, includes all their good stuff...get chronlicle vol 2 if you need more.
B0000028M7|5.0|It's a shame that Alice In Chains doesn't get the recognition they deserve. They were over shadowed by grunge's big three(Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden) pratically their whole career,despite being just as talented. And that talent is best represented in their best accomplishment, Dirt. This came out in 1992, right alongside Nevermind, Ten, Core and Badmotorfinger, and is just as special. Layne Staley has got to be one of the best frontmen ever,even though he shared the spotlight with other greats of that time(Kurt Cobain, Billy Corgan, Eddie Vedder,Scott Weiland and Chris Cornell). There are many rock staples like Rooster, Angry Chair and the classic Would?. Perhaps what sets AIC apart from the rest other than being heavier and darker than the other grunge bands, is that Layne geniunely had a problem with drugs, a problem that would cost us another musicial great taken in his youth. Rest in peace, Layne.
B000069AUI|5.0|second outing from the guys who brought us parachutes. though not as good as parachutes, still near-perfect music.
B0000640VO|5.0|In the beautiful city of Paris, in a beautiful apartment building, in a beautiful, cozy home, lives Amelie Poulain, who enjoys the simple pleasures of life, but longs for something more, desires, in the deepest recesses of her heart, someone to love and to have as her own. <BR>     But, instead of helping herself, she begins to help other Parisians around her, whether helping them to relive their entire childhood or just to brighten their step a little, she becomes a sort of guardian angel, working good deeds wherever she goes.<BR>     This film is a stunning fantasy romance, a true romance, something we as film viewers have not seen in a very long time. Audrey Tautou glides from scene to scene, as one watches her one can almost imagine her floating on wings.  Her performance is virtually flawless, every inch of her character slowly being revealed, her initial facade of perfect happiness, and her deep feelings of longing uncovered by the painter, the man they say is made of glass.<BR>     Mathieu Kassovitz, as the quirky adult video store employee, is also wonderful; awkward and curious and just as longing as amelie.<BR>     As the film comes to a close, the viewer cannot help but feel a tingling at the edges of his or her mouth, quickly developing into a full grin, a symbol of the true happiness the film portrays.
B00003CXS4|5.0|humor, action, and twists all in one. whats not to like? oh and great accent from pitt.
0312305060|5.0|This is nothing short of a masterpiece.  As one drifts into its pages, one cannot help get lost in the beautiful stream-of-consciousness prose written by michael cunningham, in a marvelous tribute to virginia woolf, one of the novel's central characters.<BR>     The novel covers one day in the lives of three women, two fictional, one real:  Laura Brown, a troubled 50s suburban housewife in debt to her loving husband, son, and unborn child, but struggling with the fact that she is stuck in a one-sided marriage; as much as she tries, she does not love her husband as much as she wishes she did. The second fictional character is Clarissa Vaughan, a bisexual present-day resident of Manhattan, who is caring for friend and former lover Richard, a recognized and award winning poet, who is dying of AIDS.  The third character, a real historical figure, is Viriginia Woolf, also in a marriage that restrains her; although she loves her husband she longs for city life in London, which would free her but also free her deadly mental illness.<BR>     These three women are all connected through Woolf, as Laura reads Woolf's novels in an attempt to block out the real world, Clarissa lives a modern version of Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; and the third character Woolf herself. <BR>     In his Pulitzer-Prize winning masterpiece, author Michael Cunningham manages to create a tribute to a master writer as well as a stunning original work rolled into one beautifully-written prose composition.
B000002MTR|4.0|Ok, people talk a lot about the chemistry between Flea, Anthony Kiedis, Chad Smith, and John Frusciante, and there's a lot of merit in that, but Dave Navarro brought something to this album that John Frusciante could not, and that's competent playing. When John plays, it's an exploration of the instrument, he's riding it and seeing where it goes. Dave Navarro has a more disciplined style, so instead of riding, he drives his guitar exactly where he wants it to go. The music in this album is more precise, more calculated, and just as good as any other Pepper's album, if not a bit better  be being a breath of fresh air. There's less freaking out and more rocking out, if that makes sense. In summary, and diehard fans should really relax and just go with the flow. If you take anything from the music, then that's it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Peter Jackson is a truly amazing person; a mentor to any amateur filmmaker (in my opinion). Tolkien's epic classic is preserved and enhanced so much onscreen that one begins to wonder if any text has ever been adapted to the screen so successfully. And if the one happens to be me, I do more than wonder; I know.<BR>     The performances are marvelous. Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins is stunning, haunting, and conflicted, as he is put in situation after situation in which he must rely on his willpower, which is fast dwindling as he succumbs more and more to the corruption of the One Ring.  And Sean Astin, as his faithful companion Samwise, is equally impressive while he has to bear the negative effects of Frodo's increasingly bad temper caused by the Ring.  Andy Serkis, as the CGI Gollum, is also excellent, an extremely sad character who tries to remain good but is also slave to the Ring; above all else he wants his Precious back.<BR>     Supporting characters are also fabulous, Liv Tyler as Arwen nearly brought tears to my eyes as she made one of the most painful decisions of her life, the one lonely tear trickling down her face was beautiful and haunting. Ian McKellen is great as always, as Gandalf the white, Viggo Mortensen is slightly cliched but fantastic as Aragorn, and there are countless others too numerous to mention.<BR>     The scope is amazing, as parts of New Zealand totally transform into Tolkien's Middle Earth.  Every camera angle is beautiful, the Howard Shore score is awesome.  Nothing is overlooked, and there is no doubting the genius of Peter Jackson and the rest of his crew.
0783240287|1.0|Hmmm....how to sum up &quot;Joseph And The Not-So-Amazing Technicolor Screamcoat?&quot; Well, it stars Donny Osmond, Joan Collins, and a bunch of singing five-year-olds. How much more proof do you need that this is a complete waste of existance?<br />It starts off with a bunch of screaming little kids running around in an auditorium, presumably at an elementary school. This goes on for about fifteen minutes. Really. This was enough to give me a headache. Then again, considering how the rest of the movie went, I would've been happier just watching that for the next two hours.<br />Why do I hate it? Well, for one thing, THERE IS NOT ONE SPOKEN LINE IN THE WHOLE THING! EVERYTHING - YES, EVERYTHING - IS SUNG!!! Yes, I know this is a &quot;musical&quot; - but even &quot;Grease&quot; has regular spoken dialogue. Also, the makeup and acting - it could not possibly be the least bit cornier. The whole production looks like the kind of dream you'd have after eating some old enchiladas you found in the back of your fridge. What an insult to everyone and everything.<br />Do I really need to continue going on about how bad this movie is? I think not. Just don't watch it, and you won't need to run to your local drug store and pick up ten cases of Advil.<br />Snoochie Boochie Noochies!
B0000011P7|5.0|When this solo album was first released in LP format around 1983-84, I played it more than any other Tull album that came out around the same time.  So what if Peter-John Vettese contributed with synthesizers, piano and whatever else?  I loved the album and still do.      Rather than start with a list of songs on here that I think stand out, let me say that on every Tull or Ian Anderson solo album there has always been one and ONLY one clunker that I don't like.  \\"Trains\\" gets the gate here.  Delete.  It's just too repetitious and doesn't have much of a melody.        Other than that, I love every song on here especially \\"Looking For Eden,\\" one of my favorite songs ever.  On my own home made Best of Tull CD's, Vol. I and II, I added it and \\"Made In England\\" as well from the 33 songs I included.  Another haunting but beautiful number included here is \\"Different Germany.\\"  I forgot to mention \\"Black & White Television\\" in my first review of this album which is another standout for me.                I've read that Ian Anderson has said that perhaps this wasn't what a solo album should be.  True.  \\"The Secret Language Of Birds\\" and \\"Rupi's Dance\\" are more in keeping with Ian's use of flute, acoustic guitar and vocals.  Okay, then let's consider this to be \\"Tull-lite.\\" I still enjoy it just as much and give it high fives. :-)
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I have to agree with some of the harsher reviewers of this movie but only partially. I agree that the whole dirty dancing awkward sex scene in Zion should have gone. It inspired nothing more than these three words... what the h***?!!?<BR>Also Morpheus has turned into some kind of poetic speech making moron. Where's the controled cool to the core leader from the first matrix?<BR>But beyond that and a couple other irritations, I found the Matrix Reloaded to be intriguing. It was definately worth seeing and I will most definately see the third one and in theaters. The plot twists were just as mind blowing as the plot it's self, equalling almost the gasps of surprise evoked by the original matrix. Overall I would recommend this movie, don't let a few stilted scenes drive you away, I'm glad I didn't.
0446608955|2.0|The man is building an empire -- presumably a very lucrative one -- by crafting a simple, winning formula. One that I could have crafted if only I'd thought of it before he did. The formula is so simple: write a weepy, excessively sentimental love story. That's it. That's all it takes. Who buys books? Mostly women. What do they buy? Weepy, sentimental... well, you get it.<BR>This book isn't even well written (as one reviewer has pointed out here, the first-person protagonist starts out telling his story in teenage-speak -- even though he's now a middle-aged man). But all Sparks had to do was create a character who was so smitten with the ethereal girl that he NEVER got over her -- never even considered getting married or even having a relationship of any kind with any other woman as long as he lived. Voila -- his target audience is hooked. Sparks gets richer. I get more jealous.
630018403X|4.0|First of all when I first saw this movie I thought it was brilliant and in some ways it still is. As for the characters at first I strongly disliked Molly Ringwald's character. I thought she was full of herself,spoiled,and pristine.I liked Judd Nelson's character the first time I saw him. I thought here's a guy who is tough and rebellious but not too much of an @#$hole about it. I thought the jock and the nerd were much too stereotyped at least at first. I loved Ally Sheedy's basket case character(Allison).She was probably autistic and she was very mysterious which I found pretty sexy.<BR>  Anyways when they are together at first they criticized each other and made some pretty ignorant remarks. John Bender was one of the first to talk about his problems he had at his house and was pretty convincing about it. Later they all had their stories to tell. They may have been together just for a day but what they shared were things that they should remember for most of their lives.
0451169514|4.0|The first thing I realised after I finished reading IT was that it seemed almost less of a novel, and more of a playground where the reader can explore King's mind at work. The topics of childhood, sexuality (to a minor extent), fear, bullying, love, strength, and human nature are explored in the 1000 or so pages. <br />Tackling the novel seemed to scare me a little at first because of the size, but I also enjoy being involved in a lengthy novel too. King's IT didn't deliver exactly what I expected, but it was interesting altogether. I had assumed it would be a horror/terror novel but it wasn't that at all. It didn't keep me awake at night or scare the bejesus out of me in the least, so if you are looking for a similar kick you may well be disappointed. I think that impression came from seeing the movie some years back.<br />IT revolves around a group of friends who have uncovered something frighteningly unusual in the town of Derry. Children seem to go missing in alarming, unusual ways and the place seems oblivious to the strange happenings. When this group of friends, particularly 'Big Bill', go through a series of awkward, nightmarish events, they realise that they must combine together to stop the awful creature which seems to be everywhere. <br />I would agree that IT needs some editing, for while it's an interesting read, it's not exactly a page turner. The anecdotes told at times seemed off topic and rather out of place. While they were well told and so realistic, they were often boring. We want an interesting story Mr King, not a documentary. The themes of bullying with the stereotypical Henry and his clan seemed overly emphasised and for a while took centre stage. You would think the bullies were as much if not more of a threat then IT itself, which doesn't seem plausible for children who were 11 year olds. There are other times when you think is an 11 year old capable of this? Regardless, the recreation of childhood is very well done, particularly the character Ben and the issues he faces.<br />Another critisism would be that the novel seems to shift perceptions. During the first half, IT is terrifying, while closer to the end, this doesn't really seem to be the case. IT seems more of a dormant nuisance later on. Some concepts are not fully explained and I found it rather irritating that after such a lengthy novel, humour and ridicule was used in several places when it really should have been quite serious.<br />There seemed to be a lack of character development. Richie was funny and comical but he never stopped being so. Ben was quiet and reserved and kind. Sexual nuances and undertones always surrounded Beverly's character. Eddie was a little too unrealistic and often annoying. Bill himself never developed at all, always maintaning the die-hard hero type of stance. This made the novel feel a little dull and boring, as you never really question their capability of dealing with the monster that is IT.<br />Personally I liked the ending but thought it seemed a little dissapointing. Let's just say you might have expected more from IT and IT's powers, especially after reading about IT's previous capabilities.<br />The story is written with ease and flow that really makes you raise your eyebrows. King is very talented. He meld's the story, combining both past and present without any effort and it's easy  to follow and understand, while the concepts are still enigmatic.<br />Overall I thought IT was an entertaining read, though it did get boring in some places. It's worth it for a well told story however. The effort put in is incredible, and will raise the bar of expectation for future novels you read.<br />On a side note, I wasn't impressed when I picked up King's DREAMCATCHER and skimmed through the blurb. Another story of a group of friends who tackle something strange in Derry? How many of these does he write?!
B00009V7OR|3.0|It amazes me that when you spend millions of dollars on a movie that the sound is way down the line.  The sound and picture go hand in hand.  This movie would knock your socks off if the remastered it in DTS ES sound.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I think this movie well exceeds its predecessor in all aspects.  Peter Jackson does a great job of running 4 to 5 storylines concurrently, and without allowing the audience to tire of the story.  Just as it starts to get a little boring, Jackson gives us a breathtaking piece of scenery or a dynamic battle/action sequence.  I must say that I feel one actor is glossed-over somewhat in the movie and in the extras on the DVD.  Sure, McKellan (Gandalf)...Bloom (Legolas)...Mortensen (Aragorn).... and others do a wonderful acting job, but none can surpass Christopher Lee (Saruman).  My favorite scene in this whole movie is Saruman's &quot;To War!&quot; speech.  This is the highlight of the film....the rest of the story moves downhill from there.  Lee just does such an awesome 30-second speech...I want to just jump right in and build an army for Mordor myself!  He is so convincing as the evil wizard.  It bothers me that Lee's acting is not more recognized.  I was quite disappointed that he was not interviewed very much for the DVD extras.  I sure hope this will be remedied in the Extended Edition (also additional scenes with Saruman would be nice!). <br />Overall, the DVD is well packaged and the on-screen menus are very easy to navigate.  I was very happy to learn (upon opening) that the DVD designers had made each disc with a photo of each of the Two Towers.  Also, the Ringwraith riding into the screen every time something is selected on the extras disc is a nice touch.  Good work, New Line!!  I am sure looking forward to the Extended Edition in November...and the Return of the King in December!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Forget quibbles about minute details, this is an outstanding achievement and DOES follow the books in all ways necessary.  I could not believe how well this has been put together.  The casting is fantastic, the story runs well, even jumping between the various actors so we know what is going on all over Middle Earth.  It is wonderful.  To address a few of the details, if jackson had not added a little point here or there, the 3rd movie would be a bit short as the 3rd book is half appendix.  It also the changes also explain things that are more difficult to put into a visual format.  They work well.  I, for one, am delighted with the whole thing and this is a monumental achievement.  Congrats to Jackson and cast on a job well done!
B00006879E|4.0|This is definitely a solid debut CD. It's good listening from beginning from end. I only have a few gripes about some of the songwriting-but that can be forgiven, seeing as how this is their first CD. Maroon's first single, \\"Harder To Breathe\\" is not really a good preview of the rest of the album. If you're looking for a cold rock CD, this is probably not it. Lead singer Adam Levine has a soulful, sexy voice, unquestionably some Michael Jackson influences there. The songs are definitely catchy. Some highlights-\\"This Love\\", \\"Tangled\\", \\"The Sun\\", \\"Sunday Morning,\\" and \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\". All in all, this would be a good CD to buy, and hopefully these guys will make more good music in the future.

B00005LC4B|5.0|In a different turn, Scorcese turns from the art films he's known for, and dives straight into a commercial film, but told in a wonderfully lurid tradition straight out of the crime pulps, and comes up a winner! Visually stylish, and characters that are more nuanced that the original movie(especially the family), and therefore more in the noir character tradition.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Most people were so hyped up for the release of STAR WARS, EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE that it was just a huge letdown for them.  It's far from the best in the series, I will say that, but it's not bad, by any means.  It's cool, because we finally get to see Darth as a little boy and we learn his backstory, along with the rising of the Republic and the onciming tension between them and the Empire.  Also, we get to see Yoda a few hundred years younger!  But, check it out if you haven't yet, because it's not really a bad movie.  Just don't expect it to be the best in the series.
B00005JMD3|1.0|This movie is basically all action and little plot. The plot if you can manage to find one though all the action is to get a big terrorist or drug lord out of the USA(and Los Angles). The villian offers over TV $100 million to anyone who frees him. <br />it was a predictable cop film, although the opening sequence rather pushed the PG-13 rating. I thought that maybe it should of been rated R! The opening of this movie is very violent for a PG-13 film.<BR>Larry Poindexter(Body Chemistry 4) is also in this movie as chief of police .he is has starred in some OK movies, but people should regonize him from \\"JAG\\". <BR>The movie was nice escape from reality, just be sure to check your brain out at the movie theater door.
B00004TRD8|1.0|I still fail to comprehend why people say that this is the best Terminator movie, especially now that there are two other Terminator movies that are better.  Putting Linda Hamilton's exceptionally poor performance (and I won't even get started on Eddie Furlong), this movie offers nothing but show-off special effects sequences that, by today's date, are no longer impressive.  The liquid metal man looks like a windows 95 screen saver.  I understand that this film was revolutionary for its time, but it certainly doesn't hold up to the second sequel as far as special effects or story go.  Which leads me this: why is the story in T-2 so elementary?  And why does the Terminator &quot;feel?&quot;  I swear, there was once a day when James Cameron wasn't so damned Hollywood.  What a terrible move.
B000007PI9|5.0|Action-packed, and it has Stallone.  What else could you want, except maybe some rhubarb.
0380789019|3.0|It is rather plain book and I can't see what people find so special about it. The characters are way too comics-like and that might be just the problem - I don't like when comics books are written, I prefer them to be just a comics book.<BR>In fact, the only characters that I truly felt had some depth were the two murdering villians. Richard was in shock for 90% of the book, Hunter is flat (super hero) even though the twist in her story and Door didn't do anything to get any depth and was just another grey character.<BR>Other than that, the plot is fun, though the ending is way too weird for me, I don't like plots that twist so much without any visible explaination.
0553573403|5.0|I just loved this book so much, as soon as I finished it I went out and bought the next one in the series (and then the third, but still waiting on the fourth to be published.) Well written and interesting characters.  I've read other fantasy fiction series such as Wheel of Time and several David Eddings series but this one is SO much better. Often compared to Lord of the Rings because of the well described adventure and epic story.  My 13 year old son likes the books too!
B00004YZ36|5.0|Ah, sublime Mozart! Godlike in all the genres of music, you greet us in the playing of Geza Anda, a pianist and composer who knows and loves this music. His knowledge and love are demostrated by his respect for the music while a.ding a modern twist. This is beautiful, wonderful music. Buy it and feel not only the love and wisdom that Mozart put into the music but the insight that Mozart put into writing these pieces.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the best cds I've ever heard.  It is deep.  He has a lot of emotion and an excellent voice.  I really could listen to this all day.  He is a true singer and this cd is true entertainment.  And if you are a big fan of music that actually means something and is deep then you will also find he is an amazing live performer.  Amazing.  I highly recommend this cd.
0385504209|2.0|An intriguing story but the ending may lead to more than a few raised eyebrows. The author has a talent for writing and storytelling, but the book could have been a better read by eliminating the repititious and rather juvenile fascination with the female anatomy. It detracts from an otherwise well-written story and provides absolutely nothing for the either the plot or the puzzles. Because of that and because the fiction borders too close on the fantasy, I only gave it 2 stars.  I'm glad I only borrowed the book instead of buying it and I probably won't bother to read his other publications.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Well, I won't get into summarizing the plot here because plenty of other reviewers have already done that. Plus, I think it's always much better to see a movie without knowing what's going to happen next.<br />I will say that this is one of the most emotionally touching movies I have ever seen. And I'm no wimp. I workout at the gym 4 times a week. I've bench pressed 300 pounds. I pride myself on my toughness. But this movie completely broke me down and had me in tears. Everything about the movie adds to the emotional impact, from the beautiful setting to the musical score, but most especially due to the outstanding performance of Zhang Ziyi.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The first time i heard this record, my buddy and i were riding around the darkened streets of Windsor, listening to the radio. What else was there to do during the blackout on Aug. 15. and 16th? Be The Rain came on, and it was so good that i thought it must have been an old tune from Neil's vaults from the 1970's, and it was seeing the light of day....Well, to my pleasant surprise, it was announced as from the new album by Neil and Crazy Horse called Greendale....I bought the thing a few days later, and i was shocked at how good the songs, lyrics, storyline, and raw, live recording quality are...I HAD NO IDEA NEIL HAD A NEW RECORD COMING OUT! What an absolute surprise this thing is- It is a great collection of songs that kick butt and are melodic, and is experimental at the same time, with the occasional use of the megaphone, spoken-word vocal style, and real nice long songs.....there are some deep grooves on this record, and believe me, if they don't sink in at first, give them a chance....Just because i've been a Neil Young fan for about 13 years now, doesn't mean i buy everything of his that comes down the pipeline....but Greendale is on a par with Sleeps With Angels, Tonight's the Night, On The Beach, Harvest, After The Gold Rush, ect...This record is definitely WEIRDER than the afformentioned LP's, but i believe it is an experiment that works great....These guys are in their 50's and they slay almost ANYONE out there making so-called Rock and Roll these days....If you like Neil Young & Crazy Horse, and if you have the patience for a little experimentalism, BUY GREENDALE! Still stunned...
B00009V7T2|5.0|You people that have given this CD terrible reviews are absolutely nuts.  This a wonderful break from the horrible music that is currently corrupting the airwaves.  Sure, some of you may find it hard to swallow complexity, but open your mind and free your brain from the 3 or 4 chords that corrupted it previously.  <br />This record is daring, and complex.  It has wonderful musicianship, and the layers of sound are absolute beauty in my ears.  <br />Too often, we want the hook, the pay off, the \\"pop gem\\".  Well, this aint it.  If you want that, turn on your radio and turn off your brain.  When it's ready to take in a little more, try this again, you might just like it.
B0000696I0|4.0|TMNT II has taken all the good things from the first movie and improved upon them. All the jokes and the action are still there. The only thing is that really dates this movie is the song performed by Vanilla Ice, but he was popular at the time... <br />What really makes the sequel better than the first though, is the presence of Ernie Reyes Jnr as the pizza delivery boy. His fighting skills are excellent, he has a real comic flair and he's cute too! He really helps to &quot;bring this movie to life&quot;.
B00005JLTN|5.0|I am very critical of many movies. I absolutely love telling people how much most movies these days are simply bad. Despite all of the apparent \\"dissapointment\\" with this film, I was incapable of coming up with anything seriously wrong with the Matrix: Reloaded. Every scene is incredible. There is a great sense of discovery as Neo and crew go about searching for answers, and doing their business of kicking (the bad guys) The highway car chase is absolutely breath-taking... I kept saying \\"oh my god\\" in the theatre. I have not seen the DVD obviously, since it hasn't come out yet, so I can't tell you about the features and all that. But the movie itself is amazing. I only wish I could have seen it more than once.
0385504209|5.0|Imagine a murder committed in the world famous Louvre Museum in contemporary Paris ---the chief curator's body found beneath the immortal painting of the Mona Lisa. Then imagine yourself swept up and dropped amidst a secret society comprised of some of Western civilization's most illuminous artists and thinkers such as Da Vinci, Boticello, Sir Isaac Newton, and Victor Hugo, among others. The scope is epic in presentation. But that is exactly what the writer Dan Brown accomplishes with his stunning novel THE DA VINCI CODE. This is an extraordinary tale of suspense, exploring brilliantly the legendary mysteries of Western culture. The painstaking research obviously involved in this literary project is commendable. The writer artfully weaves his rich story within and around this historic and socioaesthetic context ---a daunting task in itself. Furthermore, he provokes rather subtly the reader by raising certain perhaps troubling issues of a clear religious nature. The main characters Sophie and Robert are immediately ensnarled in a world of high-level intrigue and sophisticated thrills. The reader is guaranteed a fascinating ride. Highly recommended novel by a talented writer.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|That one word describes this cd.  I am a new listener to Johnny Cash, in fact I am only 15 years old.  But listening to his music touches me where music hasnt before.  When I listen to him I can just tell he really means it, he is singin from his heart.  All his music on this cd will relax you no matter what mood your in.  But the real shining star on this cd is the track &quot;Hurt&quot;, when I found out that Johnny Cash redid this song from Nine Inch Nails, I was in shock, I thought it was the other way around.  That song and the video are both great and should be remembered forever.  Another of my favorite tracks on this cd is &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;.  Again he borrowed this song from Sting and altough I havent heard Stings version, I dont see how it could be better.  &quot;A Man Comes Around&quot; is a light beat song but actually has a strong message in it.  Thats what I love about all these songs they all carry a message or tell a story, but it dosent get boring.  Even, when my parents started to hear &quot;A Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; they were also in shock, that he chose songs like that, they didnt like it as much but I dont know any better than this.  All around this is a great cd to purchase if you want good quality music that comes from the heart of a 70 year plus legendary musician.
0399226907|4.0|This is a sweet little story about a caterpillar who becomes a \\"beautiful butterfly.\\"  My 16-month-old daughters got this book around their first birthday and love it.  It really holds their interest which is very much not the case for many longer books.  The artwork is simple, yet fascinating to young children (and their parents as well).  Little fingers poke at the holes in the food and my girls love the shorter pages because they're easy for them to turn.  The pictures and story help babies and toddlers learn to identify simple objects (moon, sun, leaf, caterpillar, butterfly, etc).<br />We read this book along with several others every night as part of our bedtime routine, but this is the only book I have yet to get tired of even though I have long since memorized it.  It's also the only book that holds my daughters' attention almost every single time.  It's a great addition to any baby or toddler library.

B0000A98ZP|1.0|Nice that this is in stereo (original DVD is mono) but guess what?  There are errors.  I noticed one part in the middle of the movie where Allison says a few lines quickly and the audio sync is noticeably off.  No excuse for this.<br />Probably the best of the John Hughes brat pack movies but a really poor job on the DVD.
079073639X|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two-thirds of this movie, but the plot ended up going in a really weird, awkward direction that culminated in a disappointing dead end of a conclusion.  Worst of all, many questions are just never answered, and a little hocus pocus at the end only adds to the unfulfilling experience.  I have to question a good bit of the science found in Sphere as well, but I'm willing to overlook that kind of thing if the story really delivers, and this story does not really deliver at all.  The cast is an impressive one, the special effects are cool if not always ultra-realistic, and the movie does engender a feeling of wonder followed by an increasing sense of suspense throughout the first hour and forty five minutes or so, so it seems clear to me that the source of my dissatisfaction is the plot.<br />Dr. Norman Johnson (Dustin Hoffman), a psychologist, thinks he is being taken to the site of a plane crash in order to work with the survivors of the trauma, but the truth of the matter, which he discovers only after his arrival, is that he is supposed to lead a science team beneath the ocean to study the submerged remains of a spaceship.  His fellow scientists are a motley crew, all of them named with little forethought in a report Johnson wrote years earlier on the subject of hypothetical contact with alien creatures.  His team consists of a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), an astrophysicist (Live Schreiber), a biologist (Sharon Stone), and a mysterious military type of team leader (Peter Coyote).  I can't conceive of the government bringing together such a group of private citizens for such an unprecedented investigation, and I know the government would have found out that Stone's character was Johnson's former patient and mistress with a suicide attempt under her belt.  In a matter of hours, the scientists are rushed through deep sea environment training and sent down to the bottom of the ocean.  From their underwater habitat, they attempt to study the huge spacecraft stretched out before them.  They find evidence that the spaceship is actually an American craft, even though it crashed over three hundred years ago.  After finding a huge, deeply mysterious sphere on board the ship, the crew strikes up a strange communication with an unknown, Hal-like entity.  Soon thereafter, their habitat comes under attack by a giant squid, jellyfish attack, and all sorts of emergencies arise that place scientist against scientist in a mental fight for survival.  There is a lot of exciting action as events work themselves out toward a conclusion.<br />The manifestations of the alien entity are given a pretty quirky explanation, and this becomes problematic as events race toward a final climax.  That final climax is hardly a final climax at all, as suddenly the survivors adopt a completely new view of the sphere and of their incredible experiences at the bottom of the ocean.  The movie moved along in fourth gear until the final few scenes, at which point somebody threw the whole thing into reverse; this does nothing and no one any good, especially we passengers who booked passage on the trip.  The whole thing ended up being way too hokey for my tastes, with an ending that did not do justice to all of the work that led up to it.the huge spacecraft stretched out before them.

B0000AOV85|5.0|I like this movie. It's cool to see how all these songs were evolved and the section about &quot;On The Run&quot; is cool. But they never mentioned &quot;Any Color You Like&quot;. I don't get it.
B000001ABD|5.0|Stevie Wonder ~ Song Review is rightly billed as \\"A Greatest Hits Collection.\\"  This is by no means THE Stevie Wonder Greatest Hits Collection, although there are certainly many of Stevie's truly classic recordings included here.  This two-CD collection really serves as a retrospective on the first 35 years of Stevie's career, and I think it serves its intended purpose very well by making room for some of Stevie's less familiar yet brilliant recordings, although the absence of such great tracks as Fingertips Part 2 and For Once in My Life is noticeable.  I consider myself a big Wonder fan, and there are songs here I had never heard before.  When you look at all of Stevie's biggest hits, the ballads are somewhat overshadowed by the funky, toe-tapping, energetic tracks, and this collection restores some of the balance, touching on all of the many facets of Wonder's musical genius.<br /><br />The one aspect of this collection I would question is the arrangement of the 31 songs, as there is hardly any consistency to it, and this gives birth to some odd transitions.  No matter what order the songs are played, though, you will not find anything less than a five-star song in this bunch (even though Hey Love is one of the few Stevie songs I really don't care for).  You get early Stevie frenetic classics such as I Was Made to Love Her, Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours, and Uptight; funkadelic standouts such as Superstition, Master Blaster (Jammin'), Living For the City, That Girl, and Boogie on Reggae Woman; and unforgettable ballads such as I Just Called to Say I Love You, My Cherie Amour, Ribbon in the Sky, You Are the Sunshine of My Life, and Send One Your Love.  The only way I can classify some of my favorites is by calling them songs no one but Stevie could ever have written or performed: Sir Duke, Higher Ground, and Do I Do.  Ebony and Ivory, Stevie's wildly successful duet with Paul McCartney, is a welcome addition to the fold, as are the tracks Part-Time Lover and the exquisitely beautiful ballad Overjoyed from Stevie's 1995 In Square Circle album.  The best of the best, though, in my opinion, are the emotionally striking All I Do and the magnificent I Wish.  If I Wish doesn't get your blood flowing and at least some part of your body moving with the beat, you are in dire straits indeed.<br /><br />I really wasn't familiar with several of the later songs included here, and I am indeed thankful to this collection for introducing them to me.  You Will Know, These Three Words, and Kiss Lonely Good-bye are just exquisite, while the two final tracks, Hold On To Your Dream and Redemption Song, are as inspirational as they are lyrically delightful.  If all you are looking for are Stevie's chart-topping hits, there are other collections that will meet your requirements much better than Song Review will, but if you want a truly representative collection of songs that clearly touches upon all facets of Stevie's wide-ranging skills and showcases his mastery of all manner of song styles, then this collection may be just what you are looking for.  The liner notes, while not extensive, also do a great job of explaining Stevie Wonder's musical prowess, as he is much, much more than a singer/songwriter/keyboardist.exquisitely beautiful ballad Overjoyed from Stevie's 1995 In Square Circle album.

0767827716|5.0|I loved this movie it is the best. My mom named me after it. I thought the movie was one of the best i have seen. I have been looking for a car just like her a 1958 plymoth fury. if any one knows where i can find one please let me know email me at christine_fredrick@hotmail.com. Thank you so much. I think every one should see the movie.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Previously an audiofile, I have recently upgraded my entire system from the pre kids time.  I expect to find some DVD's that engage this $10K+ system.  This DVD does it.  Audio can be set up in 2 channel stereo or 5.1 DTS.  As the front speakers of your system are probably your best, listen to both set ups and simply ENJOY.  Sonically, this is the best DVD I have found.
0783228457|5.0|David Cronenberg is obsessed with technology and body modification - especially how all of this equates to sex and death.  How do things CHANGE us?  VIDEODROME is probably one of his most blatant statements about television, and the dangers of being more than a voyeur.  There is a danger lurking in every scene of this movie, and even the sex scenes take on a disturbing horror vibe.  Graphic and disturbing?  Yes.  But also very thought-provoking, and well-done.  The DVD lets you see the movie in its widescreen unedited gory glory.  Also included is a very disorienting trailer that was produced on a COMMODORE 64!  The performances are outstanding including James Woods at his most likeable, and Debbie Harry as a distant emotionally cold woman who is turned on by the atrocity that is VIDEODROME.  The plot centers on Woods as a slimey cable producer looking for hardcore programming to launch his cable channel.  He stumbles across a show called VIDEODROME that is pure sex and torture to the point of death.  Is it real?  Where is it coming from?  And why does everyone who watches it become a part of it? EXIStENZ is VIDEODROME's bookend - the gaming side of this theme.
B00000DGUY|4.0|What a great collection from Dire Straits.  They're spectacular.  I gave it 4 stars because I can.  I'm not a fan of Heavy Fuel, Local Hero, or Your Latest Trick so I have to skip them.  That annoyance keeps the 5th star elusive.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This CD is good.  I still like Dirrty, and Fighter.  Beautiful got old real quick!  This CD is good, but she is given a lot of freedom way too fast, which makes it kind of a mixed bag.  I liked a bulk of the album but some songs could have been left off.  These songs were Cruz, Walk Away, Soar, The Voice Within and Keep on Singin' My song.  these are bland and cheesy but otherwise this is a good one.  Get it for Get Mine, Get Yours which is a dirty little ditty but has a beautiful melody.  I also like Can't Hold Us Down even if Kim does touch a bit of raunchiness.  This CD is worth it, but if you aren't into her, steer clear
6300274187|5.0|In \\"Mary Poppins,\\" Julie Andrews floats out of the London skies and into the lives of Michael and Jane, two ornery children who desperately need adult attention.  Dick Van Dyke co-stars as Bert, a cheery chimney sweep and good \\"magical\\" friend to Mary Poppins.<BR>In Mary Poppins, Robert Stevenson directs a classic musical of creativity and imagination.  This film, of both live action and animation, is guaranteed to keep a person of any age mystified through all 139 minutes of fun and music.<BR>This film was the winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Actress (Julie Andrews), Best Song (Chim Chim Cher-ee), and Best Visual Effects.  <BR>I give this film five stars because it can be enjoyed by audiences of any age.  It is also enjoyed as much today as it was on its original release date of 1964.  In a nut shell, this Walt Disney Production is \\"practically perfect in every way!!\\"
B000088E6D|2.0|This guy looks nice and he looks young. His voice is pleasant and he sounds vaguely like a number of other singers (Sinatra, Martin, Bennett, Connick Jr., etc.).<br />I have now heard this CD - too many times - up loud! - in my shop. So what is it like?<br />Well, this is a real 'middle of the road' album. Inoffensive and dull most of the time but occasionally it tries to go up tempo it just doesn't work.<br />If you want to listen to this sort of thing - a modern crooning man's voice doing standards in lush arrangements - then you should opt for stylish and experienced singers like Michael Feinstein or Harry Connick Jr.<br />Those two gentelmen do this sort of thing convincingly and with style. What is more, they get inside the music, lyrics and story of a song and bring it to life.<br />Mr. Bubl&eacute;'s disc does have a certain camp/kitsch quality to it - when he sings \\"How can you mend a broken heart?\\" - you can just picture him in a tuxedo (dinner suit)with a microphone in a lounge bar - with a big grin on his face! This is not an 'interpretation' of a song - he is merely singing it! A song like this needs the singer to convince us he is feeling pain and in desperation. Bubbles sounds like he is on an ego-trip - enjoying the sound of his own voice far too much.<br />His \\"Crazy little thing called love\\" - is even more camp than Freddie Mercury's version - if that is possible!!! All style and no substance! Mr. Bubl&eacute; needs to learn, not only how to get inside a sound and feel the words and the music, but also how to pick suitable material for his voice and standards. At the moment, he is merely a superior Karaoke singer and he is awfully young and inexperienced in this style of music. This sort of music not only needs style and pleasant voice - it needs experience, heart, sass, attention to detail, attitude and maybe a bit of life experience!<br />What am I saying??!!! Maybe this guy has a great future ahead of his singing to drunks in Las Vegas casinos!! Wayne Newton can't live forever, can he? (Heck! Give me Wayne any day! He is the real thing!)<br />Don't believe the hype - Bubbles' first album isn't brilliant and it isn't really that good, either. It does, however, have the G FACTOR - Grannies, [and] Girls will (er... may) love it!<br />Needless to say, this recording will sell well and make MrBubl&eacute;a shirt-load of dough. He will become popular and lots of people will suggest that critics of this singer, like me, are being negative and too hard on this guy. Maybe I am, but there are lots of fabulous singers in the world and they deserve the kind of chance Bubl&eacute; has received.can't live forever, can he? (Heck! Give me Wayne any day!

B000002OX7|5.0|This is The Who at their best! They never made a better record, in fact only a few other bands could ever make a record better then Whos Next. There is not one bad track! I know I say that a lot but its true all the songs are exelent, Pete Townshends playing was never better in my openion and his songwriting is at the top of its game! Keith Moons drumming is over the top as always and it never comes to a hault. Johns rumbling bass is a power house here, and Roger's voice is perfect here he never sounded better! The key tracks are of course 'Baba O' Riley' 'Behind Blue Eyes' and 'Wont Get Fooled Again' but all the other songs are amazing as well like 'My Wife' its a hard drivin song about a fed up wife and then there is 'Love Aint For Keeping' which is an easyer listen with great acoustic guitar by Mr. Townshend. 'Song Is Over' is one of the stronger tracks because it starts out as a ballad but ends up a hard rocker its really a great song! So as you see this land mark album is a must own its more essential then Srg. Pepper, Are You Experinced, and yes even Dark Side Of The Moon!
B00009Y3L4|4.0|Cabaret is a great musical with a very serious underlying commentary on the rise of the Nazi power. This is a film to have in your own library and it is disappointing that the transfer to DVD has been so incompetently done. The level of visual noise puts a constant crawling \\"haze\\" over the images, which is most noticeable over flesh tones. If image quality is important to you, then this production will be disappointing.
B00000AFDW|2.0|I will start by saying that I am not a huge Kiss fan infact, I would go so far as to say I am not a Kiss fan in the slightest! I bought this when it came out and I was just getting into music, and I had herd that Ace Frely was a guitar God and that he could play with the best of them, well thats the biggest [joke] I have ever herd! Ace couldnt hold a candle to Joe Perry of Aerosmith or Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin. I also herd that Kiss was a hard rock band well that was another let down. I mean you can listen to this and hear that Kiss is not hard rock. Kiss is the Beatles with makeup, and pyrotenics! Gene Simmions cant play bass for nothing, and that goes for his vocals too. Ace Frelys guitar playing is sub-Par, and Peter Criss is not a great Drummer. The only person in this band with any sort of talent at all is Paul Stanly, he has a decent voice and can play a good rythm guitar. Now I know all you Kiss fanatics are gonna say screw that but lets face facts this band is all about the money and sold out the minute each one of them picked up their instruments. Now to the music, oh the music is oh ever so bad!!! I hate the fact that ever since 'Rock and Roll all Nite' was a hit they think every song must be an anthm. Whats up with that? The only good songs on here are 'Psycho Circus' 'Within' and 'Into The Void' and none of which are something to bragg about. I am a huge Aerosmith fan so I am going to see them and Kiss will be there what is the deal with that, Kiss is a show and Aerosmith is rock and roll, Kiss is setting them selfs up for a big backlash!
B00009ATIX|5.0|A Science fiction movie like it should be: catching, cerebral, intriguing, and opening up inumerous possibilities. Very respectful of the original Russian movie, and Stanislaw Lem's book. Great acting, great directing. The environments that are created are very compelling, realistic, and the perfectly minimalist soundtrack keeps you in the mood. I recommend watching the original and this remake in a row!
B00000ICN5|5.0|I dont care what anyone say or tells you Texas Flood is the best SRV &amp; Double Trouble album, ever! This is in the top five guitar albums of all time, I mean if you got rid of the vocals this would still be one of the best albums ever because of Stevies Solos, and riffs, He is with out a doubt one of the top ten guitar players to ever pick up the damn instrument! I mean Texas Flood has one of the best guitar solos I have ever heard! The same can be said for Pride and Joy. All the songs on this album have amazing guitar, and SRV has an amazing blues voice he really is a talent among talents and Texas Flood is one of the best albums you will ever own in your life. As a great extra treat you get a few bonus songs at the end of the album, and they are live so you get a little extra emotion behind every solo. I am telling you this now if you do not own this you are missing out on the leter-day Johnny Winter, which means SRV is probly the best white blues player in the history of the blues!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|She's still upset that Fox cancelled it. Me, too, but I'm more used to idiocy in high places.<br />But now we have the DVD set--and it's gorgeous. You have not seen \\"Firefly\\" until you have seen it in widescreen and real sound on a large screen (in my case, 42\\" plasma HD) TV. The images are sharp, the effects hold up very well, and the cast is as quirky as ever. Heck, the pilot episode alone is probably better than 90% of all SF films ever released. And, as my wife says, \\"No commercials.\\"<br />Firefly was intelligent, witty, a bit goofy, character-driven, and a lot of fun. Also had one of the best theme songs of any show of recent memory. So, of course, the network executives moved it around, forced the episodes to be shown out of order, then cancelled it abruptly.<br />Imagine if those same executives had been running Fox when The X-Files started a decade ago. All we'd have would be a VHS set of a dozen or so episodes of Scully and Mulder. Bozos. All I can hope is that Joss Whedon succeeds in bringing \\"Firefly\\" to the big screen--and then back to the small one.  ..bruce..
B00006AW2G|5.0|While I may be biased in saying this (since I love the Stones,) this is without a doubt the greatest rock album of all time. There are a lot of greats out there (Abbey Road, Zep III, etc.) this has the greatest collection of songs, most consistent flow of music and can be listened to as single songs or as a full album and be outstanding.<br />If you doubt me, look at the other reviews. This is the finest all-around album from the most potent and true rock band of all time.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I am one of those kind of people that sees a movie and walks out of the theatre wanting the soundtrack as soon as possible. I was easily dissapointed because no store had it and said they only received three the first day it came out. what the heck was Disney thinking when they released this thing. I ran into at least 3 people also dissapointed that the stores did not have it(Best Buy,Cicuit City,Target,and even Walmart) So I finally decided to just order it online here at Amazon. Got it within a week and was very happy until I started listening to it. Where is all of the music? Yes most of the main songs are their but are all mixed up in this catastrophe of orginization. For example,song #1 \\"Fog Bound\\" starts out with a violin that wasn't even in the movie. On top of that #11\\"Skull and Crossbones\\" features the final battle between Jack and Barbossa but is followed by \\"Underwater March\\" when the cursed crew marches underwater and in that same song for three minutes is slow,soft music. Does anyone remember a slow scene in the final twenty minutes of the heated battle in the end? I sure don't and I saw the movie twice. The soundtrack is also way,way,way too short.At only 43 minutes long you feel like half the movie is left out (which is true)On the positive side, the music is great which is why I gave it four stars. My personal favorite tracks are #4 \\"Will and Elizabeth\\"(half the battle in the armory between Will and Jack)Note when I say \\"half\\" I really mean only half the battle music is in there.I also enjoyed #5\\"Swords Crossed\\" and #15\\"He's a Pirate\\".  <BR>So to sum things up the music is great except very dissapointed in Disney for a terrible organization job on some great pieces of music
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Adding to the reviews already i would have to say this was a very interesting story. I saw Neil on this tour, I was expecting to hear the great Neil classics, but i heard he was going to be perfroming arock opera. I thought to myself well if he can make electronc music(Trans), Rockabilly,(Everybody's Rockin), and country(Old Ways)then this should be quite interesting. A couple of songs are a bit to quite, but the others songs make up for it. The best guitar work is on \\"Sun Green\\", the song that tells about the daughter's rise to enviromental activism. Th album also features some memorable lyrics, such as the classic in \\"Grandpa\\"s Interview\\": \\"the only thing good about T.V are shows like.....Leave it To Beaver!\\" Truly great songs with that bluesy strip down sound Neil is known for. The story is like \\"Our Town\\" with messages about the government, capitalism, and environmentalism. For those Neil fans who are already shaking their heads, here is one good thing about the tour. I saw him and after Greendale concluded, Neil and The Horse came back out and did a Rust Never Sleeps revival, includind greats as \\"HEY,HEY,MY,MY\\", \\"POWDERFINGER\\",\\"WELLFARE MOTHERS\\", \\"SEDAN DELIVERY\\" and my personal favorite, \\"LIKE A HURRICANE\\". If you are true Neil fan, you must check out Greendale, while it is not \\"Tommy\\" it is much better than the overmediated pop garbage that is corrupting the airwaves today. Neil is a great artist and should be commended for trying something new, after all he is not trying to be a robot and playing the same thing over and over. That is what makes him great..... long live Neil, rocks original rugged loner.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Simply the best album I ever heard. This was the first album I heard of Radiohead and I simply couldn't believe the music I was hearing. The lyrics, instruments and background sounds all come together to form a masterpiece that will be remembered as one of the greatest.OK Computer made me a Radiohead fan and, in my opinion, this album is the definition and the window of what music will be in the years to come.

B000006OAM|4.0|Natalie Merchant's 1998 effort, \\"Ophelia,\\" is a beautiful cd. Overall, it is a mellow and unassuming record, and though some songs here shine more than others, there are moments of sparkling brilliance contained herein which make it a worthwhile addition to anyone's cd collection.<br />Standout tracks are the moody and ethereal title track, Ophelia, the beautiful and lyrically important Life is Sweet, the third track, Kind & Generous, a pretty song which had some degree of radio play around the time the album came out, and the wisdom-infused track, Break your Heart.<br />Merchant's voice here is rich, full-bodied, enchanting, like a fine wine or an excellent after-dinner coffee. It has a comforting, wise-woman essence, and the lyrics match this in several songs to create quite a beautiful listening experience.<br />These songs in their arrangements contain an element of mystery within them, of a woman artist evoking a soft web around her work, of melody and mood and feeling, which all in all on most songs here works quite well and wonderfully. These songs are not entirely direct. They have a roundabout beauty that is multi-layered, multi-textured, and beautifully resonant. They echo with a feeling of the fullness of life, the bittersweetness of it all.. the good times, the bad  times, the hardships, the joys. But overall, the songs here convey a sense that life *is* sweet, that things often do work out in the end, and that focusing on the beauty and mystery of life and not the pain and sorrow, is the path most likely to lead to happiness and joy, to fulfilling lives.<br />Fans of  Merchant would not be amiss to buy this album. A pretty cd for an evening of candlelight and glasses of wine, for reflection and quieter moments. Recommended.
B000002J03|5.0|This CD is a departure from the debut album. This album takes more of a Rock direction than the first album.<BR>The first album is essentially a blues album.<BR>Again probably some of Jimmy Pages best guitar work.<BR>The CD starts with the classic \\"Whole lotta Love\\" which I'm sure you have heard hundreds of times. Still a classic.<BR>\\"This and what should never be\\" is also good along with the Lemon song which is actully the blues Classic, \\" The killing floor.<BR>They have changed the music an renamed it.<BR>Heartbreaker is next. It features probably the hottest solo of any Led Zeppelin song .<BR>Living Loving Maid is another rocker. One of Led Zeppelins best rockers ever.<BR>Ramble on is another rocker with fine guitar. Moby Dick is a vechicle for John Bonham and his drums. It shows the talent that Bonham had for the drums/ The CD closes with \\"Bring it on Home to me\\" which is blues featurnig Plant on Harmonica. This could be their best album ever.
B00007H1Y2|4.0|Is Ry Cooder still an unknown icon in America? If you have eclectic tastes in music then you could buy everything he has ever recorded and never get bored. Not only is he a talented guitarist and composer, but he is arguably one of the world's greatest archivists, retrieving and bringing to life a wealth of rare and wonderful music that might never have seen the light of day without his TLC. This album is so low key that I was not impressed with the first, second or even third listening. Then something clicked and I have to say I am hooked. There is a wonderful dark discordancy to the music on this CD. A bit like ultra-lounge meets Hawaiian. At times it even gets a little tacky in that 50's chrome and plastic way, but I like that. Typical nice quality playback, a little more forward than a lot of his stuff which often has a recessed quality perhaps due to simple and natural recording techniques.I've never had a recording creep up on me quite this way, which makes it even more endearing. I recommend it, but with the caveat you give it time to seep in.
B000059PQ5|3.0|This DVD came with The Spaghetti Western Collection. I simply didn't relate to the characters as most others seem to have. My enjoyment of the movie was limited by the lack of what I felt was a thoughtful score. Maybe I'm so used to Ennio Morricone's moving scores, as they seem to fit movies like another character. I wasn't impressed with the composition by Luis Enriquez Bacalov, whose music starts the title off. I don't know, maybe I don't care for lyrics. I guess lyrics shouldn't be used if the story is well- told in the movie.<br />This movie is quite dark and opens to some intense beating of a woman. Django is also dragging a coffin through mud towards a bleak- looking town where havoc eventually fills the streets which were emptied by the numerous killings.<br />I would lie to give it 4 stars because the music to me detracts from the movie. And the English dubbing just adds to not help me identify with the characters like I'd enjoy. Other macaroni flicks have gotten me to feel something for the characters, but something was missing here. I couldn't even feel for the woman being tortured (Loredana Nusciak). Yet for a movie like The Good The Bad and The Ugly, I could even identify with Al Mulock's character at the very beginning (the bounty killer whose head fills the screen from a once- empty desert scene). I would give it a very average score and tack on just a smidgen more for the DVD quality presented by Blue Underground, which is consistent with the other nice presentations they have distributed.<br />Tech Specs and Easter Eggs: Region- free NTSC DVD from a 90- minute master print, in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1 (only) and enhanced for 16X9; English mono and Italian mono with optional English subtitles; Django: The One and Only interviews; trailer; movie poster/production stills photos; linear notes; a two- page double- sided pamphlet with more detailed notes.

0805062971|2.0|There were elements that I liked about \\"Fight Club\\", both the book and the film. The film was stylisticly beautiful and the book was more philosophicaly insightful, but if only the sparks of light in the book and film had somehow come together. I liked the idea of exploring masculinity and femininity and \\"feminisation\\" (and especially the gay/homoerotic subtext that was cleverly and subtly touched upon in the film), but I don't see the connection between THAT and \\"project mayhem\\" and anarchy. It went from something that started off as a witty and insitefull look at men and feminism, to something that made very little sense at all.
0451134265|4.0|An early tank warfare theorist, Liddell Hart championed the cause of mobility in the field and rapid deployment.  Largely ignored by the British, his theories were put into practice by the German High Command, which was influenced by Liddell Hart in their plans for Blitzkrieg in WWII.  It wasn't until the North African Campaign, when O'Connor rolled backed Graziani's &quot;grey tide&quot; of Italians by rapid movement, capturing thousands of previously victorious Axis troops, that the British took Liddell Hart seriously enough to put his theories to use on the offensive.  When the Americans arrived, the Allies were ready to face Rommel, who had also steeped himself in Liddell Hart's theories.  The drama of the campaign in central North Africa is, in part, the drama of two sides using different versions of the author's theories.  In &quot;Strategy,&quot; we have the thoughts of the mature man, one who has seen that the atomic bomb can stop a rapid deployment in its tracks, and who realizes that the West's military superiority over the rest of the world will end with the proliferation of nuclear weapons.<br />Nuclear weapons are now available to frequent military rivals India and Pakistan (whose &quot;Islamic Bomb&quot; secrets were recently transmitted to other Muslim nations by one of the bomb's designers), and to North Korea -- which had fought the West to a bloody standstill in Liddell Hart's lifetime.  The old theories of rapid deployment which were the hallmark of Liddell Hart's earlier thought are STILL believed in by many military leaders, ready, as so often, to fight the LAST war over again.  Liddell Hart's too brief comments about war in the age of nuclear weapons are all the more important to us today, lest we find ourselves caught up in an unwinnable war because of poor strategy.  Liddell Hart's conclusions on &quot;industrial bombing&quot; were that it was NOT a useful means of warfare.  We may suggest, based upon very recent military experience, that today's aerial campaign of &quot;awe and terror&quot; rapidly lead's to tommorrow's &quot;guerrila war&quot; on the ground, down and dirty, and very, very bloody.<br />Liddell Hart's chapter on &quot;Guerilla War&quot; helps to illustrate the bloody catastrophes of the Viet Nam era and the current insurgency in Iraq.<br />&quot;Strategy&quot; is a bit out-of-date, but a wise reader can discern where Liddell Hart's theories WOULD have led had he lived a few years longer.  I rate &quot;Stragey&quot; 5 stars, up from my earlier rating of 4 stars, which I gave it before the Iraq &quot;insurgency&quot; showed that Basil Liddell Hart knew his stuff:  the war is unfolding as &quot;Strategy&quot; suggests that it would.  This book is A MUST READ for anyone interested in strategy, whether for playing war games or waging a real war.
B000096FUE|3.0|Narrated by actor Jeff Bridges, &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; documents the failed efforts of director Terry Gilliam and his cast and crew to make a movie based on Cervantes' &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Terry Gilliam, who directed &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, and &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, has a taste for the extravagant and elaborate, but is no stranger to difficult adaptations. He tried for a decade to mount a production of &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;  and finally thought he had succeeded when he secured exclusively European funding for the film. Had the film come to fruition, it  would have been the most expensive film ever produced with solely European financing. As it was, Gilliam tried to make a logistically complex Hollywood film without a Hollywood budget, which left, at best, absolutely no room for error or bad luck. But good fortune eluded the film as one major financier backed out at the last minute, the leading actor, Jean Rochefort, was plagued by illness, and everything that could go wrong seemed to go wrong. Poor planning, poor judgment, and plain bad luck turned the production of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; into every film maker's nightmare and eventually shut it down. &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; traces the film from its hopeful beginnings, through difficult pre-production, brief elation, and eventual demise. This is an interesting look at film production from the inside and an informative examination of the financial and logistical realities of filmmaking. I give it three stars because &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot; looks as if it were made to be featured as a extra on the film's DVD, had the film been completed. The documentary is simply too bare to stand alone as a film. Students of film and anyone interested in learning more about the process of filmmaking may find it worth a look, though. Ironically, Orson Welles tried for two decades to produce a film version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and also failed. We are left with incomplete footage from two different interpretations of the novel.incomplete footage from two different interpretations of the novel.
B000002AGN|5.0|To me, the original Dave Brubeck Quartet, with Paul Desmond present as sax player, is so unusual in that my adored saxophonist and my detested pianist coexisted and stayed together for 17 years. It's a bit like John Lennon and Ono Yoko performing and producing albums together after The Beatles broke out. Listening to the original Bruebeck Quartet albums, for the most part, has always been the mixture of thorough admiration wherever Desmond plays and perseverance wherever Brubeck takes the solo, thus making me long for Desmond's play even more with greater appreciation. It's like Double Fantasy album by John and Yoko. <BR>Take Five is exceptional in that it is the only album that Brubeck does not bother me with his play. In fact, it is this sharp contrast exhibited by lylical Paul and choppy Dave that makes this album so special and enjoyable. I even like Dave's solo in Kathy's Waltz, a miracle indeed. No wonder Take Five has become a masterpiece of the truest kind.
B00006F7S4|3.0|Beck is like a mellower, modernised neo-Pink Floyd in one. He creates soundscapes, his music more about texture and mood than impact. In fact it was Pink Floyd that led to my liking of Beck. <BR>    Sea change is my least favourite of his albums, mainly because it's a bit too slow. Depressing isn't always bad, but on Sea Change Beck is so bummed out you can't understand what he's singing. It's just mumbles and synthetic symphony orchestras, underlined with a drum machine. There are a few high points; Already Dead is definitely worth the price of the album alone, but I wouldn't say this is his best. Worth getting, but the sort of thing you'd play on a rainy day or after a break-up.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I think it's really hard to find a movie where the sequel exceeds the first.  However, THE TWO TOWERS definitely does this, probably because you move more out of the introduction phase and more into the storyline.  For that reason, if you have never seen the first movie and are trying to watch this one first, you are going to be lost.  The story picks up, expecting you to know what's going on and who everyone is.  This movie includes the same characters as the original; however, there is less focus on Frodo and the other hobbits, and more on Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.   <br />Basically, this movie continues Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring.  Gollum soon arises, and despite Sam's detesting, Frodo trusts Gollum to lead them to Mordor, since they cannot find the way on their own.  There is a HUGE emphasis on Gollum as a result of this, which is great because he becomes more than just a figure that wants the ring.  On the other side, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli search for the other two hobbits and later try to save the race of Men, whom Saruman desires to destroy.  <br />There's more action in this sequel, in my opinion.  There's also a person who is possessed/controlled, more of a love story (which I didn't like), and so much more humor.  There are several moments in the movie where someone cracks a joke or something funny happens (mostly about and to the poor dwarf), which I felt added to the movie a bunch.  There are also new creatures in this one.  The ending isn't [bad] either (it isn't a big cliffhanger or anything).  The movie continues to follow the book pretty well, and the additional features, such as \\"bringing Gollum to life\\" and \\"creatures of Middle-earth\\" are interesting.  There's also a 10 minute preview of THE RETURN OF THE KING.  This movie is one of my top 5 favorites (as is THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING).  A must see!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Well i have to say this is by far my greatest cd in my collection. Spanning from his earlier to his later songs, this album has it all.

Amazing.

B00007KWHN|5.0|&quot;The Yes Album&quot; was actually the third album from the group spearheaded by singer John Anderson, but represented enough significant differences from its two predecessors to constitute a new and bigger beginning for the progressive rock group. Guitarist Steve Howe had replaced Peter Banks (who had gone off to join Blodwyn Pig), the album featured only original material, and the songs now tended to be much longer tracks. The four longer tracks--&quot;Yours Is No Disgrace,&quot; &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; &quot;I've Seen All Good People,&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Change&quot;--are structured similarly, although each allows for considerable instrumental freedom. Usually a melodic theme is introduced by one member of the band and then echoed by the others.  Science fiction concepts are combined with folk melodies and transformed into soaring showpieces for vocal and musical instruments alike.  On this particular album the stand out musician is, rather surprisingly, bassist Chris Squire. Sometimes I think they made a mistake on the mix and pumped up the volume on the bass, but then it becomes clear this is by design. Howe's guitar work as well as the organ played by Tony Kaye are given their moments to shine while Bill Bruford's drumming just stays out of the way. However, the defining element of Yes is probably the vocal harmonies, with Howe and Squire blending with Anderson in the falsetto range, highlighted on &quot;All Good People.&quot; It was this that made Yes unique from their most obvious British progressive rock counterpart Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.<br />&quot;All Good People&quot; was also the group's second American single to crack the Top 40 and really became the song that introduced them to a larger listening audience. However, the best is yet to come, with the additional of Rick Wakeman as the keyboard player and Anderson's continued exploration of oblique lyrics.  This is the second remastered CD version of the album and offers annotations by Yes scholar Bill Martin and a trio of bonus tracks: single edits of both &quot;Your Move&quot; and the &quot;Life Seeker&quot; segment of &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; and the studio version of the Steve Howe acoustic guitar solo &quot;Clap.&quot;  These are minor but welcome additions to what was already a five star album.by Yes scholar Bill Martin and a trio of bonus tracks: single edits of both &quot;Your Move&quot; and the &quot;Life Seeker&quot; segment of &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; and the studio version of the Steve Howe acoustic guitar solo &quot;Clap.&quot;   These are minor but welcome additions to what was already a five star album.

B000058983|5.0|Even the cover art is great!  This L.A. &quot;garage&quot; band's third album didn't do much when it was released in the late 60's, but has since been revered as a masterpiece.  It broke new ground at the time with horns, orchestration, up-front acoustic guitars, and no obvious radio hit. The lyrics are often obtuse...totally 60's.  Now it has been remastered for the first time with several par bonus tracks. &quot;Andmoreagain,&quot; &quot;You Set the Scene&quot; and &quot;Old Man&quot; are standouts but the album's plum is &quot;Alone Again Or,&quot; which has been covered often by the likes of UFO, the Chris Perez Band, and recently appeared on a beer commercial.

0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a great thriller that is fast paced throughout never letting the reader relax for a second.  Dan Brown's writing style is perfect for this kind of book.  It is obvious that he has done a lot of research to complete this book, but at the same time he is able to tell a story so well put together with too many twists and turns to even mention.  Though it may sound like a simple thing, Brown knows how to use cliffhangers.  Almost every chapter ends with some vital information missing, so you must keep going to find out what happens.  This is a book that should not be missed.<br />  This thriller begins in Paris at the famous Louvre museum where a mysterious murder takes place.  Two people, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and Police Cryptographer Sophie Neveu, are brought into the investigation.  Soon, they are in way too deep with nowhere to go.  They discover information about the Priory of Sion, a secret group who guards one of the Church's oldest secrets.  I won't give anything away, but this book will make you think about the Holy Grail like you've never thought about it before.  This book has it all; great story, well developed characters, plenty of twists and turns, and so much more.  Do not miss the Da Vinci Code!

B00008CLOA|5.0|Its hard to believe that &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; is over 30 years old but its true. Its a rare that one album can stand the test of time like the way this one has, and has sold as many copies as this one has but when the albums speaks on so many levels and goes places that mainstream music at the time hasn't gone to then people are going to love it. For this 30th Anniversary edition, the band has approved a new 5.1 surround sound mix done by James Guthrie (who worked on the later Pink Floyd albums). This is also one of the rare times where the orignial master tapes have been used for a new remastering outside from the original release and the rushed quadraphonic mix from the 70s. This edition comes with three flavors that any Pink Floyd fan will love - you got your standard CD version which sounds okay but a few times during the album I noticed it sounded a little too loud. Next up you got the SACD Stereo version which sounds fantastic, I don't know why if its from the higher resolution or if its a different remastering but the SACD Stereo mix sounds a little different from the CD Stereo version. But anyways, the main jewel on this edition is the SACD 5.1 surround sound mix - which, in one word, is EXCELLENT. Hearing this in 5.1 is really an eye opener, being able to hear things from noises to the voices that used to be muddled to having a much more open sound enviroment. Those who are used to the 2 channel mix might not like this at first, but give it a few listens its well worth it. Oh - and to those who are marking down this disc yet claiming they have not listened to the SACD portion please don't bother submitting a review since your review is - at best - uninformative.

B000022TSW|5.0|SOUTHPARK is one of those shows that most people either love or hate.<br />It's easily misleading to the haters because it has so much profanity and gross bodily gestures, as well as stabs at anything Americans hold sacred (i.e. Church, liberties, etc).<br />During an interview, the creators made the comment that nothing could be held sacred in this series because that would have destroyed the spirit of their show.<br />The purpose of SOUTHPARK is sometimes satirical, and, this is one of the two levels of the show.  On the base level, we've got the high school jokes and usual crude humor.  For those who appreciate satire, there are deeper levels of meaning.<br />In the movie, the boys are tossed into the whirlwind of censorship, when a Canadian movie throws Americans up in arms.<br />As matters rise, the two countries go to war and it's up to the boys to not only save the two countries . . but, also the whole world, as this war will let Satan return to rule Earth!  Yes, only in SOUTHPARK.  Look for satirical attacks on: how we censor sex but not violence (i.e. in France, it's the total opposite and they have far less violence than we do), Canada, parental neglect towards their kids, kids who get into censored films and even several attacks on Saddam Hussein!!!!

B00005JKCH|5.0|As a kid, I read the SPIDERMAN comic books and, I'm glad to say that the movie followed the thrust of the comics quite well.<BR>Unlike many of the other marvel comics, Spiderman was really a teenager trying to do the right thing, yet still being viewed as a villain by powerful people (i.e. like the head of the major newspaper making Spiderman out to be a villain).  His choices resulted in hurting not only people he loved, but the common man and woman.  In addition, the villains always seemed to have more and be respected more than Spiderman ever could.<br />All of these themes and hard points are also covered in the film, which makes it great for comic book fans.  In addition, to make it marketable we've got all the usual CGI effects, as well as some cool scenes and a popular cast (i.e. Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe).<br />SPIDERMAN was suppossedly the highest grossing film for 2002.  The first movie shows how Spiderman became who he was and details his first set of challenges.  Note that SPIDERMAN 2 is soon coming out.
B000089RVX|5.0|... Amy Lee has the best voice in the world . the cd rocks! its the best cd in the world. they dont sound like LINKIN PARK! dont get me wrong i love linkin park but they dont sound like them . they are very unique and that rocks.
B00000IGGA|5.0|This disturbing and sensational album from artist Tom Waits is pure spellbinding fun! The lyrics are something else and so is the otherworldy music. Something about Tom Waits has me always listening to the entire disc without stopping. He has a refreshing and original taste in design and style. My family always gets a hoot listening to Waits go through different mood swings on his album. The way he depicts sorrow and being alone is so eerie and true to life. Beautiful listening.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Well Let Me Be Honest Here .. The Matrix Reloaded Has More Action .. Yes .. But More Wrongfully Things From The First !<BR>The Fighting Scenes .. Were Great ! But The Despointing  Thing .. Which I Agree With The Others .. Is Zion !! <BR>The Strange Thing That The People Will Die In 72 Hours .. And They Dance !!! That is Funny ! Anyway You Should See It .. Because It's Worth It ..
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I could forgive the convoluted plot were it not for one thing.  Neo flying!!!!?  Give me a break.  This film is an exercise in excess.  The W brothers need to get back to basics instead of the typical let's see what cool thing we can do next.  <br />And the ending, I haven't heard so much double talk since Bush's last state of the union. <br />As far as a middle film in a trilogy is concerned: Empire Strike's Back this isn't but it's not Tomb Raider 2 either.  Maybe somewhere in between. I grade it C for average. <br />Pray that Revolutions will get this runaway train back on the track.
0385512104|3.0|This story is told by 15 year old Christopher Boone who is autistic.  He discovers his neighbor's dog killed with a pitchfork and decides to solve this mystery.  The view of the world through the eyes of an autistic child is very enlightening and well presented by the author.  About halfway through the book, the dog's murderer is revealed and one of the hooks for the story is lost, but it sets up the plot for the second half of the story.  Fear is the major motivation in Christopher's life and he shows a great deal of courage in overcoming his fears.  At times Christopher's ramblings were repetitive and tedious.  His emotional disconnection to the people in his life was disturbing and very depressing.  I was impressed with the idea for this book.  It is an ambitious attempt to understand the workings of the autistic mind. However, the later stages of this story were rather dark and I was relieved to have finished it and to get my mind back to my `normal' life.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie really lacks a lot of action and a lot of needed good acting.  Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson played their roles well, but the rest did not even live up to their Star Wars predessesors.  Natalie Portman plays Queen Amadala and does portray the Queen's love for her people well, but isn't exciting at all.  The little boy playing Anakin Skywalker is suffering from the curse of Skywalker.  It seems everyone that has been set to play a Skywalker has been a terrible actor.  For both of the recent Anakins, the casting directors have taken in lifeless actors that only have one of many qualities needed for the role.  Mark Hamill also was not a good actor.  He played Luke Skywalker of the original trilogy.<br />I have seen the second Star Wars prequal and it was a lot better.  I feel even the acting had improved somewhat.  I only hope that the third will be as dark, funny and exciting as the orginals.<br />Bottom Line: All I can say is that it still needed a lot of work overall. (I give it a C)
B00008NRI8|1.0|One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Just terrible.
B000062YB1|5.0|The year is 1991.  They call the concert Clash of the Titans.  They call the stadium The Cow Palace.  Once upon a time 4 bands named Anthrax, Megadeth Testament and Slayer could come together and fill that sucker full of 50,000 people.  Oh yeah, and did I mention Alice in Chains opened?  Who would have known 13 years later four of these bands would become yesterdays news, and AIC would be played to death on the radio.  In any case, Slayer came on in support of Seasons in the Abyss, undoubtabtly the favored act.  Seasons in the Abyss, like many have said, combined many great attributes of their two earlier releases.  What I like best about this album aside from the guitar work, is the remarkable drum work.  In any case, this one marks a seriously great time in music, that is all but ignored nowadays, but in years to come, is bound to be reconsidered, regardless of how desperately the music industry tries to avoid it.  ....
B00005JLSE|1.0|moulin rouge was a good movie, it was well made, used visual effects as way to get the audiences attention...in no way did chicago do that...it couldnt have been more plain and boring...a matter a fact, ive seen old 1930 movies that were more cinamaticly advanced than this one...<BR>oh yea, nice tracking shots...my mother can push a dolly as well as they did! but i did like the widescreen.......My review...
B0000AI44Q|4.0|The Green family falls apart around their ears and yours in this tale of modern life worming it's way into a small town where family values as clean cut as Leave it to Beaver have quickly eroded away not only it's morale fabric, but also have rotted away the once tight knit families that lived there--in this case utterly destroying the whole Green family in one way or another--with the exception of the one Daughter, Sun Green, Who in the end is driven by all this to take up the fight against the evils of the world. <BR>Or at least that's what I'm hearing.<BR>Quite frankly I prefer the acoustic version of this recording on the DVD over the electric version on the CD. I feel it better captures the emotions of the family and their problems. Personally I would have begun the CD out acoustically and then slowly worked in the rough electric guitar sounds as things with the family started falling apart. As such I rate the performances on the CD as 3 stars and the DVD as  5 stars, giving it a total rating of 4 stars, American bars and all.
6304411448|5.0|The quirky love story BENNY AND JOON was celebrating its tenth birthday when I first saw it.  I was immediately captured; the acting by Johnny Depp, Mary Stuart Masterson, and my favorite, that lovely Aiden Quinn, is impeccable. The story too is so well crafted that the film might almost fall under the category of an art flick.  Watching this funny, imaginative, and satisfying movie is time well spent--so much so that I bought it the day after I viewed it on TV.
B0000640SA|5.0|I can't explain how ingenius the concept of this movie is.  The film starts out with Joe Pantaliano (Teddy a.k.a. John G.) being killed by Guy Pearce.  Don't worry, that's not a spoiler.  The reason it is not is because the movie runs backwards.  The scenes in color are the things playing backwards.  The reason for this is that the real twists of the movie are revealed at the beginning of the story.  I was absolutely SHOCKED at the end.  Really, this movie is a classic when it comes to suspense and originality.<br />The synopsis is sort of confusing within the movie, but the basics are quite comprehendable.  Guy Pearce's character has a memory problem, therefore not allowing him to know who to trust and who not to trust, as he cannot form new memories of people, places and things.  He has to write down everything and take pictures of every person.  This also adds to the interest of the movie.  But essentially, he is trying to discover who raped and murdered his wife, his last memory.  <br />Guy Pearce was phenominal, and deserved a 2001 Oscar nomination.  He really was powerful, conveying a memory problem most people probably could not even begin to fathom having to live with.  Joe Pantaliano plays the &quot;bad guy&quot; very well.  He makes you dislike him, much like he did in The Matrix.  He has proved time and time again that he is a wonderful talent.  Carrie-Anne Moss was alright as Guy Pearce's confidant of sorts.  She basically runs a bar and helps him find John G., the alleged killer of his wife.  I do often notice how she is a good character actress.  I have seen her in three movies: The Matrix, this movie, and one of my favorites, Chocolat.  In each movie she really plays the specific characteristics of each person well.  For instance, her seriousness and love for Neo in The Matrix was just right.  And her extreme &quot;uptightness&quot; in Chocolat really made you angry.  I used to dislike her acting somewhat, but now respect her after seeing more of herwork.  I look forward to seeing more of her movies.<br />Bottom Line: I was surprised that this film did not win anything at the Oscars, but luckily has earned its standing as a true classic among movies. (I give it an A+)
B00000K2UX|5.0|This classic soundtrack is one of the best.  It has all of the original artist songs from the movie which bring the scenes instantly back inside your head.  It didn't used to have the Great balls of Fire song sung by Anthony Edwards (Goose) or the one Tom Cruise sung to Kelly McGillis.  Those songs would being included now have made this an immortal album.  <br />This fast songs album is a great one to have when driving long distances on empty roads as it makes your journey fly by.  The big songs Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins and Berlin's sensational love song Take My Breath Away can be found on many 80's compilation albums but really flow when put together with the other songs on this album.<br />All the songs on this one are great, you don't need to memory any of them out like on most soundtracks.  The lyrics are also included on the cover insert for all of the songs if you like singing along.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Having seen the excellent Richard Chamberlain mini-series of 'The Bourne Identity' when I was a kid (which is closer to the original Ludlum story than this - though that in itself does not make this movie any less worthy), I was looking forward to seeing a more modern take on the plot, complete with contemporary technology and hip young actors. This latest offering does not disappoint - it's gripping from start to finish. Damon in particular has a knack for drawing the audience in to his frantic, frightening world, and this enables us to empathise with his plight. Clever and fast-paced, it still has enough character development for us to feel some degree of emotion for the leads by the closing credits. <br />In the same way that 'Enemy of the State' made us realise how easy it could be for corrupt government organisations to find almost anyone (and eliminate them if considered enough of a threat), this movie shows us how advanced communication technology is today, and how important it is to have the right checks and balances for groups with this much power. This does not mean we come away feeling like conspiracy theorists, as one never really feels that this is more than just excellent entertainment - nevertheless, it is not hard to see the potential for a story like this to exist.
B00005KHJM|4.0|In THE WICKER MAN, an English police officer visits a Scottish island, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl.  The island is home to a fertility-based religious cult.  Rampant &amp; picturesque paganism - of the &quot;Old Age,&quot; not &quot;New Age&quot; variety - deeply offends the devout Christian police officer.  <br />A lot of viewers react the same way as Sgt. Howie when confronted with seemingly gratuitous nudity and musical interludes.  Apparently, people should always wear clothes and only sing on stage, in a studio, or in the shower... not to mention public love-making.  Much of what seems silly in THE WICKER MAN is a natural outgrowth of the subject matter.  The islanders sing and dance and couple with one another, without shame or modesty.  Whereas the viewer can stop the DVD and find something more &quot;serious&quot; to watch, Sgt. Howie must solve his case by dealing with these strangely uncooperative people.  <br />The most interesting character is Lord Summerisle, the cult's leader and heir to the island.  As he informs Howie, the Lord's grandfather banished Christianity and resurrected the &quot;old religion&quot; to make the people happy.  The present Lord Summerisle speaks as though he knows better than to believe in Grandpa's homespun paganism, but one can not be sure that he does (or doesn't).  People raised on small islands, without radio or television, are bound to develop attitudes and lifestyles that we cannot easily explain!  Such may be the case on Summerisle.  <br />THE WICKER MAN is a most intriguing film that becomes even more interesting with repeated viewings.  It's not a study of paganism, but rather a depiction of the conflict between modern and ancient views of the world.  Obviously, we're accustomed to seeing the ancient view defeated - that's why it's not the modern view, after all... which makes THE WICKER MAN all the more disturbing.  <br />This 88-minute version isn't the best one, but it's not incoherent either,and it looks great thanks to Anchor Bay's restoration work.  The 100-minute videotape (only available on DVD in the double-disc box set) includes some expository scenes that help to explain Sgt. Howie's motivations, but with the videotape you don't get the extras included with this DVD version.
6303418287|5.0|While Mary Shelley's novel asks the question of who's the monster and who's the hero, most movie adaptations make Frankenstein's creation to be the clear-cut monster. But Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of the beloved classic is the DEFINITIVE film adaptation of &quot;Frankenstein.&quot; There is no clear-cut &quot;good guy&quot; or &quot;bad guy.&quot; Robert de Niro gives a gritty yet insightful performance as the &quot;monster.&quot; Branagh once again achieves brilliance as actor and director, crafting a visually-stunning and emotionally-charged masterpiece! Branagh fans will not be dissapointed! Grade: A+
B000002NJM|5.0|Tarantino's third film and also a chance for yet another great compilation of music. <BR>This was Tarantino's first time using atmospheric music to set a scene rather than only having music when the characters are listening to it.<BR>All the tracks on this album are worth listening to.

B000008I4Z|5.0|Brave takes a while to get into. I owned it for several months before I decided it was really good. Now I would put it with Pink Floyd's The Wall &amp; The Who's Tommy for a concept album. In my opinion, it is better than both of those. Very deep, very fluid, dark in places. Highly recommend you listen to this very loud with the lights off... but not the first time. Read the liner notes for the background - and listen carefully to the lyrics. Roger Waters should be jealous!
B000002UY5|5.0|I love this album with every part of my body.  I've had it since I was about 10 (when it came out), but i never really appreciated it until a couple of years ago. The melodies are soulful, and the grooves are spectacular.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.
B000099T2L|4.0|I think that this CD is very good. It keeps you interested from start to finish. I don't usually go for rap-ish CD's, but the rap is kept to a minimum and doesn't get too annoying. The first single (&quot;Crazy In Love&quot; featuring Jay-Z) is definitely the standout song on the CD, but the other songs are almost as good as the single. Beyonc&eacute; does her best on the fast and upbeat songs, but the slower songs have cool beats to keep them interesting. The fast songs have some crazy beats! &quot;Be With You&quot; is cool, but gets a tad on the &quot;okay is it over yet?&quot; side. &quot;Signs&quot; featuring Missy Elliott is very interesting, with a horoscopic approach to it. The second single &quot;Baby Boy&quot; featuring Sean Paul is pretty good. It's not as good as &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; but it's still pretty good. The rap doesn't get annoying either. This CD is fun and great to dance to (on the fast songs)! The video of &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; is also very very very cool. I really recommend this purchase, it's one you won't regret! It's one of the few recent CDs that I have purchased! I really think this CD is cool, and I guarantee that you'll like it a lot! ENJOY!!!!!
B0000A1RJI|2.0|Let me say this up front: I have no complaint about the music itself.  I fell in love with the music immediately and rushed out of the theater to find a copy of the soundtrack.  I should have just seen the movie a second time.<br />My chief complaint is with the length of this CD.  It has 43 1/2 minutes of the music from a movie that is nearly 2 1/2 hours long.  I can understand keeping the soundtrack to one CD since $30 for a two disc set is more than most people would want to pay.  What I can't understand is why Disney did not at least fill up remaining 36 minutes of space with more music?<br />I was also disappointed with the &quot;booklet&quot; for the CD.  It only contains a few pictures, a listing of the tracks, and a very juvenile listing of credits.  What do I mean by juvenile?  The name of every person involved with the CD has some pirate sounding name like &quot;Bowspirit,&quot; &quot;Long John,&quot; or &quot;Barnacle&quot; inserted as a middle name.  I guess that some of the few pre-teenagers who chose this over a the newest pop star's CD would find that cute but I dont.<br />I would have given this CD four or five stars if Disney had decided to make a quality product rather than just throw something out on the shelf and not worry about customer satisfaction.

B00009RGBS|5.0|First of all, I think its absolutely ridiculous for a reviewer to say they didn't like this movie because it has murder in it. Daniel Wahl needs to take a long vacation and get the stick out of his behind. I'm sorry, but not ALL musicals have to be happy-go-lucky. I'm a huge musical theatre fan, and I love a happy ending as much as the next gal, but dark musicals like this are FUN to watch if you have the right expectations. Is Chicago the best musical ever? No, and its not even my very favorite show but this movie is a wonderful version if you can't see the stage show.  These characters are not always &quot;lovable&quot; but they are very much human, and they appeal to the &quot;dark side&quot; of everyone. Yes, they are murderers, but if you see the stage version, they don't take themselves seriously at ALL. The six women on the Broadway soundtrack make funny accents and are by no means acting like &quot;cold-blooded murderers&quot;. But I digress. The movie version DOES take itself more seriosuly than the show, but that doesnt make the characters detestable. If we look hard enough, who DOESN'T see a bit of themselves in Velma or Roxie? Who hasn't wanted to perform on stage in front of an adoring audience? Who doesn't love to dance and sing? With that being said, the music for this movie is WONDERFUL and somewhat true to the stage version. Zeta-Jones and Zellweger give (suprisingly!) wonderful performances, as does Richard Gere. They really put themselves out there by (gasp) singing and dancing, and I can't believe how negative some of these reviews are. If you don't like stories of greed and murder, then don't watch this. If you want to see fun, dazzling show-stopping numbers sung by scantily clad murderesses-turned-showgirls, then Welcome to Chicago!
6303014100|1.0|This film was on TV a few years ago and I tried to watch it.  One of the first red flags was Martin Sheen playing General Robert E. Lee.  Egads!  What an insult to General Robert E. Lee!  Robert Duvall was a much more believable Robert E. Lee in \\"Gods and Generals.\\"  And did you know that Robert Duvall is a descendant of General Lee?  Yes.  Click on the trivia facts link on the \\"Gods and Generals\\" page here at Amazon. Duvall even kind of looked like Lee, which I cannot say for Sheen.<br />I have seen some negative reviews of \\"Gods and Generals\\" saying it was too much dialogue and not enough battle.  Thats interesting, since I thought \\"Gettysburg\\" was too much talk, and just plain boring.  And sorry to repeat myself but Martin Sheen playing Robert E. Lee puts this movie in the toilet for me.
0312263120|5.0|This is probably in my top 3 list of books I love. I never wanted to stop reading, each page was filled with excitement and thrills. Although some characters were a little dumb at points it is still an excellent and I reccomend it to everybody.
B00008EY9G|5.0|this movie was great, the plot was fantastic as well. im not gonna explain it to u people prolly becuase someone else did already. Amanda Pete is fine.
6305897786|5.0|It is quite sad that so many people can not get past the need to have everything spelled out for them.  Do we really need to shout the purpose of the mysterious &quot;guardian angel?&quot; Is the difference of the twins really so mysterious? ***HINT*** Look at the illustrations in the book, and draw your own conclusions! The movie is pure Polanski- it has the perfect balance of eerieness, confusion, anticipation, and ambiguity that allows the viewer to internalize the story and bring their own interpretations to it!
B0000A1RJI|4.0|This CD was disappointing in the fact that the ride's theme song that was the basis for the movie was not to be found on the CD. Overall it was a moving soundtrack that brought to mind images of suspense and the open ocean through dramatic rises in the string section and drums. If you like Jerry Goldsmith you will probably like this CD.
B00006690G|5.0|I love this CD, but I only recommed it to people who are Eminem fans. Some people are just too touchy to handle (what is for the most part) a joke. I really enjoyed Hailie's Song, because of the good beat and softer lyrics, which we're not used to hearing from this particular artist. I think Eminem has really proven himself and has shown us what he's really good at in this album and that is writing. He's an excellent artist, the things he comes up with and the way he explains them in his songs are like no other rapper out there. He raps about things that are REAL and sometimes humorus and that's what makes him unique. I give this album and all of his albums 5 stars, without a question.
6305508550|5.0|Peter Gibbons ( Ron Livingston)is fed up with his life and wants to make a change. He decides to try hypnotism, to put him in a better mood. However, the hypnotist suffers a heart attack and dies right before he can snap Peter out of the trance. Now Peter doesn't have a care in the world, and is determined to get fired from his boring cubicle existence at Initech Corporation. Armed with a leisurely new attitude, and a sexy new girlfriend (Jennifer Anniston), he goes out of his way to neglect his job. However, this is where the story gets interesting, because it quickly gets Peter promoted into upper management. His two friends Samir Nayeenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman) always play by the rules. Unfortunately, they are fired due to cutbacks. So to get even, Peter and his two friends devise a plan to rip off the company. <br />This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Everyone can relate to the story, because at one time or another, you have hated your job and wanted to do something about it. The characters in this movie, actually get to live out that fantasy. The acting is great all around. Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter. Everything he does to upset his bosses and neglect his job is outstanding. David Herman and Ajay Naidu are extremely good as well. However Gary Cole gives the film's best performance as Bill Lumberg. \\"Uh Yeahh Peter...What's Happening.\\" He goes out of his way to make the employees miserable, from having them work on the weekend, to stealing poor Milton's stapeler, and moving him into the basement. Jennifer Aniston does a nice job as well. Watching her fight with her boss over the pieces of \\"flair\\" is priceless. The two Bob's played by John C. McGinley and Paul Wilson are hilarious! Last but not least is Stephen Root as Milton. His obsessions with his stapeler and his overall personality will make you laugh and feel sorry for the guy. <br />\\"Office Space\\" is a comedic masterpiece. We can all relate to thestory, the laughs are non-stop, and all of the actors are fantastic. My only question is - Why couldn't FOX put out a better DVD? With how funny the movie was, you know there had to be tons of outtakes, and plenty of deleted scenes. So where are they? There are absolutely no special features whatsoever. To make things even worse, the presentation of the film itself was barely above average. This may be the one time that you should go with the VHS version of the film.
B000002J0B|4.0|I think this is the album that changed everything about Led Zeppelin. They were no longer a blues rock band, but they were now just a rock band, capable of doing just about anything. While that is good, there are some experiements on this album that don't quite work. But I'll just review it track by track.<br />The Song Remains the Same is a good opener, not as good as say, Immigrant Song or Black Dog, but it's decent. I would enjoy this song better it the instrumental parts were a little longer, but it's still cool. The Rain Song is a very pleasent ballad influenced by George Harrison. Nice song. Over The Hills And Far Away is a true definition of 'folk-rock,' and The Crunge is really cool, espeically the made up lyrics. (WHERE\\"S THAT CONFOUNDED BRIDGE?)<br />The 2ndhalf is good, but there are some songs I don't like. Dancing Days is a bland song to me, with really uninteresting vocals from Plant. D'yer Maker is REALLY bad, I can't stand it. Led Zeppelin was not good at reggae. Bob Marley and The Clash were. No Quarter is a great song, even better live. (Check out the version of The Song Remains The Same. Don't watch the movie, just get the album.)Live, the song would go up to 35 minutes, which is insane if you ask me. And the perfect ender, The Ocean, another John Bonham highlight. He IS the song. <br />If anything, this album completly changed Led Zeppelin's sound for the next 3 albums. It's good, but start your collection with any of the first 4 albums.
B00000G3PA|5.0|One of the biggest box office smash hits of 1998, \\"Armageddon\\" was a well-deserved box office hit and sometimes one of the most unfairly criticized movies of recent years. I'm surprised at the negative reviews that I've been reading on here and the low rating of 3.3 (as of writing this review) stars. This movie deserves at least a 4.3 on the rating!<br />Starring Bruce Willis as the disgruntled, often excessively strict drilling expert Harry Stamper, \\"Armageddon\\" is a chilling but at the same time, fun film about a giant asteroid around the size of the state of Texas hurtling straight towards earth, threatening to destroy all life and possibly the planet itself in approximately 18 days and mankind, under threat of extinction, looks up to the expert drilling knowledge of Harry Stamper and his crew of grouchy disgruntled drillers to drill a large hole in the asteroid, send a powerful nuke down the hole and blast the asteroid apart by detonating the nuke. It all begins on an oil rig in the middle of the Pacific Ocean or somewhere around there with the outrageous Harry Stamper playing golf against a Greenpeace ship, and the Greenpeace guys ducking for cover to avoid getting hit by the flying golf balls. It's actually quite funny to watch even though I would lean more towards the Greenpeace people and also Harry laughing at and ridiculing them. However the laughs are instantly ended when a team of government officials arrive on Stamper's oil rig and bring him to NASA headquarters to tell him about the crisis of the approaching asteroid.<br />While Bruce Willis' character Harry Stamper is the main character in the movie, my favorite character is the odd goofball Russian astronaut Lev Andropov (Played by Swedish actor Peter Stormare). His funny personality adds quite a bit to this movie. My other favorite is Rock Hound, with his bumbling and highly eccentric personality and watching him mess up or goof off provides some good laughs. Most of the rest range from good to excellent to downright annoying.<br />The romance between Grace Stamper (Liv Tyler) and A.J. Frost is pretty contrived and could've been left out but that's just my opinion. Most of the negativities are negated by the pros of this movie. \\"Armageddon\\" is an extremely adrenaline-pumping action flick with a highly intense visual assault (in a good way), and a good amount of comic humor occasionally in parts of the movie. Many seem to dismiss this as more Hollywood pap but I beg to differ. \\"Armageddon\\" is just plain fun but also it is rather unsettling because the possibility of being hit by a global killer asteroid is always present but also there is the possibility of being able to prevent such a disaster from occurring. It's for these things that to me, makes this movie so awesome yet scary at the same time. No wonder it was a smash hit at the box office. I wouldn't necessarily say that I highly recommend buying this movie but \\"Armageddon\\" is definitely worth checking out for those who missed it when it was on the big screen. This is just my opinion but man this movie was a brutal, thrilling ride when seeing it on the big screen and when it came to the small screen, the punch was greatly reduced but still, it's an awesome popcorn movie. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Doomsday has never sounded like so much fun.ellent to downright annoying. <br />The romance between Grace Stamper (Liv Tyler) and A.J.

This is just my opinion but man this movie was a brutal, thrilling ride when seeing it on the big screen and when it came to the small screen, the punch was greatly reduced but still, it's an awesome popcorn movie. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Doomsday has never sounded like so much fun.
