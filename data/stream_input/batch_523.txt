0553278355|4.0|In an English class taught by an instructor I can now with impunity call a pompous fathead, I was assigned this book and had to write six pages about what I found to be its meanings. After taking some deep, slow breaths to control my rising nausea at the memory of all the affected, egotistical people who went on and on about the message of this book, I went home and delved into Ms. Plath's (always a Ms. when you're dealing with this woman, she's NEVER Mrs. Hughes, no, no, no) take on her own mental collapse during her years as a college student. I looked forward to this like a trip to the dentist, but within 20 pages I was into this story of a brilliantly intelligent, multi-gifted, crazier-than-the-average-loon young woman from the 1950's, who struggled to live up to the high expectations others set for her, imploded into mental illness, and rose again after a course of therapy that included electroshock treatments.<br /><br />I read through the early pages of Plath's humorous and falsely sedate story of her trip to New York after writing a winning essay in a magazine contest, her life and times as a university honors student, and her concealed revulsion at the man she was supposed to marry. Then the imagined  \\"bell jar\\" of the book's title \\"descends\\" to imprison the young Plath, and she spills into madness. Plath ceases to sleep, eat, bathe, or communicate with anyone outside her own bedroom. Her well-meaning but bumblesome mommy tries to chide her seriously deranged daughter back into good behavior but succeeds only in driving Plath into assuming a fetal position in the earth-smelling space under the house. The seriousness of her daughter's state finally sinking into her head, the elder Plath summons help and Sylvia is sent to a progressive mental facility for a harsh but ultimately successful course of treatment.<br /><br />The book takes us through some of the horrors Plath endured in the hospital, and there are numerous cringe-worthy descriptions of exactly what it is like to experience shock treatment. (Ce n'est pas agr&eacute;able!) After Plath emerges from the center in a state of relative sanity and functionality, she returns to her studies and courageously frees herself from her unwanted engagement. Later, with a MOST unfortunate side effect, she loses her virginity to a professor, and thereafter till the book concludes, broods on the deepest fear of her young life, that the \\"bell jar\\" will descend once again. (Which it eventually does, of course, in the next decade, culminating in Plath's suicide.)<br /><br />Incidentally, in my paper, I took the position of her creativity (as it later emerged) partially arising from her suffering, and that Plath the poet of eventual cult status would never have existed had Plath the college student not endured the pains she did. Oops, seems that was not what Dr. Fathead was looking for, so I got a B. Nope, the correct and only answer for an interpretation of this work is that all intelligent women are automatically societal victims and Sylvia was saying that and only that in The Bell Jar. Unfortunately we can't ask Plath what she meant or indeed if there was ANY theme, cause she stuck her head in a gas oven and forfeited the right to speak for herself. So why so many agree with the victim/poor us message Fathead advocated as the ONLY correct impression to take away from this pre-modern classic defies my understanding, but I still liked The Bell Jar a lot more than I was expecting to and hope anyone who reads it gets to do so with the luxury of finding his or her own take on this unsteady tale of mental illness and survival.ly what it is like to experience shock treatment.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|What I Can Say,well,This MASTERPIECE Should be added in your Collection,Go get this 2 Disc Set Special Edition :P
B000AADYRQ|4.0|With the release of Plans, Death Cab for Cutie had many expectations to live up to. They had their newfound mainstream fame, thanks to those O.C. groupies; there was the booming popularity of their previous album Transatlanticsm, as well as Ben Gibbard's side project, The Postal Service; and finally, perhaps what the older fans are going to be most critical of, this is their first release from major label Atlantic. In stating that, I believe Death Cab had too many expectations to live up to; too many goals to surpass.  <br />Now, that's not to say that Plans is a bad album. Its standard Death Cab for Cutie material, but that's it. After reading several other reviews, I can agree, this album is a lot more mellow. They do seem restrained. There is also that slight Postal Service feel to this album, although I can't seem to pinpoint where it comes from. <br /> <br />#1 Marching Bands of Manhattan (5/5)- A great opening. Just an awesome song all around. Chorus = amazing. One of my favorites from the album. <br /> <br />#2 Soul Meets Body (3/5)- If their was any mainstream influence on the album, this song, their first single, would be it. Catchy and uninspiring, this one was made for those O.C. groupies of indie.  <br /> <br />#3 Summer Skin (4/5)- In my opinion, this is vintage DCFC. It carries that distinct Death Cab feel with it, creating a great metaphor for summer romance. <br /> <br />#4 Different Names for the Same Thing (4/5)- I love the melody to this song, and the way the song takes off after the verses finish.  <br /> <br />#5 I Will Follow You into the Dark (5/5)- Another favorite of mine. Gibbard's voice and a single guitar are all that is needed to make this a powerful track. <br /> <br />#6 Your Heart is an Empty Room (4/5)- I think song also has that familiar DCFC quality to it. A pretty good song, but not a great song. <br /> <br />#7 Someday You Will Be Loved (4/5)- The lyrics are good and sad. The instrumentation flows nicely. I saw a lot of other people favored this song, and its a good song, but not one of my personal favorites. <br /> <br />#8 Crooked Teeth (4.5/5)- I believe Gibbard could have done better lyrically, but I think even with its few forced lyrics, this is my favorite track.  <br /> <br />#9 What Sarah Said (3.5/5)- A very deep track that contains amazing lyrics. While I think the piano is played beautifully in this song, but I think the song would have been better if it stopped right after we find out what it was that Sarah said. <br /> <br />#10 Brothers on a Hotel Bed (4/5)- One of the better songs on the album. Lyrically, however,Gibbard just barely stays on par. To me, this song has a problem of building you up and then releasing you with no proper lead out. <br /> <br />#11 Stable Song (2/5)- A decent song, but I think I prefer the longer version found in the Stability EP <br /> <br />All in all, this album is good. Older Death Cab fans will probably say it doesn't live up to We Know the Facts. Newer fans will say it doesn't live up to Transatlanticism. Both fans will hopefully agree that Atlantic hasn't affected our beloved Death Cab too much, and that they aren't sell-outs like they've been deemed. I concur with another reviewer though - Don't let this be your first exposure to Death Cab.
B000092T6M|5.0|I didn't think we'd get this pretty Extended Edition,I enjoyed it much Sucha pretty Version,You gotta own this Special Edition too :)
B00000ILDE|5.0|This is probably the only case where the sequel followed seamlessly from the original. The story picks up right where Ripley wakes up from her first encounter with the Alien. <br />Alien was obviously derived from an old sci-fi movie \\"It-the terror from beyond space\\"... same plot, updated to excellent and set the new standard. <br />Aliens takes the new story one step further. Nobody bothered to ask 'who/what is laying the eggs?' in the first movie. Here, we find out. <br />Special effects run rampant, but fit into the story well enough to make all of it believable. The plot is excellent and intricate, involving military expenditure of human lives in lieu of the ultimate weapon.  <br />Classic good vs. evil is always the plot... but here, evil has a few faces. <br />Without a doubt, the ultimate sci-fi thriller. One that can be watched over and over and still hold a thrill or two. <br />Highly recommended!
B000286RKW|5.0|I had to buy This Two-Disc Special Edition 'Cause I am Deniro's Fan,I still have The Old Single Version  too,need an advice? Go get this Special Edition :p
B00005JNTX|1.0|I am so glad I rented this rather than follow the advice of most of the reviewers on this page and buying it. I didn't even get past the first 20 minutes. It is truly disgusting. I guess if you are a big fan of this kind of comic book you will love it.  <br />
B0009VRHLK|1.0|I will be the first to admit that my reason for wanting to see this film was because of the controversy over the sex scene and also becaus eof the battle between critic Roger Ebert and director Vincent Gallo that got so bad that Gallo wished that Ebert would die of cancer. A statement I believe he later apologized for. So when I finally got to see the film I was shocked to realize that the only good thing about the film was the infamous sex scene. Not that the sex scene itself was good but knowing that when the sex scene comes on the screen, there is only ten minutes left of this awful film. I don't know what Vincent Gallo was smoking when he wrote this film but he needs to get a better supplier because this film is bad. There is hardly any dialogue in the film and what dialogue there is you can barely hear it. The film is mostly made up of camera shots of Gallo driving along the highway and along city streets. And the camera work is awful. There are lingering out of focus shots of nothing for extended periods of time. I have seen better camera work at a three year olds birthday party, and the three year old was holding the camera. And to make things worse this DVD is a Superbit and I have no idea why. Superbit was wasted on this disc. If you are thinking of buying this film don't. Your money is better spent elsewhere. And if your a huge Vincent Gallo fan....still don't buy it.
0790729350|4.0|This remarkable documentary may actually be better than having been there; you get an extremely thorough digest of the famous festival without the rain, mud, bad food OR the dreaded brown acid. The opening sequences are crucial to the film's success; 23 minutes pass before we see the first act, and the time is spent on an engrossing montage that helps us understand the who, what and where of Woodstock. The rest of the film alternates between the musical acts and interviews with both attendees, officials and local townspeople (whose attitudes toward the event vary tellingly). Woodstock's almost 4-hour length does test one's patience, especially when the likes of John Sebastian and Joan Baez are on the screen; but the footage of Richie Havens, The Who, Joe Cocker, Santana and Sly And The Family Stone (among many others) more than compensate. Director Wadleigh's famous use of multiscreen practically guarantees you'll see something new upon every viewing, and the cinematography is consistently breathtaking; you often feel as if you are sitting on top of the musicians' instruments.<br /><br />This is a bare-bones DVD, with absolutely no extras, not even a trailer. Commentary (at the least!) would be most welcome -- especially from assistant director Scorsese or editor Schoonmaker. But the film itself is still a must-see for anyone interested in American cultural artifacts from the Vietnam Era.
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|Talk about a switch in sound. I guess most bands do this in time, they come out with a number of great albums then shift their sound to typical radio play style. Though, I didn't expect it so soon from 30 STM.  <br /> <br />I have been anticipating this album since the moment they started talking about it. When I received the album, after having it sent to me the same day as it was released, I popped it in my CD player and couldn't believe what I was hearing.  <br /> <br />Things that made this CD a dud to me: <br /> <br />1. All the Anti Copy Crap. I mean let's be real. It was plastered all over the damn thing. It even interrupted the art of the front cover. Fans will buy the music, and people who pirate the music will continue to pirate it no matter what. I kind of expected this from 30 STM though, because a friend of mine went to one of their shows noticed that they painted all the effects pedals black and hid the rack gear. He met them after the show and asked what they used for effects to get that cool guitar sound, and they were all secretive about it and all the guitarist said was \\"we can't give out the secrets of our sound\\". So, after hearing that it wasn't a shock to see all the anti copy crap. <br /> <br />2. The dynamic range of this CD is very limited. The last CD was way more dynamic. This CD was mixed and mastered for radio play. Josh Abraham is a good producer and has produced many great albums, but his stuff is all mixed and mastered for radio play. At least all the stuff I have heard. They should have used Bob Ezrin again. <br /> <br />3. Mixing has many flaws. I was surprised to hear this coming from them. If you listen to the breaks and transitions in this album you will see what I mean. <br /> <br />4. Theme?? What is the theme of this album? Is it pain, emotion, and guilt? 30 STM has to me become a \\"cult\\" band with a \\"cult\\" following, weather they like it or not. Look at their fan base. They are all people who really get into the mars and sci-fithing. They wear the logos and tout the symbols like a militant following. They used to represent the sound and feel of the future of music and were different, and unique in that. <br /> <br />5. Where are the drums? The drums were done so well in the last album. They came out at you and kept your interest level high with all the fills, breaks and the mass use of triggers. The drums are so far back in the mix you can't even tell the interesting stuff. It just blends in. I can't believe Shannon, being such a big part of this band, allowed the drums to be so sad and non existent. <br /> <br />6. Switching to a new guitarist and bass Player on this album I think hurt them. I understand that Jerrod did most of the work on the last album, but switching like they did completely changed their sound, aside from the vocals. <br /> <br />Summery: <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, this album is not horrible by any means. It has just become typical. I have now dropped them into a radio play (3 doors down type band) category. Tons of bands do this, like U2, look at the power and feel of the first U2 albums, and now look at the typicalness of U2. I wish 30 STM had stayed closer to what made them who they were, at least for a few more albums. I think they will gain that radio play type crowd, but they will lose there a lot of their \\"cult\\" type following. The new album just doesn't have the power and magic that there debut album has. I listened to it several times, and I just don't feel like part of the Mars Army anymore. <br />
B00005NKK8|5.0|I enjoyed the motion picture soundtrack to \\"Forest Gump.\\" <br />The variety of music speaks of hope, despair, love, and time passing by.  While events can often seem senseless, they can often end up being meaningful especially if we make them that way.   <br /> <br />The music did a great job capturing the spirit of the movie and I can't think of a better selection for the script.  I believe movies should give us something to think about and this soundtrack does so as well.  Thank you for offering such a great and thought provoking producting.
B000059HB7|5.0|John Wayne is the Sherif, Dean Martin is Dude, and Ricky Nelson is Colorado. Pretty fitting for this cast. Dean Martin sees Claude Atkins murder another cowboy in the saloon and he and John Wayne lock Atkins up in the jail. The lovely Angie Dickenson is the ex-card shark \\"Feathers\\" and she has a thing for the Sherrif. All said and done, this is a classic Western where the sherrif and his small band of compadres have to stave off the bad guy and his cohorts till the Marshall gets to town. A classic Western, and one of my favorites.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I laughed all the way through this movie: Actors die, Monuments blow up, Hilarious music (particularly \\"Pearl Harbor Sucked\\"), Mannequin sex. What else could you want?

In desperation, Ash attempts to escape his horrific fate by battling with the gruesome ghouls with the help of some unexpected visitors. However, he discovers that he is no match for the unspeakable creatures lurking behind every door.Will he make it? <br />Watch this fantastic movie to find out. <br /> <br />I own two versions of the dvd.The original skull cover dvd (which I wouldn't buy because it's a barebones dvd,and it runs about $50 <br />new on amazon.)and the oop limited edition tin,which has the same feature as the special edition. As of now I would recommend that special edition. <br /> <br />This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time along with the other evil dead movies. BUY IT NOW!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I felt bored watching this. I am not sure what all the buzz was about. I love Bill Murray, completely enjoyed the Life Aquatic, but this flick didn't do it for me. Scarlett Johannsen seemed flat, not restrained as another reviewer stated.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|Clapton is one of my favorite artists ... primarily because of his blues background which is a strong influence on his best albums.  With the outstanding recent Robert johnson sessions I was expecting something exciting ... but this isn't exciting or, for the most part even interesting.  It's okay, but not good. If you are a Clapton fan, you MAY enjoy it ... or at least a couple of the tracks. All in all, it is a bit of a dissappointment. Too Michael Boltonish (a little sappy) .... Your mom would probably think this was a pretty good record. I look forward to the next Clapton release.
B00001U0E1|4.0|I enjoyed all the beautiful language and the (contrived) storyline. Gwyneth is so fun to watch. Wonderful costumes and groovy sets.
0060512806|3.0|I've just started this novel upon the emphatic recommendation of a friend whose opinions I respect, and I'm enjoying it well enough, though I'm struggling with the painfully obvious attempts by Stephenson to immitate Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. They say that immitation is  the  sincerest form of flattery, but this is a bit much and do we really need over one thousand pages of flattery, when we already have a Gravity's Rainbow that is a far better story and far superior reading experience? Think of Cryptonomicon as Gravity's Rainbow for Parrotheads.
B00012FXAE|4.0|57 years after the events of Alien, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was discovered by deep space salvagers.  She is brought back to Earth, or at least a space station orbiting Earth owned by the Weyland-Yutani corporation, where she is debriefed by a man named Burke (Paul Reiser).  Board members of course don't believe her story, especially since the planet, LV-426, has been colonized and there hasn't been any reports of alien activity... yet.  Soon after Ripley awakens, a man is attacked by a recently hatched face-hugger.  When no transmissions are sent from the planet for a long period of time Weyland-Yutani wants to send a rescue/research team in, including Marines (Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jennette Goldstein), an android named Bishop (Lance Henrikson), Burke, and Ripley as an advisor.  It takes a lot of convincing to get Ripley to go (she still has nightmares about the events of the first movie), but eventually she agrees.  When they arrive on the planet, they discover that the population has been nearly wiped out by the chest-bursters.  There is plenty of damage from their acidic blood, and the only survivor is a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn).  Soon, an army of aliens appears and starts to reduce the team's numbers to almost zero.  The Marines try as hard as they can to fight back, but the aliens are faster, more agile, and more resistant to bullets than the Marines can handle.  Also, their acidic blood makes using bullets a bit of a problem.  For an action movie, this is also pretty suspensful.  Not a lot of action happens in the first half of the movie.  Basically, the fight is set up for the first hour and fifteen minutes, building the tension up as much as possible until the last possible second.  The second half is the fight, an all-out action piece.  A movie like this would never be made today, too many people would get bored waiting for the action to start, which is a shame.  Furthermore, this is in no way a rehash of the first movie.  In Alien,there were seven people in the entire film and one alien.  In Aliens, there is a large cast, as well as an entire army of aliens.  It is hard to say which is better, seeing as how they are both good for very different reasons.
B000002C25|5.0|yeah, you must pardon me as it is late as i'm typing this, but anyway you gotta give the gallagher brothers a hand for really finalizing their compelling, moving britpop finesse on this album, making it possibly one of the greatest albums of any time ever...only a band like Radiohead could compete with the beauty of this album, if even that, but none of the successful new british rock bands out these days could ever capture the excitement of their time in quite as original and exciting a way as oasis did in be here now...so take my advice, be at your record store now and buy the album for pete's sake!
0553378384|5.0|This is my 2nd copy of this book. When I first purchased it a few years back, I couldn't put it down!!!  <br />     I knew barely a thing about the Nodes and was amazed at the impact and influence regarding Karma. <br />     What I read about my Node for the first time, it was like the first time I had experienced Astrology itself. Instant Awareness and Connection to the Source. <br />     What amazed me the most was how long I had gone unaware of this aspect of the Astrology Chart and its importance. <br />     This book is an ABSOLUTE MUST! for anyone learning about Astrology. Your study will remain incomplete without the knowledge of the Nodes and their influence in our lives.

B000002JS0|4.0|It was the first album released by the Australian rockers in America. The first track off the album has stuck with the band after all this time, \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock and Roll)\\". What always struck me about this one was that it was more of an anthem for a band that had already worked hard to make it; AC/DC were just starting out at the time. They must have known something I guess. It's also one of the few rock songs where bagpipes are acceptable. I love the way it duals with the guitar during the solo.<br /><br />\\"Rock and Roll Singer\\" isn't one of their most popular songs, but the riff is just as cutting as any of their most famous. Bon Scott sounds quite fiendish on the breakdown. \\"The Jack\\" has a great bluesy swagger to it that fits Scott's cocksure vocals perfectly. Yeah, he's just rifling through a deck of cards, but hey IT\\"S ROCK! It's another meaty riff for Angus on \\"T.N.T.\\" The lyrics, especially in the chorus are just plain silly, but they're so devilishly indulgent. \\"Can I Sit Next to You Girl\\" uses a riff that builds and builds until Angus lays down some bluesy licks that would make Chuck Berry proud.<br /><br />\\"She's Got Balls\\" must have been the prelude to \\"Big Balls\\" I assume. What else can I say at this point about the guitar work? You know it's thick and repetitive, followed by a bluesy solo. I wasn't exposed to AC/DC until Brian Johnson was already on board. It was a while before I took a chance on the Bon Scott years. I have all of Bon's albums now. After listening to them I realized we really lost a good one there.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />The album still rocks after all these years even though Angus looks like a flaming goofball on the album cover.
0515123447|5.0|I'm on my 5th Jack Reacher novel.  Lee Child is excellent.  I've been reading them all in a row.  I haven't tired of the same author yet.  Right up there with Dan Silva and Vince Flynn.  Special Forces guys would like this too even though Reacher was an MP investigator, his knowledge is awesome.  Not just braun but brain too.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex and the City - The Complete First Season is wonderful.  All the characters are amusing, funny and realistic.  The stories have meanings and good plots.  The Sex and the City - The Complete First Season is a must have for women and men.  On a scale of 1 thru 10, I give Sex and the City - The Complete First Season a 7.  The only thing that I think Sex and the City - The Complete First Season needs to improve on is a multiple ethnics/races of the cast.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|This movie was fun, I read many negative reviews about the movie from people who expected something more then an action/adventure movie but it doesn't matter cause soon as Alan Silvestri (composer) start with the main theme of the movie (one of the best I heard recent years) you forget all logic and put your legs on the table and enjoy the ride, Hugh Jackman and all other actors are doing their job as limited as they are with their acting skills and Sthepen Somemrs who made a horrible movie a few years ago (The Mummy Returns) come back to form and direct some intense action scenes. \\"Van Helsing\\" will not win any awards, it probably won't have any sequels due to it's small box-office success and it will probably be forgotten in a few years, yet all  of that doesn't matter the fact that I found this movie very entertaining just like last year's underrated \\"LXG\\" (although LXG is much better) and I recommend it for all of you who like good action movies. <br /> <br />Rating: 8/10
B000A3DFZE|3.0|The bottom line is, if you're a Clapton fan buy the CD. If you don't like it sell it on e-bay or something. No, it's not his best but it is a decent effort. Artists evolve, the ones that don't are playing has-been shows at county fairs. Clapton is doing music, that I believe, is a reflection of where he is today. If you want \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" or \\"Layla\\" then stagnate on your classic rock station. If you want to know where Clapton is now, give \\"Back Home\\" a listen.
0767827716|3.0|22 years later, I still have the same problem with this movie that I had upon first seeing it.  The King novel from which CHRISTINE is based was set in a very snowy Pittsburgh; budget constraints compelled the moviemakers to switch the locale to sunny California so that the menacing blizzard which made the book so suspenseful is missing.  Other than that, though, director John Carpenter still manages to scare up some thrills in this tale of a boy and his rather possessive car.  While the reason for the evil car is never clearly explained, one can only surmise that when Christine came off the assembly line, she had tasted blood and therefore has made a habit of taking lives in exchange for her supernatural powers.  Keith Gordon (Dressed to Kill) plays the nerdy Arnie who finds his life drastically changed once he stumbles upon the 1957 Plymouth Fury.  Not only does Christine dish out Carrie-like revenge on Gordon's tormentors, Gordon himself becomes a rather macho man in return.  Ably supported by John Stockwell, Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky and Alexandra Paul, CHRISTINE captures some of the terror of Carpenter's classic HALLOWEEN in exploring terror in rather \\"ordinary\\" means.  While the ending doesn't pack the wallop one would expect, the movie nevertheless is one of King's more efficient adaptations.
B0009SOFFY|4.0|\\"Either you're a fan of Iggy Pop and The Stooges or you're not. I fall into the latter category. Although, I can't deny the raw, underground rock sound that The Stooges helped create on their debut and sophomore albums. With The Stooges you get the original 8 tracks plus the original mixes on the bonus disc that were deemed to artsy back in 1969.<br /><br />With Funhouse, Iggy expands on his lyrical ability; I think these seven songs combined have twice as many words as their debut. The songs on the bonus disc are alternate takes of what turned out to be the final product. As usual Rhino delivers the goods with a combined total of 24 bonus tracks, original artwork, and expanded liner notes.\\"
B0009UC7H0|5.0|No gratuitous sex scenes, no major cursing, a great sidekick, plenty of humor, fair science,  a plot (however implausible), and editing that did not cut out important parts of the story.  It's all here.  I think the stars were well picked and likeable in their roles.  This movie kept the whole family interested throughout and when I told them it was based on one of a series of books, they wondered when the next movie would come out.  What more could one ask for.  I suggest this as a should watch... safe for pretty much everyone in the family.  Enjoy!
0792838068|5.0|The life and times of a depressive drunkard (superbly played by Nicholas Cage), who gradually losses the essential connections with the real world to live the most awful of the thinkable nightmares. A real fall to the depths of the moral degradation and the swampy sewers of the life.<br /><br />This abrupt descend will involve a love affair with a pros (Elizabeth Shue) who eventually will do her best she can for trying to rescue him from his inner dragons but the effort will be useless.<br /><br />A very bold film that inevitably recalls us the eternal beacon in the darkness: Billy wilder 's Lost weekend with Ray Milland (a winner too), Blake Edwards ` Days of wine and Roses with Jack Lemmon (a nomination , he lost with Peck) and finally that jeweled film of the early sixties, Le feu follet (Fire within) with Maurice Ronet and directed by Louis Malle.  To set such tragic portrait in the middle of Las Vegas was a top-notch punch, and so show us the analogy of the contraries.<br /><br />FOOTNOTE:  If there has been a true sense of fairness, this Prize as Best Actor had to be shared with the unforgettable acting of Massimo Troisi in Il Postino (The Postman), who was posthumously nominated. I am absolutely convinced this decision was not well received in Italy and to emend this mistake, years after Life is beautiful was excessively overprized to try to compensate this slip. Anyway, this is part of the story.
B00005176F|4.0|What you read now is a review of a former hardcore Oasis fan. I must admit that I dind't like Blur back in the 90s and opted for Oasis. However, now that there is \\"No Distance Left To Run\\" I must say that Blur had their times, too. And in the long run they outgunned Oasis. They produced something new, something fresh and always came up with some unexpected tunes. Today's Blur is a big departure from their early Britpop roots and they have become a fine indie band with a unique style. <br /> <br />This is a good compilation album that covers Blur's career from their first efforts \\"She's So High\\" and \\"There's No Other Way\\" (my personal favorite) through - among others - the 'Parklife' and 'Blur' albums till their new song \\"Music Is My Radar\\". The prblem with the compilation is that Blur's every album is a world unto itself and it is hard to catch the spirit here. The concept that makes the individual albums glow doesn't come through these songs. <br /> <br />This is a good introdiction to Blur but you have to listen to their albums to really see the evolution the band went through. They made an essential mark in the British music scene. This album has the hits, the other ones hold the meaning.
B00005JSGK|3.0|HATARI is another one of the Hawks/John Wayne collaborations that filled cinemas in the fifties and sixties.  Set in the gorgeous land of Tanganyika, HATARI has little plot but several action sequences combined with the \\"will the hero get the girl\\" subplots so popular in those days.  Buoyed by an impeccable Henry Mancini score, the movie seems a little long in the tooth, but one can't deny the impact of the wild animal chases especially the now classic rhino attack.  Wayne is John Wayne, so he's just what you expect; Red Buttons does his usual sidekick comic relief shtick; Elsa Martinelli and Michele Girardon add European spice; Hardy Kruger as the German hunk and Gerard Blain as the French fellow are appropriately antagonistic/buddy roles; and Bruce Cabot is a sturdy support as the \\"Indian\\".  By today's action movie standards, HATARI is rather tame, but again, the animal sequences elevate it to one of Wayne's last classics.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|The Good<br /><br />The album's first radio single \\"Attack\\" has a great prog-rock style keyboard intro that repeats at various points in the song. Leto's vocals go from subtle to in-your-face, as does the guitar riffs. The lyrics are highly emotional and earnest in their delivery. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is full of low musical valleys and high crescendo peaks, as Jared expresses his feelings about the silly games people in relationships play. The chorus section of \\"The Kill\\" is so entrancing that it simply cannot be ignored. The combination of driving guitars and powerful vocals are sure to captivate you.<br /><br />\\"The Fantasy\\" is lead by a subtle, but effective lick that alternates with jarring riffage. Leto restrains his voice for the most part, but lets loose on the choruses. His brother Shannon lays down some notable drum beats during the call and response breakdown. My favorite track from this album is \\"From Yesterday\\". The song builds and builds with such anticipation that when everything kicks in, it catches you off guard. Progressive elements and watery guitar tones dominate on \\"The Story\\". Lyrically, I think that Leto is giving his fans a little insight to his life.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Jared, you have a good voice, but you don't have to belt it out every single chorus.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Finally, an actor that can rock! Now if I could just name a movie I've seen him in.
0226039331|5.0|For anyone serious about studying the New Testament or New Testament Greek, this is the lexicon of choice.  Perhaps that which sets it apart the most is its thorough references to early Christian literature at the time.  This gives us a fuller understanding of what words actually mean.  Too often we are confined to other examples within the canon of Scripture itself for further light on what a word means.  Here we are taken much further.<br /><br />The very informative \\"Foreword to the Revised Edition\\" and \\"Introduction to the Lexicon of the Greek New Testament\\" are included, and should be read for a greater understanding of how the dictionary works, the history of the lexicon and some tips on New Testament Greek itself.<br /><br />The head word includes the full lexical form which, for example, means:<br /><br />a) If the word is an adjective, the inflection/s for each gender of the nominative case are provided.<br /><br />b) If the word is a noun, the nominative and genitive forms and the article are included.<br /><br />After the (bolded) presentation of the head word, it is presented in a number of important forms.  These are either the 1st person singular of different tenses/moods of the verb paradigms or commonly used forms.<br /><br />Because of the fullness of the material and the need to save space, many abbreviations are used.  It is worth familiarising oneself with the abbreviations by skimming over the \\"Composite List of Abbreviations\\" page LIXff before dipping too far into your work.<br /><br />Possible improvements:<br /><br />1) Mounce's categorisation of each word into a given code is quite well known and widely used (these can be found in his Basics of Biblical Greek, Analytical Lexicon and Morphology of Biblical Greek).  It would be a great future improvement of BDAG to include these codes alongside each entry.<br /><br />2) The font used makes kappas and rhos look funny and I personally need to look at a word twice at times in order to be able to tell what it is.  A less cursive-style font would look better in future editions.<br /><br />3) Little/no use is made of the front and back inside cover or back of the book.  The back has some sample entries, which, while handy for a bookstore who may want to seal the book to maintain its good condition, it is a bit of a bore to someone who has owned the lexicon for some years.  It would be better to include something worth memorising or a few quotes scholars have made about the dictionary itself.<br /><br />If looking this book up in your library catalogue or any online resource, please note that it will not necessarily help to type in what it is commonly known as - BDAG.

B00008PC2O|5.0|This sequel is by far, much more complex, fascinating and terrific than the first one. The engrossing and inevitable between the man and the machine is cynically remarked through apparently simple narrative devices (for instance, the use of Atari -a machine to fake another machine - and get some money; the simulated War games in the Gallery moments before T 1000 makes his appearance; the pleasant moments in which our future hero young boy tries to advise his mentor machine, that not all human being must be exterminated, the hard explanation about what feelings mean, the funny twists of words in search perhaps of his missed future father).<br /><br />The future against the fate!<br /><br />The impressive opening sequence, in which we watch the mechanic foot flattening the brain's skull, (suggesting a clear statement about who is the master) of the bloody Battle between men and machines is visually stunning.<br /><br />The undeniable and superb employment of EFX , makes of this last device another invisible actor. There are many breathtaking chases, and the double final battle keeps for you a clever message; the machine against the human race, exterminating any possible trace about developing the future technology that will produce the abominable cyber generation. The perspective of the viewer is cleverly twisted , but imagine you change of vision angle and  ignoring all the futuristic dramatis personae to come. They would be a terrorist sect trying to avoid the ineffable progress. On the other hand we have the final confrontation between both machine generations, but the game has ended and the final resolution is a true hair raising battle in the middle (once more the underground irony) of an industrial stage. The elevated temperature of these furnaces permit through the melting process the transformation of solid metal into liquid metal, and that 's another winner premise.  The only way to face and win is reversing the process and make the liquid metal - the support structure of the new generation returns to its origin. Fire extinguishing the fire and both machines will find themselves in that melting cemetery. One of them obviously will die violently while the other will decide as a juggernaut: the mission is done: welcome the future with its virtues and faults.<br /><br />A superb triumph and one of the most original films of he Decade.the new generation returns to its origin.

B000000WZ4|5.0|This is a welcome comeback from Depeche Mode with some of their best songs in a decade. It is a far departure from their earlier albums but this time they managed to make a good turn and rely on what they know best. Dave Gahan is back here from his private hell and sounds better than ever. The usage of gutiars and other 'enchancments' is absolutely reliable here while it was not on their earlier albums. The fusion is perfect. <br /> <br />About the songs: there are no fillers, highlights are the singles released (Barrel Of a Gun, It's No Good, Home, Useless), but my favorite song is Sister Of Night. It reminds me of Waiting For The Night from Violator. There are some instrumental tracks as well (this is a Depeche Mode album after all). My other favorite song is Home, I can't tell you how many times I listened to that song on cold, lonely winter nights and it always gave me a warm touch. <br /> <br />So if you were disappointed by DM's 90's tries, you should listen to this album, this time the guys managed to bring back the sound that is the trademark of the band. Great album.
B0000033OZ|1.0|The analog source for some selections is very poor, likely very heavily filtered, seriously lacks fidelity.  The CD only contains the front side of the original record.  The back side of the original record was exceptionally excellent, and it's disappointing that it was not included.
B0009SOFGI|4.0|\\"Either you're a fan of Iggy Pop and The Stooges or you're not. I fall into the latter category. Although, I can't deny the raw, underground rock sound that The Stooges helped create on their debut and sophomore albums. With The Stooges you get the original 8 tracks plus the original mixes on the bonus disc that were deemed to artsy back in 1969.<br /><br />With Funhouse, Iggy expands on his lyrical ability; I think these seven songs combined have twice as many words as their debut. The songs on the bonus disc are alternate takes of what turned out to be the final product. As usual Rhino delivers the goods with a combined total of 24 bonus tracks, original artwork, and expanded liner notes.\\"
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew after his baby brother came home and wished I had found it and given it to him before the baby came.  Excellent illustrations and wonderful, easy to understand text.  A great preparation tool for a new sibling.
B00079FUI6|1.0|Tried to watch this show again, but honestly people, I just don't get it. Why the hell is this show so overrated and hyped? Why is this show called a comedy and satire when it isn't a satire, and the women AREN't funny? The women aren't that pretty, definitely NOT sexy, and their characters are boring as hell (and I know they're housewives, but can't these women at least have intelligence, common sense, some cultural interests, or something?). And as hard as this show tries to add suspense with suicides and now a locked up guy in a closet on season 2, it seems to be nothing more but a big publicity tactic. For the most part, the show and the female characters barely even focus on those issues and instead focus on how desperate these people are at making their lives more miserable and ridiculous. If it comes to a point when the producers of this show are just as desperate as the characters (i mean seriously, aren't these women ever OUT of character when they aren't on the show?), then it goes to reveal that this is nothing more but one huge, overrated soap opera with a few laughs here and there. If you find it entertaining, nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't make it the best show of all time. Sometimes I wish people will get a grip and stop acting like it is.
0553812173|4.0|Alright, Id like to chip in here with some words of praise  and a few words of warning.<br />First - What this series is most like: <br />This is a series which is a monumental extrapolation and expansion upon the themes in the dark military /high-powered fantasy of Glen Cooks The Black Company series.<br />So thats where your expectations should be. This is not a character study Fanthistorical. This is The Black Company Redux. It is most assuredly not Song of Ice and Fire, Revisited.<br />Second - Who Erikson is and isnt:<br />1 - No  Steven Erikson is not as good a writer as GRR Martin  and its not even remotely close so lets not even pretend, okay? I liked this series too  but lets not get carried away.<br />2 - No  Erikson is not a good a writer as S.R. Donaldson.  His world building and character focus is nowhere near that. Erikson is about the story &amp; the action.<br />3  Maybe hes a better writer than Jordan and maybe not; that is a matter of taste. I think its fair to say that he is a better story teller than Jordan in many ways and certainly a better action writer (but that comes at a cost of character development).<br />4- Yes  Erikson is a better writer than Terry Goodkind.  Goodkind is not in Eriksons league.  They are both fantasy authors of the nineties and early 21st century and are fat fantasy fiction authors, but the similarity ends there. <br />5  Erikson =  Glen Cook with a little less humor, faster typing skills and slightly more imagination.<br />6  Yes  there are gaming fiction elements to this world. Erikson is/was a gamer and at times it shines through. <br />Third  So Is it any Good?<br />Yes. I think the series is interesting and very good, but it is not for everybody.  Erikson has made several choices in this series which effect how the reader comes to it. Heres the bullet points:<br />1  Shades of Grey: Extrapolating upon Glen Cooks The Black Company, there really are no good guys and bad guys. They are mostly all bad guys with only a few white hats thrown in.  <br />2- Erikson is about the story:  Because Erikson is about the story, he introduces a vast number of characters to the reader. Unfortunately, because Erikson is in such a damned rush to move his story along, there is a lot of time spent on the character's *role in the plot* and not much time spent on character development *as a person*.  Consequently, while the characters become likeable and each has a cool factor all their own  you dont really get attached to any of them. <br />3 - Minimal Exposition: Eriksons world and magic system are deep and interesting, but Erikson has decided that for the most part, hes not going to be expository about any of it. You are thrown into this world and you have to puzzle it out as you go along.  For a lot of readers, this is going to be frustrating because Erikon deliberately chooses not to explain things for you in the way most fantasy authors do. <br />4- High Power Action: Ive read a lot of fantasy fiction, but nothing that compares to the power level thrown around in these books.  Its all over the spectrum  gritty soldiers, thieves and saboteurs mixed in with god-kicking sorcerers, Archmage-assassins and uber_mortals and demi-gods. While the feel is deliberately very grim and gritty  the power level is high and frequently  epic in gaming terms.  The nice thing is  - Erikson pulls this off very well. That's a big plus.<br />Overall - If you like Glen Cook, groove on themes exploring the underdog military guys who have to outsmart the badasses, think the Ten Who are Taken were cool villains and find city-busting  levels of power to be interesting to read about, enjoy complex plots and intricate treachery - this series is for you.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|I'm a huge Pat Metheny fan.  I own almost all his stuff, have seen him in concert three times and am going again in October.  I'll confess right up front that my reaction to this album is at least in part due to the interview on NPR's Talk of the Nation in June.  Pat claims his new recording is a response to the \\"dumbing down\\" of pop music.  This project is a long-form piece in 4 parts that requires focus and a little work to listen to and get familiar with.<br /><br />Gimme a break, will you, Pat?  There is a tremendous amount of great stuff by talented artists happening out there in pop music.  Sure, some of it is dumb, but that's been true ever since pop/rock came into its own in the 50s.  There's a lot of crappy jazz out there, but that doesn't mean that jazz as a genre is \\"dumbed down.\\"  I just don't buy this whole \\"the culture is going to pot\\" stuff.  Pat, sometimes you really sound like an elitist (ie., SNOB).  I lost patience with that kind of thing a long time ago.<br /><br />So, having said that, what you have here is a basic Pat Metheny Group record.  To my ears it sounds like an extension of \\"Imaginary Day\\" and \\"Speaking of Now.\\"  Perhaps I just haven't WORKED at it enough, but I don't hear a whole lot of thematic connection between the parts and the various subsections of this supposedly unified composition.  It sounds to me like about 13 or 14 different compositions with transitions to tie them together.  There are some great moments here, nothing ground breaking.<br /><br />Is it worth buying?  Yes, if you're already a fan.  If you're just newly checking out Pat, try \\"Still Life Talking\\" or \\"Letter from Home\\" or even \\"Speaking of Now.\\"<br /><br />Pat, I buy your recordings to listen to your brilliant music.  I don't need to be taught a lesson by you.  It feels a bit like hearing Hollywood stars make political commentary.
B00000K2UX|5.0|In the summer on 1986, a plucky little movie titled Top Gun soared into the movies theaters and into our hearts. By today's standards the movie's pretty tame, but back then you and your friends were calling each other Maverick and Goose and dreaming of going to Top Gun school to fly an F-14 fighter jet. My memories a little hazy about the specifics of the film, but who could forget its hit cast of Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Anthony Edwards, and that short guy there. You know the one that lip-synched in his underwear in Risky Business. What the hell was his name? Just as impressive as the cast, was the movies soundtrack. It seems that back in the eighties movie soundtracks were always packed with hits. Maybe it was because when an artist did a song for a movie, they didn't release it on their own album too.<br /><br />Okay, looking back a \\"Danger Zone\\" I do have to admit that it's really cheesy. Back then though, Kenny Loggins was the man. He was the coolest, bearded, middle-aged man with a leather bomber jacket in rock music. The pulsing synth intro sucks you in while the arena rock guitars illicit images of the jets taking off from an air craft carrier. The piercing guitar riff with have you mimicking along on air guitar. I didn't even realize that it was Cheap trick that sis the power-pop anthem \\"Mighty Wings\\". I think this one played during the closing credits. The high-energy, synth heavy, melodic track just sends you on an emotional high. The lost Kenny Loggins hit \\"Playing with the Boys\\" appeared during the volleyball scene I believe. This track is driven by percussion and Loggins powerful voice.<br /><br />\\"Take My Breath Away\\", which was recently butchered by Jessica Simpson, was the quintessential love song of the mid-eighties. Sadly it turned a rather racy rock group into sappy balladeers; and alas, one-hit-wonders. Miami Sound Machine was just starting to break when the contributed \\"Hot Summer Nights\\". The sing is loaded with their trademark Latin rhythms and Gloria's smooth vocals. There's more than one sappy ballad on this soundtrack. Loverboy's \\"Heaven In Your Eyes\\" starts with a synth/vocal verse that concludes with a power chorus. An ominous church bell signals the beginning of the \\"Top Gun Anthem\\". Fuzzy guitars and an edgy guitar lick is laid down over pre-programmed drum tracks. A few years back they released a Special Extended Edition of the soundtrack that included five more songs from the movie; to include \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Top knotch soundtrack with hits galore. Now where's my flight jacket?and Gloria's smooth vocals. There's more than one sappy ballad on this soundtrack.

0141000198|5.0|This delightful book, written in diary form, follows a hectic and very funny year in the life of Ms Bridget Jones, 30-something English Singleton.  Bridget obsesses constantly about her weight and unmarried state, and as the year begins, she also obsesses about her playboy boss, Daniel Cleaver.  They flirt madly and have an on-again, off-again relationship, but he is a commitment-phobe (and a bounder!).<br /><br />All through the year, Bridget's flighty mother, Pam, tries to pair her up with successful barrister, Mark Darcy, but Bridget will have none of it.  As the year comes to a close, however, Pam's legal woes bring Mark to the rescue, and the diary ends on a happy note.<br /><br />Every page is filled with situations and emotions that all women who have dated, dreamed, been disappointed, and found solace in ice cream will find utterly hilarious.  Bridget's  descriptions of daily exasperation, desperation, and moments of sheer bliss make her very likeable and real.  The short diary entries make this book perfect for reading when you just have a few minutes, although you'll find it hard to put down, and may find yourself laughing out loud (a lot).<br /><br />Kona

B00000AFDW|4.0|I had long given up on these egotistical porn rockers. It was a surprise. They captured some of that great Kiss magic on this cd and I'm sure it was because Ace and Peter were back. Great songs include the title track, Into the Void, We are one, Within, and the wonderful Journey of 1000 yrs. Great to see that Simmons concentrated on the music here instead of the bulge. He sounds inspired- haven't really heard that since Creatures. The sound and atmosphere are back in this cd.

B0001GMIOE|5.0|Before you buy a generic battery pack, first consider how many times you'll want to use it before it becomes useless. The generic battery I bought doesn't hold much of a charge after a dozen uses. Also, double check the voltage and capacity (mAh) of the generic, often times they're cheaper because they're underpowered and have less capacity. For my money, the reliability of the Canon BP511A is well worth the premium (I've been using the original for over a year now).

B0000028UK|5.0|I'm something of a new Pearl Jam fan. I have their first four albums and I'll be getting Yield soon enough. Of the four I own my favorite song ever comes off Vs. and this is my favorite PJ CD. Maybe that'll change with Yield but right now I can only speak of the present. <br /> <br />Back to my favorite song of not only the CD but anything I've heard. That honor would go to Rearviewmirror. No matter how many times I listen to this song it gives me the chills at the climax. The funny thing is I'm big on guitar solos and this song actually doesn't have one. It seems like a rather simple song but there's real beauty here. Eddie builds up the song and right around the last half of it he just explodes and I feel the goosebumps pop all over my arms. <br /> <br />Aside from that song there's much more good stuff on here. The only one I have a habit of skipping is Rats because it's just kind of quirky and I only listen to it when I have time. This album really builds off of what they did in Ten and you can see how they started changing here. Eddie does an excellent job and Mike has those memorable solos. Another one of my favorite songs in Leash. Probably the hardest song they've done and I can't get enough of it. The last song, Indifference, is a really strong slow song that can grip your heart if you are in the right mood. <br /> <br />Basically, if you enjoyed Ten you need to pick this up and continue your Pearl Jam journey. If you are looking for a first CD I suggest going in order and starting with Ten. This CD is top notch and bands nowadays should take note in how to evolve your music and not become static.

B0001AP158|1.0|How disappointing... Just finished watching the DVD. Bon Jovi was one of my favorite bands when I was a teenager. On this DVD, I could BARELY recognize the songs I sang when I was a kid. Boy, what did they do to the songs?! The interpret them all as jazz/acoustic/folk versions, and, trust me, I love jazz and folk and these are not good jazz/folk interpretations. I still love the band but I completely dislike what they did to their hits. I wish I had not bought it in the first place. I will probably look at some other concert DVD from them, that will stick to the original version and sell this crap or use it as a cup holder.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|First off, I want to say that I wasn't a huge fan of these guys when I first heard them several years ago, but when this album came out in June and I picked it up, I was simply blown away. I'm not sure even what I could say about this CD that would do it any sort of justice, except for the fact that this is one of the best CD's in any sort of musical genre that's been released this year. I saw Avenged Sevenfold on the Warped Tour this year, and after going I would highly recommend seeing them to anyone who likes watching actual musicians who have passion for what they do. Personally, my favorite song on City of Evil is \\"Seize The Day\\", but by saying that I am in no way trying to say that the rest of the album is sub-par to that track in any way. Every track is killer and will blow you away if you love guitar solos, melody, and top-notch musicianship. Every time I listen to this album there is something new in one of the songs that I pick up on that makes me appreciate this band even more. Avenged Sevenfold is an amazing band and anyone with ears that likes heavy music should buy this CD, cos I can almost guarantee you that you won't be disappointed. \\"City of Evil\\" is a modern classic and should be heard by as many people as possible. And to all you people who are critical of this band for one dumb reason or another, I hope you and your bad taste in music burn in hell.
0783222955|5.0|The movie is a classic, and even though it is in black and white, its authenticity to the book, except in just a few details, adds to its <br />significance.  <br /> <br />The director of the movie took the liberty to put Scout in a papier mache hard cased ham costume, while in the book she was in a chicken wire and cloth costume, which added to the danger when she was attacked by Mr. Ewell. The wire was flexible and hard on the skin. Also, in the final scene in the movie Boo was hidden by the door, whereas in the book he was just in the corner and visible to all. <br /> <br />Robert Duvall played an excellent Boo in his debut role. Gregory Peck was a precise and perceptive Atticus Finch. The actor who played Tom Robinson recently died, but gained fame in his role. It is interesting to note that the character of Dill was patterned after Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote, in her own words. <br /> <br />While she spent four years writing the novel, which eventually earned the Pulitzer Prize, her audience and readers have enjoyed many years enjoying not only the book, which is one of 130 banned books because of the exposure of racism, but also the movie.

His vocals are that of an Andrea Bocelli and he's amazing. The music is beautiful and calming and puting his voice to the music makes this cd something almost anyone can appreciate. <br />
B00006WKSZ|4.0|For those who may believe that POLAR NIGHTS is completely absent from the Scorpions CD catalog due to these reactionary reviews, do not fret. They simply removed this track from \\"Tokyo Tapes\\" running order in an effort to make the entire release fit on a single disc. They then added \\"Polar Nights\\" as a bonus track on the \\"Taken By Force\\" remaster along with a studio version of \\"Suspender Love\\". <br /> <br />Get them both, they are must have releases for any Scorpions fan.
B00003CXA2|5.0|He's always been my favorite actor, but I honestly never saw this movie until last night. It was phenomenal, to say the very least. The filming was outstanding, as was Gary Sinise as \\"Lt. Dan\\". With lessons to be learned you'll never forget, I wholeheartedly reccomend this.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|the photom of the opera is good movie i didn't think i was going to like it but i did. the guy they ppicked for the phatom is not how imagined him but he was very good. i was a little confused with the flashback between \\"past\\" and \\"present\\"  and the ending is a little sad but overall i realy enjoyed the movie
B00005JNSK|5.0|Taken strictly on its own merits, this film is extremely entertaining.  While Burton clearly revels in special effects & Danny Elfman enjoys flexing his versatile musical muscles, neither of these things gets in the way of a story well-rendered and well-told.  The movie moves briskly to its climax, so much so that the viewer may be surprised at how quickly the time has passed.<br /><br />For those who absolutely ripped this movie because it was not a carbon copy of the 1971 Gene Wilder version --- it isn't a remake, anymore than the assorted versions of \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" could be considered remakes of earlier film versions.  It is a reinterpretation of what was already a classic work of fiction, and for my money, it is far superior in staying true to Dahl's vision.  So you miss the Oompa-Loompa song, plus all of the other ditties from 1971?  Too bad --- watch the original if it means that much to you.  Burton's version contains none of these songs, but instead takes the novel approach of relying on Dahl's original lyrics (always crucial in any of his books), so conspicuously absent from the 1971 version. For those critical of Burton's inclusion of a storyline not in the original, it pales in comparison to the numerous 1971 deviations.<br /><br />Certainly Burton's production values absolutely blow the earlier version out of the water, yet they don't seem to get in the way of telling the story.  Too many movies get caught up in the special effects to the point that they tend to bog down a movie that they were intended to enhance.  Burton is able to avoid this trap.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, true to form, nails his performance of an eccentric man-child whose weirdness is obvious yet difficult to pinpoint.  Depp's Wonka makes the adults uncomfortable without being off-putting, yet for all of his innate childishness, is also unable to relate to the assorted brats that cross his path during the tour of the factory.  Depp's Wonka seems to be an interesting amalgam of Ed Wood, JM Barrie & Edward Scissorhands, but remains a strikingly original character despite hints of these earlier roles.<br /><br />Deep Roy absolutely cracked me up in ways that the barely mobile 1971 Oompah-Loompahs never could.  Obviously the advances in technology made it possible for the Oompa-Loompas to be much more versatile in their songs & rountines, and I found them to be consistently entertaining.<br /><br />The various children, in particular those playing Charlie and Veruca Salt, were utterly convincing in their roles.  The boy playing an updated (but all too relevant) version of Mike Teavee makes his character simultaneously fascinating & frightening.  Not enough can be said in praise of the delightful David Kelly (best known from his role in \\"Waking Ned Devine), who steals virtually every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />It should be noted that this is by no means a childrens' film.  The screening I attended featured an approximately 3-year-old child whimpering in terror as the squirrels dragged Veruca Salt to the garbage chute.  Other children in the audience that were under the age of 10 seemed to respond only to the occasional moments of slapstick involving Willie Wonka and the glass elevator.  Significant portions of the movie will be completely over the heads of most children, no matter what their ages.  Of course, for the adults, there are endless moments of wry humor to appreciate.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.  In time I suspect that the 1971 version will be relegated to the shadows, and Burton's vision will stand alone, unchallenged.d Wood, JM Barrie & Edward Scissorhands, but remains a strikingly original character despite hints of these earlier roles. <br /> <br />Deep Roy absolutely cracked me up in ways that the barely mobile 1971 Oompah-Loompahs never could.

B00009YNJU|5.0|Just to inform the people who want to buy this CD, it is the Japanese Version, the only difference to the US version is the text written in the sleeve of the CD. There is nothing added to the music of this CD (big disappointment) but it is still a gorgeous soundrack!
0446677450|4.0|A lot of generalities; very little specifics.  He keeps referring to how he made money (foreclosures) but also mentions that this method is dated and no longer available.  Takes the naiive approach of \\"make your investments first; pay your bills later\\", with the assumption that you'll somehow find a way to pay the bills. <br /> <br />Interesting advice, but misses the point that some of us find happiness without being filthy rich. <br /> <br />
B000002IO1|5.0|I ordered this not thinking that it would reach me before my class reunion and it actually made it to me a day before it.  From date of order 7/25, I received it on 7/28.  Excellent!  THanks so much.  I will definitely keep you in mind for future purchases!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The 1st time listen through gave me about 3-5 immediate favorites.  And the more I listened the deeper the music got, and is worth the ticket price.  Worth while tracks are The Package, Pet, Blue, The Noose, and differently The Nurse Who Loved Me.
0684823454|4.0|Definitely a good read!  Churchill recounts his early years with subtle wit and elegant style.  Even the battle scenes kept me interested, which was an unexpected surprise.  A good view into the life of a middle-class British soldier before the World Wars.
B0009XT8YW|1.0|I got this to put on my iPod, shame this crummy disc can't be put on your own devices for your own, personal pleasure! I hope this puts a few pepole off buying this disc, another triumph for the greedy music industry!!! I'm afraid my blood pressure will rise every time I hear it so I won't be playing it!!
B0000AQZYM|5.0|we have dvd version of the movie and wanted the vhs.  My wife loves animated movies.  So I purchased it for her.  She is in most of the Disney movies especially animated ones.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is classic system.  The songs rock and the lyrics are out there. The band's feeling on many relivant subjects are made known but in a way that you dont want to stop rocking because you might not see thing the same way. So they did a good job of making music for all to get some enjoyment out of.  You should expect no less from this band. Buy this album and play it strait threw.  To truly enjoy music one must have respect for all other forms of music.
B00008K78M|5.0|I have seen many live performances and i have been disapointed most of the time.  But with this being one of my favorate artist, I had to check it out.  It is great, and it has all the songs i wanted to hear.  I even liked the duet, and i was impressed with his singing too.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Very colourful and very well presented material. Story gives one person's interpretation of what life after death  may look like. Death by choice or death by chance. The cinematography was just outstanding, colour everywhere and never a dull moment. A real tear jerker.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Contrary to practically everyone elses review, i find Daron's increased voicetime on this album refreshing.  Dont get me wrong, Serj's voice is pivotal to the success of this band, but on amazing songs like sad statue and question, the booming screams of Serj just would not have fit.  A little relaxation from the screaming is welcome.  Also, dont you think that someone(Daron) who wrote half the lyrics, MOST of the instrumentals, and played guitar, bass, and drums in the studio deserves to sing less than half of the words on the album.  This album would have been mediocre at best if Serj did all the singing. The division of the two voices was crucial to this record.
B00005JODA|3.0|The Constant Gardener is a beautiful movie.  The scenery of Africa and parts of Europe are quite captivating.  Ralph Fiennes superbly portrays a diplomat official, Justin Quayle, who wants to find out why his wife (Rachel Weisz) has been raped and murdered.  Was this vile act committed by mere thugs, or is there something more sinister going on?  Tessa, after all, was investigating suspicious tests of AIDS patients who are also threaten with TB.  Are the multinational drug companies behaving in an altruistic manner, or are they diabolically experimenting on helpless indigenous Africans?  Furthermore,  what is the role being played by certain people within the British diplomatic corp?  Sandy (Danny Huston) is Justin's partner and supposed friend.  Is he actually trustworthy?  Justin is a quiet and retiring man who prefers staying in the background.  Will he find the fortitude to relentlessly search for the truth?  There are no weak acting performances in this film.  Director Fernando Meirelles, however, fails miserably in presenting a story that might be able to hold the interest of the general public.  This movie eventually became so boring that I could barely wait for it to end.<br /><br />Am I presenting a biased opinion?  Can I even be remotely fair considering that I  strongly believe only free market economic policies can save the desperately poor of the world?  I think I can achieve this goal, but perhaps others will disagree.  Allow me to be blunt: The Constant Gardener is not even slightly subtle with its anti-capitalist message.  The exact opposite is the unfortunate reality.  I felt like Meirelles employed a sledge hammer approach to convince the audience that the major corporations will stop at nothing, including torture and murder, to increase their profits.  Such heavy handed propagandizing is never appropriate.  One can indeed lay it on too thickly.  A lighter touch is required.  Who will enjoy The Constant Gardener?  Are you someone who like the offerings of Michael Moore and Oliver Stone?  If so, this might be right up your alley.  But if you are anyone else---this film will put you to sleep.  Instead, I strongly recommend The Great Raid starring Ralph Fiennes' brother, Joseph.f Michael Moore and Oliver Stone?  If so, this might be right up your alley.  But if you are anyone else---this film will put you to sleep.  Instead, I strongly recommend The Great Raid starring Ralph Fiennes' brother, Joseph.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This movie is original, entertaining, funny, well directed and acted. The action sequences are excellent,  the comedy is sly and witty, the characters are memorable, the story is well crafted, usually movies that don't stay completly true to the original material aren't that good, this movie is the complete opposite. 5 stars, hopefully the sequel won't dissappoint
B00005OCMR|1.0|The only reason I picked up this movie was because \\"Disney\\" was on the box. I'm a big fan of Disney movies and have never seen this movie before today. I buy Disney movies to entertain my kids (5 and 7) and to watch as a family. So from that perspective, it was very boring. We turned it off after 30 minutes. Older kids really interested in computers and their history might be entertained.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Ever felt suicidal? Sure you have! Well if you're looking for a sountrack to that,this is a CLEVER disguise. Damien Rice, is by far one of the most honest, simplistic song writers out there. The mood of the record at first touch is pain, BUT, as you listen, you sort of see the beauty in that pain. Like, when the sun comes out in the middle of a rainstorm. It leaves you somewhat confused with your emotions. The opening track, Delicate starts to float at an unexpected time leaving one breathless. The blowers daughter from Closer, is so vivid you can almost smell the London rain on the sidewalk as Jude Law made his way towards one Natalie Portman. Amie is as delicate as well, Delicate is. You wonder where she is almost! This man obviously loved her. Cheers drips with a sarcism and hurt poured out from a pen to an instrument. All in all, this man is talent. This man is raw but from being sensitive. This man is Damien Rice and he will scrap his own Suicide Note!! <br />
B000056K04|5.0|I've been a DMB fan since Under the Table and Dreaming and I love this album, despite the addition of an electric guitar. Many fans hate this album, but I like how DMB decided to try something different. I liked Everyday, Mother Father, I Did It, When the World Ends, The Space Between, Dreams of Our Fathers, and Angel.
0553382179|5.0|This is the single most influential book I have ever read besides my Bible.  That may be shocking to read, but it is simply true.

If you are TRULY looking for an answer and a way out of your home that seems to be swallowing you alive, this is the book for you.  If you don't know where to start - you don't know how to get past the clutter and get to a presentable home where you don't feel like you're hiding something constantly - then this is written just for you.  If you are tired of being miserable and yelling at your kids because you can't keep the house clean, read this.  If you are ready to change and not look back, JUMP IN!  FlyLady is going to change the way you deal with your home forever and give you so much spare time to enjoy your kids and home and husband that you won't even remember the ineffective ways you used to crisis clean.  Here's the light you were waiting for.  I know firsthand and am so glad I didn't hesitate in buying this book.
B000068FY0|5.0|If you are in your late 30's or 40 something, then you grew up in the 70's, when people actually bought 12' round vinyl discs and played them on a turntable! If, by chance, you were really into high quality audio sound (refered to as an audiophile), then you should be well acquainted with this musical offering.<br /><br />A company known as Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL), out of California, pioneered the \\"Original Master Recording\\" album. Also referred to as a \\"half-speed master\\". This company would seek out and only accept a first generation master tape to re-issue a popular music album. They made the choices based on popularity and sonic quality. The first few offerings were records of recorded \\"nature sounds\\" such as lightening, wind, streams, birds, etc. I think one was called The Power and the Majesty. The very first musical selection (catalog #1-005) was Supertramp's Crime of the Century. That's one of the reason's I bought this album. As a young music buyer of the day (late '78) I had not heard of Supertramp. I did know who Pink Floyd was and of course, the Beatles. I was surprised that Crime of the Century kept showing up in the MFSL offerings along with Dark Side of the Moon, Steely Dan's Aja, Fleetwood Mac I, and The Beatles Abbey Road. MFSL's Original Master Recordings were limited editions of 25,000 pressings.<br /><br />In the early '80's, they began offering Ultra High Quality Records. Limited to only 5,000 pressings. These were the most incredibly high-quality analog phonograph records ever produced by anyone. Heavy, 200 gram records, pressed on virgin vinyl, so clean you could see light through it.<br /><br />Again, Supertramp's Crime of the Century was one of the first five offerings, along with Floyd's Dark Side. I'm talking about a record that cost $50! Only the ultimate in sound quality music was considered for these very special discs. Even a regular Original Master Recording record cost more that a compact disc does now! About $17.<br /><br />All this history lesson in sound recording media, that I have presented here, is simply to justify the fact that Crime of the Century is quite possibly the finest sounding achievment in all of recorded rock music. A \\"masterpiece\\" as another reviewer put it (pety brawl). Asking the question as to why it didn't stand in the same ranks as Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"? Well...it Does! And it always has. MFSL did not release Dark Side (#1-017) until after Crime of the Century. And way before other greats such as Steely Dan's Aja (#1-033) and Neil Diamond's fantastic sounding Hot August Night 'Live' (#2-024).<br /><br />In the mid-80's, when compact discs first began to emerge in audio stores, the musical selections were very limited. Just like so many older people remember the first album or record they bought with their own money, everyone also remembers the first compact disc they purchased. I was working in the electronics section of a retail store and needed a compact disc to demo the new machines that were arriving. I went to a local high-end audio store that had a small bin of these mysterious new things called \\"cd's\\" for short. And what did I find among the half-dozen classical selections, but Supertramp - Crime of the Century (along with Rush's Moving Pictures). Paid my $18 and walked out. That was our only Demo disc for almost a year, and became quite of few people's favorite after hearing the great music that was within that plastic jewel case./> <br />All this history lesson in sound recording media, that I have presented here, is simply to justify the fact that Crime of the Century is quite possibly the finest sounding achievment in all of recorded rock music.

B00003000M|5.0|I love Bob Marley's music. Spiritual, and full of lyrics about the struggle of the common man. I also like this tribute CD comprising mainly hip hop artistes reworking some of his classics and including Marley's original vocals along with theirs. Brought together by Marley's son Stephen Marley, and sure to infuriate purists.<br /><br />A CD with some of my favourites like Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, The Roots and Guru just has to be great. Steve Tyler of Aerosmith also makes an appearance on `Roots Rock Reggae' which along with `Turn your lights down low' with Lauryn Hill sound (to me) like they could have been actually recorded with the great man himself.<br /><br />Most of the songs have been stripped of their original bassline and beats, and replaced with hip hop beats and rhythms, exceptions being `Rastaman Chant' (with Busta Rhymes & Flipmode Squad) and `No more trouble' (with Erykah Badu) which are the closest to the originals.<br /><br />`Jammin'' (with MC Lyte) is more upbeat and still beautiful. This was always one of my favourite Marley songs. `Johnny was' with Guru is simply awesome. Other standouts are `Guiltiness' (with Lost Boyz & Mr Cheeks), `Survival'(Chuck D) and the downtempo brooding `Burnin' and looting' (with The Roots and Black Thought).<br /><br />A great piece of work sure to introduce a new generation and audience to the music of Bob Marley. It's a wonderful tribute (to the open minded), and not meant to take the place of the originals.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old dancing and singing. I also recommend watching the full-length versions of the many clips that will be shown on this disc such as \\"Singing in the Rain\\".
B000089RVX|1.0|Yeah, right now I finshed listening to this and now I need to pu ke so hang in there... <br /> <br /> <br />Ah, feeling much better! <br />First of all thanks for your patience. <br /> <br />Now to the topic <br />This album (sucks) is just another poser rock album exactly like Linkin Park an Limp Bizkit, well almost, just a girl on vocals. Amy Lee is one of the ugliest things i've ever seen. A 90 years old man that sees her would get a heart attack. She tries to sing opera but it sounds terrible, she's no match for Tarja Turunen or Angela Gossow. The instruments suck, you can barely hear the guitars and the keyboards are too often and so upfront. The song 'My Immortal' is boring as hell, when I first heard it I fell asleep. I cant believe it took the top position on one of the radio channels as the best song of 2003.  <br /> <br />If you want a good female-fronted metal band go for Nightwish, The Gathering, Arch Enemy, or even Lacuna Coil for the matter. If you want a good album in general go get Iron Maiden's 'Number of the Beast' or Dream Theater's 'Images & Words'.
B000066NW0|5.0|I had really high expectations of this album and I mean high.<br /><br />Firstly, because I started off buying her second album then moving on to this one. Secondly, because her sophomore is undoubtedly my favourite album of all time.<br /><br />So you would expect this album to make me happy and it did except now I love it. This album really is worth the listen.<br /><br />Even if you are a casual Avril Lavigne fan or even if you love listening to opera. I'm sure you will love this album.<br /><br />I don't really listen to other people's opinions when it comes to buying records beacuse we all have such different tastes yet I think anybody, anywhere should get behind this album.<br /><br />As you move from song to song you get a real gilmpse of how Lavigne grew in her second album, while not as emotional and mature as it's predecessor this album sure makes up or what it lacks in those terms. Now I also bought this album along with Kate Bush's greatest hits collection \\"The Whole Story\\" and I thought I should listen to this one first because Kate is very challenging to listen to because she has such deep and emotional music. I thought this one would lighten me up before I listened to the other one. However as I said earlier about how her sophomore set is more mature and full of emotion, this one for Lavigne's age at the time is unbeliveable. A teenager with real emotion to convey across the general public. Though at times she still stays typically teen.<br /><br />I really recommend this album.<br /><br />Hopefully you will be able to recognise the spirit in which Lavigne sings and how good this album actually is.<br /><br />Don't listen to the con's or detractors. Listen to her music and make your own mind up.
B000063DFQ|5.0|The album got out in 1983. The first with drummer Nicko McBrain. My 2nd favorite maiden album after Powerslave (alongside NOTB), although this comes very close. This is as well the first Maiden album I ever had and by far in my top 10 best albums ever. Also Dave and Adrian (Beside the debut that Adrian wasn't there) never played better before and here they are proving they are real guitarists. And also Nicko did his job well, although he gets better and better in the next albums.     Where Eagles Dare (11/10): A killer opener and my 2nd favorite on the album. It has a great instrumental part and a long killer solo.    Revelations (10/10): It starts as a power ballad and slow but it becomes faster and heavier toward its end. Probably the best lyrics that written by Dickinson.    Flight of Icarus (10/10): A classic. I have doubts if Bruce can still sing it like this.    Die With Your Boots On (7/10): The least complex song on the album. It has one of the best intros to a Maiden song and the verses are great but I hate the background vocals in the chorus.    The Trooper (50/10): Do I need to explain this rating??    Still Life (9/10): It starts with a backround message. People tend to diss this song for some reason. Its chorus is great. However I didn't much like the solo, although its decent.    Quest for Fire (9/10): This one is dissed even more than the previous, it has a great intro, the lyrics are kinda stupid, but it could get worse.     Sun and Steel (8/10): Nice song. I don't have much to say about it.    To Tame a Land (10/10): A great 7 mins epic. It has cool riffs and basslines.    I don't care if people say this album is filler because of some songs. I think that the last 4 tracks pn the album are 4 of the most underrated Maiden songs. I hear people say it's the weakest Maiden work in the 80's. If you ask me it's ridiculous to say something like ths (how can anyone say it's worse than Somewhere in Time? Man, I have no idea). Anyway pick this up, you won't be dissapointed.    UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I love this CD!  I have listened to it several times and never get tired of it.  The voices are clean, clear and lovely.  The music is inspiring and so, so lovely!
B000002GJH|5.0|I'm 34 years old, and I'm a huge music fan of 80's metal/90's grunge.  I'm very serious when I say that in my 300 CD collection, this album ranks #1 in terms of start to finish tracks.  Unfortunately, it obviously was spawned from a horrific tragedy(Andy Woods' death).  So many of the songs are lyrically inferior to so many other albums.  If ever you are down, just pop this in and it just talks to you.  Chris Cornell should be commended on this masterpiece with his vocals.  He gives you a massage.
B00005JN5X|1.0|The Brothers Grimm (* 1/2) comes off as a what the hell was that boo disappointment movie Directed by Terry Gilliam, who I like, but this really is a far cry from his other movies like Twelve Monkeys and The Fisher King. Will Grimm, played by Matt Damon, the good Ben Affleck (upcoming Scorsese movie The Departed, Dogma) who loses the accent along the way somewhere in the film and his jittery brother Jake Grimm, played by Heath Ledger (Lords Of Dogtown, 10 Things I Hate About You), are two brothers who make up stories, well Jake does the work and Will plays along with it. In the beginning the brothers vanquish a witch from a town, which is a fake, they made it up. Then comes the real deal where they go to a village where 11 girls have gone missing...two including one dressed up like Little Red Riding Hood and the other named Greta (Gretel). The Grimm brothers set out, with a huntress, played by Lena Headey (The Cave, Gossip). Her father vanished a long time ago and it was so obvious that the wolf in the woods was her father..duh. She tells them about this witch, this witch who was in a high tower and over the years she withered and died. The Grimm Brothers then set out and find that the forest is alive and maybe it's not in their imagination. Then, they find out that the witch is still in the high tower and see needs 12 girls for their youth. Funniest part in the entire movie was when actor Peter Stormare (Constantine, The Big Lebowski) kicks a kitty cat into a spinning whirly device. The rest is a big mixed bundle of disappointment...granted, there are some clever ideas in there but it just didnt cut it for me. Also starring Monica Bellucci (The Matrix Revolutions, Brotherhood Of The Wolf) and Jonathan Pryce (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Ronin). What the hell was with the muddy ginger bread cookie man? Did we need that Terry Gilliam? No...what about the horse swallowing the girl? No, No. Ledger and Damon do what they must in this very off movie. When I saw the shiny gold ring in the movie I was remembering back to Lord Of The Rings and I was expecting Viggo Mortensen or Orlando Bloom to pop out and shove the Brothers aside and show them how it's done. Peter Stormare's French man is annoying as hell
B0000214F0|3.0|I've been wondering what the hype is with this movie for about 2 years now.  Out of curiousity, I finally bought it.  Here's what I think: If you're looking for a porn movie, this has some porn, but I'd look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a historical movie, this is a historical film, but I'd look elsewhere.  This movie is easily out-classed by historical films like \\"cleopatra\\", \\"quo vadis\\", \\"ben hur\\", \\"spartacus\\", etc....  If you're looking for a porn movie with a \\"story\\", well, this can pass.  With regards to the movie, frankly I thought Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) was the more insane emperor than Caligula.  Anyway, for $22, the only thing I really got out of this movie, is finally, I don't have to wonder what the hype is all about.  Peace of mind.  So my advise:  If you're curious and don't mind parting with $22, buy it.  However, if you want a real keeper, a good-value-for-money dvd for $22, a collectible dvd, a good title to watch over-and-over again, and $22 is the last money you have to spend on a dvd for this month, then go look elsewhere.
0671799320|4.0|With growing urbanization and rapid population growth, there was growing understanding that the existing sources of energy were rapidly being depleted.  It became obvious to the brightest and most adventurous that whoever found a new energy source would be incredibly wealthy.  Of course, I am talking about the 1850's and the energy source was whale oil.   <br />Thus began the modern age's love affair with petroleum.  The Prize is the best (and as far as this reviewer knows the only) one volume history of the oil industry.  As the author mentioned on CSPAN, he tried to write a history of oil and ended up writing a history of the 20th Century. <br />As mentioned in the reviews and on the cover, this book has been developed into a major PBS documentary.  Additionally, the History channel has done a special based on the book that is quite good.  Moreover, one can see the author providing expert opinion on MSNBC where he is a paid oil consultant.  Despite these other information sources that are available, none of these compare with the level of knowledge in this book. <br />Ever wonder what happened to Standard Oil?  The story is in this book. <br />Ever wonder why we just can not build more refineries in the  <br />U S to fix the refinery short-fall?  That answer is in this book. <br />Ever wonder why the Germans could make synthetic fuel for the last two and half years of WWII and why we still do not do that now?  The answer is in this book. <br />The author's insights and opinions are quite good and as relevant to events today as there were when the book was first published in 1990.  However, he is on shaky ground when he tries to apply his knowledge of the oil industry to warfare.  His analysis on WWI is uniquely insightful, but he only repeats the standard (and accepted) dogma on the Japanese in World War II.  However, when he discusses the land war in Europe in WWII, he is completely in the land of conjecture that more fuel would have ended the war more quickly.It is just as possible that more fuel would have simply allowed Patton to lead his forces off into a trap.   <br />Despite that one shortfall, this is one of those books that every American citizen should read to understand the current world around them.  I can not imagine anyone making intelligent voting decisions or participating in the development of public policy without the firm grounding provided by The Prize.
B000002B7S|4.0|It feels a bit weird reviewing Ozzy's 1983 album \\"Bark At The Moon\\" in light of the \\"remastered\\" version that came out on CD in 2002.  According to certain fans, the 2002 version of \\"Bark...\\" is a travesty due to drastic remixing and/ or re-recording of parts, or whatever.  \\"Bark...\\" had already come out on CD in 1995, not just with a bonus track, but also with what was claimed to be a 22-bit digital remaster, so it's quite sad to think this very well done reissue was pulled out of print in favor of a tainted version of the album.  Ideally, I'd be able to post separate reviews for each of these two versions of \\"Bark At The Moon\\", but unfortunately, here at Amazon, the reviews for both versions are all lumped together instead of separated on their respective pages like they should be. <br /> <br />That said, my rating applies to the 1995 remastered CD.  Making no reference to the 2002 version, \\"Bark At The Moon\\" is a real good hard rocking album.  The late Randy Rhoads was replaced by Jake E. Lee, and in all fairness, Lee was a hell of a guitarist in his own right--okay, maybe the guy does get a little carried away with the whammy bar at times, but it's a very minor quibble.  You've also got to figure that Lee was heavily involved in the songwriting, despite not being credited, and Bob Daisley was probably chipping in as well, although perhaps to a lesser extent.  It's extremely surprising, as well as suspicious, that Ozzy receives the sole writing credit for all the songs on the album.   <br /> <br />In any case, Ozzy's in excellent vocal form here, not counting \\"So Tired\\".  Ozzy really has a great voice for this kind of stuff, and he's well captured in the mix--not too far out front, but not overly buried either. <br /> <br />The hook-heavy title track, with its rapid-fire riffing, gets the album off to a great, exciting start, with that 3 note snippet of the vocal melody recalling \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\".  \\"Now You See It (Now You Don't)\\" is a superbly crafted mid-tempo tune packed with great riffs and vocal hooks.  \\"Centre Of Eternity\\" has a 1+ minute long church-y intro before finally kicking into a thrilling fast-paced rocker with an edgy main riff and excellent guitar fills/ soloing.  The main album portion ends with the nicely moody \\"Waiting For Darkness\\". <br /> <br />A couple tunes find Ozzy 'fighting back' against his detractors.  \\"Rock 'N' Roll Rebel\\" is a pretty lame lyrically, but it's really catchy and energetic.  The keyboard-based power ballad \\"You're No Different\\" is arrestingly creepy and engagingly melodic--it really gets under your skin. <br /> <br />There are some cheesy keyboards that crop up here and there, especially on the somewhat corny \\"Slow Down\\"--it's not a bad tune, but it is a rather uncomfortable mix of hard rock and synth-pop.   <br /> <br />The one genuinely lousy track is the incredibly sappy, painfully forced orchestrated ballad \\"So Tired\\"--it sticks out like a total sore thumb on here.  Give me a break, who in the right mind is going to find this kind of ill-conceived wannabe schlock convincing? <br /> <br />The bonus track is interesting though.  \\"Spiders In The Night\\" actually incorporates some swing-jazz flavoring, and it works quite well, making for an intriguing departure. <br /> <br />Overall, a really good album, and although the remastered CD version from 1995 is out of print, at the moment it seems to be pretty easy to get a used copy of it at a very reasonable price, so keep your eyes peeled for it if you don't already have it. <br /> <br />
B000001FS3|5.0|Simply put, if religion and art could be transcribed into music, this is what it would sound like. It's been what...like over 15 years since this albums release and it still sounds timeless and better than most anything out there in popular music. The writing is top notch, songs just sound so well done. Why some reviewers gave this a one star rating, I'll never know. Forget that, Joshua Tree is the real stuff dude. Best song on the album, \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\". That song gives me the chills.
B000002JNN|5.0|I've found this album getting some really mixed reviews, which is quite mind-blowing. Unless you're a total Bon Scott worshipper who refuses to give Brian Johnson his due, which of course is a big mistake, no hard rock lover should be without this album.    Originally released in September of 1990, \\"The Razors Edge\\" smokes and kicks major ass all over the place--you've got to take your hat off to the late Bruce Fairbairn for his production on this one.     Much has been made that Brian Johnson's voice sounds totally shot on here.  Admittedly, by this time, he no longer had the kind of gloriously piercing edge that you can hear in full force on 1981's \\"For Those About To Rock...\\" and 1983's \\"Flick of the Switch\\".  On the other hand, he's still singing his balls off on here in his usual high-pitched register, and he adds greatly to the album's excitement level.  There's a certain on-the-edge intensity to his vocals here that really gets under your skin.    The big hit \\"Thunderstruck\\", with its classic single-string lead guitar line from Angus Young, gets the album off to a great anthemic start. \\"Fire Your Guns\\" is one of those thrilling fast-paced AC/DC gems that really gets the blood flowing. \\"Money Talks\\" has something of a barroom rock quality, but don't worry, it's hardly Hootie & the Blowfish, and it's got an incredibly catchy chorus. The arrestingly menacing title track is chillingly powerful. For proof positive that Angus and Malcolm Young are kings of hard rock riffery, you needn't look any further than the stomping \\"Got You By The Balls\\"--the main riff is uncanny: deceptively simple and absolutely bone-crunching. The album closes in intensely menacing fashion with the ingeniously crafted stomper \\"If You Dare\\". There's a load more excitement to be found as well with the driving \\"Rock Your Heart Out\\"; the chugging \\"Shot Of Love\\"; and a pair of good-timey party rockers: \\"Are You Ready\\" and \\"Let's Make It\\". Showing what a roll the boys are on, even the tracks that seem filler-ish work--the 'sleigh bells'-fortified \\"Mistress For Christmas\\" is amusingly dumb and irresistibly fun; and \\"Goodbye And Good Riddance To Bad Luck\\", with its utterly tossed off main riff, is also solidly amusing and enjoyable.    Metaphorically speaking, the boys are simply on fire here, and the album is thoroughly a blast. If you're looking to, ahem, \\"Rock Your Heart Out\\", you can't go wrong with this essential hard rock masterpiece.
0792164903|5.0|As far as adaptations of old American novels go, Tim Burton's visually rich, tightly composed, resplendent version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' ranks in the top echelon.  The script for the screen is the work of Kevin Yagher  and Andrew Kevin Walker and while it takes some liberties from Irving's story, the resulting dialogue and action pacing are so wholly in keeping with Burton's vision that it feels like an original story.<br /><br />Much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs (with art direction by Ken Court, John Dexter, and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young) and  Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes.  It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film, but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie.<br /><br />As far as acting, Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness.  He is ably supported by Christina Ricci (in one of her finest moments), and a troupe of brilliant actors that includes Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid.  They appear as though they are daguerreotypes, so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel.  The musical score by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are synchronous with Tim Burton's brilliant direction. This is a treasure of a film.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, September 05

B00005JN5X|4.0|Fairy tales never were. Oh, there was some prettying up in the 19th century and after, to stop the adults from having nightmares, then to keep the kids happy. But the original stories came from small, scared people in a big, scary world that they couldn't control or understand.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam has brought back all that. That thing you almost see moving in the dark corner - it's there. That strange person who seems to know things others don't - she does. That feeling that something is going to get you - it's true.<br /><br />The Brothers start out as carefree con-men, working their petty scams across the countryside. They preyed on the superstitious fears of the peasantry and the simple people of the villages. It turned out, though, that some of those old stories were real. Gilliam brings them to life with a deliciously eerie edge. Being Gilliam, you can count on a few (or more than a few) bubbly giggles mixed in, or the dark mood would simple congeal around you.<br /><br />It's good. I won't spoil the story for you, but it's good. There are some nice effects, but maybe not as many as you'd think. And don't worry about how that mirror got un-cracked after the first hit. It's just good. And scary.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B000063DHL|4.0|It's hard to believe that for a few years, there were many people who thought that Maiden had sold out and would never release another good album again, but today pretty much everyone agrees that this is as much of a classic as some of their earlier stuff. The use of synthesizers broadens the bands sound, but they are not overused. \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" is probably my favorite Maiden song of all time along with my favorite Maiden guitar soloing of all time. \\"Wasted Years,\\" \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" are essential Maiden as well as great live songs. \\"Alexander the Great\\" is an 8 minute history lesson, but is actually one of Maiden's better 80's epics, with a great instrumental section in the middle. The enhanced edition includes lyrics, videos for \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and \\"Wasted Years\\" and phtots of the band on tour. Anyone looking into getting into Iron Maiden is encouraged not to pass this up.

B0000028P8|5.0|Well, maybe not lo-fi, but this is definitely stripped down to the most basic sound that we have heard Ms. Carey in her career. Not that we can blame her, though; a singer/songwriter she may be, penning all her original tunes, but she is definitely more obvious a pop chanteuse with a sprawling vocal range that has always benefited from the well-produced, glossy sheen of her albums.<br /><br />However, due to the fact that her vocals are just as strong in this live setting and that the arrangments are bare bones, save for the soulful backup singers (who only make her sound better), and allow her all the proper space to be at the forefront, \\"Unplugged\\" serves as a fine document of Carey's raw talent. Many uneducated individuals who still dismiss her as all style and no substance still clearly need to give this disc a listen.<br /><br />She first kicks off with the title track from her then most recent release, 1991's \\"Emotions,\\" which is very similar in arrangement to the C&C Club Mix edit, known better as the \\"Special Motion Edit\\" of the song that appears as the final track on the impressive \\"Make It Happen\\" CD Remix Maxi Single. She then charges into \\"If It's Over,\\" also from \\"Emotions\\" which is extremely more impressive live. Her vocals are far more impassioned; and the live setting allows the song a lot more room to breathe.<br /><br />\\"Someday\\" comes next, which takes itself a lot less seriously than the #1 hit studio version from her eponymous 1990 debut LP. Still, Carey sounds wonderful, and the backup singers only add to this festive mix. Then comes her first single, \\"Vision of Love,\\" which Carey humorously introduces as \\"my first single...ever\\" and laughs. She blows the song away, and establishes the first recorded time of dragging out the final notes of her career-making song, which she now infamously does every time she sings it.<br /><br />The semi-autobiographical \\"Make It Happen\\" is swashbuckling fun and Carey sings with the kind of passion indicative of a true sense of coming full circle. This version also outshines the impressive but overproduced LP version very easily.<br /><br />Then comes \\"I'll Be There\\" featuring her long-time friend and musical confidant Trey Lorenz. Soon to be one of the biggest hits of her career, when it was casually launched to radio around the time \\"Unplugged\\" aired, it originally was not at all intended to become a single. Not only did it soon become necessary to release the track as an official single, which would go on to hit #1 easily, but the success of the track is the only reason that cleared the way for the special to get pressed on CD. You can thank Carey and Lorenz for their spine-tinglingly spectacular performance of the song, which will surely still be heard on radio for generations to come.<br /><br />The disc closes with \\"Can't Let Go,\\" which is presented by Carey as an encore she was completely unsure of as to whether it would be performed or not. An understated, low-key reading of the 1991 #2 hit, the performance is not quite on par with the extremely high standard set by the rest of the disc, but is nevertheless a fine closing number to the performance, which is still unfortunately only available on VHS, not DVD. Hopefully the only increasing success of her latest album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" will clear the way for all of Carey's old home videos to be re-released on DVD. *<br /><br />All in all, \\"Unplugged\\" is a novelty item in Carey's catalogue that is truly remarkable. It completely and utterly justifies why she shot to such an incredible height of fame at so young an age in her still only-budding career. Nothing but sheer, pure talent is showcased, while the release also reminds the listener, all these years later, just how far Carey has come in revitalizing her music in the time since then. Indeed, this is what she evolved from, and what an interesting story it is that began.<br /><br />* This has occurred in the intervening years since this review was first written.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|I'll be as brief as possible, as words do not do service to the creative talent of this group.  This is dense, rich and beautiful music, and to be honest really requires several listenings to begin to appreciate.  There is however great beauty and enjoyment to be gleaned from even a casual listening of this project. Metheny and Mays stand without equal in modern Jazz music, not only because of their writing and playing skils but because of the musical communication that exists between two people that have spent this much time performing together.  <br />    As a producer/performer myself, I can only say that the amount of creative time and energy spent on this project would be almost unimaginable, but for the talent, and dedication to art that this group consistently exhibits. As is the case with the best Metheny efforts (such as my favorite album of all time \\"Still Life Talking\\") this is an album that should not be missed.
B000002LFU|4.0|REM played their first concert in Athens, Georgia in April 1980. Their line-up consisted of two Californians (guitarist Peter Buck and basist Mike Mills), a Minnesota native (drummer Bill Berry) and a single Georgian (singer Mike Mills) who had met at the University of Georgia. In the finest traditions of rock 'n' roll, all four dropped out and have since been labelled in some equarters the Godfathers of US 'alt-rock'.     Released in 1988, \\"Green\\" was the band's sixth full-length album, but their first to be released on a major label. Although they continued to work with Scott Litt, who had produced their previous album \\"Document\\", the two albums sound quite different to my ears. \\"Turn You Inside Out\\" is probably the one song on \\"Green\\" that wouldn't have sounded out of place on \\"Document\\" . It's also one of the better songs on this album - though, in contrast to the album's other highlighs, it's totally plugged in and features a guitar riff that grinds in a good way. \\"You Are The Everything\\" and \\"Hairshirt\\" are the two other tracks that stand out for me - gentle acoustic numbers that feature Peter Buck on mandolin rather than electric guitar. \\"World Leader Pretend\\" is another excellent track - a touch less acoustic, though it manages to keep an introspective feel while Bucky Baxter's pedal steel guitar adds a slight country feel to it. The band also saw some chart success wih singles lifted from this album - \\"Stand\\" reached the US Top Ten in early 1989 (it also features Peter Buck's first solo with a newly acquired wah-wah pedal), while \\"Orange Crush\\" made the UK's Top Thirty later that same year. However, I don't really think the years have been kind to either song - while I liked them both well enough at the time, I'd now consider them easily the weakest tracks on the album.    Overall, \\"Green\\" is a decent album. It some great tracks and is well worth four stars - but, on the whole, REM have done better.
B00005JODA|5.0|Justin Quayle, middle-level English bureaucrat (Ralph Fiennes, the perfect Le Carre' protagonist, circa 2005) is palpably appreciative when Tessa (Rachel Weisz, radiant, earth-motherly) deems to, really anoints him with, at the beginning of Fernando Meirelles' \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" a hot session in bed.  In fact, Quayle goes so far as to thank Tessa; which says more about Quayle's commitment to his Freesias, his backyard garden and his avoidance of really living than it does about Tessa's prowess in bed.<br />But that being said, the friction between the stiff-upper lip Quayle and the free-thinking, socially liberal and aware Tessa forms the backbone of Meirelles and Le Carre's outstanding film. Feinnes and Weisz's vibrant and provocative performances give this film a moral and intellectual as well as a human-level sensual and sexual center that binds the worlds of international diplomacy and social consciousness in a way that makes this film not only chock full of real-life ambiguity but also current and thought-provoking as well.<br />But then Justin is transferred to Africa and Tessa pleads with him to take her. And it is at this point that the movie changes tone from one of romance, lust and personal fulfillment to one of subterfuge on several levels: personal, governmental and that involving major drug companies using the medicine starved Africans as guinea pigs for their experimental drugs: many times to disastrous results.<br />Director Fernando Meirelles deserves a place in the pantheon of directors based solely on his revolutionary and disturbing \\"City of God\\" and here he boldly paints his canvas in broad strokes of saturated, gorgeous Technicolor for the scenes in Africa and solemn, dreary gray for the scenes in England and Europe: a little obvious maybe but effective nonetheless. Meirelles also becomes a little preachy towards the end of the film that I could have done without though I know that most people know nothing of what goes on generally in Africa and specifically in regards to the synergies between the African nations and the major drug companies.<br />Fernando Meirelles' \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a terrific movie: breathtaking to look at, superbly acted by all but specifically by Feinnes, Weisz, Danny Huston and Bill Nighy. But it is not an easy movie to love for it wears its heart on its sleeve, at times pleading to us for understanding and compassion and Meirelles sometimes forgets that the best films show us...they do not tell us. Besides all this, there is undeniable power in the images presented and a formidable intellect to back them up and so we give in to it...allowing the exotic and rare perfume of Meirelles film to take us to a place we've never been before.cifically in regards to the synergies between the African nations and the major drug companies.

B00005QW5X|5.0|Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a different type of musical.  While it includes all the elements of a musical (music, song, dance), it tells a story of a person's life.  Most musicals have a point that they try to make, be it social or environmental.  This is simply to tell the story of a person's life.  The music is phenomonal and the acting amazing.  You really feel as if this could be happening.  There is no lights, no camera, it feels so real, Hedwig could be your next door neighbor.  You could be in a diner eating and have this person show up.  It is a moving story of one person's journey through life.  A 5 Star Movie!!
B000059TCE|5.0|All i can say is this is a great movie(s). My kids love it. We also have 3 copies! If you dont have it you should get it <br />
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have to tell you, I somewhat enjoy most of Beck's music.  There are parts of Odelay I enjoyed.  I really enjoy most of his Mutations disc.  I thought that Mutations would be as soft and acoustic as this man could get, but man was I wrong.  Word has it that our good friend Beck broke up with his long time girlfriend, and his ensuing depression brought us the album Sea Change... well, thank goodness he broke up with that girlfriend, because this is a truly magnificent album he has managed to produce.  Although most songs do have a very depressing and melancholy feel to them, you can quite easily get through this entire disc, and not find yourself wanting to jump off a bridge.  These are all very solid, and heartfelt tunes.  Best of all, without him rapping and trying to be funky fresh, we get to hear that this man truly has a very wonderful voice.  I think we all knew that Beck was a gifted man, and a masterful songwriter, but this album only solidifies has greatness.. it is rare that I'll listen to his other music (sometimes Guero will get put in my cd player for fun) but Sea Change is in my regular rotation of cd's.  This is well deserving of all the accolades it has received.  It's haunting, powerful, touching, and sincere.
140003180X|3.0|Isn't it amazing how all mysteries are so easily solved when Mma Ramotswe is on the case? all she needs is just to talk with the right people and then it seems all answers just manage to fall in her lap. I guess somewhere along the first three books of this series I understood that there is no need to be frustrated with the very unserious way the author deals with Mma Ramotswe detection work. This is not a book about crime, but about Africa and the ways of its people. It seems Alexander McCall Smith has a very clear agenda which is to hail old Africa and the old Botswana ways, a message he delivers across all books of this series.<br /><br />Another issue that bothers me is the fact that there is no differentiation between the characters way of speech. Mma Ramotswe very unique talk is repeated by all other characters.  What I mean is that unless this is some kind of a special African way of speech (which might be the case and I am just too ignorant to know) then all the characters seem to speak in the same way. All talk in the very short sentenced, one thought at a time speech. A good example would be the following: \\" That is very sad\\", said Mma Ramotswe. \\"But the late dog would not have suffered. At least there is that\\". Or Mma Makustsi writing a letter in the same style: \\"This is a very moving essay, which is well typed. You should tell this lady, though, or she might never know. You should ask her to go with you after the class. That is what you should do\\".<br /><br />And yet, after all my criticism is said and done, I do find myself returning to this series and buying the next book in line. There is still a charm to the traditionally built Mma Ramotswe and all her surrounding characters which we grow to be fond of. My favorite is Mma Matuski, but that's my own problem.
B00000269G|5.0|This is one of the albums my Papa played for me right after he said those 5 words that forever changed my life:\\"Boy, now this is Jazz!\\" God bless this wonderful artist who grunted and moaned his way into all of our hearts for over 50 years and wrote what's probably the most performed tune in Jazz history \\"Misty\\".

B0000B1OFL|5.0|F. Gary Gray did a great job with this flic. Tight action, good plot, furious action.... Not much more to add. The characters were very well cast. I particularly liked the part play by Mos Def.

0783240287|5.0|I cant get my kids off this musical.  We dont watch much TV, and its the ONLY thing they want to watch.  Its also the only thing they want to listen to in the car or really any other time.  Although the play is better in person (as one would expect) I think this is extremely well done and Donny Osmand is actually really good.  Great music and dancing and costumes.
0316172324|2.0|The author is smart enough to pen down ( and cash in ) what we already know...to trust our instincts. The first and the second last chapters are definitely an interesting read. In between these two chapters all he does is to narrate examples of supposedly( i havent heard of any of these people) famous people on how they trusted their  2-second snap decisions / judgements. The author has made very little attempt to give any sort of insight on how our instincts really  work. I must agree with one reader that its like going through psychology 101. The only part I truly enjoyed reading was the piece of information on autism. <br /> <br />All said , I must admit the author did a good job in collecting data and he sure knows how to write. I have no doubt we will see more of his books in future .......lets just hope he writes something better. <br /> <br />Buy this book when the price drops to 5 bucks.
8467202203|5.0|Definitely a big change in topic for Mrs. Allende, but delightlful as usual.  In spite of being fiction, still raises very real issues about the Earth where we live, relationships, and self-discovery.  Wonderful!
1593072937|5.0|This book was used nearly word for word and frame for frame to produce the Sin City movie. With that said I still find it a terrific read. The writing is incredible. Frank Miller's use of narration is succinct in delivering a complete story from start to finish.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I guess I should start off by saying a big thank you to Mr. Buble for singing songs I needed to hear. With all the tragedy our country is facing at the moment to play this cd and be taken far away is what I needed and what I yearned for. Beauty, kindness, happiness, compassion, love - those words all come to mind when I think of what this compact disc speaks of. When I turn off CNN or the local news here in Kansas that seem only to be filled with sad stories I turn on my cd player and get the lift I need to face another day. <br />Music does move one's soul and lift one's spirit and this cd needs to be heard by the world at a time like this. It has given me pause to be thankful for what I have and to pray for so many others that face challenges unheard of in our time right here in our fine country. If the song Home doesn't touch all our collective souls now, nothing will...........
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|SOAD return with the same \\"metal with an offbeat twist\\" sound you expect. The biggest difference is that Darren, the guitarist had taken a much more prominent role in singing and lyrics on this album.  Serj is an awesome, original singer in his own right, but this evolves the band into a newer realm - something that most bands can't pull off, but is necessary to survive more than a few albums.  I have all the SOAD albums and have been listening to them since before their first radio single.  The only problem is that a few songs are so repetetive you are glad they're only a couple minutes long.  The interludes and instramentals in most songs are great, and the switch between political statements and songs about loving your \\"****\\" are a crazy, entertaining combo. However, I'd like to see less repetition that reminds me of bad rap sometimes.  Overall, SOAD rules!!!
0385334206|4.0|My favorite part about this book are the drawing by Vonnegut that you find through out the book.  \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is classic Vonnegut and with the exception of the drawings, is a great lismus test for reads who are curious with whether or not they will like Vonnegut.  However, do NOT watch the movie as it is terrible.  Enjoy the book.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|This was one of the most fake and stupidest movie ever.There's so much stunts in this film thats so fake it's unbelieveable.I like Ice Cube , he plays a good bad#ss and this role was for him but the stunts he had to perform are overated.This movie really stands for Hollywood.Not worth buying or renting.I ended up shutting it off about 35 minutes in.It's too bad that Willem Dafoe had to be in this movie.Ice Cube needs to stick to his Cube Vision flicks.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This movie is strange and hard to follow.  The only thing I know for sure about it is that Naomi Watts gets topless and makes out with another girl.  Granted it is a David Lynch movie (the guy who brought you Twin Peaks), but everything keeps changing, including the characters, names, and what's going on.  Maybe you will like it, maybe you won't.  I can't really recommend it, but I can't really say don't get it either.
B0009UC7HA|3.0|Sahara was not better than Indiana Jones obviously.To be honest there's actually no comparing the two at all.I understand why people would think the two are alike but they aren't.Sahara offers more gun shootings , killings and car and boat chases.But all that doesn't even matter ,when you have Harrison Ford playing Indiana and George Lucas is the writer.  Sahara was a decent ride ,but people should put there foot in their mouths when they speak of Indiana Jones.  Steve Zaun finally plays a tough guy character.He's a weapons specialist and he adds a hint of comedy.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is the perfect Sci-Fi Action \\"suspension of disbelief\\" movie. I saw it in theaters multiple times when it came out and have watched, rewatched, and rented it on VHS and DVD many more times over the years. Finally, I broke down and bought a used DVD. If you have never seen this one and like Sci-Fi Action/Adventure - go get it, NOW!
B000007T1M|5.0|I just got to say first of all is that System of a Down is one of the best metal/nu-metal out there. This album has everything to it: good riffs, heavy lyrics, and everything else. This album combines everything we know about heavy metal but turns it into something we don't. There are memorable songs on this album which we take for granted like \\"War?\\" \\"Sugar\\" and \\"Spiders.\\" When System of a Down released their mega-hit \\"Toxicity,\\" fans of them were reluctant because their sound had changed from heavy metal to a nu-metal status. Fans didn't take that because they didn't want MTV to change them into something that they were not. But, when they released their new album, Mezmerize, it was again a revolutionary turn for System of a Down. It shot up on the charts and had huge hits as \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" and \\"Question!\\" But, even though this album wasn't as for say successful as the others, it was a well composed album. When you hear the first song \\"Suite-Pee\\" you immediatly get attached to the sound and want to hear the rest of it. \\"Sugar\\" has the funniness to it yet, being very hardcore as well. Here are the track titles:    1. Suite-Pee - 10/10  2. Know - 9/10  3. Sugar - 10/10  4. Suggestions: 8/10  5. Spiders - 9/10  6. Ddevil - 8/10  7. Soil - 8/10  8. War? - 10/10  9. Mind - 7/10  10. Peephole - 9/10  11. CUBErt - 10/10  12. Darts - 9/10  13. P.L.U.C.K. - 10/10    Overall one of the best System of a Down album to date.
B0006284JQ|1.0|No, just no. People call Britney a \\"pop artist\\". This is not pop. This is over-comercialized bubble gum, electronic, computer-stimulated TRASH. You wanna listen to some real pop? Listen to Michelle Branch or Vanessa Carlton.  <br />I admit, these songs are pretty catchy. They make you want to get up and dance. But the lyrics are disguisting and meaningless. Shes singing the word \\"sex\\" over and over again to appear more grown up or sexy or whatever. Well, look how she ended up. Pregnant with twins.  <br />please, don't buy this. Her vocals are flat and boring and the same for each song. Check out Vanessa Carlton or Michelle Branch or Kelly Clarkson if you want pop. Check out Avril Lavigne or Skye Sweetnam if you want rock/soft rock. Anything but this.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggars Banquet was the last entire album recorded with the original Rolling Stones (Brian Jones showed up occasionally on Let It Bleed, but died during the recording). Banquet also marks a beginning: the start of the Stones' 1968-1972 run. Although I consider it the weakest of the \\"big four\\", I still love it.<br /><br />The album opens on an ominous note: Sympathy For the Devil, my all-time Stones favorite. Sympathy is a true classic, and the most lyrically complex tune they ever recorded (My second favorite, You Can't Always Get What You Want, is their most musically complex, but that's a different matter). It portrays humans as the devil, and truly blows me away. No Expectations stands as one of the group's more underrated efforts, as well as one of their more personal. Mick's voice on Dear Doctor is quite annoying, but other than that I like it. Same with Parachute Woman. Jigsaw Puzzle, the album's second best, is the second of three meaningful epics. Street Fighting Men stands as a rightful classic, and tribute to the turmoil going on in England at the time. Naturally, it's pretty chaotic. Prodigal Son is the first old blues tune out of five that the Stones would cover in the next five years. It's okay, but one of the weakest. Stray Cat Blues, another favorite, rocks hard and drips with sleaziness. Then there's the single weak track: Factory Girl. I HATE Factory Girl. Thankfully, things pick up again on Salt of the Earth, an epic featuring Keith Richard's first time as a lead vocalist and a choir backing them up. This is, quite obviously, the predecessor to You Can't Always Get What You Want, with amazing lyrics, the aforementioned choir, and the ending, in which Charlie kicks the whole business into double-time and the choir repeats one phrase. Salt is highly underrated, and that's a shame.<br /><br />If you want the Rolling Stones, do this: Get Hot Rocks/Forty Licks, Banquet, Let It Bleed, Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street, maybe Voodoo Lounge, and hope that Bigger Bang shapes lives up to it's extreme potential. (Rough Justice, Streets of Love and Back of My Hand!), and hope that Bigger Bang shapes lives up to it's extreme potential. (Rough Justice, Streets of Love and Back of My Hand!)
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|Nothing demonstrates the remarkable range of Peter Weir, who made the adventure film \\"Master and Commander,\\" better than the simultaneous DVD release of special editions of \\"Witness,\\" a culture-clash thriller, and \\"The Truman Show,\\" science fiction until reality TV surpassed it. Is there no genre this Australian director has not tried? An anti-war polemic? \\"Gallipoli,\\" with newcomer Mel Gibson. The supernatural? \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock,\\" based on a true incident. Coming of age? \\"The Dead Poet's Society,\\" with comic Robin Williams in his first serious role. You name it, Weir has done it, and done it extremely well.    How fortunate for comic Jim Carrey to have had Weir to tame his rubber-faced antics in his first serious role. The coincidence does not minimize the talent that Carrey exhibits in \\"The Truman Show\\" and the sensitivity with which he exercises it. His lead performance was among the finest in its year not to be nominated for an Academy Award, and seeing it again on DVD only magnifies the slight. Truman lives an ordinary life under extraordinary circumstances: he is the clueless central figure, from birth to the present, in a popular reality TV show in which his home and town are settings and his wife, parents, co-workers and best friend are actors.    Ed Harris is the eerily competent director of the show within this show. His assistant is nicely played by Paul Giamatti, who also was slighted by Oscar for his 2004 lead in \\"Sideways.\\" The details and dynamic of the subterfuge, involving logistics and product placement, and how the show deals with Truman's awakening to the truth, are fascinating. As actors playing his wife and friend, Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich have funny and moving exchanges with Carrey, whose genius is not to be denied. His other forays into film drama have not been as successful as this truly original work. Its gorgeous musical score is by Philip Glass.
B00003CXA2|5.0|\\"Forrest Gump\\" remains one of my all-time favorite movies, and this DVD really delivered. The movie itself has everything: love, drama, comedy, action- and the acting is fantastic. The DVD is great- it has excellent special features that give you information about how they made the movie, including featurettes about some of the cooler effects. Overall, it was definitely worth the price to turn in my old VHS copy for the DVD version.

0316172324|4.0|I like reading Gladwell's material--his articles in the NewYorker are first class--because of his passion for finding the esoteric and distilling it into something that an everyday person can understand. In Blink, Gladwell is nonpareil in amalgamating seemingly unrelated subjects and weaves them into a compelling argument, which goes as follows: our conclusions are often made at a speed faster than the blink of an eye, and we must be aware of this tendency, and check it in situations when it is a disservice. Gladwell, for instance, cautions against this when life or death situations are involved.    The irony is that whereas Blink is about first-conclusion-bias and how it can cause egregious consequences, Gladwell is himself a victim of first conclusion bias, and this has compromised what would have otherwise been a superb book. For instance, we are presented with an unusual study that concerns the heights of the Fortune 500 C.E.O.  According to Gladwell, there is causa justificio to believe that since most C.E.Os are over 6'-tall the Warren Harding error is at play. (Gladwell goes at length to explain what the Warren Harding error is.) I fear that by just looking at patterns and forming conclusions based on those patterns, Gladwell has himself been a victim of \\"thin-slicing.\\"     Nonetheless, the writing style is first rate; William Strunk is smiling in his grave.    Gladwell covers the Amadou Diallo case extensively, but relies almost entirely on the testimony of the officers as his source. I wonder what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have thought about such a methodology.    The helpful anecdotes in the book were the Getty Museum Kouros Scandal, the study on the car dealerships in IL, the Munchen Philharmonic and trombonist saga, the story on Paul Ekman, and the Love-Connector.    If it weren't for Gladwell's propensity to draw conclusions based on apocryphal situations or data, I would have rated it 5 stars. Nonetheless, a fascinating insight into the arcane fieldof cognitive psychology.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|My favorite A song for you, I bought the disc because I listened it, I did not  like the others as much, even when I forced myself to listen them a lot, anyway I agree the disc is great.
B00005JNTX|4.0|First off, the visual imagery in this film is creative, true to the graphic novels, and powerful. Second, they used Mickey Rourke perfectly with the makeup and his build, he was perfect to play the character of Marv. True, the violence in this film is extreme, but that is a major component of what the graphic novel and the storyteller were attempting to convey - and the film stayed true to that. The use of color in some scenes was also visually powerful. I would very much recommend this film for those who are interested in this genre (though I honestly wouldn't know how to classify this one, other than action-drama). For fans of Jessica Alba, well, you won't be disappointed, either...<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...
B000002UUH|4.0|I believe if John Lennon was alive today, he would still be writing songs about peace and hope. There are lots of those on this album. The material is superb but the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired as it almost changes from track to track. The album 'Imagine' has been remastered so it's surprising that this one has not.  In spite of that, there's 71 and a half minutes of really good music.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Constantine, the latest in a long line of films adapted from the comic book/graphic novel lines, is also one of the best.  True, the story as it was orignally written deserves most of the credit.  But, the acting in this film (even the much lamented Keanu Reeves) is believable and suited well for this movie.  I do wish there had been more types of demons enountered (along with the various ways to vanquish them - similar to the opening scene), but one must review what is on the screen, not what isn't.  Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this one - nothing was overdone (which is easy to do in this type of genre) - even the appearances of Gabriel, Balthazar, and Lucifer are convincingly presented, without being campy or cliched.  I ended up buying this one to watch again... definately recommended.<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...

B00000294R|5.0|The first thing I have to say regards not this album but people who speak out AGAINST violence in hip hop when they should instead try to understand WHY it exists in the first place. Well, Big L provides the answer in this Album. I am from New York, and I live near Harlem, and I know OF what goes on there or what had been occurring during L's lifetime, but I cannot offer any substantive message explaining violence and loss, because I have not experienced those things. But violence is real. Death is real, and most real in places like Harlem of the mid-ninties. Big L's sound, expression, lyrics and unflinching confidence in himself and his style underpins this entire album. It is true that the content of his lyrics revolves around only a few central themes (violence, bragging, misogyny, etc), but look deeper into that. Why is he saying those things? Because that is what he knows and that is what he SHOULD be rapping about, and he does it better than anyone. For those not acquainted with Big L, he slaughtered Jay-Z in a battle during the 1990s. Jay-Z lost his flow while L hadn't broken a sweat and was tap dancing on Jay-Z's lamentable attempts to keep pace. Similarly, on this album, Big L accomplishs feats like squeezing 4 syllables into where only two should be, with velvet-smooth flow that is enhanced by this rollercoaster ability that only L perfected. Every track is lyrically excellent. The beats are both euphonic and spare, gritty and feel-good, and never repetitive. Appearances by D.I.T.C. throws even more super sweet-and-smooth content into an already flowing and hard-hitting mix. As if to prove his hardcore worthiness, L was shot and killed in 1999 by cold-hearted bastards retaliating for things his BROTHER had done. Perhaps the first line on the album says it best \\"Hey Jones you betta flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks, L keeps rappers hearts pumpin' like Reeboks\\" do yourself a big favor and make the purchase.
B000268QB2|5.0|Last week I was watching an SNL rerun and dozed off early in the show. I woke up sometime later to hear Keane's performance--and I'm so glad I did. I've been listening to this disc ever since. My favorites, which are showing no signs of wear after a solid week of continual play on my iPod, are \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and \\"Everybody's Changing.\\" <br /> <br />Listening to this music, I feel the same way I do after a trip to the spa: calm, soothed, encouraged, restored, hopeful. *long sigh* <br />
B0007OY33O|5.0|The subtitle is \\"Saving Mariel\\".  But what is to be saved:  her soul, her body, her utility to Taro (the sole male protagonist)?<br /><br />This jiggly comedy goes dark rapidly.  Weapons and emotions are deployed and used, main characters are hurt, and really hard decisions must be made.  The final episode is reasonable, but doesn't completely conclude the story.  I'm hoping for a second series of DVDs!<br /><br />This series has developed some of the most complete and endearing secondary characters in all of harum anime.  They're as well developed as those in Tenchi, Love Hina or Ai Yori Aoshi, in only 3 DVDs.
B0006IIPJ4|3.0|Beyond the obvious homage to the pulp sci-fi of the Fifties Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow offers a fresh spin on the old mad-scientist-takes-over-the-world-scenario. With its 21st Century special effects - used in a sort-of sepia tone throwback to the monster movie two reelers, Sky Captain will dazzle you with some truly nifty visuals. However, what's missing here is character development and a coherent editing of the action sequences. The stars certainly can chew digitized scenery as well as, well... the digitized characters,  but even their make  pretend expertise leaves the viewer incredulous. Miss Paltrow especially, looks rather bored and uninvolved, perhaps too much time in the green screen studio instead discussing character nuances and subtext with her director. Here's a movie that really defines \\"high concept\\" it's too bad that alternate-past conceptualization took precedence over present day story development.
B000003ER4|5.0|The poetry of the libretto, the Italianate vocal writing, the stunning <br />harmonic vocabulary all make for an opera of almost unendurable <br />beauty.  The commedia dell'arte scene in the second act provides <br />the only \\"light\\" touch, and it is also heavily colored in fin-du-siecle tones.  When the music of the first act duet returns to finish the <br />opera, it is enough to wring tears from a stone.  A must have recording, worth serious investigation.  I have the Naxos recording <br />as well:  If budget allows, get them both.
0553212478|5.0|I read this in high school, and I must say that I feel in love with this book... The concept in the whole story line is what I love... And knowing that I wasn't a big fan of reading when I was in high school, this book was truly and exception..
B000002JS6|4.0|When asked to describe this album, the first word that came to mind was fun. This is such a good Album to listen to speeding down a highway or if you're in a good mood and just want to rock out. Even though the guitar riffs are simple they have so much attitude in them that you don't even think about it. Like most, I was skeptical that ACDC would be able to carry on after the death of Bon Scott, but they sure proved critics wrong with this album perhaps being their best in my opinion. The only problem with this album is that it will most likely only appeal to hard rock loving, beer drinking men. Meaning woman most likely won't find anything they like except for the songs \\"Back in Black\\" or \\"Shook Me All Night Long\\" Which they probably wouldn't if they really listened to the lyrics. Few flaws aside, Here is my review.  <br /> <br />Hells Bells- Great way to open this album. This is one of my top 3 favorites on the album and for good reason. This whole song screams Attitude.  <br /> <br />Shoot to Thrill- Good song right here, I thought it should of got more radio play than it did. Not the best song on the album but good enough to listen to 10 times in a row  <br /> <br />What Do You Do For Money Honey- The main guitar riff is a little too simple for me. The chorus makes up for it however. Very catchy and fun to sing. Some woman may find this song offensive so don't listen to it while your girl friend or wife is around.  <br /> <br />Given the Dog a Bone- I know I said your female partner wouldn't like the last track but she really wouldn't like this one. That doesn't make it a bad song however. Even the most respectful guy towards woman wants to get dirty every once in awhile and this song is for the guys who love rough meaningless sex.  <br /> <br />Let Me Put My Love Into You- As close to a ballad as this album gets. Like the last 3 tracks, it involves sex but this one is a milder form of them. This is a song your female partner shouldn't mind. One of the top 5 best songs on his album is this one. Good Melody and rhythm throughout makes it a pretty easy listen.  <br /> <br />Back In Black- This song contains one of the greatest most memorable guitar riff ever created. When I'm driving this song is a foot stomper, car door tapper, and steering wheel puncher all at once, it will really get you that hyped. This song is my personal favorite on the album. Close to perfect harmony and melody. Lyrics fit perfectly with the music. This song would easily make my top 50 favorite songs of all time list if I decided to make one.  <br /> <br />Shook Me All Night Long- Another great song on this epic album. I could listen to this song 1000 times in a row without it getting tired. What a great guitar riff used in the verses. The chorus is very catchy and memorable.\\" Shook me Alllll Niiiiiight Looong!!!\\" Another song that would be on my top 50 songs ever made.  <br /> <br />Have a Drink On Me- Guess what this song is about, go on guess. If you said offering your grand mother a glass of cold lemonade, you are far off my friend. Good song to down a cold beer while your listening to it. Always makes me want to drink when I hear it. As for the song, pretty good compared to the last two tracks.  <br /> <br />Shake a Leg- This is where the album starts to dip in my opinion. It might not even be the song I just get a little bored of these sex songs after awhile.  <br /> <br />Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution- The intro to this song is pretty cool in my opinion, especially the guitar riff. As for the rest of the song, its alright. Just seems mediocre compared to the other 3 epic tracks on this album. That doesn't mean this song is bad however.  <br /> <br />The message of this album is simple, \\"Drink, Party and Screw\\" As fun as this Album is to listen to, a lot of the songs sound the same until you get to the chorus. Also I wouldn't of minded one slow song on this album. All and all this is still a great album to listen to. When it comes to a party hard, drink heavy, screw all night album, this album is without a doubt the best one to get.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005YW4H|4.0|Come Away with Me is a subtle gem.  In a world where everybody feels like they have to toot their own horn, Norah Jones is as refreshing as (insert your own Andy Griffith-Mayberry-ism). The pacing on this album is very...well, let's call it elegant; not too much instrumentation, nobody showing off, everybody making everybody sound great, everybody presenting the songs in their pure beauty. <br />Jones' sound is captivating and unique, an interesting blend of jazz, pop, country, and a dash of the blues.  Her vocal timbre is instantly recongnizable, and she controls the nuances of her voice perfectly.  She doesn't do that annoying-because-everybody-is-doing-it-ad nauseum \\"breaky\\" singing thing like The Cranberries or Alanis Morrisette.  Her style, although compared to some of the great blues singers of the past, like Billie Holliday, is really her own.  In fact, her actual voice is better than Holliday's.  In fairness to Holliday, most of her recordings are from later in life, when her difficult life had added an edge to her once-velvety vocal cords. <br />The Amazon reviewer complains that Jones' compositions don't hold up well to classics included on the album, such as Hank Williams' Cold Cold Heart and The Nearness of You, by Hoagy Carmicheal and Ned Washington.  I'm not sure what he means; Jones writes the stirring Come Away with Me, and co-writes the hit, Don't Know Why, with her guitarist Jesse Harris.  Most of the rest of the album is written by members of the band, and not one of these songs lacks for anything. <br />Jones' piano is very nice and understated, and Harris' acoustic and Telecaster work is stellar, with every fill and solo hitting right on target, and each one different and interesting. <br />I very rarely give a five-star rating (I think they're overused by Amazon's reviewers), but Miss Jones' debut gets a solid 4 1/2.

B00005JMAH|5.0|When I first saw this 3rd installment movie of Harry Potter's (HP) adventure, I was absolutely taken and truly mesmerized by it.  This movie truly reflects the major events in the book (even though I wished that the movie could be a little bit longer).  This 3rd HP movie finally shows a realistic Hogwarts - the aging but still majestic castle, the creepy and dreadful Dementors (sooo scary!!), Hagrid's big hut, the Dark Forest, the Quittich games, etc.  I loved everything about this movie because - to me - it best reflects the growing dark mood written in the book.  This 3rd Harry Potter movie is very much better than the 1st and 2nd movies.
B00009UW0N|5.0|In 1978, John Carpenter took what Alfred Hitchcock created, nearly two decades eariler, and perfected it. The difference between Psycho and Halloween is that Psycho had the feeling of Hollywood and big money production, which takes away from the authenticity of the film. When you watch Psycho, you feel like you are watching a movie, but when you watch Halloween, it has a \\"real\\" feel to it and you feel like you are looking out of your window and watching the events happen.<br /><br />The story is about a group of girls who have to babysit kids on Halloween night. They get drunk and mess around, while they are stalked by a dark figure who lurks in the shadows. Is he a shadow or is he the darkness itself? If you want to personify the evil, you can call him Michael Myers. He murdered his sister when he was six, spent many years in a sanitarium, and one Halloween night, he decides to go trick-or-treating. It is unfortunate for Laurie (and very unfortunate for her friends) that Halloween 1978 is the night he came home. Michael Myers is like a tornado. He is a force of nature that can not and will not be stopped. Stabbings and bullets could not keep him down. He IS the dread that lurks in the shadows...Welcome to John Carpenter's classic...Halloween!! And just remember, we're all entitled to one good scare!<br /><br />From the moody stalking sequences to the murders to Carpenter's score of the film, Halloween is a perfect fright flick. It doesn't display all the gore of other films in the genre, such as Friday the 13th, The Evil Dead, or Day of the Dead, but it has atmosphere, mood, tone, and Hitchcock influenced suspense.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This film has been promoted as a \\"psychological mystery,\\" and on one level it is that.  But it goes much deeper, and reads almost like a Flannery O'Connor story translated to an urban postmodern setting by Rod Serling.  There are also resonances with Dostoevsky: indeed, one of the pivotal character's names is Ivan, and the book the main character, Trevor Reznik, reads in the movie is THE IDIOT.  There are also a lot of incidences of symbolism: light vs darkness, right vs left, etc. and lots of symbolic reversals and inversions.  These all play into the \\"mystery\\" element:  how much of what Reznik experiences is real, and how much is in his head?  And why are these things happening to him in the first place?  All this is resolved in a very satisfying ending, which packs quite an emotional wallop.  In that sense it reminded me a bit of O'Connor's story \\"Parker's Back.\\"  It also bears rewatching, as much of the symbolism is only made clear at the end, and if you watch it again knowing the denouement the symbols, foreshadowing, etc. become much more apparent.  This isn't just another trick film like THE USUAL SUSPECTS (excellent) or IDENTITY (not so excellent). It has a deep moral and philosophical resonance that other films of this type don't have.    Christian Bale (the new \\"Batman\\") is excellent as Reznik; he lost 60-some pounds to play the role and in some scenes he is painful to look at, resembling a death-camp refugee.  The other cast members are good too, especially John Sharian as a creepy co-worker who seems to know more about Reznik than he should, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as a world-weary hooker who gives Reznik some temporary solace.  The direction is reminiscent of Hitchcock, and the score too recalls that of Hitchcock films, being unusually \\"retro\\" (very much in the Bernard Herrmann mode) and not at all industrial or postmodern-sounding like one might expect.    Be warned that the film is a bit of a hard \\"R.\\"  There is some partial nudity, a fair amount ofcoarse language, etc.  But having said that, I can honestly say that I haven't seen a movie in ages (and certainly not a contemporary one) that deals with the same issues that O'Connor and Dosty did, in any kind of adult, satisfying manner.  I'd also advise against reading reviews of the film online: many of those I've read have been \\"spoilers,\\" and most in any case deal only with the surface elements of paranoia and alienation, not with the deeper moral and philosophical issues.  Guilt and grace are here, but not in ways you'll expect.  One of the Desert Fathers said, \\"It is a greater miracle for a man to see himself as he really is than to raise the dead.\\"  Think about this as Reznik searches for the answer to the chief question of the film: \\"Who are you?\\"     P.S.  To the reviewers who keep comparing this movie to FIGHT CLUB: you need to pay more attention. This is NOT a \\"double personality movie,\\" or a one-trick pony like that lamentable film was.  As for reviewer \\"Jimmy\\" who wants the Dostoevsky comparisons to be stopped, and sees nothing redemptive in THE MACHINIST, he definitely needs to read Flannery O'Connor.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|I'm sorry to have to say this, but this sucked.  I love Adam Sandler.  He's great.  Normally.  This wasn't his best work and it's a shame because there was potential to get this made better.  I haven't seen the original, but I believe it was a poor remake.  I loved Courtney Cox.  Burt Reynolds I can't stand.  I loved all the inmates bodies.  But the humour lacked a little and the stupidity was high.  Please do better next time.
B00006JDU9|5.0|A wonderful prequal to the star war trilogy unfortunatly the following chapters are not as good. I recommend highly.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The Shield is an amazing tv drama.  It's raw, compelling, gritty and exciting.  It's a bit heavy going, but I think that's what makes it stand out from all else.  Michael Chiklis is great as Vic Mackey.  He's a good bad cop.  While he's on the wrong side part of the time, you always want to be on his side.  He doesn't take no s*&t.  He is effective in bringing down the bad guys and clever at hiding his trail.  No wonder he's been given the Emmy nod several times. <br /> <br />If you are looking for your average cop drama, this isn't it.  It's above and beyond the rest.  Take a look at it.
B00005B36H|5.0|But I will say it again: Amazing. <br />Obtain this art, for it will better you.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV has proven itself to be one of the greatest albums of all time. \\"Black Dog\\" 's riff is simply magnificent. \\"Rock 'n Roll\\", although more famous for being in an American Cadillac ad campaign, is still a wonderful song. And, of course, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is definitely a Top 3 song of all time (only Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen could really top it). <br />Led Zeppelin is one of the few bands that live up to its name. In fact, the band exceeds its name. Listen to this album, and you will discover that. <br />Robert Plant and Jimmy Page are both brilliant musicians. Robert Plant has a wonderfully unique voice, and Jimmy Page's guitar rivals that of Jimi Hendrix (in my opinion, even beats it). <br />Buy this album. It's money in the bank. You will treasure it once you listen to it. <br />
B00004WC6J|5.0|You either love or hate DS's music; you either get it or you don't.  For those of you that do get it, this is a very good compilation that is very representative of his life's work to date and includes his time at Japan e.g. \\"Ghosts\\" as well as his collaborative work with e.g. Ruichi Sakamoto \\"Bamboo Houses\\".<br /><br />These two tracks also happen to be my favourites but the other tracks are also very good and the track order makes for very smooth listening, so much so that for a newcomer, the album sounds very cohesive and is a good listen.  DS has a very unique style and this is a very good album to get to get to know the man and his music.  Recommended.
B000002J09|3.0|I decided to give this one a listen after finding with the other zep records in the basement. By Zeppelin standards it's not unlike any other of their first albums. Accept it has Stairway to Heaven on it: <br />\\"How Many More Times\\" do we have to hear this song on the radio? The label \\"Best Song Ever\\" is really stretching it. The guitar solo is suposedly so great, but it's barely audible. Oh, and there is a controvercial backwards message on it. I listened to the snippet and it's just rambling and a coincidence. These people are just hearing what they want to hear. <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin is supposedly associated with Satan what with the backwards messages, and the old wisetale of Jimmy Paige making a deal with the devil for sucess in exchange for their souls? No wonder hardcore fands are always saying things like \\"If you don't like Stairway to Heaven, the go to hell.\\" <br /> <br />Black Dog, Rock and Roll, and Going to California are the good songs the rest is fairly overrated, purely because they are Led Zeppelin songs. There are much better albums out there where every song is good, and it changes music. Check out \\"Are you Experienced\\", \\"Tommy\\", \\"Quadrophenia\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", even \\"Led Zeppelin II.\\"  <br /> <br />I was also told there is some supposed connection with this album to \\"The Hobit\\", which is a prequil the \\"Lord of The Rings\\" books. Whatever the similarity is I'm not catching it. <br /> <br />If you were wondering why the instrumentation on the album is so tight, it's because they do about fifty takes per song and overdubs. That's why they're such a disapointment live. They are a kick-ass band though, I can't lie. <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with critsizing something you love. For me: <br />1. The Beatles' early stuff is mostly lame compared to their brilliant later work. <br />2. The Who's early songs are also amatuer. <br />3. I hate the Band of Gypsys album minus \\"Machine Gun\\". <br />4. Pink Floyd's \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is a great big nothing, and their 80's stuff both bite and stink. <br />5. The Rolling Stones have been going at it for too long. <br /> <br />There, I just criticized my five favorite artists and you Led heads or whatever you want too call yourself can too. <br /> <br />If I have to hear \\"Get the Led out\\" one more time on the radio, I might just decide to eat the radio. Check out the formentioned bands if you have not yet already, and if you're a newcomer to Zep get the second one, maybe the first, and Physical Grafitti isn't bad. Maybe even check out \\"House of the Holy\\". There's nothing wrong with that album, accept \\"D'yer Mak'er\\". Honestly, none of you big fans can justify that as a good song, let along an actual song. And the pretentious cover...
B0009I7NNA|4.0|This album is certainly not on par with \\"Waking The Fallen\\".  In my opinion, that is one of the best metal albums ever made, along with Vulgar Display, The Black Album, Burn My Eyes, The Dark Saga, As The Palaces Burn (or Ashes Of The Wake, maybe), etc.  City just doen't have the raw emotion, the screaming, the lyrics.  And City doesn't have a song on par with the stunningly beautiful \\"I won't see you tonight, part 1.     HOWEVER, City is a good album.  If you were waiting for a new Guns 'n' Roses, look no further.  Intentionally or not, these guys do G 'n' R better than anyone I've heard.  As other reviewers have suggested, if you don't believe it, listen to \\"seize the day\\".  If that doesn't convince you that there is some major likenesses to G 'n' R, get your ears checked.  I played \\"seize the day\\" for my wife and asked her who she thought is was, and she said G 'n' R.     The major difference between this and G 'n' R is the musicianship is far better than anything G 'n' R has or could come up with.  In fact, at times, these guys seem to be simply \\"wanking\\", a term some rock reviewers use to describe musicians showing off by playing technically difficult music.      And they do play technically difficult music.  Few bands feature EVERY member like this band does.  Listen to the drums, the bass, the lead and rhythm, the singer.  They all play a prominent role in the music.  I would agree with some of the reviewers who state the only weakness, as far as musical ability, is the singer.  He seems, at times, to struggle on this album.    As stated, the things that don't appeal to me that much are the lyrics--some of them are just plain cheesy, unnecessary foul language, and the lack of screaming.  Now, I know some of you are happy there is no screaming.  You are the newcomers, or don't mind major change.      I think I have an idea that may make us all happy.  For the next album, Avenged should put out a \\"clean\\" version, with no screaming, along with a \\"screaming\\" version, with... screaming.  It wouldn't be that hard to do.  If Shadows is concerned about his voice, they can hire a screamer.  Hell, I'd do it for free.  Call me, Shadows.  Anywho, let Shadows do the singing, and let the screamer do the screaming.    It wouldn't have been that hard to do on City.  Several of those songs would be to die for if there were screaming.  In fact, I would suggest to Avenged they rerelease City with some thoughtful screaming thrown in.    I will refrain from reviewing each song, as it seems people are all over the map on what songs they like.  I will say I like the first six songs.  After that, the albums gets significantly weaker.  On Waking, I could listen to EVERY SINGLE SONG, in order, and enjoy every second.    These guys, if they keep their heads screwed on straight (i've heard stories of major rock 'n' roll debauchery), will be around awhile.    Finally, Sounding is a four-star album as well, with lots of fine screaming.  Pick it up.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Not only is Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail one of the funniest films ever made and a classic of Western Cinema, the folks across the pond have set a new standard for DVDs.<br /><br />If you are a fan of British comedy or are the kind of person who would find catapulting a wooden rabbit funny, this is your kind of film.  I have yet to run into someone who has seen it who walked away disappointed; I have found far more people who will quote from it at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple: the gang are playing Arthur, Lancelot, Gallahad and others in the search for the Holy Grail.  Along the way Arthur has to use the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch to take out a killer rabbit while Gallahad (the Pure) has to be rescued from nymphomaniacs.  As a word of warning if this is your first time watching the film, the ending comes suddenly and you may be confused if there's more; when the music starts, the film is done.<br /><br />The features on this DVD are up to the high standards of Monty Python.  Although the film has not been noticably restored, when you get right down to it you don't watch Monty Python for the speical effects.  There are subtitles in several languages, including a set for people who don't like the movie (the subtitles in that case are taken from Henry IV, Part II, though they are out of sequence to go along with the action on screen).  They have redone parts of the film in Lego.  They have a sing-along.  They have an instructional film on how to use coconuts.  In other words, there are a lot of unique to bizarre features that will keep you entertained for hours.<br /><br />This DVD is a rare two-for-one: if you've never seen Monty Python before, it's an exellent introduction to what is probably their best-known work.  If you are a big Monty Python fan, you get a ton of features to entertain you, not to mention the film.  It's too bad other 'special editions' of films haven't been this well done.
B00005JNX0|4.0|I just went to see this movie last night with some friends, and it was so worth it!  The movie shows that it's tough when your (hungry) best friend is your main predator, but the best parts are the lemurs.  They like their dancing, and they are so funny!  And the movie wouldn't be any fun without the penguins.  It's on the par with movies like Ice Age--same type of humor, but with a lot less ice.  It's not quite as good as Shrek or Shrek 2, but it's still a really good movie.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|This film is presented to the viewer as it if it were real life which makes it so easy to accept it . It is one person's life and has a sort of FORREST GUMP feeling to it , as someone whose life is all accidental - that quality drives the film . <br /> <br />Ryan O'Neal plays Barry , who is a little like Forrest , but differs because he is a schemer and opportunist . Sadly he does not always think through the consequences of his actions . <br /> <br />The film takes its time , as it covers quite a few years in Barry's life , but is gripping if you will take the time to appreciate and settle into it . A lot of effort has gone into creating the period look and feel and that makes the film potent . <br /> <br />Well recommended .
B00004XMS0|5.0|I've been wanting to get these movies because when I was little I grew up watching Batman and Batman Returns. These two first films are the best and directed by Tim Burton he made the character so mysterious and sly which should always be the Batman fans love. The other two films are ok but they do not compare to the previous two, especially the last film with Clooney playing baman??!!! what were they thinking...in my opinion clooney is a bad actor, he has this character faces and voices that put in every chatacter he plays. he could play a retard person roll or play batman again and still would not make a difference. he is the worst Batman in the series. The best movie is Batman returns it has it all, the music is so well arranged and the shots in the movie, Keaton plays a great batman and the batmobile is the greatest. If you wanna buy this set of movies buy it for only the 2 first movies. or buy them separately.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|It had some good comedy lines & Matthew McConaughey is HOT! But beyond that it was still entertaining! Could have had a better title but it was a good movie!
B000002HEP|5.0|I was introduced to Kyuss through Queens of the Stone Age around 2001. I am just impressed as to why I had not heard about Kyuss earlier. This band is awesome. This album is amazing.<br /><br />Kyuss plays the kind of rock music that I like the most. If you are looking for heavy riffs, tuned down guitars and amps turned way up, this CD is for you. There are few vocals on this record but that fits the style perfectly because the instrumentation and musicianship is amazing and the vocals kind of lurk in the back and add an extra ingredient in the right places.<br /><br />This record is divided into 3 tracks, each one subdivided into more tracks. There are many styles in each track, heaviness and speed (Odyssey, 100 degrees), trippy and long jams (Space Cadet, Whitewater), great bass lines (Gardenia), and awesome drumming and guitar work overall. It also has the song Demon Cleaner which is one of the most famous Kyuss songs.<br /><br />It is incredible to note that Josh Homme was in his early twenties while he composed this record, which is impressive to think that someone can create this kind of complex music at a young age.<br /><br />Kyuss has been compared to Black Sabbath, but in my opinion they rock even harder.<br /><br />Welcome to Sky Valley, prepare to be amazed and get ready to rock! Please follow the intructions listed in the liner notes: \\"listen without distraction\\".<br /><br />Cheers
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Enjoyed this film a great deal, but I see what would disappoint many.  Sounds stupid, I know, but I bought it almost purely for the scenes filmed at Heathrow shown during the credits - very touching. <br /> <br />And for all of you Yank UK-philes who think that \\"real\\" British cinema wouldn't stoop so low, go to Amazon.co.uk and read the reviews there.  It might surprise you...
B000002AGE|5.0|This is an awesome CD for Jaco fans.  If you play or love bass, it's a must have for your collection!  This is according to Rich Fitkin, bass player, who I purchased the CD for. <br /> <br />
B00005JLSE|4.0|The DVD was scratched but they replaced for me and were easy to get ahold of!
B00008ADPF|1.0|I noticed that almost every band on the radio sounds alike. All rap sounds alike. All diva-pop sounds alike. And all radio rock sounds alike.<br /><br />I decided to download the \\"How You Remind Me/Someday\\" mp3 onto my computer for the fun of it, and I was laughing. Both songs have the same BPM, the same chord changes, wow, and I thought Creed was terrible enough.<br /><br />The rest of the CD isn't any good either. \\"Because Of You\\" sounds like something ripped off Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\", and \\"Figured You Out\\" has some of the most mundane lyrics ever.<br /><br />Nickelback's new album, \\"All The Right Reasons\\", hits stores really soon. Expect one of the songs to sound exactly like one of their older songs. Nickelback is a joke and a disgrace to Canadian music. Hopefully they will realize how terrible their songwriting skills are and retire from the music business.
B000A2H812|4.0|Just in case some are confused, the name is Gogol Bordello: Gypsy Punks. Eh, explains everything. The band from Ukraine decide to bring to America a bit of their take on Punk Rock. The type of gypsy punk that will make !!! (chk chk chk) worry about their indie cred being lost to Europa, and send System of A Down back to the drawing boards to punch it up a bit. (Gogol Bordello mashes Rock, Latin, Punk, Reggae, World, and a bit of Disco to go with it, creating their own sound for kids to take a few listens to get into.) The music meshes Punk and Dance Rock so well, that you can't tell who influenced them. Pinning the responsibility on Flogging Molly is a bit too hasty and to pin the Gang of Four is too typical for anyone to end up doing. There hasn't really been a band alive with violas AND an alleged accordion (especially an accordion) who can flawlessly mesh music and recreate the spirit of rebellious Punk so well.  <br /> <br /> One of the songs that haas a message quite amazing once you think about it a bit if \\"Think Locally, F*** Globally\\". Mostly, it is just the need to represent where you are, and forget any other place, making you suspicious of whether the song is sarcastic and less direct than The Vines' \\"F*** The World\\". If there has been a song that takes it over the top, it is \\"Young Again\\". The song sounds like they want to write Punk lyrics and recreate the horror sound of The Misfits. Also, the song \\"Start Wearing Purple\\", sounds like a good song, but amazingly pointless enough to become a B-Side. In \\"Immigrant Punk\\", leader Eugene Hutz declares this for the masses: \\"Despite the women of the USA, I am holding up in different ways.\\" But then again, saying they are over the top is the whole entire point of Punk. In fact, in a few years their hasn't really been a more original Punk band that kept the same essence intact. Sid Vicious would be proud. All hail \\"Immigrant Punk\\". (Notice I didn't say gypsy, and the overall album is going to need a few listensto let sink in for the newcomers.) <br />Rating: 7.5/10
B000002KY8|5.0|I am very satisfied with the 1999 CD by Prince.  It was in top condition when it arrived.  I would purchase again from the seller. <br /> <br />thanks
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This was Megadeth's last album released in the 1980's, and it is also considered by most fans to be their last true thrash album. \\"So Far, So Good...So What?\\" is my second favorite Megadeth album (second only to \\"Rust in Peace.\\") I might be alone in this opinion, but I do prefer this C.D. to its predecessor, (Megadeth's sophomore album \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\"). Every song on this disc (especially the instrumental) grabs me; this album is catchier and more contagious than \\"Peace Sells.\\"<br /><br />\\"So Far, So Good...So What?\\" hadn't aged well, and it hadn't stood the test of time, because when it was originally released, back in 1988, it came across sounding rather stale, because its production was pretty bad. Therefore, I think reissuing/remastering this album was a great idea. The result of the remaster made these songs sound better than ever! Like most of Megadeth's remasters (they reissued their whole back catalogue), the rough and raw sound of the original C.D. is gone, here, but the sound quality is clearer, louder, and all-around MUCH better.<br /><br />\\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" is the album's opening song, and it is also the instrumental. The whole song is very catchy (especially the opening guitar sounds), and a few solos are also included. It's not quite as good as Metallica's \\"Orion,\\" but this song is still very good.<br /><br />\\"Set the World Afire\\" should be titled \\"Set Our Fret Boards Afire,\\" because this song begins with really fast, running, almost buzzsaw riffs. Three good guitar solos are tossed in, (but the first one is pushed to the back, because this song's rhythm is so crunchy.)<br /><br />\\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" is a cover of an old Sex Pistols song. Some people like this cover, some people hate it; personally, I don't find anything wrong with it. It has catchy, chugging guitars and a nice sing-along chorus.<br /><br />\\"In My Darkest Hour\\" begins with soft strumming, but the electric guitars make a storming/pounding entrance pretty soon thereafter. This song becomes an almost skipping beat with trippy guitar playing, and it becomes quite speedy.

0553275976|5.0|In a life of great writing, for me this is Tom Wolfe's greatest work.  Its success was cataclysmic and was due in part to its perfection in timing.  It hit at the very moment when the self anointed \\"Masters of the Universe\\" were becoming exposed to the general public and the materialistic and hedonistic culture of the eighties was becoming transformed.  (At the time we didn't realize it would be a trade of the Culture of Greed for the Ravenous Orgy of Greed in the nineties.)<br /><br />This book offered wonderful phrases such as Social X-Rays, Lemon Tart, and so many more that you will be amazed when you re-read it or read the book for the first time.  It has a fascinating story that weaves together the cultures of privilege (for there are many) and the dregs of misery.  Each and every character is presented as someone with his or her own delusions of self, hypocrisies, and contradictory motivations.<br /><br />Now, this is not a novel in the sense of Thomas Mann or any other psychological writer.  This is a novel of social reporting that continues to stand the test of time and you will gain from reading it several times.  However, do NOT under any circumstances think that the movie made with the same title as this book in any way represents the wonderful things these pages contain.  The movie is a complete botch while the book remains a treasure.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Very funny, extremely silly, surprisingly violent with adult situations and a childrens fairy tale-like ending.  I liked it enough to watch it twice at the theatre.  Though I rarely watch movies twice, especially at the theatre, I knew my kid would love this.  So I forked over the wad and enjoyed it again!<br /><br />My eleven year old loved it.  The violence is cartoon-like except at the very beginning when the director is demonstrating how mean the gang is.  They shoot a frightened women in the back with a shotgun after they tell her they would never harm a female.  Of course, that is after they hack her boyfriends legs off with an ax and then finish the job in front of her.  Very funny stuff!<br /><br />The story is a combination of Kung Pow (by the way 'Betty' is the landlords husband) and the cartoon called Dragon Ball Z.  The good guys find better heros and the bad guys find badder rascals to fight the good guys heroes.  Eventually, there is the ultimate battle which is truly climactical!  The fight scenes were amazing to watch.  Very clever, energetic, creative, silly and fun.  Each battle gets successively better!<br /><br />It really works well because the characters are outlandish and colorful, yet sympathetic and real.  For example, one of the heroes is a cigarette-puffing landlady with a special power.  Another good guy is a drapery maker, who's fighting skill is related to his occupation.  I was drawn into their strange lives.<br /><br />The movie actually had a non-hollywood (Asian?) ending, which I guess was meant to teach a lesson or moral.  The good guys win!  It brings the movie full-circle and certainly made that first scene less important and gave the movie a fairytale ambience that I mentioned I liked in the first paragraph.  Feel free to reread it if you like.  Just kidding!  The ending made it possible for me to bring my eleven year old to see this \\"R\\" rated movie.<br /><br />I guess I should give it five stars.  But, there were a couple of scenes that seemed a little odd and it would have been better (for me) if the movie did not have subtitles.  Regardless, I highly recommend this entertaining film.ld have been better (for me) if the movie did not have subtitles.  Regardless, I highly recommend this entertaining film.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|Having never been a real fan of Death Cab, other than liking the song \\"A Lack Of Color\\", I picked up 'Plans' anyway.  I had always found DCFC's sound too slow, too melancholy, too depressing.  So I was more than pleasantly surprised when I found that 'Plans' was a bit more upbeat than previous efforts.<br /><br />While DCFC hasn't turned into Slayer, the band has seemed to up the energy a bit here on their new release.  Most of the songs are still pretty slow and quiet, but they don't seem as comatose as they previously were.  The lyrics are, as on all DCFC's releases, well-written and most definitely from the heart.  The music is still fairly sparse but doesn't meander as on previous efforts.  This is by no means an album to jump around to but it won't put you to sleep either.<br /><br />\\"Your Heart Is An Empty Room\\" and \\"Someday You Will Be Loved\\" are, I'm sure, destined to be big radio hits.  And \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\", besides being one of the best love songs written in recent memory, will be played at every wedding and high school prom for the next few years.<br /><br />I'm sure with the band's almost weekly mentions on 'The O.C.' and now finally signing with a major label that DCFC will become a very popular act in the mainstream music scene.  But these guys have definitely not sold out.  They signed a major label deal but they've still delivered a very indie sounding record.
0060528737|5.0|I never knew fantasy could be so powerful. Abhorsen takes it in strides. Each word reeks of brilliance, and the book is ultimately too good to be a book. I think therefore it could be made into a spectacular movie, and I wonder why it hasn't yet. Simply put this book deserves all the acclaim I can give it. If you haven't read the Abhorsen Trilogy, start it today, and don't miss this exceptional piece of Fantasy.
B00005JN5X|2.0|When Matt Damon's Will Grimm utters the quip \\"Its Not Magic...Its shiny.\\", he pretty much sums up the entire film 'The Brothers Grimm'.  For all of its lavish sets, beautifully rendered CGI, and eerie atmosphere 'The Brothers Grimm' is as muddled as its Enchanted Forest and as empty and bland as its dialogue.<br /><br />Damon, sporting a horrible wig and a phoned-in performance, along with Heath Ledger play the Grimm brothers as conmen scamming small towns out of money by taking advantage of their superstitions.  They get in some hot water with the French government and are forced to take care of a real supernatural problem in a small German town.  Once there, the brothers meet a beautiful tracker(Lena Headey), find the town missing ten of its children, and wonder around a haunted forest.  Then they go to work trying to rid the place of evil, only this time for real.<br /><br />The performances all around are pretty lackluster with Ledger, surprisingly enough(did anyone else see 'Ned Kelly'?), the only one to give a decent showing.  He plays Jacob as a neurotic, clumsy man with aspirations of greatness.  He, along with the sets and CGI, is the only decent thing here.  The war between the Weinsteins and Miramax show up in this much delayed film.  Apparently the controversy was over content and you can tell due to the film's choppiness, odd flashbacks, and sometimes confusing editing.<br /><br />Overall, the poor acting, muddled storyline, pathetic comedy relief, and excruciatingly boring first half condemn what could have a been a very good film to sheer mediocrity.  Skip it.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|2005 is shaping up to be a stellar year for classic pop craftsmanship and the pursuit of \\"the great song.\\" The new school are working from a perspective part folk song, part orchestral pop with sharp hooks, emotionally charged lyrics and gorgeous melodies. Unlike the recent trend of irony in indie rock or say the twee-ness of Belle & Sebastian, artists such as Sufjan Stevens, Bill Ricchini, Bright Eyes, Arcade Fire (actually a 2004 release) bring a literate sincerity that is as powerful as it is refreshing. Combined with top notch song writing and arrangements (all of these artists have a skill for string arrangements and brass instruments) 2005 is shaping up to be a banner year for \\"the perfect pop song.\\" Emotional, powerful, beautiful songs. Check out these titles which are the cream of the crop in new American indie rock.  <br />
B0000009RX|4.0|I bought this CD a few years back to replace the original vinyl I have. Thank God I still have the vinyl. Though an album I was weaned on back when it was released, I was totally surprised that during the \\"re-mastering\\" process of the CD, additional vocals as well as instruments were added to the CD, thus totally disrupting if not destroying the original. Apparently the original album as it was recorded is not available on CD, which is a shame. Yes, it is a awesome if not the best work Zappa ever did, but anyone who has the original album, hold onto it, and listen to the difference between it and the CD.
031286504X|5.0|This book is very well written. The lead story I am Legend is a great tale that breaks down what could be the hard science of vampirism. The lead character is solid and his tale is a sad one, his existence made easier only by the rituals he performs daily. I think the tale is very realistic and it even touches on his basic needs as a mortal man. The other tales are also very good one of my favorites being the one with the phone ringing in the man's mind. I think anyone that is a sci-fi and/or horror fan would thoroughly enjoy it!

B0001AP12G|1.0|The rap and back tracks for this CD are pretty average so it seems that the only way that Kanye could get market share was by taking cheap shots with the lyrics. At the same time we see these explicit lyrics artists rip at the system, the music really offers no hope. This CD is filled with self-righteous anger and is not very listenable. It is a cheap trick knocking segments of humanity to make millions and then ride home to your mansion in a LIMO! Disappointed that this artist has chosen the low road. Maybe Kanye should have stayed in college.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Ignore the on screen cyclonic ice storm causing a new ice age. The real disasters in this movie are the sensationalism, awful clichs, inane dialog, and gaping plot holes. <br /> <br />'The Day After Tomorrow' is such an awful movie, it really hurts the cause it trying to promote. It creates such a sensationalist and unrealistic storyline, even the most novice weather person would scoff at its veracity. This movie seems to say that by failing to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol (which was proposed 7 years before the movie came out), we are subject to an environmental catastrophe in less than a decade. If we only acted 7 years ago, we would be able to avert a complete change in global climate. Huh???  <br /> <br />'The Day After Tomorrow' focuses so much on its message, it really ignores common sense. The Dick Cheney-like Veep ignores warnings, and tells a scientist to go pound sand about the Kyoto Protocol. Later, when things go south (pun intended), the Cheney-look alike says 'How could we have known?', to which the scientist said something to the effect of 'I tried to tell you.' So, it appears we could have averted global disaster if we only acted 7 years ago. Once again, this movie not only presents unrealistic scenarios, but unrealistic solutions as well.  <br /> <br />The clichs are almost as bad as the message. After the tsunami destroys New York, and drowns hundreds of thousands of people, the Emmy Rossum character gently tells Jake Gyllenhall, 'thank you for saving my life...' Ugh! And lets not forget the comeuppance of the US, when it is time for Norte Americanos to cross *south* into Mexico. Who didn't see that one coming. <br /> <br />While I do not disagree with Roland Emmerich's ultimate argument about global warming, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is so unrealistic and sensationalist, that it is an embarrassment to environmentalism. The only thing going for it are the computer generated storms, tornados, and tsunamis laying waste to LA and New York. Just the thing for people who didn't get enough of the real thing on 9/11. <br />
0385510438|5.0|This novel is set in 1970s rural Ford County, Mississippi.  The story revolves around a 23 year old Memphis man, Willie Traynor, who drops out of college in Syracuse, New York, and with the help of his wealthy grandmother lands a job at a floundering small town newspaper in Clanton, Mississippi.  A short time later the newspaper goes belly-up, and Willie buys the entire operation, again with the help from his grandma in the form of a 50 thousand dollar loan.<br /><br />Having only his college journalism and some other insignificant writing experience under his belt, Willie attempts to make a go of the newspaper.  Soon after he acquired the paper, a horrific murder occurred which shook Ford County from one end to the other.  As a result of the newsworthy, headline making murder, and some strategic journalism, the weekly papers start selling like never before.  Subscribers soon reach over 5000 which is a huge increase in circulation.  Willie realizes a profit and much to his credit is able to repay his grandmother the loan plus interest.  However, she refuses the repayment and Willie instead invests the money.<br /><br />While Willie needed to learn some hard facts about the newspaper business, his true learning involved small town politics and getting along with people with views quite different from his own.  Willie is a bleeding heart liberal trying to stay afloat in a very conservative small southern town.  He manages to do quite well for himself, and after a while he even thrives. He writes personal stuff about the locals which is a huge hit.  He also takes a personal interest in some of the town folks namely one such citizen by the name of Miss Callie Ruffin.  Miss Callie is a self eduacted black lady from Lowtown with a slew of kids all of whom are grown and on their own.  What Willie finds unique about Miss Callie is that most of her nine children have earned college degrees.  A few of her offspring are even college professors and a couple are lawyers.  This deeply religious woman takes a real liking to Willie, and they soon cultivate a profound friendship which involved meeting every Thursday at her house for a home cooked lunch.  Miss Callie soon spoils Willie, but he does not take her kindness for granted.  When a local jury is selected for an atrocious murder, Miss Callie is among those chosen to serve.  She just happens to be the first black juror in the history of Ford County.  Later, when the jury members are in perceived peril, Willie worries about the safety and well-being of his friend, Miss Callie.  He goes out of his way to see that she is protected.<br /><br />Much of the story focuses on the murder of an attractive female, Rhoda Kassellaw, and her convicted killer, Danny Padgitt, who comes from a wealthy family who just happen to own their island in the vicinity of Ford County.  During the deeply emotional trial, Padgitt, against the advice of his attorney, takes the stand and really screws himself royally when he threatens to kill every last juror if they find him guilty.  The threatened jury, nevertheless, finds Padgitt guilty.  However, much to the disappointment of Willie Traynor, the jury decided that Padgitt should receive a life sentence instead of the death penalty.  Here the author takes some creative license by incorporating a 1970s Mississippi law which makes a prisoner who is sentenced to life, eligible for parole after serving 8 years.<br /><br />Immediately after the trial, Padgitt is shipped off to the state prison in Parchman where he is soon forgotten by the folks of Clanton.  Forgotten that is until he makes parole about nine years later.  Soon after his release from prison, one of the Padgitt jurors is shot and killed.  Then, a second one is murdered by a gunman.  The town starts to get nervous and begins pointing fingers toward Danny Padgitt as the alleged trigger man.<br /><br />Willie Traynor does a little research and found that three jurors were responsible for Padgitt receiving a life sentence instead of a death sentence.  Two of these three jurors had now been murdered.  The question is asked, why would Padgitt want to murder the ones who basically saved his life?  Some speculate that Danny incorrectly thought that the three jurors had instead voted for the death penalty.  Others theorized that the Padgitt wealth paid off the three jurors to ensure either an acquittal or a hung jury.  When they did not get the desired result, then the Padgitt's invoked their own death sentence.<br /><br />Anyway, much attention focused on protecting all the remaining jurors especially the third juror, Maxine Root.  Things are uptight and tense for several months with everyone on edge. Willie places much of his attention on his friend, Miss Callie, who also has the constant protection of her adoring children.  The jurors stay home for the most part and restrict their outside activities to a minimum.  Several months pass with no shootings.  Time is obviously on the killer's side.  After more time lapses, folks start to relax and drop their guard.  Miss Callie again starts going to church.  Things begin to return to some degree of normalcy.  Then it happens.<br /><br />Maxine Root receives a suspicious package in the mail, ostensibly a package of pecans from her sister.  She calls the law, and a deputy sets the suspicious package off in the distance away from the house.  He pulled his revolver and shot at the package.  After a missed shot, he hit the package which exploded to kingdom come.  Unfortunately, the deputy did not set the package far enough away, and several people were injured in the blast, including Maxine Root.  Fortunately, no one was killed in the blast.  Danny Padgitt was soon arrested.<br /><br />During Padgitt's arraignment something very unexpected happens which results in Willie taking an unplanned trip to a mental hospital to speak with a psychiatrist.  There is also an unexpected twist.<br /><br />My Opinion<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last.  It is a fast read that will keep you captivated.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story.  Also, I think this novel will easily transform into a major motion picture, if it hasn't already happened.gitt receiving a life sentence instead of a death sentence.

This song has everything...awesome melodies, great vocals, great solos and the insane drum work.  <br /> I hesitate to call it upbeat because many of the tracks are so fast, but it'll definately keep you listening and alert.  <br /> If you've never heard these guys, I would have to compare them to Demons & Wizards sound-wise, only much better.  <br /> If you are a musician or an old metalhead from way back, like me, you must buy this cd.
B0009TMZXC|5.0|This is a terrific, old fashioned, madcap, screwball comedy. Deftly directed by Howard Hawkes, the pace is frenetic from the get-go and never lets up. Starring Cary Grant, as a straight-laced paleontologist, and Katherine Hepburn, as an impulsive and beautiful heiress, this film is simply about as good as comedy gets.<br /><br />The plot itself is simple. David Huxley (Cary Grant), a noted paleontologist, is trying to get a philanthropical grant of money for his museum from a wealthy donor. In his quest for this charitable gift, he runs into Susan (Katherine Hepburn), who, unbeknownst to him, is the niece and prospective heiress to his potential philanthropist's fortune. Once David meets up with this madcap heiress, his life will never be the same.<br /><br />The film is noted for its highly improbable situations, its rat-a-tat-tat, stacatto delivery of lines, its frenetic pacing, and impeccable comedic timing. Toss in a missing dinosaur bone, a little dog with a fondness for such, a domesticated leopard (if there is such a thing), a not so tame leopard, a great cast and script, and voila, one ends up with a great film!<br /><br />Cary Grant is marvelous as David Huxley, the straight-laced, befuddled man of science who is drawn into improbable situations by Susan. Katherine Hepburn is sensational as Susan, the airhead heiress whose hair-brained ideas just lead to trouble. Of course, Susan falls for David, and the games begin. In addition to Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, the film has notable performances by Charles Ruggles, as big game hunter Major Applegate, Barry Fitzgerald as the hapless hired hand, Mr. Gogarty, and Walter Catlett, as Slocum, the criminally stupid town constable.<br /><br />It is with good reason that this film made The Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 best comedies ever made. It is an assessment with which I heartily concur. This is a superlative, vintage film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!
B000068TPN|1.0|This absurdly patriotic film is sickening. Obviously the creators of this film haven't read much of the bible (the whole part where you are to forgive your enemies and so forth).

0452287022|5.0|This gifted author weaves a mesmerizing tale around Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, creating an incandescent and luminous work of her own. His painting is a simple, though enigmatic, portrait of a girl with a pearl earring, about which little is known. The author, however, a born storyteller, creates a living, breathing story around it, using a singular, first person narrative. Told in spare, elegant prose, the author leaps into literary renown with this book.<br /><br />The events in the book are viewed through the eyes of Griet, a sixteen year old Dutch girl, whose changed family circumstances force her into taking a position as a maid in the home of a renowned painter, the taciturn Johannes Vermeer. There, the painter resides with his tempestuous wife, Catharina, their brood of unruly children, his commanding and shrewd mother-in-law, Maria Thins, and their loyal housekeeper and cook, Tanneke. The author lovingly details seventeenth century life in the Dutch city of Delft. It is here that Griet's story unfolds.<br /><br />Sensitive and perceptive, Griet is attuned to the under currents in the Vermeer household and, at first, takes care not to draw attention to herself. Still, she, the daughter of a tile painter, is curious about Vermeer's artistry and is drawn to his work and his methods. Vermeer, sensing a kindred artistic spirit in Griet, draws her into his world of paint, color, light, and beauty, creating an intimacy of the spirit between the two.<br /><br />Still, Griet, a girl on the brink of becoming a woman, finds herself confused and breathlessly desiring more than she may have. Her longing for more than a communion of the spirit with Vermeer is palpable. It is, therefore, not surprising that the undercurrents in the Vermeer household should come bubbling to the surface and engulf Griet, much to her consternation.<br /><br />This is a stunning literary work that fully realizes the promise that the author showed in her debut novel, \\"The Virgin Blue\\". She is an author that understands the less is often more, and she makes every word count. Deliberate and spare, her prose is lyrical in its simplicity, weaving a tale that will keep the reader spellbound. This is historical fiction at its finest. Bravo!The Virgin Blue\\".

B00006AUIG|5.0|I love horror movies.  I really do. I have gotten to the point where horror movies don't really scare me, as much as they do intrigue me.  Session 9 did something most horror movies can't do to me: IT FREAKIN SCARED ME!!!  It is one of the best done pyschological thrillers in a long time, and David Carusso's infamous \\"f*ck yoooooou\\" in the movie is one of the most chilling yet at the same time hilarious things I have ever heard.  The movie really tricks you with the ending and suprises you.  *KINDA SPOILER ALERT* It even made me question my own sanity, how one can think they are so sane but reality have demons of their own.   <br />If you love horror movies with twists and are sick of overproduced movies like the Ring and the Grudge, see this movie.  You won't regret it, even though you probably won't be able to sleep

B0001EFTVA|5.0|Having suffered through the painfully pretentious and shallow, pseudo-Lynchian mess of Perfect Blue, I was understandably skeptical about watching another film by Satoshi Kon (I have not yet seen Millennium Actress, but am now quite intrigued to do so). Tokyo Godfathers (a title which at first struck me as belonging most probably to a pseudo-psychological mafia thriller) was not only a pleasant surprise; it was the best anime feature I've seen in many years, probably since Ghost in the Shell, excluding anything by Hayao Miyazaki. Like the classic Grave of the Fireflies, Tokyo Godfathers struck me as unusual in the fact that it draws much from European cinema - English, Irish, German or Italian - while most commercial anime features try to mimic American filmmaking. But while Grave of the Fireflies was painfully sad and bleak, Tokyo Godfathers is irresistibly charming, and manages to be funny and incredibly touching at once like few anime films - few animated films, at that - ever achieve. <br /> <br />Tokyo Godfathers is remarkably non-violent, as pacifistic perhaps as Miyazaki's films. You won't find any grand futuristic structures or fantastical creatures here; in fact, the animation may seem crude at first. But the characters are where the film really hits its mark. Kon triumphs, like in his excellent series Paranoia Agent, by not succumbing to the accepted prototypes and standards of how characters should look in an anime film; the lead characters in the film are all gorgeously ugly, in a way that even Miyazaki had not yet dared to do. Even the child character, Miyuki, is chubby, and not cute and beautiful in the way little girls 'should' be, by the unwritten laws of anime. Thus, Kon's characters are believable and true to life; they are three anti-heroes, outcasts from society, each running away from their pasts. Especially charming is Hana (AKA 'Uncle Bag'), the golden-hearted transvestite, who supplies much of the film's comic relief but also some of its mosttouching moments. <br />  <br />Tokyo Godfathers - despite some far-fetched but amusing plot twists and coincidences - is at its core a very simple story, a beautiful little story about family, love and friendship. Few anime films are so unpretending; and thus, few anime films manage to be so strong. Watch Tokyo Godfathers; you'll laugh, you'll cry. And believe you me, ten minutes into it you'll forget it was ever animated.
B00008OWZC|5.0|It is rare that a live album has been able to break 5 stars for me or make me think \\"wow, that was incredible\\", How The West Was Won, however, is an exception, this album just defines great live sound, the band sounds so raw, good old fashion rock n' roll, Jimmy's improvization on the guitar is great. A must for every Zeppelin fan, even if you aren't Zeppelin's biggest fan you should buy this CD.

B00003CXI1|2.0|Harry Potter is a young boy with magical powers.  He lives with his nasty foster family until the age of 11 when he is taken away to Hogwarts, a school of wizardry, for training.  It is here that he discovers his true heritage.  Much like at the Boston pub Cheers, everybody knows his name.  Turns out Harry's family has made quite a name for themselves in the land of wizards and witches.  Eventually he and his two new friends - awkward, put-upon Ron Weasley and snotty know-it-all Hermione Grainger - come to believe that one of their professors is up to some shady business, and venture out on their own to uncover the plot. <br /> <br />What follows is an overlong, disjointed picture in which we are shown the many wonders of Hogwarts and occasionally, bits of an actual story.  Shifting staircases and talking hats may amuse the younger ones, but I found it all rather tedious.  The thrust of the story itself doesn't have much logic to it; if the sorcerer's stone is so precious and dangerous, why is it removed from the vault and placed in the care of an inept guard dog (and its equally inept master) to begin with?  The surprise villain isn't clever and serves only to trick the viewer.  Again, kids won't care, but adults will shake their heads in exasperation. <br /> <br />I liked the critters.  There are numerous owls of various types, a talking boa constrictor, a shape-shifting cat, and briefly, a large iguana.  And Alan Rickman (not a critter) is wonderful as always. <br /> <br />HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a juvenile film that I wouldn't recommend for anyone that is older than its main characters.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|Even though many people in the states have not heard of this truly great artist, I believe that she is worthy of fame even in the states. This is a great album and it is a bit more rock than the rest of her albums which I think makes this the best album she has ever made. Every track on the CD is great. I like the track \\"Welcome to my Truth\\" the best though. If you have only heard a few songs like \\"Left Outside Alone\\" and \\"Sick and Tired\\" and loved those, you will really love the rest of the CD.
0385513755|4.0|The 'boys own adventure' quality of the opening chapters certainly gets one in and produces a fast paced and gripping read.  That said, while one can accept the three opening statements of fact before the prologue, it is difficult to see how this relates to the following theory which is stated as fact.  Brown accepts that history is written by the victors and is used to present their views and actions in a favourable light and leads one tp believe that the Church has been the victor since Constantine.  Why then does history record the crusades and inquisition as a negative aspect of the Church?<br /><br />From my study of history, there is little to support the survival of any Templars after the executions ordered by Philip IV of France in 1314.  Further, I can find nothing in documented history beyond rumour to connect Roslyn Chapel with the Knights Templar.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a good read but not to be taken as fact.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I have always never liked music sung in Spanish and have stayed away from it, but I was drawn to this CD. It is great.  <br />It is also not to be underestimated. Listen to the whole thing once and you will see what I mean. <br />Shakira has real talent and is not a bimbo like most American artists like Britney Spears.
B00005JMYI|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" takes us back to those halcyon days of the 1970's, when the hair was as big as the lapels and women were just beginning to assume their rightful place in America's television newsrooms.<br /><br />Will Ferrell plays a Ted Baxter-type anchorman (is it mere coincidence that his dog is named Baxter?) - vain, narcissistic, none too gifted in the brains department - who has worked for years as the sole news dispenser at a top-rated San Diego station.  All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more \\"diversity\\" and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board.  Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news.  Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants).  Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy's professional territory.<br /><br />\\"Anchorman\\" is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like \\"Network\\"), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb.  The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial (\\"Panda Watch: Day 46\\") that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits.  Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in \\"Anchorman\\" ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever \\"West Side Story\\" parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.<br /><br />Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles.  Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.<br /><br />\\"Anchorman\\" goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now.  Still, \\"Anchorman\\" is fun while it lasts - and these days we'll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs.ody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.    <br /> <br />Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles.

B00006879E|5.0|I was in Italy when I first heard of this group. The song \\"This Love\\" was on the TV all the time, attesting to the greatness of it. I finally bought the CD a few months later and never regreted.  <br />THe songs are all very moving and have a clear powerful message. My favourites on the CD are \\"The Sun\\" and \\"She Will Be Loved\\" The songs are very moving to me.  <br />The lead singer has a very original voice and he does not sound like every other singer on the market and I like that.  <br />Mostly I love this CD because all the songs are loving and have a deep message and they show a dedication to \\"whoever\\" they are sung about.
B00080Z53O|5.0|One of those movies that is sad, but very well-done, humorous in some parts, beautiful scenery of Spain, and interesting because it is based on a true story.  It also made me interested to read the writings of the subject of this movie, Ramon Sampedro, which are collected in a book called \\"Cartas del Infierno.\\"  Incredible acting by Javier Bardem.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I personally tried to stay away from this Genre. You know, with people rapping and screaming and a lot of guitar. But, this CD is artisically very ingenious. I love it.  <br />The songs are very deep and full of meaning. I do not like songs that just stratch the surface or are very \\"teenybopper\\"-ish. This songs are really good.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Great! If you love Eagles - this one is for you. Only for some reason my Phillips DVD player does not play sound at all. Though, on my other devices it sounds great. Bonus is very interesting too.
B000002KKX|5.0|This was the first album that I heard from Christopher Cross. I fell in love with the simplicity and beauty of the lyrics. <br />The music is great and cannot be surpassed by any of todays artists. <br />The hidden gem of this CD is \\"Minstrel Gigalo\\" This is the best song on the CD and conveys such a profound message.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First off, let me say that I was not aware the CD was copyrighted. Somehow, I was able to rip the songs into iTunes and put it onto my iPod with no trouble what-so-ever. I must have bought one of the earlier, non-copyrighted copies. However, I will say that I am very upset that I wasn't able to put my Simple Plan CD into iTunes. I ended up buying the CD off iTunes just so I could put it onto my iPod. If I want music on my iPod, I'm going to get it, one way or another. I don't see how this prevents people from stealing songs. I would think this would anger people and provoke them to illegally download songs. I can't imagine hearing a person say \\"I'm so glad this CD I just spent $20 dollars on is copy-protected. I can't put it on my iPod or play it on my computer, but at least the Foo Fighters won't lose any money!\\" <br /> <br />Anyways, onto the album... <br /> <br />\\"In Your Honor\\" is an excellent album with music for everybody. The first disc contains 10 hard rock songs, while the second disc contains 10 soft rock songs that will help you relax after the seemingly non-stop rock on the first disc.  <br /> <br />Disc one starts off with \\"In Your Honor\\", a song with not much substance but a great way to kick off an album. It then goes on to \\"No Way Back\\", a song that Madden 2006 players will recognize when they hear it, as the song is on the game. \\"No Way Back\\" is just classic Foo, and this will most likely become a favorite of most long-time Foo fans. After \\"No Way Back\\" is the huge hit \\"Best of You\\", a song that is my personal favorite. The song starts off somewhat soft, then after a short pause blows up with seemingly unstoppable energy, complemented with the raw emotion in Dave Grohl's screams. When it seems like you just can't headbang anymore, the song slows back down to a pace similar to the beginning. It seems like you can finally relax...but then, the song returns to a force even stronger than we've heard in the song, and as the song ends you're left sweatingand breathing heavily. Next up, it's more classic Foo with \\"DOA\\", followed by a short, 2-minute jam called \\"Hell\\". Next up is a possible single called \\"The Last Song\\". \\"The Last Song\\" instantly became my second-favorite song on the album the first time I heard it, and seeing it performed live on MTV's \\"Backstage Pass: Foo Fighters\\" re-newed by love for it. After \\"The Last Song\\" is \\"Free Me\\", another good song by the Foo Fighters. The string of good songs continues with \\"Resolve\\", but then drops off a little bit \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\". However, the album is ended fittingly with \\"End Over End\\", another quality song by the Foo Fighters. <br /> <br />I didn't really like many of the songs on disc two, but \\"Miracle\\" and \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" are two great songs. <br /> <br />I recommend this album, but I also recommend you buy it on iTunes since most people seem to have bought the copy-protected version.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This movie is by far better than the rest of the Silence series. It is not just a pure \\"horror\\" movie. It is much more than that, most notably a deep, dark Romance story which makes it better than the rest of the movies in the trilogy.  <br />I love this movie. It portrays the beauty of Italy (I have been to Florence and it is just as beautiful as the film portrays it to be), the intelligence of Lecter which is one of the best characters ever created, and complexity of a very beautiful romance.  <br />The best facet of this movie though is the subtle love story. I am not a romance fan, but this movie is the crowning achievement of romance stories. <br />This is the best movie ever made. <br /> <br />Ta Ta <br /> <br />A
0515123447|5.0|I actually *do* read books other than technology non-fiction!  A regular reader of my blog emailed me and recommended that I check out an author named Lee Child.  Since there are a number of books he's written with the main character Jack Reacher, I decided to start at the beginning...  Killing Floor.  I now officially hooked and will be working through *that* entire series...<br /><br />Reacher is an ex-military cop who has gotten his discharge from the military and is now simply drifting from place to place with no commitments for nearly the first time in his entire life.  He decides to hop off the Greyhound bus outside of Margrave, Georgia, nothing more than a dot on the map.  He's into music, and there's a singer from way back, Blind Blake, who hailed from Margrave.  But before he gets very far, he's arrested at gunpoint for the murder of someone at a factory owned by a major citizen of the town.  Although he is able to convince the local detective that he's not the person, the detective has to put him in holding in the local prison over the weekend until they can get it all sorted out.  While there with another person who just *might* have committed the crime, they are both targeted to die in a prison fight that increasingly looks like a setup.  Once out, Reacher starts working with the detective and a local female cop, Roscoe, to solve the crime and figure out why everything seems a little \\"off\\" in this small town.  It becomes personal when he finds out that the murdered person was his brother who he hasn't seen in a couple of years.  The deeper they get, the more people surrounding the case start to get offed.  Worse, there's an obvious conspiracy involving the major and nine other townspeople, and the trio investigating the crime can't trust that anyone is clean or dirty...<br /><br />The whole plot and style of writing pretty much hooked me from the start.  Reacher, although a loner, is very human and works well as a main character.  His love interest, Roscoe, adds a certain tension to the book as you're not sure whether things will work out or if some twist is going to take you off in a direction you don't expect.  Once they figure out what's really going on, the story becomes even more interesting as you see how it could all fit together...<br /><br />Very, *very* good first novel from Child, and I can't wait to work through the other Reacher novels.  Good thing I have a vacation coming up soon.  :)Roscoe, adds a certain tension to the book as you're not sure whether things will work out or if some twist is going to take you off in a direction you don't expect.

B0002858YS|1.0|Their music is far too cliquey and overplayed. If I have to hear this band one more time, my head will EXPLODE!!! The songs at first were okay and tolerable at best, but after hearing them OVER and OVER, I just can' take it anymore. How did this band get famous???
B000002J5K|1.0|I just received this CD in the mail.  It is TERRIBLE!!!  It almost sounds \\"tinny.\\"  Like it was coming through a $6.00 radio.  There is a lot of background noise like a record has and there is almost no bass.  I gave it 1 star because it is the Blues Brothers and there are some great songs on it.  I also have the original soundtrack ordered.  I certainly hope it sounds better.
B00005RFAI|1.0|I bought this CD, thinking it would be a good CD because I liked the song \\"Don't Let Me Get Me.\\" The rest of the songs are awful, rife with curse words and have no beauty to them at all. Beautiful music should be HUMBLE and yet have a divinly beautiful message. This is awful and slanderous to music. The words are just an example of what America has done to its children. Even the song respect is not very respectful to people who want to hear clean thoughts. <br /> This CD is just awful
0385510454|2.0|I used to buy Grisham's books sight unseen.  After this one, I question whether I will buy another one.  The book was ok until the end.  It was like he had to make the book so many pages and then just quit.  It was totally unbelievable that all these bad guys just couldn't knock him off at the end for no good reason.  In reality he would have been dead in five minutes.  Please.  More books like The Painted House.
B00005JODA|5.0|Scary but so true political thriller that will grab you and shake you to your core with two very powerful performances by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes with an equally powerful direction by the greatFernando Meirelles. Rachel Weisz solidifies herself as one of the best actresses working today with a powerful performance that is not only mysterious but strong and compelling as well. Her performance is the highlight of the whole film and that quite a feat considering the fact that Ralph Fiennes gives the best performance of his career with a tight rounded character who is the anchor for the audience to go on this emotional and terrifying journey into the heart of real evil. He's a perfect acting partner with Weisz in every way and their love story is compelling and heartbreaking as well.  Fernando Meirelles gives the film an emotional edged that is equally satisfying and scary as well because he treats this story as kind of a documentary and by doing that, you are put into kind of a real life drama that is real to the point of feeling the emotions and the horror of what is going on.    This is the best movie of the year in my opinion, and I seriously doubt there will be a movie coming out that will mach the drama, the acting or the terrifying truth that this movie gives.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This movie is essentially a documentary about real estate agents and how similar they are to angels directly descended from heaven. We see these selfless cherubs offer their precious time to help us lesser folk buy investments in land, offering their assistance every step of the way. These virtuous spirits of real estate work for Wise Old Williamson, a kind godly like figure who generously gives them \\"leads\\" (a list of people that need help to buy property). However dramas arise when these leads are stolen and the angels become very upset as they no longer know who to help. After seeing this movie, I am convinced that any one working in the Real Estate industry should be Sainted. How else would we know what property we have to buy!
B00005JODA|5.0|I went to see this film today so I could get away for a while from the tragic images coming out of the hurricane-ridden Gulf Coast.  If there was one thing that I got out of the film, it is the fact that poor people are not given any respect in this society, whether in Kenya or New Orleans.  The film revolves around mid-level British diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) and his leftist activist wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz).  Tessa and his African doctor companion are killed in the beginning of the film, which was initially believed by road bandits.  But as the film progresses it is learned that Tessa was murdered because she found out that pharmaceutical companies, with the help of British government cronies, are testing dangerous drugs on unsuspecting Africans.  Unfortunately this is a very real problem as corporations use the developing world as guinea pigs.  In many cases pharmaceutical company will deny people important drugs to treat other diseases, such as AIDS, if they don't comply with taking these shady tests.  Because the vast majority of Africans live below the poverty line, many corporations think it is okay to take advantage of this.  The film also delves into briefly into the rights and wrongs of the Iraq War and the homosexuality of the African doctor (which would interestingly be a great subject for a whole other film).  While I thought the love story in the film was a bit sappy, I give the film high marks because I do feel it is important for people to know about the social ills going on around them.  Maybe as a result of viewing the film a few more people might want to get involved with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam or some other like-minded organization to learn about the issues.  After the success of Hotel Rwanda and potentially this film, maybe Hollywood is starting to realize that there are some people in the world that want to view films that have socially redeeming value.  You will definitely leave this film more informed about the real world, if not entertained.

B0007GAERG|4.0|I just put the CD in listened to the first 6 tracks and realized why I loved it so much. It has mass appeal and for that I give it 4 stars. Now call me biased if you want (I love Pop and R&B the most) but this album is the ****. It isn't her best album but it's my pick when I want to play through the whole CD! That is the big difference here. Keep in mind I'm a BIG Mariah fan. I'm the guy that's cried from listening to \\"All I Want For Christmas\\" at least twice due to some of the best composition in the world, IMO. Mariah is on fire. She may substitute fun songs for wonderful, timeless and emotional songs such as One Sweet Day, Looking In, Butterfly, Emotions, Vision of Love, etc. here but this album is mainly for dancing or bobbing your head to the beat.<br />Some hip songs, some slow love ballads and some personal ones.<br />Uptempo love songs is the focus. Now I hate to end this on a sad note but thanks to the haters I have noticed that Mariah's voice has waned quite a bit somewhere between the end of Rainbow and now. It totally shows on this album too. She hits the notes but with a screech. I don't know...I just don't know...
B000AU9UYM|5.0|wow! this movie is sooo cool. i went to see it the first day it opened and it was awesome! well worth the money, it's story was real good,the actors were talented at playing their roles,and christain bale is the best batman i've ever seen!keaton was overrated in his preformance in the first batman movie,but christain bale stays on top the whole time.the villians are a lot more real and creepier too!cillian murphy did a wonderful job at portraying dr. jonathan crane/scarecrow. four times better than spiderman or fantastic four......this movie rocks!
0345409671|2.0|I am a big Anne Rice fan, and I have been since reading \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" which I still think is her best book.  I have found some her books to be really great and entertaining reads - \\"Vittorio\\" and \\"Pandora,\\" especially.  Rice is so great at detailing a setting in time and placing her characters right in the midst of it, making you to believe that they truly belong there, pulling you into the story to witness the events unfolding.  And if you like vampires, then there aren't many writers better than her.  But some of her books suffer from long, boring parts that seem to ramble on aimlessly, such as \\"Queen of the Damned\\" and \\"Tales of the Body Thief.\\"  \\"Memnoch\\" goes farther than that.  The book is filled with pseudo-religious, pseudo-Catholic, New Age philosophy.  It reads like her own ideological discourse on religion as if told by the fictional characters of her stories. It's less a tale of vampires, then a discussion about religion. It's full of things that will truly insult Christians, from Christ sleeping with women to better understand human beings to the devil really being the being that cares most about humanity. The entire story is about Lestat finding out that basically the universe is this battleground, for lack of a better word, between God and the devil, each trying to prove the best way to save souls (Yes, that's right, the devil is simply misunderstood; he wants to save all of humanity!).  Lestat struggles to find out which being he believes is telling the truth.  In the book, God is callus and uncaring, for the most part, and the devil is the compassionate being, disapproving of God's methods in dealing with humanity.  The devil is the one that really wants to save people, all of humanity.  In the book, there is this Universalist, theological thread woven throughout the story, one that implies that everyone will be saved.  If you want to read a book filled with such religious debate, then this is your book.  It really has very little to do with vampires.  That vampires are in the story, seems coincidental.  She used her characters because, after all, they are the ones that she uses to tell her stories.  But it was a waste, in my opinion, to use them in such a horrible story.  Go read \\"Vittorio,\\" \\"Pandora,\\" or, even better, \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" if you want to read great vampire books by Anne Rice.<br /><br />One thing that should be pointed out: this is a fictional book.  You'd think that would be obvious, but is seems that some read this as it is a genuine religious text in and of itself.  It's a story about vampires, God, and the devil.  That's no more a religious text than stories about unicorns and leprechauns.  I doubt that Rice's intentions were to guide people to the \\"truth.\\"  I don't think she wanted to form a religion out of this book - e.g. L. Ron Hubbard.  Don't read it as such.  There are no revelations from God here.  Anne Rice is no prophet, and this book is no sacred religious text.  It's just a book, and not a very good one.vampires.

0800177177|4.0|The best Dracula move to date!!!      Only downside is that stiff Keanu Reeves...  everytime he spoke it made me cringe. Apart from this major downer, the film still overcomes this barrier with a dark, well scripted and directed interpretation by Francis Ford Coppola.  <br />Obviously Gary Oldman had a better dialogue coach than Keanu, mastering his transilvanian accent to capture the anguish, sorrow and pain that Dracula carried with him over the centuries. Without Oldman this movie would have been a surefire flop. <br />Coppola has remained true to the book and has created an atmospheric and visual masterpiece, but maybe should have spent some time with his choice in actors. The Region 2 DVD has a Documentary, Trailers and Costume Designs. 'Vhat sweet music vey make.' Enjoy!

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|The fifth disc, the live DVD is incredible. I had seen the concert before on tv and Michael performs well. Despite his lip-syncs in several songs, he can still show off all his crazy but hot moves. My friend Melissa viewed the DVD with me and she likes his talent but the shooting and editing of it seemed to bother her. She thinks it's ridiculous for any MJ fan to cry, scream or faint, even on camera. She also thinks that Jackson had gone a bit too far with his constant crouch-grabbing. And most of all the footage in Bucharest is mixed with footage in London, Monza, Toulouse, Paris, Lausanne and others to name a few. But still I like it and Michael is an incredible performer.

B0004Z33G4|5.0|It's violent,has a bodycount that has to be seen to be believed(Freddy and Jason ain't got nothing on John Rambo)an  over the top series of films with a simplistic view of the world and every fibre of my being tells me intellectually I should be above such tacky 80s hollywood action fare but goddamitt I love it!!<br /><br />To be fair First Blood wasn't really a hollywood actioner and was quite a well told story with an almost indepedent movie feel to it for the time (and no when i say independent i don't mean like napolean dynamite i mean in the 80s there were a lot of smaller films distributed a majority being of the horror/action persuasion though the action is generally more gory in these films and has nothing to do with two mismatched cops going to foil some bad guys)<br /><br />What John Rambo doesn't put into words he puts into his highly violent survival expertise,speaking of words it was with great nostalgia that I watched the second Rambo film as I watched this as a kid in the 80s on video(I had to get my cousin to hire it out for me because of the rating) my main interest being sparked when someone told me that Rambo mutters something along the lines of 11 words and kills something like 27 people<br /><br />I still don't quite know if this is true or not as it's a bit ghoulish pausing each kill scene and counting this is more the sort of pastime for someone about to climb a clocktower with a rifle.<br /><br />It's still great fun even if you don't read \\"Guns and Ammo\\" magazine.<br /><br />Poor Rambo III has fallen victim to everchanging world events and while a good movie at the time,who could ever forget Rambo on that horse with the big Russian helicopter coming after him?,sadly it's just too uncomfortable nowadays with 9/11,Bali,Madrid and London too watch Rambo fighing side by side with the<br /><br />mujhadeen no matter how good his intentions were.<br /><br />Overall though this boxset is a fantastic guilty pleasure I'd reccommend to anyone(except that guy about to climb the climb the clocktower with a rifle!!)he clocktower with a rifle!!)
B00000IMTF|5.0|What a great album! This is one of the premier heavy rock albums of all time. This is the stuff many 80s hairbands tried to copy with little or no success. Yngwie be damned, Richie Blackmore truly is one of the finest riff-masters of all time. Dio's voice shines as always. Hell, even the synthesizer parts are cool, and I hate synths. Buy this album immediately.
0440242576|5.0|I found this to be a quick, funny, light, enjoyable read. I made the mistake of reading this in May, instead of in late November or December, so I wasn't exactly in the holiday mood, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this book.<br /><br />Right along the same lines as Bleachers, this is a nice quick read, that won't require you to invest much time in it, as it can be finished in a single weekend.<br /><br />It was a nice escape from Grisham's normal niche of legal thrillers, that is very funny and enjoyable.<br /><br />This is the story of a husband and wife who are fed up with the commercialism of Christmas. After the husband (a CPA) calculates how much money is \\"wasted\\" on decorations, gifts, holiday excessaries, holiday cuisine, etc, they decide that it would be better to spend their expendable cash on a cruise instead. This doesn't sit well in a neighborhood that prides itself on holiday decoration and celebration, and the house without any holiday decor sticks out like a sore thumb. Meeting strong resistance, the husband and wife hold out for as long as possible, until something alters their plans.....
B0002OERI0|4.0|I mostly listen to rap until Green Day caught my ear. With \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\". I bought the album when the Holiday single came out.I loved the album but I hated the 9 min. songs. <br /> <br />American Idiot 5/5 Basicly the band making fun of modern America. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia ...... 4/5 I hate the fact that it's 9 mins long but the songs are pretty good. <br /> <br />Holiday 5/5 One of my favorites. See the video if you know what I mean. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams 5/5 One of my favorite songs. About how no ones ever there to help them. Amazing guitar beat. This song proves Billie Joe Armstrong is a spectacular songwriter. <br /> <br />Are We the Waiting 5/5 I don't really understand this song but the beat is bangin hook is hot. <br /> <br />St. Jimmy 4/5 About a boy named Jimmy. It reminds me of \\"Jonny be Good\\" by Men at Work. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine 5/5 About how only drugs can help you when everythings going wrong. Great song. <br /> <br />She's a Rebel 4/5 About him liking girls who are rebels and original. <br /> <br />Extrordinary Girl 4/5 A bad couple but the girl was a good girl. Billie Joe probably wrote the song about himself. <br /> <br />Letterbomb 4/5 The beat is blazing but the lyrics aren't quite up to par. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends 5/5 I love this song. It's about Billie Joe's father passing away. I like the video too. The guitar solo is amazing. My personal favorite <br /> <br />Homecoming....1/5 Uggh. Another 9 minute song.This time the songs aren't that good. <br /> <br />Whatsername 5/5 Good song about a girl that he meets that suddenly leaves him and married someone else. <br /> <br />My Top 5: <br />1. Wake Me up When September Ends <br />2. Boulevard of Broken Dreams <br />3. Whatsername <br />4. Give Me Novacaine <br />5. Holiday <br /> <br />Overall, this album would have been 5 stars if the 9 minute songs were all seperate.
B000062YAZ|2.0|Every song sounds the same, no different beats or nothing, just screaming and the same drum beat everytime. This album is terrible. I give it 2 stars just for reign in blood, because that song rulez!!!!! If you want REAL metal, go buy Metallicas Ride The Lightning
0783225881|5.0|A huge baseball fan, I make it a point to watch this every year, the night before opening day.  I then spend the summer watching the Orioles tease everyone, but end up with another lousy year. <br /> <br /> <br />The scene where James Earl Jones give the \\"They will come\\" speech really turns up the goosepimples. <br /> <br />This is bound to be a classic, and what a perfect ending.  I think every guy must get a lump in his throat when Ray finally gets to have \\"a catch\\" with his father.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|Megadeth is a great band, but they try to be like Metallica and they arent. Metallica murders Megadeth. But anyways this album is good. Gets boring after a while tho. Best song on here is \\"Symphony Of Destruction\\"       METALLICA RULES
B00003CXUM|5.0|I heard the soundtrack in my favorite music store. <br />It started playing just as I walked in.. <br />I was hooked right away and ended up walking out with my new <br />purchase. <br />At the time,I had never heard of anybody or anything connected <br />with either the movie or soundtrack. <br />To my surprize a couple years later,I pop in the DVD tonight,and <br />there is that incredible soundtrack ! <br />I can't believe it! <br />It fits the movie to a T. <br /> <br />The two main characters are so beautiful,and the colors and the  <br />music,well,it doesn't get any better than this. <br />Strongly recommended. <br /> <br />
B00000FCBC|3.0|Theres a couple good songs on here. The good ones are Whiskey In The Jar, Breadfan, Tuesdays Gone, and Turn The Page. This was the last album with Jason Newsted.....so sad
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I am a huge fan of Buffy and Angel.  Since this show is by the same people, I knew I would like it.  I simply underestimated just how much I would LOVE it. I couldn't help going on to the next episode until there weren't any episodes left.  The theme song is stuck in my brain and I don't mind it being there.  I am clamouring for more episodes!! Why was this show cancelled in the first place???  Can't wait for the movie.
B000002HRE|4.0|Nothing really great about this album. Fuel is the best song on here. This album is good but not great. If your new to Metallica start with Ride The Lightning or Master of Puppets before you get this
B00005JODA|4.0|I *know* medical testing is sordid; i have 'zippers' on both legs from attempts to repair my knees in 1954, 1959, & 1961 [it's now done arthroscopically].  i'm the reason you shouldn't take more than 1000 mg of Motrin/Ibrprufen/Advil [\\"Hello?  I know i'm not on the placebo & you need  to call every1 else in.  Why? 'Cause i just lost the peripheral vision in my right eye!\\"].  i **know** what happens when PETA throws fits about cute bunnies & kitties & puppies get experimented on - testing goes overseas or moves to prisons, both grim situations.  &, due to the number of 'scrips i need to take, i *KNOW* the pharm heads are greedy @#$%!s.<br /><br />So be forewarned, & you'll enjoy a lovely story - told in flashbacks - of a man who fell in love & how his search for the truth rekindles said love.  Indeed, the last word in this film is his heartbroken yet hopeful whisper, \\"Tessa.\\"  Ralph Finnnes is just plain brilliant as Justin Quayle, a diplomat more interested in plants than people.  But when his wife Tessa [Rachel Weisz, incandecently untouchable in a challenging role] dies in a remote section of Africa w/her companion, a black man she's been romantically linked to [another fine role played w/remarkable skill & preternatural cleverness by Hubert Kound&eacute;], Justin goes thru confusion, feelings of betrayal, then a different sort of betrayal & finally heartbroken, deep love.<br /><br />Recommended w/the above caveat.
B00000JLWW|3.0|James Cameron's Titanic is a beautiful story with commendable acting and etraordinary special effects. I will not waste any time on the premise, since everyone is familiar with it, but let it suffice to say that Cameron's vision of the doomed voyage of the White Star Liner is accurate in every way, shape, and form. <br />   The sheer scale of this movie is absolutely breathtaking, and the story, if predictable, is beautiful. But beneath the superficial grandeur of the film is an underlying ugliness that, though subtle, takes so much away from an otherwise wonderful movie. <br />   So what are the problems with Titanic? First off is Rose. The story begins with her engaged to the arrogant Cal. She does not love him, and is marrying him only for his money. She is unfulfilled by life, and is a self absorbed spoiled aristocrat. <br />   After she attempts to commit suicide, she meets Jack, who stops her from jumping off the side of the boat. They go off together, and have a wondrous time. Rose, an engaged woman, is deceiving her fiance and goes off with another man. The following morning, Cal has the audacity to be angry with Rose! Who wouldn't be? <br />   Rose decides not to go on with the marriage. But to inform Cal, she has Jack, a man she has just met, to draw her naked with the diamond around her neck. She then leaves the picture along with a cruel note in Cal's safe. <br />   When the ship is sinking, Rose gets into a lifeboat coveted by hundreds of passangers, with Jack still on the ship. Then at the last moment, she jumps out of the boat onto the ship to find her true love. How romantic! In truth, she is responsible for one other passenger's death. <br />   There are so many other flaws in this movie that the film's positives cannot overcome them. A beautiful story, yes, but a movie ruined by immorality and deceit, all by the movie's heroes. <br /> <br />
B0009QTS1M|5.0|So we all bought Gladiator when it first came out in it's two disk \\"signature selection\\".  While the movie is wonderfully done, the opening battle scene became the \\"show off your sound system\\" scene that those of use with DTS 6.1 systems used to impress our friends with.  So naturally, when the 3 disk \\"extended edition\\" came out, we had to have that too.  Only, WHERE'S THE DTS 6.1?.  This is soooo frustrating. Do I stay with my original 2 disk (no additional 17 minutes but DTS 6.1) or do I forsake that great sound for the additional foottage.   AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN THESE Two.  Come on people!  Can't someone get this right?!

0553573403|4.0|After trying and failing to find a good fantasy series in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, I was happy to discover A Game of Thrones, a series that breathes fresh air into a stale genre infamous for its cliches. If you can believe it, Martin's series has HUMAN characters with FLAWS. Not everyone can be herded into the good/evil categories. There's no messiah figure fighting a lord of evil.<br /><br />Instead you get a giant kingdom split into lordships, ruptured with violent intrigue, terrible plots, and even war. Across the sea, an army of Mongol-like warriors builds toward invasion. There is a huge cast of characters, with history, rivalries, and treachery galore. There's very little magic, but lots of knights and sword-fighting (and hot incest action!).<br /><br />It's a long book, but the pages aren't wasted. There aren't any superfluous story threads, like I've encountered in Jordan, Clancy, King, etc. (altho several of Martin's characters aren't going to really come into their own until the next book, apparently).<br /><br />As for the story itself, I won't say too much, because to say even a little would spoil a lot of the fun (don't you love books like that?). I can say that the big conflict involves two royal houses: one, the Starks of the north, led by the King's trusted friend, a noble and honorable man; the other being the Queen's house, vain and dangerous. The King, Robert, is caught in the middle. Who will gain power? Who will win the game of thrones?<br /><br />Because the cast is so huge, you may struggle with the beginning--I did, but many of these other Amazon readers didn't--though I can say that after a hundred pages or so you'll be into it in a deep way. I read the last 250 pages voraciously.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this one of the greatest works of literature, as some of the Amazon fanboys do, since the book does have its flaws. Thankfully, they're all small ones and nothing major. One sub-plot involves the Great Wall in the North, a 700-foot wall protecting the kingdom from wild people and dangerous creatures lurking beyond. It doesn't really make sense that the Watch is always sending out scouting patrols to die, since the wall is *seven hundred feet high*. Dude, just stay on the wall!<br /><br />Some more quibbles: magic is supposed to be absent, but somehow everybody's eating fruit while snow falls; blackberries, strawberries, etc. Huh? And Tyrion Lannister, the joker of the cast, keeps using modernisms in his speech: \\"Does a bear s** in the woods?\\" \\"...Thank you very much!\\" and more. There is superfluous sex sometimes, and too many master swordsmen.<br /><br />Aside from distractions like these, A Game of Thrones is a true feast for fantasy fans. It brings something new to the genre--maturity--and it will be loved by anybody who likes that pulp fantasy sword-swinging kind of big-book saga stuff.North, a 700-foot wall protecting the kingdom from wild people and dangerous creatures lurking beyond.

B0002858YS|4.0|I have heard many new male bands but not many are sticking out, but the Killers from their very first music video interested me. They have a vocalist that just sticks out; his voice is strong and gets your attention. Then behind him is a band that makes quite addictive melodies to blend with such a voice. Right after Mr. Brightside came out, a song that I just couldn't stop hearing when I first heard it, I bought this album immediately and found myself hearing so many other powerful hits on the album including the creepy- sounding but ever strong Smile Like You Mean It, the interesting All These Things I've Done (with an ever more interesting music video), Andy You're A Star, On Top and the fast- paced Midnight Show. These are the strongest songs on here to me and shine the brightest, and proves to me that this band is a lot more than just a fly- by- night male band we are always being fooled with. These men have more up their sleeves than just a hit or two, from the way it sounds to me they plan to stay and I think most of the music world cheers for them, I know I do. They have grown to be up there as one of my favorite male bands already and that says a lot for me, a very picky music person.  <br />I hope that their next album does not fail, it has been known a few bands get one great album and then fall through on their next attempt. Yet I like to think, from the strength I hear on this album, that they'll do just fine- possibly even better.

B0000C6E4D|3.0|I have never been a die- hard fan of Sarah. She reminds me of a few other female singers with such a strong and large following and yet when I rather excitedly tried them out, hearing such wonderful praise from them, they fell short to me, and some of them try too hard to be the opposite of Madonna or now Britney Spears honestly. Sarah I think is honest enough, and her independent sound I have always noticed, but when she carries it out in songs I've always found her boring, or just not my kind of sound. Matter of fact, I have heard two songs of hers that I have liked and really enjoyed only. The rest of her songs slipped through my hearing as nothing strong or memorable. And when Afterglow came out I thought yes, finally maybe a c.d. I can like from this overall interesting musician.     Well...again she falls short. I waited for three singles to come out, and luckily for sales those three singles were her three best songs on here. Fallen is a great song I love it, and this is the song that gave me hope that Afterglow could finally make me a fan of Sarah's, and then World on Fire and Stupid came along and I found the c.d. to be positive. Yet, before shelling out above ten dollars for such a c.d., I decided to be safe and rent it out at my library (we have a c.d. section with many popular singers and we can rent a c.d. out for two weeks) so I decided to hear the whole disc first. I expected a lot more than I heard, unfortunately. Most of her songs are very beautiful, but so slow...and so sail- like, if you don't understand I mean most of her songs just float along like a sail on calm waters, just going along slowly, nothing major happening, no sharp waters ever really coming to rock the sail. And to make this c.d. more interesting, it had to have a few rough currents, yet it didn't. I think one problem I've always had with Sarah is that her songs are not that explosive, and her passion, her own inner fire, only comes out once and awhile, and then the rest of the time she is just soft, and no offense but sort of dull. I think that's why I never got into her music. Where is her own fire most of the time? I don't hear it too often.     So yes, the music is beautiful, good to relax to, and for a song such as Stupid, very passionate, and suddenly you can hear Sarah's own fire; enjoy it on the few songs she has it on because most of her songs on here don't have what Stupid promises, or Fallen. Most of her beautiful slow songs are average, as if anyone could sing most of her songs just as good as she had because of the lack of artistic passion. Fallen and Stupid though show what I had not seen in her, which is her own fire, and it is just a pity I could not hear more of that. I don't plan on buying this c.d. anymore because of what I had explained, but every once and awhile I probably will swing by the library and listen to the Fallen and Stupid again. If only she could empahsize on the power of again like her song Stupid, I think she would make a new great album, one I would shell out over ten dollars for probably. The good thing is that Sarah finally interested me enough to hear a whole c.d. of her, so maybe she'll make me a fan of hers yet in the future possibly.

B000929AJQ|2.0|If you hate Nine Inch Nails, you don't like this CD and probably havn't even heard it. Don't review it. If you are a blindly devout Trent Reznor fan; you can't have an opinion of your own. Don't review it. I think that Nine Inch Nails are a great band and have done some excellent work. Downward Spiral and The Fragile are still two of my favorite albums. This album, however, fails to impress me. It has its moments, particularly the last three tracks. \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" is good until the end. I didn't mind \\"Sunspots,\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\" actually sounded pretty cool. The rest of the album is a problem. \\"Only\\" is by far the worst Nine Inch Nails song I have ever heard, it would ruin this album on it's own. For one thing the drumline sounds like the preset on my six dollar Casio keyboard, also the lyrics sound like a fifteen year old girl wrote them (less concerned about fitting into the world...you're world that is!) Also \\"With Teeth\\" has a terrible chorus as most of the album does. \\"All the Love in the World\\" tries, but seems like it's trying a little bit too hard; it just doesn't sound natural at all. The main problem is that With Teeth is just boring. Most of the songs on this album sound exactly the same, shallow, empty, and emotionless. I'm not looking for the Trent I remember from previous albums, I'm just looking for an album that sounds good and has some depth, this album doens't deliver. <br /> <br />I suggest not buying this album. Download some of the songs. If you really end up liking most of them then knock yourself out. Otherwise don't assume you're getting a quality Nine Inch Nails album. Try to start from the beginning, Pick up Pretty Hate Machine and work your way from there.

It has one difference from the VHS version, when Anikin appears at the end of Jedi with Joda and ObiWan, he is the young Anikin instead of the old Anikin seen on the VHS version. I love the DVD version for the great sound it offers on surround sound.

B0007N1AI6|4.0|Something that pleasantly surprised me is that listening to the new JP record gives me the same feeling as to when I listen to \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" or \\"Hell bent for leather\\". So, having low expectations I am pleased to say that Priest is back to teach the pretenders what metal is all about. This is easily Priest's best since \\"Painkiller\\" and that's no giving disrespect to the decent Ripper-era. Anthems like \\"Judas Rising\\" and \\"Demonizer\\" instantly brings to mind elements from their more metallic classics while the mandatory ballads help the record take a breather. Rob's voice isn't there as it used to, and understandably so. So, no high notes or long range screams, but enough power to give the songs an identity. The only weak song in my opinion is \\"Revolution\\" simply because it's too cheesy, all the way from the song arrangement to the actual lyrical content. Obviously, this is a better reunion record than what Iron Maiden did a few years back. The magic is still there, nonetheless!

B0002Y4TTC|3.0|This is a beautifully packaged 2-disc DVD edition from one of Germany's most successful power metal units. Disc one contains a full 20 song set, recorded live in Germany, of course. Most of the songs featured are from their latter albums, which I always thought lacked the memorability and passion of their first 4 records. However, in a live setting some of those songs translate pretty well. If there's anything that helps an uninsteresting song become absorbing it's a familiar, bombastic chorus and Blind Guardian has TONS of those. The sound of the actual show is easily perceptible to the ear. Disc 2 contains 4 bonus live songs, and several special featurettes, mostly in German so you'd have to set the subtitles on your player to English. If you're one of their thousands of dedicated fans you know this product is in your must-buy list. If you're someone who's curious about what this band is all about, I would recommend their first 4 glorious albums and the \\"Live in Tokyo\\" lp that came after to truly appreciate their essential craft.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Mind numbingly bad Keanu Reeves film that makes you want to tear your hair out with Keanu giving his career worse performance and most of the actors giving theirs as well. The story is a clear rip off of horror movies from the past and it makes even the viewer feel stupid after it's all over. Only Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare are able to transcend their badly written characters and that's because they are too good of actors to be even in this mess. They are giving way too much talent and class to a film that has none of their qualities. <br /> <br />Hopefully Weisz, Housou and Stormare will learn to read their scripts better after this debacle  <br /> <br />
B00005JKN9|5.0|Picture that friend of yours who falls asleep during action movies.  He's always complaining about the clichs, the watered-down plot, the hackneyed action sequences.  Gangs of New York is what that friend might dream up given a Hollywood cast and limitless freedom.  I was expecting a gaudy, eye-rolling showcase for Diaz and DiCaprio's pretty faces.  Instead I witnessed a down-and-dirty masterpiece with inspired acting, dazzling writing, and bold camerawork.  The script doggedly avoids empty-headed clichs, instead inventing classic lines for future copycats.  One memorable scene takes place on a body-strewn battlefield in the Five Points.  Bill the Butcher, folding a blood-stained knife into the hands of a fallen priest, says with dutiful respect: \\"you'll need this to cross the river.\\"  Even the voice-over work in Gangs is fresh, binding the meaty chaos with barbed-wire eloquence.  It's a pity some critics label the movie \\"indulgent\\", simply because it dares to sustain virtuoso vision for nearly three hours.  We should be so lucky to have this-a Hollywood movie that bleeds when pricked.  It is rare to have characters we not only care about, but whose conflicts and relationships are unapologetically human.  Here is a conniving monster with a heart, and a hero who becomes his son.  And why was it news to some that the film is not 100 percent historically accurate?  This is a story.  A story that ignites as grisly, glorious nightmare the way only film can.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan's latest album vacillates musically from soul-searching folk tunes to big, complex, multi-layered production numbers that would be perfectly comfortable in a broadway show.  It is an entralling emotional journey that takes us to the depths of Sufjan's darkest moral nadirs to his most triumphant and hopeful epiphanies.<br /><br />Never before has an album struck me as being such a complete statement about the human condition.  Perhaps it is Sufjan's Christian faith (which is slightly less of a focus on this album than on the two previous albums) that allows him to hold such an odd combination of despair and distress supplemented by boundless hope for the future.  Take this as a lesson for the bland musical artists who market themselves to the evangelical Christian crowd, Sufjan's music is what you can do when you simply let your faith inform and inspire the music rather than just use the music as a cheap evangelization tool.  (I should be sure to say that despite the obvious Christian influence, this is not preachy music and it can be -- and is -- enjoyed by persons of all faiths and no faith at all.)<br /><br />The songs are all loosely based on historical and geographical trivia of the state of Illinois.  As with his previous album \\"Michigan\\", Sufjan uses these structures as a jumping-off point for a more complex exploration of the human experience.<br /><br />Musically, Sufjan employs a variety of styles.  Some of the tracks are relatively simple acoustic folk arrangements.  Other tracks, such as \\"Come on Feel the Illinoise\\", \\"Chicago\\", and the powerful almost-finale \\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders\\", exhibit compexity in layered arrangements supported by orchestra and horns and a full chorus.  Syncopated rhythms and uncommon time signatures are employed to their fullest.<br /><br />The album cannot be described adequately in words, because so much of its power is in its undeniably magnificent emotional impact.  It is pure beauty.  It is not overstatement to say that it will surely be considered a candidate for greatest album of 2005, and I believe it may be the greatest album of the decade thus far.overstatement to say that it will surely be considered a candidate for greatest album of 2005, and I believe it may be the greatest album of the decade thus far.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|There's so much I'd like to write about this movie, but I can't. I don't want to give even the slightest bit away. Yeah, it's cheap, I know, but I saw it with pretty much a blank slate and I think that's absolutely the best way to do. You must see this movie. Then come back and read some of these reviews, like I did (some of the reviewers give away WAY too much, I felt).  <br /> <br />This movie is a feast for all the senses. Christian Bale plays a frighteningly emaciated industrial worker lives like an apparition in a washed out, grimy world. This reminds me of Orwell's vision of postwar England as portrayed in \\"1984\\" - grim, bleak, washed-out, bleary-eyed, ephemeral and unreal, like being stuck in a perpetual hangover in an old war zone. For a while this movie was billed as a \\"horror\\" movie but it's really psychological horror that manifests itself in a few conventionally horrific ways. It does have similarities to \\"Sessions 9\\" as others have pointed out, by the same director. Internal angst and self-discovery juxtaposed against a decaying old backdrop.  <br /> <br />This movie is like what Henry James might have written if he were alive today! The cinematography is great, the settings are excellently done and quite creepy and unsettling, even as they are familiar. And the music! The music is great, it's about time someone gave some love to the theremin again. The acting is top-notch from everyone involved, especially Christian Bale. A scene-grabber for sure. <br /> <br />Every facet of the movie was executed in a professionally frightening and somewhat hallucinatory manner. But don't be fooled by that term. There really is very little David Lynch and such style in this movie, in my opinion. It does more showing and less telling, yes, but it does so in a more straight-ahead approach with less cloying. If the movie has a weakness, which it may very well not, it's the ending; however, I congratulate the writers, because this was an extraordinarily difficult movie towrite a conclusion to that doesn't cheat the audience or leave things too open-ended (the famous \\"draw your own conclusions\\" ending that give critics something to rave about and writers and easy out). <br /> <br />In conclusion, \\"The Machinist\\" deserves 5 stars on virtually every level, and as a whole. Watch it as soon as possible, I don't think you'll be disappointed, and I'd be surprised if anyone feels \\"cheated\\" like you do with some ambitious movies.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Their best has to be either \\"Photo Album\\" or \\"Transatlanticism\\" but as I said, this one is definitely Top 3 material here! I heard a bit of the album before release and knew that they definitely changed the style a bit (a little Postal Service influence is there as well as the older stuff). \\"Soul Meets Body\\" is definitely hit-material for sure, the other songs most likely will get played out and become Top 40 Material in no time, further pushing them into the limelight and they will become the next Green Day (BLEEEEEEEEEECHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Sorry, going off into my hate over Top 40 radio! Anyway, go out and buy every single Death Cab album you can get right now and enjoy them!!!!!
015626224X|5.0|But be warned: I think nowadays this book is more suitable for three groups of readers: those who have an interest in novels of the picaresque; those with a historical interest in Paris, or to a lesser extent, London; or general fans of George Orwell's fine works. <br /> <br />I fit into all three of those categories. This is a great novel for so many reasons. It gives you a historical sense of the picaresque novel. Before Chuck Palahnuik, Chuck Bukowski, or even William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac were writing stories about the tragic/comedy/just plain interesting adventures of the down-and-out, George Orwell was here. This book can be seen as a blueprint for more recent works - it has definite parallels and similarities with Burroughs' \\"Junky,\\" Bukowski's \\"Factotum,\\" and even Palahnuik's \\"Fight Club.\\" <br /> <br />It's also a great historical work. It is largely autobiographical. The adventures of poor artists in Paris has long been a fascinating, and autobiographical, subject in literature. From the drug binges of Charles Baudelaire, to the fictional-but-based-in-true-experience of the poverty-wracked (among others) faithfully portrayed by Balzac, to Picasso and Modigliani's frolics in Montmartre, to Louis-Ferdinand Celine's justifiable famous portrayal of World War I Paris (and other environs) in his tour-de-force \\"Journey To The End of the Night,\\" to Henry Miller's debauchery in the city of lights as most famously noted in \\"The Tropic Of Cancer,\\" Orwell's novel here has many peers (Henry Miller was one) and precedents. If any of these subjects interest you, then I suggest you check out this book. <br /> <br />It's also good for Orwell fans in general, and it contains more of his trademark warmth and cynicism; his segues into politics; and his tongue-in-cheek examination of the bizarre and absurd. <br /> <br />Finally, this is just a great book, period. This novel is based on a time in his life when he dropped out of respectable society and moved into a ramshackle residental hotel in Paris to get a taste of lower class Parisian life. His experiences as a poverty-stricken hotel restaurant worker are stirring, gripping, absurd, tragic, and comedic. They run the gamut of emotions with a cast of many odd characters of every walk of life: hustlers, exiled Russians, meglomaniacal cooks, Oscar Wilde-emulating starving artists, and many more. As others have noted, the breakneck, full-throttle insanity of Paris is much more fun to read about than the staid, rather boring London. It's like going from San Francisco to Salt Lake City (no offense to those hailing from Utah). Even though this book was written long ago, it's highly readable, and a fantastic insight into the human condition, of what it means to be human in a certain period of time, and how people live their lives and get by in the face of seemingly impossible odds. <br /> <br />I highly recommend that everyone read this book.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Some movies just have to been seen twice.  The 2nd time around, I know where we're going and I can concentrate on the nuances and details I missed the first time.  It helps of course that I happen to agree with 90% of the observations made in this movie about reincarnation and such.  It's a statement about the power of love.
0143034901|5.0|I just finished reading Elizabeth Kostova's \\"The Historian\\" (which is a fine read), and a friend recommended The Shadow of the Wind.  Let me say that this novel is far superior to The Historian, and may be on of the best read I've had in years.  The intricacy of the plot line, the somewhat gothic/haunted ambience, and the witty and often hilarious dialogue work together to create a story that is both compulsively readable and thought-provoking at the same time.<br /><br />I won't let you in on the story...just pick this up and prepare to be charmed!
B0009X766Y|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining films ever made. Everyone in this film is superb and you have to watch it several times to understand all the twists and turns. When you watch it with someone who has never seen it before and they get to the end, what a joy to see them whoop in excitement.
0380789035|5.0|I loved this book.  It is comedic, interesting, and most of all, it makes you think.
B00007G207|5.0|If you don't cry at nearly every scene in this movie, you are made of stone. And if, like me, you do not need the English subtitles, be prepared to need a whole day to recover from the emotion of this wonderful Italian film.
B0009RCPY8|3.0|The remaster screwed up the colours of Ghosbusters 1 and the cut-down menus look cheap. Also, the packaging is ugly. On the other hand, the booklet is cute and the two real ghostbusters episodes are welcome. However, I still feel that this release is worse than the 1999 one.
B00005JL95|5.0|I am very happy with the item I received. The video is just like new.
B00005JN5X|2.0|I had moderately high hopes for this film going in, but was sadly disappointed. At first I thought it would be pretty good because the film opens well and it seemed to have an interesting premise. But it quickly turned into a silly movie with characters that I just could not bring myself to care about. I suggest skipping this one; it's a rental at best.
B00005JODA|1.0|A leftist activist fights the good fight against evil big business on behalf of poverty stricken AIDS patients.  Gee, this is really original Hollywood fare, isn't it?  Her alliance with a gay African doctor rounds out the politcally-corrrect cast of characters. I expected much more than the same old hackneyed left-wing tripe this cliched formula movie serves up.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I just found this in my sister's collection a couple of days ago, I never really had an intrest in another Cinderella story, but I was shocked as to how good it really was. I loved it that they gave an excuse as to why she puts up with all of this. Because she has no one eles. This the closets thing she has to a family. Drew Barrymore hits all the right notes, as VERY likeable Danielle and Anjelica Huston is also very good in it. Check this movie out, GREAT MOVIE!!!!!
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth never fails to deliver the most diverse, talented & creative metal out there.Every one of their albums is AWESOME & this is no exception.  If you like any of their other albums you'll love this one.  (Unless you've only heard Damnation, in that case be ready to get your ass rocked off).  BUY THIS ALBUM.  Along with all the rest of their albums, don't miss one or you're missing out on some great music!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|There are so many good points about this DVD set. Fanatastic picture, sound, and the horn section really adds a punch to the songs. All of the band and the musicians are in top form and there is an unbelievable amount of music packed into these DVD's. Simply a must for Eagles fans, especially ones (like me) who couldn't afford concert tickets.That said, I think the people that easily dismiss Don Felder are way off the mark. The Eagles really reached a musical plateau when Felder joined the band for the \\"On The Border\\" sessions. He is a tremendous guitar player. When Walsh joined, the band had 2 tremendous guitar players who really played well off of and with each other. A hired giuitar player ( like on this CD) cannot duplicate the interaction that Walsh and Felder built up over the years. It's the one thing I really misssed here. I don't know what happened to Felder and why he was dimissed from the band, but I know I wish he was still there.
0060930187|5.0|It's an interesting look at how some one who originally wouldn't be considered crazy today was driven to semi insanity and a suicide attempt by an oppressive society. She didn't want to fit into the standard role expected of women at that time, for example, she tells a male character that she never wants to get married, to which he responds ,\\"You're crazy\\". She is later assualted and continually prohibited from doing what she wants because she is a woman, which is partially to blame for her break down.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Please do NOT believe the people telling you that the vocals aren't different, because they quite clearly ARE different. I don't know, i really know f-all about professionally recording vocals and remastering and remixing old albums, but on, for example Take No Prisoners, the vocals are NOT the same as on the original album. This is obvious. This is as plain as the nose on your face..... unless you have no nose, in which case, my sympathies. Yes yes, of course all of the album vocals sound different, in that \\"the whole album, vocals and all have been remixed, polished and remastered\\" way. Of course. Otherwise it would be pointless. But the vocals on Lucretia and Take No Prisoners, to take two songs as examples, are NOT simply remixed and remastered. They sound different, are sung differently and for goodness' sake - some of the words are different! (even if only slightly, and barely noticably in some places). If they have simply been remastered and overhauled, well..... wow, they must have some machine that changes words as well. O_O I (obsessively) know this album. I know every snarl, every single word and exclamation, every vocal 'noise' made and the exact way in which every song is sung. No, i'm not trying to be a (sad) smart ar**, i'm simply trying to tell you that it is clear to anyone who is into this band and in particular this album like i am, that certain parts of this album have different vocal tracks from those which appeared on the original release of Rust In Peace. That's all. Whether they were re-sung in '04, whether they are different tracks taken from the original recording sessions.... whether an ALIEN trying to imitate Dave Mustaine recorded them - they are different. Anyone telling you different either needs to get their hearing checked, or seriously believes that they are the same..... just remixed..... with different words? Anyway, Whether you like them or not is down to your own opinion. I hated them at first, now i'm into them. As for which songs have different vocals on them.... hell, some are hard to tell, to be honest. Take No Prisoners - definitely. Five Magics - definitely (this is one of the songs where some of the words are different) Lucretia - definitely. (i think it's done very well) Rust In Peace...Polaris - i can tell that little bits are sung and pronounced differently. Therefore, how can they be the same. (just listen to the bit after the second verse, that starts with \\"I rule on land air and sea....\\" (it's obvious it's different) On the whole though, i think they've just polished, remastered and remixed the vocals. Don't worry, not every track has different, crappy vocals. There, not very interesting, but i just wanted to say that some of this album is using different vocal tracks than the original release. It's plain as a 747. :D
B00005221M|5.0|Reminiscent of the 1936 movie that is also loosely based on Cooper's classic--luring music, epic battle scenes, riveting suspense, and continuous action, make this 1992 version of The Last Of The Mohicans a crowning success. Here is a sweeping romance that will thrill Daniel Day-Lewis fans--as he gives one of his best performances, braving the worst for his lady as he declares: \\"I will find you!\\" And finds his Cora in the end.
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is in my humble opinion the greatest rock album after paranoid by black sabbath and led zeppelin's fourth album.this contains my favourite songs like ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL and COMFORTABLY NUMB.hugely recommended.

0345404475|5.0|Philip K. Dick's usual satiric touch was absent from this gray-toned storyline that reads like something Poe might've written had he been born a century later. Set in a troubled future increasingly matching our realistic expectations, this novella tells the story of the most human-like artificial life forms ever created and of the consequences of crafting \\"machines\\" too much like ourselves. In taking on elements of philosophical musings, Dick clearly intended for us to ponder the same questions Mary Shelley had in mind when she authored Frankenstein two-hundred years ago: namely, at what point does existence become life, and what is it that defines a soul or the absence of a soul? This book is not the movie Blade Runner set in paper form, nor is Blade Runner a diminutive version of this book committed to celluloid. Each stands separately in the arenas of its distinct flaws and virtues, but one does not augment the other. These are two different tales here despite their similarities. A highly Gothic brand of science fiction is what this book presents; its film noir themes radiate with cat and mouse game suspense and more twists than the Blade Runner had. It is also more adept at granting pauses for contemplation than the time limitations ever let Blade Runner offer. The ending is also...unexpectedly unique here in Dick's work. I won't discuss it except to say what I've been saying in here all along: don't expect the same ending shown on film.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|A lot of people are complaining that Closer isn't a perfect happy love story, but that's the whole point. This isn't some dumb, cheesy romantic comedy full of things that never happen, this is a look at how tons of people unfortunately really do treat each other. I think it's realistic and intelligent. I particularly liked one of it's little lines in the previews that said \\"If you believe in love at first sight then you never stop looking\\". The movie definitely explores that idea and it's a relevant one considering the amount of infidelity in our society.
B00009TB5G|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  Part of the best trilogy ever brought to film.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is the best CD I've ever purchased. My Chemical Romance is abosolutely brilliant. Every song on the album is unique and different and Gerard Way, the lead singer, sings with so much passion and emotion that every song is a masterpeice of art. I can't stress in words how great this CD is. My Chemical Romance is truly the best band ever.
0553213105|4.0|This novel grabs you so hard that you just want to know what is going to happen next and why is Darcy and Elizabeth acting this way, what is the deal with all this pride and the prejudice?Even though that their life style in the novel in general does not seem very exciting like our present life style; however I think they were much more sophisticated than we are; they all read, write letters hence mastered the art of writing, and they all can play the piano! nice. in short, the novel is brilliant! that is it!
B00005NGAL|5.0|I was very happy with the DVD and how quickly it arrived.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|You know something? Those of us who live our lives in the sunlit spaces of what we call \\"Normalcy\\" don't have a clue about the deep, dark, furiously deadly undertows all about us.<br /><br />Most do their 9-to-5 routine, pay their bills, take care of their taxes in an annual routine of Dread, nurture families, make and break friendships, launch and end affairs, and a million other exigencies of life, all while getting their food---caught, fattened, slaughtered, and packaged, ultimately bearing little resemblance to a beast or fowl---from well-stocked superstore shelves.<br /><br />We live in such a state, a highly unnatural state, because our Rulers have enlisted King Cobras to go forth and do our battles for us. Proxy warriors.<br /><br />They slip through the streets of a million metropolises, plumb the information oubliettes of a bilion backwater dive-bars. They are professional Killers, and you'll only see one of them about 1/5th of a second before you breathe your last breath.<br /><br />As one CIA analyst says, \\"these people do not make mistakes.\\" They don't have time to: the world they do their bloody business in is fast and brutal, operates by the Law of the Microchip, and is unforgiving as Hell.<br /><br />James Bond? Please. By the time Bond was halfway through one of his droll quips he'd be dead in the real world.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, whose Bourne is both kinetically, cracklingly alive and still calm and calculating), until recently, was one of those King Cobras.<br /><br />Still suffering from partial amnesia, not wholly confident in what he may have done for the infamous CIA \\"Treadstone Project\\", haunted by nightmares, Bourne and girlfriend Marie (the lush Franka Potente) are a world away from the events of \\"Bourne Identity\\", submerged beneath new names (though not faces, alas), tucked away in a remote corner of India.<br /><br />Except, as Bourne finds out, when a Berlin CIA operation goes bad and Trouble comes calling with hollow points, there ain't any such thing as remote.<br /><br />Framed for a murder he didn't commit, implicated by fingerprints that aren't his, dimly suspicious that Treadstone may still be up and running and looking for blood, Bourne runs himself to ground in Naples, using his own passport---and the Hunt is on.<br /><br />Both \\"Bourne\\" movies are prime examples of how *to* make a good espionage thriller: \\"Supremacy\\" is smart, fast, edgy, and deadly, like a John Le Carre novel told from a field agent's point of view. There is little, if any, margin for error: make a mistake, trigger the men in black *and* the local fuzz, and you won't be making it back to the hotel for a late night Martini, shaken not stirred.<br /><br />The plot? Suffice it to say that it involves Russian mobsters with Langley connections, and that it is partly about revenge and substantially about getting answers. That's all you really need to know.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, \\"Supremacy\\" is shot with skill and authority: like its cold-bloodedly efficient killers, \\"Supremacy\\" Director of Photography Oliver Wood doesn't have to plump up the material with showy techniques. His camera moves in for the kill, arcs over to its target, jounces along after the subject like a war photographer when it must, and gets the job done.<br /><br />It's amusing that some have complained about Wood's cinematography: he did the camera-work for \\"Identity\\", and (rejoice!) will be helming the shooting for \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\". I'm not a big fan of jerky camera-work and so I was bracing myself for this film; with a widescreen print of the film and a proper widescreen TV, the only time the camera bounces around is when it wants to enhance the action.<br /><br />Ultimate credit goes to Peter Greengrass, who takes the directorial duties away from \\"Identity\\"'s director Eric Lyman. Greengrass has a fine sense of what works, and subordinates everything in \\"Supremacy\\"---the use of lighting, the frenzied chases through Berlin, Naples,and Moscow, the actors, even the soundtrack and camerawork---to serve the movie's overarching objective.<br /><br />A good example---one of my favorites in \\"Supremacy\\"---is Bourne's brutal melee with former Treadstone spook Jarda (Martin Csokas): no soundtrack, totally edgy, very raw, two trained killers beating each other to death (one handcuffed!) with whatever means are available.<br /><br />The camerawork moves with the two fighters---not stagey at all, this is not a Bond fight---but the more organic perspective serves to bring you into this duel to the death.<br /><br />Another thing I respect about \\"Supremacy\\": the absolute lack of lard on this bad boy. In this era of cinematic bloat, the crucial job of editing---what to cut, what to leave in, and how to cut scenes to maximize dramatic effect---isn't always appreciated.<br /><br />\\"Supremacy\\" succeeds because it has no body-fat: every scene must tell, which makes you care about Jason Bourne all the more. Congrats to Christopher Rouse (from \\"Identity\\") and Richard Pearson for editing \\"Supremacy\\" so tight you could practically hear the film scream.<br /><br />Those who grooved on the helter-skelter chase sequences of \\"Identity\\" will relish Greengrass's serving up more of the same---only Greengrass ups the ante, both in terms of the pursuit, but also in terms of the fiendish inventiveness---and deadliness---of Jason Bourne himself, the Pursued. The chase through nocturnal Berlin is one of the craziest things I've ever seen on screen, and a true nail-biter.<br /><br />All the acting is note-perfect: Damon is tightly focused---but torn---Angel of Death, Karl Urban (Kirill) shines as his furiously efficient nemesis, Brian Cox looks fatter and more anxious as CIA spook Ward Abbott, and Joan Allen is all business as the new CIA Deputy Director.<br /><br />Taut, gripping, brutally paced, \\"Bourne Supremacy\\" is as merciless as a drive-by shooting and as cool as the metal on a silencer at 3 AM on a Siberian morning.

B00003CXA2|5.0|And this is definitely a good movie, probably the best movie of the 1990's.  Only just watched in full on TV on Friday and wow, best movie i have ever seen. This has to be the best role Hanks ever played and Zemeckis' greatist film.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I saw Gavin Degraw for the first time ever at an Avril concert. His songs were not hard to listen to unlike that crazy guy who had opened up for Avril I was praying that guy would stop singing but then Gavin came on the stage next and it was wonderful. The combination of piano, guaiar and drums was astonishing. I did not know any of the words yet, I was totally captive by his voice and music. I just bought his 2 for one CD that has all of his songs it is awesome. He reminds me of Billy Joel mixed with Ray Charles he is awesome and I can't wait to hear his next creation.
0451167716|5.0|My lady friends think that I am strange for reading, watching, and admiring the Godfather by Mario Puzo. Honestly, I believe it is one of the greatest novels of all times: it's very engaging and I find it very difficult to put the book down once I start reading it until I am forced to fall into asleep or arrive at work. <br /> I find it catchy too, I have been using the phrases \\"go to the Matresses\\", \\"sleeping with the Fishes\\", and \\"I'll reason with him\\" since I was 18 years old.  <br />Each character has a vivid personality that you feel that you know personally,like Michael, Sony, and Tom. The portrayal of the family life is very nostalgic and I think that all people must read it, especially you ladies, it is not a man novel, it is very intelligent and it makes you think!! do these things really happen and we do not know???!!Enjoy
B0006L16N8|5.0|With this release it is now certain that Coldplay will have a permenant place on the landscape of popular music. \\"X&Y\\" is as strong as their first two albums and in many cases their strongest release to date. This album will most liekly end up in my top ten favorites of 2005.  <br /> <br />This album seems to have a strong U2 influence. The driving guitars and intense musical arrangements are outstanding. Coldplay definitely scored with this release. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks so far are \\"Fix You\\", \\"Speed Of Sound\\", \\"Low\\" and my favorite \\"White Shadows\\".
B00023B1LC|5.0|Have you ever seen a movie that was so astoundingly cool, so effortless, so neatly, wonderfully hip, that you wondered why other movie studios didn't somehow find a way to copy its ingredients and bottle it up, maybe weaponize it, releasing into the atmosphere every time they needed a blockbuster?<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is that kind of movie.<br /><br />Director Doug Liman has taken all of the hyperkinetic and insanely cool techniques he used in the stylish \\"Go\\", and translated it over to the espionage genre, playing with the story of Robert Ludlum's best-selling \\"The Bourne Identity\\" to create a lightning-paced, sleek, intelligent and absorbing little spy-hunt that manages to out-Bond Bond himself and parallels (and nearly surpasses)Sydney Pollack's white-knuckled thriller \\"Three Days of the Condor.\\"<br /><br />In many ways, the story in \\"Bourne\\" is very close to \\"Condor\\": a confused protagonist and his reluctant companion find themselves pursued by a relentless, mysterious and deadly foe. When we first meet up with the movie's nameless protagonist (played masterfully by Matt Damon, who is becoming one of those actor who can charm the camera merely by sleeping---which, in fact, he does in this film)he is clad in a wetsuit, drifing unconscious in the ocean.<br /><br />He is picked up by a Portuguese fishing trawler and discovers he was 60 miles off the coast of Marseilles in the Mediterranean, but how he came there is a mystery. Indeed, everything is a mystery to our hero, for he has amnesia: he can't even remember his own name.<br /><br />He does remember a lot of other things, though: he discovers he can speak German, French, Italian, and Portuguese fluently; he can disarm and subdue two policemen in seconds; he knows how to drive a Mini Cooper *very* offensively; and he's a natural at staking out the opposition. Oh, and he has a laserlight pointer embedded in his hip, with the address of a Zurich bank and a numbered Swiss bank account.<br /><br />A trip to Zurich raises more questions than answers though, as Damon finds a bank-box with a slew of fake passports (one of which has the name \\"Jason Bourne\\", his picture, and his 'residence' in Paris), a bundle of money in different denominations, and a gun. Worse still, he has now raised the attention of the police, and is now pursued by them and a series of well-trained and motivated killers who want Bourne dead.<br /><br />To say anything more would spoil the fun of \\"Bourne\\", but it is rousingly well paced and intelligently directed. In a sense, \\"Bourne\\" is more Bondian than the Bond films, which are slick productions but often try too hard. \\"Bourne\\" also boasts excellent acting all around: Damon is great as a man literally searching for his identity while struggling for his very survival, Brian Cox racks up his third great character performance in a year (including his role as General Stryker in \\"X-Men 2\\" and his performance in \\"The Ring\\"), and Chris Cooper is excellent as a CIA spook.<br /><br />And then there is Franka Potente, one of the most beautiful women in film today, who was the white hot core of the eclectic \\"Run Lola Run.\\" Potente, who plays a gypsy who helps Bourne, works perfectly with Damon, and the two have great chemistry together. Potente can say more with a quirk of her mouth and a single look than most actresses can with 5 pages of script.<br /><br />The movie has everything you would want from a spy film: good villains, thrilling fight sequences, and a ripping chase through the streets of Paris in a vintage, beat up Mini Cooper. But best of all is Liman's ability to create a very real sense of menace and danger that is ratcheted up with every passing minute. Liman is very good at crafting this mounting atmosphere of peril, and shares much in common with Ridley Scott, particularly a solid feel for juicing up the danger-factor of otherwise innocnet locales.<br /><br />Spymaster John Le Carre once wrote a book called \\"The Perfect Spy\\". In praise of Doug Liman, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is The Perfect Spy Movie.<br /><br />JSGe Perfect Spy\\".

B000AADYRQ|4.0|Something is going on here.  You can hear it in the dorm rooms you pass, you can pick up hints of it on the radio, and it's spreading.  It come to your ears under the guise of strange titles like \\"Iron & Wine,\\" \\"The Shins,\\" \\"Belle and Sebastian,\\" and \\"Modest Mouse.\\" The entire scene is growing quicker than Sam Bean's beard, but the icon of the indie world is undoubtedly Death Cab For Cutie.  They've been around since 1997, but it wasn't until superfluous name-dropping on The OC that they were launched into the CD players of hundreds of thousands.  But so what if it took a teen-soap to get them there, one listen to a Death Cab album will assure anyone that they deserve the prominence they've ascended to.  Their much-awaited new album Plans was released August 30th and was met with midnight sales, a definitive sign of the popularity the quartet has obtained. <br /> Plans is Death Cab's latest album since their breakthrough Transatlantiscism released in 2003.  But Plans by no means capitalizes off the success of Transatlantiscism, it's completely different and a fresh album, but it stays faithful to Death Cab's unique style.  That style -- the meshing of cold, hollow piano, powerful, yet distant drums, airy guitar, combined with the comforting and confident signing of Ben Gibbard is maintained on Plans, and the album proves a beautiful addition to their distinguished discography.    <br /> Plans is mainly an album about being lost.  Being stuck in situations where you don't know where to go next.  But Gibbard's voice guides the listener to the next step in their life.  In many of the songs Gibbard affirms that he will be there for the \\"you\\" the song is directed to.  For instance in the song \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" with eternal lyrics that sound remniscent of The Postal Service (A Gibbard side-project) song, he says, \\"If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied and illuminate the `No' on their vacancy sign, [...] then I will follow you into the dark.\\"  This song of love enduring anything proves to be one of the best on the album.  The affirmation of love in spite of worry continues in \\"Someday You'll Be Loved.\\"  In it Gibbard sings that \\"I know your heart belongs to someone you have yet to meet, someday you will be loved.\\"  The album isn't as accessible as Transatlantiscism was, Transatlantiscism exploded into action from the start, and kept it up the whole album.  But Plans takes a more subtle route, infact the only song that seems like it will be an concert anthem is the invigoratingly catchy \\"Soul Meets Body\\" and \\"Crooked Teeth.\\" The album takes a darker turn than is usual for Death Cab on the song \\"What Sarah Said.\\"  With a piano progression extremely resonant of Something Corporate's love epic \\"Konstantine\\" Gibbard details the experience of going to the hospital to be at the side of friend who has gone critical and is going to - and does --- die.  After a few listens, it will send chills down the spine, with Gibbard almost unsympathetic voice chronicling the event, which goes into the theme of being lost, because he doesn't know how to feel in the situation and begs for \\".  This song leads into another eerie yet beautiful (a tone which Death Cab are masters of conveying) song, \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed.\\"  It depicts understanding of the inevitable decay of a relationship, because \\"I'm not who I used to be.\\"   <br /> Whereas Transatlanticism is a rock-out in the CD player album, Plans will open up more, and is better suited for listening like that of solemn late night stroll equiped with headphones and your Discman or I-Pod.  Plans may not be a good introduction for a newcomer to Death Cab, it would be better to check out some of their older works first, and while it's not their best album, it is an excellent one.  For those familiar with Death Cab or The Postal Service, it stands as a solace, and is fitting for anyone who's ever wondered about their lives, \\"Now what do I do?\\" -- which is to say everyone.
0385720920|1.0|...so don't waste your time reading this.  I see Palahniuk's point in this book, but his execution is forced and at times boring. His writing style tries to come off as cute or witty, but his attempt at sidebar Vonnegut tangents fails miserably.  This was my first book I read by him, and it really turned me off to his other works.
B000002JS6|5.0|With Brian.  Before starting the disc, make sure the audio is up to \\"11\\", and then GO. This disc is made for volume. Also, don't try and analyse the song like you are doing a paper for a Depth psychology course at Uncle Bob's  University. Just Play it!!  Brian's voice is a little less AC/DC in this disc... he hits his prime scream in some later albums.  I saw AC/DC once in 2002 so far, at the ROD LAVER  Arena ,and the group was pitch perfect. The house lights went totally out, and they launched into Back in Black, and you know under those circumstances that this group is not about thinking. When Brian Got to HELLS  BELLS, even in the trashy ROD LAVER  venue, he showed just what he could still do.  I have not, as at this date, got the dual disc of this album, but this disc remastered is superb, and plays  brilliantly on a 5.1  system. If the DUAL Disc has a proper THX or Surround  sound mix, then it should be absolutely  over the moon !!!!  ROCK ON !!!!!!
B000059Z8M|5.0|This movie is funny from start to finish. My grandaughter and I like Woody and Buzz.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's Meteora is the coolest thing in the world! With a sick blend of hip-hop, heavy metal, and electronica this is definately the best Linkin Park c.d. I recommend this to anyone that likes good music. NOT COUNTRY. If you like anything but country buy this c.d. now!
B000AADYYO|4.0|I don't want to repeat what others have said but there's a few things about this album that need mentioning.  <br /> <br />Martin Mendez' bass is much better here than on previous releases. I prefer the old bassist Johan Defarfalla, I think Mendez has been the weak link in Opeth, but he's improved on Ghost Reveries. <br /> <br />The transitions between the heavy and soft parts are more subtle and blended which may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. The soft parts are less organic than on previous releases. Whereas it used to be just an acoustic guitar, now the soft parts sound more like the Damnation songs, they are very 'prog' sounding, ie mellotrons and the like. Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals are outstanding as always but I don't think the melodies are as good as their previous work. There's no truly memorable clean vocals like in \\"Drapery Falls' or 'Benighted' or 'A Fair Judgement'.  <br /> <br />There's an absence of 'classic' Opeth riffs, those massively epic symphonic movements that just seem to soar. The end of Ghost of Perdition has the best one. <br /> <br />Ultimately, we all know everything Opeth touches is going to be brilliant. But I just feel that this album is a bit predictable, lacking those truly inspirational moments that send shivers down the spine. Atonement and Beneath the Mire, for exanple, show that Opeth have become slightly formulaic. But I'm probably being too harsh, I've been spoilt by their brilliance for so long I expect too much.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|This album is a huge disappointment.  Why would a band with such amazing talent choose not to use any of it?  I have been a huge DT fan since \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" first came out.  The \\"Falling into Infinity Album\\" had been the only bad thing they produced, until now.  I threw that album out, and I will be doing the same with this one. <br />I guess this is the chance people take when they love an innovative band.  I hope they get their heads screwed on straight before their next endeavor.  I might have given this two stars if I wasn't so disappointed.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|I really enjoy Jesse Cook. It is not pure genre, but I like the eclectic feel.
B00004Z459|5.0|If you don't have this c.d. buy it right now. Chester Benninton's loud vocals and Mike's crazy fast paced vocals will keep you listening forever! If you are a heavy metal fan but found that their songs on the radio are a bit too light for you buy the c.d. because crawling and in the end are about the only songs witout heavy metal riffs. buy buy buy.
0440241413|3.0|I read all the amazing reviews of this book and decided to try it out.  I was not impressed.  The writing was good for a fluffy chick lit book, but the main character was totally ridiculous.  If I knew Becky Bloomwood, I'm certain I would hate her.  Her idiotic thought processes are totally unbelievable and unrealistic.  I was much more able to relate to and laugh with Bridget Jones.  With this book I kept finding myself exasperated, wishing this girl would just get a clue.  I enjoy reading chick lit books as well as real literature, and I think I have appropriate expectations going into each book, depending on the genre (meaning I wasn't expecting this to be Jane Eyre or anything).  This one just didn't measure up to me.  It's a fun little beach read, but I was not bowled over.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Thi is the best of George Harrison brought back to life, a new life breathed into his masterpieces bu Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney and other geniuses and all his friends  It is AWESOME!  If your love George you will doubly love this.  And I'm sure Goerge is smiling at the justice which has been done by this group.  I Highly recommend this...heartbreacking as it is.  It is a MUST HAVE.
B000002IOY|5.0|Overkill always has awesome lyrics.Trust me, if you like metal(speed metal) you will like this album. <br />Time To Kill(awesome song),Elimination is my favorite song on the album,it just rules,here is the lyrics to the second chorus, <br />Eliminate the right <br />Eliminate the wrong <br />Eliminate the weak <br />Eliminate the strong <br />Eliminate your feelings <br />Eliminate too late <br />Eliminate the hope <br />Eliminate,Eliminate. <br />I Hate, unbelievalbe song, here are the lyrics to the chorus, <br />I hate people that make ya feel small <br />I hate havin' my back against the wall <br />I hate bein' talked down to <br />I hate your rules <br />I hate 'em all <br />Hate bein' marked to take the fall <br />Planet's not big enough for me and you.

B00097DX3U|5.0|this cd is a thousand times better than the first one-and i love the first one.this cds deeper both lyrically and musically.it has the wonderful,almost crooning lyrics of chris cornell and the wild guiter of tom morello.standout tracks:Out of Exile[my favorite],Doesn't Remind Me,Man or Animal[my other favorite],The Worm. <br />1.Your Time Has Come-cool lyrics and the opening guitar riff rocks.5/5 <br />2.Out of Exile-one of my two favorites.interesting lyrics,and again,cool guitar.5/5 <br />3.Be Yourself-nice single,though others are better.4/5 <br />4.Doesn't Remind Me-another favorite,cool lyrics.great choice for a single.5/5 <br />5.Drown Me Slowly-nice typical hard rock song.5/5 <br />6.Heaven's Dead-great slightly slower song-but still hard rock.5/5 <br />7.The Worm-this songs awesome,great vocals.5/5 <br />8.Man or Animal-my other favorite.i just love this song.great drums and guitar both really stand out.5/5 <br />the rest of the songs are pretty good too.i havent listened to them much yet to tell the truth :) this cds pretty cool.audioslave has turned into one of my favorite hard rock bands.i got this cd as a birthday present,but its definately worth buying.
B00005JMYI|3.0|It occured to me after watching this film that Will Farrell is probably a great comedian because he says SO much that some of it is bound to be funny.  It is then up to his directors and editors to trim out what doesn't work and leave in the good parts.  For the most part, they succeed in Anchorman - the Legend of Ron Burgandy.  Both Farrell and his male castmates embody their stereotypical parts.  The actors bring enough new life to the stereotypes that we immediately recognise the characters, while still being able to surprise and entertain (rather than bore) us.  Christina Applegate has the unenviable task of being the \\"straight man,\\" but pulls it off and even gets some great comedic moments herself.  She is, I think, the key to making the film work - a central realism around which the waves of absurdity crash - much like Graham Chapman in the Monty Python movies. <br /> <br />No, I don't mean to say that Anchorman is a ground-breaking or paradigm-shifting film - it is not Monty Python, Airplane, or There's Something About Mary.  At best, it's a minor comedy, but there are more laughs in it than in the entire Adam Sandler catalogue.  Or, for that matter, in all of Will Ferrell's SNL skits (the Jeopardy parodies excepted, of course).  The story: The four stooges of Channel 4's news team - the top 6-o'clock news show in San Diego! - are threatened when the station manager chooses to hire a woman reporter.  Instead of the expected story arc - they try to make her life intolerable but she eventually wins them over with her pluck - we get a weird conglomeration (and, oddly, more realistic) of macho chest-thumping and competition over who can bed her.  It is not until she has the audacity to fill in for Ron as anchor when he is unavoidably detained by a littering incident that the animosity breaks out into full-scale gender war. <br /> <br />For someone to appreciate the film from a review like this normally requires quoting jokes.  The great thing about the jokes in this film is that the funniest ones are not one-liners appropriate for TV spots.  Instead, they are longer, situation-driven banter that builds.  When the film strays from this pattern into going for the cheap laugh (and, I suspect, ad libs), the film slows into inanity (like some of Farrell's other pictures e.g. Old School). <br /> <br />The director's comentary included on this \\"unrated\\" DVD version seems to confirm the point.  Because it is unrated, commentators Farrell and director McKay think it would be funny to see who can come up with the most offensive words to say to see if they get beeped.  That in itself might be a little funny or at least educational if there was some buildup.  Instead they go on for 10 minutes in a game of 1-upmanship that is not funny because they are, in fact, beeped, and because it goes on and on (and on and on..... you get the idea).  The other special features are more enjoyable, including some out-takes (but not too many of the type where the actors start laughing, thank goodness) and a long list of deleted and/or alternate scenes.  There are some interesting choices in there, and a discussion on why certain performances were used instead of others would have made an interesting DVD commentary.  Too bad we get the swear factory instead.
B000006TRV|5.0|Okay, we get it, you don't like the album. There's no need to post such endless amounts of incoherent babble attempting to state as much. Your words are, to term a phrase you used to describe this amazing album: \\"the sickening results of egocentrism.\\" Seriously. If you really are a kid, go out and play and stop spending so much time on the internet trying to annoy people. Go bug classmates at your nursery school, or better yet, grow up and get a life. Thank you.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|By pure coincidence I received this DVD at the same time as ALICE IN CHAINS \\"Dirt\\" CD, and since I already knew Metropolis is a silent film, I naturally reviewed both items simultaneously, with startling results.  As our hero is being attacked by the mob, we hear \\"They've Come to Snuff the Rooster\\"<br /><br />and the lyrics fit the scene so well.  The somewhat gloomy sound of A.I.C. works quite well with the mood of the movie.  I intend to try other CDs but this one works so well, I must recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Wizard of Floyd.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|November 1984 saw the release of Madonna's \\"Like A Virgin\\" album, the Queen Of Pop's second studio album. The set definately made Madonna a household name. Produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the opus churned out four top five American singles. The first of the lot was the title track. \\"Like A Virgin\\" spent a rather lengthy 6 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Material Girl\\" followed, and charted at #2. The other 2 singles were \\"Angel\\" and \\"Dress You Up\\", which both charted at #5. The album remains her biggest selling studio set in the US, selling 10 million since its release, earning itself a diamond award. Despite being her biggest selling studio set in the US, worldwide \\"Virgin\\" has sold 20 million, only to be beaten by \\"True Blue\\", Madonna's third album. \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" has also sold more than \\"Virgin\\" worldwide, and in the US, but it is not a studio album. \\"Virgin\\" spent 3 weeks atop the Billboard Top 200, and travelled over the tally for over 2 year.    1. \\"Material Girl\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Angel\\" (9/10)  3. \\"Like A Virgin\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Over And Over\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Dress You Up\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Shoo-Be-Doo\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Pretender\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Stay\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Like A Virgin\\" [Extended Dance Mix] (10/10)  11. \\"Material Girl\\" [Extended Dance Mix] (10/10)    \\"Material Girl\\" starts off the album brilliantly. What more do I need to say??? \\"Angel\\" is probably \\"Virgin's\\" weakest moment. Madonna vocals are strong, but lyrically, I don't think it's as good as the other tracks. \\"Like A Virgin\\" is definately one of the album's best moments, and one of Madonna's best efforts of the 80's. \\"Over And Over\\" is brilliant also, whereas \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" is definately, in my personal opinion, one of Madonna's best ballads, along with some of her later efforts. \\"Dress You Up\\" is definately my favourite track on the album. I love how Madonna combines fashion and love in one song. \\"Shoo-Be-Doo\\" is another great effort that is one of the best. \\"Pretender\\" is a really great track, and I don't know why many people say it is filler. \\"Stay\\" is definately one of the best tracks. The bonus remixes are also brilliant, especially the \\"Like A Virgin\\" one. Recommended!    My top three \\"Like A Virgin\\" pics:-  3) Stay  2) Like A Virgin  1) Dress You Up
B000002H33|5.0|This album is one of the best metal albums of all time. Many people might be turned off by the long song structures, but I have always enjoyed long songs. I think the lyrics are intelligent and the vocals, guitars and drums all have power. It is a shame Metallica will never reach this level of greatness ever again, but this album will spin in CD players for a long time coming. Don't think because this album is 19 years old that it is completely outdated. This is when music was the first priority. Today's music is nothing more than selling a superficial image and making selfish and acceptance-craving teens feel important. There is no meaning or quality in today's music. This album has withstood the test of time and will still be listened to religiously long after all your fake heroes are long forgotten... and they WILL be forgotten, because many of today's teenagers do not have a long enough attention span to continue listening to what is cool now. When I continue listening to this album, many of you will be hopelessly and mindlessly devoted to the next big thing.   <br /> <br />         I do not expect everyone to like this album as much as I do. If others do not like it, that is fine, BUT, the negative reviews I keep seeing really crack me up because first of all, most of them cannot even give an intelligent or coherent reason as to why they do not like it. Secondly, most of the people bashing this album are nothing more than trendies who only hate it because all the preppies at school do not like it. Since you idiots with no minds of your own want to be \\"cool\\" you have to listen to the same music they do. You have to wear the same baggy clothes they do. All of you trendy little \\"follow the leader\\" mindless drones first need to grow up and then if it is not too much trouble, get a mind of your own. If you are all going to share a brain why don't you get one that works? <br /> <br /> One reviewer who calls the album crap calls himself a genius but yet isn't smart enough to be able to spell simple 3-letter words? You are not a genius. You are a moron!  Another reviewer refers to the negative reviewers as intelligent but yet he himself cannot spell intelligent right! Where do you people come from? Another reviewer accuses Metallica fans of being a cult. That is very hypocritical considering the MTV and TRL fans stick together tighter than a virgin on her wedding night!  Another review claims that Metallica sucks and Dave Mustaine rules. If that is true, then explain to me why after all these years Dave Mustaine still regrets being thrown out of Metallica? Another reviewer claims that only Nu-metal is awesome. Do you want to know the real reason Nu-metal was created? It was created for little boys who want to make people think they are tough and macho by listening to music that is heavier than pop rock, but these sissies cannot handle heavy metal. Hence, Nu-metal was born. Linkin Park is NOT metal. They are New Kids on the Block with musical instruments. Their songs about love prove that. Another reviewer calls Metallica's lyrics girlish. Songs about drug addiction, mental disease, war, false salvation, etc. are girlish? Give me a break! Grunge is dead. It died the day Cobain the coward killed himself. Master of Puppets is boring newbie metal? Metallica has been around for 24 years. Where does the newbie part come in?  <br /> <br />  I also read the reviews of another negative reviewer who calls himself MTV Rocks. He calls himself an individual, but yet in the same breath will only listen to music on MTV or TRL. Only a loser kid who will do anything to fit in with the cool crowd is brainwashed and narrow-minded to think that the only quality music is only on MTV and TRL. The musicians on these stations do not care about the quality of their music. They are superficial shallow people without originality or musical talent. They want you to identify with their looks and image because if you really took the time to analyzethe music, you would realize it is self-indulgent music will no worthy message. MTV Rocks, just because they have not heard of something does not mean it must suck. For all the bands that are considered pioneers and yet you have never heard of them, the only way that you could have possibly never heard of them is because you must not be any older than 10 years old. That means you have never lived in the real world and you do not know anything, hence your opinion means nothing. Once you grow up and learn to think for yourself, maybe the rest of us will begin to take your friends' opinions.... I mean your opinions seriously! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer claims Master of Puppets is a homosexual's dream. Why do insecure little macho men think that it is the ultimate insult to call other men gay? You should know by now that people who are homophobic are really closeted homosexuals who are too ashamed to admit they are gay. Another reviewer claimed that Load, Reload and St. Anger are their best albums and the first 5 are crap. Yeah whatever! Of course, he cannot back it up. Metallica is suicide music? The kids at Columbine killed because of this kind of music? First of all, not all killers listen to heavy metal. When Cain killed his brother Able I am sure he did not listen to Slayer before he did it. Secondly, heavy metal does not create killers. Otherwise, MILLIONS of metalheads would have tortured and killed all you winy little boys 20 years ago! Besides, regardless of what kind of music you listen to, if you are willing to kill someone for whatever reason, you were screwed in the head in the first place! Blaming music for murder, rape and suicide is just a cop-out excuse so these pathetic excuses for human beings can avoid being responsible for their immoral actions. Take responsibility and accept the consequences of your actions. That is what it's like to be an adult!  <br /> <br />I am also sick and tired of people bashing Metallica just because they went against Napster claiming \\"they are just greedy and do not want to part with their 7 digit salary!\\" That is pretty stupid and hypocritical considering you are downloading songs for free and too tight to part with 2 digits! That is right! You will not part with $12-15 for a CD but Metallica are greedy because they do not want to part with millions of dollars?! You won't buy a single CD but you will dump hundreds of dollars a week on smoking dope so you can kill the 3 remaining brain cells in your head! Being high is extremely limited. Listening to a CD you thoroughly enjoy lasts for years to come. It's a much better rush! Besides, you smoke dope the same reason you listen to trendy music, to fit in with the cool crowd. Blink 182 and Sum41 are NOT PUNK! They are pop rock marketed as punk. True punk has always been about rebelling against society and the system. Being MTV's little crack whores goes against EVERYTHING true punk stands for. Korn is not real metal. Why do you think they are called Nu-metal? Nu-metal is a generic and second-rate form of metal. Metallica was around long before Korn was and will still be around long after Korn is dead and gone. That goes for all this Nu-metal substandard music.  <br />
0385510438|5.0|John Grisham spins great tales from the South.  I grew up in Hernando Mississippi.  John's books are believable because the details behind the stories are REAL.  I remember sitting on the same lawn that John writes in his book waiting for local election results.  I remember the team of lawyers that seemed to drink to much and broke down every nugget of gossip in the town.   <br /> <br />The story is entirely believable and a great absorption into the ways of the South during the late 60's and 70's.  I think it is one of his best works yet.
1857993284|4.0|This book would make a poor story if it were just a story but it is more importantly a book intended to teach people about philosophy.  I give this book credit for trying to entertain people while teaching them about philosophy.  That is really what some people need in order to more easily grasp the information.  I personally thought the story was rather mild but the I learned half of what I know about philosophy from this book so its worth buying for that.  What this book succeeds in doing is giving you a problem in philosophy then giving you the solutions people have come up with and the reasoning behind those answers.  this in my opinion is the best way to learn about philosophy.
B000002LLC|5.0|Madonna's companion album to the film \\"Dick Tracy\\" wasn't your standard soundtrack. While it included three songs that were featured in the hit film (\\"Sooner Or Later,\\" \\"More\\" and \\"What Can You Lose\\") the bulk of the material was inspired by the movie. The set's first single, \\"Vogue\\" (originally slated to be the b-side of \\"Keep It Together\\"), was an international #1 hit. It was followed by the cheeky \\"Hanky Panky,\\" a #10 U.S. hit and a #2 single in the UK. \\"Vogue\\" earned a whopping nine MTV Video Music Award nominations in 1990, out of which it won three. The \\"I'm Breathless\\" soundtrack (what can be also classed as Madonna's sixth album) reached #2 in the US. <br /> <br />1. \\"He's A Man\\" (10/10) <br />2. \\"Sooner Or Later\\" (10/10) <br />3. \\"Hanky Panky\\" (10/10) <br />4. \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" (9/10) <br />5. \\"Cry Baby\\" (9/10) <br />6. \\"Something To Remember\\" (10/10) <br />7. \\"Back In Business\\" (10/10) <br />8. \\"More\\" (9/10) <br />9. \\"What Can You Loose\\" (9/10) <br />10. \\"Now I'm Following You Part 1\\" (10/10) <br />11. \\"Now I'm Following You Part 2\\" (10/10) <br />12. \\"Vogue\\" (10/10) <br /> <br />\\"I'm Breathless\\" is not one of Madonna's best albums at all, yet it's still excellent, and deserves a place in any Madonna fan's collection. \\"He's A Man\\" is definately one of the album's best tracks, as is \\"Sooner Or Later\\". The hit \\"Hanky Panky\\" spices things up a bit, whereas the song \\"I'm Going Bananas\\" is too short! It's also a bit silly, but still good overall. \\"Cry Baby\\" improves slightly from \\"Bananas\\", but the lyrics are still a bit silly. \\"Something To Remember\\" is a beautiful ballad, whereas \\"Back In Business\\" is also really, really great. \\"More\\" and \\"What Can You Loose\\" are good, but not as good as some of the other tracks. Both \\"Now I'm Following You\\" parts are really good, Part 2 being more up-tempo than the first. \\"Vogue\\" closes the album brilliantly as the best song. I recommend this album if you are a die-hard Madonna fan. <br /> <br />My top three \\"I'm Breathless\\" pics:- <br />3) Something To Remember <br />2) Hanky Panky <br />1) Vogue
B00005JNTX|5.0|Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" was one of the best comic books ever written. It has these awesome ensemble characters. Each was so interesting and each had their flaws and all of them seemed human. Even though it's obvious that the film version and the graphic novels of \\"Sin City\\" take place in a world that is far away from here.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is one of the greatest directors of our time - he stands by Tarantino, Spielberg, Craven & others as collaberator of some of the greatest films that we've been pleased enough to see. He made amazing movies such as \\"From Dusk 'Till Dawn\\", \\"Desperadoes\\", 2003's beautiful and bloody epic, \\"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\\", he also makes kid's films that are actually fun to see. He made the \\"Spy Kids\\" trilogy and he just finished the new 3-D picture, \\"Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl\\". But his true jems are films like this.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is filmed in a very interesting way. It's Black & White, but various objects (eyes, blood, outfits, etc.) are in color, which makes \\"Sin City\\" a breathtaking pulpy noir film. If the movie was fully in color, it would still be fun, but it wouldn't look as good as it does. It's three of the graphic novels in one 2-hour film.<br /><br />The first story begins the film and ends it. John Hartigan (Bruce Willis in his best work since \\"Die Hard\\") plays a cop who is retiring at 60 because of heart condition. He still has one loose end to tie up. He is trying to save an 11-year-old girl named Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba as the 20-year old version. This movie is worth watching just for her, she's SO HOT!) is in the hands of a drooling child molester. And now since Hartigan is off the force and he's free to do whatever the hell he wants, he saves Nancy but is nearly beaten to death. He was framed and he is spending 8 years in prison. And when he gets out, the first thing he does is try to save a now 20-year old Nancy from a yellow rapist who can only give in if his victims scream. And Hartigan is once again out to save Nancy's back.<br /><br />The 2nd story revolves around the character of Mickey Rourke. He plays Marv - a guy who is in love with a prostitute named Goldie. When he is sleeping, a cannibal (Elijah Wood in a thoroughly disturbing role). It's his job to save himself and Goldie's twin sister Wendy (both ladies played by Nicole Kidman lookalike Jamie King). The bloody results are anything but pretty.<br /><br />The last story revolves around Dwight (a very good Clive Owen) is trying to save everybody from a dirty cop with a penchant for violence (Benecio DelToro in a very enthusiastic part), he plays the ultimate bad guy and he gets his comeuppance. Dwight tries to save the girls of \\"Old Town\\"( a city that is overrun by [...]). He takes place in a bloody war that includes Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel and other recognizable people.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Sin City\\" is easily the coolest movie of the year and it provides great surprises and thrills the whole way through. You shouldn't buy this DVD though. Rent it a few times, because director Robert Rodriguez has something special planned for fans that plan to wait for what is yet to come. There will be a 2-disc special edition that will include new footage and much more. This DVD has only a lousy 8-minute behind-the-scenes featurette. I bought it for about $10 somewhere, but I will be the first one there when the Special Edition hits the shelves. Get SIN CITY immediately.save Nancy's back.

B00080ZG10|2.0|The movie does not have a deep focus whether it be Hughes as the Business Genius, Hughes as the Engineering Genius, or Hughes as the Deeply Troubled Man.  Instead it hip-hops from topic to topic hoping that special effects will keep us interested and mere vignettes are sufficient. DiCaprio is hopeless as an actor when he is is required to show Hughes' slide into a compulsive isolated world. In fact the screen play gives no assistance in developing our understanding or sympathy for Hughes.  <br /> <br />Hughes' story has all the makings of a great tradegy; the hero brought down by the tragic flaw of compulsion possibly aggravated by physical injury.  The only tragic element in this movie is that so much money and talent was wasted making it! <br /> <br />It is an indictment of the movie industry that this movie is considered Oscar winning quality.
B000000JO3|3.0|I own this, and I'm old enough to remember when it was new.  It is admirable based on attitude and passion, but at some point you do have to have the chops and song skills to put it across.  Minor Threat falls short most of the time on those counts.  The other trap of course is the preachiness that they fall into with the lyrics.  Preachy is preachy no matter what you are espousing.  The brilliant thing that many early punk bands did was mix in an occasional knowing wink, with the content and attitude.  Minor Threat is so unrelenting that it all becomes static to any but the most totally committed. <br /> <br />The reason I say the guy who called sum 41 true punk an inadvertent genius is because he baited many other reviewers into responding and demonstrating the overly self seriousness that a lot of hardcore suffered from.  Lighten up guys, then you might realize when you're being toyed with for the amusement of others.  Black Flag had it right with a mix of statement like \\"Rise Above\\", but also humor mixed in like \\"TV Party.\\" <br /> <br />
B00005J6T0|5.0|1986's \\"True Blue\\" was a mammoth worldwide success. The set reached #1 in the US and 27 other countries (at the time unprecedented for a female artist) and spawned 5 smash singles. The lead-off single, Live To Tell, hit #1 in the US and was followed by another 4 Top five tracks. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\" also got #1, whereas \\"True Blue\\" got #3, and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" got #4. The album cemented her chart domination in the UK, where \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"True Blue\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" all got #1, aswell as the album itself. Produced by Madonna, Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, the album garnered her second Grammy award nomination. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" scored a nod for Female Pop Vocal Performance. \\"True Blue\\" is Madonna's biggest selling studio album worldwide, with estimated sales at 23 million.    1. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Open Your Heart\\" (10/10)  3. \\"White Heat\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Live To Tell\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Where's The Party\\" (10/10)  6. \\"True Blue\\" (10/10)  7. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\" (9/10)  10. \\"True Blue\\" [The Color Mix] (10/10)  11. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" [Extended Mix] (10/10)    The album's opener track, \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", is a brilliant track that will always been a classic. \\"Open Your Heart\\" and \\"Live To Tell\\" are definately the best singles released from the album, whereas \\"White Heat\\" is dedicated to Jimmy Cagney. It's another great song. \\"Where's The Party\\" is also great, and I'm suprised this wasn't a single too! The singles \\"True Blue\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" are also absolutely brilliant, though the embarrassing girlie video for \\"True Blue\\" isn't that great! Note that the video does not appear on here. \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" is brilliant, and I honestly don't know why so many people hate it! \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\" is probably \\"Blue's\\" weakest moment, but it's still worth a listen. Once again, the remixes are great, the one for \\"La Isla Bonita\\" being slightly better. This is definately one of Madonna's best album's, and I strongly recommend it!    My top three \\"True Blue\\" pics:-  3) White Heat  2) Open Your Heart  1) Live To Tell
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Clapton is out of his melancholy mood here.  Nice backup musicians, too.  I enjoyed it the first time I listened to it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Who cares! This album is really amazing, the first time i listened All the things she said i was shocked by what i was hearing, a great song with an outrageous chorus. Not gonna Get us is very good too. Show me love is a song i can lsiten over and over again, i love the chorus. 30 Minutes is one of my favorites songs in this album, is a very dark sad but good ballad. They covered The Smiths' How soon is now? in an excellent way, i love The Smiths and this cover is great! Clowns(can you see me now) is gorgeous, i love the \\"floting forest in the air\\" phrase. Malchik Gay is very fun to listen to. Stars one of the best ballad songs ever made, i like the russian rap part of this song. Ya shosla s uma, nas ne diagonat are excellent and the extended remix is perfect! <br /> <br />if you haven't bought this album, go for it now. and also you should look for thier new album coming this october \\"dangerous and Moving\\" which first single \\"all about us\\" is the perfect come back song!
B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna's debut album released in 1983, produced by Reggie Lucas, features some stunning songs. It brought together some of her dance/club hits (\\"Everybody\\", \\"Physical Attraction\\", \\"Burning Up\\"), but also features the smash hit singles \\"Holiday\\", \\"Borderline\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\". The first smash out of the gate was \\"Everybody\\". It hit the Billboard's Disco Chart back in early 1982, before this album's release, and peaked at #3. The double-sided 12\\" \\"Burning Up/Physical Attraction\\" followed this release, and peaked at #3 also. After Madonna had bagged up 2 Top 3 hits on the Disco Chart, Madonna stormed into the Billboard Hot 100 to release \\"Holiday\\", which charted at #16, giving Madonna her first Top 40 hit. \\"Borderline\\" (#10) and \\"Lucky Star\\" (#4) followed. This album peaked at #8 on The Billboard Top 200, and spent a whopping 168 weeks on the chart. Madonna wrote 5 of the 8 tracks on this album, which has sold 5 million in the US since its release, 10 million worldwide.  <br /> <br />1. \\"Lucky Star\\" (10/10) <br />2. \\"Borderline\\" (10/10) <br />3. \\"Burning Up\\" (10/10) <br />4. \\"I Know It\\" (9/10) <br />5. \\"Holiday\\" (10/10) <br />6. \\"Think Of Me\\" (10/10) <br />7. \\"Physical Attraction\\" (10/10) <br />8. \\"Everybody\\" (10/10) <br />9. \\"Burning Up\\" [12\\" Version] (10/10) <br />10. \\"Lucky Star\\" ['New' Mix] (10/10) <br /> <br />Overall, this album is really one to own if you are a Madonna fan. No Madonna fan should be without her fantastic debut! \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Borderline\\" are really excellent tracks. They are brilliant singles and 2 of Madonna's best! \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"I Know It\\" aren't my favourite songs from the album, but they are still solid listens. \\"Holiday\\" is definately a Madonna classic, and one of the best songs on this album. \\"Think Of Me\\" is yet another excellent song, whereas \\"Physical Attraction\\" and \\"Everybody\\" are more brilliant listens. Every Madonna fan should hear these songs!! The 2 bonus remixes that appear on this album are also great, especially the remix of \\"Lucky Star\\". I completely recommend this album to die-hard Madonna fans! <br /> <br />My top three \\"Madonna\\" pics:- <br />3) Lucky Star <br />2) Holiday <br />1) Physical Attraction
0385513755|5.0|This is a unique book in the sense that the author uses a thrilling plot to put across his perspective on history. In the process you end up reading a lot of history that you would not otherwise care for. In a way this is similar to what Vishnu Sharma, the composer of Panchatantra did, though Panchatantra contains hundreds of interlocking tales, all designed to teach the readers a lesson.<br /><br />And that's what Dan Brown has done. He has used this book to tell people what many scholars have believed for a long time, that there are many things about the Catholic Church that we don't know. And some of these things are not so nice. That is perhaps the reason why the book irritates some readers.<br /><br />The plot is interesting, particularly if you haven't already read Angels and Demons, which is almost similar in structure and style. What is also interesting is the side-trips into art history and religious symbolism that the hero keeps making all the time. As I said, the plot is only the sugar-coating around the bitter pill, so expect a lot of these side trips.<br /><br />However, it must be remembered that interpretation of religious symbols is extremely controversial and is often affected by academic extermism. Therefore, such interpretation must not be treated as a valid comment on a faith, unless endorsed by the practitioners or scholars from within the faith itself. Some of the interpretations of religious sysmbols are downright idiotic and hilarious: for instance, he tells us that entrance to a church building actually symbolises entering a woman's genitals. Like many others, he also sees the sexual in the sacred almost everywhere - though he misses the obvious sexuality of his companion till the very end of the novel.<br /><br />This edition has most of the pictures of the places mentioned in the book, which makes it come more alive. However, as a result the book is much bigger and heavier, which makes it difficult to read in the bed or to carry it on a journey. My son insisted on buying the paperback also, because he found it too big to handle!<br /><br />Dan Brown's take on Church history has also spawned a bit of a storm and a backlash. Most people don't like their beliefs being questioned (though the Church often forgets this when it comes to dealing with other faiths). The book also contains many statements which are not really verifiable, and are probably an exercise in intellectual speculation. This has led to a string of denials, and has spawned a series of books which tell you whether Dan Brown's da Vinci Code is based on facts or on fiction.<br /><br />Ultimately then you should buy this book for its tale, and for the lesson that there may be many alternative truths.ing the paperback also, because he found it too big to handle!

B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna's fourth studio album, produced by herself and Patrick Leonard, hit #1 around the world upon its release in March 1989. The album's title track reached the top of the singles chart in both the US and UK and was followed by four more US hits: \\"Express Yourself\\" (#2), \\"Cherish\\" (#2), \\"Oh Father\\" (#20) and \\"Keep It Together\\" (#8). \\"Dear Jessie\\" was released in the UK and hit #5. The album's videos earned seven MTV Video Music Award nominations, including best video of the year (\\"Like A Prayer\\") and best female video (\\"Express Yourself\\"). She took home the Moon Man for Viewer's Choice for the title video. In 1990, the video for \\"Oh Father,\\" directed by David Fincher, won the Grammy for best short form music video. \\"Like A Prayer\\" has sold over 4 million units in the US, and another 11 million internationally.    1. \\"Like A Prayer\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Express Yourself\\" (10/10)  3. \\"Love Song\\" (9/10)  4. \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Promise To Try\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Cherish\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Dear Jessie\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Oh Father\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Keep It Together\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Spanish Eyes\\" (10/10)  11. \\"Act Of Contrition\\" (10/10)    Like A Prayer was my fav Madonna studio album, until Confessions On A Dance Floor got released. It's extremely personal and must have been depressing for Madonna to make this album, as she talks about the death of her mother, the love/hate relationship with her father, and her recent (at the time of the album's release) break-up with Sean Penn. All of the singles are brilliant, \\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Oh Father\\" being the best. \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Cherish\\", \\"Keep It Together\\" (US single only) and \\"Dear Jessie\\" (UK single only) are also brilliant. The album tracks must not be missed either. \\"Love Song\\", a duet with Prince, is definately the album's weakest moment, but definately a good song. \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\" and \\"Promise To Try\\" are probably the album's best unreleased tracks, because they are personal. It makes Madonna all the more better for it. \\"Spanish Eyes\\" is a latin effort, and it blows \\"La Isla Bonita\\" right out of the water, whereas \\"Act Of Contrition\\" is more like an interlude. It's \\"Like A Prayer\\" playing backwards and Madonna mumbling to herself, basically. Overall, this album is brilliant. You cannot call yourself a Madonna fan if you don't have this in your collection.     My top three \\"Like A Prayer\\" pics:-  3) Promise To Try  2) Oh Father  1) Like A Prayer
0140277447|5.0|Before I picked up this book in Hongkong, I had never heard of Nanking. It's a thin paperback, and I turned to the photographs, and their captions. The pictures were unbelievably horrible. Reading the book back in the hotel room at night, I was amazed and deeply disturbed. What makes perfectly decent people turn into such murderers? <br /> <br />The book tries to answer this question. I don't know enough about the Second World War in Asia or about the Japanese to form an opinion about her answers. Perhaps it is possible that brutalisation of soldiers at the hands of their superiors could have turned thme into senseless brutes, rapists, killing people for sport, and torturing them in various ways. <br /> <br />The book describes what happened in Nanking (China) when the Chinese army lost to the Japanese during the second world war. The defenders, when caught, were killed, their heads displayed on poles. Civilian prisoners were tortured, not treated much better than cockroaches. There were instances where officers held competitions to see who could chop off 100 heads first from amongst the prisoners (facsimile of Japanese newspaper report included). The prisoners were used for target practice. <br /> <br />Women suffered the most. It is probably impossible to describe the sense of helplessness that pervades these sections of the book, een though there are one or two stories of great heroism by women who lived through the ordeal. I must warn you that some of the images and the events can be very disturbing for ordinary people. <br /> <br />Chang writes very well. Her prose is dry, and she tries to remain neutral, which really requires an enormous effort, considering the events she describes. The result is like a documentary, and one that has the ring of authenticity. <br /> <br />One weakness of the book appears to be that it does not give the Japanese version of these events. This is of course true of World War 2 in general. Only one version of history comes to us through the English language press. One therefore needs to keep in mind that this book may not be giving you the full truth. <br /> <br />Reading through the book, one is reminded of a similar event which took place a long time ago: the rape and plunder of Delhi by Nadir Shah in the 1739. Another similar event took place in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in 1970's when Yahya Khan's troops butchered hundreds of thousands of Bengalis and took their women as sexual slaves. According to one story, when the Indian army reached these women kept in Pakistani bunkers, they found that the women had been denied all clothing -- to make sure that they don't commit suicide by strangling themselves!  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, we always try to forget these events. Almost nothing was written about the Bangladeshi genocide, so that people simply do not know. Whatever was written is not available outside Bangladesh. This is perhaps what would have happened to Nanking also, if Iris Chang had not written this bestseller. <br /> <br />Chang has done a marvellous job, though one wishes that she had not -- it would allow people to sleep much easier. However, we need to remind ourselves of the horror that we can commit in the name of the empire, so that perhaps history would not repeat itself. <br /> <br />One important change that the book may make to your perspective is that you may stop thinking of Japanese as the people who suffered Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You may start thinking of them as also people who perpetrated Nanking. Possibly this is one of the objectives of the book.
B000002LND|5.0|To this day, \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" remains Madonna's biggest selling album worldwide, with over 12 million sold in the US and another 14 million outside America. Spanning 1983 through 1990, the set collects 15 of Madonna's biggest singles, along with two new tracks: \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me.\\" In fact, Madonna had so many hits during the `80s, there simply was not enough room on the album for all of her big singles. Even top five singles like \\"Dress You Up\\" and \\"Who's That Girl\\" couldn't be squeezed onto the set. \\"Justify My Love,\\" a collaboration with Lenny Kravitz, hit #1 in the US and went top ten just about everywhere else. \\"Rescue Me\\" was the follow-up, and at the time became her highest-debuting US single, opening at #15 on The Billboard Hot 100. It would go on to peak at #9 in the US and achieve top ten rankings throughout the world. \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" spent two weeks at #2 in the US and nine weeks atop the UK charts - her longest run at #1 in that country.    1. \\"Holiday\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Lucky Star\\" (10/10)  3. \\"Borderline\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Like A Virgin\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Material Girl\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Crazy For You\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Into The Groove\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Live To Tell\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Open Your Heart\\" (10/10)  11. \\"La Isla Bonita\\" (10/10)  12. \\"Like A Prayer\\" (10/10)  13. \\"Express Yourself\\" (10/10)  14. \\"Cherish\\" (10/10)  15. \\"Vogue\\" (10/10)  16. \\"Justify My Love\\" (10/10)  17. \\"Rescue Me\\" (10/10)    \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" was my favourite Madonna studio album, and out of all of Madonna's compilation albums (\\"You Can Dance\\", \\"The Immaculate Collection\\", \\"Something To Remember\\", \\"GHV2: Greatest Hits Volume 2\\" and \\"Remixed And Revisited\\"), this is definately my fave. This is actually my favourite Madonna album out of studio and compilation albums! All of the tracks are just brilliant, and Madonna's 80's hits are probably the best songs of her career! Since I've rated most of these tracks, I'll give their American chart positions instead. \\"Holiday\\" (#16), \\"Lucky Star\\" (#4), \\"Borderline\\" (#10), \\"Like A Virgin\\" (#1), \\"Material Girl\\" (#2), \\"Crazy For You\\" (#1), \\"Into The Groove\\" wasn't a single in the US, but hit #1 in the UK, \\"Live To Tell\\" (#1), \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (#1), \\"Open Your Heart\\" (#1), \\"La Isla Bonita\\" (#4), \\"Like A Prayer\\" (#1), \\"Express Yourself\\" (#2), \\"Cherish\\" (#2), \\"Vogue\\" (#1), \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\" are mentioned above. 7 American #1's? And also 5 #1's in the UK? Immaculate? I think so.     My top three \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" pics:-  3) Justify My Love  2) Into The Groove  1) Like A Prayer

B00004Y6NU|5.0|Industrial disease here, telling you that this album is a great <br />and it is a masterpiece of 1982. All of these songs are all time <br />classics!! Why is Brothers in Arms so popular? This is way better <br />though. Anyway, Telegraph Road, Private Investigations, & Love <br />Over Gold are AMG picks on this album. Pick Withers does a great <br />job on drums on heavy rocking, It Never Rains. Industrial Disease <br />is a funny masterpiece and is got Doctor Parkinson in it too. <br />How come they never did a live version of the song Industrial <br />Disease? Listen, better together with Making Movies, & On The Night which are probably DS' best CDs of all time, ever!!  <br />Buy this. <br />

Walk of Life, Heavy Fuel, & Money for Nothing are AMG picks for this album which maybe the 3 best. <br />The ones that are also really the best, is Romeo and Juliet and <br />it is way better than the studio and is a song you must repeat. <br />Calling Elvis is a great way to open this concert. Private Investigations is even great because it's got even heavier metal <br />than studio. On Every Street, Your Latest Trick, & You and Your <br />Friend are my least favorites on the album and which I like the <br />studioes better. They are too slow for me though. Was This Review <br />Helpful To You? Get This.
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|<br /> If you can actually explain to me how this band's sound has grown or matured, rather than simply saying that it has, I'd be amazed.  Because the sad fact is this music is much more simple, and much less interesting.  They've shown no growth whatsoever, quite the opposite. So, I'm not really sure what makes most of these reviewers think this album is better or even as good as the first.  Take the first album; remove all the music but the guitar,bass, and drums; cut back the track lengths;  dumb down the melodies; and change the lyrics to the same vague emotional crap other bands like Staind have been doing for years; and then you'll have some idea what this new album sounds like.  It doesn't really sound like the Used though, which for some reason a lot of negative reviews have said.  It just sounds like really boring, generic rock music, the same kind you can find from a myriad of other bands.  This definitely does not have the somewhat unique sound of their first release.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is one of the very greatest Dire Straits albums ever, period! All the songs rock, Tunnel of Love, Skateaway, Romeo <br />and Juliet, & Solid Rock are all AMG picks on this album which <br />maybe my favourites on this album. Expresso Love, Hand in Hand, <br />& the very great, Les Boys are also great songs too. DOn't get <br />me wrong, Les Boys is not the worst DS song of all time, if you <br />say it is, I'll kick you!!!!!! How come the only song they play <br />from this album on the radio is Romeo? Why is it so popular? <br />The most popular songs from DS would be here which are great. <br />Sultans of Swing <br />Money for Nothing <br />Walk of Life <br />Romeo and Juliet <br />Brothers in Arms <br /> <br />Very good CD. Highly recommended.
B00000634J|5.0|One of the best cds i have bought in a long time. I would recommend this cd to anyone. An absolute must have in any cd collection.
B0007P3582|2.0|Ok so 50 cent titles his second album the massacre. I can understand taking shots at Fat Joe and Ja Rule but to go as far as to diss one of the greatest artists ever. Nas has layed down some of the best verses in history. Also he has made some of the most influencial rap songs ever with songs like \\"One Mic\\" and \\"I Can.\\" Lets face it 50 is not in his league and never will be..put some content in your songs for once. He said The Massacre would out sell Get Rich or Die Tryin..its not going to because he doesnt put out much quality material. In Da Club made his career and once everyone eventually forgets about that song 50 will eventually fade off. 2 stars because some of the collabos are decent.
0893860220|5.0|This is one of the best books about spirituality that I've ever read.I recommend it highly.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest albums made in the last few years and ranks close to the best albums ever. Its consistent throughout each song brings its own special thing to the cd. One of the greatest things about Kanye is that you can listen to each song over and over and never get bored. Every verse Kanye brings is solid. Songs like \\"Family Business\\" and \\"All Falls Down\\" bring something about Kanyes that other rappers in the game today cant bring. Almost Flawless.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|the quadrilogy is worth buying for the 1st 2 movies...james camerons directors cuts is just mind blowing...alien 3 is a complete let down and the fourth part is action...over all a good set but you could do with only the first 2 movies.
B00005AQE8|5.0|The greatest rap album ever by the greatest rap artists ever. Ranks up there with the bst in music history. R.I.P.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I've been listening this album the past few weeks without being able to stop. Just by looking at the name of the album (Funeral) you already think this has to be a good album. There is a little bit of everything here: Joy Division, Bauhaus, The Cure,...., and Interpol, Franz Ferdinand. The influences are old and new, and the result is simply excellent. This is a masterpiece that you can listen once and again without getting tired of it.  I would rate it with 6 stars if I could.
B0000024JN|5.0|I love the Beastie Boys and you can't go wrong with an oldie but goodie.
B0000TB050|5.0|This DVD is fantastic!  Even if you are not a huge U2 fan, the live performance and interaction with the audience is just great to see. They do many of the \\"old\\" favorites as well as some of their newer hits so there is a good variety.  This is a definite must have for all U2 fans.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I've never had an addiction to a CD, but this one hasn't left my player in over a year!!! His music is so original and you can tell that the lyrics came straight from his heart.  He is also so amazing live that he never sings a song the same way twice.  This man is gifted. Period.
B0000844I8|5.0|I love this idea of an interstelar passageway, Stargate. I do believe something like this could actually exist. I saw it in the theatre when it came out and had not seen it since. I decided to finally get the DVD and see it again, and I was once again reminded why I enjoyed it so much. This ultimate edition is a nice additon to your Sci-Fi collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're not a science fiction fan, don't dismiss this so quickly.  (Let's ignore the fact that it owes at least as much to the Western genre.)  True sci-fi cannot be told without the science.  Firefly, on the other hand, features themes, characters, storylines and humour that would be at home in any dramatic genre.  Think of it as a brilliant story that just happens to be set on a spaceship.    Firefly has genuine warmth.  You can't help but care for each of the nine main characters, all of whom have interesting personalities, interactions and backstories.  It's both solid drama and solid comedy.  (Happily, these two areas mesh well.  Most of the laughs come from character interaction, so they doesn't distract from the more serious moments.  If anything, they add to them.)    On top of that, Joss Whedon's writing is PAINFULLY sharp.    As the film adaptation \\"Serenity\\" proves, the pen is mightier than the sword.    If you're after some ingelligently written, mature, humorous, engaging and ultimately uplifting entertainment, you owe it to yourself to buy this boxset.  (Or check out the two-hour pilot, also titled \\"Serenity\\", THEN buy it.  But that's only prolonging the inevitable.)
B000002AVF|5.0|This is the 6th album from the most beautiful, powerful voice in the world, Mariah Carey! Daydream was the last, just straight up pop/adult contemporary album from Mariah. Since this recording, Mariah has had at least one hip-hop collaboration on every album put out. Don't get me wrong though, I love every Mariah album because they are all different in some way, from each other and I do love Mariah's amazing voice so much, even on Charmbracelet! So to me, even with the hip-hop collaborations, every album is a must buy!<br /><br />The very first song on Daydream, Fantasy, was actually one of Mariah's many firsts in the music industry. Fantasy debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 1! Mariah has had many singles go to #1 before but Fantasy was the very first single from her which actually just became #1 from the beginning, not having to climb to #1! I totally love Fantasy which features a sample of the Tom Tom Club's \\"Genius of Love\\" and all the remixes and club mixes but the album version has this really cool and unique music so that's why I love the album version best. The music video for Fantasy is awesome too because I love amusement parks, especially roller coasters! And there are at least two music videos for Fantasy, one is the album version and one is the remix with O.D.B. Underneath The Stars is a really romantic, slow ballad and it always makes me picture what the song is about, being outside somewhere with someone I love romantically, having a romantic evening, with a sky full of stars!!<br /><br />One Sweet Day set another record for Mariah. Not only was One Sweet Day the 2nd single to debut at #1 but it spent a total of 16 weeks, 16 consecutive weeks on Billboard at #1! No other female artist has ever done that before and no one since has been able to break that record! One Sweet Day is a ballad with Mariah and Boyz II Men and I love this song so much even though it's kind of sad about losing a loved one. The next song, Open Arms, is a cover song, originally from the rock/classic rock band Journey. I actually heard a sample of Open Arms from Mariah before I got the Daydream album and even though it was only 15 or 20 seconds, I was totally blown away by Mariah's remake. I had heard the Journey version a lot before I even knew Mariah was covering it and I thought Journey did a wonderful job but once I heard the whole Mariah song after getting the album, it just totally took my breath away! Mariah sings with so much emotion and power and it just blows the original out of the water! Don't get me wrong, I still like Journey's version but there's no denying that Mariah has the voice of an angel!<br /><br />Always Be My Baby became the 3rd #1 single from Daydream and it's one of my favorites from the album. Every time I hear this song, I have to sing along and I love all the remixes of the song too which include Da Brat, Xscape, and Lil'Vicious. I also love the Always Club Mix and a shorter version of the club mix called the Def Classic Radio Mix, the David Morales mixes, and trust me when I say get the CD single with the David Morales club mixes! I know the David Morales mixes a lot of times, sound the same but not Always Be My Baby. I love the club mixes so much that I paid $100 to someone in England because the single was never released in the U.S. and it was so worth it. It's the U.K. CD single of Always Be My Baby with the David Morales mixes. Always Be My Baby isn't my all time favorite Mariah song but I must say, when it comes to club mixes, Always Be My Baby is the best club mix I've ever heard and it took me about 8 years to get the single and I am totally happy now!! Trust me, get the U.K. CD single with the club mixes if you can, you won't regret it!<br /><br />I Am Free is a really cool slow ballad that I love. When I Saw You is another favorite and I love Mariah's voice on this incredible ballad. Long Ago is another uptempo song that actually is a mix of pop and R&B, it's cool! Melt Away, which was produced by Babyface is another wonderful, romantic ballad that I love because of the way Mariah sings!! Forever is another song from Mariah that leaves me totally breathless! Mariah's voice totally soars on this wonderfully, powerful, romantic ballad. Definitely a favorite of mine from Mariah! The next song is the Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix) which is just a sample of the Def Club Mix of Fantasy but I do notice some lyrics in this that weren't included in the club mix. \\"Daydream Is All That I Can Do, I Feel Raptured Over You\\" is the part that isn't on the full club mix but overall, it's the sample of it. It's really cool having the first of many interludes from Mariah on this album. Looking In is the perfect album closer because it's just Mariah and Piano in the front and center with what sounds like a distant orchestra in the background. A very hauntingly, beautiful ballad that I love and the whole message is very powerful with the closing lyric \\"They'll Never Know The Real Me.\\"<br /><br />Daydream spawned 3 #1's, Fantasy, One Sweet Day, and Always Be My Baby which are favorites but others include Forever (one of Mariah's best vocal tracks!), When I Saw You, Open Arms, Underneath The Stars, and Looking In but I love the entire album so much! This Daydream album is 10 years old and it's as amazing today as when it was first released!! Daydream is a must buy for any Mariah Carey fan!!was produced by Babyface is another wonderful, romantic ballad that I love because of the way Mariah sings!!

B00005AQE8|5.0|\\"All Eyes On Me\\" is a must have for any Hip Hop Fan.  Pac managed to pack 2 CD's full of straight up westcoast classix.  This album is by no means mediocre, very few rappers have even come close to outdoing it.  It's crazy how quickly he put this together after being released from Prison....but however he did it, well done
0802130208|5.0|My God, what a beautiful story! I have never laughed at a written work so hard in my life as the first time I read *A Confederacy of Dunces* during a summer break when I was twenty years old. John Kennedy Toole's dialogue -- sometimes witty, sometimes deliciously dumb -- pierces the the quaint pieties of Southern America and the staunch dogma of the Catholic Church as both institutions are hurtled into the frenetic dystopia of the future. Behold Ignatius Reilly, self-righteous hypocrite and bygone moral authority: so loudly out of place in his own century that he both condemns and embodies the sins and petty schemes of a civilization in collapse. <br /> <br />In reading *Dunces*, I was haunted by the author's ultimate tragedy, as I'm sure most readers are. The dialogue is so rich, the characters so compulsively funny -- so *intimately* funny -- that after frequently laughing so hard I gasped for air, I became outraged at the literary establishment that passed on this brilliant work, and at the vicious elite that drives its brightest talents to desperation. <br /> <br />*Dunces* gave me a love for New Orleans that I have never been able to pay back with a personal visit. Sadly, the New Orleans of John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece has been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. By most accounts, it seems that the Crescent City will never be the same, largely due to George W. Bush and his own confederacy of dunces who failed to rescue the drowning city for nearly a week in 2005.  <br /> <br />It is likely that *A Confederacy of Dunces* will be one of a very few American comic novels to merit preservation for the next several centuries. I pray that the city that gave birth to it will live as long.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|First off:I loved this movie.I am a straight/African/American male with combat military experience.In my opinion...anyone who dose not atleast like this movie for it's cleverness ,multilayered characters,and complex plot needs to needs an education in film appreciation. People It tells the story of real life people in love during  WWII.(there is an extra-maritial affair between a map maker an a married woman,the revenge bent friend of wronged husband/thumbless thief,and the nurse who discovers love in it's different aspects than just the physical(love for the title character and and a bomb difuser.Those people who can not appreciate all these elements are in need of some help.I think everyone needs a copy of this movie on DVD/Video in their movie library.
B00008S2VG|3.0|So, Mariah has gathered her little \\"lambs\\" to try to destroy Madonna's career (look at [...]) I know Mariah didn't start this, but it is widely reported that she is not denouncing it either. How sad that fans are so insecure of their favorite artist that they have to spend all day trashing another artist. What's even worse is that Amazon.com, which is supposed to be objective, is allowing these posts. I'm not saying to get rid of bad reviews. However, it is clear which reviews are bad and which reviews are meant to be malicious. <br />     Ok, now a review for the album. I definitely have mixed feelings about this one. I think the reason it flopped so badly (in the US) is because it was released at the time that anybody who spoke out against the president was punished. Now, it is popular to criticize the president. In any case, there really is no anti-Bush statement in the album (it was all in the original video). Songs like \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" \\"I'm So Stupid,\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" are the most self indulgent songs I've ever heard. I thought Madonna was smarter than this! On the flipside, songs like \\"Nothing Fails,\\" and \\"Intervention\\" are musical masterpieces. It's too bad that people overlooked the album and didn't hear those two songs. Those are probably two of the most brilliant songs Madonna has ever done. In any case, lets hope her upcoming album is more coherent.  <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|I'm not a great fan of Limp Bizkit, but Fred Durst is obviously a great fan of The Who. When I read the reviews stating the The Who ripped off Limp Bizkit I fell out of my chair laughing. These children that spit out their opinions on subjects they know nothing about are going to be the downfall of Rock n Roll. Without classic rockers like The Who and others, Fred Durst would not have been inspired to be a musician, just ask him. Limp Bizkits attempt to recreate Behind Blue Eyes was their tribute to The Who. Fred Durst would be embarassed to know his fans are so ignorant as to not know anything about Rock n Roll at all. After pulling myself off the floor I found myself disgusted. Kids who believe that The Who are any less than pioneers of Hard Rock are part of a Teenage Wasteland indeed!
B0009UC7HA|1.0|The first half of this movie was kind of interesting but still far fetched, a civil war ship in Africa with a treasure to find.  It then turns into a far fetched evil corporation poisoning the world water supply on purpose with solar panels in the middle of the desert?  And ends with a few shots at the U.S. government policies. I was hoping to have fun watching this film, and did for a little bit, but it turned into a barf fest with a poor plot.  The hidden messages from hollywood is beating a dead horse and very predictible.  Corporations are evil and will poison the environment.  No one cares about Africa.  Bush sucks.  America sucks.  It is not worth fighting for your country.  Give your money to the poor.  Give it up Hollywood, people want to enjoy a movie and escape from reality for a while, not have your crazy political views shoved down our throats.  Another bomb from Hollywood that didn't have to be.  Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
B00003CXI1|4.0|It took me until the release of Half Blood Prince before I started reading the Harry Potter books, and then finished them all within a month. Then I had to get the films - I swear Harry Potter has become my latest obsession! Even though I hated the first book with a passion, the film was so much better, although it does drag in the middle. And obviously there's gonna be a lot missing from the books, but minor bits so far - I dread to think how much is going to be cut from the films in the later ones!<br /><br />What had me transfixed about this movie was a very small thing - that recurring theme that keeps playing. I love it! It sounds like a lullaby, or even the tunes that play in one of those jewellery boxes that you have as a kid (I did anyway). It's also the tune that is played to send Fluffy to sleep, and Hagrid is also seen playing it at one point. I have never loved a piece of music in a film before as much as I do this one.<br /><br />The actors in this are brilliant and even the kids are quite good. I'm definitely gonna be crushing on Daniel Radcliffe in the later films by the looks of it! I do hope the kids get to play Harry, Ron & Hermione right through to the very last film. I also love the little characters that appear, although some of the ghosts didn't turn up as much - I do hope Peeves (played by Rik Mayall) appears in the later films, as I loved him. I loved the way John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick) appears, although I originally mistook him for Billy Connolly! And I loved Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane, and I was fascinated by the way they managed to film him looking so much bigger - can I please borrow his platforms?! Although if you look closely in the very first scene where he appears, he looks a normal size. Robbie's 6'10\\" body double for Hagrid is former England rugby international, Martin Bayfield. I must applaud JK for making sure all the cast were British in this, apart from a few exceptions: Richard Harris was Irish, and Zoë Wanamaker, though she has made her name as a \\"British\\" actress, is actually a US citizen. Alan Rickman, although having a very small role initially, was fabulous as Snape, although he seemed to be wearing more makeup than I do on an average day. Did anyone else notice the look he gives Malfoy in the first Potions class?<br /><br />Steven Spielberg was originally offered the role as director, but can you imagine he actually wanted Hayley Joel Osment to play Harry? I just cannot imagine that working!<br /><br />I hated the fact that the film & book were changed in the US, from Philosopher's Stone to Sorcerer's Stone. It's so stupid, and I do hope they don't change any of the other names. And the region 1 has a better cover.<br /><br />I hope some of the later films get a higher rating, as the later books get more adult orientated. The word 'bloody' appears in the film six times, along with one 'arse', one 'bugger', and two 'blasted's. This, and some apparently scary scenes in the haunted forest, led to its PG certificate. Frankly, they were not that scary!<br /><br />Most of the stuff transferred well from print to film, especially Quidditch & Platform 9 3/4. While the movie used Platforms 4 and 5 at Kings Cross to represent platforms 9 and 10, there is, in fact a \\"Platform 9 3/4\\" at Kings Cross. It's located in the walkway area between the intercity section and the section where the real platforms 9 and 10 are, and was obviously put there for fans of Harry Potter.<br /><br />I have to say, I would have preferred a bigger glimpse into the classes, we really don't see many of the classes, or the different passwords to get into the dormitories. (I HATE that word.) I suppose this was unnecessary to show in the films. And I don't remember the staircases moving in the books though? And why did we never see the history teacher who was a ghost? I physically hate Tom Felton, who plays Draco - he's just the kinda face that only a mother would love (in the film!), especially with that slicked back hair.<br /><br />This is a DVD where the extras are hyped up loads, and fail miserably to deliver. I thought they were lousy. Why were there no interviews with the stars? Why did we have to listen to Chris Columbus babble on, with a bunch of other people we don't care about? Why was the adventure 'game' so hard to get through? The extras are way too complicated for a child to get through, just to see some deleted scenes - some of which should have been left in - and I ended up severely frustrated, when I couldn't get through the Potions class. And the transfiguration 'class' is nothing.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be watching the next 2 DVDs very soon, and I'm going to lose myself in the Harry Potter world. Now I just have to wait `til November for the fourth film, and god knows when for the last book!ly with that slicked back hair.  <br /> <br />This is a DVD where the extras are hyped up loads, and fail miserably to deliver.

0316172324|1.0|Let me save the trouble and fill you in on what this book is actually about.  To sum up, it's basically 254 pages telling you that within the first few seconds of observing something like art, a marriage, a product idea, etc., you can have as accurate of a view or assumption of it as you would in a year of observation.  What makes this even more hilarious is that his examples of \\"instinctive decisions\\" are from experts in certain fields: a psychologist, a  coach, antiquities experts, doctors, etc.  Wouldn't you think that an expert in a field, let's say a doctor, would instinctively be able to give a more accurate interpretation within seconds of a sick person then say a mechanic?  Uh...yeah.  So let me save you the time, trouble and $25...trust your instincts and you'll be fine.  I just can't believe someone drew out such a dull and pointless topic into 254 pages.  So my final thoughts...in 2 seconds, I could tell this book was a waste of time so I stopped reading it.  Well done Gladwell!
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Eric Clapton is now married and has 3 girls under the age of three. Eric has become more domestic and wants to be with his family. That is the theme of this CD. Eric is letting you know what is important in his life right now.  This CD contains various types of music, all the way from Reggae, to Rythm and Blues to even Soul and Jazz. About the only thing you dont hear is Blues.  Eric Clapton in my opinion is better, when he does less covers and more of his own material.  The songs on this CD that attract my interest are his own songs.  There are covers by the late George Harrison, The Spinners and others.  Eric Clapton has taken two years to make this album and it shows.  The CD is very well put together. Eric has worked very hard on everything including the vocals. From a technical point of view the CD is very solid.  In my mind some of the finest songs he has EVER written are on this album.  The songs that attract my interest are \\"So Tired\\" where he talks about the sleepless nights taking care of the baby.   Eric lets you know he is having a good time rasing children though. Lost and Found is a rocker by Doyle Bramhall that is probably his best song on the album. Bramhill adds a new dimension to Clapton, Bramhill is not only a capable guitrist but a very solid slide player as well  His slide playing allows Clapton and Bramhill to record multiple slide guitars.  One track mind is another great song that he wrote for his wife and his devotion to her. The dobro in this song is very good. I love to listen to Clapton play the dobro.  Run home to me is another song that has the same taste as \\"Only the broken hearted\\" from his Pilgrim CD.  \\"Back Home\\" closes the CD. In my opinion this song is at least the caliber of \\"Tears in Heaven\\" it could be the finest acoustic song he has EVER written.  I would recomemd this CD to anyone, and especially Eric Clapton fans...................sit back and enjoy
0060516402|5.0|Mr. Collins here is able to spot the need of organizations nowadays. Just like human, we find the fact that organizations in itself is also mortal. They can die (bankrupt), eaten up (acquired), or even merged. The bottom line is, they won't last long if they're just being ordinary. That separates the good ones from the great ones.  <br /> <br />As Mr. Collins had concluded from his research, there are certain similarities between some of the great companies (e.g. IBM, General Electric, 3M, Boeing, Procter & Gamble, etc.), which he further implied is also applicable to any organization nowadays. He gave the examples in his book which shows that even those great companies didn't always start out as a good or healthy company. Such as Sony, he said that it was a company which was started just in a garage, but with the greatest of idea, and that was what makes it great. He also gave the example of Boeing, a company who bet their future in a single, large, but very risky project which could've bankrupted the whole company.  <br /> <br />You will all find his examples interesting. I get a very valuable knowledge from this particular book. I find that this book is able to fulfill the needs of anyone's dream for a lasting organization. For you people, who dreams about leaving a legacy for the future beyond your mortal life, this book shall definitely be a MUST READ. Okay!
B000AADYRQ|1.0|Major label = major lack of anything resembling music. This band was on the downslide anyway with Transrottenism but what is this? Music? Not really. Postal Service at least had a beat, and hooks galore, this has nothing.  <br /> How would you like to be the guitarist in a band that no longer involves guitar? You can just see the rest of the band  waiting to get through this boring excuse for an album and play some old stuff. Fans will be waiting too. If you were listening to this live, you'd surely leave to get a beer, or just leave after hearing too much of this album.  <br />Mark my words, this band will fall apart, and fall apart soon. How could any of the members want to suffer through Gibbard's new style? And why do we have to listen to Gibbard moan and ache over some lost love over, and over and over!?!? Every freaking song is the same!  <br />
0060555661|5.0|I've never written a review for any book before. But I can't keep myself from not writing a review for this particularly great book. This book is definitely second to none for anyone who considers themselves an investor or a wannabe' investor. All I've ever heard before is only that Benjamin Graham is the teacher to the greatest investor in our modern times. I don't even know why Mr. Buffett considers him so special, that he's willing to work for Mr. Graham f.o.c. Now, I've realised from this book that Mr. Graham is such a great man, with an outstanding viewpoint and brilliance of mind. This great man was able to open up a whole new knowledge for us at the time when even the world of investment itself was still chaotic (his career began in 1914), and what's even greater is the fact that his invented knowledge (of value-investing) was and is able to overcome the passage of time up until our era. <br /> <br />What I found in this book opens my eyes to the whole new approach and perspective to investment. I've never known that value-investing would be such a great new knowledge for me. It's quite extraordinary I think, that although this book's been around for decades and the method's been proven many times, people still tend to do the same mistakes over and over. We keep seeing bubbles, burst, bubbles, burst, again and again.. But let's take the positive side from them, in this case if those people hadn't made those mistakes, we wouldn't have been able to gain our share of profit.  <br /> <br />I think this book is a must read when you're considering about investing. You might find that the way Mr. Graham writes this book would be quite difficult to comprehend initially, so never hesitate to read them again over and over. And my next suggestion is, take the knowledge to your mind when you're calling the action.  <br /> <br />To wrap this up, as Mr. Graham said in his book many times, although what he's written has been able to overcome the passage of time up till now,there will always be something new in the world of investment. And so does this book, shall pass away... But in the meantime, JUST READ IT. OK! Have a great exploration! <br /> <br />

0812966066|4.0|With echoes of Edgar Allan Poe, this 1902 novel continues to delight mystery-lovers.  Elegantly written in formal prose, the story focuses on the moor surrounding the ancestral home of Sir Henry Baskerville, an American who has inherited it upon the mysterious death of his uncle Charles.  The moor is so treacherous that no one dares venture upon it at night-one step off the path, and the mire will swallow the unfortunate victim.<br /><br />Family legend says that a sadistic Baskerville from the eighteenth century once loosed a huge and ferocious dog in pursuit of a woman who had escaped his clutches, and that she had died of fright when she heard the dog panting behind her on the moor.  The lecherous Baskerville, in pursuit, had had his throat torn out by this \\"dog from hell.\\"  The ghostly dog can still be heard howling on the moors, and many believe it was the dog which caused the elderly Sir Charles Baskerville to have his fatal heart attack.<br /><br />In classically Gothic style, the novel features mysterious cries from the moor, foggy nights, an escaped prisoner, signals by candlelight, a butler who knows more than he says, a beautiful woman with a mysterious past, a small boy who carries messages, and someone who spies on the dark and isolated Baskerville Hall.  Sherlock Holmes plays a lesser role in this story than he does in most others, remaining in London while Dr. Watson accompanies Sir Henry to his estate as an observer and protector.<br /><br />Holmes, of course, is operating behind the scenes, learning about the activities at Baskerville Hall through the daily accounts which Watson sends him (and which reveal much of the action to the reader).  By no means the bumbling character which films have portrayed, Watson offers sensible advice to Sir Henry and shows a keen eye for details of  interest to Holmes.<br /><br />Though the prose is often \\"purple\\" with melodrama and overwrought description, this contributes to the fun of the novel, providing a dramatic counterweight to the extreme logic of Sherlock Holmes, whose late appearance in the novel comes as a carefully timed surprise.  The story is intriguing, the mysteries are well developed, the atmosphere is suitably spooky, and the resolution, though not really surprising, is appropriate.  Even if the story had not been made into a memorable film with Basil Rathbone, The Hound of the Baskervilles would still be justly famous as Conan Doyle's best developed mystery, a genuine classic of the genre.

B00005JNTX|3.0|I can't address \\"Sin City\\"'s content because this is a polarizing film - either you adore it or you don't, and you already know which camp you belong to. Love it or hate it, \\"Sin City\\" is an amazing technical breakthrough. Roberto Rodriguez has always stretched his low budgets to the limit, but with \\"Sin City,\\" he proved that greenscreens and computer technology need not be limited solely to science fiction. The digitally-inserted backgrounds and compositing of different actors are totally convincing. Furthermore, unlike previous attempts at the technique (which look like Photoshop on acid), there's a realism present here that leads me to believe that smart producers in the future will rely more and more on greenscreens and less and less on location shooting. This is a rare example of special effects that are totally in service of the story. I think it's worth a look for that reason, especially if you're a budding computer-savvy filmmaker.    How strange and cruel, then, that only a skimpy mini-documentary is included as a behind-the-scenes extra. They could bring us multiple \\"collectable\\" DVD cases, but they couldn't give us real insight into the making of this movie? This is nearly as bad as the very earliest DVD releases (such as \\"2001\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\") in which there were absolutely no extras to speak of. Why? Just a year ago a movie like \\"Sin City\\" would be a two-disc affair with extras that did everything short of telling us whether Rodriguez and Miller prefered ham sandwiches to cole slaw and now we get a bare bones package! It shows real contempt for the fans of this movie.    If you absolutely must own this DVD right now, there's nothing I can say to persuade you otherwise. As for me, I'm riding this one out and waiting either for the inevitable upgraded version in a few months or a substantially cheaper used copy. Frankly, it's insulting that they can't give us extras but can give us our choice of four different DVD covers. It's a gimmick worthy of 1990s comic book companies, but totally unacceptable for a major Hollywood release.

Please....Please...Let's get creative without the use of \\"Hos\\" and extreme graphic \\"violence.\\" Are male comic-book authors so dull in their senses? This movie was crap!

B0000DJZ8R|1.0|I bought this item primarily because of the special features which were described in the blurb regarding this product; unfortunately most of these special features were missing from the DVD I received. I cannot remember what all the special features were; but, I do remember that the DVD was to contain newsreel footage from the 1930s regarding the dust bowl and other filmed materials from he 1930s which chronicled the events on which John Steinbeck based his novel. I ended up returning the DVD

6305078491|5.0|\\"Vampyr\\" (1932 - 75 minutes - B&W), is a shady spectacle of morbidity, directed by the brilliant Danish director, Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889-1968), one of the most important names of the cinema history. The movie is based on the classic \\"Carmilla\\", of Sheridan Le Fanu, and tells the story of a man called Allan Grey (the actor Julian West), a studious of vampires. He arrives at a city to investigate a supernatural case and find, in an half-abandoned inn, an enigmatic old man and his daughters. The old man, without explanation, gives a book to Grey and asks him to open the book only after his death. The book contains important information about vampires. Carl Dreyer began his career as a journalist making summaries of films. In Germany, he knew the photograph director, Rudolph Mat&eacute;, the wizard of the gray and black and white tones. With the partnership of Mat&eacute;, Dreyer could caught all the ways of the German Expressionism movement in its beginning, with the delirious scenes, a lot of make-up, subjectivity of the characters, light effects to show the contrast between darkness and lightness, and the emotional and Metaphysical narrative. The first film of terror to show a strong emotional and psychological content was \\"Nosferatu\\", of Murnau, in 1922. But was with \\"Vampyr\\" that the style was more evident. In the film, where dream and reality mixes, the director studies many styles, exploring the light contrasts, to talk about aspects of the interior and supernatural universe of his characters, what allowed the Dreyer-Mat&eacute; partnership to place all their originality. For example: they used until gauze on the lenses to create some Metaphysical and misty effects in some scenes of the story.<br /><br />[...]

I found the audio sound quality to be excellent and much more enjoyable than when I watched on television, even though I had played the broadcast through my stereo.  If you like the Eagles at all, you'll thoroughly enjoy these DVDs.

0140187537|5.0|I like Steinbeck a lot and I admire his ability to adeptly write about so many different themes in his various novels. Out of all of his books, I think this is one of the least known, which is really too bad. Steinbeck's prose and descriptive ability never falters; he makes the book come alive but never overwhelms the reader with detail. The variety of characters (another one of Steinbeck's traits) usually would seem like too much for this relatively short novel, but each one is memorable, adding another layer, another necessary part that makes this novel work so well. This book's themes, especially the theme of whether it's worth it to sacrifice ideals in order to get ahead, are applicable to this day and age and ensure the timelessness of this novel.

0895260131|1.0|Before you attack me for bing a liberal, which I am not, or for being a Jihadist, I am Jewish, please let a semblence of rationality sink into your heads.  After picking up this book and laffably flipping a few pages before dousing it in gasoline and lighting it up, I must let you all know that this book a work of propaganda the Soviets would have been proud of.   <br /> <br />As a student of history, I have a fondness for the crusades and a interest in Islamic history also.  Having grown tired of modern polemic authors trashing Islam in order to make money off of ignorant americans who still only think of an Ottoman as a piece of furniture, I was struck about the added phrase (And the Crusades) tacked on to the title of this otherwise unmemorable book.  Fury soon set in. <br /> <br />The Crusades were trumped up military excursions against a dominant civilization by the excess progeny of a divided and factuous one.  The closest parallel I can relate to in the modern world, is the Mujahadeen fighting the soviets in Afghanistan.  Both were efforts of fanaticism on the outside, cloaking a healthy internal mixture of political power struggles and economic motives.   <br /> <br />While the crusades were not on the whole evil, like some liberals today claim, the were certainly not acts of self defense.  Pilgrims in the east were suppressed by marauding turks, who were also attacking the Muslim states in the levant who were protecting the pilgrims. Those Turks then began imposing penalties and sometimes inhibitng the acess of pilgrims into the holy land.  Thus, rumors of pagan acts of cruelty spread and mutated, and the pope was given a cause in which to unite warring Europe and fight the dominant power in the western world which was untill the 1400's, the Islamic Culture.   <br /> <br />Massacars of jews and eastern christians by the crusaders were frequent on the way there and after initial sucesses, they were eventually repulsed and driven into conflict with Constantinople.     <br />Ultimatly they were a military failure, with the kingdoms established falling appart within a century and spawning a Turkish backlash which within two centuries extinguished the last remenant of Roman power.   <br /> <br />Any effort alone to transform the Crusades into a just and sucessful war is a act of idiocy and ignorance. <br /> <br />Please ignore this author and all his works for now on.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|It may be too early to make a final judgment, but overall I am optimistic when looking at the state of the movies in 2005.  Others may talk of declining box office, but I see a rosier picture when it appears that the audience is becoming more discerning.  Derivative action flicks like Stealth stumble out of the gate, and not long ago, the same happened with the sequel to XXX. <br /> <br />Subtitled \\"State of the Union,\\" XXX 2 is merely an excuse to watch things blow up.  There are the vestiges of a plot involving a coup attempt by the Secretary of Defense, but the story is merely an excuse to get from one silly incident to the next.  What's the most inane scene in this movie:  the ludicrous prison escape or the final battle sequence which involves the recruiting of a bunch of gang members who all apparently never do drugs and have a vague sense of patriotism?  There are probably a dozen other choices. <br /> <br />The intent of the original movie was to showcase extreme sports in a James Bond parody, and it was quite successful.  With Vin Diesel's replacement (a perpetually scowling Ice Cube) an ex-SEAL, we basically lose what made the first movie original.  Instead, we get a clichd action flick that has been done better dozens of times.   <br /> <br />So maybe movie audiences are getting better at recognizing garbage when it comes out, and maybe that in turn will lead to better movies.  Yeah, right. <br /> <br />
B000002H38|5.0|On its release, immediate comparisons between Anita Baker and Nancy Wilson/ Sarah Vaughan abounded.  These comparisons were a compliment, of course.  However, Anita Baker really is in a class all by herself. <br /> <br />\\"Rapture\\" is such a classy album.   The difference here was that Ms Baker didn't have to alter her style to cater to a mainstream audience; instead, that mainstream audience came to her. <br /> <br />I remember listening to this album for the first time all those years ago - it was such a breath of fresh air.  Ms Baker's unique blend of nuanced soul, adult contemporary pop and modern jazz was a stunning. The album opens with the soaring vocals of \\"Sweet Love\\" which is excellent.  However, it's \\"You Bring Me Joy\\" that puts shivers down my spine.  The calibre of this gorgeous track is out of this world.  I'll give this one 10/10! <br /> <br />\\"Caught Up In The Rapture\\" is perhaps the most radio-friendly track on the album.  It's a real easy, mid tempo track with a lovely, catchy chorus. <br /> <br />\\"Been So Long\\" is a sophisticated, jazzy track with a Sarah Vaughanesque vocal performance.  There's not one duff track here and I can quite happily listen to this album from beginning to end - without skipping any tracks.  The music has stood the test of time and it still sounds fresh when played today.  If you haven't discovered the treasures of this album, I recommend that you give it a try - you won't be disappointed! <br />
B00003CXCW|5.0|When Joe Gillis, hack screenwriter, makes a wrong turn while avoiding creditors, he winds up at the decaying mansion of Norma Desmond, a silent movie star whose days of glory are a couple decades in the past.  Now, she lives an almost hermit-like existence alone with her taciturn and loyal butler.  This accident leads Gillis into a writing job as she plans her return to the big screen, and later into a role as gigolo.  This in turn, will lead somehow to his death; there is no spoiler here as Gillis's death is shown in the opening minutes of the film and most of the movie is told in flashback. <br /> <br />Superficially, Sunset Boulevard is a dark, almost noirish, satire of Hollywood, but even more than that, it is a ghost story.  Norma Desmond, although technically alive, is really a ghost; like a ghost she is trapped in the past, constantly reliving her life and denying that she is a has-been (the Hollywood equivalent of a dead person in those pre-Surreal Life days).  Her mansion has the look of a haunted house, and once Gillis enters this abode, he is doomed.  He doesn't have the strength to fight the spirit haunting this home. <br /> <br />Almost everything in this film works well:  the acting, the writing, the sets and the direction.  Gloria Swanson, as the over-the-top Norma, steals the show, and I was personally amused by a bit part by Jack Webb, playing a far more animated character than his more well-known Joe Friday.  There is a reason that this movie is considered a classic, and although over fifty years old, it is still worth watching today.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I just want to say that holiday IS the passenger by iggy pop. And that Jesus of surburbia or one of those songs IS summer of 69. And the lyrics are lame. By the way, if your one of those jackasses who thinks this album is better than Tommy, die.
B0006J28KU|5.0|I was very, very pleased with the product. I will in all likelihood order from Amazon in the future. Thank you.
6302561841|1.0|Almost everyone who has reviewed this film gave it 5 stars, and the lowest it got from anyone was 4.  Well, too bad. <br /> <br />This is a dreadful film. <br /> <br />I laughed about 4 times during the whole thing.  A lot of predictable, obvious, unclever slapstick, and awful lot of it really contrived or just stupid (I longed for death during the interminable scene where he goes round and round the dance floor carrying the tray). <br /> <br />But the worst part of all was the \\"social commentary\\" aspect.  This film is pure luditism.  In a nutshell, Chaplin couldn't handle the fact that technology-- talkies-- was displacing him and his silent movie approach, and so he railed against all technology.  NINE YEARS after talkies came in, he's still stubbornly clinging to silents; apparently these \\"talking pictures\\" are just a fad.  It's the most pathetic of crusades. <br /> <br />Oh, and it's not hard to see why people thought Chaplin was a communist.  The character of the owner of the steel mill might as well have lept off the pages of Marx himself, he's such a grotesque caricature of a capitalist, sitting around doing jigsaw puzzles, reading comics, and yelling at the proletariat to work faster. <br /> <br />Happily, for the most part, the movie doesn't maintain this virulently anti-capitalistic tone.  But its attempt to capture the pathos of the depression is itself pathetic.  When the factory reopens, Chaplin exclaims \\"Work at last!\\"-- but the reality is that he's already had THREE jobs during the movie, and he lost ALL of them through his own incompentence, not because of the depression.  The great moral stance that this movie takes is that it glorifies bunglers and thieves. <br /> <br />Let it not be said, though, that I found nothing good in the film.  Chaplin's stunt work (I assume that was actually him) in the blindfolded rollerskating scene is mindbogglingly good.  Truely remarkable.  I'd gladly trade the whole rest of the film for just that scene.
B00003CXSP|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  A tale of revenge on the part of one of Hannibal's former patients, and a tale of redemption for Julianne Moore's Clarice Starling, this film works on these polit levels and more.  The setting of most of the film, in Italy, lends a feeling of dramatic tragedy and is well-served by its inclusion in this movie.  If the movie has weakness, it may be the dullness of the inter-office politics int he beginning of the film (though, yes, I know that it is an important component in establishing her motivations for the rest of the film).  Also, the movei could have left out the unrequited romance between Starling and her FBI boss, played by Ray Liotta.<br /><br />For thsoe who keep score, if I had to rank them I'd say Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, then Red Dragon (a remake of the original Manhunter).<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...

OK - I've stated the obvious - now onto the more particular info...<br /><br />I have always had an interest in vampires, gothic subjects, etc.  This movie does a great job of getting into the inner workings of a mythical/created vampire sect (coven) and makes the journey of discovery interesting.  Also, the weapons employed in the movie, the special effects, and the soundtrack are also deserving of mention.  If you like the dark, you'll like Underworld...<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

For some who say this sound the same of this and that, I know thousands of band that sounds the same, there's some but not alot of innovations made in music these days, sometimes it feels like everything has been done. Their songs are still original. Some are for the mainstream and some are what they really wanna do. It's better than simple plan trust me.    Edit : By the way I forgot to tell you guys, just listen to the last Metallica album and tell me what it sounds like...
B00005JKG7|3.0|The original The Fog (not the current remake now in theaters) is really one of the rare genuine thrillers of the 70s horror genre (to include Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc.).  The plot itself is original enough (if rather simple and predictable) and the acting is rarely over the top and fits in well with the film. It really is a good, quality horror film that merits at least one viewing.  I just watched this today, actually (hence the review) and I wasn't diappointed.  I am a bit leery about the new theatrical release, but I guess we can review that one when it comes out :)<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

B0009UC7H0|2.0|This movie was originally a book written by Clive Cussler. I expected a lot more thrill in a movie compared to both James Bond and Indiana Jones. Boths of those movie series were spectacular but this wan't. This movie also was very lengthy at two hours and 3 minutes. With Mathew McCounough, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz I expected more but in my ming it was a big bust. Just rent this one and throw it out the window when you are done.

B000AAF276|4.0|After buying \\"Back Home\\" I was somewhat dissapointed after a first listen. I loved Clapton's Me and Mr. Johnson stuff and I'm the first one to jump on his Derek and the Dominoes, Cream and blues stuff. This CD does not represent that side of him.   <br />     <br />    HOWEVER, after a second listen through I realized that there is much to love here if you are a soft rock Clapton fan. This CD is very eclectic, jumping from reggae and soft rock to R&B and blues. Many sweet sounding songs that work well together on the album. Definately worth a listen. And I think ill like it even better a third time through :)
B000002MFN|5.0|Overshadowed by controversy, this is one of Madonnas best albums it features classic hits like Deeper and Deeper, Erotica, Rain, Fever and my personal faves on this CD, Thief of Hearts and Secret Garden. Released in 1992 this album still sounds great!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never did see the show on TV.  I bought the DVD set some time after it came out as a present for someone else, who (as it turned out) already had it - and so I kept it, thinking to watch the series someday since people seem to have liked it. <br /> <br />And there it sat for about a year. <br /> <br />Finally I sat down one late evening, I was bored and thought - why not finally take a look? <br /> <br />After staying up 'til 4am watching the whole first disc, I thought to myself \\"my girlfriend has to see this\\"!  It combined elements of all the things she loved - comedy, romance and wit into an amazing package with amazing actors.  Sure enough she loved it just as much as I and over the course of the week we consumed everything we could from the DVD's. <br /> <br />Now there could not be two more avid Serenity fans.  We eagerly await the movie and even plan to post some posters for the movie around town - and are trying to get as many people as we can to see the DVD. <br /> <br />All this for a show I never even saw on the air or even cared about until I found it years later on DVD.  Nothing else has inspired me quite like Firefly.

B00005JMFQ|3.0|I had trouble deciding if I should take this as a fairy-tale/romantic comedy, or a statement on love in general, or what. Parts of it were wholly depressing. I mean, the guy bought the necklace! But it wasn't for his wife! (sob) And she found out! But she couldn't let the kids know! (sniffle, snort) But parts of it were really... well... romantic, I guess, if implausible. My favorite was the guy and the girl who spoke different languages, but fell in love anyway. All in all, I was confused by the end.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|This is an amazing film.  The graphics on this film were exquisite.  It just goes to show that Keanu Reeves can play any part.  He is a exorcist that is trying to buy his way into heaven by casting demons back into the hell from which they came.  There is only one outcome to this breath taking plot.  Will he get in or will he get rejected?  You have to see it to believe.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|This all-gal soap opera (except for the underrated and versatile Dominic West)takes us back to 1950s Welleseley College to be hit over the head with the message that women were either repressed by men, repressing themselves, or both.  But an Auntie Mame art teacher (of course...it's Art.  Nothing so banal as history or Latin...) in the form of toothy Julia Roberts breezes in to shake up their world and leave moist eyed feminists dabbing with hankies by the campy closing credits.<br /><br />Is this the female take on Dead Poet's Society with a little of The Children's Hour, thrown in?  Or a complete meager ripoff of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie?  All the cat-eye glasses and girdles in the world can't make the young female cast look any less anorexic conetemporary...and even glamorous Roberts, who eschews much makeup, looks horribly out of period.  A great opportunity for creative art direction and/or cinematography was missed.  The usually great Marcia Gay Hardin romps throughout like she is in a \\"Lifetime\\" TV movie...which is where this one belongs.<br /><br />Fortunately, the star power of Roberts and the talents of Gyllenhall and Stiles make it a watchable film.  (The usually splendid Dunst, like Hardin, seems to be merely phoning in a community-theatrical performance!)<br /><br />The music, though, is fun and fans of soap opera will enjoy this.  The DVD special features, unfortunately, are negligible.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Just because you liked the first 2 Coldplay cds don't think you're necessarily going to like this one.  I love the first two, but this one leaves me totally flat.  Not that it's a departure... it's no departure at all.  Maybe their \\"thing\\" is just getting a little tired.  Or maybe this is just an uninspired interval and their \\"thing\\" will come roaring back on the next cd.  (Or -- and don't bet on this, at this point -- maybe next time they'll try something a little new.)  I certainly don't insist that a good band reinvent itself with every new release, but these particular tracks are just a big bore, period.
0385512104|5.0|This book was forced on me by my mother.  Everyone of a literary bent who I've spoken to including many of my friends all know about it.  We seem to regard this book as a pretty brilliant read. <br /> <br />Living in England the outstanding quality of the work is the way it captures something of this country, particularly in London like patterns on the seats of an underground train or the details of shops - familiar to some of us - in a way that makes them stand out.  We no more take them for granted.  This is about our everyday world that is so often not mentioned in specific.  In this context this book is very much a British work that relates to an English setting from the time it was written in terms of environments, names, dialogues, educational institutes/systems and everyday lives and problems. <br /> <br />The protagonist is incapable of feeling the emotions of others and the book is very much an exploration of feeling.  I've heard that the book is a very accurate portrait of autistic thinking and it seems to be based on a great deal of research and experience. <br /> <br />This book is audacious in its style but the story itself is no tangle.  There were so many scientific and mathematical details in the book that the character relates that really taught me something I had no grasp of. <br /> <br />I cannot truly confess to understanding the feelings of others but this book leads me to understand those who feel them and their own feelings differently - perhaps less.  The protagonist is not devoid of feeling but they are not registered so consciously except perhaps for the key emotions like sadness or fear. <br /> <br />When his mother cries with grief all he observes is that she wails like an animal in a TV documentary.  He cannot feel her pain.  But his emotions are registered by him reacting violently at a physical level even though he can't explain them.  Such contents evoke a certain humour but also a deep pain which is never expressed explicitly.  But the teenager does have a firm notion of right and wrong which we cannot disagree with and a good sense of direction - even if he can't explain why being so daunted by the complexity of the future.  Thus he has an inimitable form of wisdom that guides him and helps him cope. <br /> <br />The protagonist comes across generously in sharing his autistic world with us which is not a cold one and often highly mathematical and logical.  Optimistic at the end, this is a profoundly effective style of simple narrative designed to convey something of the universe, England and human emotion.   <br /> <br />Graphics, maps and diagrams uniquely keep the work afloat and animated.  We literally see how the boy thinks at a visual level. <br /> <br />I think the book emphasises the importance of feelings in our world and how we relate to them and manipulate them.  It challenges our sense of values in the context of feelings and hopefully encourages us to develop our sensitivity to our feelings and those of others.  <br /> <br />
B0007Z0OL8|5.0|Trey Parker and Matt Stone's puppet picture has far more quality than I had expected.  While sparing the audience none of the vulgarity expected from the South Park duo, this film is remarkable nonetheless.<br /><br />Before watching \\"Team America: World Police\\" I was put-off that it used puppets, but watch it and you will marvel at the genius of their decision.  Animation falls flat in comparison to the three dimensional puppet experience.<br /><br />Amazingly, the best part of the picture may be the songs.  Most were written and sung by Parker and Stone.  I just bought the soundtrack CD which is supposed to have additional material.  The music is that good!<br /><br />One tip.  Let the ending credits play out.  Shortened versions of the songs are played, and included is one not in the film.<br /><br />Don't watch it with children, but watch it.  You can thank me later...unless you're a member of the Adam Baldwin fan club.
B000002N25|5.0|Golden Heart, in my opinion, is Mark Knopfler at his finest. All of his solo albums are well worth owning, but this one ranks in the top ten of my all time favorite recordings. Knopfler has the unique ability to identify with the characters in his songs in an honest, heartfelt way without being overly semtimental. The range of style is impressive and Knopfler's guitar playing is at it's best. He can  wring more feeling out of one note than most players can do with an entire scale. The album is a pleasing mix of electric and acoustic tunes. After listening to this well-balanced set two or three times, it will be hard to choose a favorite song. They are all worthy candidates!

B0002EXFNI|5.0|The \\"Boy Next Door\\" is the inspiring story of a young boy's beginning the journey into manhood........and in doing so, undertaking the quest of saving a girl from harmful forces overtaking her.  That's right; it is only secondarily the story of this one lucky, lucky, girl who, through a fluke of chance, happens to find perhaps the only person who can save her from what she's becoming and doesn't want to be.  Yet under all there is this girl who can help this boy come to be so much more.     Yes, this is really the tale of a \\"special\\" boy next door whose faith in someone (the girl next door) is so strong that it can literally save her from a life of possible ruin.  And Matthew is \\"special\\" in so many ways, but mostly in his ability to hold onto that innocence (most of us lose) which enables him  to continue believing in people and their goodness, even as he grows older.    You tell me:  Isn't Matthew someone you would want by your side?  Isn't Danielle, too?    ****
B00005JN5X|4.0|Heath Ledger and Matt Damon give a very good performance in this tale of witch hunting under French occupation in 19th century Germany. The only incongruous character is Cavaldi, the Italian henchman, played by Peter Stormare. Cavaldi is too excited; he detracts from the action.<br /><br />Mixing reality and fairy tales was a very good angle. Funny and dramatic in rapid succession, the action keeps you laughing and wondering what craziness is going to happen next!<br /><br />Sets are full of detail, down to the dirty shirts, the dirty faces, and the mud on the streets. The sky is grey until the witch is killed, and it gives the whole action an eerie halo. There is even an old hag you would think is a real witch! The fearful peasants complete the picture for a very effective look.<br /><br />This feature is money well spent.

B00005JNJV|4.0|Christian Bales has an upper body fit for Batman. He also has an emotionless gaze that is fit for the bat hero, except when he kisses his love: it then becomes wooden and awkward. Cain is excellent, as usual, and Holmes is also beyond reproach. Neeson is the bad guy but he looks and acts like a good boy: delightful.<br /><br />The dialogue is average; it is truly an action movie. I wonder why such good actors are in such a feature?<br /><br />The gems in this movie are the sets and the fight sequences, of course. You get it all to your heart's content.<br /><br />This movie is well worth you money if you are into action features.
0312955006|4.0|At the rate he's going, Connelly is threatening to overtake some of the more notoriously prolific genre writers. If that is indeed the case, The Conrete Blonde can always be looked at as classic Bosch, with the hardhitting LAPD detective showcased at the peak of his abilities. <br /> <br />As always, Connelly's writing is superb, infecting the familiar story of a tough cop in LA with a poetic flair that elevates it above the genre. While the subject matter is too lowbrow to ever merit inclusion among the great classics of literature, Connelly's language skills are on par with the finest modern literary authors. What's more, we don't sacrifice the thrills, hard-hitting action, or breakneck plot pacing for an instant. <br /> <br />In some of the Bosch novels I feel like there is a twist too many, but I found this outing to be spot on, and very satisfying. This book, and this series, is a perfect marriage of police procedural, action, and human characterization. Bosch understands and loves LA, and the way that he puts it all on the line in defense of LA citizens is truly touching at times. <br /> <br />You won't find a better crime author than Connelly, and you won't find many entries stronger than The Concrete Blonde. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009PVZWI|5.0|Just when I thought the Foo Fighters couldn't do any better after 2003's excellent One By One, they come back with a thunderous roar with 2005's In Your Honor.  Basically, this is 10 new electric hard-rockin songs and 10 softer, mellow acoustic songs.  The electric songs keep me going at work, and the acoustic songs are great for when you want to wind down and chill out at night. <br /> <br />A note about these people who are saying that the CD side of DualDisc is copy protected.  Newsflash: <br /> <br />While yes, the regular CD version is \\"copy protected\\", there is not a single DualDisc that has EVER had copy protection put on the CD side.  Not a single release from any record label.  Just because your computer's CDROM drive can't read the CD side of the disc does not mean it's copy protected.  It just means it can't read the disc, just like some regular audio CD players can't read the CD side either.  I own over 15 DualDisc titles from a variety of labels and artists (including this one), and have never had a problem ripping the CD side of any one of my DualDiscs into my Toshiba laptop. <br /> <br />Class dismissed.
0064407667|4.0|This book, like all of the others in the series, is formulaic to the extreme. It is repetitive, making the same jokes over and over. And the three central characters are defined by little other than a single trait apiece. <br /> <br />So why the heck are they so good? <br /> <br />The Lemony Snickett jokes are all very similar and predictable, it is true, but they are also consistently funny. There's just something about the understated tone and the Snickett poker face that compensates for any of the book's weaknesses (and even turns some of the weaknesses into strengths). <br /> <br />This first book in the series starts off with the death of the Baudelaire parents, which leaves inventive Violet, bookworm Klaus, and toothsome Sunny alone in a grim world. The children are the picture of reason and civility, but the adults around them all seem to be either monstrously incompetent, as in the case of Mr. Poe, or just plain monstrous, as in the case of distant relative Count Olaf. <br /> <br />Olaf is a cartoonish villain, but he is also pretty frightening. He makes no bones about the fact that his only interest in the three orphans stems from their enormous fortune, which Olaf hopes to lay hands on as quickly as possible. Things escalate quickly, and the orphans engage in a battle of wits with Olaf and his detestable theater troupe, culminating in a very palpable threat to infant Sunny's life.  <br /> <br />These books are a bit dark, perhaps, but they are also full of gentle humor. While the noble orphans are not expected to triumph, we get the idea that they will never come to serious harm either, even when potential salvation plans crumble into dust. The tongue-in-cheek nature of the overblown characterizations keep perceptions of the book as pure entertainment rather than a cautionary tale. <br /> <br />Parents should consider adding this to their reading list for bedtimes. The chapters are of a convenient length, and the chatty framing device of Lemony Snickett lends itself well to a storytelling atmosphere. It's also very nice to see a book that propagates reading, engineering, and vocabulary skills in a way that is simultaneously in your face and very subtle.  <br /> <br />Snickett will never win a Pulitzer, but he will win the hearts and minds of children around the world. <br /> <br />Enjoy!

B000000OAC|5.0|\\"News Of The World\\" was released at a time of punk fiasco, with bands such as The Sex Pistols making stabs at prog-rock bands and creating a whole new wave of music which was furious and heavy. Although Queen didn't have any plans to completely alter their sound at this point in their career(even though they did make a drastic change in the 80s), they went with a much more straighforward style of rock, while also experimenting with some new pop sounds. This would be Queen's last album of the 70's, and from then on they would completely change their direction as a band, which led to the use of synthesizers.<br /><br />The first two tracks should be known across the world as classic rock anthems, the first being a punch of heavy rock, with a heavy drum beat and in-your-face lyrics. The following is a sweet ballad which in this day is a celebratory song at any sporting event. \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions\\" are and will remain two of Queen's most popular songs. Roger Taylor's first contribution to the album is a super heavy rocker entitled \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", boasting very straight forward, crunching guitar riffs and a very interesting vocal from Mercury. \\"All Dead, All Dead\\" is a pretty pop tune, featuring a relatively simplistic, yet effective melody. \\"Spread Your Wings\\" is Deacon's best song on the album, a pop/rocker which is in the same vain as \\"You're My Best Friend\\", which can be found on \\"A Night At The Opera\\". It finishes very strongly with May's solo. \\"Fight From The Inside\\" is a punk rocker coming from Taylor, and as well as composing the song provides the vocal and rhythm guitar.<br /><br />\\"Get Down, Make Love\\" opens up Side 2 of \\"News Of The World\\" with a dark, and powerful feel throughout the track. Mercury provides some of his most risqu&eacute; lyrics, and ultimately delivers them perfectly, setting the mood for the song. May's guitar swifts through the melody beautifully. \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk\\" may be the most straightforward track on here, as May experiments with a different style of rock then what he's used to composing. \\"Who Needs You\\" is the most poppy song on the album, and will take awhile to grow on you. However, it proves Deacon's exceptional ability for composing pop cuts. \\"It's Late\\" is the only notable epic on here, a 6:26 long rocker divided into seperate scenes, and arguably the shining moment on the album. Brian May compiled some great lyrics and strong guitar riffs, and Mercury's vocal and Taylor's heavy drum clashes bring it all together with perfection. \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" is a soft, jazzy track which ends the album rather well.<br /><br />Overall, \\"News Of The World\\" is another 70s classic from Queen, featuring some of their best rock moments, while also boasting touching melodies and brilliant lyrical qualities. Along with any other album from the 70s decade, it remains essential for any Queen fan, and ultimately a good buy also for the completist. Highly recommended along with basically the rest of the Queen catalog.n here, as May experiments with a different style of rock then what he's used to composing. \\"Who Needs You\\" is the most poppy song on the album, and will take awhile to grow on you.

0385338686|5.0|I have read all, but 1 book I just learned about another one (The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic - which I just ordered). Again, an enjoyable read. I didn't want the book to end!

B0001Z363W|5.0|I have downloaded all of Black Label Society's albums, and even Book of Shadows and Pride & Glory, but this was the first album i bought in stores. I am a die hard Zakk Wylde fanatic, so, naturally, i love this CD. It combines Zakk's heavy riffs, with his soft melodies like the ones from Book of Shadows, and of course, his ripping solos. I believe that Zakk Wylde is easily one of the top 3 guitarists of all time. If you are a first time Black Label listener, however, I would not reccomend this CD. In order to fully appreciate Black Label Society, you need to start off with Sonic Brew, or Stronger Than Death. Some good songs on those CD's are: Bored To Tears, Lowdown, Beneath the Tree, 13 Years of Grief, and Love Reign Down.
1591396190|5.0|W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne's Blue Ocean Strategy: How To Create Uncontested Market Space And Make The Competition Irrelevant turns upside down all the insights on strategic success which have formed business foundations in the past. Most companies battle success in an ocean of rivals over shrinking profits: industry boundaries are defined, common, and prices driven lower. Those companies which reach beyond this formula experience explosive growth, as Apple did with the iPod and Curves with its women's fitness centers in an oversaturated fitness market. These innovative companies made proven models of success obsolete by going beyond strategic formulas - and you can, too, using the methods advised in Blue Ocean Strategy.
B000001GRE|2.0|It's baffling when you think you have ears and you dislike a performance that gains wide praise. This Mahler Seventh from Boulez and the Clevelanders was dissed by the Gramophone in 1996, pointing out the very low energy level, measured pace, and lack of passion. This \\"isn't Mahler as we know it,\\" they said. And I must agree, much as I admire Boulez's Mahler First, Fourth, Ninth, and most especially his highly successful Eighth. But in the Sixth and Seventh I feel he goes completely astray.<br /><br />The Mahler Seventh was one of Bernstein's great specialties, and he produced great music even thorugh its longeurs and banalities -- the Seventh isn't inspired in every bar. The recent Abbado reading from Berlin conquered the same difficulties through playing of unsurpassed delicacy and refinemennt, keeping you engaged with the mystery every moment.<br /><br />And Boulez? Chilly and rhythmically slack. We get this conductor's famous transparency and attention to detail. There's wonderful playing from the orchestra, but the essence of the whole piece escapes him, and no amount of technical perfection can substitue for taking us into Mahler's emotionally complex world.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Excellent transaction, this CD was in perfect condition. I've spent hours of amazing fun listening to Madonna. thanks so much for such a great transaction!
B000001GOZ|2.0|Although I can't deny Boulez's greatness, this performance didn't appeal to me at all. I find the first movement (marked Allegro energico) too relaxed; it left me completely uninvolved, and although the other movements improve, there is no impression that the Sixth is a tragic symphony. The composer himself provided that adjective. Why Boulez decided that bland literalism was called for is beyond me. The Scherzo lacks bite and irony. The finale isn't as smoothed out as the first two movements -- Boulez places the Scherzo second -- but it is still woefully lacking in mystery and explosive tension.<br /><br />Those listeners who like the cool, analytic virtues of Boulez may praise this CD, but compared to the recent Abbado with the Berlin Phil, not to mention a volcanic live version from Tennstedt and the London Phil., this almost suave performance is chilly and uncommitted, despite gorgeous orchestral playing. Tragedy should be tragic, not mildly melancholy.
078693123X|5.0|I finally decided to start reading the series of Forgotten Realms novels after meaning to for several years. I knew I wanted to start out with a Drizz't novel and figured starting with the book about his birth and escape from the drow would be a great place to start. All I can say is that if the rest of the FR books are only half as good as this one, I'm going to be doing some late night reading. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read the rest of this series, the Clerics Quintet, and the rest of the series based on the Drow written by Salvatore.
B00004TL2N|5.0|...the reviewer who gave this astonishing performance three stars because the Adagio movement lacked mystique may lead one to think that Boulez has replace Bruckner's spirit with his own. Actually, that's true, for his version of the Adagio is strcutrually clear, precise, and without much rubato to underline emotion. But for some reason this turns out to be alchemy--the Adagio is one of the greatest things about Boulez's reading.<br /><br />But, then, I should disclose that my Bruckner collection is full of Karajan and Giulini and bare of Wand, Jochum, or Hiatink, all of whome this reviewer extols for mystrique. I find all three flat (even though Haitink performed a wonderful Bruckner Seventh with the BSO in recent seasons and an equaly superb Eighth with the Vinnea Phil in Carnegie Hall).
B000002BYD|5.0|Anyways this album is overated and good and yada yada. Yet another one of Pearl Jams best. Most of these songs should be played on the radio. Ten has had its moment of radio play, let the people hear other PJ tunes, but of course the radio only plays what people already know and love. The radio chooses what you listen to. Thats what makes many albums so special is because they aren't played on the evil mainstream commercial radio demon. Why listen to what they want you to hear and get out there and listen to what you want to hear. Trust me you'll find better music out their at a cd store then anything on the radio. So if you like 90s music, Pearl Jam, good music etc. Then I suggest this should be in your rock and roll collection. Much great music to be heard by all is on Yield, like \\"Brain of J\\", yet another great opening song for PJ. With \\"Faithfull\\" the album gets a bit better. \\"No Way\\" it gets even better again, this song is really cool. \\"Given to Fly\\" ok this album keeps getting better, amazing song!!! \\"Wishlist\\" Just as amazing and the album still gets even better. \\"Pilate\\" Ok, good, but the album has better songs. \\"Do the Evolution\\" is really cool and in your face. \\"Red Dot\\" which on the album is actually labled as a red dot, unique idea and a really cool experimental song. \\"MFC\\" Pretty good, but nothing mindblowing. \\"Low Light\\" Nice and slow song. \\"In Hiding\\" Good song yet again, ok the second half of the album is not as awesome, but still very good and worth a listen. \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" Pretty cool. \\"All Those Yesterdays\\" Great closer!!<br /><br />Yield at a store near you and buy this Pearl Jam album!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I've always liked these guys, but comparing this to the strength of their last couple albums, I think it comes up a little short. Some people may blame the major label on it but I think they've just made a kind of plain sounding album.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|As a follow up to the slick Toxicity, SOAD have managed to make that third studio album stand out further than the previous. The style is different, whether other reviewers agree or not. The album pulses frantic urgency from the very theatrical beginning (Soldier Slide) of the experience, because that's what it is, until the very end with the Radioheadesquish, nauseated \\"Lost in Hollywood\\".  <br /> <br />SOAD seem to have understood the mechanics of Rock better than any other modern day group; the album is a show taking you through various stages of emotions which most other groups would kill for. All the while managing to not compromise their credibilty as a politically outspoken, representative force. <br /> <br />Moreover, more importantly, it rocks. At no stage of the album, apart from the very last song, do you not find yourself moshing to the incredibly powerful riffs thrashed out by Daron (\\"Old School Hollywood\\" providing the hardest, catchiest riff) now incorprating harder metal elements into the sound. John too has altered his drumming, bringing in more double kicks on the bass to add weight to the sound.  <br /> <br />As with many other System fans, I feel Daron's vocal exposure is at time excessive, but suits particular songs like \\"Lost in Hollywood\\". The sheer disgust, \\"all you maggots smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard\\" is perfect. However, Serj remains the vocalist the fans want, hopefully Hypnotize will satisfy that.  <br /> <br />On the whole, stunning. And we're crying for our next fix...
B000AA4LAK|4.0|One year after the Killers' debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\" was released, it is now re-released as a \\"limited edition\\", with 3 additional tracks that have been available on various singles.<br /><br />\\"Hot Fuss Limited Edition\\" (14 tracks, 56 min.) brings the original 11 tracks first. By now, the first half of the album sounds like a \\"greatest hits\\" album, that's how familiar tunes like \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\", \\"Mr. Brightside\\", \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" now are. But the rest of the album is quite good as well, with tracks like \\"Andy You're a Star\\", \\"Change Your Mind\\" and \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\". The bonus tracks are quite good as well, in particular \\"Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll\\" (although the Killers by now are hardly indie). \\"The Ballad of Michael Valentine\\" is so-so, but \\"Under the Gun\\" is grade A quality and would have fitted nicely onto the album proper.<br /><br />This re-release is intended to tempt those on the fence that for whatever reason hadn't bought the album yet. Like me. (My 15 yr. daughter had bought it, so I was familiar with the album.) I'm glad that I bought this. If on the other hand you're REALLY into the Killers, your probably have those additional tracks already.
B00004Z459|4.0|Many bands attempt to make hybrid music. Mixing rock and pop, hip-hop and rap. But nobody does it better then Linkin Park, who's musical hybrid of Rap/Rock/Techno has won over fans the world over, me included. <br />Each song on thier decut album, Hybrid Theory, is great in its own way, and almost any fan of any genre could find something to like here. Here's my song by song review.<br />1. Papercut: 3/5 this isn't a bad song, its just not a great song. Some of the vocals are weaker then the rest of the album and some of the lyrics arent up to par with thier other songs. But overall, its still a pretty good song, and a great way to open the album.<br />2. One Step Closer: 3/5 this is one of the bands most popular songs, and I can see why other people love it, but it just dosent come across as amazing to me. Its just to loud. I dont really have a problem with loud, but it distracts from the meaning of the song to much. But its still a good song, and worth a listen.<br />3. With You: 5/5 this is the first of the 3 best songs on the CD. It has great lyrics and vocals. But the main reason that I love it so much is because it really shows how well Linkin Park can balance techno and rock. It has some great guitar riffs, but even better turntable peices. Unfortuanately, this is one song that you either love or hate, and most people hate it. I loved it, but I guess it just depends on the kind of person you are.<br />4. Points of Authority: 4/5 its a pretty great song, and one of the favoured among Linkin Park fans. Unfortunately, it dosent meet best of the CD standards, but it's still a welcome edition to the CD and certainly not the worst song on here.<br />5. Crawling: 5/5 second of the 3 best songs on the CD, Crawling is another song that expertely showcases Linkin Park's ability to mix techno with rock. It has some of the best lyrics seen on a Linkin Park CD to date, and Chester's vocals are absolutely amazing. Along with that, it has one of the best and most memorableintro's done by Linkin Park turntablist, Mr. Joe Hahn. All together, an amazing song that almost anyone can enjoy.<br />6. Runaway: 3/5 if I was asked to completely remove a Linkin Park song from the world, this would probably be it. Im not saying that it's a terrible song, im just saying that it's one of thier weaker efforts. But it's still a pretty good song, it just didnt amaze me as much as thier previous efforts. <br />7. By Myself: 4/5 this is another one of thier loud songs, but this time the screaming and heavy metal guitars work in its favour (unlike One Step Closer). It also has great lyrics, and some great rapping by my favourite emcee, Mike Shinoda. I love how this song goes between being uber-loud, to being soft and quiet. It was close to being a best of the CD, but it just didnt make the cut.<br />8. In The End: 5/5 the third of the 3 best of the CD is probably the best. It had one of the best vocal performances by both Mike and Chester, and its almost impossible to get that amazing piano riff out of your head. It does an amazing job of balancing its great piano sounds with its rocking guitars, and for that it earns the honour of being the best of the CD. Oh yeah, the lyrics are great to!!!<br />9. Place for my head: 3/5 another one of thier weaker efforts, Place for my Head is probably one of the worst of the CD. Its not bad, but its not that good. It didnt amaze me, and frankly, the riffs are kind of boring. But its still listenable, and any Linkin Park fan should listen to it at least once.<br />10. Forgotten: 3/5 its another loud song. Again, as with One Step Closer, Forgotten dosent use it's loudness to its advantage. The lyrics are also not up to par with the rest of the CD, and they even resorted to rhyming one word with the same word. But, fortunately the great guitar riffs and vocals save it from being a complete flop, and overall its worth a listen.<br />11. Cure for the Itch: 3/5 its not relly a song, it's an istrumental. Some of the turntable riffs are great, but they get repetitive fast, and the random vocals scattered throughout the song distract from that. But its still good for an instrumental, and gives you a chance to hear Mr. Hahn without the distraction of vocals or other instruments.<br />12. Pushing Me Away: 3/5 it is again one of thier weaker efforts, and one of the quieter songs on the CD. But it features Chester singing in top form, and some great guitars.<br />Overall, I dont truly dislike any song on this CD, but some are weaker then others. But its still an amazing debut, and I would reccomend this to anyone. Great job Linkin Park!!!
B00080ZG10|2.0|I already had my doubts when I started watching \\"The Aviator\\" and call it prejudiced, I didn't like it any more after finishing the more than 2,5 hours the film is. <br /> <br />That's criticism one right there: it's too long, it just goes on and on about planes and how he is afraid of germs. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, if you read bio's of Howard Hughes you see that most of it is in the movie. The filming and editing are all in order. Thing that bugs me most is Leo DiCaprio. He still is too young to take on roles like this. He was great in Catch me if you can or even Gangs of New York, there he is casted correctly but not here. Someone like Jim Carrey was named to as a possible Howard Hughes, I think he or someone his age would have been a better choice.
0743455967|5.0|This is an excellent book for first-time and veteran writer's alike who are looking for advice on where to go next from a trusted source.  King comes across like that favorite uncle that you had that encourages you when the path that you follow is one that your parents might not think is practical.  <br /> <br />The book itself is broken up into three parts that illustrate King's inspiratation, understanding of the elements of writing, and how writing impacted his life after his accident (and vice versa).  It is primarily focused on fiction writing, however journalists and educators have plenty of King's experiences to draw upon in the text. <br /> <br />The sections on \\"What Writing Is\\" and what to put in your writer's \\"Toolbox\\" drive home simple and effective messages on how to best prepare yourself for \\"the craft\\".  Although there are a lot of books on writing mechanics available that have more technical observations of writing requirements, this one provides the basic elements and inspiration that are useful for any would-be author.
B0000640SA|5.0|Unless you have seen the movie before, you won't be able to appreciate the special casing that the Limited Edition comes with nor do I recommened really looking through the extra papers etc. until you watch the movie.  But once you have seen the movie, it is good fun to look through.  Momento is a great psychological thriller.  You will have no idea what is going on the first time through, but dont let that stop you from finishing it.  I highly recommened this movie even if you dont get the Limited Edition.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Thank Iceland for Bjork's sirens and Sigur Ros for their sweeping chamber pop.  Without the country, music purists would have been still waiting for the next ripple in history (an Icelandic revolution?).  'Music as natural environment' is much more affecting than any urban/industrialized influences, and it atleast is obvious to me, unlike developed nations, that Iceland holds its natural wonders on a religious level.  I cannot recommend this album enough on the basis it contains universal qualities as well as earthly elements.  As one critic said, \\"It moves mountains.\\"   <br /> <br />I also recommend The Verve's \\"A Storm In Heaven.\\"  It may be the most \\"balanced\\" (Yin & Yang) rock album in music history (as the title suggests).  The teaming of legendary producer John Leckie with guitarist Nick McCabe's wall-of-sound/distortion/feedback visionary prowess is unbelievable.  It's like combining heaven & hell, dark & light, beauty & tragedy, all in one, nearly all with guitars, and nearly as broad as a full blown orchestra.  Like Agaetis Byrjun, it's masterful.
B000001FS6|4.0|Some of their best songs are in Rattle and Hum: Desire,Pride, Love Rescue Me, love comes to town,etc... There were a handful of live songs I didn't care for, but overall this is a great album that U2 fans will enjoy.
0156027321|2.0|Like the rest of those who didn't like the book, I too was most intrigued by the first 1/4 of the story.  The other 3/4 seemed to have nothing to do with the beginning, was bogged down with violence and gore I wish I hadn't trudged through.  Some people said that those who really love animals shouldn't read this- they're right.  I adore animals, and hearing about their suffering with no satisfactory ending was most frustrating.  I am surprised by how many people praise this book when it seemes so thoroughly unconnected to itself.  (I gave it two stars because the beginning was SO good.  If only he'd continued in that direction, it might have made for a fantastic book.)
6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton's \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" directed by Henry Selick, is a classic that is sure to please Burton fans and skeptics alike.  Originally released in 1993, this film was the first full-length stop-motion animated feature to be released.   <br /> <br />The film traces the wonderfully creepy Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, on his journey to better understand Christmas.  Having become frustrated with the creepy celebrations surrounding each October 31st, Jack encounters the odd-acting residents of Christmas Town and likes (but fails to understand) what he sees there.  In his efforts to spread the joy of the holiday season to the wacky residents of Halloween Town, however, Jack unknowingly wreaks havoc and mayhem on the good boys and girls of the world, attempting to take on the role of jolly St. Nick himself. <br /> <br />The story is delightfully original, the characters humorous and zany, and Danny Elfman's score fits the film like a perfectly molded glove.  Keep your eyes peeled for Burton's soon-to-be-released \\"Corpse Bride\\" as well!  This film was and still is a movie milestone.  Very highly recommended!
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I say Kudos to Adam Sandler and all cast. This movie was funny, witty, and it didn't sell out on just pure ignorance. Despite being an enjoyable comedy, the storyline had principle. For me, anyway, it was a pleasure watching, I was laughing throughout.
B00007AJF9|4.0|While most DVD commentaries discuss trivial details like which camerman ate tuna for lunch and how hot it was on the day of filming, this DVD commentary actually delivers!      The director discusses the history of the queen Elizabeth as well as the choices made to tell her story in this film.  For example, the camera often spins around Cate Blanchett/Elizabeth to indicate the many conspiracies that threatened Elizabeth.      In addition, the commentary discusses moral, philosophical and historical issues, not just technical details.  For example, it discusses Elizabeth's reception of Mary's ring under a large tree, and explains that this scene was filmed from afar, since it is recorded history and putting us far away makes it feel as if we are viewing history from the present (from afar).  But when the emotional character of Elizabeth becomes important, the director moves the camera in closer.  Or that he filmed Norfolk as \\"stone,\\" tough, hardened and determined, while he filmed Walsingham, Elizabeth's key ally, as \\"water,\\" fluid, flexible and behind-the-scenes.  Water will wear out the stone in the long run, he says in the commentary.      The director also discusses the film's central emphasis on the development of Elizabeth from a young woman into a position of political power.  He states, \\"To be a great leader, you have to be totally detached,\\" and his film and his commentary amply display Elizabeth's progression from emotional youth to powerful monarch, with all of the benefits and costs to her and those who love her.     I found that the viewer can even watch the commentary but still follow the plot (unlike some where all you get are the visuals with the commentary blocking out the story itself); in other words, the commentary is not a second experience that could've been put on a separate disk, but it follows hand-in-hand with the film.  Obviously, you might want to watch the film first without the commentary, but my point is that the commentary enriches, without wiping out, the story with comments of historical and directorial importance and interest.    All in all, I found the commentary track to be a great complement to the film, and not the superfluous distraction that commentary tracks often amount to.  It enhanced my appreciation for the film in particular, and for film-making and storytelling in general.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I loved the CD.  I had it before, but was robbed, so I replace it.  I highly recommend it.   <br />
B00008K7AM|3.0|\\"The Hot Chick\\" pretty much beats out its bad teen comedies competition and is a whole lot more subtle and cutting edge than \\"Freaky Friday\\". I normally do not find Rob Schneider particularly entertaining but because he is only one of three main characters he does not feel compelled to carry the whole movie and his performance is reasonably restrained. Normally I feel much the same about Adam Sandler but he is hilarious as the bongo playing \\"you can put your weed in there\\" salesman.    The classic scene is when the mother falls on the family cat, complete with expected sound effects.    Rachel McAdams and Anna Faris are excellent. McAdams \\"Mean Girls\\" performance was obviously not an accident and fortunately Faris can play someone besides Scary Movies' Cindy Campbell. Maria-Elena Laas is perfect as McAdams rival.    What elevates \\"The Hot Chick\\" are many subtle components in its mixed bag of humor. Although much of the scatological humor is moronic there is a whole lot of underplayed stuff that is flat-out funny. For example: when the security guards arrest Bianca for shoplifting one of them says \\"you are coming with us Winona\\" and when McAdams is opening the box jewelry box the suspenseful music is being supplied by a stoned Sandler on the bongos.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000002G87|3.0|Layla is hailed as Clapton's best work and one of the most popular albums in rock history, but I think it's vastly overrated.  Don't mistake me, I'm a big Clapton and Allman fan, but I think Duane's Strat on the Domino sessions sounds tinny compared to the rich sound of his Les Paul at the Fillmore.  The first three tracks without Duane are short and focused with some of Clapton's best guitar work.  The rest of the album features Allmans's guitar, which at times sounds like he added it after the original tracks were recorded.  In my opinion, these songs are over-produced and lose their spontaneity with so many overdubbed guitars that you can't tell what's going on.
0743490304|3.0|This is a nice book to spend a rainy day or weekend, or to have something to read while your kids are playing at the park. I thought this one was going to change my mind on Dan Brown's work but found it to be sort of repeating. It's like Brown found a recipe to write, then applied to every book he's written. I mean, this might be good for sequels, like Harry Potter or LOTR, but these are different stories. Anyway, nice reading when you have nothing else to do. Plot gets boring at some point and totally predictable.
B00005JKES|5.0|Make sure you also order the pilot episode or the first season won't be as enjoyable.David Lynch is warped in the head in the best way.
B000002NJS|5.0|This was Madonna's album that had more singles followed by videoclips: 5 (if I'm right, the reason of this review title).  That's a record for a pop artist!  The songs reveal her behaviour in that time : she was totally free from \\"material girl\\"(Madonna regrets it) and wasn't scandalizing like she did in the 80's or in \\"Justify my love\\" clip. She fixed herself and tuned her voice as we can see  in this recording and in You'll see (1996, my all-time favourite  Madonna song with Live to tell)   In general,the tracks are smoother and have more mystical feel if we compare to her prior releases.     When I first listened, I felt it. However,Madonna managed to do consistent songs with these differences. I remember putting my sound equipment loud with this cd playing at the first year I had it(when it was released, 1998). I don't have the habit of listening music loud -> the songs were special,in conclusion    I'm sure that Ray of light will be remembered as a classic in the future. It was her first cd with electronic sounds, but she didn't robotize her voice like in Music (2000).  Some comments and marks:    Drowned world/Sustitute for love : It begins quietly with syntetizers and sweet voice and then gets louder with a soft guitar. One single 10/10.     Swim : The sounds fit with water evironment. 9/10    Ray of light: \\"Quicker than a ray of light!\\" This statement was used for the videoclip (where we can see her blonde) scenes and for the track's pace. I love the chorus: \\" And I feel, like I just got home and I feel....\\"  The ryhthm is embracing . 10/10    Candy perfume girl: I remember seeng her performing it in a concert, but it isn't so special for me now. 8/10    Skin: The track I least like. The lyrics are a lover call. 7/10    Nothing really matters: The videoclip is inspired in Japan. Madonna's dance is kinda weird (her hair was black).  Its ryhthm is cool. 10/10    Sky fits heaven-> As the name suggests,it's like sky fitting heaven : gorgeous.It has India's influence, a reflex of her yoga practice. 10/10    Shanti/ Ashantagi: The maximum India influence. The language here must be an indian dialect, but don't be afraid, the booklet has the translation in english. Its a curious listen. 9/10    Frozen : The song that released this album. The clip has good chorographies, dark feel and it's interesting. Frozen overplayed on the radio(edited), but it really deserved. Memorable. 10/10    The power of goodbye: One of the most beautiful ever recorded by Madonna of all times. I really love its melody. She sang it on the party of Oscar. It had some radio plays too. The clip was filmed at the seaside featuring a polish and sad Madonna.   Giving it 10/10 isn't enough -> 1000/10!    To have and not to hold:  She said in an interview that this piece was based in a brazilian style called \\"bossa nova\\".  Excellent adjustment. Decent and pleasant. 10/10    Little star: The star of the title is her daughther Lourdes Maria. What a great praise! The vocals and the melody are perfect here. 10/10    Mer girl: It's a story that could have happened in dream. Maybe the lyrics contain her thoughts when she was meditating with her yoga!(ha!ha!ha!) It don't have ideas about the mark for it because it's more a story than a song.    This album and Bedtime Stories (1994) are her nineties strongest efforts. What are you waiting for? Buy it!!
0783229526|5.0|Based upon the classic Hunter S. Thompson book of his experiences with his attorney in las vegas, circa 1971.Johnny Depp stars as Thompson and Benicio Del Torro plays his attorney based upon the real life but said to be dead Oscar Acosta,writer of The Revolt Of The Cockroach People.Depp and Del Torro are great in their roles and deserved recognition for playing 2 people out of their minds on a trunk full of drugs.Terry Gilliam directs and as always his vision is dead on.The story is focused around these two characters but their are other characters that make appearances,played by well knowns.Tobey Maguire plays a hitchhiker,Christina Ricci plays an artist who only paints pictures of barbra streisand,Mark Harmon as a journalist,Ellen Barkin as a waitress and Harry Dean Stanton in a blink-or-you'll-miss him scene,amongst other recognizable faces.I've watched this film at least a dozen times and it never stops being hilarious.The film has been accused of glamorizing drug use,but it shows why it's necessary to be able to tolerate places such as vegas.A must see for fans of the weird and demented and open-minds alike.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Judging by my title you can tell my reaction. I'm a diehard Madonna fan of the 80's up to just after 'Immacualte Collection' came out, and a casual madona fan of her 90's work. I was very dissapointed in Madonna with 'Erotica' and 'Bedtime Stories' and only liking a few songs off those albums, but was blown away by 'Ray of Light' and 'Music', so as her music became great again I had high expectations for 'American Life' and with the lead single being 'Die Another Day' which i thought was brilliant, it made me even more excited. <br /> <br />But then I brought the album, and what a shock I got. The production is atrocious, it sounds like a crappy recording in a cheap studio, and the songs are way below Madonna standard. They have no melody and are accoustic mixed with electronica which was used on the 'Music' album and just got tired by her next album. <br /> <br /> <br />Great Tracks:  <br /> <br />Die Another Day - This song is amazing, I wish the whole album had this vibe <br /> <br /> <br />Average Tracks:  <br /> <br />American life - This song had alot more potential as it's great the way it sounds like two differnt songs when it gets slow then fast, but the production kills it, leaving it sounding very cheap <br /> <br />Hollywood - This song is pretty good, but nothing compared to Madonna's previous work, the performance on the VMA's made me appreciate it more <br /> <br />I'm So Stupid - The music to this and the way Madonna sings this is great, but the lyrics are awful, it usually shouldn't matter what the lyrics are, as a good song is a good song (just think 'Die Another Day' whose lyrics are questionable, but is a great song) but for some reason they just bring this song down <br /> <br />Nothing Fails - This song has a 'Like A Prayer' vibe with the choir, but nowhere near as good, but still a quite enjoyable listen <br /> <br />Mother & Father - Although this track has quite possibly the worst production on the whole album, this could have potentially been one of the best songs with a different producer as it's quite a distinctive song and beat. <br /> <br /> <br />Horrible Tracks: Love Profusion - I can imagine this song being a lot of peoples favourites, this song isn't awful, but it just doesn't appeal to my taste, I find it quite boring and I can't sit through it all. I was disapointed that she released it as a single <br /> <br />Nobody Knows Me - I go up and down with this song, sometimes I like it, but most times I hate it. Or more like, part of the song I like, but most of the song I dislike, especially the vocoder <br /> <br />Intervention - This song is very hyped among fans and they see it as a masterpiece and I have never understood why. It's a very boring accoustic song with no melody. Not very memorable <br /> <br />X-Static Process - This song isn't very memorable either, another boring accoustic song <br /> <br />Easy Ride - Same as the above two songs <br /> <br />Another problem I had was the vocoder was WAY overused on this album, and it was so unnecessary for most of the songs, except I think it worked on 'Die Another Day'. Also the lyrics are terrible, any 2nd grader could have wrote them. I seriously don't understand what Madonna was thinking by actually releasing this below average CD.
0790731479|5.0|Tim Burton's fantastic vision of life after death.Michael Keaton plays one of the best characters in film to the hilt and should have not been forgotten.Winona Ryder plays the goth-type daughter of Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones all who are great in their roles.The story though is based upon a couple,played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis,who drown in a car accident and struggle with the after life and the new owners of their beloved home.The movie is dark,especially when Baldwin and Davis have to go to the head of the dead to find out how to get rid of the new owners.It's interesting how those that have died tragically have to spend the after life working.Harry Belafontes music is put to good use in 2 big scenes.Definitely one of Burton's best works that should not be missed.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|While I do prefer Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, I feel that Burton captured the darkness of Gotham City in a way that I have imagined it to be. The score by Danny Elfman is easily the strongest comic book theme ever created for film and could you ask for a better Joker than Jack Nicholson? I hope Nolan brings in Tim Roth or Guy Pearce to play the Joker in the next Batman movie, but I don't think anybody could top Jack's performance here. Michael Keaton was my favorite Batman until Christian Bale came along. He had the right look and voice, but sadly lacked the physical requirements that Bale has. Ignore Batman Forever and Batman & Robin and stick to the only three Batman films that matter.<br /><br />Batman Ranking:<br /><br />1. Batman Begins *****<br />2. Batman **** 1/2<br />3. Batman Returns ****
B000096FUD|5.0|Terry Gilliam is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most visionistic fimmakers of all-time.With that said it breaks my heart seeing this documentary but am glad i did.It's about gilliams attempt in making The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,a movie that the great Orson Welles made an attempt at as well but also fell victim to 'Acts of God',as this film demonstrates the same.I recommend this to any movie fan as it shows what goes into making a film from post-production on,something i'm sure most people take for granted. As a dreamer of making my own films one day,I also recommend the same dreamers and future film directors to see this as it also shows how much strength,mentally and physically,you need to get into the business.This is not to scare you out of your dream, but to show you what it takes.Johnny Depp is the big name here and you get to see him at work as well.Just the couple of scenes that were filmed of him are funny as hell,which breaks my heart even more knowing that those scenes will never be used else where.Yes it's heart-breaking,but it's also entertaining.I won't go into anymore detail of what happens in this film as you need to see it for yourself.Yet another Gilliam film added to my library.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|At first I was shocked at how different it was. It took a while to sink in, but when it did, I was addicted.  <br />I tried to approach it with an open mind, but found it difficult after all the bad reviews I had read, so I expected it to be somewhat dissapointing. This is why it was such a shock. <br />The album blew me away.  <br />Everybody needs to get over the anti-copy complaints, because that is not the band's fault. They need to get a new record company. They wanted to do the golden ticket thing for all access passes FOR LIFE, but they weren't allowed. They love us, but Virgin hate us.
0385338686|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I've enjoyed Kinsella's books in the past, and this was just as much fun and entertaining. The story takes readers through the ransformation of Samantha Sweeting, a stressed out lawyer who leaves her old world behind to become a housekeeper. The story is witty, and even though it felt predictable at times, I couldn't put it down. Once again Kinsella gives her readers a sweet, fun, and easy summer read. <br />
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Boring. The only time I chuckled was Kip's reaction when he backed over the tupperware. However, I can understand how a 13 year old boy would find this movie entertaining.<br /><br />Since there is a whole class of movies that are worse than this, so I'll give it 2 stars, not one.
B0009Y336A|5.0|I also have been lucky enough to get my hands on this before the US release. As a long, long time fan of this band i continue to wonder how they fly so far under the radar, as oasis, blur, coldplay etc. get so much atention. Sure, i love the grass's more rocking numbers from past albums as much as the rest of you, but this cd's more mellow feel is just fantastic. Mid to late era beatles and the trippy acoustic electric side of zeppelin are splashed all over this disc, just check out the opening track. This is fine work, perhaps their best to date. I do not like to write long reviews, so as a summary of perhaps the finest english band of the last 15 years....put it in your cart now!!!
B0000CE742|5.0|This is the greatest hits with the same cover as the 2 other simpler versions. But don't let it fool you as this is an australian import which gets it right with a full 42 tracks in total. This is a must have with nearly 2 1/2 hours of music. Excellent value, pity it hasn't been noticed by too many people! Many songs including quite a few 70's tracks right up to the last album with 5 of its tracks on this cd from \\"living proof\\". Some quite rare songs on here to that not many people would have heard before, check it out!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|This rare and beautiful film, based on a book that is felt as much as read, transcends the medium to become art. Painted on a vast desert canvas with deep rich oils, its beauty is felt as much as seen. This film will find your heart and remain there forever. If love had a face, it would look like this.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella's screenplay shifts the center of Michael Ondaatje's story slightly in order to capture on film the essence of his beautiful prose. Ondaatje's novel is one of poetic beauty, a potrait of a rose beneath the water's surface. The film brings that beautiful rose out of the water and into the sunlight. The book and the film are so deeply intertwined you can not watch this film without wanting to read the book, nor can you read the book without wanting to see the film. The story itself centers around three people either in love with, or haunted by ghosts they have loved and lost to war.<br /><br />Juliette Binoche gives an Oscar winning performance as Hana, a kind nurse with a gentle spirit but a damaged heart. She latches onto the burned and charred body of a man known only as the English patient, and ends up caring for him in a shell ravaged Italian villa in Tuscany where she feeds him plums and reads to him. When a man named Caravaggio with scars of his own arrives, the mystery of who the English patient really is begins to unfold via flashbacks. In the present, Hana begins to let her heart heal when she falls in love with a Sikh who disarms bombs left by the Germans.<br /><br />It is the memories of the English patient, however, which are at the heart of this film. Ralph Fiennes gives a subtle performance as the introspective Almasy, part of an international expedition mapping an unending desert with both the romance, and the danger of the sea. Kristin Scott Thomas is wonderful as Katherine Clifton, the stunningly beautiful and enigmatic wife of a fellow mapper. An instant but unspoken attraction between she and Almasy finally becomes too unbearable to ignore and the affair that holds the key to the mystery surrounding the English patient begins.<br /><br />This is one of the most romantic films ever made and is filled with the joy and anguish of love and war. It shows that while war may create logistical lines that can not be crossed, the heart has no boundaries. Anyone who has ever experienced a love of such emotional intensity and physical longing that love and need became one will understand the love affair of Katherine and Almasy.<br /><br />Cinematographer John Seale has given this film a grace and beauty seldom seen on film. A haunting score full of mystery and romance from Gabriel Yard accompany scenes never to be forgotten, and will not be described here in case you have not yet seen them. Director Anthony Minghella explores the mystery of the desert, and the heart, which according to the \\"The Histories\\" by Herodotus, a book the English patient clings to, is an organ of fire.<br /><br />If there is but one ounce of romance in your soul, you will love \\"The English Patient.\\" It is a well charted and romantic map of the human heart, as wide and treacherous as the unending desert. This will be one of your favorite films once you see it. I promise.ignore and the affair that holds the key to the mystery surrounding the English patient begins.

B000091NON|3.0|David Lee Roth was gone for the album (Duh!, you already knew that) and Sammy Hagar was in. Although most people decry the vocalist change, it actually worked. Hagar is something of a chameleon; he's able to adapt to newer styles and era's without feeling as though he's selling out. And, hey, he was the same sought of sleazebag womaniser that the last guy was, that's gotta count for something! And what could be better than replacing one super-confident sleazebag with long blonde hair with another super-confident sleazebag with long blonde hair? Man! That almost sounds like a good idea... And hey, he'd been around since 1973 with Montrose, so he brings a lot of experience to the table, experience is a good thing, right? Well, usually. Though sometimes... like if you have 40 years experience under your belt, (literally?) well, you know... you must be kinda old...    Anyway, Hagar wasn't that old when he took over Van Halen, and for all the people saying that David should have stayed in the band, well, his star shone bright in 1986 with the extremely successful Eat Em and Smile, but his album sales soon fell away. Hagar was able to keep the Van Halen brand selling platinum right through to the mid-90's. SO There! But all that matters is the music right? Right! Well...    Hagar takes on the personality of rebel womanising sleazebag and plays it perfectly, but he tweaks it a bit, not too much, but a bit. He throws in some sanctimonious sap and some tear-jerking for good measure? Or is it bad measure? Well Van Halen had always avoided ballads, but actually the best songs on this album ARE the ballads.  Sure rockers like 'Get Up' and 'Can't get enough' are ok, but I mean they are quite mediocre. 'Summer Nights' is more fun and 'Best of both worlds' (A tranny anthem?) has a great groove (actually, it's kind of a rip off... I think the ole' disco tune by Kool and the Gang, Celebrate good times or something like.... YES! Van Halen ripped off a disco song). Man it's hard not to sing along to that infectious chorus, man I caught the bug or something... Then the title track is Hagar complaining about his girlfriend or wife or something, and it's not a lot of fun. But the ballads, well, you can call 'Why can't this be love' a ballad, it's not really, but, it's emotionally powerful, with a simple yet effective message 'it's got what it takes, so tell me Why Can't This Be Love?' and 'Dreams' is a mega power ballad, a beautiful intro with acoustic guitar playing along to some nice synths, and that powerful chorus with Sammy shrieking like a coyote 'Higher and Higher'; veyr uplifting song. And then my favourite song on the album 'Love walks in' which is sought of ethereal and fuses romantic lyrics with a UFO theme. Exquisite melody and a wonderful feeling in this song. The rockers on this album are ok, 'Best if both worlds' is especially enjoyable, but it's the ballads that'll keep you coming back.
B00005J6T0|3.0|19 years after hearing this album in its entirety I tried to do it again. I couldn't make it. The hits that were extracted from the album are great, specially Open your heart tough I never liked and still don't the hit Live To Tell. BUT all the rest of the songs are fillers at its best, I just couldn't stand listening to all that chessy stuff, those songs will certainly give you a headache or an attack for excessive consumption of SUGAR.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Having read the book, I was able to follow the [mangled] plot perfectly fine. <br /> <br />However, I feel terrible for people who missed key points in the story because of missing scenes. Such as: the makers of the Marauder's Map. When Lupin reveals that he does know it is a map, Harry never asks how he knows. Moony, Prongs, Padfoot, and Wormtail are never revealed as Remus, James, Sirius, and Peter. Also, Harry's patronus. Instead of a stag, it's a ball of light. You miss the point that Harry's patronus is in fact the animal form that his father could take on.  I'm again upset at the fact that quidditch was entirely erased from the movie except for that one game. You miss that Gryffindor finally won the cup and Oliver Wood's reaction! (But of course that would have meant putting the Firebolt scene in the CORRECT spot!) <br /> <br />Did anyone else also notice the mistake in the FIRST scene of the movie? Harry is not allowed to do magic outside of school, and yet we see the underage wizard performing a spell under the covers to read a book. What gets to me even more is the fact that later in the book, they repeat the fact that he's not allowed to do magic outside of school! Be consistent! <br /> <br />And what happened to the characters? Hermione... bushy haired! It was the one thing I loved about the first movie, her hair. Why is everyone wearing Muggle clothes? I miss the Wizards robes that in a school for Witches and Wizards are supposed to be, you know, mandatory. Why are they now wearing Muggle clothing, when in the last two movies (and all the books) they never wore Muggle clothing? I feel betrayed to see anyone at that school in jeans and a rainbow belt (Hermione wore a rainbow belt). And Malfoy... oh, I won't even get into that. <br /> <br />But I have to say, even with the omitted scenes, mangled plot, and changed characters, the ending was the absolute worst part of the entire film. No Quidditch Cup, no House Cup, and the scene with the Firebolt was absolutely terrible. Harry doesn't get the Hogsmeade permission form from Sirius in the movie, and Ron doesn't get Pig, his owl, from Sirius either. And does anyone else think that the last image (Harry's motion blurred up close face) is competely... well, ugly?  <br /> <br />The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I happened to love the dementors and Sirius Black.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|The music is fast, sexy, and vivacious, never knew violins could sound like this.  The entire CD is alive with wonderful music.
0790729989|5.0|This film is up there with Insomnia and Memento. It has everything needed for a good crime/detective film. I am barely starting to get into detective films as well as Mobster/Gangster films although this does not fall into those two categories. Seven is has a great cast, even though Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey have only a limited amount of screen time, their performences are still effective, especially Kevin Spacey's. Morgan Freeman did a wonderful job in this film as a the cool headed detective who is a true intellectual in this film, contrary to the hot headed Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt played his part well, in perfect contrast to his partner, of course this scenario has been seen before but that doesn't matter because Brad does true justice to his part of this duo. The ending was unexpected and suited Brad's character well, although I figured out from the begining that he was going to commit one of the seven \\"deadly\\" sins. The only problem I had, was that this DVD did not come with any extra features, especially commentaries which I would have liked. Great film.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This gentleman's voice is very mellow, and sexy.  The CD shows his vocal range at its best. Home is my favorite.
B000001AKM|5.0|Rewind 8 years: On my way to high school and BACK TO FRONT is playing on my mom car's stereo...Fast forward to present: and BACK TO FRONT is STILL playing, only this time on MY own CD player.  <br /> <br />This album is a definite classic!!! \\"Back to Front\\" only gets better each time you listen to it and will have you singing along in no time. Richie's lyrics are plain, simple and sincere; the kind men write to their partners and pass off as their own. His voice too is absolutely phenomenal. This is one of the few albums you listen through without skipping a single track. <br /> <br />Listen out for top songs like \\"My Destiny\\"(my personal favourite). <br /> <br />        From the first time that I saw you  <br />        I knew it was forever <br />        This mighty love between us <br />        Will keep us together <br />        You're the girl God sent from heaven <br />        I'm so glad I found you, Forever............Its lyrics tug at every last string....lovely lovELY, LOVELY!! <br /> <br />Other personal favourites include: <br />-\\"Stuck on you\\" - Doesn't seem to be on this version but it's definitely one of the better tracks. <br />-\\"Do it to me one more time\\"  <br />-\\"Three times a lady\\" <br />-\\"Running with the night\\" <br />I definitely 101% recommend this album to all classic R&B lovers out there. Perfect for a lie-in with that special person.. <br />
0689865384|5.0|This book is an extremely wonderful read!  It's inventive with betrayal, relationships, jealousy, action, adventure, and way more!  It's totally captivating and leaves you wanting to read the next books in the trilogy!  Scott Westerfeld is a genius for creating this whole new plot and world, that we can still relate to!  All I have to say is Wow!  And there's a lot of surprises throughout the book!  I recommend it for everyone of all ages!
B00005R62K|5.0|Wow, two reviews in two days, you'd think I'd have nothing better to do (actually today I don't)! Anyway, 'Stained Class' released in the Spring of 1978 was far and away the most original heavy metal issued to that date. Priest had a fully matured sound that was up to this point not affected by commerciallity and could actually be called a state of the art metal band (this would change unfortunately). \\"Exciter\\" opens the record and is instanly a classic, the birth of speed metal (along with \\"Call for the Priest\\" from 'SAS')with the double bass drums and liquid metal lead guitars! \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" is the second most famous song and another landmark, would Metallica have done \\"Fade to Black\\" if Priest hadn't written this song! Two very distinct guitar breaks, Tipton's blues based masterpiece and Downing's lightning strike demolition, flawless! Other highlights include the title cut (another speed metal classic), \\"Heroes End\\" (\\"and so the living dead, carry on immortal deeds\\"), \\"Better By You Better Than Me\\" (that stupid lawsuit, only in religious right conservative America!!!!)and \\"White Heat, Red Hot\\", could Halford's voice be more unbelievable!!!! I'm not particularly impressed with \\"Invader\\", never liked it (dumb) but I guess Priest had to show they could be mere mortals sometimes. New man Les Binks proofs to be an adequate successor to Simon Philips, especially during \\"Exciter\\". 'Stained Class' is a rock classic because it is pure heavy metal but will never get its mainstream due or airplay. Who cares, music like this is critic proof anyway. Brief note on bonus tracks, live \\"Better\\" is OK, studio track \\"Fire\\" is lame!! It is also obviously from the '85-'86 recording sessions that produced a plethora of these stupid bonus cuts, hard to believe that the same band who produced a work of sheer genius like 'Stained Class' also did dreck like 'Turbo' and 'Ram it Down', but there's the proof.

B00005JNTX|2.0|The film is all about style.  It is a comic book brought to life.<br /><br />At first I was intrigued.  The characters are larger than life and the plot is about the hero trying to find the killer of a woman with whom he spent one romantic night.<br /><br />The film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point.  Blood is always red.  And so is lipstick.  Eyes are green or blue.  And there really is a yellow bastard.  The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.<br /><br />However, Sin City lacked one important thing - a story I could get my teeth into.  The special effects and style overshadowed everything.  And I was left wondering what all this was about.  I watched this film for over an hour, hoping that it would make some sense.  Finally I fell asleep.<br /><br />Perhaps this film would be interesting to film students.  It certainly is a departure from the norm.  But I need more than experimental techniques to hold my interest.  I need a good story.
B00005JNEI|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie documentary that was written, produced, and directed by Michael Moore looks at the role played by money and oil after the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  The majority of the movie contains archival news footage with Moore narrating but there are some interviews.  This is balanced with Moore's own brand of humor and satire.<br /><br />It's title comes from the 1953 novel entitled \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" that depicts a society where independent thinking is discouraged and books are burned.  (451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that's needed for paper to burn.)<br /><br />This movie was written and released just before George W. Bush's re-election in 2004 as president of the United States.<br /><br />The end credits of this documentary reveal who it is dedicated too:<br /><br />\\"This film is dedicated to...all the soldiers from the Flint [Michigan] area who have died in the Iraq war...the 2,973 who died on 9/11/01 and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our [that is, the American government's] actions.\\"<br /><br />As a very brief overview, this movie begins with the strange events that occurred during the 2000 election between Gore and Bush.  Then we hear and see the horrors of September 11, 2001 and the president's response to these horrors.  From here, the documentary tells and shows us key things with respect to the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war.  The movie ends with a \\"Congressional Recruitment\\" by Moore.<br /><br />Moore also has some candid interviews in the movie.  Most revealing is the interview with a serviceman that had recently returned from Iraq.  When asked if he'd return to Iraq if asked he said \\"No\\" even if this decision meant \\"possible jail time.\\"  His reason:<br /><br />\\"I will not let anyone send me back over there to kill other poor people [e]specially when they pose no threat to me and my country...I won't do it.\\"<br /><br />As I mentioned above, the majority of this documentary contains archival news footage, some of it graphic.

B00005JODA|4.0|Based on a novel by John Le Carre, this brand new film starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz just opened in theaters.<br /><br />Fiennes is cast as a rather conventional British diplomat who falls in love with the fiery Rachel Weisz.  In the first few minutes of the film they meet, mate, marry and go off to Africa where Fiennes is stationed.<br /><br />He'd rather tend his garden and keep a blind eye to the truths around him.  She adopts the humanitarian causes of the people and sometimes embarrasses Fiennes by telling off the stuffed shirt diplomats in his circle.  He adores her though and their relationship is hot even though it seems as she and an African doctor are having an affair.<br /><br />Everything is shattered when the African doctor and Rachel Weisz are brutally murdered.  That's when mild-mannered Fiennes gets involved in the investigation.  What he discovers is corruption at the highest level, involving big pharmaceutical companies who are using the Africans as guinea pigs to test new drugs.  Fiennes' investigation leads to more and more discoveries.  Eventually, his own life is in danger.<br /><br />The acting is excellent and so is the cinematography.  It really seemed to be the real Africa although the country remained unnamed. I do question the title because there was little about gardening in the film with the exception that it seemed that Fiennes would rather tend his garden than get involved in the horrible politics around him.  Then, of course, he couldn't stop himself.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and especially like the fact that it addressed some real issues in the world today.  It almost didn't matter that the details of the plot were a little confusing at times.  I wish it grabbed my emotions more though.  I know it was supposed to as it deals with the dire results of human greed and corruption.
630542828X|3.0|If taken as a work of fiction, this is a pretty good movie.  We have sympathetic victims, a hero lawyer (and the other wonderful people in his firm) (of course, anyone not receiving a settlement check might find the hero lawyer stretching things), and easy to hate \\"big corporations\\" and their sinister attorneys!  Sadly, this film is billed as based on truth.  Yes, there were people who may have suffered from poisoning through their water, although it remains unproven.  Most of us cannot accept the statistics of cancer and believe that it must always be \\"caused\\".  Still, not matter what you believe, you can search the web and verify that this movie's version of the facts is mostly made up.  You can draw your own conclusions as to why.<br /><br />Yes, the rich corporations were made to pay money for a cleanup.  However, that in no way proves their guilt scientifically, although there are legal proofs that have nothing whatever to do with reality.  Nevertheless, this is a compelling couple of hours if you can stop the reasoning part of your brain from asking a few key questions here and there.<br /><br />Luckily, the movie didn't make its money back, so its relative failure will dampen the making of these hero-lawyer / bad-company fictions that contribute to a general misperception of reality.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Based on a Robert B. Parker novel, \\"Stone Cold\\" is a made-for-TV film that is an excellent vehicle for Tom Selleck's talent. He plays Police Chief Jesse Stone, who lives in a small Massachusetts town, having left behind a broken marriage and a heavy drinking habit in Los Angeles. Both however are still in his life, as his wife continues to call, and his solace is in the bottle. Though the plot is about a series of killings, as well as the rape of a teenage girl, there is little that makes this film a \\"thriller,\\" as the leisurely pace and stoic demeanor of Stone dominate the story. He is intelligent and witty, and Selleck is perfect in the role. Selleck describes the film as being \\"...almost totally based on emotion, told through the eyes of a character who doesn't like to show any.\\"<br /><br />Others in the cast include Mimi Rogers, terrific as a seductive attorney, and Stephen McHattie as Captain Healy. Directed with a steady hand by Robert Harmon, it boasts a superb score by Jeff Beals, and some lovely cinematography by Rene Ohashi. Total running time is 87 minutes. DVD extras include \\"Beneath the Surface of \\"Stone Cold\\" Featurette,\\" with interviews of Selleck, Harmon and Rogers. Selleck speaks of plans for more of Jesse Stone in the future, which is a tremendous idea, as this film is excellent material for a series. The character of Stone is tough and complex, and immensely likeable as played by Selleck, who has come a long way since being the TV hunk of the 80's, and is a superb actor.
B00005JLWN|3.0|I don't understand people today and their acceptance of \\"fantasy\\" <br />action scenes in movies these days, I guess I prefer my fight scenes to be more realistic rather than the preposterous action scenes depicted that border on comedy.  So I'm taking the opposite view from the majority of reviewers here and say that the fight scenes detracted from the movie and will keep this from being taken seriously.  Which is a shame since the movie does manage does capture interest with a wonderful performance by Bale, and an interesting story.  Still I can't help but feel disappointed about how much better this movie could have been.
B00005V0X5|4.0|One day, before Metallica debuted in 1983, band members James Hatfield and Lars Ulrich confronted Dave Mustaine and fired him from the band (for alcohol problems and attitude conflicts). Dave would go on and form his own band, Megadeth, in 1984. Most don't consider Megadeth's debut, \\"Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good,\\" one of `Deth's all-time best, and even though it's not classic, it's a very decent and underrated album. Like Metallica's debut (\\"Kill `Em All\\"), \\"Killing Is My Business\\" isn't this band's most mature, catchiest, or best release, but it is amazingly fast. Tracks one and six, \\"Last Rites/Loved to Deth\\" and \\"Looking Down the Cross,\\" wisely break up the monotony. \\"Last Rites\\" begins softly with a piano, and \\"Looking Down the Cross\\" is half speed. But most of the guitar riffs fly by so fast that the listener can barely hear any notes; you just hear a speedy hurricane of guitars. Add a beeping bass and a drummer who does his best to keep up, and the result is an album which might be Megadeth's thrashiest. The title track is a famous song which helped define Dave Mustaine. It has a sprinting rhythm which goes up and down. Next, \\"The Skull Beneath the Skin\\" chugs fast, and \\"Rattlehead\\" has four very speedy guitar solos. (These solos vary in quality, but some of them--like the last one--are very good). Finally, \\"Mechanix\\" is a classic `Deth tune because it has some catchy singing. The bottom line is, since \\"Killing Is My Business...And Business is Good\\" was released in 1985, it was one of thrash's first C.D.'s, so I believe it's essential listening for metalheads.<br /><br />The original version of this C.D. was released two decades ago, the sound quality has inevitably dipped. Fortunately, Dave Mustaine remastered and reissued almost all of Megadeth's back catalogue, so this remastered version, released in 2002, sounds a heck of a lot better. It sounds about two times more clear and less rough, but it doesn't ever lose the intensity of the original. And the three demos at the end (of the remaster) are good inclusions in any collection.ginal. And the three demos at the end (of the remaster) are good inclusions in any collection.
B00008RH3L|3.0|There's one overriding element of Miller's Crossing which is readily apparent from the outset--snappy stylish dialogue that forces one to listen intently lest something is missed.  Quite the gimmick to hold one's attention.  If you're expecting to remain a mentally passive participant, fuhgedaboutit! There's one problem--the labyrinthine plot takes so many left turns and backsteps with a cast of equally unsavory characters that one is ultimately befuddled by it all and simply lets himself be \\"taken for a ride\\". <br /> <br />The time and place is prohibition era America in some large unnamed multi-ethnic city run by mobsters who have city government inextricably on the take.  From appearances, no one other than racketeers and crooked government officials inhabit this social milieu.  \\"Ordinary\\" citizens spend their time at the speakeasy run by top dog Leo (Albert Finney).  Oh, there's an anonymous boy and his dog who make an appearance hovering over the bloody backalley corpse of one \\"Rug\\" Daniels, a hired \\"tail\\" who's mysteriously \\"rubbed out\\" and a character who becomes central to the proceedings without ever uttering a single word.  The boy makes off with the dead man's toupee.  \\"They took his hair,\\" Leo later utters in astonishment, believing for all the world that the missing toupee carries some symbolic significance other than as the random event which it is.  Such is the closed, delusional, and self-involved world of these characters who inhabit it. <br /> <br />Doors to private residences aren't barriers to entry as much as they're \\"itches to scratch\\"; the residents themselves don't even bother to ask who's knocking before opening them, if people bother to knock at all.  Everyone seems to know everyone else's business; some private conversations almost instantaneously become public knowledge.  Ethics, at least as they're defined in this milieu, exist to propagate the aforementioned self-involved delusions.  Boss Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) implores to Leo, \\"What kind of a world is it when a businessman can't trust his own fix?\\"  <br /> <br />Seemingly above the fray is our protagonist Tommy Reagan (Gabriel Byrne), Leo's young street-smart confidant who gambles too much, but garners trust and grudging respect from everyone involved because he's \\"honorable\\" and knows all the angles. Despite his allegiances, people \\"like\\" him.  He rolls with the punches, literally, with the self-assured belief that it's better to pay one's own debts than to have them \\"taken care of\\" and that actions should only be taken \\"for a reason\\".  Tommy's love involvement with Verna (Marcia Gay Harden), the sister of neurotic underhanded bookie Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro), makes for severe complications because Verna also has her emotional \\"claws\\" sunk deep into Leo.  But Caspar wants Bernie Bernbaum \\"bumped off\\" from Leo's protection because Bernie's been broadcasting Caspar's fixes, thus \\"corrupting\\" the fixed odds. Leo denies this request seemingly out of pure spite for Caspar. Tommy entreats Leo to carefully weigh what can be gained by protecting Bernie with what can be lost by giving Caspar the \\"high hat\\".  Afterward, Tommy comes clean with Leo about his affair with Verna and gets \\"bounced\\", literally, from Leo's protection and confidence.  Tommy soon finds himself in the employ of Leo's nemesis Caspar, who earlier made Tommy a one-time-take-it-or-leave-your face-on-the-floor offer to cover his gambling debts if he'd deliver Bernie Bernbaum.  Meanwhile...aw, fuhgedaboutit!  Think I'm spoiling it for you?  Not a chance, that was just in the first hour! <br /> <br />Despite the convoluted machinations, Miller's Crossing shows inimitable cinematic style.  A marvelous scene has Leo in a one-against-all gunfight replete with acrobatic stunts straight out of a b-movie western and a standing tommy gun duel which has him looking like no less than George C. Scott as Patton standing tall with a pistol against a strafing Messerschmitt--all to the pensivestrains of Danny Boy on the phonograph.   <br /> <br />All the actors play their roles over-the-top and revel in their parodistically noirish dialogue, with perhaps the exception of Byrne as Tommy.  He gets to make up for it by wracking his brain in the midst of this underworld zoo and taking more physical punishment than is humanly possible in a lifetime of movies!  Think I'm exaggerating?  Well, this whole film is one large exaggeration.  In fact, it's closer to a live-action cartoon populated by caricatures than a true-life drama.  In response to the reviewers who've expressed dismay at what constitutes \\"honor\\" and \\"manhood\\" in this film; I'd put forth that every character, every motivation, and everything that transpires is ultimately meant to be laughed at and scorned in the manner of any black comedy.  To even begin to compare Miller's Crossing with a film such as The Godfather is ludicrous. <br /> <br />The question remains, should one take the time to view this film?  Absolutely.  Does it ultimately reward multiple viewings with the purpose of garnering lucid insights and further comprehending all that goes on and with whom?  Well, Caspar imparts the following wisdom, and we also see Leo practice it: \\"Always remember to put one in the brain.\\"  The overly assiduous viewer might do likewise to himself. I've forced myself to watch this film five times...trust me, a sixth time won't be in the immediate offing.

I know they had enough money to do more and put in alot more than they did.  The only reason why i gave it a 2 star is because of the one person,  Alfonso Cuaron  he has not even made one good movie and I know movies very well. The only movies he should do is home movies!  I just hope they dont cut alot out like the they did in part 3. Thanks for taking your time in reading this.

079073639X|5.0|Sphere is one of the few modern science fiction movies that's not really just another horror movie.  As an sf fan, I've been disappointed over and over when a movie advertised as sci-fi, about space or ocean exploration, turns out to be another knock-off of \\"It The Terror From Beyond Space.\\" (That was fine the first time, when the result was Alien).<br /><br />--Spoiler Alert--<br /><br />Sphere does take a turn in the Horror direction, but not far enough to disappoint me.  The premise is like \\"Galaxy Of Terror\\" under the sea.  It's about a team of scientists, including Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson, led by top secret Peter Coyote to investigate a spacecraft found under the ocean.  They quickly discover it's a spacecraft from Earth's future, apparently temporally displaced (dis-timed?) to Earth's past - but with a clearly alien artifact on board:  The sphere.  It seems the sphere enables or causes some of the team to manifest their fears in their undersea base.<br /><br />However, it remains closer to true sci-fi than pure horror.  The ideas have all been done, in classics like Forbidden Planet, where Dr. Morbius manifests the monster from his Id through alien technology, Voyage To The End Of The Universe, Galaxy Of Terror, and even the old pulp story \\"Time Wants A Skeleton\\" by Ross Rocklynne, and so on.  Here it's all arranged in a well-constructed plot, kept moving with fast action, kept believable by the competent actors.  And if you prefer Horror movies like Leviathan, the remake of The Thing, etc., you probably won't be dissapointed either.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Ok so its not as good as dookie but its still a good album. Ok its seriously over played and commercialised but come on people what more could they do. After dookie insomniac and nimrod (three very similar albums) green day couldn't just carry on doing the same thing they'd get no-where. The guitaring although it isn't great by billie joe its thought out. In insomniac (even though it was a good album) was just mindless guitar playing with lyrics which didn't really mean anything. The lyrics on this album are strange at times but they tell a story. With the backing guitaring of Jason White the band is now a great force in the rock world. Hay they won a grammy for christ sake that has to count for something. And so what if they want to make money its the least they desirve after all these years. Green day is taking the rock world to a new level without them you wouldn't have bands like weezer, good charlotte, sum 41, blink 182 ect. So give the guys a break. There a class band and this is a great album but I suggest you buy dookie first.
B00082IJ08|4.0|The fact that a cartoon simulated quartet can win over platinum sales is frickin' amazing.  I am a music-business enthusiast and subscriber to Billboard Magazine so I see how much each album sells each week.  I've notice that Gorillaz DEMON DAYS specifically has been a strong seller for the most part. I'd also heard first single \\"FEEL GOOD INC\\" and I was just curious to see what all the buzz about GORILLAZ was.  After listening to it, I could completely understand why everybody loved the album so much.<br /><br />What I think is the appeal of GORILLAZ is the fact that it is so different from your typical mix of alternative rock and alternative hip-hop.  The themality of GORILLAZ tunes is also different from the themes that you see for the most part in rock music and hip-hop music.  You don't hear rock artists for the most part asking \\"are we the last living souls\\".<br /><br />The production of DEMON DAYS is definitely an aquired taste with its spare, bass heavy feel. I think that subtlety is what gives DEMON DAYS the feel that it has. Also, the lead vocals are almost \\"folksy\\" in quality, giving the music a whole other timbre.  Just by listening and analyzing this album can you discover a whole other level of music and musicianship.  While it seems so simple after a first listen (I initially didn't like this album), it is so complex listening to it over and over again and the songs and sounds easily get stuck in your head, especially infectious, first breakthrough single \\"Feel Good\\".<br /><br />My favorite tracks include \\"Kids With Guns\\", \\"Dirty Harry\\", \\"Feel Good\\", and \\"November Has Come\\".  This is certainly an ambitious album as well as a unique listen.  This is easily a four star album, if not more, just for the simple fact that it is different from everything else in the music business. The more and more that I listen to this album and analyze it, the more and more that I like it as well as understand it.
0375815260|5.0|Forget Jonny Depp.  Forget Gene Wilder.  Come back to the one, the only, the original...  <br /> <br />In this delightful tale that will enchant adults and children alike, young Charlie is living a very meager existence when suddenly he wins a chance to visit the mysterious Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, where fantastic, magical things happen. <br /> <br />This story is entertaining in its own right, but is also a delightful, wickedly sharp commentary on child rearing and excess in modern society.
B0000057C5|5.0|This is my favorite Rammstein album. They are forceful and somewhat sinister sounding, a plus compared to Mutter and Reise, Reise which, although very good, are more conventional-rock sounding. What really sets this band apart though, is that they sing in German. It somehow sounds cooler in another language, and since I can't understand what they're saying I can really concentrate on the the music itself.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD is awesome.  Gives you all the number one hits of the Bealtles.  Great album to start your beatles collection.  I bought this album first, and now purcahsed all the others because of \\"Beatles One\\"
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Being something of a lover of jazz and light pop - a habit I picked up because of my love for figure skating, I found Michael Buble almost by accident a few short years ago. He was performing at BB Kings where by sheer good fortune I was taken for a fun evening with friends. His show was great and he was a dynamo. The thing that tipped the scales as far as I was concerned was his sincere love of the classics and a sense of timing unparralled. After his set he ventured into the audience and took the time to talk to many of us and he expressed such genuine appreciation that I was struck by his often humorous, but always humble comments and honesty. No prima donna attitude here. <br />On It's Time I can hear the growth he has made as a singer and the confidence shows. The control he now has over his vocals and range is  something to behold and quite likely the reason that each and every song he sings, he owns! <br />Tender at times while vibrant and strong at others - but always, always in full and total control - he's become a master of song. <br />Evidently this is also a David Foster production and showcases Foster's ability to get the best out of every instrument and arrangement. <br />Yes, this is nice work by a nice guy.......It's Time. <br />
0060594888|5.0|Frankly, I began to read this volume with some apprehension because by now I have become convinced that there are no shortcuts to gaining wisdom and that the journey to obtain it is very, very difficult. Also, I agree with Oliver Wendell Holmes who once observed, \\"I wouldn't give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity but I'd give my life for the simplicity on the far side of complexity.\\"<br /><br />Would Canfield's The Successful Principles simply be an expanded explanation of how to achieve success by consuming a bowl of chicken soup one spoonful at a time, by eating a whale one bite at a time, etc? No, it is not. On the contrary. Invoking the metaphor of a journey, Canfield offers a variation on the familiar aphorism, \\"If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.\\" With Jane Switzer, he provides a cohesive and comprehensive program for those who are determined to achieve ambitious objectives, not only in their careers but in all other areas of their lives. Now here's the variation: \\"If you don't know what you want, your efforts will have no focus...and inevitably fail.\\" People must first decide what they want, what they REALLY want.<br /><br />The material is carefully organized and developed within six separate but interdependent sections. Canfield recommends 64 \\"commitments\\" and I wholly agree that the first is absolutely essential: Take 100% responsibility for your life. Those unwilling and/or unable to make and then sustain that commitment really cannot achieve their ambitious objectives, whatever they may be. In the first section, \\"The Fundamentals of Success,\\" Canfield offers 24 of what he calls \\"building blocks.\\" He then proceeds to examine what must be done to \\"transform\\" one's self to achieve success while building a support system which consists of mutually beneficial relationships with others. In Section V, \\"Success and Money,\\" he offers specific suggestions with regard to the prudent but productive process by which to obtain and then increase net worth. (There are no head-snapping revelations in this section. Its greatest value lies in the clarity and simplicity with which Canfield discusses various strategies and tactics.) He concludes with what is really a game plan which each reader must formulate to apply the success principles already explained in the previous five sections. I especially appreciate the provision of all manner of free resources which are readily available to each reader. (Please see pages 437-440.) There is also a \\"Suggested Reading and Additional Resources for Success\\" section.<br /><br />While offering so much food for thought and (especially) for positive action, Canfield enhances its appeal with some \\"seasoning\\" provided by hundreds of quotations throughout the narrative. For example:<br /><br />\\"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex, overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and the starting on the first one.\\" (Mark Twain)<br /><br />\\"Every negative event contains within it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.\\" (Napoleon Hill)<br /><br />\\"If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.\\" (Andrew Carnegie)<br /><br />\\"Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\\" (Albert Einstein)<br /><br />\\"Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail.\\" (Charles F. Kettering)<br /><br />\\"Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.\\" (Abraham Lincoln)<br /><br />\\"It is not the will to win that matters -- everyone has that. It is the will to prepare to win that matters.\\" (Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant)<br /><br />\\"It's never crowded along the extra mile.\\" (Wayne Dyer)<br /><br />\\"You can get anything in life you want if you will just help other people get what they want.\\" (Zig Ziglar)<br /><br />However, all of the material in this book (including Canfield's) is essentially worthless unless and until a reader makes and then sustains a full commitment to assume 100% responsibility for her or his life...and then decides precisely what she or he REALLY wants to achieve.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Michael Ray's The Highest Goal, Jim O'Toole's Creating the Good Life, David Whyte's The Heart Aroused, and The Oz Principle co-authored by Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman.less unless and until a reader makes and then sustains a full commitment to assume 100% responsibility for her or his life...and then decides precisely what she or he REALLY wants to achieve.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Michael Ray's The Highest Goal, Jim O'Toole's Creating the Good Life, David Whyte's The Heart Aroused, and The Oz Principle co-authored by Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman.
B00005N915|3.0|Dispite the promise from the seller that the version he had was the unrated version, once it was received, it turned out to be the same \\"R\\" rated version everyone else had. I contacted him, and he said he would check his stock, since, as he said, if there are two versions available, he ALWAYS orders the \\"unrated\\" one.  As it turned out, his entire stock was the \\"R\\" rated version. He told me to keep the copy he sent \\"for my troubles\\", and would have a refund issued immediately...which he did. While I would still have preferd to have the \\"unrated\\" version of the movie, the \\"R\\" rated version is still QUITE good, and I would give it a fairly good recomendation to anyone interested in seeing Mickey Rourke in one of his more unusual, yet still very good, performances.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This CD rocks! The engineer work is very cool-- wish I coulda been a fly on the wall while they worked. (Ya never know what is real nowadays.) Seriously, I bought this CD twice-- the first one I had to throw out 'cuz I was afraid I'd get addicted to it. Well I'm addicted now! Love the lyrics, just wish they would have printed all of them (more info) in the booklet. Thank the Lord, finally quality music people NEED to buy!
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I hate it when people give D12 a million listens and then when they get sick of them, they start bragging. Say what you say, but Eminem does NOT steal the show and every rapper in D12 rock the stage with their different styles. I mean c'mon-let's face it-D12 are the most dominant rap group of history. If you don't believe me, go ahead and listen to possees like G-Unit, OutKast, The Black Eyed Peas & Chingy and then tell me there's better. I can honestley say there are no bad songs on this album (skits are quite pointless, though). And the quality isn't all that good, either. <br /> <br />01-GIT UP-5/5 (this is lyricism, baby) <br />02-LOYALTY-5/5 (one of the best tracks on the album and eminem isn't on it. see? there should b a bigger buzz over this song) <br />03-JUST LIKE-3/5 (now this song is pointless) <br />04-I'LL BE (FT. OBIE TRICE)-5/5 (just try to hate this one,man) <br />05-DUDE (skit)-stupid. a very long build up to \\"my band\\". <br />06-MY BAND-3.5/5 (just another commercial track) <br />07-U R THE 1-4/5 (good, but nothing special) <br />08-6 IN THE MORNING-4/5 (i dont care wat people say, but this isnt that good) <br />09-HOW COME-4.5/5 (u all know this one) <br />10-LEAVE DAT BOY ALONE-3.5 (just a good intro) <br />11-GET MY GUN-4.5/5 (classic D-Twizzy) <br />12-BIZARRE (skit)- (pleh!) <br />13-B1TC*-4/5 (means nothing) <br />14-STEVE'S COFFEE HOUSE (skit) (retarded) <br />15-D12 WORLD-4/5 (probably should have been the first song) <br />16-40 OZ.-5/5 (one of the best songs OF ALL TIME, goes down right next to Lose Yourself, I'm So Fly and N.Y State of Mind) <br />17-COMMERCIAL BREAK (skit) (im starting 2 feel that there are 2 many pointless skits) <br />18-AMERICAN PSYCHO II (FT.

I defeintly must say that these guys have gotten better and improved. I absoutly love this band. This album is a must have for System of a Down fans, or metal fans in general, it will not dissapoint you.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Fabulous.  Awesome.  Any word you can think of along these lines is fitting to describe this cd and artist.  Gavin DeGraw's Chariot is an album you can connect with.  You can sense the passion that goes into this music.  Gavin does lead vocals, and plays the piano and guitar creating a unique unclassifiable I like to call piano rock.  Whatever genre, it is a sound you are bound to love.  This cd is absolutely worth every penny and more.

B0009UC810|5.0|The Blues Brothers, Jake (John Belushi) and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd), are two beaten brothers who have been pushed to the edge of society where no one cares.  Life is a constant struggle, a position they have been all too familiar with for as long as they can remember.  They grew up at the Saint Helen Orphanage in the city of Chicago where the nuns provided them with the motherly upbringing of righteousness and properness.  Their fatherly role model lived in the basement, Curtis (Cab Calloway), who educated Jake and Elwood in the secrets of music and the other pleasures of life.  It would be accurate to say that Curtis had a stronger influence on them throughout their childhood.  In adulthood, Jake and Elwood still face adversity while trying to find their way back into the world.<br /><br />The film opens with a number of shots of the Joliet Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois. These shots provide a symbolical opening for a difficult beginning, as walls and barbwire from the prison overwhelm the audience.  This beginning could also be a visual allusion of Jake and Elwood's life, which could suggest that much has been withheld from them since childhood in regards to nurturing.  In addition, this is Jake's release day from the penitentiary due to good behavior, which also offers the notion of new beginnings.  Ironically, when Jake exits the prison his brother Elwood waits with a police car, as he has gotten rid of their car in a trade for a microphone. A deal that Jake appreciates, as they both live for music.<br /><br />The first thing that Elwood does when Jake is released from jail is to fulfill the promise that he made two years earlier to Sister Mary (Kathleen Freeman), which is to visit her at the Saint Helen Orphanage.  Unwillingly Jake follows his brother into the orphanage where they relive old memories of punishment and the eerie presence of an unknown power.  However, a pleasant encounter with Curtis makes the visit worthwhile, as the audience learns that they picked up the black suits, sunglasses, white shirt and black tie from their childhood role model, Curtis.  From their visit with both Sister Mary and Curtis they learn that the orphanage is about to be sold to the Board of Education, as a tax assessment on the orphanage has set the church back $5,000.<br /><br />Again, adversity appears, but this time it is not their struggle. The Blues Brothers have been given a second chance that requires altruism and righteousness in which they can redeem themselves.  Curtis encourages them to go to church, a specific church where they can meet Reverend Cleophus (James Brown).  In a musically powerful and amusing scene Reverend Cleophus delivers a message to Jake through a higher power that says, \\"The band.\\"  Together Jake and Elwood set out to ensemble their old band with which they intend to collect the $5,000 that the orphanage owes the county.<br /><br />John Landis directs a visually stunning and musically enchanting comedy that delivers a powerful message of redemption, self-sacrifice, and hope.  The breathtaking characterization by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd enhance the visual experience, as they set out on a mesmerizing 10-day tour to accumulate money for the orphanage, as they are forced to step into situations where unselfishness is needed.  The police, nazi's, and a crazed woman are on their heels among many others, but as Elwood first says, \\"They are not going to catch us. We are on a mission from god.\\"  This implies that nothing can stop them, and visually Landis creates an over the top car chase that goes into the history books that supports this notion.<br /><br />Ultimately, Blues Brothers will leave many viewers with bellyaching laughter, moving selflessness, and an unforgettable story.  What truly touches the audience besides the laughter, music, or the terrific adventure is the details in the film.  The details in the mise-en-scene help provide an authentic environment and an authentic struggle.  Unlikeso many other comedies, Blues Brothers does not try to live on simply situational comedy, but a deeper meaning and a more complex situation.  The cinematic experience is neatly tied together by Landis, which delivers a sincere comedy that warms the heart and brings people together through the struggle of blues..  Unlike so many other comedies, Blues Brothers does not try to live on simply situational comedy, but a deeper meaning and a more complex situation.  The cinematic experience is neatly tied together by Landis, which delivers a sincere comedy that warms the heart and brings people together through the struggle of blues.

B00005JN5X|3.0|This was a very interesting and entertaining movie. It could have used some subtitles when the French characters were on screen and the reason it lost 2 stars is because of a nauseating and unnecessary scene involving a cat. I won't go into detail about that so as not to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but it didn't add anything to the plot and should've been left on the cutting room floor. Still, this movie was alright and a good way to spend a few hrs of your time.
B0009AM5JA|3.0|If Coldplay is generation Y's U2, that would mean \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is its Joshua Tree.  In turn that would mean that the next list of albums will turn out to be minor disapointments.  It may also mean that due to Gen Y's short attention span, Coldplay will not last nearly as long, and have fewer good albums.  It really is too bad, as they have taken over the artsy british rock crown from Radiohead.<BR>Now, there are two kinds of fans who will buy this album.  Those who want to listen to Coldplay, and Chris Martin lovers.  I myself am a coldplay lover.  Don't get me wrong, Chris Martin is the perfect vocalist for this band and without his piano work Coldplay wouldn't be what it is today.  But the problem with this album is the focus is drifting too much on Chris Martin and not the music.  Sure, its good for business to have a sex symbol being the main focus of a band, but the art will struggle because of it.  Before, in Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head, there was a perfect balance between Coldplay and Chris Martin, between the Music and the Man.  Now that balance has completely gone askew.  It shows in the slower songs that a certain pretentiousness is arising, and a naivity that is far more blatant than before.  I guess the thing that really bothers me is Chris Martin singing without any music, which to me seems silly, and very self-important in contrast to a good supporting cast.<BR>3 stars, however, is not enough.  I wanted to give it 3 1/2, but 4 would have been pushing it.  Some of the music has amazing flows.  The drumming is solid, and the guitar distortions are exceptionally effective.  The lyrics, are very hit and miss.  Some of them, are simply stunning.  Others are extremely naive, or even pompous. The best songs, the music flows pleasantly, and  works surprisingly well.  If every song followed a similar logic, this album would be stunning, but it would also be harder for singles to be released.  Again, good for business, but bad for art.<BR>1. Square One: 4/5 One of the better songs on this album, it starts off well, has some good parts, but the ending is almost spoiled by shoddy and naive lyrics.<BR>2. What if:    3/5 Very inconsistent in terms of both instrumentals, and flow.  A bad introduction, with occasional parts of brilliance.  Unorganized, flawed, and naive, with promise however.<BR>3. White Shadows: 5/5.  The best song on this album, amazing use of distortions, back-up vocals, and overall instrumentation.  This is another perfect balance between Coldplay and Chris.  Lyrics are boarderline strong, and some of them are very well done.<BR>4. Fix you:    2/5.  Allright, i dont watch the OC.  This is the worst song on the CD, and released as a single.  The opening is simply cheesy, as are the lyrics.  This is sadly the new direction of Coldplay, or should i say Chris Martin.  Even the vocals at the beginning, the vocals are strangely poor.  This song is almost completely done by chris, at least the 1st 1/2.  It does finally pick up about 2 mins in, which is far too long.  If you are a coldplay fan, fear this if it is the future(Think of the last several U2 albums).  When the group sings together it is unnecessary and doesnt really add to this song, it just sounds cheesy.<BR>5. Talk  3.5/5.  A better song on this album, is very inconsistent.  The lyrics aren't that great, and there are sections that are poorly done.  But the chorus is somewhat well constructed and has instances of being enjoyable, even some of the lyrics are great, but overall mediocre.<BR>6. X&Y   3.5/5 Another poor introduction, but this song does in fact get better.  The rhythm is simple, but effective.  Lyrics, again mediocre.  Good guitar work, and drumming is flawless.<BR>7. Speed of Sound:  4/5.  This single released from the album is good, the only thing preventing itself from being amazing is the fact that at parts it is nearly identical to clocks.  Amazing guitar distortions, and the bass gives a good heartbeat to the song.  Above average lyrics, and a good balance between focus on the band and chris martin, at least relatively.  I think maybe the piano, though good could have been toned down a bit.<BR>8. A Message:  4/5.  A newer version of sparks, but there is nothing wrong with that.  At least the music doesnt suffer. As for chris martin this is a good use of his talents, and his band backing him up.<BR>9. Low  : 4.5/5.  One of the far better songs on this CD.  The lyrics are above average.  The riffs are basic, but good nonetheless.  Perhaps what is so good about Chris Martin is that the lines between his singing and talking are very blurred.  He has a very good voice, he can raise an octave without any noticeable difference, seemingly completely calm, talk-singing, and then belt out a high pitched sound with great flow.  It can also come down with equal fluidity.  This song showcases it, but not at the expense of the band.<BR>10. The Hardest Part: 3.5/5, I don't have any significant complaints, of things that havent allready been heard.  It has good flow, and balance.  I love the guitar about 1:20 into it.  But at the same time, it is nothing special, and as far as coldplay goes, its not up with their other music.<BR>11.  Swallowed in the Sea: 4/5.  Allthough it is guilty of the general complaint i had about this album, the lyrics are stunning.  The sounds backing up chris' voice, create a mystical fairy tale feel to it.  The band slowly comes back into it, first guitarist then bassist and drummer.  The pace gets faster, which works.<BR>12.  Twisted Logic 3.5/5.  Still guilty of the main complaint.  But instrumentally becomes something much more.  Perhaps you can see what i mean in my major complaint.  With a strong instrumental, why do we need to hear Chris Martin sing by himself?  Why should the spotlight solely be on him?  It just seems silly.  Now here him with his band, isnt it so much better?<BR>13.  Kingdom Come: 5/5.  Another song i like.  It is a very good ballad,lyrically it is very good, and musically very well written.  Nothing spectacular, but very well put together instrumentally.  It is simply effective, that is why it is so good.  The album could not have closed on a better song, kind of unorthodox for coldplay but that does not matter.<BR>I know, i may get a lot of responses, and that this will be a very controversial.  If you are a coldplay lover, not a chris martin lover, then listen to my review after hearing the entire CD for a while.  The overall flow of the CD is marred slightly by some of its poor songs, but a good effort, not just what i expected after Rush of Blood to the head.
0064407667|5.0|My younger sibilings started reading this series and I didn't think it looked that great. When I finally decided to start reading it, I couldn't put it down. Much of the humor in this book is not written for children at all. And as the story progresses, it keeps getting harder to wonder what is going to happen next. The story and the humor are great! Everyone should read this series!
B00001ODGR|4.0|Musically, this is a must-have for any Styx fan.  But if you were wondering why few people can stand Dennis DeYoung, this video explains it perfectly.  Between the pointless \\"reunion\\" group shot near the start of the show (DeYoung: \\"Did you ever think you'd see these bums back together again?\\" -- during which the audience stops applauding, and the four of them are left just standing there -- creating a horribly awkward moment), to his air guitar and air punching, to his performace which is at times ridiculously melodramatic, to actually telling the audience at the end of the show that they had a good time (gag), he's often unbearable to watch.  Buy the DVD and edit around the ego displays.
6303122647|5.0|I Think This Movie Is Pefect For The Entire Family. It's Just So Awesome. And It's Also Colorful Too. I Rented It Before. And I Was Just Blown Away By It. And I Even Annoy My Friends By Singing Along To The Songs On The Movie. And I Even Watched It On HBO With Some Of My Friends. And They Liked It. So I Want Everyone To Buy This Movie. It's A Must Have For Any Movie Collection.
B00000163G|5.0|This is one of the most classic Hip Hop albums to be released.  Tupac's last album Me Against the World, which was released while he was in jail, was a very heart felt and serious album.  I really enjoy that album, however this one is definitly more commercial and a lot more successful.  As soon as Death Row bailed him out of jail, Tupac began recording for All Eyez on Me.      The album consists of two discs and Book 1 is defintely loaded with all the hits.  Ambitzions as a Rider is one of favorite tupac songs, somehow it didnt make it on the greatest hits disc though.  Nate Dogg makes an appearance in All About you and Scandalouz.  Got my mind made up is a weaker song with Method Man but its follow up How Do you Want it is one of the most classic party songs you can find.  Other highlights include 2 of Amerikaz most Wanted, Hearts of Men, Life Goes on, Only God Can Judge Me, California Love (not for some reason only the remix version is present here), and I aint Mad at cha.  Life Goes On is a really heart felt song about one of his homie dieing.  The final result is book with 7 songs from the greatest hits album.  I still think one of my favorite Tupac songs is 2 of Amerikaz most wanted where both Snoop and Pac were in their prime.  This disc alone is worth the purchase of the double album.    As mentioned before Book 2 is definitely the weaker of the two, hits wise, however there still are some real good cuts on here and its still better than what most other artists are putting out.  Can't See Me is a great song with a Dre beat, this one should have made it on greatest hits but there were already so many songs from this double disc on it!  I also really like Shorty Wanna Be a Thug, Holla at Me, Wonder Why they Call you Bitch.  All these songs feature only 2pac and no guests and they are real good.  After these songs however, most of the rest feature guests and collborations, which bring down Pac a bit because the other rappers arent as strong.  Picture Me Rollinis an instant classic and the guests on here help the song out.  My favorite song on this disc is probably the title track All Eyez on Me. THe beat is really good and the lyrics are true.  This defines what tupac was doing and feeling after he got out of jail.  Another good song on here is the last track Heaven Aint Hard to Find.  The others are decent and certainly dont need to be skipped, just they arent as strong.      Overall this album is a classic and with at least 15 awesome songs you cant go wrong with this purchase.  Some reviewers are comparing this album with Life After Death and it's just not needed.  Both albums are classics and different.  I love them both and am sad that these great rappers had to pass.  Tupac made only one more album after this (at least that he was aware of...) so grap this one because its a classic.  Great place to start your collection
B000063JDE|5.0|This is a love-it or hate-it film.  Its a classic and a masterpiece to be remembered for its role in the evolution of film.  Director and writer Lynch juxtaposes a white-picket-fence idyllic small town against the darkest of the freaky drug-addicted criminals.  Kyle MacLachlan plays Jeffrey, the decent young man the audience can identify with, while Dennis Hopper perfectly protrays an emotionally disturbed on-the-edge criminal.  The Isabella Rosselini character is stuck between the two worlds, desperately trying to stay mainstream but stuck with ties to the sadistic on-the-edge criminals.<br /><br />The dark crime side of this movie is downright scary, not necessarily for any blood and guts, but because you know these people are off their rocker and can snap at any minute.  Seeing the sexually ambiguous Ben (Dean Stockwell) sing a candy pop song in a dark den of gangstgers, loose women, guns, and drugs is truly startling.  Lynch repeatedly pairs the goody-good with the downright evil for sharp contrast and a lasting effect.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not a fan of this movie, or of Lynch as a director, but I enjoyed the film for what it is, and there is an audience out there for these types of surreal flicks.  It is a must-see if you are going through all the classics.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This is junk, derivative, vacant and one dimensional.  It is like something completely created by P.R. people using a lot of hype, black mascara and some rebellious, sensational lyrics that sound as inane as Babs Streisand and her lame and unoriginal \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" although different musical genre. This Greenday fare is not music. Yes, let's be different and hate Americans...how cool...how trendy...how blah, stupic and boring.  Buy this robot music if you want to waste your money.
B0002YLC24|4.0|Before Sunset, with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, makes for a great sequel to Before Sunrise, an earlier movie starring the same two actors. Basically, Before Sunrise chronicles the one-night adventures of two young people who happen upon one another while traveling in Europe. The couple enjoy a wonderful evening, and they make plans to meet each other again. The movie ends without explaining whether the two ever did meet up again.<br /><br />In Before Sunset, nine years have passed, and the two people run into each other at a Paris book shop. Their conversations start up again, and they decide to spend some time together before Jesse (Hawke) must catch a plane back to the United States.<br /><br />While I didn't find the movie earth-shattering or anything, I thought Delpy turned in a GREAT performance. She had a very natural style of delivery in this film. I wonder how much of the dialogue was scripted and how much was ad-libbed . . . ? It was a short movie, which I also thought was a good choice. (There's only so much of characters chit chatting while they leg it around Europe that one can take.) Although the ending did have some ambiguity to it, there was enough resolution there for viewers to feel closure.
0140557741|5.0|I don't want to give too much away but the artist in this book without words shakes up notions of perspective and reality. An interesting book on many levels. Is often used for motivation for executives and others as a lesson in how to view things. Highly recommended.
0767818040|5.0|This movie I consider to be akin to 'Vertigo' by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire. <br />He slams the porn industry in some very funny ways. You will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes. <br />What I liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end. I don't want to give away too much here, but a clever use of 'Hollywood Hijinks' and the line 'Don't believe everything you see' fit with the story very well. <br />'Postcards from the edge' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be. In this film, DePalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be. <br />As in 'Dressed to Kill', DePalma relies on non-verbal acting to carry the story, and quite successfully too. The scene begins when Craig Wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he's been watching though a telescope. The scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach. I believe it's about 20 minutes. Played out well with body language and facial expressions, this scene couldn't work any other way. <br />Like 'Vertigo', this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat. Maybe too much detail, not sure. I found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to continue.Not many movies attempt this slower approach, or do it in a way that makes it work. <br />All in all, definitely a must see. Keep in mind, the action is a bit slow at times. <br />Melanie Griffith appears here and does a great job in her role, as do the other actors. Filming, camera angels and use of props all work well. The plot is complex. This is a must see for suspense/murder mystery fans.
B0001NIUWG|2.0|It's surprising that I even gave this two stars without it having even a tiny snippet of Queen music.  While I am a huge Queen fan, I  would be embarrassed watching it with someone who did not know what they sound like. But with that said, there were some positives to be found in this somewhat odd documentary. <br /> <br />I was very impressed with the time spent discussing the previous endeavors of the band members (love that baby picture of Freddie Mercury).  Good interviews with their ex-bandmates as well.  But when the focus turned to Queen, I think it fell apart at the seams.  It moved too quickly through the band's later albums.  The biggest problem, however, is it became more of a biography on Freddie Mercury.  It was all Freddie this, Freddie that, etc., etc.   Rather than talk about one of their biggest albums, \\"The Game\\", the documentary chose to talk about how Freddie changed his image at the time of the album.   In fact, at that point in the documentary, you would be hard pressed to gain an iota of information on any of the other band members.  John Deacon, who wrote a #1 song for them in the 1980's (\\"Another One Bites the Dust\\") was barely mentioned in the entire documentary.  <br /> <br />I would have really liked to have learned more about the other members of the band.  After all, the documentary starts out by saying that each member was very integral to the success of Queen.  But you would never know that from watching this documentary.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Although some criticize Steal This Album as one of SOAD's worst, I think it is very good. Not as good as their first CD, but still an amazing album. If i could've given it 4.5 stars I would have, but seeing as I can't, it deserves a 5.  <br />In order, from System's best to worst, the albums go: <br />SOAD <br />Steal This Album <br />Toxicity <br />Mesmerize <br /> <br />On this CD, John Dolmayan's drumming is at it's very best, Serj's vocals remain brilliant, Shavo as a bassist keeps his touch, and Daron Malakian's guitar playing, although not to some's taste, booms out of the speakers with such incredible force into my ears that I can't help but love it's raw power. Not to say that System are always heavy, though. Roulette, one of their only fully mellow songs, is amongst the very best on the album.  <br />Tracklist: <br /> <br />Chik N Stu- 3/5: A moderately good song, but a bit tasteless melody-wise. Good vocals.  <br />Innervision- 5/5: The first of many amazing songs on the album. Deep and powerful riff.  <br />Bubbles- 4/5: A great song, but not amongst my favourites. Fast and quite heavy.  <br />Boom- 5/5: The most political and meaningful song on the album, with an awesome speaking verse and a heavy chanting chorus.  <br />Nuguns- 4/5: Great chorus, the verses are okay. Good tune.  <br />A.D.D.- 5/5: One of the heaviest songs on the album, another political one. My personal favourite. Superb one-note riff.  <br />Mr Jack- 5/5: A song about a paedophile. The first bit is haunting and quiet, but it descends slowly into slamming powerchords and screeching vocals from Serj and Daron.  <br />IEAIAIO- 5/5: Babblingly fast verses, (though not as fast as \\"Revenga\\" from Mezmerize) and a great chanting chorus with a crashing drum rhythm. The build-up part where Serj spews nonsensical statements is great.  <br />36- 2/5: It would be better if they turned it into a full length song, rather than a 46 second filler. <br />Pictures- 4/5: I absolutely loved this song whenI first got the album, but it wears off. I still listen to it, just for the chicken call.  <br />Highway Song- 5/5: Deep and melodical, with a brilliant drum beat. It rapidly changes from loud and heavy to soft and haunting.  <br />F**k the System- 5/5: Just because it makes me laugh. Oh yeah, and because I love the guitar line.  <br />Ego Brain- 5/5: A quiet and happy song that lightens up the mood of the album slightly in constrast to gloomy tracks like Mr Jack and Highway Song. It has a catchy yet slow tune.  <br />Thetawaves- 1/5: Possibly the only song on the album I REALLY don't like. It's just not my style, it's a bit boring and similar to other songs, and the verses are rubbish. It ends MUCH too abruptly. <br />Roulette- 5/5: The only song on the album which is mellow whole way through. It is a great, soft acoustic riff and light lyrics that Serj croons brilliantly without ending up whining.  <br />Streamline- 5/5: I don't know why, but I think of this song as slightly like Ego Brain, excpt longer and more of a climax to the album. The lyrics are deep and powerful, while the mellow bits make sure it doesn't go over the top. A great ending to a great album.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0385338686|4.0|I am a huge fan of the chick-lit books and this one is no exception!!!  <br /> <br />It is an easy read with lots of out-loud laughs that will lighten your mood and have you cheering for Samantha while she finds out for herself that happiness can often find you in the most unlikely of places. <br /> <br />A book and an author that is not to be missed. <br /> <br />

0224071262|5.0|MAO:   THE TRUE STORY ?      IS IT THE TRUTH  ?    As great historians know, one does have any full and complete perspective on what happened till 25, 50, 100 years later.      We can see the past but cannot see the future.  The People's Republic was declared in 1949.   From the years of 1949 to 1976, Mao was the de-facto dictator.      Of the three (3) brutal evil killers-dictators of the 20th. century, Mao's so-called Communist Party is the only Party Still in Power.  Hilter died in his bunker in 1945.      Germany is now a full, multi-party democracy.   The Nazis are no longer in power in Germany.      The Soviet Union lasted from 1917 to 1991.  The Soviet Union is now the Russian Federation.  President Putin was elected by 70% of the Russian population.  We can safely say Germany and Russia are no longer under a evil dictatorship.    What about China?  The Party that won the Civil War in 1949 is still in power.  It may have abandoned ideological communism, but nonetheless, China is still ruled by a evil one-party dictatorial government.      As we can tell, there has never been an election in China in the 18th, 19th. 20th. 21st. century.  How did China become a dictatorship?  How did millions starved to death, torture, chaos,  during the Communist rule.      To say whether this book paints a TRUE, ACCURATE, CORRECT, FACT-BASED, EVIDENCE-BASED  picture of the great evil dictator should be left to the professional historians, to the Chinese people themselves.       A professional historians I am not.  This book does, however, make incredible claims to truth, changes to the official history.   Many of us are not qualified to pass on the true-false nature of the book.  However, the book is a result of 10 years, full access to Russian archives, heavily foot-noted and one of the authors is a professional historians.     Is this a  TRUE, REAL picture of the evil dictator.  Are the claims exaggerated in the book.   What we need from the Chinese government is complete and open access to the archives so the Chinese and the world can find the truth about this evil dictator and the dictatorship he established.      All I can say to those who gave 1 star and bad-reviews to this book.  Remember China in 2005, in it's capitol has a dead body-corpse on display.      China is a one-party evil dictatorship and the Communist still rule in his name.    We need to know one thing and one thing about Mao:    THE TRUTH.  TRUTH.  TRUTH.  TRUTH.  TRUTH. TRUTH.  TRUTH.
0393317552|5.0|Sometimes certain concepts have to be delivered in several ways (i.e. verbally, written, visually) before they are grasped.    Diamond demonstrated quite clearly in his PBS special how the soil and structure of New Guinea (i.e.   soil quality, uneven terrain levels) was unfriendly to domestication, and that animals were extremely hard to domesticate (there were no large mammals for intensive labor, for example), a lack of durable textile for building etc--and on the whole very little protein.  In fact, he underscores protein in the diet as being a huge contributor to cultural advancement.  It has nothing to do with landscapes that look like paradise and produce a lot of mangoes and bananas.  It takes a lot more than fruit and nuts to build a society--and that is precisely his point.      As for all the religious and cultural variables--they don't even happen without a basic foundation.  Judeo-Christianity emerged in a breadbasket culture and is a product of agricultural society.  It evolved as it traveled Westward to more sustainable lands.      Read Collapse, if Guns doesn't convince you.  Even Europeans have failed in certain historical instances for not adapting to environment...and humans stand to fail in the future if we don't start honestly exploring sustainability in our respective environments.    ANd a big PS here:  I am not a leftwinger PC type.  In fact, I admire Diamond for being a reasonable type who understands the need for striking a balance between big business and ecological concerns.   He is probably one of the sanest thinkers out there.   I have tremendous respect for him as a compassionate person and a great thinker.
B000002KO1|5.0|this is the prentenders at their very best, at their very punkiest. this is high octane pretenders with honeyman scott and petey. of course, chrissie is smoking on this album as well. there are the hits on here as well, like kid and brass. however, the real meat of the album is with the darker and faster tracks like up the neck and precious. the pretenders have always been a great band and have strung together a solid career as hit makers. but this one is spe-cial, spe-cial, so spe-cial.

0894803123|5.0|This is my favorite Ice Cream book so far! Imagine the cartons of Ben and Jerry's ice cream art on the pages on this book! Bright, colorful, cute, cozy and funny! <br /> <br />The book starts off with the general history of how the guys came together to bring us what we today know as Ben and Jerry's ice cream. <br /> <br />They give you a few easy ice cream bases to follow, giving you a choice of how creamy and rich you want it to a less filling and figure friendly versions.  <br /> <br />Ok, here's the best part; you can make most of the recipes using one of the base recipes, and then pick your favorite page, and drop designated ingredients in. It gives me a great opportunity to customize their crazy concoctions! <br /> <br />Tonight I made two recipes from the book, pumpkin ice cream and plum ice cream, but managed to change them easy into Pumpkin with toasted Hazelnuts and Plum, walnut and shaved chocolate ice cream. Their recipes are fool proof, fun and come out fantastic. Besides you can add whatever combinations your heart desires, you won't find that option at any store! <br /> <br />Some of my favorite recipes from the book are; pumpkin ice cream, plum, kiwi, Banana fudge chunk, strawberry coconut, Fresh coffee, Maple walnut, cantaloupe and many more I can't wait to try out. In the end sections they also have recipes for sorbets, cookies, brownies and sauces, with ideas how to arrange the whole thing into a mouth watering creation.  <br /> <br />Great book, not expensive and trust me, looking at the recipes will get you into that kitchen weather you have an ice cream maker or not!
B00004R7TP|5.0|This album is a classic, for all the reasons said so well in the reviews below.    I just want to add another reading of Side Two, \\"The Ninth Wave.\\" Reviews below keep talking about a \\"drowning woman.\\"  There's a lot more going on.  I believe \\"The Ninth Wave\\" is the journey of a woman's suicide attempt, insights gained during recovery, and ultimate reclamation of life.      First she longs to just let go, to be weak and sleep forever... this is seductive to her, she overdoses....    Then feels the dark horror of regret as she goes cold and goes under...    Wakes up in hospital semi-conscious, hallucinating, struggling between life and death...    Is shown a vision of her loved one(s) trying to go on living without her...    Is visited by the future older woman she is meant to become; this woman denounces the attempted murder of \\"my part of your life\\"...    Has a transcendent experience that beckons her to truly come home to this life...    And ends the journey in gratitude for \\"the sweet morning fog\\", the beauty and joy of being alive, the presence of loved ones.    I realize that's a long-winded explication... but I swear it's all in there.  Listen again.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I'll admit, when I first heard Speed of Sound, I wasn't impressed.  It's a great song, but when you factor it to songs like Trouble, and Clocks, it's somewhat lacking.  But when I listened to the rest of the Album, it definitely became one of my favorite albums.  From the slow and hauntingly creepy Twisted Logic, to the quick and smooth White Shadows, X&Y has something for everyone.  Provided you like Coldplay in the first place.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|If you like prog rock and have never heard Dream Theater, I really suggest that you pick up this album. I would recommend any of their stuff but that would be presumptuous at this point since all I have heard is Octavarium. I've heard enough to be thoroughly convinced that this is a top-rate A+ prog band. I'll be trying out some more DT discs as the opportunity 'affords'. The thing that strikes me most is the entire spectrum of sound that is portrayed from the opening cut through the final title song (24 minutes BTW).  There is an interesting song called Sacrificed Sons that is about the 9/11 terrorist attacks and contains radio broadcasts that lead into the music and provide an interesting backdrop. I'm very impressed by the creative expression of this band. The singing is excellent and I suspect that there is more than James LaBrie singing here since some of the vocals sound very different. (kind of like hearing Iron Maiden and Parsons/Floyd vocals from one song to the next). I Walk Beside You does sound like U2 vocals but there is no way that U2 could do this song this well (And I like U2). It IS a very accessible song and should appeal to many and serve to turn more new people on to DT's music. As I'm reading reviews of this album I've noticed some negative reviews of this CD. I think that maybe they resent a good radio song like I Walk Beside You JUST because it's more commercial sounding and not quite so complicated musically. You know what? This is an extremely versatile band with a very diverse sonic quality. If their other CD's are near this good or better, then maybe some of those bad reviewers are just so used to hearing great musicianship that they've developed a kind of 'tolerance' to the music. This CD is dynamic. I really ENJOY listening to it. I wish more bands had musicians that are this accomplished. The concepts and lyrical songwriting are also very imaginitive and compelling. If you're curious...try it. Chances are it's better than a lot of musicin your collection.

B00005JMJG|5.0|I personally love this movie and I have read through many of the reviews shown here. A majority of the poor ones are based on the fact that the viewer was confused by the movie, and just wanted the plot spoon-fed into their lazy minds. I watched this movie, and when I was all done, I UNDERSTOOD IT! Amazing! I guess this isn't for people who don't enjoy exercising their minds. Other than the \\"confusing\\" plot, people based their reviews on the biased disliking of Jim Carry as an actor, and the disliking of \\"Artsy\\" movies. The film was definitely  a work of art, but not in the sense that it was SO abstract that only \\"Artsy Fartsy\\" people would claim to understand it. Also, the claim that the characters were unrealistic, is ridiculous. I've met people like Joel. Unsocial, lonely, middle-aged guy who are no stranger to failing relationships, and people like Clementine. Strung out and depressed girls, with wavering hormone levels that invoke the devil in them, who are just looking for an outlet to express themselves . If you are going to give a movie a bad review, please make sure your review is rational, and not based on the fact you are willingly ignorant. Keep it to yourself and move on.

B0009MAP90|5.0|Hearing Bob Dylan's 1962 debut album is quite a revelatory experience. After forty years of albums of varying quality and varying musical styles, Dylan's very first LP might be shocking to the first-time listener. Here we have a 20-year-old Bob Dylan performing thirteen blues and folk songs with a gusto that he has rarely displayed since. I can't say it enough: these recordings are simply astounding. Dylan doesn't simply perform these songs. He attacks them as if he's out to prove himself to the world (Just look at that smug picture on the cover). He's announcing to the world: \\"Here is Bob Dylan. A name that you will never forget\\". This results in one of the most invigorating recordings of Dylan's career. Although only two of the songs were written by Dylan (\\"Talkin' New York\\" and \\"Song To Woody\\"), this is a fantastic album. Some of his best singing and guitar and harmonica playing are to be found here. He makes all of the traditional songs uniquely his own and delivers them in a sincerity you would never have guessed possible for a 20-year-old kid.  <br /> <br />This album is not what you would call one of Dylan's masterpieces, however it is an electrifying record that any serious fan of Bob Dylan should seek out. It's a rare glimpse at a young and hungry Bob eager to make his mark on the musical world. Highly recommended for all but newcomers.
B0000073I5|4.0|This is arguably the best Genesis solo album. Mike does a great long composition in the spirit of Supper's Ready where he displays his fabulous guitar work (guitar and bass). Great melodic music that Danjob continues to ignore. You  should not ignore this great work.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Many artists cut a Christmas album to cash-in on their popularity.  Unfortunately, too many take a very casual approach to their Christmas albums, not perfecting the sound as they would a regular album.  Fortunately, this is not true where the Carpenters are concerned.  Richard Carpenter had the Carpenter's Christman album pictured the way he wanted it, and then took the time to get it right.  The result is a lush, beautifully arranged sound with every effort made to make each song special.  In essence, the Carpenters created Christmas music that defines what Christmas music should sound like.<br /><br />This album is actually the \\"best\\" of two Christmas albums that Richard and Karen previously released.  \\"Christmas Portrait\\", their first Christmas album was released in 1978, and An Old-Fashioned Christmas, released in 1984 after Karen's tragic death.  When the first Christmas album was conceived, Karen and Richard recorded so much Christmas material that they almost released a double album. Instead, they released a full single disk, (Christmas Portrait, 1978) but packed it with nearly 50 minutes of music - which was pushing the limits back in the days of vinyl LPS.  Christmas Portrait went platinum in the U.S. and became a hit all over the world, and it continues to do well. It is one of the few albums that has been a Top 10 hit on the Christmas charts in the `70s, `80s, and `90s.  These are the songs you hear played in department stores and on the radio every Christmas season.  In 1984, A&M released the second Carpenter's Christmas album, \\"An Old-Fashioned Christmas\\". The album features the best of the overflow from the Christmas Portrait sessions as well as some newly recorded pieces.<br /><br />Now, if you want every Christmas song the Carpenters ever recorded, you have no choice but to purchase both originals, however, if you want the best of both, 31 songs in all, then this is the album for you.<br /><br />You will love the Christmas sound of the Carpenters and will play it every Christmas season.  It is an A+ album and is perhaps the finest Christmas album ever recorded.<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig, Carpenters Fan for 35 yearsrpenters and will play it every Christmas season.  It is an A+ album and is perhaps the finest Christmas album ever recorded.   <br /> <br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig, Carpenters Fan for 35 years  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0634049011|5.0|This book is the real deal. The explanations are the model of clarity, and the exercises are laid out in a cogent, lucid fashion. As I worked through them, I reignited the urge to practice and improve. The author has also stimulated within me the urge to understand, which is one of the hallmarks of a great teacher. For all the treaures it offers, it really is a bargain. Buy it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I purchased her original cd many years ago, and thought that she was one of the most gifted singers around.  <br /> <br />Years later, I'm so glad to see that she's still performing and producing great work. This cd reminds me of her original work.  I hope that she continues to use what works best for her.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Johnny is a homeless, angry young man who can speak at great length and with GREAT eloquence on an incredibly wide variety of topics. He is smarter than basically anyone he meets or ever will meet but he has no job, no place to live and has no interest in having either. He arrives in London and sets out on an odyssey through the night to spread his philosophy on life to anyone who will listen. Doesn't sound like much of a film huh? Make no mistake this is one of the best films EVER made and contains a performance that can match De Niro, Hoffman or Brando any day. David Thewlis won best actor at cannes for his genuinely incredible performance in this masterpiece, and it's easy to see why. The raw power that he brings to this role has to be seen to be believed. Some people expressed surprise at his lack of an academy award nomination. Let's be honest about it. The performances that stay with you after the credits roll are too good for oscars. Day-Lewis in Gangs Of New York,Samuel L. Jackson in Jungle Fever, Campbell Scott in Roger Dodger, Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire, Newman in Hud and most of all David Thewlis for this film. Ignore the hype about the violence in this film. Robert De Niro played a violent person in Raging Bull and what did he get? A golden globe AND the oscar. David Thewlis lost because he played this role with unblinking conviction. De Niro was sexually violent in CAPE FEAR and he was nominated at the academy awards. Thewlis and De Niro both took the method approach to these roles, so why did the academy overlook Thewlis? If this film didn't win the best actor and best director awards at Cannes I seriously think that it would be virtually unknown. Now that Thewlis and director Mike Leigh are back in the public eye. Thewlis in KINGDOM OF HEAVEN and Leigh with his harrowing VERA DRAKE, it is a perfect time for a new audience to discover NAKED and see it for what it is a masterpiece. Like always the best films are sadly unavailable on dvd. This film is one of those rare times when I'd even settle for an extras free disc. If it wasn't for criterion, modern masterpieces like NAKED would come out on dvd with nothing but a trailer. There are two reasons why NAKED didn't win the oscars for best actor,film or screenplay: money and politics. This film wasn't marketable or politically correct. To see an actor like Thewlis wasted in rubbish films like Dragonheart is ridiculous. You would think that an awards academy who gave Sean Penn an oscar for his performance in Mystic River where he played an ultimately vicious and violent character and Anthony Hopkins who played one of the most evil characters of recent memory in The Silence Of The Lambs would at least give THewlis a nomination. Thewlis gives one of the best performances in the history of cinema and regardless of what the academy thought of the film Thewlis has created a character that will never be forgotten. At the end of the day a film like NAKED can't be measured by the box office or the amount of awards that it wins but by it's impact on a visceral level.lm is one of those rare times when I'd even settle for an extras free disc.

B000000I0Q|4.0|This is a fabulous piece of work by Steve that really captures the Genesis spirit and reveals his abilities as a great writer. I also like this one because I fooled Danjob Pebonr into thinking this was Genesis. It really does sound like Genesis- Phil's on it and so is Mike.
B00005JLEX|4.0|Seinfeld as a show is still in a process of defining itself during seasons 1 and 2.  Season 1 contains only 5 episodes and this whole volume may appear different from the Seinfeld that's in your mind (different furniture in Jerry's apartment, etc...).  However, I still highly recommend it and it has great extra features like commentaries and things.
B000819PKC|5.0|It seems that JK finally found a bass player that is along the same vein as the ex-jamiroquai drummer Stuart Zender.  I especially love 7 days in sunny June.

B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban brings fans to the classical pop genre including myself. I have never been a huge fan of classical pop, but Josh made it sound great for me. His voice is powerful and will hook you from the very first track. The background music behind Groban just enhances his vocals ever more beautifully and also hooks you to his songs. He holds a poppish tint to his music to bring in young and old fans alike to his album, and yet he brings a touch of classical to the music as well. I find myself liking this blend of music very well on this album. I couldn't have a whole collection of classical music, but Josh Groban's album Closer is indeed one I love owning. He brings a unique touch to my collection and I still find myself hearing this c.d. all the time.  <br />There are a few songs on here that dull to the power of his other songs, but Josh makes it hard, with his beautiful voice, to hate any of the songs. Yet his more stronger songs I always find myself hiting the repeat button on are Oceano, My Confession, Mi Mancherai, Si Volvieras A Mi, When You Say You Love Me, Remember When It Rained, and of course You Raise Me Up. They are for me his greatest songs on Closer.  <br />Many complain that a lot of his songs are non- English, but I find those songs to be just as beautiful and strong as the English tracks. He brings beauty to more than one language and I love it. I think Josh has great range and I would certainly enjoy hearing more from him. I would give a solid four stars for his songs, and five stars for his voice. I highly recommend this album.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|One of the most powerful movies I've ever seem. Most peole say that this film is sad, but I find the film to be hopeful. Two people lost in their lives, and need to find a way to cope and recover. I'm a huge movie fan so i won't tell you anything more... This moive is in my top ten. Powerful! As the viewer of this great film one has to look for the deep meanings of this film, it doesn't give it out to you like most hollywood junk.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|First: this is not a masterpiece or something like this. But in a way it is a very good eye in the contemporary life's in some ordinary people. After watch this movie you could get the answers from many questions: <br />1) How bad and insane is the life's many people in USA <br />2) Why women usually are wiser than men <br />3) The whole society in United States have a big problem called happiness and just know to live <br />4) What happens with the people who forget life's too short and the world outside it's too big and diverse <br />5) How strong is the absence of variety in most americans <br />6) How Mr Bush could be the President in this society <br />Anyways, rent it (don't buy it) and taste some bitter sensation.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|In terms of its ability to scare and disturb, \\"Saw\\" is an A+ film. It's extremely raw and gritty, full of suspense, and contains some seriously disturbing subject matter and several now-infamous scenes of intense terror. However, there are several glaring flaws in this film as well. The script, while clever in some ways, could use reworking and polishing. A lot of the story feels sort of thrown together. Also, there are couple of performances that feel a bit amateur and over-the-top, namely that of Leigh Whannell. A little restraint can go a long way! James Wan is clearly a very talented director, but his direction of \\"Saw\\" feels at times a bit unrestrained or in need of some tweeking (much like the above mentioned elements) But despite these problems, \\"Saw\\" is one hell of an adrenaline rush to watch, and should please the most hardcore of horror fans. (FYI: there's not quite as much gore in this film as its reputation would lead you to believe, so, gore hounds, don't get too excited)
B00001OH7P|5.0|Hunky Dory is and will continue to be my favorite Bowie album; in fact, it's veering close to favorite album of all time. I really wouldn't be surprised if turns out to be That Album. That Album I tell my kids, grandkids, and anyone in between about how it changed my life. About how it taught me the sheer joy in simplicity, suddle cynicism and clever abnormality  combatted by masterful hokeyness. Life!    Ziggy Stardust, released just a year later (1972), is not much of a stretch, however, Bowie certainly strutted his confidence a bit more. Adopting a new alias and putting on stellar live performances as The Guy himself, showing the world he knew he could make it big. And you're gonna listen. All of you.     Where Hunky Dory was nuanced in a way that seemed almost self-conscious, rather folksy, and deeply personal, Ziggy Stardust has his talents flung out for the world to see, slapping you in the face on its way to the heavens. And gosh darnit, there's some soul. (See: \\"Soul Love\\"... \\"It Ain't Easy\\") His phenomenal sax playing really adds something to the general flow of the album. His guitars are cranked up a couple of notches as well. When one cut on Hunky Dory was full on electric (\\"Queen Bitch\\"), the entire production of Ziggy Stardust pretty much relies on said method. \\"Moonage Daydream\\" houses one of the top 100 greatest guitar solos of all time. A song of a mere 4 minutes and 38 seconds that seems much, much longer and much, much more complex than it actually is. An epic, a story, and I heard it last night while watching SCHOOL OF ROCK.     Bowie's weird, and Bowie's thoughtful, and Bowie knows how to hold an audience captive. He throws in strange howls and pronunciations, groovy rhythm in his lyrics, and (if it was intentional or not) drenches every last bit of it in sex appeal.     You won't ever know unless you hear it for yourself.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Vocla similarity to Billie Holiday notwithstanding, this is a fabulous album.  Her interpretations are lovely.  The accompaniment and her singing captures the mood of these songs and makes them her own.  5 stars from beginning to end...
B000002IGV|5.0|I suppose Stay Hungry made mainstream success over Under the Blade partly because not as many people are interested in Twisted Sister's ultimate rawness. <br /> <br />Stay Hungry was my first Twisted Sister album, and it never disappointed me. Like many, my favorite on this one was \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", followed closely by the title track \\"Stay Hungry\\", \\"Burn in Hell\\", and \\"The Price\\". <br /> <br />I don't listen to this album as much now as I did the first two months I had it, because I soon got Under the Blade, You Can't Stop Rock N Roll, and Love is for Suckers. I still greatly enjoy reminiscing back to the elementary school days when I'd be listening to this all the time at max volume on my CD player. <br /> <br />Yup, Stay Hungry is still at the top, though from the looks of it, more people are starting to acknowledge twisted Sister's other albums through this one.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|\\"Special Collector's Edition\\"?? What does that mean? Who has a collection of movies that's as utterly stupid as this one?  Why not throw in \\"Before Sunrise\\", \\"Before Sunset\\" and \\"Lost in Translation\\"?<br /><br />If you need to see puking puppets and listen to every movie cliche in the business, then 'collect' this.  Otherwise, if you have a brain cell's worth of decency, don't waste your money on this worthless waste of the 1's and 0's on the DVD.<br /><br />This thing is STUPID, STUPID STUPID!!!!!<br /><br />I read one review elsewhere where the critic was griping about the lack of 'diversity' of the crew....  Big flying whoop!  The diversity of marionettes, what next?  If I thought these stupid puppets \\"represented\\" me, I'd file a class-action civil rights suit.
B000001GQQ|1.0|This is simply the worst recording of this concerto.  I realize she was young, but it is unmusical, almost as if the idea is to play just the opposite of what the composition calls for. Sort of out Gould Gould.  The slow movement has no tempo whatsover, just lays there and Abbaddo's conducts in his 2nd rate Von Karajan style.  Avoid this. <br />
0143034901|5.0|I recently bought and read two books: The Historian and The Shadow of the Wind.  I liked the Historian, but The Shadow of the Wind completely stunned me.  The story is an intricate, multi-layered complexity with which I became progressively encaptivated.  Many readers of mysteries like to predict a story's next development. I prefer to wait and be surprised,  enjoying the bliss that results while reading a work of superior writing filled with intense emotions, moods, and remarkable characters.<br /><br />Every work of writing has its faults; but remember no human being is perfect.  Beauty is always subjective as it is based on the eye of its beholder.  From my view, this work of fiction is marvellous.  Others have already described the story, and I have no wish to ruin the discovery for potential readers.  I will say  this.  Do not rush the story; savor the intensity of moods and emotions pervasive throughout.  Identify with the characters' frailty, despair, anguish, ruthlessness, generosity, and triumph.  This story will haunt me for a long time.  I cannot yet let it go.
0385659806|5.0|If you've ever wondered what it would feel like if you had autism, read this book.  Of course, not every person with an autism spectrum disorder is the same, but Mark Haddon describes the fundamentals of how many people with autism experience the world. What we may see as quirky, makes perfect sense to Christopher, the story's narrator, a fifteen year old boy with autism. As an autism consultant, I highly recommend this novel.
B00001QEFU|5.0|I probably should have said it in my first review, but I'm really a 14 year old kid using my mom's account. <br /> <br />My older sister had the album Stay Hungry when I was little, and I found myself listening to it quite a bit. Last Christmas I got my own copy of it, and this got me interested to see what other music Dee Snider and the gang had come out with. So, I found this album, Under the Blade. The title track caught my interest the first time I listened to the 30-second preview, and once I got my hands on the CD I found \\"Under the Blade\\" to be my all-time favorite Twisted Sister song. My other favorites on this album are \\"Run for your Life\\", \\"Bad Boys (of Rock N Roll)\\", and \\"Shoot Em Down\\". <br /> <br />The one and only thing that disappointed me about this album was the sound (or lack thereof) that the snare drum made. Just imagine if that sound was replaced with the roaring snare sound that they had on Love is for Suckers! It's good regardless of the snare, but I think it might have been better if they got a louder sound for when they remastered it. Everything else, I think, is top notch, except for the lyrics that were included. Like I said in my last review for Love is for Suckers, the lyrics are missing lines, have wrong words etc. <br /> <br />Despite these two points, Twisted Sister's debut album made it to the top of my favorites list. I think Under the Blade far outdoes Stay Hungry, even though that was TS's biggest hit.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Friend got me onto this album and I love it. Every track through the CD is different but still great. Best to be listened to a t full volume!
B000957O82|3.0|This film had its very funny moments, even though it was dumbed down to about seventh grade humor.  Get ready for that seventh grade humor(ha ha).   Will Smith is a pretty good actor and it's fun to watch what his character will do next.  Kind of a formula picture, but it's good and fairly innocent fun.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The much anticipated \\"X & Y\\" was not a disappointment.  The band broadened and enhanced their already full sound with layers of instrumentation and vocal harmonies.  One can hear the influence of Greats (such as U2 and Lennon) in the unique music of Coldplay.  Not only is this a stellar album, but it translates well on stage.  Having seen a recent performance in Darian Center, it was wonderful to see the Band's new material augment the old. Coldplay is truly a young group with the potential to be rocking three generations of listeners!
0312323859|4.0|I'll admit that I couldn't stand Darcy in the first book, and even wished Rachel would finally stand up to her. So I wasn't sure I'd like an entire book about the woman I didn't like in Something Borrowed, but I did. While I thought that Darcy's transformation was a bit convenient considering how she was portrayed in the first book, the story and writing were what kept me turning the pages. Darcy does redeem herself in this book, although I thought her personality change and realization felt a little rushed. Still, Giffin is a wonderful writer who gives readers engaging stories.
B00005JKL8|5.0|Very explicited film, giving the viewer nothing new in the way of the story. I was on the edge of my seat all the way through especially during the SAM attack on the airplane. Hackman gives his standard fine performance as the Admiral willing to scrap his career for one of his men, and Wilson does his commendable job fighting against the Bosnia terrorist and running across the dangerous ground.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I'm an 80s' guy~come on now. Who could resist Duran-Duran!? This is a great one from them even when they were a little short on members.
B000005S0E|5.0|Alright, I'm not going to say that this is the \\"best\\" Cure album because taste is subjective (a clear example of this is how so many people claim \\"Wish\\" or \\"Bloodflowers\\" is their best effort). However, I will say that this easily my favourite Cure record, and I haven't enjoyed any other work of theirs more than this one.  <br /> <br />This is the Cure at their most bizarre. Some of the songs are just plain weird (in a good way) and they've never been as wildly experimental since. It's also their most manic, as it begins with the heavy, torturous \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" and then goes to the sweet, dreamy (and a little wistful) \\"Bird Mad Girl\\". The first two tracks are basically a metaphor for the rest of the album- up and down with a completely ass-backwards sense of pacing. But please, trust me- this turns out to be only a good thing. The album is never easy on you. It forces you to jar from one mood to the next, and by the end you feel satisfied and happy. <br /> <br />All that babbling aside, the main reason this album is so damn good is the songs themselves. \\"Bird Mad Girl\\", \\"Dressing Up\\", \\"Wailing Wall\\" and \\"The Empty World\\" are my personal favorites, but every song has something entirely different to offer. It even gave us one of the Cure's most poppy (and deeply enjoyable) singles, the light, bumbly and sweet love song \\"The Caterpillar\\". <br /> <br />If you're not afraid to make an investment on an album you may not like, I highly recommend you give this one a try. It's the Cure doing what they do best- making stilted, delightfuly bizarre  pop. It's not as accessable as \\"The Head on the Door\\" (but it's significantly better) or as overtly poppy as \\"Japanese Whispers\\" (but again, it's significantly better) or as doomy and monotone as \\"Pornography\\" (and again...) but it has its own version of the Cure musical aesthetic to offer, and it's one that's overtly more satisfying than a number of their albums.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|....a great remastering of a pop classic!  GUILTY is a perfect pairing of two pop icons.
068987474X|5.0|This is a great book and I truely believe what it tells you.  It's hard to put to practice some of the things it tells you to do, but I know its the way it is today.  I'm an independent gal and this book layed it all out for me.
B000069HJN|5.0|What can I say...I'm a fan. Just get it. I've been filling in some spaces in my artists collections and Supertramp is a must have, I've got quite a few of their albums. I can honestly say they are all very well done. The musicianship is tops!
B000002H2Z|5.0|It's not my favourite Cure album, by any means, but I do like it quite a bit. <br /> <br />It seems with this album, they put more effort into making the music more accessable (which is, of course, a good thing)and they did so with poise. Even though it has very \\"poppy\\" moments it's still nice and wierd, and sounds like a natural progression from their previous album \\"The Top\\", which was slightly manic and cluttered (though probably my favourite Cure album). \\"The Head on the Door\\" is more cohesive and far less psychotic, which is both a good thing and a bad thing (as this probably began their digression into the stagnant guitar pop that would peak with the boring \\"Wish\\" album). <br /> <br />Still, it's a collection of damn good songs. The album's single, \\"Inbetween Days\\" is fantastic, cheery jangle-pop. \\"Close To Me\\" is a cute, obsessive little number, \\"The Baby Screams\\" is another fine example of how fantastic a bassist Simon Gallup is, and, my personal favourite, \\"The Blood\\" is a jumpy, Latin-influenced song that showed off how damn good Porl Thompson is. <br /> <br />Highly, highly recommended, particularly if you're a fan of their mid-eights psychedlic pop phase.
B000002H2H|5.0|A while back I thought RTL and MOP were equally tied for being Metallica's best album.  Then one day I was pissed and put in MOP to thrash out my anger to.  And guess what it didnt work.  So then I decided to buy RTL and HOLY CRAP.  Lets just say the first 35 seconds had me in total outrage before soon realizing it was a total work of genius.  For those not familiar with RTL, I am referring to a lovely acoustic intro turned into a blazing guitar riff at a zillion mph which can have any first-time listener yelling out for a pair of ear plugs.  But the onslaught only begins there.  We are soon introduced to Hetfield's dark and rapidly maturing voice with his mean signature growl which can be stuck in a persons head for days thanks to how scary he really sounds.  Every song tries something new and every song succeeds mightily.   <br /> <br />First lets find out why is Metallica's best album in their outstanding catalog. <br />Let's face it. Metallica's 1983 debut album Kill Em All had absolutely childish and immature vocals by Hetfeld and the songs like Seek&Destroy get repetitive after a few listens. Good album nonetheless.  <br />Master of Puppets is hailed by many as metallica's masterpiece and rightfully so. Everything on it from tracks 1-8 is excellent. Ride the lightning is just pure perfection.  <br />And Justice for all is another excellent album but is the ultimate endurance test. Come on we're talking an average of over 7 minutes per song. Not to mention horrible production. You just feel so much more passion on RTL.  <br />The Black Album...Metallica's commercial turn. The world finally noticed them (and yes that is a good thing). Good place to start if your new to them.   <br />Load is where metallica's sound changed drastically. Tough to compare this to Ride The Lightning. All I can say is that they were better at their old stuff, although I enjoyed this one. <br />Reload is pretty much the same thing as Load. Therefore I read my take on Load.  <br />I think we all know the story with St. Anger. CRAP. If metallica were graded on this from editorial reviewers they'd probably be lucky to get an F or zero stars or whatever. Ride The Lightning destroys this CD. <br /> <br />I wont waste my time reviewing the songs since its up to the listener to make up their mind about each one.  But I will say this.  Four words explain this entire album. <br /> <br />Fight Fire With Fire <br /> <br />These four words describe EVERYTHING about this metal monster. <br />In this case it means fight screaming with more screaming, blazing and mindblowing guitar solos with more blazing and mindblowing solos, lyrics about death with more lyrics about death, insanely intense drumming with more insanely intense drumming, and most of all, SERIOUS HEADBANGING WITH MORE SERIOUS HEADBANGING! ROCK TO THE WORLD OF OLD METALLICA!!!!! <br />
B000819PKC|3.0|My boyfriend and I love Jamiroquai. We're from Charlotte NC and of course Jamiroquai's Dynomite isn't over here yet so we had to purchase it from Ebay. My favorite songs on there are Black Devil Car and Dynomite of course. Everything is ok but it just doesn't feel right. I miss the Space Cowboy/Synchronized days. Sounds like Jay and the band were experimenting which is ok but I miss all the funkiness and violins. I'm still a big fan though and I look forward to future albums.

0385513755|3.0|I don't have much to add to my title. Anyone who doesn't know the plot details won't discover them here, but I'll offer this advice: if you want a fun, fast-moving, less deep than you've probably heard reading experience, you won't go wrong here. Also, don't forget, this is FICTION, folks, fiction. Made up. Don't let it change your outlook on reality because you're not really being initiated into a secret; and also don't let it rile you up in unnecessary defense of Christianity--Christianity will survive this book. TDVC is just a story. That's all. And not a bad one at that, although I did find myself at the end thinking, \\"OK, so there's this \\"sacred feminine\\" earth goddess religion here that's survived underground in neo-Gnostic fashion. Why is it any better than Christianity? With its ritual orgies and inbreeding caste lines....why is it necessarily superior to Christianity?\\"<br /><br />But, hey, TDVC delivered on its promise of a (mostly) suspenseful story and gave me my money's worth. I wish everyone would calm down: it's just somebody's novel, not a blueprint for a new faith and not a knockout blow to the followers of Jesus.

Hard.<br /><br />Fans of the graphic novel wondered whether Del Toro, who had directed \\"The Devil's Backbone\\" and \\"Blade 2\\", could manage to conjure the magic of Mike Mignola's masterwork---replete with elaborate chiaroscuro illustrations and obscure historical allusions and references (the Thule Society, Grigory Rasputin, the slumbering beasts culled straight from the Lovecraft mythos)---into a studio-produced feature film---and not drown the flick in hours of exposition?<br /><br />Del Toro pulled it off brilliantly, working ferociously with Director of Photography Guillermo Navarro to bring Mignola's high style and potent brew of lumbering star-spawned monsters, diabolical Nazis, undead assassins, grave-bound liches, international plots, and brutal secret societies up on the big screen.<br /><br />Del Toro plunges us down onto a rain-spattered storm-besieged Scottish island in 1944. The Third Reich is collapsing under the relentless Allied onslaught in the West and the Soviet steamroller in the East. Desperate, Hitler's Thule Society dispatched former Russian \\"Mad Monk\\" Grigory Rasputin (Karel Roden, channeling the crazed ascetic) to rip open a portal into another dimension, unleashing the slumbering eldritch beasts of the Ogdru-Jahad---slavering demons---upon the Allies.<br /><br />American G.I.s break up the party, but too late---something slips through: a fire-engine red little Imp with a taste for Baby Ruth bars. The dogfaces name him \\"Hellboy\\".<br /><br />From there we cut to the present, where Hellboy (Ron Perelman, who just owns the movie) is all growed up into a full-fledged Demon, doing Hellboy things: pumping iron, surrounded by legions of his beloved cats, smoking a stogie, eating pancakes.<br /><br />Oh, and he files his horns down. To \\"fit in\\".<br /><br />The young Professor \\"Broom\\" Bruttenholm (the flawless John Hurt), who discovered Hellboy, has also aged---but Hellboy clocks his birthdays according to Hell's timetable. Bruttenholm is pushing 85 and looking for a successor.<br /><br />The candidate: young FBI Agent John Myers (Rupert Evans, doing a good job of looking nervous), who serves Hellboy his pancakes and rides with him and telepathic Fish-pal Abe Sapien (body by Doug Jones, voice by David Hyde Pierce, fondness for raw eggs) on a five-alarm demon-stomp at the Museum of Natural History.<br /><br />The rest of the flick is a wild, sleekly visual, hyper-kinetic Devil's hayride of Cool, High Style, and demon-on-demon action. It's not a big surprise when Hellboy's battle royale with \\"Hound of the Resurrection\\" Sammael leads the BPRD to grimmer stuff: a global plot headed up by sinister plotters thought long dead: Rasputin, his yummy Teutonic squeeze Ilsa (Biddy Hodson channeling Eva Braun), and undead Nazi killer Karl Ruprect Kroenen (Ladislav Beran, who steals every scene he wheezes, slices, and dices through), who makes up in razor-bladed carnage what he lacks in conversation.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" is 360 degrees of cool. Stop the tape a minute: let's rewind to that scene on the remote Scottish island. Look at the windswept, ghoul-haunted ruins; check out Rasputin's jerry-rigged Hand of Doom, ringed with crispy globules chittering and crackling with electricity; marvel at the waves of darkness as the nervous G.I.'s scramble across the slick black rock, while white-suited insect-eyed Nazi scientists gear up the machinery to tear Hell wide open---and glance nervously into the hungry shadows.<br /><br />Note the way that krieg light slips into the well between the worlds, spins in a graceful balletic arc toward the slumbering crystallized Elder Gods, and bumps against it, startling open a drowsy demon eye. Nice. Del Toro is also consummately in control of his sound, moving instantly from pandemonium to dead silence.<br /><br />Guillermo keeps an iron hand on his little railroad to the Apocalypse: the direction is tight, neat, furious, fast-paced. The acting is all superior: Ron Perelman lives and breathes Hellboy. Jeff Tambor maintains deniability and smokes his stogie like a champ as the BPRD chieftain and uber-honcho.<br /><br />I've never liked Selma Blair: I find her google-eyes and over-large hands more Abe Sapien than sex-kitten, and she comes across as thoroughly disjointed and completely messed up. Given that her character is equally psycho, she works.Karel Roden growls and snarls and menaces effectively; Kroenen rocks the world without saying a word.<br /><br />But the real star of the show is Guillermo Navarro's flawless cinematography and Del Toro's tight directorial hand. Grab the Director's cut of the DVD: not only is it stuffed with extras you'd need a demon's lifetime to appreciate, but the extra footage and transfer add considerably to the final cut. Time to raise some Hell.<br /><br />JSGoul-haunted ruins; check out Rasputin's jerry-rigged Hand of Doom, ringed with crispy globules chittering and crackling with electricity; marvel at the waves of darkness as the nervous G.I.'s scramble across the slick black rock, while white-suited insect-eyed Nazi scientists gear up the machinery to tear Hell wide open---and glance nervously into the hungry shadows.  <br /> <br />Note the way that krieg light slips into the well between the worlds, spins in a graceful balletic arc toward the slumbering crystallized Elder Gods, and bumps against it, startling open a drowsy demon eye.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Death Cab for a while. I've loved every album, but each one has had a point or two I thought was a little weak. That hasn't stopped them from being my favorite band, but there would be songs I wouldn't care a lot for and skip through. But this album is absolutely perfect. Be warned, this album is dark. But in this darkness Ben Gibbard shows more introspection than ever before. The lyrics are touching and sincere. \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" may be the most beautiful song I have ever heard. \\"Brothers on a hotel bed\\" show a sincerity from Gibbard that makes your heart ache. There are catchy more poppy songs on here with \\"Soul Meets Body\\" and \\"Crooked Teeth\\", but fot the most part Gibbard uses piano and soft acoustics to drive home his emotional lyrics. This album is breathtaking and a must for any fan of Death Cab or fans of good music in general. The leap to a big label has not hurt Death Cab at all. In fact, they are stronger than ever before.
B000AADYYO|4.0|This is a brilliant cd. No one can take that away from Opeth. Their musical brilliance soars beyond any other band, and they will go down in history as one of the most talented underground bands ever. As popular as they may be, theyre still not mainstream(thankfully). However, this album pretty much just showcases most of their albums in 67 minutes of music. The haunting beauy of \\"My Arms Your Hearse\\", \\"Blackwater Park\\". The prog parts of \\"Damnation\\". And there are parts that some of you may recognize from \\"Morningrise\\". It's original in itself and in comparison to the rest of the music out there. However in comparison to other Opeth albums, it fall short.  <br /> <br />In conclusion: Strong release, but it's just typical Opeth reviving some old riffs.

B00001IVOF|4.0|During the release of Hell On Earth, Mobb Deep was in the mist of the East Coast vs. West Coast battle especially against the late 2pac.  \\"Drop A Gem On 'Em\\" strikes back on all attacks over a static piano looped, fast paced track.  Continuing with \\"Bloodsport\\" and \\"Get Dealt With\\" the Mobb remain steadfast on violence and gun play over simple production and heavy bass lines.  Havoc's solo song, \\"More Trife Life\\", is about getting set up by a woman and being held hostage.  Marketing their traits of thugging is constant; \\"Can't Get Enough Of It\\" featuring General G is a good example of how it's done in NYC.  On another note, a quite eerie one, \\"G.O.D. Pt. III\\" gives a little more for the listeners besides the norm. War with the police and surviving in the ghettos was a good description over the title track.  Heed to the \\"Apostle's Warning\\" these Queensbridge emcees are \\"Still Shinin'\\" as underdogs.  All of the production was done by the duo with simplicity and that's their niche, nothing complicated.  Now a part of 50 Cent's G-Unit hopeful their edge doesn't dull.
0399152717|5.0|When it comes to all out entertainment Clive Cussler is hard to beat. He's written another adrenaline pounding adventure that will please all his fans. Combining Indy Jones and 007 genres, you'll be in for the adventure of the summer. The way Cussler mixes science and adventure makes this one of my favorite summer books so far.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000002UAX|5.0|If Magical Mystery tour may be considered as the First work of a transient trilogy that continued with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the White Album would be without doubt, the successful culmination of a true metamorphosis and musical improvement conceived as perpetual innovations and new sounds.<br /><br />In White Album we have the confluence of rhythms, challenging newness in the musical language, forerunner sonorities for the age that we just could have found in outstanding bands such as Vanilla Fudge, Led Zepellin, Cream, or Jimmy Hendrix `s experience among the most remarkable ones.<br /><br />The astonishing mood and rapture creativeness could be easily compared with a volcano in eruption. The genius touch of the Beatles was the accurate ensemble of easy going themes for great audiences as O- bla-di O- bla-da and Revolution both versions, delicate country folk influence themes such as Bungalow Bill, Cry, baby cry and Honey pie, soft ballades as Julia (one of their best songs), I will, Good bye, Dear Prudence and Martha my dear, an irreverent and anti establishment (for the age) song  like Back in the USRR with authentic outpost songs such the impressive While my guitar keeps gently,  Helter- skelter, (Notice the Finale and then go for Doors The Soft Parade), I' m so tired,  Happiness is a warm gun, for not make mention about premonitory echoes, spelling mystery and higher spirits suggested in Number Nine and the song whose title may be placed among the longest title ever written for a song in Record Guinness, I `m talking about \\"Everybody gets something to hide except to me and my monkey.\\"<br /><br />How to deny the marked influence of this album in late bands such as Gentle Giant, REM, Police?<br /><br />This album is not only a superlative and mile-stone record but besides part of the rock mythology if you let me put me on this way.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I have been listening to this album for the last 6 hours at work, and though I find myself listening to same song again almost twice an hour I still love it. I'm sick of these whiney brats complaining about the album being to \\"polished\\". What the hell is wrong with having an album that sounds clear? track 2 is a personal favorite, and every time it comes on I catch myself taking a short little break from work to listen to it. Good stuff.
0800141660|5.0|Ang Lee's first Engish-language film, \\"Sense\\" is a vivid period drama, intelligent and involving, and benefitting from Austen's skewering of English social mores, gossip and materialism. Young Winslet is striking in a fiery, star-making turn, more than holding her own beside the gifted and appealing Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay-and got the Oscar for it).
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of A Down's Fourth Album was released on the 17th of may this year, and i believe is thier best album to date.  Daron Malakian has taken his creativity to an all time high, writing most of the lyrics, singing more, and playing muliple instruments.  He is quoted in guitar world, talking about his love of song writing and says,\\"Songwriting to me is just as mysterious as serial killing.\\" and his songs are as mysterous as he is.  This guy is a musical genius, he definitly dots his I's and crosses his T's when it comes to his music, he looks at every detail, in fact before each concert and recording he sharpens the edges of his guitar picks to have a clearer, crisper sound.  This CD is wonderful, very progressive and innovative.  System has an unmistakable sound to their music, a sound all their own, some people say it sounds like someone is having a tourette's sezure. <br /> <br />This CD is one of those CD's that you can play from start to finish, you don't have to skip any songs that suck, because there aren't any.   <br /> <br />I'm not to fond of songs with political messages, but the songs like that on this CD are OK.  I just think that the music itself is awesome.  If you like any of the other System CD's than you will like this one, i recomend this CD to anyone.  I can't wait until Hypnotize is released in the fall.
B00000IBDY|4.0|I got this for my birthday a few weeks ago, and wow, what a great record!  It's always cool to find something this good that you haven't heard before.  Not just \\"My White Bicycle\\" which is still one of the classic psych pop tunes of all time, but the whole record.  And I was amazed that anyone could do such a fantastic and more than credible version of Strawberry Fields Forever.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched this show while it was on the air, though I did hear about it from a few fans when it went on Sci-Fi.  Now that I've actually seen it (at the request of a coworker), I'm amazed.  This is the best show I've seen in years.  It's Brisco County Junior....in space, with a little Ocean's Eleven thrown in for flavor.<br /><br />A terrific ensemble cast with amazing chemistry, great western style and music, superb dialogue, and tremendous variety from episode to episode.  It is truly a loss to the airwaves that this show is no longer on the air.  I truly hope the upcoming movie manages to capture even a tiny bit of the greatness in these episodes.<br /><br />Two thumbs up and then some!  :)  These DVDs are worth your money!
B00003CXB7|5.0|Ground-breaking film is likely Altman's greatest work, a subtle and seamless blending of comedy and anti-war film that's as fresh and irreverent today as when released. (Extensive use of overlapping dialogue sequences was a first at the time.) Top-notch performances throughout and at times, unbearably funny.
B00004RF98|5.0|I purchased this DVD at the request of my 9 year old daughter! She danced to \\"Good Morning\\" with her dance troupe this year. So, we rented the DVD, and then she wanted to own it and the soundtrack. She had enjoyed the DVD so much! Both my young dancing daughters love to watch and dance along.  The music and dancing are fabulous! If you love musicals, than this is the DVD for you. What a pleasure to be able to share such a classic with my kids. It is a DVD the whole family enjoys!
B00005OWEG|5.0|Though both the original and \\"Redux\\" are worthy, they suffer from director Coppola's narrative excesses, the longer \\"Redux\\" even more so. Still, the new version includes new scenes which clarify some loose ends in the original.  Either way,  it's an epic, mesmerizing acid-trip of a war movie that melds together the savage themes of Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" with the inherent waste of Vietnam. Grand spectacle, augmented by brilliant use of music.  Acting is superb, from Sheen, Duvall and Hopper in particular. Even bald, bloated, incoherent Brando fascinates. Once seen, never forgotten.
0915811774|5.0|This is a great book. I will tell you a story. About 3 years ago, I bought this book and only read the first few pages and put it down. I ended up giving it away and later rediscovered the book after having read CREATING MONEY. At first, I didn't realize that it was the same book I'd had before! This time, I loved the book! <br /> <br />What makes this book so great is that it is very approachable. Orin's channelings are always written in a basic language that is easy to understand. I've read channeled books which have very complicated language that can be difficult to read if you aren't used to reading technical material. <br /> <br />This book is filled with love. Every word is written from a heart -centered place and is designed so that you can feel this warmth inside of yourself. <br /> <br />Now, onto the meat of Soul Love. This book gives you detailed exercises about how to connect with your higher self and receive its love as well as visualization exercises for healing your relationships and finding a soul mate. Being very honest, Soul Love makes no promises that it can't keep. It doesn't lead you on about what soul mates are or how relationships work.  <br /> <br />It is mainly a book for self-discovery and owning the love within your own being FIRST, and then loving someone else. The deepest kind of love is always with yourself and by knowing and loving yourself, then you can reach out to someone else. <br /> <br />Soul Love is great because you can use it whether or not you are concerned about finding a soul mate. Maybe you've suffered abuse in your life or maybe you are discovering your spirituality and you want reassurance and guidance. This book can help. It can also help when you've had a painful experience with someone and you want to move forward. It shows you how to love yourself and that person from a place of universal love. You don't have to hold onto any relationship that hurts you, but you can hold on to the love that your higher self has for every person who has crossed your path, even someone who has hurt you. It gives you exercises so that you can make peace and move on.  <br /> <br />I don't think I can say enough about how real this book is and how full of love it is. I will say that it's not your usual book, so don't expect it to sound like other books (some of it will, and some of it won't). But if you are a fan of Sanaya Roman, you'll definately like this book. This is one of her best.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|Originally a 210-minute German mini-series edited down to feature length, \\"Boot\\" is haunting and works as an anti-war piece precisely because it is seen from the losing side. German actor Jurgen Prochnow turns in an intense portrayal of the boat's desperate captain. The film's other star-Peterson's camera-roves through the sub fluidly, never allowing the viewer a breath of escape or boredom.

B00012L786|5.0|Idiosyncratic director Sam Fuller's most successful film is prime noir, with priceless tough guy patter emanating from the scummy Skip, and also featuring a sultry femme fatale turn from Peters. On-location shooting in lower Manhattan adds an authentic feel, and the premise itself is a cut above most standard crime stories: beyond the espionage yarn, the audience yearns to know whether Skip, a man with no conscience, can develop one under extraordinary circumstances. Widmark is aces, as is Thelma Ritter playing Jo, a veteran stoolie. Noir fans should pounce.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|The review is for the Warner Brothers DVD released in 2004.    North by Northwest is a timeless classic involving action, adventure, drama, suspense and even some well-timed comedy, all rooted from a simple case of mistaken identity.  Cary Grant stars as Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue executive, who is accidentally mistaken for a secret government agent named George Kaplan.  Thornhill's main adversary is a spy for a foreign government named Phillip Vandamm (James Mason).  Along the way, Thornhill meets a beautiful blond named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who adds a lot of sex appeal along with several surprises to this wild and wonderful plot.    The movie is masterpiece for numerous reasons.  The first reason is because of the some of the unforgettable action shots including Grant being attacked by a crop dusting plane in a remote cornfield and then being chased across the face of Mount Rushmore.  But beyond just the action, there many brilliant scenes where Grant either alludes the people tracking him or simply just outsmarts them and does some impressive detective work on his own.  The script oozes with witty and clever lines with many visually memorable scenes as well.  Another strength of the movie is a powerful music score that accentuates every crucial moment in the film.  Furthermore, Grant and Mason give outstanding performances, perhaps their best.  The movie also breaks out of the old Hollywood overly restrained romance situations with some very forward dialogue and some sexually suggestive scenes between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (but still extremely tame by today's standards).   Finally, the widescreen color presentation is nothing short of spectacular.  Not only is this Hitchcock's best, but from my personal viewpoint, it ranks #4 on my list of the greatest movies ever made behind Casablanca and The Godfather I & II.  I have watched this movie at least six times over the past 25 years (now for the first time on DVD) and it still hasn't lost its edge.    As mentioned, the DVD quality is utterly fantastic for a film this old.  The widescreen color transfer is completely immaculate, and rich in color and sharpness - rivaling movies made today.  The sound is also outstanding for a film this old.  There many bonuses, but the best is the making of the film with a cross the country diary of how and where the movie was shot.  There is also a very good commentary by the Earnest Lehman who wrote the screenplay.      Movie: A+    DVD Quality: A+
6305882592|5.0|A warm and quirky comic gem that's built a sizable cult following over the years. Director Hal Ashby's second feature boasts inspired casting, with veteran stage actress Ruth Gordon irresistible as Maude, and Bud Cort so ideal for Harold that the young actor was forever typecast as a weirdo, as mentor Robert Altman had sagely predicted. Fabulous soundtrack from Cat Stevens.

B00065GX64|5.0|Fritz Lang's first sound film is a masterpiece of dread and suspense. Hans appears almost like the children he victimizes, soft and weak, and his fear of exposure almost makes us pity him. You can't conceive of anyone but Lorre pulling off this tricky characterization.  Lang creates a Berlin whose layout seems designed to expose the molester, a city of shadows, blind alleys, and a million unseen, unsparing eyes. Seventy five years after its release, this film retains its shock value. Along with \\"Metropolis\\", an early pinnacle for director Lang.
B00001QEE7|4.0|Quick delivery and a good product. Only one place where the DVD seems to \\"stick\\" a little. Picture otherwise was as good as new.
0784011710|5.0|For the first time, director Pakula exposed the breadth of Streep's prodigious talent when he cast her as Sophie. \\"Choice\\" is deliberately paced, literate, and atmospheric, and be warned - does include some disturbing flashback sequences. Above all, it's a Streep tour-de-force, netting her a well-deserved Oscar. Kline is also solid as the tragic Nathan. This devastating film will stay with you long after the lights come up.
B000002KMY|5.0|Heavier and darker than Heaven and Hell, and generally a better album. Amazing musicianship by the guys and stellar production by Martin Birch, metal's best producer. Buy it now or forever be sad.
B0001XALT6|5.0|Stallone wisely took the nuanced, meaty role of Freddy as a change of pace from his usual comic book hero parts, and he is surprisingly good here. Keitel is also aces as the crooked cop who has the most to lose, and Ray Liotta excels as Freddy's only friend. Smart and suspenseful, with a whiz-bang finish.
B000006ZDR|5.0|Heavier and darker than Heaven and Hell, and generally a better album. Amazing musicianship by the guys as well as stellar production by Martin Birch, metal's best producer. Buy it now or forever be sad.
0780021967|5.0|\\"Steps\\" is gripping and clever, with priceless chemistry and repartee between stars Donat and Carroll.  Hitchcock's most successful British film to-date, it introduced the  mistaken identity theme he'd employ again, most memorably in \\"North By Northwest\\". \\"Steps\\" was re-made twice, but the original towers above the rest. The climactic scene in the theatre is justly famous. Prime, pure Hitchcock.
B00000420F|5.0|As someone who knows next to nothing about opera but who loves music, I have to say that the music here is simply beyond anything I ever expected. It's is stunningly beautiful; it is an amazing accomplishment. It is - if anything is - high art.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|A cop film which boasts one of the best car chases ever-an exhilarating, 10-minute romp through the streets of San Francisco that's being imitated-\\"Bullitt\\" is the ultimate McQueen movie. The action sequences are taut and nerve-jangling, and the distinctive McQueen persona-reticent, self-reliant, cool under pressure-is fully formed and evoked. Of course, McQueen had one undeniable advantage: he was the coolest movie star of his time, and both he and \\"Bullitt\\" endure.

I have always said the \\"best jobs\\" I've ever had were those where I \\"worked for myself\\", which started when I was 13 and build a paper route up from scratch to 220 \\"customers\\" in a short time. Since then I went to college and have risen to CEO, but I still am not \\"truely working for myself\\". I have decided to leave my current \\"job\\" and go start a number of businesses and focus on \\"my bottom line\\". This book reinforced my decision.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This rousing, gorgeously photographed adventure movie exemplifies the magical heights Warner Brothers attained in the Golden Age of the studio system. Bolstered by a consistently clever script, with both humor and romance complementing the derring-do, \\"Adventures\\" is a milestone in Hollywood cinema- the first, and perhaps best, color swashbuckler, directed by Warner's stand-by Michael Curtiz (of \\"Casablanca\\" fame).
B000084T18|3.0|Get Rich or Die Tryin is a great debut album for 50. <br /> <br />\\"Intro\\" standard.

The next song is the best on the album \\"Patiently Waiting\\" features Eminem delivering a great 2nd verse. Great 1st and 3rd verses by 50 and good chorus. \\"Many Men\\" is a weak track, filler. \\"In Da Club\\" reinvented the word party track, one of the best 50 song ever. \\"High All the Time\\" is another weak filler track with nothing special at all. The next is a song about guns \\"Heat\\" is okay, kind of catchy. \\"If I Can't\\" has some good rhymes but is not standout at all. <br /> <br />\\"Blood Hound\\" featuring Young Buck picks it up a little, with fast paced rhymes and a good beat. \\"Back Down\\" has got a great beat but isn't the best lyrically, but it's listenable. The next song talks about being a \\"P.I.M.P.\\" great track with a good beat and chorus, and excellent verses. \\"Like My Style\\" isn't very good, kind of annoying and repetative. The next song \\"Poor Little Rich\\" isn't very good either, skip it.  <br /> <br />The last three songs are good. \\"21 Questions\\" has got a awesome flow and it features Nate Dogg. The 15th track \\"Don't Push Me\\" is downright excellent featuring Lloyd Banks and Eminem, Ems verse is particularly good. \\"Gotta Make it to Heaven\\" is a good song to end the album, nothing special but good enough.  <br /> <br />Overall Eminem and Dre really found some talent in 50. This album is much better than his next, The Massacre, which turned out to be exactly that. <br /> <br />Favorites(in order): <br />Patiently Waiting <br />Don't Push Me <br />In Da Club <br />P.I.M.P. <br />What Up Gangsta <br /> <br />-Kyle Walker
B0000549B0|5.0|Ang Lee's first Engish-language film, \\"Sense\\" is a vivid period drama, intelligent and involving, and benefitting from Austen's skewering of English social mores, gossip and materialism. Young Winslet is striking in a fiery, star-making turn, more than holding her own beside the gifted and appealing Thompson (who also wrote the screenplay-and got the Oscar for it).
B00006690G|4.0|The Eminem Show (Eminem third album) does not dissapoint, and it did the impossible, topped the Marshall Mathers LP. <br /> <br />\\"Curtains Up\\" just a standard intro. The album starts with \\"White America\\", very emotional song, I think it's very good but the chorus lacks. We get down to \\"Business\\" on the next track. Fast paced, Dre beat, excellent lyrics, what more do you want? Another very emotional song, \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" tells how it was like for him growing up and he explains his anger towards his mother. One of the best on the album. \\"Square Dance\\" is a great track with some tight lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"The Kiss\\" serves as an intro to soldier, kinda stupid. One of the best on the album is next \\"Soldier\\", a gangster like song with great lyrics, chorus and beat. The album stays fast paced with \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\", could have been one of Eminems best if it had a better chorus. But great lyrics make this one great. \\"Drips\\" is a weak song feat. Obie. The follow up single to \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" does not dissapoint. Although not as good as it's predecessor \\"Without Me\\" is a fast paced masterpiece with a good video as well.  Stupid \\"Paul Rosenberg\\" skit. The next track is, in my opinion, the best Eminem song ever. \\"Sing For the Moment\\" has everything, 3 of Em's best verses ever and Aeorsmith \\"Dream On\\" for the chorus. An excellent rock-rap masterpiece. <br /> <br />\\"Superman\\" some clever lyrics but dissapoints, kind of an in your face to Kim. \\"Hailie's Song\\" expresses his love to his daughter, I know he wants to tell Hailie he loves her but I think he can do better than this. \\"Steve Berman\\" the last skit on the album, very funny (hey no Ken Kaniff skit!). D12 shows up on the next track and drops some great verses and \\"When the Music Stops\\" is one of the best on the album. \\"Say What you Say\\" is another diss song toward Jermaine Dupri, Dre and Em tag team, kind of a weak diss. In the next track \\"'Till I Collaspe\\" Nate Dogg does and excellent chorus and Slimraps great. This song says he won't stop rapping till he collaspes. The album ending is weak. \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" and \\"Curtains Close\\" aren't the way to end an album. You might as well just turn it off after \\"'Till I Collaspe.\\" <br /> <br />Eminem does not dissapoint with his best album and only a few weak tracks. <br /> <br />Favorites(in order): <br />Sing For the Moment <br />Without Me <br />When the Music Stops <br />Cleanin' Out My Closet <br />Business <br /> <br />-Kyle Walker
B0006GAO3G|5.0|Barry Sonnenfeld helmed this, the best adaptation of any Elmore Leonard work to-date. The film is fast and funny, as it lampoons goombahs and La-La land with equal abandon. Players are all in top form, with Dennis Farina a stand-out as a disgruntled mobster who gets on Chili's bad side. Look for a pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini as a hapless bodyguard.
B00004T9UF|4.0|The second album in the Slim Shady collection is an awesome album and definately one of the best of all time. <br /> <br />Standard Eminem PSA. Starts of with \\"Kill You\\" a sick song in the end wich he apologizes to all women and says he was just kidding, with clever lyrics and a good chorus it's an okay opener. The next song features Dido doing the chorus and Eminem kicks 4 great verses. He talks about \\"Stan\\" a crazy Eminem fan writing letters to Eminem. Excellent track with this one. \\"Paul\\" (nothing new here), is another skit. \\"Who Knew\\" is a great track. Eminem kicks some great lyrics and a good beat for this one make this album great so far. \\"Steve Berman\\" kind of funny. <br /> <br />The next two tracks are 2 of Eminems best of all time. \\"The Way I Am\\" is an awesome song that Eminem uses to express his anger towoards the media. The next song that I'm sure every has heard is \\"The Real Slim Shady.\\" He must insult more celebrities in this song than any other. Great chorus and fantastic rhymes make this one of Slim Shady's best. \\"Remeber Me\\" is an annoying track that definately dissapoints after the great song's so far. The sick song \\"I'm Back\\" has a great beat and some clever lyrics, it makes up for \\"Remeber Me.\\" The next song has everything that makes Eminem great. Anger, great lyrics, incredible beat. \\"Marshall Mathers\\" is one of the best on the album.  <br /> <br />Another stupid \\"Ken Kaniff\\" skit. \\"Drug Ballad\\" has some good verses but overall it's not so good. Another anger song \\"Amityville\\" comes up a little short too me although most people like it. The next star stunted song \\"B*tch Please II\\" features Xhibit, Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre. Slim, Snoop, and Dres verses are great. Nate Dogg does an awesome chorus. Xhibit comes up a little short of the rest on this one.  <br /> <br />The most controversial track Eminem has ever made \\"Kim\\" is next on the album, details him killing her after she cheats on him. This song is a little too much for me. \\"Under the Influence\\" (feat. D12) is okay, Kuniva's verse is the best. \\"Criminal\\" is a good song but I think he could have done something better for a closer. <br /> <br />Overall this album does not come up short. Great tracks all the way through make it very listenable. <br /> <br />Favorites(in order): <br />The Real Slim Shady <br />The Way I Am <br />Marshall Mathers <br />Who Knew <br />Stan <br /> <br />-Kyle Walker
6305263248|5.0|Late director John Frankenheimer takes a boilerplate idea and milks it for all its worth, creating a tight, pounding thriller. Casting and performances are solid, but this truly is a director's picture, with Frankenheimer's keen sense of pacing and flavorful European locations contributing to an edge-of-your-seat experience.
B00006RJHG|4.0|This is a great little thriller! Besides having such great talent as Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, and Andrea Martin, it has a creepiness all its own. Not overly bloody this movie, leaves a lot to the imagination, which is what makes it creepy. Watch this one with all your doors and windows locked.
B00003CXA3|5.0|Gene Hackman's electrifying performance as Popeye Doyle won him an Oscar and transformed him from supporting player to star. Shot verit&eacute;-style by William Friedkin, this spellbinding movie evokes the slightly fraying quality of New York thirty years ago, when a fiscal crisis loomed. This only adds to the grit and edginess of this intense film, without question one of the best cop movies ever.
B000002MFN|5.0|The first album released under Madonna's Maverick label, 1992's \\"Erotica\\" hit #2 on The Billboard 200 and contained six hit singles. The album, produced by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Andre Betts, spent over a year on the US charts. The title track peaked #3 on The Billboard Hot 100 and was followed by 3 more US top 40 hits: \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" (#7), \\"Bad Girl\\" (#36) and \\"Rain\\" (#14). Some singles were only released in select territories. \\"Fever\\" was issued in Europe and climbed to #6 in the UK, while \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" hit #15 in Australia. Erotica has sold 2 million copies in America since its release, and a total of 6 million worldwide.     1. \\"Erotica\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Fever\\" (10/10)  3. \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Where Life Begins\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Bad Girl\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Waiting\\" (10/10)  8. \\"Thief Of Hearts\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Words\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Rain\\" (10/10)  11. \\"Why's It So Hard\\" (10/10)  12. \\"In This Life\\" (10/10)  13. \\"Secret Garden\\" (10/10)    \\"Erotica\\" is not a bad album at all. I have grown to love and appriciate Madonna's honesty when it comes to her personal life. This album is not all about sex. The album's opener, \\"Erotica\\", is excellent, and definately one of the album's best. \\"Fever\\" is good, but I prefer the video version. \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is a good song. Madonna sounds alot like Kylie. \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" is definately the album's best moment, and certainly one of Madonna's best singles. \\"Where Life Begins\\" spices things up a bit more, whereas \\"Bad Girl\\" is definately one of Madonna's best ballads. \\"Waiting\\" is my fave unreleased track. Produced by Andre Betts, it's quite different to anything Madonna has ever done before. \\"Thief Of Hearts\\" and \\"Words\\" are also absolutely brilliant songs, and \\"Rain\\" is another beautiful ballad. \\"Why's It So Hard\\" and \\"In This Life\\" see Madonna praying for peace and love, and \\"Secret Garden\\" closes the album brilliantly. Please note the song \\"Did You Do It\\", is only available on the dirty version,but you will be better without this track anyway. Madonna doesn't sing that much. Erotica is definately recommended.    My top three \\"Erotica\\" pics:-  3) Waiting  2) Erotica  1) Deeper And Deeper
B000002KJQ|2.0|I'm sure most Classic Rock radio listeners know at least two or three cuts from this album, and in my opinion, the rest of the album is as good as or better than any of the singles from it. I have to agree with the reviewers who are panning this CD only because of the horrible re-mixes.  I wore out a few copies of this album on vinyl and cassette back in the day, but if I sell my copy of the CD, it can be labeled \\"Played Only Once!\\"   I'll wait for the re-release of the original mix, hoping there will be one.
B000002N3J|5.0|One of the first albums of its kind, Madonna's 1995 ballads collection \\"Something To Remember\\" gathered her most notable down tempo numbers from her career. Some tracks on the album, including \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" and \\"I'll Remember,\\" were making their first appearance on a Madonna set. Three new songs were recorded for the album including a cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You,\\" a collaboration with Massive Attack. Two other new tracks, \\"You'll See\\" and \\"One More Chance,\\" both written and produced with David Foster, rounded out the album. \\"Something To Remember\\" peaked at #6 in the US and #1 in Australia. It achieved top five status in most other countries. \\"Something To Remember\\" has sold 3 million copies in the US alone, but another 10 million internationally which makes 13 million worldwide. <br /> <br />1. \\"I Want You\\" (10/10) <br />2. \\"I'll Remember\\" (10/10) <br />3. \\"Take A Bow\\" (10/10) <br />4. \\"You'll See\\" (10/10) <br />5. \\"Crazy For You\\" (10/10) <br />6. \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" (10/10) <br />7. \\"Live To Tell\\" (10/10) <br />8. \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (10/10) <br />9. \\"Something To Remember\\" (10/10) <br />10. \\"Forbidden Love\\" (9/10) <br />11. \\"One More Chance\\" (10/10) <br />12. \\"Rain\\" (10/10) <br />13. \\"Oh Father\\" (10/10) <br />14. \\"I Want You\\" [Orchestral Version] (10/10) <br /> <br />\\"Something To Remember\\" is a brilliant collection of Madonna's finest slow-jams. Most artists cannot pull ballad collections off, but Madonna does it with ease. If I've already given my thoughts on a song elsewhere, I will give their American chart positions instead. If I have reviewed a song already and it was not even a single, I'll note that song at the end of my review. \\"I Want You\\" is a brilliant track. It's definately one of the album's best tracks. \\"I'll Remember\\" is an excellent Madonna track, which got #2 stateside and spent longer than 6 months on the Billboard Chart. \\"Take A Bow\\" (#1) can be found on \\"Bedtime Stories\\". \\"You'll See\\" is one ofthe new tracks. It's brilliant and got #6 in the US. \\"Crazy For You\\" (#1) can be found on \\"The Immaculate Collection\\". \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" is excellent, from the film A League Of It's Own. It got #1 in America. \\"Live To Tell\\" (#1) can be found on \\"True Blue\\" and \\"The Immaculate Collection\\". \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (#78) can be found on \\"Like A Virgin\\", but was not released as a single until this album's success. \\"One More Chance\\" is a great acoustic track, which wasn't released as a single in the US, but got #11 in the UK. \\"Rain\\" (#14) can be found on \\"Erotica\\", and \\"Oh Father\\" (#20) can be found on \\"Like A Prayer\\". The Orchestral Version of \\"I Want You\\" is also good, but this track should've been \\"Bad Girl\\" instead. \\"Something To Remember\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\" were not released as singles, and can be found on my reviews for \\"I'm Breathless\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories\\", respectively. I totally recommend this album to any Madonna fans. <br /> <br />My top three \\"Something To Remember\\" pics:-  <br />3) Oh Father <br />2) Live To Tell <br />1) Take A Bow
0141301104|4.0|I bought this book as a gift for a pre-teen and she loved it.  Although this book is not the writer's (Roald Dahl's) best it should be considered very much.  She found it imaginative and very sweet.
B000002MUW|5.0|Collecting a gaggle of producers (Babyface, Nellee Hooper, Dallas Austin and Dave \\"Jam\\" Hall), Madonna turned out her sixth studio album in the fall of 1994. The album was immediately greeted warmly on the charts, with its first single, \\"Secret,\\" reaching #3 in the US. The album's second release, \\"Take A Bow,\\" became her biggest US hit, spending 7 weeks at #1 in the spring of 1995. Later that year, Madonna won the best female video trophy for \\"Take A Bow\\" at the MTV Video Music Awards. \\"Bedtime Story\\" (#42) and \\"Human Nature\\" (#46) were the third and fourth singles from \\"Stories\\" and were the first ever Madonna singles to not chart in the Top 40! But in the UK the singles hit #4 and #8 respectively, making the singles bigger. In the US, the album hit #3 and sold over 2 million units, worldwide it has sold 7 million, and garnered a Grammy nomination for best pop album.     1. \\"Survival\\" (10/10)  2. \\"Secret\\" (10/10)  3. \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\" (10/10)  4. \\"Don't Stop\\" (10/10)  5. \\"Inside Of Me\\" (10/10)  6. \\"Human Nature\\" (10/10)  7. \\"Forbidden Love\\" (9/10)  8. \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\" (10/10)  9. \\"Sanctuary\\" (10/10)  10. \\"Bedtime Story\\" (10/10)  11. \\"Take A Bow\\" (10/10)    \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is definately my second favourite Madonna album behind \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\". The opening track, \\"Survival\\", is absolutely brilliant and really shows off Madonna's R'n'B talents. \\"Secret\\" is definately one of my fave singles that Madonna has ever put out. The next track is \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\". Madonna shows off her R'n'B talents even more. \\"Don't Stop\\" is yet another brilliant track. Madonna sounds excellent! \\"Inside Of Me\\" is my fave song. I love how Madonna uses her breathing like an instrument. It's about her mother's death. The brilliant single \\"Human Nature\\" follows, and then the next track, \\"Forbidden Love\\", is the only track I've given 9/10. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just not as good as the other songs. The beautiful ballads \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\" and \\"Take A Bow\\" are also excellent, whereas \\"Sanctuary\\" and the single \\"Bedtime Story\\" add a bit of mystery to the album. I completely recommend this album to Madonna fans.     My top three \\"Bedtime Story\\" pics:-  3) Survival  2) Inside Of Me  1) Take A Bow
0312979479|5.0|although some will say that Agatha Christie's 'Murder on the Orient Express' or 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' is her best work, I along with many others in her fan base say it is this book also know as 'Ten Little Indians.'  Imagine ten strangers stranded on an isolated island and all ten are murdered, but by who?  This books is both suspenseful and imaginative and contains many red herrings that lead the reader to a shocking ending.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|This album is simply the most moving, heart wrenching, soulful, brilliant musical experience I have had in ages. The music, the lyrics, they speak to people in ways that a lot of music just doesn't do any more. I love music and I hear a lot of songs I like but I can not remember the last time I connected with an entire album and felt as entirely captivated as Back to Bedlam makes me feel. The first time I heard You're Beautiful.. I can not even describe what an impact it had. I was so enthralled that I really failed to hear the rest of the album even though I listened.  <br /> <br />I am so accustomed to hearing an album with one or two really good sets of music while the rest fail to live up to standard those set that I really just didn't hear what I was listening to until later and I was pleasantly shocked to find that each song on this album is just as stunningly vibrant, heartfelt, and well written as the first one I heard, even the more lively tunes have an underlying story.  <br /> <br />I once read a description of modern day bards as: <br />\\"Singers, musicians, storytellers, poets - anyone whose art is more than mere entertainment. Whose performance captures your imagination, making you forget you are being performed to, that has that touch of magic you can't quite describe. They are the true modern day bards.\\"  <br /> <br />/Salute James and Back to Bedlam. This album demonstrates that you have that touch of indescribable magic, a true bard like yourself is a rare and treasured find in today's era.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Loved this movie.  Went in not knowing what to expect and left a very happy movie goer.  This flick has it all, Comedy, Drama, Action, Spirituality.  Most memorable scenes are the Fat Lady chasing Sing and then the ulitimate battle between Helen of Troy, Paris & The Beast.  Great special effects and wild imagery. Have watched it multiple times, since then and it keeps getting better.  Liked it so much, purchased Shaolin Soccer (which pales in comparison).  Have highly recommended it to others.  My favorite movie of last year.
B000001GXJ|5.0|the Magical Combination of Cappuccilli, Ghairov and Carreras which was employed in the mid 70's often by La Scala has, unfortunatley, left little recorded legacy behind.  Unlike the Pavarotti/ Sutherland or Milnes/ domingo, thee artists were less utilized.  Their Don Carlos with Karajan was a bit of a bore, with Carreras and Cappuccilli already sounding tired at times. Listen to this Boccanegra (and alternatley the Forza Del Destino video by the Bel Canto society) to  discover why this pairing thrilled so many .<br /><br />  Cappuccilli, who doesn't have the most pliant or beautiful voice, was nevertheless an incredible vocal actor who could blast through the toughest of Verdi's works.  In his prime, he lends Boccanegra a power and gruff beauty, and fills out the lines with incredible breath control.<br /><br />  Ghiaurov's Bass-Baritone, black as death, is always perfect.  His melancholy, slighly nasal tone, brings forth shadows of his King Phillip<br /><br />  Mirella Freni brings what she always brings to an operatic recording.  She has a beautiful, warm, dark voice, that retains the control of a lyric soprano.  Her top is huge and supple and, in her youthful prime here, she can harly have been wanted to sound better.<br /><br />  Carreras is a very different singer than the one you might associate with his name.  The foggy top notes of the '80's are not yet in evidence (nor is the hakneyed and desperate phrasing).  The wobble of the 90's is nowhere.  This is the Carreras that was, for  5 years or so, the most popular and exciting of the worlds tenors.  His tone is bright and his top has a ring and plangent spinto that Domingo could never approach (of course I love Domingo and recognize that he has sung excellently for 40 years to Carreras's 10.)  Yet it is worth the price of the Cd to hear this exquisite Carreras singing.<br /><br />  Jose Van Dam is a surprizingly high-class paolo.  Jose is in the same great form that produced his legendary Escamillio just 2 years previously with Domingo.<br /><br />  Verdi's political masterpiece speaks for itself.  It is a touching story, and although it is complex it is not impossible to follow.  There are no toe tapping numbers, but the musical standard is the greatest in the  world.<br /><br /> I highly reccommend this set.previously with Domingo.   <br />      Verdi's political masterpiece speaks for itself.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Chrisitan Bale the best Batman ever. Christopher Nolan has done a great job in re-inventing Batman with an origin story with David Goyer. Michael Caine as the Alfred the trusted butler is the best & only father figure for Bruce Wayne. Gordon as the cop trying to fight corruption. Cilian Murphy played the very freightening SCARECROW. <br /> <br />One waits for when Batman will come on screen which is after the 1 hr mark. But when he is on the screen the scary voice takes control. With a good ending setting up for the upcoming sequel is very interesting.  <br /> <br />Overall, This year's best Superhero movie ever. You have to get the DVD of this movie to add to your collection. <br /> <br />\\"THE DARK KNIGHT REIGNS\\"
B000002MUQ|2.0|1995 marked two milestones for Van Halen. It marked the 10th anniversary of original lead singer David Lee Roth's departure (firing?) from the band. It was also their last year (until 2004) with his replacement, Sammy Hagar. The group's final album with the red rocker, \\"Balance\\", was released. It proved to be a death knell for the second chapter of the group's career. Though it entered the album charts at number one, \\"Balance\\" is not a good album. Personal problems had overtaken their creative powers, thus meaning their hearts were not into it.<br /><br />The album did yield two very minor hits, \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" and \\"Not Enough\\". These are the only truly good tracks on the album. \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" is actually my third favorite Van Halen song of all time. \\"Not Enough is nice tender ballad with some great piano work. The rest of the album is a downer. Some tracks (\\"The Seventh Seal\\", \\"Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)\\") start off promising, but ultimately disappoint. \\"Amsterdam\\" has some of the worst lyrics of any Van Halen songs, while \\"Bog Fat Money\\" is the kind of mindless filler that you'd expect on any VH album. The only other good track besides the two singles is the mellow ballad \\"Take Me Back (Deja Vu)\\". There's some great acoustic work on this one, and Sammy's vocals are on the money.<br /><br />So, \\"Balance\\" is not a good album. Other than three great tracks, it's not an album I'd recommend. Download the three new tracks.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|This was a very enjoyable time waster. The characters were likable (particularly Zahn's Giordino (btw I thinks it's pronounced jor-dino not gee-or-dino)) the cinamatography superb, the dialog passable and the plot diverting. This could develop into a great franchise. I did find the 007ish soundtrack idiom (the waa-waa muted brass was not subtle) a little much.<br /><br />Recommended for your collection.<br /><br />BTW the earlier poster needs to lighten up: yes there were some not so subtle political messages, but these are Hollywood people. Pollitically they are slow but likeable children. The same thing that gives them their imaginative and creative abilities prevents them from having a lick of sense in other areas. Just take it with a grain of salt. Say it with me: \\"It's just a movie\\".
B000002LIR|5.0|Rod Stewart is one of the most successful artists in rock history. He is also one of its most diverse. Over the years, Rod has experimented with everything from folk to hard rock to disco to even modern R&B/hip-hop. In 1990, the four disc boxed set \\"Storyteller\\" was released to commemorate his first 25 years as a musician. Well, as we know, Rod has released quite a bit of work since then, most of it worth owning. So, how does \\"Storyteller\\" hold for a 15 year old compilation? Here are the positives and negatives.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-If you want all the best from Rod's first 25 years, than this collection covers the entire spectrum. All of the hits from that period, inlcuding \\"Maggie May\\", \\"Tonight's The Night\\", \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\\", \\"Young Turks\\", \\"Some Guys Have All The Luck\\" and \\"Forever Young\\", to name a few, are all on here.<br /><br />-As with all boxed sets, there's a wealth of underrated gems and rarities on here. The entire first disc is filled with nothing but them!<br /><br />-All the songs sound great.<br /><br />-The liner notes, with an introduction by Robert Palmer and commentaries on each song by Rod himself, plus some nice photos, is excellent.<br /><br />-Is fairly easy to locate.<br /><br />-There's a great (then) new version of \\"I Don't Wanna Talk About It\\" only available here.<br /><br />-It's available for about $ 50.00. That may seem expensive, but considering most boxed set can exceed $ 80.00, you get a pretty darn good deal.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-It doesn't contain all the wonderful stuff he did after 1990. So you won't find hit singles like \\"Rhythm Of My Heart\\", \\"The Motown Song\\" and \\"Have I Told You Lately\\" as well as other great stuff on here. However, since this collection was released before all that, it can't really be considered a negative as it was out of the compilers' jurisdiction.<br /><br />-\\"I Was Only Joking\\" is edited. You should never put edited versions on a boxed set.<br /><br />Overall, I'd definitely recommend this boxed set. It is an excellent representation of Rod's best years. For the other excellent pso - 1990 material, download them.an excellent representation of Rod's best years. For the other excellent pso - 1990 material, download them.

Blended with different musical genre with clean and death metal vocals.... This is something for people who are opened minded and who seek to challenge the musical bounderies.... Melodic and heavy plus epic songs more than 10 mins....It is a feast for me cause I love long structured songs....I consider Opeth to be Prog Death Metal!! I love it!!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I was just listening to Appetite for Destruction and oh my god, <br />it's terrible. All the songs on that album are just mean, dirty <br />sexy, weak, and bad. There are only a few good songs on that album. That's why in my opinion, this is GNR's only good album. <br />I'm glad they did this because I ain't a very huge GNR fan. <br />Anyway, other than that, I think this is a very great CD with <br />only a few weak tracks and no bad words. Plus on AFD and other <br />GNR albums, they have bad words. This CD has all the big hits <br />from GNR containing Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, <br />Patience, Paradise City, Civil War, You Could Be Mine, November <br />Rain, & Live and Let Die. If you are a fan to GNR, just own <br />this, not any other GNR albums. Thanks.
006441034X|5.0|I love this book more than any other I have ever had the pleasure to read. I cannot describe in words or shades of color the emmense joy and comfort I take in this book. But, I will list my top five favorite Diana Wynne Jones books that are in some way engendered in the same manner as \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" in order to help those who are understandibly frustrated by the end of the book; to which I direct your attention to the 'sequel' \\"Castle In the Air\\" as well as the titles bellow:<br /><br />  (1) Fire and Hemlock<br /><br />  (2) Dark Lord of Derkholm (the sequel being Year of the Griffin<br /><br />  (3) Time of the Ghost<br /><br />  (4) Hexwood<br /><br />  (5) The Lives of Christopher Chant
B000002572|4.0|This is a good album, if you hear More Than a Feeling, Peace of <br />Mind, Foreplay, & Smokin' on the radio, then you must need this <br />cd. Recommended.
B000002UCN|4.0|This album is from 1976 and there are no songs from 80's. <br />First 7 tracks came from Beatles albums and I think it is the best of Harrison in Beatles period. <br />The other tracks from Harrison solo albums are good, but fragmented. There are some songs which missed this best of. <br />Reason is that this was first released od LP format.
B0006L16N8|4.0|My daugher got me to listen to Coldplay and though I don't think I would have picked this up, I loved it!  Great melodies and great sound.  Lyrics not so great but I don't think that matters in pop music.  We also liked The Killers, but I don't know which album.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This 2cd is great. It contains most singles from 1967-70 period. <br />There are some songs which missed on this 2cd, but I think it is real best of and this is best way for beginners. <br />There is 1962-66 Red album which I recomended too.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Superb effort. May be not their best but still a worthy acquisition for a true Parsons fan. After buying the album, I did not play it for a few months. The main reasons being I did not want to get disappointed and was waiting for the right \\"mood\\" to sample their new album. After all, if may put it  <br />this way, an Alan Parsons album doesn't happen every day. But when I tried it, frankly I was a bit disappointed. But wait, that's not all. Little by little it grows on you. It's not as \\"catchy\\" as \\"The Time Machine\\". So you true Parsons fans, do not despair. Reserve judgment till a few more hearings.  <br />In my opinion following would be the rating of the 14 Project/Parsons offerings: <br /> <br />1. Tales... <br />2. On Air <br />3. Turn of a Friendly Card <br />4. Eye in the Sky <br />5. Ammonia Avenue <br />6. A Valid Path <br />7. I Robot <br />8. Stereotomy  <br />9. Eve <br />10. Pyramid <br />11. Try Anything Once <br />12. Vulture Culture <br />13. Time Machine <br />14. Gaudi <br /> <br />The two Eric Woolfson albums Freudiana and More Tales..., I would place them some where in the bottom half of the above list. <br />Lastly, A Valid Path is a very \\"different\\" output than their earlier albums.  <br />
B000002UYZ|5.0|This 2cd is great. It contains most singles from 1962-66 period. <br />There are some songs which missed on this 2cd (some songs from Revolver), but I think it is real best of and this is best way for beginners. <br />There is 1967-70 Blue album which I recomended too.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I bought this movie and was very skeptical. I thought this movie would be more of a joke than a well put together film. I am disappointed I never went to support it in theaters for it is a very very good film. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a good adventure movie with a great element of comedy. Check this movie out and you will not be disappointed! <br /> <br />On another note the soundtrack is definitely worth checking out as well.
B000002IHD|5.0|This is for me the best soul album ever. <br />All songs are beautiful, contains true soul arrangements without  <br />frequent and disruptive background vocals. <br />Redding is in top form. His songs like Respect or I've Been Loving You Too Long are great and his covers like Satisfaction or Down in the walley too. <br />This is essential music for every soul fans. <br />Note: I have this album on mono.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Burn sucks me in from the opening riff and holds my attention all the way to the end. Very few guitarists excite me the way Ritchie Blackmore does. I mean, the guy is mesmerizing. Such phrasing. And speed. A dash of medieval here, a smidgeon of showboating there and -- viola! -- you've got a certified rock god on your hands. <br /> <br />On Burn, DP's eight CD, you get to enjoy a classic line-up that includes Blackmore, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale, who has a set of pipes on him that just won't quit. To say he's a powerful singer is putting it mildly. <br /> <br />Rhino's remastering is astounding. Every instrument (especially the drums, keyboards and guitar) jump out of the speakers with crystal clarity. This CD sounds fresher and cleaner than any CD released today. In fact, listening to this Rhino remaster is like hearing Burn for the first time -- which is saying a lot because I remember actually hearing it for the first time when it was released in 1974. As a 14-year-old kid in love with rock music, it made quite an impression. <br /> <br />But it's making an even bigger impression on me now because I have 30 years of maturity and experience with other bands under my belt (which seems to be slightly larger than it was in the Seventies, but that's another story). Deep Purple is one of a handful of bands that still excite the hell out of me. No band today can hold a candle to Blackmore-era Deep Purple. <br /> <br />Which is the main reason why Burn is in my collection and ought to be in yours. This is some of the most electrifying music ever recorded, folks. Thanks to Rhino, it sounds better than it ever did.  <br /> <br />In addition to the title track, I really enjoy \\"Might Just Take Your Life\\" and, of course, the awesome \\"Mistreated,\\" one of Blackmore's coolest riffs. Combined with Coverdale's powerful voice, this could be one of rock music's most blistering tracks. <br /> <br />Everything about the Rhino-remastered Burn is first-rate.This is one of my all-time favorite bands and one of my all-time favorite of their albums. I can't recommend Burn highly enough.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I dont see why theres such a low rating for this album.. 3 and a half stars? come on.. youre not giving it a chance. <br /> <br />1. Root of All Evil - a great opener.. the second pre-chorus remains as one of the most intense vocal performances ever, this song is, in case you dont know, the third part of the glass prison. <br /> <br />2. Answer lies within - in images and words fashion, the softest song second. its a very quiet ballad-type song, not bad, but easily the 'worst' on here <br /> <br />3. These Walls - I didnt like it too much at first, ill admit, but this song has grown on me.. this song's hook is quite good and has an almost hypnotic feel to it.. very emotional <br /> <br />4. I walk beside you - as everyone has said.. sounds like a U2 song, but you have to admit, its pretty good.. almost.. too happy though <br /> <br />5. Panic Attack - things get heavier and better from here. Panic attack feels like something that could have been on Train of Thought.. it begins with john myung's bass solo, when i saw them live, this song was crazy.. ill admit there isnt much feeling behind the 'heaviness' but its still solid <br /> <br />6. Never Enough - took a while to grow on me.. not much to say.. not bad though <br /> <br />7 - Sacraficed sons - i had to give this one a chance.. starts with a creepy piano riff, and goes into a really slow, emotional-style set of verses. it's chorus is also great. after a long, but very good (unlike some of Dream theater's) instrumental section, it returns to the final verse, which is something worth listening to due to labrie's intense singing and the pounding guitar riff backed by Portnoy's drums.. a great ending, instead of DT's usual 'end with the chorus' style <br /> <br />8 - Octavarium - very strange.. if youre expecting another 'a change in seasons', look elsewhere.. which is what is great.. its unique. after a very long intro (Pink Floyd, anyone?) it goes to a simple section on the acoustic guitar.. it starts with what sounds like an Fminor chord.. then a very cool flute riff.. after this, John switches to a 12 string acoustic for the first 'section' featuring Labrie's chilling vocals.. things take a much 'happier' turn for the second section, despite it being more serious, with Myung's funk bassline. <br /> <br />-After this, things get more distorted, and heavy.. in the third section 'Full Circle' (written by Portnoy) things get strange.. the lyrics consist of a bunch of pop culuture references strung together with a strange chorus.. finally, the song's climax comes.. beginning with an almost spoken-style set of lyrics.. things eventually build up to one of the strangest climaxes everywhere.. crazy, pounding rhythms and James screaming 'Trapped Inside this Octavarium'. as strange as it might be, its very unique.. things slow down for the fifth section.. a quick bit of singing then it fades with an emotional guitar solo <br /> <br />anyway.. im saying give this album a chance.. its quite good.. it might take a bit to get used to though
B000058T5E|5.0|I've heard this album now about 6 times.  Each time it gets better.  This is the only album I've heard in years that I enjoy listening to the whole album straight through.  In this age of digital, I find that the sounds can be too seperated for my taste.  I prefer listening to this album through my stero system (not earphones) with the speakers close together.  This blends the sound better for me.  Under these conditons this is a really spritual experience.  I also really appreciate how the album is seemingly designed to be listened to from beginning to end.  By the end I always feel better and more relaxed.
0393061310|5.0|Whenever I argue against racism, I am asked, \\"Well, then, why DID Eurpeans colonize Africa and Australia and the Americans, instead of the other way around?\\"  I always knew there were good answers but couldn't quite explain what they were.  Though I know the danger in feeling that something must be intuitively correct, that is exactly what I felt on reading this book.  The answers presented make sense, and seem very well supported by facts.  Without doing the research myself, it is tough to tell - but this book has made me quite confident in my previously only gut beliefs that all people are basically equal.  Read this book to learn, and also to think.
B000001F9N|5.0|How do you follow up a monumental genre defining hit like `Love to love you baby'?<br /><br />The answer is with the gold certified `A love trilogy'. Full of everything that made disco; strings, horns, bass, rich percussion, and a sexy voice. Everything but the glittery disco ball.<br /><br />Opening cut `Try me' was loosely split into four sections; the breathy `Try me' with Donna's cooing hitting stratospheric notes and that distinctive guitar riff, `I know' sung in a slightly lower, sexier register, a wonderful musical bridge links to `We can make it' with a lovely simple keyboard bit and sung in her real voice before returning to falsetto on `Try me I know we can make it'. A charming multi style suite!<br /><br />Side 2 (on the original vinyl LP) opened with the 1 minute `Prelude to love', a breathy spoken piece with lush, dramatic strings.<br /><br />Next was the albums biggest hit, her cover of the Barry Manilow song `Could it be magic. This starts off with Donna singing in a lazy yearning version of her real voice. The strings are awesome, and there are lots of sensual moans and gasps. The final 1 and a half minutes is climatic with dreamy sounding backing vocals, magical keyboards and Donna's voice floating above it all. This song, along with `Try me' are still major crowd pleasers at her concerts.<br /><br />`Wasted' has a funky R&B feel, with Donna cooing in her falsetto to a melancholic musical backdrop replete with harps and sweeping cutting strings. The percussion on this song is really rich, tiny details that set the Summer/Moroder/Bellotte team apart from the others. The final 1 minute musical outro of the song is simply outstanding. Great keyboards.<br /><br />Closing is my favourite track. `Come with me'. Again, sung in her lazy, yearning voice. Very dreamy sounding and again, richly textured; guitars, horns, strings and excellent percussion. Great OO-OO-OO backing vocals. Very catchy upbeat song about desire.<br /><br />A magical, musical journey into disco from the queen which like the album photo will take you for a ride above the clouds.take you for a ride above the clouds.
0060512806|5.0|The first time I read this book, I was angry that I had to sleep - it was that absorbing.  A rich, complex tail that plays to many subtle interests.  It's like the Simpsons but even smarter.  I have bought it to give to friends over and over, and I reread it regularly.
B000002NZO|5.0|Whether pre or post Gabriel, pre or post Hackett, this is remarkably overlooked as one of the real touchstones of the classic era of progressive art rock.  Guitarist Anthony Phillips, acknowledged by the other original members as the band leader, left after this recording due to serious bouts with depression and stage fright.<br /><br />Rock criticism has always had contempt for anything that was not completely proletariat.  3 chords and a gob of spit could get you a Village Voice rave.  Thus, anything high concept or classically influenced was lambasted as pretentious, pompous, or bombastic.  Sadly, they just don't make bands (or albums) like this anymore.  Don't miss it.

0140277447|3.0|I have studied Japanese war crimes a great deal; I consider myself almost an unofficial student of them.  I do not deny that they happened and I think it is sad that some people do.  Though I do think that people just need to give Japan a break; we've forgiven Germany, haven't we? <br /> <br />I read this book.  It was informative, though the author got way too emotional for me to consider it completely unbiased.  She made some claims that are untrue, but I will go into that later in this review. <br /> <br />However, I am tired of people saying that Chang's account is the best you will find.  Contrary to their claims, it is NOT.  \\"The Nanjing Massacre\\" by Honda Katsuichi is amazingly comprehensive; in fact, it goes into Japanese atrocities in China in general, not just in Nanjing.  Katsuichi, despite being Japanese, remains objective and does not hesitate to give details no matter how gruesome.  Unlike Chang's, his writing is not emotionally-charged and his bias questionable.   <br /> <br />Some of Chang's charges are untrue.  Japan has apologized numerous times for its WWII atrocities.  It paid reparations eventually; not in terms of money but in helping China build things.  Though she may not have intended it as such, her book could be taken as communist propaganda because it reiterates and even backs up China and Korea's false claims.  While Japan hasn't done much in terms of making it up to America, their debt to Asia is pretty much paid; the war crimes are now being exploited by communist nations who need a good enemy.  America has forgiven Japan, even after Bataan.  The Philippines have forgiven Japan, even after the rape of Manila. <br /> <br />I guess this is a good intro into the topic of the atrocities in Nanjing, but if you want to really learn about it in-depth, I'd read Katsuichi's book instead.  And, please, take her claims about Japan today with a grain of salt.
6302869390|5.0|A new version of this great film with lots of new extra material is to be released at the end of 2005! Re-mastered and re-edited. I'm gonna wait a couple of more months!
B0001CNRSE|3.0|This movie reminds me of Flashdance, which was much better! Jessica Alba is gorgeous & perky & that is her appeal. However, nothing about her dancing is all that impressive that people should so desperately want her in their music videos & the plot line is so vey cliche. The charcters are just too...done before & the movie overall was kind of boring. If you want a good movie about an inspiring dancer who overcomes obsticles then you must rent the classic Flashdance.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I thought I'd mention that the club/prom singer and the band that appears in the movie (they call them \\"The Raincoats\\") is in fact \\"Letters To Cleo\\" with Kay Hanley vocalist.  She went on to do the singing for Josie in \\"Josie and the Pussycats. <br />Note lots of good shots of the band under the closing credits. <br />Letters To Cleo has several CDs available on Amazon. <br />They also have songs on \\"The Craft\\"  \\"The Babysitters Club\\" and \\"Jawbreakers.\\"
B0009XT8YW|5.0|The 25th Anneversiry Edition is great. All remastered from the original tapes.And on The DVD side it was great that they included two videos from The Streisand Special One Voice which premiered on HBO in 1986.Both Duets are great \\"Guilty & What Kind of Fool\\" The 2nd Song Woman in Love is one of my favorites from the CD with next to promises the Club like song which i love. \\"Run Wild\\" is great and i lvoe the back upsinging by The Gibbs. Then \\"Life Story\\" is a great song with an upbeat club feel. And Make it like a memory is also great. Too bad there is only 9 songs but every second of each song is worth it too own. Only a limited wait for the new Cd cant wait the songs i heard so far are all great esspecially the video for \\"Stranger in a Strange land\\"15 out of 10 BEYOND EXCELLENT !
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I noticed this movie had so much hype. I am in agreement with Ebert's review, although I think this movie was worse than Ebert's rendiditon. I watched the whole movie through, and I have to say, I did not have one single laugh. I thought this movie was not at the very least funny. Unfortunately me and my friends did not share the same type of humour this movie apparently has. <br /> <br />Absolutely aweful.
B00005JNQA|5.0|Nicole Kidman IMO couldve had a shot at being nominated for an oscar had this film come out later in the year, maybe the globes will notice her for her amazing work in an amazing film, no doubt i will be getting this...
B000000YIQ|5.0|The freshness of this enchanting CD cut in a few hours is like a mirage. Beautiful and temporary while leaving an impact.<br />The motiff and location of the Wild West as the idea of Cowboy Rollins on the CD cover and the sense of wilderness felt in the pure uncluttered music reveals a spacious quality as the jagged flowing pointed playing of Rollins,accompanied here with a bass player and drummer makes a statement of clear distinct music. The sparseness and texture of the emptiness of a desert/LA in the 1950's, as distinct from the hustle of a New York or Chicago, serves as a backdrop to Rollins's music here while the choice of compositions was well intended as a return to nature and basic heartfelt playing.<br />A few swinging Cowboy Western style tunes with Lincoln County imagery, some compositions in the ballad form, even a dreamy Ellington cover of Solitude (lost and stranded in a desert?),with many alternate takes, makes this CD both a lengthy one, and a worthy piece of music somehow unique coming from a great sax player and this stripped down band.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon is bound to become a prototype of the nerd some of us had inside as we grew up through the eighties. He's shy and he's not really good looking, yet he insists on not being left out and contributing his \\"skills\\" to the cool things taking place around him.<br /><br />If you were not remotely the nerd type, chances are you may not feel this way about the movie (and even find it boring, as some viewers do), yet there's a good possibility that you will be amused by his remarks and the \\"silliness\\" of the world around him. Napoleon incarnates, in a brief and fun stint, innocence combined with a sense of adventure and desire for justice, and he does while he makes you laugh until it hurts.<br /><br />I've seen it three times now, and every time I enjoy it as much as the first time. By all means, an instant classic.
0375758992|5.0|I read this book over year ago and still think of it often.  It tells the not too often told story of growing up white in Africa plus deals with tragedy, alcoholism and mental illness.  A must read memoir.
B00001U03Q|5.0|Just a quick note to say that, although I am fairly familiar with Eric Clapton (being a child of the 70s & all), I had never heard \\"River of Tears\\" until I bought this CD. I believe it to be one of the most haunting & beautiful songs I've ever heard---it's just about perfect---lyrics, vocals & the beautiful background orchestration. Brought tears to my eyes. I don't need to analyze it; I'll just enjoy it! That's what music is for, after all!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I usually don't partake in exercises like writing online reviews. Especially for albums that already have over 1500 reviews but...after reading some of the garbage and laughable negativity directed towards this album, I figured what the hell, let's give it a shot. <br /> <br />In fact, let's just make a long story short.  This album is a masterpiece.  I've been a huge Radiohead fan for the last 13 years and have been fortunate enough to see them in concert a few times.  In all that time, and forgive the melodramatic tone here, there has been nothing that can compare to the first time I put this in my CD player as a college freshman in 1997.  The music is haunting, the songwriting is incredible.  What makes the songwriting so incredible is what a lot of reviewers seem to find so wrong...creating something challenging and thought provoking that the masses can relate to.  I think this is a good thing.  It's not like there is an Oprah Book Selection sticker stamped on the cover of Ok Computer like \\"The Corrections\\" by Franzen.  I mean we might as well start criticizing Van Gogh's art.  The fact that so many people have found this album amazing does not change the music that is on the CD.  It never will.  Over a decade ago I caught an in store performance that Radiohead put on in Minneapolis during the Creep days.  I doubt if you'll ever hear me criticize all of those \\"Bends\\" bandwagon jumpers. wink.  What will make this album great above all else is the societal and pre Y2K timing of it's release.  It is a soundtrack to what life was like then, the oncoming of souless technology and the loneliness that can cause in our society. <br /> <br />Sorry for the minute outburst, it's hard to see something as great as OK Computer being ripped by 20 year old indie hipsters who were in elementary school enjoying recess when this album came out.  I'll be sure to look around the site for your backlashes against Interpol in 2003, your Rapture backlashes in 2004, and maybe there's some Beatle album hostility from the 70s too.  The real treat will be the Arcade Fire reviews next year.  Cheers
B000005RXD|5.0|I got this when it came out and after reading the great open-minded reviews and the sad idiots that would rather listen to \\"Unmasked\\", I had to add my 3 Bucks a gallon! (time point reference) I remember cranking this with the headphones and getting the same chills I got when I was a boy and heard The Stones' \\" Let It Bleed\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\" or more closely Alice Cooper's WAY over-looked \\"Last Temptation\\" CD, and was propelled into that zone that all musicians hit when an album changed their life! The was my KISS? For the first time, they did what they always set out to do, they scared the B-Jesus outta me! This collection left me wanting more and more! I think I may have listen to it about 15 times that day. Typical losers I played it for gave the typical, \\"It's OK, I guess!\\" or who are they trying to sound like? Trying to keep this review \\"G\\" rated is very hard at this point! I was like. \\"Are you deaf?\\"  If someone told me the next day an earthquake hit us in the northeast because of this incredible, bold masterpeice I was cranking day in and day out, I would say ...and? Gene was HATE! Paul took me to the Jungle and left me there in the dark and it began to RAIN on me hard! (That fit well!) I even liked the edgey ballad Paul wrote for his kid. I could have done without Bruce's song. Even today I crank it when I wanna sweat bullets. Brilliant!
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Over the span of their discography, Death cab for cutie's Musical style has not changed that much from album to album. Even having made the jump to a major label, the group manages to stay true to their original sound. Although this makes their music seem trite at times, They are still consistantly makeing good songs.  <br />    As for the move to Atlantic, you wouldn't even know it were it not the first thing on a \\"Death Cab\\" fans lips concerning the new album. \\"It sounds more produced\\" some will gripe. Anyone who thinks \\"Plans\\" is the groups first album that sounds produced needs to listen to \\"The Photo Album\\" again. You don't need to have been a die hard fan to know that this was an inevitable move for the group. And whats so wrong with a band wanting their music to be heard by an audience that an Independent label cannot reach.
B000000OAN|4.0|Queen's fourth album is probably their best.  It features the classic hits \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\", plus solid album tracks like \\"Death on Two Legs\\" and \\"Love of My Life\\".  But I don't really care for the epic \\"The Prophet's Song\\" (I may be in the minority there).  Still, this is a very good album overall.  The CD adds useless remixes of \\"I'm in Love With My Car\\" and \\"You're My Best Friend\\", which sound almost identical to the original versions.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Unlike Blackwater Park(the only other Opeth cd i own)which has songs that switch from soft to heavy to soft to heavy, Damnation is 100% all soft, as in NOT HEAVY AT ALL. depressing lyrics, atmospheric sounds, depressing singing, acoustic guitar work, and slow and steady drumming are all acurate descriptions of what Damnation is all about. even though i was disapointed at first when i realized Damnation was NOT HEAVY AT ALL it began to grow on me anyways and now i appreciate the softer more melodic side of Opeth instead of only looking at it as intermition between heavy parts. and i guess this is why Opeth is one of the best bands out there, because Opeth can play their gentle stuff just as well as their death metal stuff. so go ahead and buy this cd. and even though Damnation is NOT HEAVY AT ALL it is still a great demontration that Opeth can make good music without the adition of death metal.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|Sound quality A+ <br />Song collection A+ <br />Satisfaction A+ <br />Certified Perfection.
B0007P3582|1.0|we've heard all of this once why would we wanna hear it all again on his 2nd CD with worse songs? just a thought
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album was recommended to me by a friend more involved in the musical scene than I. I decided to check it out on Amazon and immediately fell in love with it. As soon as I saw the title, I knew that Sufjan had done his homework. The list of tracks reads like a natural history of Illinois. I think my favorite title is \\"Casimir Pulaski Day,\\" in honor of the Chicagoland tradition of giving a day off for an unknown Polish general who fought in the Revolutionary War, but there are many other great titles on this CD.  <br /> <br />Of course, an album cannot be judged by its titles alone, and the songs themselves meet expectations. The aforementioned song is a beautifully sad one, capturing the ephemeral moments of joy remembered after losing someone to cancer. \\"Decator, or Round of Applause for Our Stepmom\\" is particularly dear to my heart, as its easy-flowing style and topic both remind me of my own life.  <br /> <br />Stay alert when you're listening to this CD. Keep the track listing next to you because there are a lot of seconds-long tracks which contain jokes. They can easily be missed if you're not listening for them specifically and they endow the CD with a certain flair that makes it that much more Illinoise. I strongly recommend this CD for anyone from Illinois, as it will be immediately appreciated, and anyone coming to Illinois, as it will ready you for this great lackluster state (that I so love) in the middle of the country.

Youll never get lost or bogged down because everything is explained, you arent forced to just accept it. The only critism I have is some of the code exersizes are a little complicated. The pool puzzels in particular are too difficult to be worth trying to figure out. Im half done with the book, and I cannot say its made me a java programmer yet, but at least I have a good idea of whats going on.
B000000WCA|5.0|I bought this album at a garage sale 4 years ago and I now love the Spice Girls!  Even when they were on the scene about 8 or 9 years ago, they're still an awesome girl group.  Here is what I thought of all the songs on Spice: <br /> <br />1) Wannabe- 10/10.  My favorite song!  I have to belt it out whenever I hear it. <br />  <br />2) Say You'll Be There- 9/10.  I love this one. <br /> <br />3) 2 Become 1- 8/10.  A very slow song, but still good. <br /> <br />4) Love Thing- 10/10.  My 2nd favorite song. <br /> <br />5) Last Time Lover- 8/10. I like this song. <br /> <br />6) Mama- 9/10. This song is really nice! <br /> <br />7) Who Do You Think You Are- 10/10.  Cool tune!   <br /> <br />8) Something Kinda Funny- 9/10. A little slow, but I like it! <br /> <br />9) Naked- 8/10. Slow and whispery, but decent. <br /> <br />10) If U Can't Dance- 10/10.  Fantastic song! <br /> <br />There were no songs below an 8/10 on this album!  I'm glad I bought it.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|I just saw this and am LIVID! I too spent FULL price on AMAZON.COM for all the seasons as they came out b-cuz I am the BIGGEST fan ever! It would have been nice to have a 'heads-up' on this complete series release. I might have waited. All my plastic boxes are coming apart also and the season 6 deal with HBO splitting it up really ticked me off!! [...] I am so sick of HBO taking advantage of the die hard fans and making these prices so HIGH all the time. And it sucks that because the bar is set so high NO WHERE else can you really find these discs any cheaper. I guess the only way I will get the collector's set is if I get it as a gift and my husband can't see the reasoning behind it since I already own them all. I REALLY REALLY WANT THIS! [...]
B000002BQK|4.0|Very good album, my favorite after \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\". My favorites are: My All, The Roof, Breakdown (One of her best songs ever), & Babydoll. Very mellow album, most consider it her best. A good buy. GO MC!
B00005B364|3.0|you'll probably buy this disc for the same reason i did - to hear \\"hocus pocus\\" again.  i can't blame you.  i listened to the entire disc and it's not bad at all - a bit odd here and there, but not bad at all.  i'll admitt this though, i'll probably play only \\"hocus pocus\\" 90% of the times i pull this disc out of the collection.  but it's worth it.  enjoy. <br />space puppy, out
B00007EDY5|2.0|This adapter is only for other low voltage Nikon flashes and won't allow you to use other higher voltage flashes such as Vivitar or any of the common smaller studio lights. For that buy an adapter from Wein.
0060005424|5.0|Lirael is fantastic, a book with believable characters and an apocolyptic plotline. Don't let the word Apocolypse bring you down, this book is as original as it gets. Created with drama and imagination, this whole series is poised to become a classic to sit alongside the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br />Read it before then, it's a true wonder to be sure.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is Truly The Greatest Hip-Hop album EVER made laides and gents along with Biggies \\"Ready to Die\\" and Pacs \\"All Eyez On Me\\" this is 110% REAL Hip-Hop from the soul you will never see another album like this from Nas again.Its a shame these days to see nas collaborating with \\"Lil Jon\\" \\"Busta Rhymes\\" \\"50 Cent\\" \\"Bobby Valentino\\" \\"Jermaine Durpi\\" \\"Cassidy\\" \\"Master P\\" & ECT.What a joke there are no more emcees and poets left in Hip-hip these days its pretty sad exept Common hes always been the TRUTH.Nuff said
0060528737|5.0|Generally, I despise the fantasy genre. I could never read The Lord of the Rings. The Abhorsen Trilogy has cured me it would seem. It has opened my eyes to the beauty and excitement of the genre. I congratulate Garth Nix on this world class novel and can't wait to read the rest of his books. <br /> <br />Please read Sabriel and Lirael as well.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is a great collection of Beach Boys songs.  So many great classics ranging from California Girls to Help Me Rhonda to God Only Knows to Kokomo and much more.  Fast or slow these Beach Boy harmonies sound true to my ears.<br /><br />There are a few songs not on here such as Little Saint Nick, Wendy, Sail On Sailor, and You're So Good To Me that possibly should be included instead of some of the lesser tunes.  However, this is a minor oversight.<br /><br />In contrast to the previous reviewer, this CD sounds great regardless of whether the tracks are mono or stereo recorded.  Its too bad the previous reviewer failed to be more specific.  There are so many great songs not on Pet Sounds how can you not buy this collection.
B000A2H812|5.0|Very flexible musicians who rock in so many ways. Just listen to \\"60 revolutions\\" a few times with headphones. They don't really fit in a genre. Refreshing.
B000003TAR|2.0|After four years owning this album, I still can't get used to it. I'm not sure if it's the walls of feedback and really lame solos or if it's just Cobain's bad screaming. Maybe it's a combination of all three. There are a few standout tracks such as Serve The Servants, Rape Me, Heart Shaped Box, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea, and All Appologies.<br /><br />Less than half the album is worth listening to. If the other seven tracks were equally as good as the five mentioned above, I think we'd have a decent album on our hands and I could write a good review for it. But unfortunately, the rest just seems to be repetative screaming and feedback...and even though I grew up with grunge, I still can't get used to the drivel on this record. Save your money.
B00000AFGM|1.0|This guy is such a fake it's not even funny. Almost everything he's done was done before by Alice Cooper. Changing your first name to that of a girl's? Very original...idiot. Makeup? Coop's got that covered. Shock-rock and theatrics in live shows? Oh please. That was done while this guy was a baby. <br /> <br />The only thing \\"original\\" about this guy is his hatred for, well, just about everything. Rips up the Bible on stage? That's just desperate. Yelling that he hates God? This guy's retarded. <br /> <br />His music also sucks. With Alice Cooper, you have good songs to back up the stage theatrics. This guy seems to be making money off of shocking idiot teenagers who think what he's doing is new, revolutionary, and cool. His music is horrible. <br /> <br />How can anyone even take him seriously? He's a JOKE!!! He should be paying royalties to Alice Cooper for every CD his clueless fans buy.
6305781427|5.0|The CD doesn't do Yanni justice.  This DVD is full of fantastic images of Yanni and his entire grand accompaniment. You almost feel like you are there with them at the Acropolis!!!!  I have watched it over and over.  Wonderful!!!!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Well, actually 3 and a half stars, but you can't do that, so I'll round it up. Avril has matured a lot since the last one, and the songs have harsher lyrics and are rock more than pop. I like it, personally. High points: the hit My Happy Ending, Take Me Away, and Don't Tell Me. They're catchy and you can relate to them. Low points: He Wasn't and How Does It Feel. They have crappy lyrics and How Does It Feel barely even has a tune.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I can't imagine the BMRC permanently dropping their electric sound, so I assume this is an experimental acoustic venture.  Well, it really works!!  MUCH more artistically successful than the JAMC's \\"Stoned and Dethroned\\"!  And that wasn't bad!  I think this was a good time for the BMRC to take their sound to a very different place.  Yet they STILL SOUND LIKE THE BMRC, folks!!  VERY enjoyable album!!!
B0002OOUP0|4.0|Let's face it, the Hot Rocks material is a lot better than that of Jump Back. Although this does take songs from Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street, some of the rest falls in the \\"weak\\" category. Every song on Hot Rocks was solid. The same cannot be said for Jump Back. I, for one, am quite tired of Angie. The strings are just overkill and suck the life out of it. Fool to Cry is an example of wasted potential: if it weren't for the fact that it's overly-synthesized and has those obnoxious, high-pitched backing vocals, it would've been good. Black N Blue's other selection, Hot Stuff, is just plain dull. Hand of Fate should've been picked instead. Emotional Rescue is, quite frankly, the dumbest piece of crap the Stones ever recorded. I could take or leave Mixed Emotions and Undercover. But there is some good material: Start Me Up, Brown Sugar, Tumbling Dice, Only Rock 'n' Roll, Waiting on a Friend, Rock and a Hard Place, etc.<br /><br />Here's how I'd put it, the new songs being starred:<br /><br />1. Brown Sugar<br /><br />2. Wild Horses<br /><br />3. Bitch<br /><br />4. Moonlight Mile*<br /><br />5. Rocks Off*<br /><br />6. Tumbling Dice<br /><br />7. Happy*<br /><br />8. Soul Survivor*<br /><br />9. Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)*<br /><br />10. Only Rock 'n' Roll<br /><br />11. Time Waits for No One*<br /><br />12. Hand of Fate*<br /><br />13. Miss You<br /><br />14. Beast of Burden<br /><br />15. Respectable<br /><br />16. Shattered*<br /><br />17. Start Me Up<br /><br />18. Waiting On a Friend<br /><br />19. Undercover (I guess)<br /><br />20. Rock and a Hard Place<br /><br />21. Mixed Emotions (Maybe)<br /><br />Note how I threw on three more selections from Exile.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|Im not agree with other reviewers here about pilgrim or reptile. i like a lot enough songs in each of them to keep those records in my collection. <br />But im agree about this record. is a bad one. Im not talking about simplicity( by the way, take a look to richard bona, you will remember me for this advice) vs complexity or commercial music vs no compromise music. im talking about good ar bad music. thats the point. <br />you can listen this songs one and another time and nothing will remain in your heart or mind after this. just music for hear in the supermarket helping you to choose your stuff in a good atmosphere. thats all. sry for my basic english. its not my lenguage.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I never saw this as i was flipping through the cable stations and missing 15 minutes left it on and was not sure what this movie was about. <br /> <br />I watched it and was far from dissapointed. The humor in this movie is so damn funny, but in an odd way.  <br /> <br />Dynamite is the nerdiest of the nerds and his acting is just amazing, just doing some real wierd and unusual stuff his brother and friend Pedro are just as wacked and funny as well.. I dont give any movies really 5 stars but this movie was so damn cool, I couldnt stop laughing at what the hell i was see'ing and thats in a good way. <br /> <br />this is a 5 star movie go get it I know I am .
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The DVD is just superb; saw the show on TV when they played in Melbourne.  Saw them live in California couple of years ago and they are even better than then!  Only wish could get this tour on CD so could play the music in my car or on my iPod:(
B00005JMXX|5.0|Maybe people's expectations of movies are really high these days, for all the negative reviews this is getting, but I rather enjoyed the movie.  I've been hearing a lot of the effects of global warming on the weather, probably a good example of that is Hurricane Katrina and the Tsunami at SE Asia, but I digress.  This movie could be a forecast of things to come or is starting to happen now according to radio shows like Coast to Coast AM.  The special effects of the movie is top notch, and the story is good.  People say that the drama part doesn't go well, with the premise of a global disaster.  This is a movie, it has to have that story element of it, or else this will be a documentary.  I like the story and the dramatic elements because when disaster strikes, the human condition is what is affected the most and it shows in this movie.  Anyway, I think this movie is good and it should be given credit where credit is due.
B00004W199|1.0|I expected this film to be bad and I was not disappointed. <br />The old cars, clothes and camera techniques were fun in their own way - and I accomplished my mission - I saw the horror flick filmed at Saltair Pavilion.
B000AAF276|4.0|3 stars for the album and 4 1/2 for the DVD side high resolution audio. Not one of Eric's best efforts, but a very comforting album mostly dedicated to the songwriters he admires most over the years and to his family. If you're a Clapton fan (and have learned not to expect too much), you'll enjoy it. I bought the DualDisc version and am very impressed with the audio quality on the DVD side which for once is in real DVD-Audio (both 2 channel & 5.1 surround) using 24 bit sampled at 48khz.  This is so welcome since most DVD sides on DualDiscs only provide Dolby Digital sound which is way too compressed.
B000002IZM|5.0|If you are like me you have always mourned that Vangelis did not come out with this sooner.  The non-vangelis orchestral version of this paled in comparison.  Not all tracks sound like they belong, but for the fanatic (me) the disk is worth it just for the true version of \\"Tales of the Future\\".
B0000028UK|4.0|This album caught a lot of flack and a lot of people didn't like it.  I am not one of those people, I really liked this album.  Trying to follow up \\"Ten\\" (one of the greatest rock albums ever) is a difficult thing to do and soph. albums more often then not end up sucking.  Vs is solid Pearl Jam that any fan will love.  Will also be enjoyed by fans of 90s rock.
B00005AQF7|5.0|First off, I am a huge snoop fan.  Except for 1-2 of them, I enjoy listening to all of his albums.  But, this album is exceptionally better than all the rest.  Doggystyle is snoop's first solo album, and his best.  Not only that, it is probably the best album from the 90's.  Tracks like \\" Gin and Juice \\" will never be challenged by any rapper except for tupac ( R.I.P. ).  People that doubt the greatness of this album either don't like rap, or have never heard it.  If you are a self respecting rap fan, I demand you go and buy this album immediately.<br />My Song Ratings:<br />G-Funk Intro - 4/5<br />Gin and Juice - 5/5<br />Tha Shiznit - 5/5<br />Lodi Dodi - 4/5<br />Murder Was The Case - 5/5<br />Serial Killa - 5/5<br />Who Am I ( What's My Name? ) - 5/5<br />For All My Niggaz And Bitches - 5/5<br />Aint No Fun - 4/5<br />Doggy Dogg World - 5/5<br />Gz and Hustlas - 5/5<br />Pump Pump - 5/5<br />I STRONGLY recommend you go buy this album RIGHT NOW
B0000C1733|4.0|If you like Red Hot Chili Peppers then you will love this album, it is just that simple.  It is also great for any fan of rock or 90s music.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|Clearly the sales of the CD speak by themselves. My favorites, the two versions of \\"La Tortura\\". Really Excellent. Shakira is back!<br /><br />I already had bought both version on iTunes, but it was really worthy to pay again. You get the regular CD on one side, and a DVD on the other, with the interesting/exciting video clip  \\"La Tortura\\", some video extras, and all the songs, but on 5.1 format, to listen on the home theater, and what a difference!<br /><br />Because this technology is new, be warned that you might not be able to play it on old devices (my guess, more than 2-3 years old). I was able to play the DVD and CD on my desktop, my home theater and my car stereo without a problem.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />I was about time you get something extra for a CD. This product diferentiation vis-a-vis buying digital tunes on the internet is more then welcome.<br /><br />Amigos latinoamericanos, vale la pena, cada penny. Ademas del CD normal por un lado, el otro lado es DVD y tiene el video de La Tortura, y pueden escuchar la musica en el home theater en 5.1. Por fin las disqueras despertaron y nos estan dando un producto con valor agregado, diferente a comprar musica por la internet. Ya era hora que dejaran de pelear con los clientes y dar algo que vale los $14 que estamos pagando por un CD.
0385510454|4.0|I am just now starting to read Grisham (so far I've read \\"Bleachers\\" and \\"Skipping Xmas\\") and I was pleased with his newest effort.  Most of the book takes place in Bologna, Italy which really appeals to me since the fraternity I was in in college has its origins in that city.  Basically if you like any of Grisham's Books or Movies then you will like this one.  I also recommend it for anyone looking to read Grisham for the first time or who just wants a good gov. thriller.
B00008CLOA|1.0|This CD would not play on my system, so I returned and replaced it with Dark Side of the Moon, which works perfectly.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is a very different film then you will probably be use to, but it will soon be one of your favorites.  With Idaho painting an odd backdrop for an already odd movie, you will soon find yourself in a place most movies simply won't take you to.  With dozens of one-liners and hysterical scenes (\\"Pedro offers you his protection\\" \\"How much you wanna bet I can throw a football over them mountains\\").  This movie is a must see.
B000002UAF|5.0|The Beatles started out with the albums, Please Please Me and With the Beatles.  Although the first two were excellent this one was even better.  The songwriting is very good and it is original material.  The thing that makes the cd so great is that the songwriting is nice and simple, not overdone. <br /> <br />The McCartney/Lennon duo is starting to develop.  George Harrison plays an excellent guitar, and the strumming is beautiful.  Ringo on the drums is great, and they all, like a later Beatles song, come together.   <br /> <br />I think this album is left out when talking about their great albums because they are overshadowed by later albums like Revolver and Rubber, which don't take me wrong are amazing.  But this one also, for me, ranks up their. <br /> <br />Starting off with the title song, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", a classic, with the famous George Harrison strumming.  \\"If I Fell\\" and \\"I Love Her\\" are beautiful ballads.  \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is a classic that I think almost everyone on this planet knows. <br /> <br />\\"Things We Said Today\\" is another great (and one of my favorite) Beatles songs.  The guitar in the beginning is excellent and the rhythm and beat of the song really make it fantastic. <br /> <br />For a big Beatles fan and/or collector, this is a must have.  The album is so enjoyable to listen to, and is packed with 13 of the Beatles finest. Thank you.
B00000DG1R|4.0|I like Duran Duran and thusly I really like this album.  If you are a fan of their music, no matter if it is the old stuff or the new stuff, you will like this album.  Great for any fan of 80s music.
B000059QYB|4.0|This is the best of Billy Idol, come on, of course it is great!!  The beginning and end of the album are the strongest as you might choose to skip over a few of the middle tracks.  Overall it is a great album and a must have for any 80s Music or Rock fan.
B000053V7O|5.0|I watched this movie about a hundred times because I love jazz and love melancholy movies.  It is one of the most bittersweet tales I know.  It is not mushy sentimentality and it is not depressing to the max.  If we look back at our lives what does it really count is the gist of the story.  That applies to everyone.  We all have some form of angst and we all have moments of ennui and melange.  It is what we do with the rest of the time that counts.  How have you left your mark?
006441034X|5.0|Before the movie came out on DVD I wanted to read the novel.  I know what the movie is about and I heard it was \\"loosely based\\" on the novel.<br /><br />Little did I know that the novel was so delightful!  As much as I love Miyazaki films, I don't think he could have wrapped up all the delightful parts for his readers in 2 hours or so.  For those who have not seen the movie, I think the two can remain separate (meaning you can partake in one and not the other and be equally satisfied) because from what I read of Miyazaki's interviews, the movie goes along very different focuses and themes.<br /><br />What I found the most enchanting about the book were the rich characters.  I don't think any movie could ever do it justice, Miyazaki or not.  Howl seems to be the absolute opposite of what a hero should be, but he does grow on the reader and he's really not quite as clueless and self-absorbed as he leads others to believe.  And Sophie is the spunky heroine that I thought she would be, although flawed and imperfect, she is very human and this makes her admirable.<br /><br />It's an easy 300 some pages to read and I finished it in a day (laughter occupied some time, and I reread the ending 2x).  It brings back familiar themes of fairytales from childhood and evokes some nostalgia on the reader's part.  There's an evil witch, a hero and heroine, rich people and poor people, the working middle class and royalty.  But the author is a riot in the way she says things so simplisticly, matter-of-factly and sarcastically.  She's very witty throughout, which makes it such an entertaining read!<br /><br />In this book there are surprises around the bend, and nothing is as it appears.  All in all I think people of all ages can and should read this book, though notably it is in the young reader/independent reader/teen section.  My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough to satiate my interest, and the denoument cuts off rather abrutly.  But you can be the judge of how much romance you need in your life to be satisfied.uch romance you need in your life to be satisfied.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I was invited over a friend's house to watch the DVD, Concert for George, when it had first become available to purchase. It was so much more than I had expected. There were six of us there to share the experience. We had all grown up listening to the Beatles & the music of the other musicians that were there to perform the songs of George Harrison. As we watched them on stage at the Albert King Hall in London; Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, Ringo Star, Paul McCartney & many more, and seeing George's son Dhani, a splitting image of him, it pulled so many emotions; nostalgia, memories of old times. We sang with it, cried & laughed. It was truly a fine tribute to George. Each and every musician not only performed his songs with such powerful professionalism but also as his comrades. It was evident how much they were inspired by him. I also enjoyed very much, how photos of George were incorporated in the film as a young man & through the most current times of his life. The concert as a whole was well put together with much thought & plenty of heart. Everyone involved with the film obviously love him as much as we as fans do, young & old. Now, my friend not only enjoys watching this concert time & time again but also plays nearly every darn song on his own guitar while watching it. And so the effect it has taken is quite predictable; I bought the DVD as a gift to my brother & soon to purchase one for myself...to watch time & time again. <br /> <br />
0684800713|3.0|This is the first Hemingway book I have ever read and I honestly didn't care much for it.  While Hemingway is a talented writer with wonderful prose, I just couldn't get into the story or even really care about it.  I don't know if that is due to some sort of generational or time gap, or maybe his stories just aren't for me.  I might read another Hemingway book, but not any time soon.
B000002G6J|5.0|Mix jazz and bossa nova, and a little of love and sexy beats, and you get one of the best albums of Jobim. <br />It's difficult to choose which is better, singing or playing keys. Not mention the incredible compositions. He is always the best
B00005J6UP|5.0|What a Classic this movie is.  I have never met anyone who didn't absolutely love this movie.  With rememberable characters and classic one-liners, you will be watching and quoting this movie over and over again.  If your movies collection is 1000 DVDS or just one, you need to own this incredible movie.
0151008116|4.0|THE ENDING ON THIS BOOK WAS GREAT!!!  I don't want to ruin it for you all, but it was excellent.  It does drag in the middle... repetitive... but being stranding on a boat for so long would do that right?!  The beginning was great, the middle dragged, but the ending parts were brilliant!   <br /> <br />The Life of Pi goes from a young... maybe spoiled child... with conviction, following contrasting religious aspects, to a young, mature man who can thrive on his own. <br /> <br />There was excellent forshadowing and imagery to this book!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|While I loved the opening shot, the rest of the movie didn't really do anything for me.  I don't want to come out and say it was bad, but this movie just wasn't for me.  It had it moments, but I don't think I'll be watching this one over and over again.
B00005RZV4|4.0|4 1/2 stars<br /><br />When it comes to live albums, you never know. I'm often let down. Live versions of songs usually sound thin in comparison to the studio recordings and are usually just something that the hard-core fans will want. Fortunately, this is not the case with Nine Inch Nails live album \\"And All that Could Have Been.\\"<br /><br />The main difference between a live NIN album and a studio recording is the presence of a backup band. On \\"And All that Could Have Been,\\" Trent Reznor is joined with Robin Finck (guitar, keyboard), Danny Lohner (bass, guitar, keyboard), Jerome Dillon (drums) and Charlie Clouser (keyboards). These songs were recorded from various shows during the 2000 \\"Fragility\\" tour.<br /><br />I actually prefer the live versions of the \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" era songs to the originals. Although \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" is a classic, a remastered version would be welcome. With a backup band and added guitar, \\"Terrible Lie,\\" \\"Sin,\\" and \\"Head like a Hole\\" sound stronger here then they do on the original release. While the live renditions of the other tracks (from \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" \\"Broken,\\" \\"The Fragile\\" and misc.) generally do not surpass the studio versions, they sound exciting none-the-less and should please most fans by giving them a different take on the songs. The rendition of \\"Hurt\\" sounds especially interesting. One might think that such a personal, intimate song would not translate well in the arena, but it never looses its intensity. Indeed, \\"Hurt\\" sounds just as powerful here as it does on \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" only its power is magnified by the presence and empathy of a subdued yet energized audience.<br /><br />The tracklist serves, more-or-less, as a NIN greatest hits. While one could argue for the inclusion of some songs, and the exclusion of others, it's essentially a good overview and sampling of NIN catalogue up to that point. The order of the songs is arranged in such a way that the album never looses momentum or is anti-climatic. While the songs were taken from different shows, the album sounds coherent and never hackneyed. Trent Reznor notes in the accompanying live DVD that \\"And All that Could Have Been.\\" comes as close as you can to emulate the live NIN experience. NIN is definitely an exciting band to see live and this CD (and the DVD) do a great job of capturing the live experience.<br /><br />\\"And All that Could Have Been.\\" was originally released as a single album and also as a double album with a second disc titled \\"Still.\\" This second disc contains stripped down renditions of various NIN songs. While this double CD edition is now out-of-print (although it can be bought used at Amazon) the \\"Still\\" CD is still available via NIN.com. For NIN fans it's defiantly worth checking out.or is anti-climatic. While the songs were taken from different shows, the album sounds coherent and never hackneyed.

B0007P3582|5.0|I am in love with 50 cents music. On this album 50 just went all out, he dissed anyone who rapped with Ja Rule went as far as calling his time with V.Fox a fling in Get In My Car. I am in love with A Baltimore Love Thing and Build You Up. Everyone loves Candy Shop and Just A Little Bit. Im Supposed To Die Tonight is also one of my favorites. To those of you who are hatin on this album need to stop, thats why it sold over 1 million in its first week. Fifty got it and he shut the lips of Ja Rule and soon to shut the lips on Fat Joe also. I love fifty you need to understand where he is coming from and just relax and listen his music. I already own the Massacre and after classes today I sure as hell am going for the re-released version. <br />50 Cent run the next Bloodclawth track and kill the rest rappers the whole ah Jamaica love you!!!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Wow. This CD has made System Of A Down, without a doubt, my favorite band. That is no easy task. Their last three albums were all incredible. They were all forceful, strong, loud, and bursting with vitality. \\"Mezmerize\\" has all of these qualities and more. <br /> <br />The album begins with the socio-political \\"B.Y.O.B.\\"--Bring Your Own Bombs. The song satirizes the Army's advertising and recruiting campaign, making it seem like a \\"party,\\" where everyone's \\"having a real good time.\\" Whether your pro- or anti-war, this song is excellent with an excellent stop-and-go feel and catchy chorus. <br /> <br />\\"Old School Hollywood\\" is not political at all, but rather a tale of a bandmate's experience at a celebrity fantasy baseball camp. Has-beens and B-list celebs attended, like Tony Danza. He cuts in line, apparently. <br /> <br />The other songs run the gamut from more political rage (\\"Sad Statue\\") to typical System Of A Down (\\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\", \\"Violent Pornography\\"), to hilarious (\\"Cigaro\\"). <br /> <br />All in all, every song is memorable through just one sitting, a feat most CDs do not accomplish. Every song has something you will remember with just one listen. My only complaint is the CD's very short length (38 minutes!), but all is forgiven if the 2nd part of the CD, \\"Hypnotize\\", makes up for it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
6304696566|5.0|John Ford and John Wayne were both at the top of their game when they made this movie. It is a great film, very engrossing and entertaining. <br /> <br />Wayne plays a man who comes back to his brother's ranch after the Civil War. He joins a posse out looking for Comanche who have attacked a nearby farm. The posse realizes too late that the Comanche have doubled back and attacked other farm. Ethan discovers that they have killed his brother and his brother's family. Only his niece has survived. She's been kidnapped. Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter, who was raised by his brother, swear that they won't stop until he finds her. Only Wayne doesn't intend to rescue her. <br /> <br />This movie is a great look at revenge and the people who seek it.
B000AJJNOK|1.0|I Can't even believe that this trash is still being released again, this is still one of the absolute worst albums of 2005, and the DVD version is even worse, horrible videos (I Didn't laugh one single thing on that godawful piggybank music video), horrible rapping, and nothing else. <br /> <br />This album is junk when it first got released, and this re-release is still junk. <br /> <br /> <br />The Massacre CD/DVD No Stars. <br /> <br />50 & G-Unot represents everything that is wrong with music these days. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There wasn't much on this summer and I remember enjoying Firefly soooo.. I bought the series. Each night I watched a couple of episodes and they certainly made me smile. I just wish there were more of them and I do plan on watching the movie when it comes out.  Please, SCI FI channel, make them start some new ones. :)  <br /> <br />Now, there are some scenes probably left not on prime time, well, I guess they are showing more nudity scenes on TV but your kids aren't much going to like it. At least mine weren't into it. All in all it was a nice escape from the garbage that was on cable this summer.
0385338686|4.0|My daughter introduced me to the \\"Shopoholic\\" series and I became an instant fan of Sophie Kinsella.  This is another great read that keeps you interested, laughing, smiling, and thinking.  The story is of a young woman who is consumed by her career, a true type A personality that finds out that having Saturday without commitment is harder than she ever thought it could be. Some of of us can relate......I only wish there were a few more \\"domestic problems\\" for Samantha like Becky in the Shopoholic series; her problems were short lived. Still it was very enjoyable.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Ghost Reveries is indeed a CD that captures all of Opeth's great elements- perhaps too much. There are really three sounds on this album. There is the very downtempo progressive rock we hear on their previous album \\"Damnation.\\" There is also a strong dark element and contrast of heavy guitar sounds and striking melody, as in their album \\"Still Life.\\" I would give this disc four and a half stars, but there is no option for that. I will award it five, because it is somewhat innovative. Three vocal styles are used on the album. There is the heavy growling, the dialogue style of lyrics, and the melodic singing style. I like all three, but there is too much of a disjointed feel to the album, it doesn't flow quite as well as \\"Still Life,\\" but then not much does. However, each song is different, and satisfies in a different way. Opeth reached their peak when they created \\"Morningrise,\\" which was not only a solid five-star offering, but one of the best Heavy Metal CDs ever. Overall, this CD is better than their last couple of offerings, \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Damnation.\\" It stands out among their offerings as the CD where all of their styles are put together quite nicely. Standout tracks include \\"Ghost of Perdition,\\" \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest,\\" and \\"The Grand Conjuration.\\" Some of the songs are highly melodic, and similar to tracks from their \\"Damnation\\" album, such as the eclectic song \\"Atonement.\\" The song \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" is mostly clean vocals, but with heavier instrumentals. Still other songs range from clean vocals to heavy growling. Perhaps this is at least one of Opeth's most mature releases to date.
1932907009|5.0|The question arises every class.  I have yet to go through one quarter of teaching screenwriting where one student doesn't ask me about the \\"ART\\" of screenwriting and his/her role as an \\"Artist.\\"  When someone asks me that I realize they want validation.  They want a hint that what their doing is rising above the masses.  That what they are creating is a one and only work of art - never to be created again - by any one - in any time.  It's at that point that I ask:  \\"Is \\"White Chicks\\" art?  Is \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" art?  Is \\"Gigli\\" art?\\"  By week eight, when I talk about Hollywood I remind them that what they are creating is a product told in story.  They're story-tellers (and usually damn good ones) but are they artists?  I think that's up to someone else to decide.<br /><br />FINALLY a book that doesn't even mention the word \\"ART\\" or, even \\"ARTIST.\\"  I swear, I looked and I didn't find it.  Finally a book that says what I've always wanted to say:  \\"Darn it!  I want to write a screenplay, I want it to entertain a million people and I want to make a boat load of money so I can write MORE screenplays that entertain millions of people so I can make even MORE boat-loads of money!\\"  It's honest.  It's real.  It's \\"Save the Cat!\\"<br /><br />This book is the best book on screenwriting since Linda Seeger's \\"How to Make A Good Script Great.\\"  Blake Snyder, who has actually SOLD screenplays that were produced, does an excellent job of cutting through the Hollywood BS and explaining screenwriting in a way that anyone can understand.  He is clear, concise, to the point.  He uses examples from current movies (he could always use more) to make his points and he does it in a way that makes it seem like you're chatting over a microbrew at a local pub.  There's no \\"high-faluttin'\\" gloss that he puts on everything - it's just honest commentary on the craft of screenwriting.<br /><br />One of the best things a teacher, or writer, can do is take a concept that on the surface seems complicated and boil it down to something that ISN'T complicated - something that everyone can understand.  Blake Snyder does this.  He expands on the genre field.  Instead of genres like \\"romantic comedy\\" or \\"sci-fi\\" he has genres like:  \\"Monster in the House\\" or \\"Rites of Passage\\" or \\"Buddy Love\\" and he gives you many examples of each.  Instead of talking about \\"Subtext\\" - he simply asks:  \\"What is it?\\"  Instead of talking about the three act structure - he breaks it into four acts and emphasizes his points.  Trust me, you'll learn quickly about what goes into a good script.<br /><br />He also discusses, in great length, \\"High Concept\\", \\"Log-Lines\\" and the \\"Blake Snyder - Beat Sheet\\" - a tool to make sure your script is on the right path.<br /><br />Besides explaining things clearly and concisely, he has summaries and exercises at the end of each chapter so after you read it - you can go back and reference these tools to better help your screenwriting.<br /><br />Now, is this \\"The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need?\\" (rumor has it that Blake is writing a follow-up book entitled:  \\"Pope In The Pool\\" - so maybe this is this SECOND to last book on Screenwriting you'll ever need).  Saying this is the \\"Last Book\\" is a pretty bold statement and, as excellent as this book is, there are a couple things that Blake does that I question:  1.  He forces a page number.  Such as:  \\"This needs to happen on page 25.  And this needs to happen on page 55.\\"  When I have tried to force things to land on certain pages - I felt it tied my hands too much.  In my opinion, you could be a page or two away from the ideal for it to work.  For a beginning screenwriter this might prove extremely difficult - though he makes great cases explaining why these plot points need to happen on these pages.  And 2.  He is a strong believer in \\"carding\\" the script.  Breaking down your scenes into 3 x 5 cards and splaying them on a table or board.  I've tried this in the past and found it did nothelp me as much as a plain outline.  Both of the above methods did not work for me (I've yet to sell a script though) but they may work wonderfully for you.<br /><br />\\"Save the Cat!\\" is by far the best screenwriting book that I have read in a long time.  It doesn't even crack 200 pages and that's with a 10 page glossary.  When my class starts in the fall I will be recommending the book to my students - it's THAT good.  It's great for beginning screenwriters and advanced screenwriters.  It puts into your brain the main things you need to think about before you start writing and then gives you the tools to expand and explore your idea.  Buy this book.  You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />One other note:  Blake Snyder mentions Harold Lloyd in this book.  It's nice to see Harold getting mentioned.  If you don't know who Harold Lloyd is, e-mail me or take a class on film history.  If you DO know who Harold Lloyd is, take yourself out for a beer and a large order of nachos.it did not help me as much as a plain outline.

B0001WTVUW|4.0|I was 10 years old when this film aired back in 1983, and I was afraid to watch it.  I think it aired at 9pm Eastern, which was my bedtime at that age anyway, but even if I could stay up to watch it, I wouldn't.  As a 10 year old, nuclear war was something that really scared me. <br /> <br />I'm 32 now, and I was surprised to see this released on DVD.  By now, my fear of the film had long since turned to fascination, and I decided to pick it up.  I'd wondered how the characters in the film could've survived, and how the film could've ended.  I was expecting the film to be a bit more subdued than today's television, and to be a bit dated as well (most things from the 80's are).  As it turns out, I was wrong on both counts. <br /> <br />If you're reading this, you probably already know the plot: in a nutshell, the USSR and USA get into a nuclear war, and the \\"lucky\\" survivors have to live (or try to live) in the aftermath.  While the film is not exactly a gore-fest, it is a little graphic, and is definitely unsettling.  One of the things I was wondering as I was watching the film was how they were going to manage all of the characters they were introducing before the missiles came.  They answer: they DON'T manage all those characters afterwards.  Read into that what you will. <br /> <br />This is definitely a \\"What would I do in this situation?\\" kind of film.  The effects are decent by 1980's standards (but dated by today's), and the film is well-acted, especially by Steve Guttenberg, who really surprised me.  It starts off a bit slow, but I'm assuming that's done to develop character and get you to care about these people before all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br />I'm really glad I didn't watch this when I was 10. <br /> <br />A few side notes: for the life of me, I couldn't place where I'd seen the bike-riding blond fiancee guy before, but then it hit me: it's the same actor who played the young Clark Kent in \\"Superman: The Movie\\" (Jeff East).  Also, I've read thatBen Stein was critical of this film when it came out.  For those of you who don't know, Ben Stein is an actor, famous for his role as the droll teacher in \\"Ferris Bueler's Day Off\\" (\\"Bueler...Bueler...Bueler...\\").  He also did some commercials for \\"Clear Eyes\\" eye drops, hosted his own show called \\"Win Ben Stein's Money\\", and was a speechwriter for Richard Nixon.  Stein was also critical of Mark Felt when it was revealed that Felt was \\"Deep Throat\\".  Stein defended Nixon, say that, even though Nixon was a liar, at least he wasn't a liar and drug addict like John F. Kennedy, or a liar and war-starter like Lyndon Johnson, etc.  He also criticized Felt in American Spectator, saying that he looked like a Nazi war criminal.  Stein feels that Nixon's authorization of the Watergate break-in and subsequent involvement in the cover-up should not have been exposed.  This should tell you a little bit about Ben Stein. <br /> <br />Anyway, even though Ben doesn't recommend this film, I do.  In fact, I recommend watching this film WITH Ben Stein, if you can somehow pull it off. <br /> <br />One last thing: the last chapter on the DVD is entitled \\"Hope\\".  Personally, it's the last word I would've used.  Where the hope was in that last scene, I couldn't tell you.

If you do not like books that have, too many mysteries you should not read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES because the book has many mysteries that need to be solve.  I recommend the book to readers who like to solve mysteries and to those who want to have a good time while reading a book.  The book is 293 pages long it is very long but is worth it because you get the chance to read a very cool reading book.  The book has many life lessons that can teach you how to deal with daily life problems.  I learned many life lessons from the book one thing that I learned was not to be nave when people are warning you about something that could hurt you and you do not even listen to them because you do not trust them.

0156027321|3.0|I strongly suggest that you read Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, because it always gave me the feeling to keep on reading.  This book was filled with suspense.  It always gives me the urge to continue and I couldn't put the book down.  In the book, not every chapter contributed to the main story like how when they started taking about sloths.  The main story is about a boy nicknamed Pi who was on a boat with his family and it sank.  Pi was rescued and put on a lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, and a tiger.  He had to be brave and figure out how to survive.  I really liked reading the part while he was on the boat.  It was so interesting and surprising to see everything that he had to start doing in order to live.  If you like a suspenseful book, read Life of Pi.  The book is a bit challenging so you have to do some thinking in order to understand everything.  If you want a challenge, read this book.  An important lesson taught in this piece of text is to never give up no matter how hard it gets.  Pi was on the boat for a very long time and he never gave up on himself.  Life is tough for us at school but I haven't given up.

B0009UC7H0|3.0|I would not say this is a good movie or a bad movie it's in the middle so it's an ok film. The movie is an adventure film so it's farfetched throughout the movie. Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey is looking for a Confederate ironclad ship that impossibly might have ended up in the desert. Soon he and his faithful sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are lost in another adventure, discovering a deadly contaminate being tracked by a beautiful doctor (Penelope Cruz). The story about the confederate ship is good and entertainign it's the story about the poison in the water that is boring. If they would of sticked with finding the ship it would of been a really good movie. The movie is so predictable and funny at times for example they find Penelope Cruz in a well out of the whole desert as if but it's a movie. The movie is entertaining and it's pretty good at times for me to recomand.
B000008HPE|5.0|Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consimante professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.

B00005JMYI|1.0|What happened?    This movie had a decent premise.  There is much to poke fun at about the seventies, but this movie didn't do it.  It seems as though nobody associated with this movie was trying very hard.    Somebody already mentioned the missed opportunity for a running gag about Ron reading whatever is on the teleprompter.  The scene where Corningstone and Burgandy trade insults over the credits, while very good initially, ran much too long and would have been more effective as a running gag.    At one point, there is a \\"rumble\\" between news teams of competing stations.  Initially, it was fun, but dragged on way too long.    There were perhaps half a dozen good scenes.  But, rather than write more good scenes, this movie chose to drag those half dozen out until they weren't funny anymore.
B00005JNTX|5.0|The 3 main stories in this movie are all unique and different yet connected through Club Pecos in Basin City. Theres Bruce Willis as Hartigan, a cop whos only priority in life is protecting Nancy(Jessica Alba) whom he saved when she was a child. Theres also Marv whos obsessed with finding the killer of Goldie(Jamie King), the women he just meet but seemed to love for treating him so well dispite his appearence. Finally theres Dwight (Clive Owen) barmaid Shellie's (Britanny Murphy)new boyfriend who spends the night deffending Gail and her old town girls from Jackie Boy, a violent guy whos death stirrs up problems for the girls at Old Town. <br />    All these stories go into alot of depth and so you just have to watch the movie to see what happens. Overall it is a great movie, the black and white makes it look very cool and comic book like, while the hint of color in each character brings them to life.
B00005JODA|5.0|I have not cared very much for films or television series based on the novels of John Le Carre; they have been slow moving and I found I usually did not care about the characters.  The Constant Gardiner is much different.  At first, judging from the trailers, it seemed the film might be too intense and sad but I found that the tragic elements of the story were handled well.  The film begins in Africa with the brutal murder of Tessa (Rachael Weisz) and disappearance of her companion, a native doctor (Hubert Kounde).  The film then moves to Tessa's husband Justin, a member of the British High Commission in Nairobi (Ralph Finnes), being told his wife is dead by his slippery \\"friend\\" Sandy (Danny Huston).  The story is told with sensitivity relating the love story between Tessa and Justin through flashbacks, the editing of which is handled with great skill.     Tessa was an outspoken woman and the opposite of the quiet Justin.  They have an arrangement that they will have an open marriage not pry into each other's lives.  So there is a mystery surrounding Tessa.  Was she having an affair with the native doctor?  Did he kill her?  Justin is haunted by remorse that he could have done something to prevent Tessa's death and gradually learns that his wife had uncovered a secret, and she was killed to prevent its exposure.     Ralph Finnes is magnificent as the mild mannered Justin.  We watching him grow from his first meeting with Tessa from a shy lover into a settled family life and his determination to discover the truth about her death.  Rachael Weisz is also excellent as Tessa; she is the opposite of Justin in her forward and outspoken nature, willing to confront anyone. Danny Houston is perfect as Sandy, although claiming to be a friend to Tessa and Justin he does not think twice about betraying them.  The conspirators behind Tessa's death are particularly effective with Nick Reding playing the cold-hearted Crick.  It was interesting to see Pete Postlethwaite (Brassed Off) playing Dr. Lorbeer, a tired old doctor working out in the bush who provides Justin with his evidence.       I did find the photography a little jarring at times.  Many of the flashbacks were shot with hand-held cameras deliberately made unsteady, as if someone was making a home movie - perhaps to give the impression of random thoughts?.  The shaking of the camera and blurring of the picture actually made my wife dizzy.  Overall, I found that most of it worked, and that the cinematography was impressive.       The characters of the film are finely drawn and the story moves along at a steady pace; we are drawn into the lives of Justin and Tessa from the beginning to the end.  I thought that the memories that Justin has of the dead Tessa were particularly well done and place nicely throughout the film.  It brings home his love and devotion for her and that she is never out of his mind.  We understand his drive to discover the truth and are carried along until the conclusion.  Another important subject of the film is how African countries are being exploited.  We see the vast slum of Nairobi where 80,000 people live in tin huts amid every kind of filth. So, The Constant Gardiner tells not only a story of people caught in a conspiracy but also something of the poverty of Africans and how countries like Kenya are still at the mercy of the developed countries.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|My sense of humor is about as dry as they come. I was under the impression that \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" was pretty deadpan, so I was really looking forward to watching it. What a disappointment.     The opening scene was promising (when Napoleon drags an action figure along the road and answers a young student's inquiries with almost aggressive bravado), but the rest of the movie is repetitive if not depressing. \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is the same joke told over and over again: Napoleon is not \\"cool.\\" His behavior is bizarre. He is totally unaware ... Etc. Etc. Etc.     For some reason, viewers everywhere have rallied behind Napoleon. It strikes me as odd, considering that he has absolutely no personality (oddities do not equal personality), no emotions, no depth. I think that this film is much more mindless and mainstream than its admirers would like to think.    I am not suggesting that you *don't* watch this movie.  Obviously, a lot of people love it.  However, for those of you that are expecting a subtle comedic gem like `Bottle Rocket' - be forewarned: you may very well be gravely disappointed.
0895260131|2.0|I think the writer is a bit too emotional about the subject.  It is clear he has done his research, but for me, it is a little too shallow and all over the place, at least the first half.  I have not read the Crusades section yet (part2).  It may improve there.
0385486804|3.0|John Krakauer publishes the account of Chris McCandless, a disaffected young man who abandoned civilization to live alone in the wilds of Alaska. <br /> <br />The subject is an interesting one, and shows interesting parallels to the story of Timothy Treadwell, the man whose life and death among grizzly bears was documented in the film \\"Grizzly Man.\\" <br /> <br />Krakauer is a good writer, which is important, because he has to navigate and filter through a lot of material in order to find the right combination of elements that will entertain and inform the reader.  <br /> <br />In general, I think Krakauer chose wisely by focusing as much as possible on the extraordinary exploits of \\"Supertramp,\\" notably when he abandons his car in the desert, and the time he spent in Alaska. In order to beef the text up to book length without getting boring, Krakauer dips into stories of others who have been caught in nightmarish survival situations, and their stories are told to great effect. <br /> <br />My only criticism is that Krakauer reveals a bit too much of his own self in the book. Personally, I was interested in McCandless, and self-oriented psychoanalysis by Krakauer is something that I could have done without.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a strong effort, and I look forward to more books by Krakauer. I'd recommend this for someone who enjoys tales of the great outdoors, but who would like to go beneath the surface of the grisly details for a more introspective approach. <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|Ok, I bought it for me, but it has been hijacked by my 12 year old daughter.  She plays it over and over.  If you listen to pop radio, you will recognize three of the songs.  For you older listeners the Killers have a sound that is very similiar to the British Invasion sound of the '80s.  Some songs sound like the Cure and others like Duran Duran, but all are easy to listen to.   <br /> <br />I wonder when I get my CD back.
B00000K3CM|4.0|Home Alone is one of my favorite movies; the music was good, it was funny, the acting was great, and the booby traps were a hit. Now, I don't mean to sound harsh, but a sequel wasn't necessary. The plot is filled with so many fake plot twists and things that would never happen, but they do. Macaulay Culkin wasn't as good this time, but he could still act well. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were hilarious as the Sticky Bandits, their name changed this time. But when the expected booby trap sequence begins, it had stuff in it that could have made the movie PG-13 rated. I mean, shoud parents really let their kids see a sadistic kid throwing bricks at the burglar's heads from the 3-story rooftops? I was honestly a little sickened by this sequence, but there were some traps thatwere pretty funny (the cement bag was a kick). In the first film, the guys could have possibly lived, but in this one they survive things only a cartoon would. It's funny, yes, but sometimes upsetting (for example, the sink and the staples). I still think it's an easily watchable film for people wanting a mindless movie to unwind with after a hard day when you don't want to do any thinking. 'Nuff said.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|I like 50 Cent, but I didn't rush to the stores to buy the Massacre when it came out, and I'm glad I didn't cause this new version is a lot better in my opinion, I have heard the complete first album from my friend, the hot new joint with Mobb Deep is off the hook. I do miss Game, 50 made sure to take him out of this version, so if you like the Game, might as well keep the original version.  50 is not the greatest lyricist but you have to admit G-Unit is on a roll right now, and if you know anything about hip hop you know that it won't last forever, so while the music is hot that's when you have to buy, this is probably as good as is going to get, so enjoy!    the dvd is great, who cares of some of the videos are not high quality the fact that each track has a video is great, even tracks that you wouldn't listen to a whole lot are better when there's a video,  the disco inferno video does have nudity, and a lot of the other videos are gun shows, there are videos made using computer animated characters like Piggy Bank, and others using 50 upcoming video game scenes.    the dvd also includes a preview to 50 cents new game and a preview to his upcoming movie \\"get rich or die tryin'\\"
B00005JODA|1.0|I had high hopes for The Constant Gardner! Sure the cinematography and soundtrack are magnificent, but if that's all I wanted to see I'd rent a documentary, or nature program.<br /><br />Medical research is an issue that's near and dear to my heart! I worked many years in the pharmaceutical industry recruiting subjects for 100's of medical studies. Most were fairly harmless, some of them risky, others were plain ridiculous. I even participated in a  fairly risky study myself, (of course, it wasn't described that way), to atone for my sins. Real or imagined. Even though I worked there for years, one of the doctors conducting the study told me a bald face lie in order to \\"convince\\" me to participate. His obvious deception did not stop me from participating in the trial, since money was not the motivating factor. As a result, I, along with many others, experienced temporary, but severe side effects. The study was eventually yanked, and thankfully that particular vaccine never saw the light of day! So one can only imagine the utter nonsense that goes on in Third World countries, or in poor communities, here, in the good-old U.S. of A. with regards to medical research. But that's a story for another day!<br /><br />While abusing folks to make money is nothing new to capitalism, this is the first time Hollywood tried to tackle  the pharmaceutical industry, head-on. The problem with this movie, besides the disgusting scenes of violence and death, is the extremely pessimistic message: If you expose the pharmaceutical industry, or any other powerful transnational corporation, you can expect to be either  murdered; tortured AND murdered, if you're really unlucky; or essentially commit suicide because you're depressed from losing a loved one.<br /><br />The ending was also lousy for other reasons. Suggesting even if you blow the whistle rather dramatically in public, you will never know what happens to the bad guys in the end. It's left to your imagination. Other rotten messages are: Western governments are totally corrupt. You have no friends among your colleagues,  when the chips are down. In order to be a successful activist, you must keep your spouse clueless of the dangers, ad nauseam! Wow! Who the hell, but a fool, would want to side with the poor and the downtrodden, if death and self-destruction is all you're going to get in return?<br /><br />Hollywood, you will sell a lot more tickets by by writing your fiction with a bit more hope.

0380729407|4.0|<br /> <br /> The Book Something Wicked this Way Comes, by Ray Bradbury, is a great novel that shows a person quite a lot of life lessons that will guide him through life.  In this  <br />book; there is a different kind of witting style compared to other writers.  The genre of this book is scary but if you understand the situations, each character is going thru its not  <br />frightening, is more of a mystery you want to solve.  I would encourage you as a reader to go pick up this book and read it. <br />        William Halloway and James Nightshade are thirteen-year-old boys living in a green town, Illinois.  They are going to turn fourteen in a week.  However, a tragedy happened that changed this two boy's life.  A storm was warned to them  <br />that was coming to there village.  The two boys go to wills father which is in the library to get some books.  Wills father feels to old and he's is only fifty-four and he wants to be young like his boy and be able to run and have fun.  Charles and William find out about a carnival coming to there town the next day.Wills father see's a sign in a store right around the corner of the library it read  <br />\\"Cooger & Darks Pandemonium shadow show\\" and Jim and will mysteriously found one like that also.  They two boys paid no attention because they were too excited about the carnival not for long though.  Charles had this weird feeling in his tummy about going to this carnival or not Mr.Halloway is concerned that this carnival came too late at a time were the man is <br />really close to death. <br />      The book has some parts were you just do not want to stop reading or leave yourself hanging.  Bradbury had a type of writing that you just do not find in any  <br />particular book. <br /> <br />
0060723513|1.0|I am sharing One Australians Perspective with you please read<br /><br />Frank Seeley<br /><br />Cultural Mutilation Uptop<br /><br />by Chris Sitka (Australia)<br /><br />Shortly after I arrived in the United States from Australia friends started asking me \\"What do you think of the book Mutant Message Downunder?\\" As this book is virtually unknown in Australia I decided to read it in order to give them an opinion. It soon became obvious why it is not a hit in Australia. Only people totally unfamiliar with Australia and the culture of its indigenous people would be taken in by the claim that this fantasy is reality.<br /><br />Marlo Morgan, the author, claims that this book is a documentation of her experience with a tribe of Australian Aboriginals who chose her to carry a message of great importance to the world. She describes a journey of several months across the Australian continent in which she is taught Aboriginal cultural secrets. I am told she now gives well attended workshops teaching the insights she says they asked her to convey.<br /><br />In one part of the book she is buried up to her neck in the sand to be cleansed of toxins. The fans of this book have the opposite problem. They have their heads buried in the sand. A large number of people are reading this book and have faith that its message is authentic. That is why I believe it is important for me to point out that this book a ridiculous fabrication.<br /><br />I am a white Australian of European descent. I do not have any Aboriginal blood in me. I have worked for and with Australian Aboriginals, including traditional elders. I do not claim to have been initiated or told any secrets of clan lore. I have learned much from them and from studying writings about their culture for over twenty years. I have been given a 'skin' name by women elders of the Western Desert Kukatja language group. This is necessary for them to be able to relate to and work with me. I do not claim that it in any way makes me Aboriginal. However I do believe that it gives me certain obligations. I see exposing the grossly inaccurate portrayal of Australian Aboriginal desert culture in Mutant Message as one of those obligations.<br /><br />The introduction to this volume, written by the author, is full of defensive claims about the authenticity of her story. No wonder. As an Australian who has spent some time walking out in the desert and relating to traditional Aboriginal people I found it hard to find any authenticity in the pages of this book. Revealingly, elsewhere in the introductory pages, it is described as a novel. However even novelists usually do research to make the setting of their story ring true.<br /><br />A feature of this poorly written novel (claiming to be fact) is that no locations are described by name. Even the author's pre-adventure stay in Australia's large cities is enveloped in secrecy. We never learn whether she wooed her Robert Redford look-a-like beau in Sydney or Brisbane or Cairns. We can only guess. A difficult job because she describes a city with the world's most beautiful natural harbour - presumably Sydney - where tropical cane toads abound. There are no cane toads in Sydney so perhaps we should assume that Cairns has miraculously obtained a harbour for the benefit of this writer.<br /><br />Marlo Morgan alludes to the fact that she was to spend five years in Australia but doesn't tell us how long she really was there. From her description of Australia I wonder if it was even a week. If indeed she was in Australia for a number of years, or even long enough to act out the events described in Mutant Message she must be very forgetful. It is more than suspicious that after describing in detail, from memory only, numerous conversations she had over four months with the nomad tribe she supposedly travelled with, the fact that you don't make phone calls with quarters in Australia slipped her memory. I wonder how come she forgot that in Australia we don't even have quarters as part of the currency.<br /><br />Towards the end of her account Marlo describes walking out of the desert and meeting a man on the edge of a city who gives her a quarter. Maybe he happened to have one and was just humoring an obviously flaky American. However she does claim to have made a call from a phone box with it. Sorry Marlo but you would have needed two twenty cent pieces and even that would not have been enough for the long distance call you describe making. Then follows an even more surprising description of how the New Age Mutant Messenger found her way back to civilization to convey the great wisdom she alone is chosen to impart. She has money wired from her office to the telegraph company nearby. I understand that in the States there is such an institution as a telegraph company and a telegraph office where wayward wanderers can pick up cash. But Marlo was describing an unnamed Australian city. In the interests of a more authentic sequel let me tell you there is no such thing in any Australian city.<br /><br />Perhaps this is being picky. I could mention any number of inaccuracies like this such as the description of Australians liking warm beer (that's England, Australians like it icy) and mere spelling mistakes (Quantas for Qantas, Foster's Lauger for Lager). Her descriptions of cutesy Australian scenarios and even the insulting sub-title downunder written upside down are designed to appeal to American readers' desire to see Australia as quaint and exotic. It would be just laughable to an Australian brought up on American Westerns and sit-coms if it were not for the core \\"message\\" of the book.<br /><br />When I first picked up Mutant Message and flicked through it I was prepared to believe that Marlo Morgan had some kind of experience with some Aboriginal people and had kind of stretched the truth out in the interests of self promotion. However a close reading leaves me in no doubt that she did no such thing. Almost every detail is false. This is blatant cultural appropriation in the interests of profit. If the author is not an out and out cynical operator she is sadly deluded.<br /><br />Her description of the tribe she crossed the deserts of Australia with bears little relation to any indigenous Australian people. She describes ornaments, musical instruments, cooking utensils, ceremonies, landscape, social relations, clothing and much else which simply do not exist anywhere in the traditional cultures of the Australian continent. She does claim that her tribe is a special, less corrupt, more highly evolved group than your average run of the mill Australian Aboriginal. It is still curious that her description of their culture bears no resemblance what so ever to any Aboriginal traditions. Instead her tribe practice numerous Native American customs. I would be tempted to believe that this was the story of a Native American tribe lost in Australia if Marlo Morgan had not herself assured us that they are Aboriginal.<br /><br />I could give you several dozen examples of this cultural inversion designed to make American readers feel at home. For example at one point she describes the women making an object that mystified me. It involved making a hoop and catching spider webs out of a tree. The origin of this one was revealed to me when I glanced through a New Age catalogue a couple of days after reading Mutant Message. Why, it was a Native American dream catcher!<br /><br />Most notable in this Americanization is the names she ascribes to the desert tribe's members. Storyteller, Tool Maker, Sewing Master, Big Music, Secret Keeper. This was my first indication that this book was suspect. This kind of naming does not exist in Aboriginal culture. People have names, but they are not translatable in this way. Nor is there such a thing as a specialist Tool Maker. Everyone makes their own tools. Many of the functions described in her fanciful names don't even exist.<br /><br />What's more people are rarely addressed by their personal names. People are commonly addressed by their 'skin' or kinship name. This term is shared by others of the same generation. The translation for Napaltjarri, my 'skin' name, is daughter-in-law to a Napanangka or grand daughter to a Napangarti. Even if there are six other Napaltjarris sitting within ten feet of me I am always addressed by that term. One's kinship is far more important than one's individuality. Even in language groups without strict 'skin' terms older people are called aunty or grandmother rather than their name.<br /><br />Never once does Marlo refer to having been given a 'skin' name or of herself in kin relation to the people she claims to have spent several months with. A strong kinship system is the dominant feature of all Australian Aboriginal traditions. In numerous instances I have witnessed traditional Australians unable to speak to or fully acknowledge the presence of a person without a 'skin'. They avert their eyes and mumble incoherently if forced to speak to a white person. As soon as it becomes obvious this person will be around for a while, and must be related to, they are given a 'skin' name so that relaxed communication is possible. Anyone outside the kinship system is virtually non-existent. Given the boasting in the rest of her novel it would be surprising if Marlo forgot to mention having been given a 'skin'. It is inconceivable that Aboriginal people would impart secrets to anyone without a 'skin'. Being given a name like Mutant is equally improbable. The concept of a mutation, a Western scientific term, is non-existent in Aboriginal culture.<br /><br />I have to wonder if Marlo Morgan has ventured out into the Australian desert at all. She does accurately describe the thorny nature of walking in the desert barefoot. I too have pulled thorns from my feet - but I knew what kind of thorns they were. Marlo obviously does not. She describes in detail walking for months on spinifex grass. Walking on spinifex grass is virtually impossible. It grows in large clumps, quite widely spaced, with red sand in between. Walking in the desert consists of walking around and between tussocks of spinifex. Yet Marlo several times describes walking on it as its sharp barbs dig into her feet. She must have very long legs, or the word walking means jumping in her unique dictionary. Why spend months jumping from tussock to tussock to cut your feet? In the interests of a good story? Why describe spinifex as a sharp lawn when it looks nothing like that? Could it be because you don't really know what spinifex looks like?<br /><br />Still Marlo is a woman of great stamina. I know no white people, including friends who have lived out in the desert for many years, who can walk all day in the summer sun without a hat. Almost every year someone, including numerous Aboriginal people, perish from trying to walk for help when their cars break down. The temperature range is understated in Marlo's account. Perhaps it was a particularly cool summer where the temperature did stay at 110 F. In any case, why did this group decide to walk from one side of Australia to the other in summer when the rest of their kin would have been resting in the shade of a desert oak?<br /><br />People living a traditional nomadic lifestyle rarely travelled outside their territory. Occasionally they would do so to visit another kinship group and for ceremonial exchanges. Travelling in another group's territory could only be done with permission from that group and for ceremonial purposes. No family group would have travelled thousands of miles from their own country, meeting no-one and thereby transgressing traditional law and neglecting ritual obligations to their own land.<br /><br />Here we get into dicey territory. In fact there are no more traditional nomads in Australia. If there were, then their survival skills would have to be finely honed because the ecology of the desert has been irrevocably altered by feral animals and plants introduced by the white invasion. The water table has been drastically lowered. Australia's desert Aboriginals have all been forced into settlements. It is vaguely possible that a group of 62 people as described in Mutant Message might have escaped detection and, unlike all their kin, avoided civilization. There was a group of four people who came out of the desert in Kukatja country in 1984. They would have been almost as surprised to meet Marlo Morgan's clan as they were by what they saw at the white mission settlement.<br /><br />They would be horrified to see the number of possessions lugged around by Marlo's clan. Desert nomads wore no clothes and carried very little with them. She describes them as wearing clothes, carrying sleeping skins, skin water bottles, musical instruments, cooking utensils and any amount of paraphernalia. Unlike other desert peoples they boiled up brews of tea and manufacture menstrual pads, etc. Strangely such activities reminded me more of specific descriptions I recently read in Jean Auel's Valley of the Horses (set in Stone Age Europe) than any Aboriginal nomads.<br /><br />Marlo claims to have been taught many wisdoms by her guides. Yet she describes virtually none of the regular spiritual practices and day to day activities of actual desert people. Instead she inaccurately describes the meaning of concepts such as Songlines. (They are not a measure of distance.) Her people were not performing their ritual obligations. Instead of singing for the country they gave what Marlo describes as 'a concert'. Now I have seen an Aboriginal concert. It was organized by a white teacher at an ex-mission settlement. School kids sang European hymns translated into Pitjantjatjara and cowboy booted stockmen played Country and Western numbers on battered guitars. However a concert is a concept unheard of in traditional culture. People 'sing their country' in ancient chants accompanied by dance and sometimes sand drawings. Instead of experiencing and sharing with us her observations of such activities Marlo describes a very Western like concert for which her clan manufactures instruments never used in Australian traditions such as wind chimes and flutes. What's more they include in the concert a bullroarer which is a highly sacred instrument which women are forbidden to listen to. However it did appear in a Crocodile Dundee movie which may account for Marlo's familiarity with it. Likewise the percussive instrument of Australian peoples are the clapping sticks. They do not and did not use drums. Yet Marlo has them making drums.<br /><br />This concert occurs in a gorge which, by its description, would undoubtedly be a sacred place necessitating a real ritual ceremony. Aboriginal people would compulsively recount the Dreamtime (mythological) significance of such a place, but this is not mentioned. Instead it is called \\"the medicine of music\\", again a Native American term. Her pals compose music for the occasion and walk away saying \\"Pretty great concert.\\" and \\"Guess before too long I'll change my name to Great Composer.\\" Such ego intrusive behaviour is patently laughable to anyone who has been around any real Aboriginals performing ceremony for country.<br /><br />Of course this tribe even has a Western style therapist called Secret Keeper who listens to people's problems. Something for Mutant Message's fans to relate to. In case they still feel lost there is a sky being called Divine Oneness. Once again something that none of the other Aboriginal clans in Australia, who have a strongly earth focused spirituality and no god-like being, share with Marlo's crew. There are any amount of such White Western concepts put into Marlo's characters' mouths. One old woman says to her \\"I think you must come from outer space.\\" Outer Space? Has she been watching T.V.? She also puts into their mouths western concepts of free will, time and creation myths which include Noah's flood. There are even Eastern mystical concepts like celibacy (not an Aboriginal aspiration).<br /><br />Towards the end of the book Marlo says \\"I now have knowledge and understanding that is beyond anything I could have imagined for myself\\". To the contrary, I believe Marlo was fully capable of imagining every bit of it. Hardly any of the knowledge she describes in the book is anything like what I have heard come out of the mouths of traditional elders. It sounds much more like the personal philosophy of an American woman who is promoting the kind of pop psychology we have all read in numerous other New Agey publications over the last few years.<br /><br />The words that come out of the mouths of the characters in this book are Marlo Morgan's words. They do not reflect how a people living a traditional lifestyle express themselves. Even if Marlo did in fact talk to some desert people, which I seriously doubt, she can't have been listening to them. Anyway Aboriginals have an astute method of handling nosy people. They simply answer yes to every inappropriate question asked of them. This allows white people to remain secure in their own reality and deflects intrusion and hostility.<br /><br />Natural healing seems to be one of Marlo's passions. She claims to have learnt much from her travels and describes some extraordinary experiences. She portrays her guides as being extremely healthy due to their natural lifestyle. So much so that Great Stone Hunter had to deliberately break his leg so that they could show Marlo how to heal it. Though there were and still are Aboriginal healers, such romanticization draws attention away from the real tragedy of Aboriginal Australia's third world living conditions. Why would these people impart their powerful secret healing methods to a white American when their own Aboriginal kin, contrary to Marlo's description of them, are dying young of a large number of preventable diseases. The health conditions of Australia's Aboriginal population is an international scandal. She doesn't even get it right when describing the White Australian health system. Claiming that Australia has socialized medicine \\"with harmony between medicine and natural practitioners.\\" Sorry, not true. The Australian government is constantly banning use of herbs and homeopathy, etc. by allopathic doctors.<br /><br />On another tack, Marlo also gets the social organization of Aboriginal people all wrong. She has a character called Tribal Elder who is the chief. Native Americans may have chiefs but indigenous Australians do not. He seems to be her primary instructor. This would be most unlikely. Aboriginal culture is very sex segregated, especially when it comes to sacred teachings. Men simply do not instruct women. From puberty all women are instructed in their ceremonial obligations by older women. Ritual life is strictly divided into women's business and men's business. Some ceremonies involve both women and men performing separate parts of the whole, but the instruction for a woman would happen in the women's camp. Not that any actual ceremonies are accurately described anywhere in this book. The powerful connection to land never comes across. There is no dancing, no singing, no sand drawings and no Dreamtime myths. Even tourists often get to see more than was described in this book.<br /><br />The story of Marlo's \\"initiation\\" is patently unbelievable. Firstly she claims she was chosen because she had set up a business to help a group of young urban Aboriginals find employment. Something she claims they could not have done without her. A snide bit of racism there, as numerous Aboriginal groups are setting up businesses in Australia. She claims that before she invented them in the 1990s white Australians had never thought of fly screens despite the prolific number of insects. That is why her business venture, which is never named or located, was such a runaway success. The news for Marlo is that I had a fly screen on my bedroom window in the 1950s.<br /><br />No matter. A tribe of desert nomads was so impressed with this achievement, despite their lack of windows, that they chose her, of all people, to be their messenger. Ignoring many others who have dedicatedly worked for them for many years and speak their languages and understand their culture to a far greater extent than Ms Morgan, who shortly before her initiation says; \\"I knew very little about any of the Aboriginal groups ... I didn't know if they were a close knit race or if, like the American Indians, vast differences, including different languages, were common.\\" (p.3) More to the point; why not chose an Aboriginal person. Despite a decidedly racist passage in the novel which describes even urban Aboriginals as illiterate and without ambition (p.33) there are many Aboriginal writers and teachers and workshop presenters. There is even an Aboriginal owned and run publishing house (Magabala Books) which publishes the real words of real Aboriginal people e.g. Footprints Across Our Land - just released.<br /><br />Not to worry. Marlo was born with a deep psychic connection to the chief of a people with no chiefs. She is picked up and driven out to the desert and everyone is waiting, already painted up for a ceremony in her honor (in designs that resemble no others seen on Aboriginal people). She is robbed of all her possessions, tested by weird Las Vegas-like games and virtually kidnapped into the desert. All within a matter of hours.<br /><br />Usually any real introduction to Aboriginal ceremonial culture takes a long time of building up trust. It demands patience. On arrival in an Aboriginal camp as a stranger it is quite likely that no one will talk to you much for days or weeks or months. There is no such thing as fast track teaching in this timeless land.<br /><br />It is even more unlikely that they would take a white person's clothes, expensive watch and rings, burn them and then lead her off into the desert against her will. White people are approached with great caution. Aboriginals in the desert still remember their people being shot and poisoned in mass slaughters, women being raped, fathers being dragged off in chains. In their own lifetimes. In the present they live with summary injustice. Disproportionate numbers of their people die in legal custody each year. They are locked up for swearing in front of a white person. It is unlikely they would risk the wrath of a white person. If Marlo had decided she did not want an enlightening desert adventure they would have been in big trouble.<br /><br />Apart from the silly bits of this story there is a serious racist element to Marlo's fantastic tale.<br /><br />She claims that Uluru (Ayer's Rock) is no longer a site of \\"worship\\" and that no tribe but hers has any sacred ritual objects in existence. This is presumably to big note the special nature of her Real People, as she calls them. This is an insult and misrepresentation of the actual indigenous peoples of Australia who are performing traditional ceremonies and maintaining the sacred objects, songs, dances, designs and teachings against great odds. To purvey the lie that traditional culture is dead is to undermine their efforts to preserve their culture. To add injury to insult she makes statements like \\"Their population is declining by their own free will\\" and says they have decided to have no more children. Such untrue genocidal projections are a criminal assault against an ancient race struggling valiantly to survive under the dominance of a hostile white society which continues to find many ways to try to wipe them out.<br /><br />Marlo Morgan, while including puerile fragments of sympathy, litters her book with racist terms and statements: phrases such as half-cast, half-breed, native, dark skinned natives, cannibals and the way the word tribe is misused.<br /><br />She frequently describes the people as having animal-like hooves. She shows little human respect for the people she claims to have taught her so much.She remains a very superior, arrogant White. Her ego appears unbounded. Until she came along the Real People had \\"never before ... associated with a white person or even considered any kind of relationship with one.\\"(p.40) The text is littered with little nuggets of self praise \\"My friends always remarked how self sufficient I was.\\" (p.3)<br /><br />Sometimes this reaches absurd heights such as in the introduction where she states \\"This manuscript was a peaceful self published work which became controversial. Australia's top judicial body, the High Court, overturned the concept of \\"terra nullis,\\" which falsely contended the continent was unoccupied by civilization when British colonists arrived in 1788.\\" The assumption from these sentences is that her book influenced the High Court decision. I seriously doubt any one on the High Court has ever heard of her book. They have however heard of the countless Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people who have fought for Aboriginal Land Rights over the decades and demonstrated and spent large sums for the legal struggle. All of this effort counts for nothing apparently because it was Marlo Morgan who brought the High Court and the Australian people to enlightenment.<br /><br />Despite this claim, I know no one in Australia who has even read her book. She had a real gumption distributing it in Australia. I am not the only one who noticed the inaccuracies and inconsistencies. It did not sell well. The Aboriginal people greeted this book with outrage. The few accurate facts scattered sparingly amongst the rubbish in this volume were gleaned from reading books published in Australia. I could almost show you the pages they are taken from. There are several volumes describing bush foods and medicines, for example.<br /><br />Even though I accept that not many people in the United States are qualified to pick its faults I am surprised that they can take this book seriously. The writing is painfully bad. Anyone who has to use large blocks of capital letters to get her point across is an amateur and the self-serving egoism of the author is transparent. Perhaps her readers are drawn to the romantic notion of being taken in by a people still in touch with their ancient spirituality. Such surrogate experiences are very trendy and profitable at the moment. Yet the insights served up are hardly nourishing or original; e.g. \\"All life is one.\\" or \\"Mutants no longer have the good digestive system of the Real People.\\" (p.132) Wow. It is a very poor substitute for the profound spirituality of real, existent Aboriginal culture.<br /><br />I could go on criticizing this book for days. There is barely a page not full of suitable targets. Suffice to say that I urge you to discourage fellow Americans from taking it seriously. This is blatant cultural theft for self promotion and profit. It would serve readers much better to make a study of the true wisdom and insights available from traditional Australian Aboriginal culture which require respect and patience, not voracious greed and speed. Better still, a study of their own culture will lead White seekers to realise that devotion to profit and ego lead to unethical behaviour.<br /><br />In conclusion; Marlo Morgan, you owe the Aboriginal peoples of Australia a big apology accompanied by the donation of all your considerable income from this venture to the cause of Aboriginal Health and Land Rights.<br /><br />Chris Sitka<br /><br />P.S.: In 1996 a group of Aboriginal elders, seriously disturbed by the book's implications, received a grant to travel to the States and confront Marlo Morgan about her book and to try to prevent a Hollywoodisation of it. She admitted publicly that she had faked it but this received little publicity in the USA. The Aboriginal people are very angry that this book continues to be promoted and sold widely because it gives a very false picture of their traditional culture and of their current political and social status. This is very damaging to their very real struggle for survival.re are even Eastern mystical concepts like celibacy (not an Aboriginal aspiration). <br /> <br />Towards the end of the book Marlo says \\"I now have knowledge and understanding that is beyond anything I could have imagined for myself\\". To the contrary, I believe Marlo was fully capable of imagining every bit of it. Hardly any of the knowledge she describes in the book is anything like what I have heard come out of the mouths of traditional elders. It sounds much more like the personal philosophy of an American woman who is promoting the kind of pop psychology we have all read in numerous other New Agey publications over the last few years. <br /> <br />The words that come out of the mouths of the characters in this book are Marlo Morgan's words. They do not reflect how a people living a traditional lifestyle express themselves. Even if Marlo did in fact talk to some desert people, which I seriously doubt, she can't have been listening to them. Anyway Aboriginals have an astute method of handling nosy people. They simply answer yes to every inappropriate question asked of them. This allows white people to remain secure in their own reality and deflects intrusion and hostility. <br /> <br />Natural healing seems to be one of Marlo's passions. She claims to have learnt much from her travels and describes some extraordinary experiences. She portrays her guides as being extremely healthy due to their natural lifestyle. So much so that Great Stone Hunter had to deliberately break his leg so that they could show Marlo how to heal it. Though there were and still are Aboriginal healers, such romanticization draws attention away from the real tragedy of Aboriginal Australia's third world living conditions. Why would these people impart their powerful secret healing methods to a white American when their own Aboriginal kin, contrary to Marlo's description of them, are dying young of a large number of preventable diseases. The health conditions of Australia's Aboriginal population is an international scandal. She doesn't even get it right when describing the White Australian health system. Claiming that Australia has socialized medicine \\"with harmony between medicine and natural practitioners.\\" Sorry, not true. The Australian government is constantly banning use of herbs and homeopathy, etc. by allopathic doctors. <br /> <br />On another tack, Marlo also gets the social organization of Aboriginal people all wrong. She has a character called Tribal Elder who is the chief. Native Americans may have chiefs but indigenous Australians do not. He seems to be her primary instructor. This would be most unlikely. Aboriginal culture is very sex segregated, especially when it comes to sacred teachings. Men simply do not instruct women. From puberty all women are instructed in their ceremonial obligations by older women. Ritual life is strictly divided into women's business and men's business. Some ceremonies involve both women and men performing separate parts of the whole, but the instruction for a woman would happen in the women's camp. Not that any actual ceremonies are accurately described anywhere in this book. The powerful connection to land never comes across. There is no dancing, no singing, no sand drawings and no Dreamtime myths. Even tourists often get to see more than was described in this book. <br /> <br />The story of Marlo's \\"initiation\\" is patently unbelievable. Firstly she claims she was chosen because she had set up a business to help a group of young urban Aboriginals find employment. Something she claims they could not have done without her. A snide bit of racism there, as numerous Aboriginal groups are setting up businesses in Australia. She claims that before she invented them in the 1990s white Australians had never thought of fly screens despite the prolific number of insects. That is why her business venture, which is never named or located, was such a runaway success. The news for Marlo is that I had a fly screen on my bedroom window in the 1950s. <br /> <br />No matter. A tribe of desert nomads was so impressed with this achievement, despite their lack of windows, that they chose her, of all people, to be their messenger. Ignoring many others who have dedicatedly worked for them for many years and speak their languages and understand their culture to a far greater extent than Ms Morgan, who shortly before her initiation says; \\"I knew very little about any of the Aboriginal groups ... I didn't know if they were a close knit race or if, like the American Indians, vast differences, including different languages, were common.\\" (p.3) More to the point; why not chose an Aboriginal person. Despite a decidedly racist passage in the novel which describes even urban Aboriginals as illiterate and without ambition (p.33) there are many Aboriginal writers and teachers and workshop presenters. There is even an Aboriginal owned and run publishing house (Magabala Books) which publishes the real words of real Aboriginal people e.g. Footprints Across Our Land - just released. <br /> <br />Not to worry. Marlo was born with a deep psychic connection to the chief of a people with no chiefs. She is picked up and driven out to the desert and everyone is waiting, already painted up for a ceremony in her honor (in designs that resemble no others seen on Aboriginal people). She is robbed of all her possessions, tested by weird Las Vegas-like games and virtually kidnapped into the desert. All within a matter of hours. <br /> <br />Usually any real introduction to Aboriginal ceremonial culture takes a long time of building up trust. It demands patience. On arrival in an Aboriginal camp as a stranger it is quite likely that no one will talk to you much for days or weeks or months. There is no such thing as fast track teaching in this timeless land. <br /> <br />It is even more unlikely that they would take a white person's clothes, expensive watch and rings, burn them and then lead her off into the desert against her will. White people are approached with great caution. Aboriginals in the desert still remember their people being shot and poisoned in mass slaughters, women being raped, fathers being dragged off in chains. In their own lifetimes. In the present they live with summary injustice. Disproportionate numbers of their people die in legal custody each year. They are locked up for swearing in front of a white person. It is unlikely they would risk the wrath of a white person. If Marlo had decided she did not want an enlightening desert adventure they would have been in big trouble. <br /> <br />Apart from the silly bits of this story there is a serious racist element to Marlo's fantastic tale. <br /> <br />She claims that Uluru (Ayer's Rock) is no longer a site of \\"worship\\" and that no tribe but hers has any sacred ritual objects in existence. This is presumably to big note the special nature of her Real People, as she calls them. This is an insult and misrepresentation of the actual indigenous peoples of Australia who are performing traditional ceremonies and maintaining the sacred objects, songs, dances, designs and teachings against great odds. To purvey the lie that traditional culture is dead is to undermine their efforts to preserve their culture. To add injury to insult she makes statements like \\"Their population is declining by their own free will\\" and says they have decided to have no more children. Such untrue genocidal projections are a criminal assault against an ancient race struggling valiantly to survive under the dominance of a hostile white society which continues to find many ways to try to wipe them out. <br /> <br />Marlo Morgan, while including puerile fragments of sympathy, litters her book with racist terms and statements: phrases such as half-cast, half-breed, native, dark skinned natives, cannibals and the way the word tribe is misused. <br /> <br />She frequently describes the people as having animal-like hooves. She shows little human respect for the people she claims to have taught her so much. She remains a very superior, arrogant White. Her ego appears unbounded. Until she came along the Real People had \\"never before ... associated with a white person or even considered any kind of relationship with one.\\"(p.40) The text is littered with little nuggets of self praise \\"My friends always remarked how self sufficient I was.\\" (p.3) <br /> <br />Sometimes this reaches absurd heights such as in the introduction where she states \\"This manuscript was a peaceful self published work which became controversial. Australia's top judicial body, the High Court, overturned the concept of \\"terra nullis,\\" which falsely contended the continent was unoccupied by civilization when British colonists arrived in 1788.\\" The assumption from these sentences is that her book influenced the High Court decision. I seriously doubt any one on the High Court has ever heard of her book. They have however heard of the countless Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people who have fought for Aboriginal Land Rights over the decades and demonstrated and spent large sums for the legal struggle. All of this effort counts for nothing apparently because it was Marlo Morgan who brought the High Court and the Australian people to enlightenment. <br /> <br />Despite this claim, I know no one in Australia who has even read her book. She had a real gumption distributing it in Australia. I am not the only one who noticed the inaccuracies and inconsistencies. It did not sell well. The Aboriginal people greeted this book with outrage. The few accurate facts scattered sparingly amongst the rubbish in this volume were gleaned from reading books published in Australia. I could almost show you the pages they are taken from. There are several volumes describing bush foods and medicines, for example. <br /> <br />Even though I accept that not many people in the United States are qualified to pick its faults I am surprised that they can take this book seriously.The writing is painfully bad. Anyone who has to use large blocks of capital letters to get her point across is an amateur and the self-serving egoism of the author is transparent. Perhaps her readers are drawn to the romantic notion of being taken in by a people still in touch with their ancient spirituality. Such surrogate experiences are very trendy and profitable at the moment. Yet the insights served up are hardly nourishing or original; e.g. \\"All life is one.\\" or \\"Mutants no longer have the good digestive system of the Real People.\\" (p.132) Wow. It is a very poor substitute for the profound spirituality of real, existent Aboriginal culture. <br /> <br />I could go on criticizing this book for days. There is barely a page not full of suitable targets. Suffice to say that I urge you to discourage fellow Americans from taking it seriously. This is blatant cultural theft for self promotion and profit. It would serve readers much better to make a study of the true wisdom and insights available from traditional Australian Aboriginal culture which require respect and patience, not voracious greed and speed. Better still, a study of their own culture will lead White seekers to realise that devotion to profit and ego lead to unethical behaviour. <br /> <br />In conclusion; Marlo Morgan, you owe the Aboriginal peoples of Australia a big apology accompanied by the donation of all your considerable income from this venture to the cause of Aboriginal Health and Land Rights. <br /> <br />Chris Sitka <br /> <br />P.S.: In 1996 a group of Aboriginal elders, seriously disturbed by the book's implications, received a grant to travel to the States and confront Marlo Morgan about her book and to try to prevent a Hollywoodisation of it.

In the six weeks she's worked there, Shanna has seen one patient, and no blood was involved.<br /><br />What do you do when you're an immortal vampire who's lost a fang? Roman Draganesti faces the horrific fate of becoming a lopsided eater for all eternity, unless his fang is replaced before morning. So, what else can he do but look in the vampire Black Pages for a dentist?<br /><br />Unfortunately for Roman, it seems there are no undead orthodontists. He has no choice but to go to a mortal. What do you do when the mortal you've chosen has a mob contract on her head? You promise to protect her, of course! This decision by Roman causes a ripple effect upon vampires and mortals alike. A vampire hit man, a secret formula, and a CIA stake-out team, make for a very bumpy ride on the road to eternal love.<br /><br />How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire is the first book I've read by Kerrelyn Sparks and it was laugh-out-loud funny! The scene after Roman loses his fang is eye-wiping hilarious. A bored immortal, a phobic dentist, a lot of sparks, and you've got a recipe for a great read! I highly recommend this book to all the vampire lovers out there.<br /><br />Delia<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

B000819PKC|5.0|After getting this album and listening to it a hundred times, I came to one conclusion...  Time to get a portable music device!  I never missed my music on-the-go before, but I can't get enough of this \\"Dynamite\\"! Unlike their previous albums, I got into this one right away.  Before, I'd get the album, listen to it, put it away, then go back and play it about 6 months later and wonder why I haven't been listening to it for the past 6 months.  Eventually, I'll get their first two albums.  I didn't hear of Jamiroquai until the \\"Space Cowboy\\" remix and I've gotten every album since.  Maybe when I get \\"Emergency on Planet Earth\\" and \\"The Return of the Space Cowboy\\", I'll understand the comparisons to Stevie Wonder.  Personally, I hear the funk and spirit of Dan Hartman.
0393317552|5.0|This book is well worth reading. Its author, Jared Diamond, is what in my day was called a `cultural geographer', that is he is student of how the geo-physical environment effects the development of human society and its culture. In this book he attempts the heroic task of explaining the phenomenon of European world dominance from the 16th Century through most of the 20th Century in terms of geography and climate.<br /><br />Does he succeed? Well yes and no. In point of fact, as he himself admits, the geo-physical environment cannot completely explain the evolution of human societies which is much too complex to be explained so simply. What Diamond does do very well is explain the effect of geography and climate on food production, animal husbandry and cultural diffusion (i.e. the spread of agricultural techniques and technology in general). In the course of doing so he discusses such interesting phenomena as the role of population densities on technical development and disease resistance. His basic thesis is that Europe (and by extension North America, Australia and New Zealand) became dominant because of a geo-physical environment highly suitable to food production and that Europe's population density and cultural diversity created a breeding ground for both diseases (and disease resistance) and technological innovation. More controversially, he maintains that China's backwardness until the late 20th Century is entirely attributable to its monolithic culture and, expect for short intervals, its unified political system.<br /><br />I have one caveat for readers of this book. It does not provide a fact filled, irrefutable proof that human history can be explained entirely in terms of geography and climate. Diamond, I am certain, would be dismayed if anyone thought so. It does provide the engaged reader with a fascinating and plausible theory of how geography played one of the key roles in the evolution of human society
B000AADYRQ|4.0|There are a few bands out there right now(The New Pornographers comes to mind)that put out consistently decent to brilliant material.  Death Cab For Cutie is one of those bands.  They are accessible from so many different angles that just about anybody could find at least one redeeming quality about this band.<br /><br />\\"Plans\\" has many redeeming qualities about it, all of which are trademark DCFC: the weight of the lyrics (thanks, Gibby), the dense atmospherics, and pop sensibility to name but a few.  This makes \\"Plans\\" as good an album as anything else DCFC has released, with the possible exception of \\"Transatlanticism\\" which is understandably hard to replicate.  This new album is certainly worth your time and energy though.  Check out \\"Different Names For The Same Thing\\", \\"What Sarah Said\\", and \\"Brothers On A Hotel Bed\\" for starters.<br /><br />If there is anything that prevents \\"Plans\\" from being a 5 star record, it's simply that the ebb and flow of the music is a bit more predictable than in past recordings.  On a couple of occasions (Your Heart Is An Empty Room, I Will Follow You Into The Dark), you can feel exactly what's coming next.<br /><br />Allmusic.com put this album in their \\"autumnal\\" mood category, and that seems to be a very fitting adjective for a band that is known for its ethereal and dense texture.  Despite all the bickering over label changes and slick production, the essential Death Cab sound is still present, and yet as \\"autumnal\\" perhaps suggests, is slowly changing too.  Buy the album and listen to how the band is starting to evolve. It may be 4 stars by Death Cab standards, but compared to the other stuff on the shelves these days, it's solid 5 star material.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|Your probably reading some reviews and considering buying the Chariot CD from Gavin Degraw...I bought this disc on the way home from a business trip..so I got a chance to really listen to it and I was not impressed it was just ok....Months went bye and I would play the album a time or two still the album was just ok. Then one day I put in the \\"Bonus CD\\" called stripped it has almost all the songs as the album but with less production and changes. I listened to this CD 5 times in a row, it was that good. The songs flow more freely and has a tottaly different feel, it is not an acoustic version of the songs..sounds like it was gonna be the original album, but they rerecorded it with a different producer. I still think the \\"Chariot CD\\" is just OK however the \\"Chariot Stripped\\" is an excellent album. So if you decide to buy the Gavin Degraw CD do yourself a favor and get a copy with the Bonus CD \\"Stripped\\" as of this writing they still offer it new for the same price..
B000002AZ8|5.0|Starting with this amazing diverse butt kickn' piece of an album! Vitology is not a classic Pearl Jam album and none of their albums to follow were nearly as famous and heard more then Ten. Ten is a great album, but seriously the only Pearl Jam I ever hear on the radio is from Ten. I think the radio is evil, because it picks what you should hear and you never hear the more unknown songs that well deserve being called classic PJ hits. I love Pearl Jam and think they are a great band. I love diversity in an album and most of my favorite albums by my favorite bands are diverse ones, it keeps my attention longer when theres a change hear and there. Vitology should be classic. I think they got better musically diverse after Ten and Vs. They risked quite a bit when making this album. I think they mostly did this one for themselves and didn't care what people thought about it, but knew that plenty of people that respected a little change musically in a band would buy it, cherish it and rock out to it. Loyal fans would go all the way with them. This is one band I plan to, because their last album Riot Act was better then I thought it would be, so lets hope they keep putting out good albums, atleast a couple more. Pearl Jam is a band where it's hard to choose a favorite album to. There is just something Vitology, No Code and Yield had that made them a little more special then Ten and Vs. I think Pearl Jam got better with age and experiance then the likes of Smashing Pumpkins, which kinda weakened after Mellon Collie and I actually like Soundgardens earlier music more, but on the other hand Nirvana seemed to always get better with each album, imagine if they were still at it. Then again I do like the Foo Fighters. Anyways, yet their last two efforts, still pretty awesome, weren't as impressive as the middle three. As for the unique, diverse, trying out more then just grunge Vitology, a song by song review...<br /><br />Last Exit - Great opening rocker, got me hooked right away, should be a PJ classic.

0895260131|5.0|>>>>>>>Robert Spencer, who sits on the board of a group dedicated to propagandizing and converting Muslims into christians, has written a book for those people whose dream is to expand the war on terrorism into a war on all heathen muslims. The book isn't really research into Islam, its black propoganda using isolated quotes from Islamic works. The research is at the level of most books that try to demonize other religions and convert believers away from their religion.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br /> <br />This is a quote from the reviewer \\"Jack Jones.\\" How is this supposed to help the reader? This is not a review but a baseless accusation. I have personally heard Mr. Spencer on an interview stating that he does not wish to convert any Muslims into Christianity, \\"It is entirely impossible.\\" I am surprised that critics of this book are vehemently attacking the book without actually going to the Jihadist websites and Islam Q&A sites to really understand the inside knowledge of Islam from the real and practicing Muslims.  <br /> <br />If one wants to read the fairytales about how great the world is and how Islam is a Religion of Peace , perhaps you should be picking up books from Karen Armstrong and the ilk. <br /> <br />This book is not for children. It is an honest look at the threat of Jihad teachings inherent in the 7th century Saracenic ideology. The Crusades were brutal and ruthless, and this book is not denying any of it. It is merely focusing on the reality, because only when one ask the question what happened to Assyria, Coptic Egypt, Eastern Roman Empire, Persia, and Hindustan will one understand the eminent threat of Jihad we are facing today. <br /> <br />Perhaps no one in history had ever felt the \\"Sword of Allah\\" more than the Hindus of the once thriving Kingdom of Hindustan. Professor K.S. Lal stated that, \\"80 million Hindus vanished during the 500 years of Islamic rule.\\" Buddhist universities were destroyed. While monks were asked about the Buddhism scriptures, those unfortunate souls who could answer the questions were beheaded. Buddhism was effectively driven to extinction in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan.  <br /> <br />Since the critics are sounding more and more like propaganda and the broken record that is repeating a million times over, I would like to invite those, who feel they have the knowledge of Islam, to come to the ex-Muslim discussion forums. You can find them at [...] and [...]  <br /> <br />Please, come and take a shot if you deem you know more about Islam than ex-Muslims. It is said, \\"No one knows more about Islam than an ex-Muslim.\\"

B000069HKH|5.0|It has taken me a good bit of time to get to Springsteen's \\"Rising\\" CD because I always felt his \\"best days\\" were long behind him and his recent work left me uninspired.  Also, I remained steadfastly unwilling to listen to 9/11 \\"tribute\\" CDs in general.  As a New Yorker who was there on the day and witnessed the towers imploding first hand, that event has remained so fresh in my mind for way too long.  I saw all attempts to memorialize it as opportunistic at best.  So several months ago I decided to give \\"The Rising\\" a chance and to jump in and give it a listen.  It took a few listens, but ultimately I have come to love what I was hearing.  I was able to listen and see a broader perspective than just 9/11 -- but also a testament to what is happening all over around the globe, not just America.  BUT, that said, this being a week or so after Hurricane Katrina, the CD's power and relevance is eerie.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City blazes into new territory like movies like Pulp Fiction and The Matrix Trilogy.  Refreshingly new and different which Hollywood doesn't inspire.  A movie that is outside of the normal box of Hollywood.  I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection, you won't be disappointed.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|If you saw Saturday Night Live with Will Ferral as host in the Spring of 2005, you would have seen Queens of the Stone Age play two songs: \\"Little Sister\\" (COWBELL by Will Ferral) and then \\"In My Head\\".  I had never heard Queens stuff before and I fell in love with these two songs. Upon recieving Lullabies, I realized that they are the ONLY two songs that I love.  Again, I wasn't a fan of the band, and I have checked out their music-pretty decent-but not up to the quality and melodic presence as Sister and Head.  They are touring with Nine Inch, so maybe hearing all their stuff live will change my mind.

He has bought and sold businesses throughout his career, and amassed great wealth, yet you would not know it to see him on the street or even if you lived in his neighborhood.  He recommended that everyone read this book, and realize that \\"real\\" wealth is not shown in the things you buy, but in the ability one has to support his/her family should a steady pay check stop.

B000002MUQ|4.0|You know, Sammy Hagar once auditioned to be lead singer of the band Kansas! This is when their keyboardist Kerry Livgren fell out with their lead singer Steve Walsh because Walsh wasn't Christian and Livgren was. So imagine if Sammy had got the gig! So it'd be like he sings ''I love Jesus, I am looking forward to eternity...'' then when the songs over he lights up a cigar and says to the audience 'righto folks I'm gonna go out the back and sleep with a few beautiful women then I'll be back in half an hour to sing you some more Christian songs!' (?). But such a personality clash was required on the album Balance.     I mean, come on, it was the mid-90's, everyone hated glam-rock 'cause Kurt Cobain hated glam-rock and Van Halen was going to resurface with their hard-rock songs about what everyone thought was 'Big Dumb Sex'. And come on, these guys weren't from Seattle, so who wanted to know about them? But, you know, Samantha Hagar and co somehow pulled off such a transformation. Kurt who?    Well I don't know any glam-rock band that could sell a double platinum album at that time, even if that was poor sales by comparison to their earlier albums. But the material wasn't glam rock anyway. But how do Van Halen turn in a pop-rock-grunge-alternative album in the mid-90's and still make it seem like a genuine Van Halen artifact? Oh who knows? But they did it. So kudos to Hagar.    And speaking frankly, I like how this album opens the horizons for the band. The variety, moving past the boundaries and checking out new styles and stuff. And the songwriting's good and the guitar is quite heavy at times, so it's not a wimp-out. Actually it's a well realised album that is fairly enjoyable from beginning to end, with quite a few highlights and only a couple of lowlights. Rating ***1/2, or 3.5 rounded up in the heading to 4.
019280264X|5.0|Mansfield Park has it all. Of course it has Austin's dexterous English, but it also has the social commentary of class and gender which we also expect from her. It has all the feel of a retrospective, and it is remarkable in the extreme that Austin saw her own world with eyes so very like our own. If the quintessence of the creative writer's craft is the development and maintenance of tension, then this is the quintessential Austin novel, and possibly her best. We ache for Fanny when she is transported from her home as a young girl and fails to find either comfort or happiness in the manor house of her aunt and uncle. We are as edgy as the characters themselves as they mount a home theatrical production which places in relief each of their deficiencies, and foretells the guileless decency of our young protagonist. Our nerves are as knotted as hers when the scheming and fabulously wealthy Crawford stalks her, brandishing matrimony as a weapon. And even as we are turning the final dozen pages, the faulty judgment of Fanny's love interest, her cousin Edmond, instills lingering doubts as to whether a satisfying outcome is achievable. Let me provide a preview of Austin's delicious language and the underlying tension it conveys: \\"The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind was ruffled, and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony.\\" And here Austin portrays the controlling male mindset in dealing with their female marionettes: \\"In thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking merely of her health...he might mean to recommend her as a wife by showing her persuadableness.\\" And just how depraved is Mr. Crawford? \\"Curiosity and vanity were both engaged, and the temptation of immediate pleasure was too strong for a mind unused to make any sacrifice to right...he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose smiles had been so wholly at his command; he must exert himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny's account [for rebuffing him]; he must get the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram [her maiden name] again in her treatment of himself.\\" In Mansfield Park, we have pure evil in a position of commanding power, pitted against a powerless angel. And one by one, the angel's natural allies line up against her. There are a hundred paths to disaster, and only one to the sweetest victory.o subdue so proud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny's account [for rebuffing him]; he must get the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram [her maiden name] again in her treatment of himself.\\" In Mansfield Park, we have pure evil in a position of commanding power, pitted against a powerless angel.

B000002LPD|2.0|Van Halen were always a lot of fun. But with this album the fun was kind of going out of them. We know the VH guys love chicks, but to actually call an album FV(K, I mean it seems like a big point to be making. It wasn't fun anymore, it was a statement. And this album feels like a statement.     I should reiterate that this album is actually Van Halen's most preofessionally delivered album, and it won a grammy for best hard rock performance, which it probably deserved. The band is tight and professional here. They stretch out a bit too. But it just ain't fun anymore!  And it wasn't the 80's anymore. It was the 90's. That was the BIG change from the last album.     Well, there is good material, but while the last album felt like a collection of songs, this album defintiely feels like an album, but too many of the songs just sound the same. I mean right smack dab in the middle of the album you get three slow-medium songs that all make or break the 5 minute mark. 'Pleasure Dome' is an eerie medium paced rocker with a complex but great drum beat, and it's a more daring song for the band, with some unusual time signatures, and some strange spoken vocals. There is a lot of complex guitar soloing that drags the song out to almost seven minutes. This is followed by 'In 'n' out' a very average, by the books rock song, but it lasts for six minutes, and while 'Man on a mission' is a bit better, it still lasts 5 minutes. So thats 18 minutes of fairly ordinary medium paced rock, and that can't be a good thing. This is one fo the most electrifying rock bands in the world, so what in the worlds going on? But at least those three songs are followed by the genuinely electrifying 'The Dream is Over'. I wanna give a big shout out to this song, it simply flat out rocks! What a freakin' heavy intro, man that rocks your socks off, and that guitar solo in the middle of the song, that's so electrifying, as is the line about 'It's a RIP OFF!!'. And yet the chorus actually sounds like alternative rock, with kinda gospel backing vocals. It shows that Van Halen were an open minded band that could change with the times, without selling out. Anyway, they had sold out long ago...    The opening 'Poundcake' is also an excellent song, and the closing 'On top of the World' is a joyous exuberant pop-rock song with a great melody. However, 'Spanked' and 'Run around' are sex songs that lack wit and feel matter-of-fact. 'Judgement Day' is such an angry song it hardly feels like Van Halen, and I never have liked the preachy 'Right Now', the piano is great near the start but this song is a power ballad that bands like 'Styx', 'Kansas' and 'Boston' had delivered in handfuls over the years, albiet without as much adulation. I guess this song is one of the better ones, nut nothing is really really bad. However, the overall effect of this album makes it worth about 2 1/2, rounded down this time.
1573223085|4.0|I thought this book was an excellent supplement to much of the current liturature on economic and social trends in the U.S.  While identifying trends that are changing our economy (for a more astute analysis of these trends you should read The World is Flat by Thomas Friedman), it offers a positive and practical way to respond that is not fear based or offers us only the past.  Instead it takes us through a way to think about the future and the skills needed to succeed.  I'd recommend this book to anyone at the beginning or middle of his/her career, as well as to parents who are concerned with their children's education path. <br /> <br />It is an easy read (in fact it is a little repetitive), and it includes practical exercises to help everyone better understand the concepts presented.
0140185232|5.0|What struck me most about this book was how well thought out the characters and their motives were. I had my reservations about this book due to the way that Maugham started it out, describing a character that in the end was of no real consequence and basically only served to introduce us to Larry and Isabel. To be perfectly honest I rather disliked Elliott and at first found the story difficult to get into because of my dislike for his character. I think that this had to do with the fact that I could not connect with him and I would have to say that I do not believe it had anything to do with Maugham's writing.<br /><br />Once we see Larry for who he really is I felt myself growing fond of him. I thought that his character and story was the most interesting in the book. I instantly liked him for the fact that he seemed so determined to do what he felt he needed to do for himself. He did not allow himself to be swayed by his family members and friends when he figured out what he wanted to do.<br /><br />Isabel was a semi-interesting character that at first did not peak my interest because I thought her a silly little girl but she grew on me over time. What I liked most about her character was that even after there was no hope she continued to love Larry as passionately as was possible for a human being. I do admit though that the only time I liked her was when she and Maugham were sitting together talking. Most of the time when she was with other people she changed, put on a facade that I did not at all like. I had very little respect for her because of this.<br /><br />My favourite things about this book were the moments whenever Larry was on the pages and the ending. I found myself thinking that the ending was one of the most perfect things about the book.<br /><br />As a whole `The Razor's Edge' was very, very well written and easy to follow.<br /><br />This book is easily one of my favourites and I would have to say Maugham's greatest achievement.
B000002KB8|4.0|Although the group did not have the benefit of the experience of having recorded a previous album, it displays the powerful stirrings of an awakening metal Titan. The guitar riffs are very close in quality/inspiration to the soaring archetypal metal motifs that were to be born on the groups    followup \\"Paranoid\\" album. Toni Iommi's guitar licks were shockingly different from other guitarists of the day. Ozzy's voice was huge in it's panoramic sonic range and his ability to inject beautiful melody into this growling aural \\"barrage band\\". <br /> All in all, this album is a must for the serious Sabbath fan who wishes to have complete understanding of the evolution of this elemental superhuman metal juggernaut.
1400031087|5.0|I am usually turned off by funky punctuation or gimmicky-looking writing which I was warned was one element of this book, but I found the story flowed easily and I was quickly hooked. It felt like a genuine peak into what the world of rehab can be like.

B000002IOJ|5.0|What can I say...Testament rules, this came out in 1989 after The New Order, this one is more melodic than The New Order, better production, everything is better, not much to say about it, Once you hear the title track, and Skolnicks shredding solo, you know what you're in for, other standout tracks, Perilous Nation, and The Ballad, they are all good though...I wish I could say more, but I can't, it's just a great album
0380729407|3.0|Something Wicked this Way Comes is a story of mystery.  If you like spooky and curious novels, you are going to like this one. Something Wicked this Way Comes has events you probably want to know who the bad person is and what is going to happen.  I did not really understand the story in the beginning; because my opinion is that, the author goes from talking about a character and does not click with the rest of the story.  The Novel is good to read though, because when you get closer to the end the story has a lot of suspense, and makes the story more exciting and interesting to read.  The story has details that explain how the characters and setting look like.  You can picture the theme of the story easily.  Something Wicked this Way Comes is about two close friends that find out a secret magic that the carnival has.  The two boys then are hiding in dark places and do not trust no one.  They hide, because the carnival freaks are trying to hunt them down!  If you choose to read this novel, read each chapter carefully, because if you do not you will get lost and would not know what is happening.
B000002IMG|5.0|Released in 1988 after the killer debate (The Legacy), this album is even better, the production is a bit better, it has some melodic intros, something The Legacy did not have, Chuck Billys vocals are even better, this album is melodic and furious at the same time, many consider this to be their best, but I think their best to be the following album (Practice What You Preach), but this release is an essential in any Thrash collection, the best songs are Eerie Inhabitants, The New Order, Trial By Fire and Into The Pit, buy this album, you won't be dissappointed if you like Thrash.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|This albulm is alright but it's not the best. Bat Country will be their claim to fame on this albulm but for anyone out there who doesn't know and says \\"Why did he stop screaming?? He sucks now!!\\" needs to know that he bursted a blood vessel and because of that he can't sing or he will lose his voice at an early age. Because of this he chose to sing at a lighter level and obviously keep his voice. However, I think they should have quit after their first two CD's but money is money in this world. And whoever said Pantera...haha.

What a classic.<br /><br />Goodnight Moon is a great combination of art work and story, and should be on every new parents \\"must buy\\" list. Our family has most likely read this book together over 200 times.
0156027321|2.0|It's very hard for me to admit this, but I couldn't finish this novel.  This is a rare thing for me as a lover of literature and as a writer of fiction.  I always try to learn as much from other authors as I possibly can.  My apologies, Mr. Martel, I'm sure this was a wonderful book for someone interested in its premise, but I was not one of those people.<br /><br />The book began rather captivating enough.  In fact, I was quite delighted with it and thought I had discovered a gem.  The contemplations upon differing religions and zoos invigorated my thoughts.  However, the book quickly took a turn for the mundane and stayed uneventful for a long number of chapters.  I would have loved to find out the ending of the story, but I can only read about the daily struggles of a boy trapped on a lifeboat for so long.  Keep in mind this is coming from someone who takes pride in sticking novels out to the very end, no matter what.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked the film Cast Away, you'd probably enjoy this novel.  However, if you found yourself tapping your foot through said film, I'd pass on Life of Pi.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]
B00000IPAX|5.0|I am writing this review to tell you how good this album is.

1565117808|3.0|Life of Pi written by Yann Martel is a fictional novel.  If you like to read non-fictional    <br />books, this is probably not the right book for you.  However, if you like to read fictional novels,  <br />you should read this one because it teaches you many good things that are useful in your life.  <br /> I think that this book is good for people who can stay interested in long books.  If you  <br />can't stay interested in long books, this is not the right choice for you.  This book should be read  <br />with a dictionary to your side so that you can refer to it at any time.  It has many eloquent words  <br />that are not very common, that is why you should have a dictionary while you are reading it.  At the beginning, it is somewhat boring, but then the good parts come.  That's the same for all the books so that doesn't really matter.  <br /> This novel is about a boy named Pi who was named after a swimming pool.  He was  <br />trapped in the middle of the ocean with a 450-pound tiger.  He had to struggle a lot in order to  <br />reach his goal which in this case was getting to land. This book was emotional at the end so I am not going to go into details so that I won't spoil the ending.  <br /> The book teaches the reader a very important lesson.  The lesson consists of struggling  <br />and working hard in order to get what you want.  This relates to us because we have learned this  <br />at KIPP.  This is also a very good book to learn from because even though we might be scared or  <br />afraid to do things, we have to keep on working towards ours goals.  We need to put those fears  <br />aside and make sure that we do everything in order to accomplish our goals. <br />
B0000399WC|3.0|Franklin J. Schaffner's \\"Papillon\\" is one of those movies that you will only see once. Despite the film's epic scope, it is overly long and slow. Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffmann do give great performances, but the characters are pretty much there as an afterthought, swallowed in the bowels of this slow art film. There are definitely moments in the film that could've been removed, and the main story wouldn't suffer.<br /><br />Recommended only for Hoffman and McQueen fans. As for others, I recommend another film from Franklin J. Schaffner: \\"Patton.\\"<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: C+
0553212621|3.0|I've been catching up on classics by taking advantage of the Barnes & Noble \\"Buy Two, Get One Free,\\" and started with LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER.  Instead of being generic paperback volumes, each book has an new introduction along with explanatory footnotes and interesting appendixes.<br /><br />Anyway, I finished LADY but had some misgivings about the novel.  I didn't care for the ending because I felt the story just sputtered out.  From what I understand, Lawrence was dying at the time he was writing this, so can anyone better versed in his life tell me if this was a factor?  (Or did I just miss something?)<br /><br />I realize that he was trying to say something new about sexuality, and that the brazen affair between Connie and Mellors wouldn't necessarily end in despair and death, but it felt like a lot was left hanging.  I felt that most of the novel was constructed very well, but I didn't get that feeling by the end.<br /><br />I also now know that Andrew Dice Clay could've scored a respectable country lady if he had lived 100 years ago.<br /><br />I felt that there was a conflict between Connie and Mellors that was only touched on but not played out: she was quite in love with him for his crude way of discussing sex and his \\"tenderness\\" in lovemaking, but he never appeared to feel very deeply for her.  At times, he even sounded dismissive of any feelings at all.  And the vulgar way in which he talked to her hardly sounded like a great lover but more of a disrespectful player, so it was hard to want to see these two end up together.<br />(I also questioned Mellors' honesty at the way he kept turning on and off his accent).<br /><br />I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't put it up with MADAME BOVARY or even Henry Miller's TROPIC OF CANCER.<br />But I will buy the DVD of the English mini-series directed by Ken Russell and check that out.

B0009QTS1M|2.0|Why use the names of real people if you are not going to follow  real hisorical data? This movie is mostly fiction, it would have not hurt the story to stop pretending that it was non-fiction. Movies like this just confuse the \\"popular\\" uneducated public.

B000646MNE|4.0|I am so happy about my purchase. <br /> <br />I just go through season 1.

B0009S4IHY|2.0|Kung Fu Hustle is a really cheezy movie, with a bunch of badly acted stereotype characters. The Voiceover work is horrible, and only barely can be interpreted as being the same dialogue as the subtitles show (and probably even worse from the original chinese). <br /> <br />Despite claims to the contrary, it is not 'Crouching Tiger meets Looney Tunes'. The plot is nowhere as complex as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, there are scenes that seem to have nothing to do with the plotline at all, and some of the characters (especially the gay characters) are so ridiculously inslulting as to annoy me to an extreme. The Kung Fu was also pretty bad, the over use of wire work for humor side downright boring, and the reasoning behind what was going on even more ridiculous. <br /> <br />There's a point where funny becomes ludicrous and unacceptable... where I lose interest and can't regain it. This movie went there.
B00006AG5N|3.0|Even though Im only 16 I love Elvis. He was so talented though I thought this album had room for improvement.  The arrangement of the songs could have been better. I much prefered the second half of the album. 'In The Ghetto' , 'Crying In The Chapel' and 'A Little Less Conversation' are the high points of the album. It lacks life or something . I wish I could have given it more credit but then I wouldn't of been completely honest with you's. All I can say is ive heard better from Elvis Presley in the likes of 'Aloha in Hawaii'.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Let's face it, to me most double albums throughout the history of rock have been pretty good. The Beatles \\"The Beatles\\", \\"Electric Ladyland\\", \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", even \\"Speakerboxx/The Love Below\\" are all pretty darn good. If you would ask most people if the follow up to \\"Rumours\\", Fleetwood Mac's \\"Tusk\\", was a success they'd most likely say no. These people however would be very wrong. If you're a fan of Mac there's no reason that you shouldn't own this CD. Especially now that the album in it's entirety is on one CD, remastered. The album has 21 songs, I'll admit that there are some songs, mostly Lindsey Buckingham's that could be thrown away. These songs do however give the album it's uniqueness. The star of the album is Stevie Nicks. Her songs are as good as any in her or Mac's catalog. If you like Fleetwood Mac there's no reason you shouldn't have this in your collection. I enjoy \\"Tusk\\" just as much as \\"Rumours\\" and I think you will too.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|This is what I was waiting for all these yrs. I used to take my 3 1/2 yr old every week to see it in late 97 early 98...now shes 11 and wow....we are so excited... <br /> <br />I only wish we had the option to watch the movies with the deleted scenes inserted back into the movie ( kinda like what they did with \\"pearl harbor\\" ).  <br />Now dont get me wrong, I am going to enjoy see what had to be cut, but to be able to watch the film as it was filmed would have been nicer, no?? <br />I only hope that option is available......
B00042YC7Q|5.0|I first heard 'Malo' when in South America and was hooked immediately. Bebe's lyrics are beautifully multi-faceted- for example in 'Malo', her song about spousal abuse, she sings \\"please, don't shout, the children are sleeping.\\" A line which i'm sure many arguing couples have said which brings the subject that much closer to home. Pleasingly, she follows this submission by a foot-stomping, razor-sharp chorus which is a testimony to women's strength- \\"You don't do this to people you love... Don't think you're better than women\\". The album is dedicated to women who have been victims of abuse. <br />A major thing that stands out for me is Bebe's distinctive voice. Her accent is unashamedly Spanish and she has a delicious way of missing off her 'S's- making 'Mis Manos' sound like 'Mi Mano'- trust me, it sounds gorgeous, and her voice on the whole is incredibly impressive. She shows off her strength and range of voice to good avail on the melting-pot of songs on the album. Some may be put off having such a contrasting bunch on one album but Bebe pulls ot off with great panache and flair, comfortable slipping into whichever genre she chooses- and there are many- ska, soul, rock, rap, pop, and even a haunting acappella to finish the album off. Multifarious as it is, each song bears Bebe's already unmistakeable stamp. I can only hope to hear the same in her next album.
0684833395|3.0|I read this book based on a friend's recommendation that it was \\"the funniest book ever\\".  Sorry to say that I can't agree with her.  This is one of those books that does have some funny parts but that's it... these funny parts simply aren't delivered on a consistent basis.  Despite this, I did think that Heller did deliver a powerful message about the sheer absurdity of war.  Other than Yossarian (the main character), character development wasn't that strong but that's just my opinion.  Overall, I thought it was an average book and a bit of a letdown.
6304806418|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the music. Both Madonna and Antonio Banderos should have received Oscars for their performances.Highly recommend the production.
B0001EKZOQ|4.0|An excellent album.  I am not sure whether it qualifies as \\"album of the year\\" as some critics have labeled it, but it is good.  I have taken a star off because of the last entry: if El Cigala doesn't know Portuguese, he should have used a translation of the lyrics into Spanish or simply chosen a different song, but he does slaughter that beautiful language at the end!  However, if you do not know the language, enjoy the music and the singing.
0679737456|3.0|Black Ice by Lorene Cary takes place during the late seventies.  Libby is the main character and her story begins when her next-door neighbor tells her about an all boys boarding school who is deciding to accept girls.  Libby discussed the school with her mom.  Her mom thought it would be a great opportunity.  However, at first, Libby thought differently about it but she accepted the opportunity to make a new path in her life.  Therefore, she called the dean of admission and told him she would love to attend his school.  Would you like to know what happened during her rigorous journey at boarding school?  To find out you would have to read the book. <br />     I recommend Black Ice to any student who enjoys books about learning experiences.  Although, some of the content was difficult you can use your context clues to help you understand what the author's meaning was.  To grasp a full concept of this novel you have to read and critically think about it.  If you are a type of reader, who just flies through works of any kind and does not take the time to truly comprehend this is not the manuscript for you.  <br />     I enjoyed Black Ice but not as much as I thought, I would.  While, this novel kept me wondering and concerned about how Libby would turn out.  It just did not catch my attention when I began to read it.  However, many other students might enjoy Black Ice more than I did.  Many students like you can relate to the reality of this book.  It taught me if your teacher gives you a suggestion about how many classes, you should take you or how you should do any type of work, you should really consider their advice.

0062502174|4.0|If you like Jonathan Livingston Seagull... you would love this book. The book is easy to read, grabs the attention, good plot and great message. I really liked how Paulo tackled the barriers to acheive one's Personal Legend. His approach is simple to understand
078322740X|5.0|Hey guys! We are not plugging this movie well enough. If my wife didn't give me this for a birthday or something and I wasn't just in the mood to watch something different this evening I would have never picked up on this great little movie. We need to get the word out! My take: agreed this is a great team to pull this off. The non-surprise ending could have been so hoaky but they actually did it in a way I was glad Becky finally got left out of it. Let her find her own match if there is one. But I see a whole lot of depth in the whole point of this comedy. It is all true! None of this was a con. That is the beauty of it. The beauty of it is the con. This is so true in so many ways, and we love it and know we do. So the movie is not just cute, not just funny. It has a very serious point about life to make if we just see it. Didn't someone say something like \\"Heaven is all around you, you just don't see it\\"? You need the right story and things will be well.
B00011CZRE|1.0|This is not an original disc of the movie Seven. It will not even play in my area. I have never had an experience like this before and I have purchased DVD on e-bay with no problem. This person is a fake and I don't know what I have received.
B00000AF98|3.0|This is an okay album, with Paul Stanley singing 7 out of the 11 songs on it. Bruce Kulick does a pretty good job on No No No (giving Eddie Van Halen a run for his money in the speed department) but sacrifices feeling for technique in my opinion. The mix isn't the greatest, there's not enough bass to blend with the guitar and drums. Was Gene Simmons even playing on here, or did he just show up to sing his 4 songs? We all know he did play, it's just not there sonically. Eric Carr did a good job with this, proving again that he is a better drummer than Peter Criss. This album is symptomatic of the corresponding period in KISStory, with Paul being the main reason the band was even around. Not the best album, but not their worst either.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I don't even know where to begin here.  I just wonder if I watched the same movie as did the rest of those people that gave all these brilliant five star reviews.  This film is one of the dreariest pieces of celluloid that Hollywood ever put on.  It should be enbalmed because it never comes to life!  Its dead!  I will never understand how this came to be voted as the number one film of all time.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|If you like Girlmore Girls show, you will enjoy the Complete 2nd Season, especially without commercials!  You feel like you're living it with them, that you are in \\"Gilmore World\\".  It's a great show with well written characters.  My family enjoys the very fast paced wit and multi cultural references.  Fortunately, there's also reference booklets in the package to help you with the \\"Gilmorisms\\".

B00003CXCQ|5.0|It was almost 10 years after Walt Disney and the mouse he created became worldwide household names, that he gave Hollywood the first ever full length animated feature \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\". One of the greatest American films of all time, one of most renowed and the animated film to have the most releases from 1937-1993. An important masterpiece that is was once called \\"Walt Disney's Folly\\" but, who said that was very wrong, the film was immediate phemonenon and the highest grossing film of all time till it was knocked by \\"Gone with the Wind\\" I've been a fan of Disney for a long time and I know of all the animated films this is the one to see first. Snow White was only the begining, cartoons still stayed with Disney, but Snow White was Walt's turn to the movies. If you love Disney  as much as I do then see the most celebrated animated film of all time, the merriest and scariest of them all. See the one that started it all and still the fairest one of all. \\"SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS
B0007M22TI|5.0|Such beautiful music and very etherial. I purchased the CD of just the music and was disappointed that not all of the music from the show was indluded on it. The \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\" is one of the most lovely arrangements I have ever heard (except that it is not on the CD.)
0312319517|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read. The book was engrossing and goes on the innovative side. Everyone should buy this book for its highly creative content. Everyone should have atleast one copy of this book.

0812550706|4.0|<br /> Students I know that you all are looking for a book to read.  This book should be interesting but also fun.  This book should be Enders Game by Orson Scott Card. I am recommending this book because I enjoyed it too.  This book is a fiction book which means that is not real.  However, this book unlike other books it has more details than others.  Details in the way that you can understand it like if you are with the characters. This book also gets your attention because Card can speak to the audience very good.  Also, talk like the audience. <br /> This book might be enjoyed by someone that likes non-fiction and likes adventures or guessing what is going to happen next. My opinion of this book is that it is very good.  It is good because sometimes I feel as I am like Ender in the book was.  This book is like somebody's ideas about how the world is going to end or having a war with the aliens.  This book is great because it makes you think that Ender is not like the other kids but he is the chosen one.  In the beginning of the book I got to see how Ender was and his feeling were.  In addition, he changed over the book. <br /> Finally, if you choose this book, it will be great but if you do not, like this book, you may want to go to the library to go see what you like but you may ask your reading teacher for advice about your book and your interest.  <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I saw this movie 3 times in the theater this past summer and loved every second of it! Christopher Nolan did an awesome job at creating an actual story for the Dark Knight! It wasn't hookie or corny like the previous Batman movies have been, and I only hope that they make another with Christian Bale (who did an excellant job, as always!) It's a great movie, and if you're a big fan of Batman you will love this movie!!!!
B00009W0U4|3.0|This starts out at the end and works it way to the begining.  Along the way you see graphic violence, rape and murder.  Momento was much more restrained in comparison.  This is shot in a rough jerky motion that seems hard to watch at times reminisent of Blair Witch.  Spoilers ahead: Vincent Cassel(The Messenger) and Albert Dupontel are old friends who share a love of Monica Bellucci(Tears of the Sun).  They spar over Monica, Albert is the old lover while Vincent is her current lover.  All three go to a party thrown at a mutual firends apartment.  Monica leaves on her own and is told it's safer to cross a busy street by taking the underground passage.  She's in the middle of this when she sees a man strike and beat a woman he was walking with.  When she tries to turn around and go back the man attacks her, rapes her(taking a good ten minutes to do this) then leaves her after beating her once beautiful face into pulp.  This sends the two ex lovers into a search for the culprit who they brutally kill in the end.  Would I want to watch this movie over and over, probably not, but it's worth at least one viewing.
0380729407|4.0|Dear peers, <br /> <br />If a peer, wants to read this book Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury.  I think most peers like to read fiction books and this is a fiction book, so most people would like them.  This book is one of a kind, I say that because most of the times you do not read this types of novels.  This book takes place in a small town with a big storm on the way and no one in town cares except two kids.  This book is also about two friends, Jim and Will that have been friends since babies and do most things at the same time. These two boys find out a mystery that most people in town do not know about because it does not happen that often. This novel is interesting because thing happen that are not expected.  For example, an old man in a black suit told Jim and Will that Jims house was going to be hit by a lightning, so he gave them a lightning rod to help them. Then the old man in the black suit disappeared and Will went running to the house to help but Jim stayed behind like if he did not care that his mother was not in the house. Another example is when they went to the carnival when they are parents told them not to go because something weird is going on that only.  Wills dad knows but will not tell his kids.  In the carnival, they found out that the marry-go-round did work but went backwards.  Then they saw the people who worked in the carnival were changing figure, which was weird.  <br />Well if you choose to know more about the novel, you should read it and if you do, I hope you like it as much as I did.  <br />                                                                                  Sincerely, <br />                                                                                  Esmeralda Castillo <br />

Fenix cries as his pet elephant dies, gets a tattoo with a bowie knife from a quart jar of ink while biting on a stick,cavorts with a little girl mute tightrope walker, sees his mother's cult of blind women being driven away as their 'shrine' is demolished, and, finally, witnesses his own parents murder suicide over an affair with a tatooed woman.

0440237688|5.0|I first read this book back in 8th grade, many years ago. Now, I am not a huge book reader mind you. (Though I do keep up with the Harry Potter series.) But of all the books I have read, this has to be, by far, the best. I'll always remember when I was in school, reading this book, always wanting to skip ahead many chapters before class the next day. Ended up I read the whole book a week before we were suppose to finish it. I was enthralled buy it. Caught me be surprise that Jonas was seeing color for the first time. I was never told about that. Just the fact of a whole society where everything is controlled makes things interesting. Very well written in my opinion. With the ending, it isnt as bad as people think. The writer wants you to use your imagination and figure out what may have happened with Jonas. I think the ending is a good very happy. The Giver itself is a must read for any age.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|Set after the events of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", the nation is still in chaos with the dead rising from their graves and attacking the living. A group of surviving humans( Ken Foree, Gaylen Ross, Scott H. Reiniger and David Emge) hide out in a shopping mall for shelter armed with weapons, try to radio someone for help and battle out with the undead as they must try to survive as well as trying to fight out some biker thugs.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and an awesome sequel to George Romero's 1968 masterpiece \\"Night of the Living Dead\\"! what makes this movie work besides the classic gore and make-up by Tom Savini or the music by Dario Argento & Goblin is the interesting social satire in this movie that it presents. The acting can be amateruish but there is plenty of action and violent scenes in this movie that also helps out in making this one of the greatest horror movies ever made, often imitated ( mostly by Europeans) but never eqauled.<br /><br />This 4-Disc Ultimate Edition DVD set is just as awesome as the movie itself with excellent Divamax digital picture & sound remastering, audio commentaries, trailers, TV Spots, radio spots, Poster and Still galleries, easter eggs, interviews, featurettes, documentarys, and three versions: Original theatrical version, Director's Cut and Euro cut.<br /><br />This is a must have for every horror aficonado's DVD library, highly recommended if you want to see the ultimate in zombie horror.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Day of the Dead\\", \\"Evil Dead\\", \\"Zombie\\" ( a.k.a.

B0002IU988|5.0|I have to say I just recently found this CD. I bought 4 copies from FYE to give to my friends for different occasions. Man I cannot TELL YOU how much they LOVED the CD. First time I heard it, it was like, Angles singing. It is by far the most incredible band out there(my opinion).  <br /> <br />I'm a major fan of Creed, but when I heard this CD, I was led to beleive that Scott Stapp(Singer of Creed) was lower in music quality then Alter Bridge.  <br /> <br />I was sad at first to hear Creed broke up but when I listened to the newly formed band, I was just so happy.  <br /> <br />I never found music so enjoyable and meaningful. To tell you the truth, the 30 second sound clips is what got me into it...
B00005IC2H|5.0|Although i don't understand at all what is being said i find the language eclectic and delicious. It sounds wonderful and suits the relaxed mood of their music perfectly! <br /> <br />Often i've put this album on and my friends ask \\"who is this?\\" with genuine interest in who is producing such a great sound. \\"Sigur Ros\\" I say. \\"What?\\" \\"I said See-ger-ros\\" <br /> <br />I'm not sure how to say their name. I don't know what they're saying. But when I put this music on it takes me away. <br /> <br />Listen to this one lying down and sink into the floor.
0156027321|2.0|<br /> Life of pi was a very confusing book written by Yann Martel.  I was confused because it had a lot of dialog.  I was not shouer if pi was talking or someone else was.  I do not think they explain it fully to understand it at lest not for me.  Life of pi is a very challenging book to read you have to be an erudite person to read that book one and understand it.  This book was challenging for me because I was not shouer of which character was taking they did not tell you who is taking.  He writes it like if it was a real conversation.  He also wrote with a assent so that was head for me to understand.  If you like books they have a challenge and if you like adventure and has a lot of communication in the book then this is the book for you. I also think the book was kind of boring because for one I did not understand it and it kept getting off topic.  He will talk about one thing and in the next he would toke about anther thing. That is one of the reasons did not like this book.  This book was mostly about religion and animals.  He will explain why he does in the book.  so if you are a interested in religion and animals then this is the book for you.  <br />
B000000OUJ|5.0|Please note that RZA is the producer, and GZA is the rapper. <br /> <br />First, analyze the name, CD, album cover and everything.  For the name, GZA, sounds interesting right? GZA/Genius let's you know that this guy has confidence, tht he is good, that he knows what he is doing. Now look at the album cover, you can tell there will be mind blowing metaphors.  You will be able to picture everything, now you should be wanting to look into the album.  Then take the chance and buy it... <br /> <br />You open up a long intro, explaining the theme of the album, and the first track is Liquid Swords... An okay track, but RZA lays down an okoay beat, sort of simple loop, but you can live through it. <br /> <br />To  the second track, Duel Of The Iron Mic.  One of my most favorites.  This has a Chinese Martial Arts culture sound loop to it.  But never the less, it's good.  Always point out the metaphors. <br /> <br />3rd, Living In The World Today, my 2nd favorite.  A thumping beat backs up  GZA's overwhelming comparisons and lyrics.  This is a must listen. <br /> <br />Skipping to Cold World, RZA packs a power punch with the beat, and a nice melody with a man singing over it.  You can never expect any mediocre words from GZA.  So I will not mention how great his lyrics are. <br /> <br />After a few tracks, we go to the single of the album \\"Shadowboxin'\\" featuring Method Man.  This is a another gem from GZA. <br /> <br />Just to go over a few tracks that I thought were good. <br /> <br />This is a classic, a must buy.  I hate how people say you're not a hip hop fan if you don't have it.  It's persuasion, but I don't agree with that. <br /> <br />Get this if you love hip hop, and if you don't have it, I suggest you get it or you're missing out.  That's a better way to say it. <br /> <br />Check my other reviews

B00000294R|5.0|Yes, look into it, don't be shy.  Big L is offering to take you on a trip to Harlem, tell you about his lifestyle, and everything.  This is truely a masterpiece. <br /> <br />To open up this horror-rap genre  classic album, he gives you Put it On.  Kid Capri does vocals on the chorus, after every punchline from Big L.  L also puts humour into this song.  Never skip this. <br /> <br />Then I'd like to go to 8 is Enuff, the first collaboration from this album.  Future star Cam'ron put down a nice verse over the bass bamming beat.  8 rappers make nonsense of the saying \\"1 Is Enough\\" as they make their statement on this song.  This is another good listen for your innocent little ears. <br /> <br />Danger Zone, my favorite song from Big L, and also the one that introduced me to him.  I really love this song.  Even though he does say some satanic things, you must ignore them and listen to the real things.  I love the way Big L connects every word with every word, it's amazing. <br /> <br />Now we go to All Black, a song I had stuck in my head all day today! You never really get the beat stuck in your head, just the lyrics.  The colorful beat, but creepy beat matches L's style.  You must hear this.  It's beyond... I don't know.  It's good though. <br /> <br />Another standout, and the last one I will name is Lifestyles of the poor and Dangerous.  Looking at the title of the song will tell you Big L is gonna wake you up with these vocalized nightmares.  The beat is just... well I won't say, just listen to it. <br /> <br />I hope this is enough to persuade you to buy this... well go out now.  I see it in many stores, if not here then order it at ours truely, Amazon!

B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney has never been a respected singer like Mariah Carey or Whitney.  She has never been able to create music on the same level as her rival Christina Aguillera who has an impressive vocal range.  In fact if you are looking for a true pop artist you may find that artists like Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson have more to offer their fans when it comes to singing and creating albums.  But Britney seems to end up being the most popular young artist because of her image.   <br /> <br />In light of this Britney manages to release an album that is of a significantly higher standard.  The debut album consisted of one good hit-the title track and too much filler that somehow managed to make an appearance on the charts.  Her voice was nothing special, however she had a shyness and lightness that made her stand apart from other stars.  The sophomore album was too commercial and over-produced.  She was trying too hard to create a different sound that made her more grown up and sexy, but it was not an album that displayed her talent.  This album surprised me because Britney can change from the bubble-gum starlet who was famous for her simple lyrics and catchy production work, to a more sophisticated and respected singer.  Don't expect any heartfelt ballads as I am afraid Britney has not improved in terms of her voice, but she has stopped sounding so annoying.  She used to emphasise her accent too much when you are actually meant to lose your accent when you sing.  I'm a Slave for you is a hot track despite all the negativity surrounding the song.  Produced by N.E.R.D, the song has a fresh and darker beat that is associated with R'n'B singers.  The ballad im not a girl is not strong enough to stand on its own and the cover version of I love Rock and Roll is unacceptably poor.  However, there are some catchy pop tunes on the album and thats what makes it her best album

Their drummer is Chuck Comeau and the lead guitarist is Jeff Stinco.   <br /> \\"Still Not Getting Any\\" starts out with a bang.  \\"Shut Up!\\" is the first track on the CD and it is an up tempo song.  It is followed with another up beat song that is good as well called \\"Welcome To My Life.\\"  \\"Perfect World\\" is next in line, but is to slow.  Following is the song \\"Thank You,\\" in which they pick up the beat again.  They drop down again with the song \\"Me Against The World,\\" which is just to slow, like \\"Perfect World.\\"  \\"Crazy\\" is not as fast paced, but is still good.  They come back with another faster song called \\"Jump.\\"  It has a great beat and good lyrics.  \\"Every Time\\" is another slow song and the last of that type on the CD, thank goodness. The next two songs \\"Promise\\" and \\"One\\" are ok and that is about all I can say for those.  The last song on the album is the best song on the CD.  Though it is slow it is different than Simple Plan's other slow songs.  The track \\"Untitled\\" has great lyrics.  The song asks,  \\"how could this happen to me,\\" after he made a mistake, because he doesn't know how, whatever happened, could happen to him.   <br /> This is a good CD, but has a few bad slow songs, which hurt them on this album.  Without the slow songs it would have been an excellent CD.  I did like it, for the most part, so I'm still going to give it a rating of four stars.   <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|There seems to be a general laziness surrounding both the album and the band. Most of these third grade written songs could have been recorded so much better, performed better and really turned into something. Direction in the studio either has to come from U2 (preferably) or their useless producers army. <br /> <br />Does Bono have layringitis? is his voice shot because of the rehearsals for this foul or shot from the long-time out of practicing? I'm finding differing information coming my way as to why Bono's voice isn't quite fully ship-shape, but no matter. Sadly, it's clear he loves the \\"effect\\" his rotten hoarse voice give these recordings? It's not uncommon for singers to have vocal complaints that lend them a different sound that they run with for awhile. This is nothing new. He has been sounding like s*** since his last 2 albums. <br /> <br />The whole band is completely anemic, guitar work is unimpressive, the music is lightweight, so lightweight and nonsensical, a child may as well have written them. The lyrics pretend to be \\"personal\\", but that's just bulls***... is Vertigo a personal song?. Come on!. The lyrics on that 3 minute iPod jingle are nothing at all, just mere words that mean nothing. At the stupidity of it all. <br /> <br />The whole B-side is just excrement, as the B-side of ATYCLB. By the way, HTDAAB is the same kind of material, seemingly constructed and consisting of very little. <br /> <br />HTDAAB will grab you only if you allow it to. This albums is too light, too un-weighty and too middle of the road to be taken as something good. <br /> <br />This is a fairly unremarkable album, catastrophically bad, from a fairly unremarkable U2 2000, all told.  <br /> <br />It's clear why this album was out of the Billboard top 200 after 39 weeks, despite one of the most disgusting hype campaigns in the music history, flattered by the mass media. <br /> <br />What has happened to this band? they've become KISS. Buy their 80s and 90s albums instead.<br /> <br />
B0007ZEBIK|4.0|Simply Punk  <br />Reviewer: Cody Shoman 11 A.M. <br /> The punk-rock group from Montreal, did a pretty good job on their album \\"Still Not Getting Any.\\"  Simple Plan is a Canadian punk band who has just started to make it big in the last few years.  Their main vocalist is Pierre Bouvier.  David Desrosiers and Sebastien LeFebvre are both back-up vocalists.  They both have other attributes as well.

B00005M989|4.0|No hidden treasures, no special album tracks, just the hits.  A good choice if that's all you want. If you think you want to explore Prince, and you don't know where to start, you can start here (the songs are chronological) so you can figure out what era is your favorite.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this new album by Eric Clapton.<br /><br /> He recently got married again, and he now has 3 young children.  Most of the tracks on this album are about how much he loves being a new father and husband.  The song Run Home To Me is about how much he enjoys spending time with his family and watching his kids play.  He sings about his lack of sleep and how much he relies on his wife on the track So Tired.  These lyrics are so true, because as every new parent knows babies require constant attention.  Say What You Will is another highlight on this CD.  This is a sweet song is about the friendship, support, and love Eric receives from his wife.  I also enjoyed Eric's cover of the George Harrison's song Love Comes To Everyone.  I love the instruments playing on this track especially the keyboard and dobro steel guitar.  Love Don't Love Nobody is a cover of an old Spinners song about how loving someone is never simple and easy.  This is a fairly long song at over 7 minutes, but I loved it, because Eric's vocals are so moving and honest.<br /><br />I'm Going Left is a song that really got me moving.  I love the energy in Eric's spirited  vocals.  It sounds like all the musicians are performing on this track.  Revolution is a track with a nice regaae sound with the horns playing on it.  Lost and Found is a song that features Clapton jamming on his guitar.  This song has a hard blues edge that is very enjoyable to listen to.  This album does not say which musicians perform on what track, but I could detect Steve Winwood on the keyboard and John Mayer playing guitar in the background.  I loved listening to Back Home.  It is great to see Eric Clapton back on the music scene.
B00005JKL8|4.0|I really liked this movie. A lot of people didn't, I'm sure, but as an action movie, it does very well. The flight sequence was very well done, especially when they start firing the missiles. The action throughout the whole movie was great, despite probably being unrealistic, but I don't really care about that sort of thing in most movies, because..they're movies. Watch this for the action and the pretty well-done cinematography. Not the plot or character development. There's plenty of action, shooting, and violence for action buffs out there. Go see this, it's cheap enough you can find it for cheap on DVD on ebay or other places.
B00005JNSK|4.0|If you enjoyed Roald Dahl's book, you'll like this movie. It's a bit different, but it does try - witness the very crooked, very drafty house that Charlie and his family live in. The sets are lavish and detailed, and Johnny Depp does a great job as usual, playing the bizarre Wonka.  One thing sort of creeped me out - only one Oompa Loompa (Roy Deep) computer-generated into many - all with the same face of course. Was this a cheesy money-saving trick or a deliberate quirk? Danny Elfman's songs were great and I will see this film again.
0312935080|4.0|As with most of Michael Connelly's books the story holds your attention all the way to the last page. It was a good read.
B00005JODA|2.0|I was really prepared to like and be impressed with this film, but I just can't lower my standards. Tessa, a 24 year old free spirit who has already written her will, marries a stodgy British government person (what was it he did?), they travel to Africa, and she meets a black doctor named Blum. There's some weird stuff going on with this pharmaceutical company and its investors (if medicine is approved there will be 1500 jobs in France).  They are trying out this TB medicine on AIDS patients to see what the side effects are, instead of trying it out on TB patients. Side effect: kills AIDS patients.  This doesn't matter to the pharm company because these people's lives are expendable to them, but it's a big secret that no one must figure out.  Tessa and Blum figure it out and she writes a report, and very stupidly makes sure it gets to exactly the wrong people.  Blum, who previously shushed her, wants to go to the media, but she says no, do it her way. Why? So her husband will not have to be embarassed by her.  She and Blum are murdered, and her husband spends the movie (many flashbacks) trying to find out who precisely is responsible.  Bigwigs sit at a large table to discuss the problem (how to hide it from him), then various ones come forward to spill the beans to hubby to help him figure it out.<br /><br />Basically, this movie makes no sense. Re-write it to where the characters have brains and plausible motives, then maybe it wouldn't be a complete failure.
B000005J48|4.0|I bought this record following a live performance by Gidon Kremer et al. at the Verbier Festival. The mixture of classical music with a dose of jazz on a Latin base produces an interesting result that is quite surprising at first. However, the more one hears, the more the result grows on the listener, just as at the live show where the audience, somewhat stunned at the outset, gave a standing ovation at the end. <br /> <br />Overall, the mlange is pleasant, chill listening to be appreciated by fans of any of the three styles of music.
B00005JNTX|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, as far as comic book movies go, this was perfect. The script was the comic book; it followed it exactly. This is the only way Frank Miller would have had it. He's been approached for this movies several times in the past but rejected doing it simply because he wanted it to follow exactly to the comic. He didn't sell out like a lot of other comic book movies do. It's not Hollywood-ized at all. Perhaps this is why so many people just don't get this movie. If you view this movie as if you are viewing a comic book, then you get it. It is a film like no other.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez and Miller (who shared directing duties) did an amazing job with the filming. I love the way they used live actors with CGI backgrounds. The whole film (like the comic book) is black and white with touches of red and yellow. For example, in the beginning scene of the movie everything is black and white except for a woman's vibrant red dress and lips. This paints a very somber mood for the movie.<br /><br />I don't think they could have picked better actors for the roles of the characters. Everyone did a superb job. Elijah Wood was just down right creepy as a maniac who eats women and hangs their severed heads on his wall. Mickey Rourke just seemed at home on screen. He was perfect for the role and it just feels like he was the heart of Sin City; like this is where he lives. Bruce Willis is finally starting to play his age. In this he played an old cop with a heart condition. He's on the verge of retirement when he gets the biggest case of his carreer involving the senator's son. Then there is Clive Owen who plays the hard-guy who helps the prostitutes with a crocked cope played by Benicio Del Toro. Everyone just seemed to have fun playing their role and it was entertaining to watch them.<br /><br />From start to finish, this movie thrusts into momentum. There is no down time or lulls. Be forewarned though, the title is a dead giveaway for what you're in store for. There is nudity, prostitution, violence galore, cussing, killing, raping, kidnapping, eating, severing, bashing, dimembering...you name it...Sin City has it.nudity, prostitution, violence galore, cussing, killing, raping, kidnapping, eating, severing, bashing, dimembering...you name it...Sin City has it.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Hey, I'm from Dallas, TX. & have been a huge Clapton fan ever since I was 5 years old in 1990. I think that this is an absolutely wonderful album. Highlights for me include So Tired, Love Don't Love Nobody, Love Comes To Everyone, One Day, Lost & Found, & Back Home. All the songs are great, & I'm really glad that Clapton's singing happy songs, because he's in that part of his life right now, & I really admire him for wanting to be with his family, he deserves that. But, I'll be glad when he goes on tour for this album, because I want to hear these songs live. Anyway, I'll close now by saying that I love Clapton's music, & hopefully I'll meet him someday.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used are not just another screamo band. Their songs are about real life experiences, that's why they're so good. People can identify with them. I love this album, because for one thing, it makes me feel alive. And, I never get bored listening to it. I just can't say enough about these guys.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I somehow stumbled upon this CD a week ago and I can't stop listening to it. I can't believe it took me this long to realize how great the Mars Volta is. This is one of my favorite CDs now. I love how it just goes from calm one second to full blown music intensity, this guy has the best voice i ever heard and I can't get enough of it. My favorite song is Eriatarka. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who just enjoys great music.  I cant wait to buy Frances the Mute, I hope it is as great or even better than De-loused.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Johnny Depp continues to amaze theater buffs with his stunningly captivating portrayal of a lonely, dejected candyman-child.  Love the acting, directing, visual effects, writing, producing,cast, and especially the fact that the entire family will be able to enjoy what is destined to be another masterpiece and timeless feature film for children of all ages.  Thumbs way up for this Oscar-calliber performer, one of the best of our time.  Every grown-up should visit childhood again and see Charlie & The Chocolate Factory if for no other reason than to say hello to the Oompah-Loompah's!
B0000029DD|4.0|OK, it's clear you either love or loathe this. I'm not skilled enough to go into the intricacies of chord selection (there's plenty on here who seem to be though!). All I can say is that Hallelujah and Lilac Wine are just about the most glorious tracks I've heard on disc. Seems over the top? Perhaps. A worthy addition to any collection.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|Being a former Metallica fan (thank you very much Load and Reload)I got St. Anger, and found that at least they tried to recapture some of their old fire.  So being daring i watched this movie and gained some respect for some (and I stress some)and yet lost even more for others. So I offer my win and loss respect column for this movie.  First the winners from this movie.    1. James Hetfield - Kudos goes to James for getting his life together, going to rehab, and trying to keep his band together when it would have been easier to walk away.    2.  Kirk Hammett - Kirk comes off as the peace maker and is really the heart and soul of the band. plus standing off with Lars Ulrich when Lars tried to stop all guitar solos on the album.    3.  Jason Newstead - Kudos to Jason for having the courage to leave one of the biggest rock bands in the world, and to state how weak Metallica was for having a therapist come in and help them make a album together instead of being a true band and working together, and remain true to metal and on a personal note Echobrain rules!    and now for the absolute losers. . . .    1.  Lars Ulrich - Just when you thought this punk couldn't be any more of a [...], he goes and really outdoes himself.  Case In point, when Lars and Bob Rock go to the Echobrain concert, Ulrich seemed like he was enjoying the thought of Jason Newstead falling flat on his face, but when Echobrain rocked the house, It left poor Lars depressed and upset about his band.  How [...]!    2.  Dave Mustane - Yes Dave makes an appearance in one of the therapy sessions.  First of all after Metallica defected to alternative rock (If you wanna even call it that) The only thing us Metal heads had to hang our hats on is that we still had Megadeth, then here is Dave Mustane leader of Megadeth face to face with Lars Ulrich, thinking he was going to bury Lars, Mustane goes snotting and crying about how he thinks his whole career after Metallica has been a \\"backfire\\" and crying how he wished it was 1982 again and he had another shot with Metallica.  Thanks alot Dave for giving any legitamacy to what Metallica has done to metal.  Every metal fan now needs to disown Megadeth as well now.  Thanks alot for burying metal in a trail of tears and [...].    Summation: This is a interesting video to have it takes you deep inside a rock band and it is very interesting to see a album taking shape, but if you dont want to get upset at some of your heroes looking like wussies dont watch this train wreck.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|Once I had listened to Transatlantacism about 10 times through i decided that it was one of the best albums of all time, but I soon found myself skipping such favorites as \\"title and registration\\" and \\"the new year\\" in favor of \\"transatlanticsm\\" and \\"a lack of color\\", \\"Plans\\" requires no skipping as it really has no incredibly upbeat poppy songs that are catchy at first and fade, all of the songs are beautiful and deeply poetic(especially \\"summer skin\\" and \\"I will follow you into the dark\\"), dont get me wrong, i love \\"Transatlanticism\\", but \\"Plans\\" just may beat it out. Another winner from the great evergreen state.
B000053V7Q|4.0|I wished he sang the songs better, The Aloha from Hawaii is EXCELLENT!
0765348780|2.0|A bit of a disappointment.  Through the first 100 pages or so, I really held high hopes for this series, but my patience fizzled fast.  The author spends a lot of time weaving images which have very little story, characters that are confusing and dull, and the story is so winding, and rambling that I lost interest long ago about who these people are and what they're doing. <br /> <br />Erikson seems to be someone who likes to use intellectual, supposedly 'smart' ideas, but lacks the ability of translating those ideas into a form that your average reader can understand.   <br /> <br />George R. R. Martin also writes huge tomes, but whereas he is a true 'storyteller', Erikson falls flat.   <br /> <br />I have bought the next two in the series already so will give the second book in the series a chance.  If the ideas aren't presented in a muddle, like the first book, it will be worth reading but if it's still the same writing style, I will probably give up after the first few pages and hand them on to Goodwill.
B0002ZMJ5M|3.0|Both Ian Anderson and Martin Barre were busy with solo albums at the time and this whole album comes off like an afterthought.  While all five members of the current version of Tull play on the album they don't all play on any of the tracks together.  A few of the songs are okay, \\"Last Man At The Party\\" is the most humorous, \\"First Snow On Brooklyn\\" is sloppily sentimental, and \\"Pavane\\" is the best instumental.  For those who have to have the entire  Tull catalog here it is.  Don't pay full price though, buy it used and save your money.
B000031WI8|4.0|Wham!was one of the most energetic groups of the 80s i used to be waiting for their videos to show up on Mtv because their videos were fun about this compilation barring a few songs like If You Were There mostof their hits are there and a worth buy for any fan of 80s music
B0002DB50E|5.0|Videodrome is not only one of the top three horror/sci-fi movies made in the last 25 years it also has the distinguishing trait of having been given one of the best royal treatments from Criterion.  If you need basic plot and such look elsewhere.  This review is more about why this is one of the greatest films of all time. <br />First, the film:  A must-have for any film collector, not just a horror or sci-fi buff.  James Woods plays a Cable-TV station owner who broadcasts soft-porn and adult entertainment.  His favorite technician shows him a pirated TV show called Videodrome in which people are tortured and killed. Woods pursues this show, watching more and more of it until his investigations lead him to two sources:  The Videodrome show producers itself and the show's arch-enemy, The Cathode Ray Mission.  Woods discovers that the show transmits a signal that creates a tumor in the brain that leads to S+M hallucinations. Woods begins to hallucinate incredible sexual/violent nightmares ( the fleshy TV set)and finds himself as a pawn between the two entities.  Videodrome plans on using Woods' station to transmit the violent Videodrome show in order to kill the audience of porn. Videodrome owner Barry Convex \\"programs\\" Woods to kill his partners at the station and the Cathode Ray Mission Leader, Bianca O'Blivion. Bianca \\"counter programs\\" Woods into killing the Videodrome people.  Bianca declares that Woods has \\"evolved\\" (Darwinism on its ear) into The New Flesh, an allegory of an information-age human with a body that mutates via hallucination.  In the end, Woods, alone and his head filled with tumors, is prompted by his now dead girlfriend (Deborah Harry in the flesh TV set) to \\"evolve\\" into the next stage by shooting himself. Woods kills himself exactly as the fleshy TV set instructs him to do, declaring:  \\"Long live the New Flesh.\\" <br /> <br />Cronenberg gathered many parts of a script and ideas together to create a near avant-garde film that uses TV and fanatical programmers as villains.  This movie sets the thriller basis for which The Matrix and The Ring would so heavily borrow from.  Cronenberg's approach is different from his previous film SCANNERS in that the protaganist's perspective (a tremendous James Woods) becomes the actual subject of the movie.  Since Videodrome has probably been seen my almost everone who reads this I need not bother to summarize the plot any further.  Suffice to say that what starts out as an already interesting and challenging portrait of a soft-porn Cable-TV station owner looking for the next big thing in the adult entertainment world evolves into a nightmare that relentlessly never eases until the very last frame.  This psychotic world and body (called The New Flesh)that Woods now finds himself becomes an allegory for our dependance and adhearance to Media and TV in particular.  The concepts of \\"downloading\\" and \\"programming people\\" was, back in 1981, revolutionary.  Kafka meets Tom Edison.   The villains are evangelical and are either using the cancer-tumor inducing \\"videodrome\\" signal to kill sinners (Barry Convex looks like Jimmy Baker) or, in a twist of Darwin, the Cathode Ray Mission using the signal to \\"evolve\\" people to the next state of our existance:  a personified information society of hallucinating, mutated people.  This film was ahead of its time by decades and is still a significant movie using TV/Media as the vehicle for great evil, as prompted by an already receptive audience.  Cronenberg suggests that we have created a TV Pornographic Frankenstien that is out of control. <br /> <br />The DVD:  Two discs, both essential.  The commentary from Cronengerg and James Woods is particulary interesting.  Deborah Harry comments as well. The extras on Disc two feature excellent interviews with the special effects team, and a TV interview show from Canadian TV with John Carpenter, John Landis, and Cronenberg.  The making of film is good and the actual torture and porn videos shot especially for the film are just bizzare to see, and they are provied with commentary.  The DVD case is made to look like a betamax cassette that reads:  Long Live the New Flesh.  I love this movie, I always have.  Yes, it has dated a little bit, but its one of those few movies that gets better with age.  In fact, the dating of the effects adds significance to the visionary horror concept itself, light years ahead of its time.  This is Cronenberg's masterpiece and everyone associated with it can consider themselves lucky.  Make yourself among these lucky and get this DVD set.
0399152717|1.0|It is sad to see that Cussler is becoming jaded with his own books. Kurt Austin (Dirk Pitt clone) is a ho-hum character, and the whole NUMA expeience has run out of steam. There are now three or four series that Cussler, with co-authors are pounding out at so rapid a pace I wonder if they actually care anymore about creating great adventures, or is making money the motive. The recent books all read like comic books, stilted, no characterization, no depth, no interesting plot twists and a whole lot of description that amounts to nothing but formulaic writing at its worst. Cussler has entered the world of the famous writer living off past success - like Tom Clancy. Novel factories is what you get. I am mad at myself that I gave him yet another chance and found myself reading the same book as his last Austin/Pitt efforts.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|I'm a big, big Clapton fan & I have to say this is a totally forgetable album of muzak. Eric where's the edge?
B0000020C4|5.0|I love Les Miserables with all of my heart and this CD is one of my very favorite versions of the musical. I have the whole symphonic version and soon, I'll have this once again. The reason why I love this so much because it has Colm Wilkinson and Lea Salonga singing who happens to be my two favorite characters (Jean Valjean and Eponine) playing in the musical. I used to own this CD but my mother loved it so much, I ended up giving mine to her. The CD itself was pretty brand new at the time since I only used it 2 or 3 times. lol! It was worth the smile on her face. But now, I have to get myself another one!   One thing that I just LOVED that can only happen on this CD, was the very last finale where Valjeans from around the world sing \\"Do you hear the people sing?\\" in their own native languages. Simply AWESOME! :)
B000002UAU|5.0|This album is a classic and doesn't need my input, but I felt the need to respond to \\"A Fair and Balanced Rater\\".  Assuming your review isn't a joke, you might want to check your calendar: Sgt. Pepper's Loney Hearts Club Band was released June 1, 1967 while Dark Side of The Moon was released March 2, 1973.  I'd be interested in hearing your explanation as to how The Beatles ripped off Pink Floyd.
B0000026J1|3.0|the swedes do it again with the 3rd release out of this world.the strong point of this cd is the guitar player change to new man kee marcello.marcello to me is far better on guitar than the other player on final countdown cd.joey tempest as always delivers the voice great as always & also done all of the writing.the song open your heart is redone to a different set of words & rythm, the result to me is a far better mix than the first.this is a great cd to play on a rainy day & dream about sweden.it didnt turn out to be a hugh success for the band but it wasnt their last.i been a europe fan from the first cd but they didnt catch america till mtv gave them a chance for winning a music contest the result final countdown was born....the swedes have always made good music from abba to yngwie malmsteen....europe is another.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold's new CD City of Evil i think is some of their best work. ive been a fan of A7x since Waking the Fallen and still think city of evil is a little better. I think avenged sevenfold's move to no screaming was wise if they want to last. They didnt want to become another generic band and a7x didnt want to be labeled Metalcore. They want to sound like bands that made rock like ac/dc and guns n roses. I think all these emo/metalcore/screamo bands are going to be forgotten, but i think avenged sevenfold will be remembered for doing original music.  Yes, it is controversal if M. Shadows got throat surgury or not, but i dont really care for the screaming that much, even though it sounded alright. the truth is shadows can still scream, but none of the bands he grew up with screamed. Im just soo sick of people brutally putting down this CD. They say that thier fans, thier not true fans. probably half of them havent listened to the whole cd. I thinks Matt's voice is fine, the guitars just awesome, so are the drums and bass.  I think its great that Avenged Sevenfold are getting some attention with Bat Country(a song dedicated to one of my favorite movies fear and loathing in las vegas), and i think its great they are losing all those poser fans and gaining fans of their new music. They were unbelivable at warped tour, there were tons of fans thier.    Im not going to say all of my favorites on the cd, but i will say some songs are better than others.   I hope a7x will stay around for a while, but you never know. there are stories of heavy drug usage, achohol and other stuff. If they dont watch out they could lose members like we have seen with many other bands.   Overall the CD is 5/5 some great rock today out of a time where good rock is fading.

B0007Y08I8|4.0|Team America is terribly offensive if you are: conservative, liberal, Middle Eastern, American, Hispanic, Oriental, Male, Female, Homosexual, Heterosexual, Peaceful, Violent, etc., etc. It doesn't favor any side.  It makes fun of everyone and if you watch it with an open mind you can see that everyone deserves some making fun of.  There are stuff that I believe that were lampooned in this movie, but I still loved it.  I laughed out loud many times the first time I saw it.  It's puppets and if you're really offended by puppets then maybe you can see the unreality that we place on many of the things in the news and in our lives.  Look at it from an outside perspective.  Many of the things in our lives that can be so important turn out to be puppets, false feelings or motivations that eventually dissipate.  Watch the movie with an open mind.  It makes fun of mindless action movies and it will make you laugh very hard.  I think it's great.

0060574216|4.0|This book is certainly of interest even if you are not a novice to the world of men-to-women communication. I believe the author's approach is realistic enough to make the book worth reading. The confusion arises when having applied the theory to practice you realize e.g. that sometimes Marcians are inclined to talk their problems out just like Venusians do and the last thing they expect in return is getting advice on the solution.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Being a huge fan of this group, I really enjoyed this concert, the sound is amazing, the song selection is far better and extense than in Hell Freezes Over. The new arrangement for introducing Hotel California is beautiful. I really hope this guys keep touring forever. They are like wine, better with the years. If you like Eagles, you can't miss this double DVD. There's only one thing that keeps me thinking, while editing, they never show the song \\"Best of my Love\\" which was a huge smash. In Hell Freezes Over it's in the ending credits, but the song it's not in the concert, neither in this excelent compilation. That nice song is still missing and I hope it will be in the next DVD. Eagles keep touring forever!!.
0812550706|3.0|<br /> Ender's Game, written by Orison Scott Card is very interesting book.  It is captivating to read.  The way Orison Scott Card wrote it was more startling than other books.  If you go from reading a primary source to reading a fiction story, it is somewhat weird to understand.  Before you read this book, read another fiction story.  Then that way you can have your imagination at a higher level.  You then can understand it, better.  If you go from reading a true story you are imagining things at a level were it is things the actually happen.  When you imagination is at higher level, you can imagine the things that are happening in the story.  You then understand the book a lot better <br /> <br /> There is a plot to the story.  It is not a book that you read for no purpose.  There is action throughout the book because it deals battles in space.  Throughout the book, the are battles between the teams.  The teams go against each other.  The battles are just simulation battles.  <br /> <br /> There are a couple of intriguing parts in the book.  You just have to understand it better.  The book is somewhat long, but not too long. <br /> <br /> I think that anyone who likes to read or just likes sci-fi books will like this novel.  If not, do not read it because it will bore you to death. <br /> <br />

B0007CNXUK|4.0|Although I fell asleep during the earlier parts of the movie, by the end I was choked up enough to make my girlfriend want to propose to me on the spot. Really guys, this movie is a great chance to show your ladies how emotional and vunerable you really are deep down inside, or at least to pretend so you can get some action. Finding Neverland is just full of  heartwarming moments, cute little kids with British accents, and a love story that works without any sex at all (and probably because of it). Honestly, this movie is so nice, it makes Peter Pan, the play it's based around, look like Die Hard.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie is definetly violent, but I think in a sense you need that to really know what happened during world war II, Adrien Brody I believe in his finest performence yet. The Pianist is a great film and it is even cooler to know that it was directed by someone who is a survivor of world war II who lost almost his whole family. This film was also written from a book, the storyline is almost the same as in the book, it is based on a true story about a polish pianist from the 1940's. Adrien Brody played the part so well throughout the whole movie, The struggles he went through just in order to survive even though his entire family might be dead, he stayed alive because of the love of music. This film will open your eyes and make you see that whatever is going on in your life, it isn't so bad, if he could survive getting shot at everyday and never staying in more than one place for a week than anybody can survive anything. The Pianist portrays WWII really well, the only movie in my opinion that comes close to this film is shindlers list, also a great film. If you have heard good things about this film than it is because it is a spectacular film, an instant classic in my library. But The Pianist, you wont regret it.
1400031087|5.0|This story was amazing!  James has a very unique and captaviting story telling technique.<br /><br />The way that<br /><br />he writes,<br /><br />it makes you<br /><br />want to keep<br /><br />reading onto<br /><br />the next line<br /><br />to see what<br /><br />he's going to say next.<br /><br />The language in here can be strong, but it allows you to understand and feel what it is that he's going through.  There are many bonds he makes during his stay at the clinic and while he is making these bonds, you can see him changing and getting stronger.<br /><br />The last page of the book, there is an account that lists what happened to all the other residents, and to me, that was the most shocking part and it even brought a tear to my eyes.<br /><br />I am going to buy James Frey's newer book, \\"my friend leonard\\" soon and I can guarantee that will be another great read!
B000007NYS|5.0|I just plucked this CD out of my \\"all time favorites\\" collection to hear \\"Crescent City\\" - the one song that floated in my head for days since hurricane Katrina tore the heart out of New Orleans.  The longing to go there, missing the old days when \\"we used to...\\"  are EXACTLY how I felt when this tragedy occurred.  I always knew Lucinda had an incredible talent for writing - from the time I first saw her performing on Austin City Limits in the early 90s.  To me, this CD is the epitome of good music because it is just enough to connect for most people - not over the top in poetry, but with far more depth than most country music, and no synthetic sound.  I think of this CD as \\"raw' because there is nothing flashy about it.  Lyrics are clearly from the heart, and instruments are played in a traditional and purely unadulterated form.  You hear the fiddle, the drums, the bass, guitars, all orchestrated in a way that only the fiercly independent Lucinda could have done.  It is perfect.  This is what I'd like to see performed live again in an intimate venue.  It is what I play on the porch on a hot summer afternoon.  It will forever remain an \\"all time favorite\\" for me.

0316172324|1.0|The book begins with an enticing account of the power of intuition, i.e., of the \\"adaptive unconscious\\" to make decisions more reliably than linear, left-brain evaluation of data.  The reader expects a guide to accessing this subliminal power.  Instead, the author gives a series of overlong, padded accounts of cases where instant perception trumped careful data gathering, balanced by accounts of cases in which careful data gathering trumped instant perception.   <br /> <br />The reader tries in vain to see a solid connection between the episodes recounted - from \\"thin-slicing\\" of videotaped encounters between married couples to the benefits of a trained sensory apparatus in evaluating food and wine to the dangers to innocent bystanders when police officers jump to stereotyped conclusions about people and places.   In the end, the reader is no wiser about the means of mining the \\"adaptive unconscious\\" than before picking up the book.  The book can be summarized in two sentences:  \\"Sometimes the right brain is more reliable than the left brain.  Sometimes the left brain is more reliable than the right brain.\\"   <br /> <br />The author has provided some endnotes with useful references for the reader wanting to  learn something substantive about the subjects hinted at in \\"Blink.\\" <br />

B0006957SA|5.0|One could look at the cover of this album and dismiss the Pogues as yet another super cute boy band that the chicks would go nuts nuts for. Unlike N'Sync and New Kids, these guys can play their instruments really good. They don't dance near as well as the backsteet boys, but I don't think they care. They would literally beat the poop out of the other boy bands. Their music reminds me of my trips to Ireland for Ultimate Fighting tournaments. I would spend the day at the pub, kicking back Harp after Harp until my manager Seamus McCoy would tell me I needed to get to the arena for my match. I would walk in and Shaymus would point where I needed to go and I would walk up and when the referee said go I unleashed a barrage of shiverwoks, Knockfacers and Blittycrushes. I usually had a submission in under 20 seconds because I was like a tornado of punishment. The Pogues are the ultimate dichotomy, a boy band with angry music. Don't let their teen beat cover looks fool you, this band can play. Go get it or you will fall even further back in your hopeless race to be like me.

0789723107|3.0|As a professor using this book in a Human Computer Interface Design course, this book is a great primer for getting students to do some basic thinking about user behaviors, and appropriate design solutions. It contains easy-to-understand explanations and examples with images and diagrams that make reading it simple and enjoyable. I found that it does communicate some things I found difficult to put into words - things we take for granted that people are not aware of...<br /><br />If I were only teaching basic todo's I would use this as my only text, however I do supplement it with some info. architecture materials. It does worry me that people do not realize some of the basic concepts introduced in the book, but that seems to be the nature of web designers - since anyone can really stick up a site online now. If you are a web design professional, I would hope you would opt for a book that inspires some 'higher-level thinking' or more conceptual 'bigger-picture' case studies. But if you consider yourself oblivious to what is going on inside a user's head when they're using a site, I suggest either giving up web design or purchase this book.
0679737456|4.0|Black Ice <br />Review by Ana Santos <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like all my peers to read Black Ice written by Lorene Cary, because it talks about her life in general how she was sent to a high school that she did not know anything about.  My peers should know that the book is an autobiography so it is talking about her teenage life in high school.  This is a book for peers that like to know about others peoples life, how they changed, and what affected them.  If you like, these books I recommend you to read this text.  Lorene was kind of forced or pushed to go to St. Paul boarding school.  In addition, these are how her high school years were going and how much she accomplished.  For example, Lorene was obligated to have intimate relations with her boyfriend, but she did not do anything about the fact that she was forced.  In addition, Lorene used drugs, but she quitted before she became addicted.  After all, Lorene made great choices that helped her graduate fro   St. Paul.  From my impression, the autobiography is not so hard to read because you can understand what it saying.  The texts portion is short; however, it takes time to comprehend the significance of \\"Black Ice.\\"  You can read this text twice and you will get the significance of the text.  I think every one would accept to read this autobiography.  The book has to be read critically.  I personally think my peers should read with a lot of time.   <br /> <br />

B000002H97|4.0|I don't know why people like to say this is the album where metallica lost their sound.  I think they were just continuing from where they were doing on ...And Justice for All.  There are some good songs like Of Wolf and Man or Holier Than Thou.  There are some very good solo's on here to like on Enter Sandman or The Unforgiven.  But one track that does get me is Nothing Else Matters.  Which is a very profound track.  So deep on complex even for a Metallica song.  Yet saying this Metallica didn't quite sound like they did in their earlier work but Every album sounds different so it's just part of the evolution of Metallicas Sound.  I am a big fan of Metal and I love this album.  People may say it's where Metallica stopped being great but really they don't pay attention to the musicianship put into this album.  It was their Last great album before the likes of S&M, Load, Re-Load, and ST.Anger.

B000006MV8|4.0|Those fans of the late sixties/early seventies era in popular music will find this compilation of Badfinger's music an excellent addition.  Only the absence of their hit \\"Come and Get It\\" denies it the coveted fifth star.  This reviewer, age 52, believes Badfinger to have been underrated, and more than deserving of a revival of their work.  Perhaps this is due to the tragic suicides of two of their members.  Even so, the songs still \\"stand up\\" well, what with over 35 years having passed.  Highly recommended.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I have been a long-time Green Day fan so I can't denounce this album on too many grounds.  It has some interesting songs on it. I like all the singles, but as a whole, it's not worth actually buying unless you wanna get the full feel of the album (the \\"rock opera\\" deal).  The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the tone or mood of many of the songs; a little too emo-esque, like dark, depressing songs most emo kids would buy into. <br />Nonetheless, Green Day has made a comeback and this album is pretty good work, and to those who denounce the album itself: a Grammy award and 7 out of 8 VMAs can't support those negative claims.
1591396190|3.0|The authors, regular contributors to the Harvard Business Review, have created a book from their previous writings.  It's a nice little book, easy to read, with breezy overviews of hand picked examples but totally derivative.  However, the authors are 1000% correct in their fundamental points:  <br /> <br />It's better to find uncontested market space  <br />Your competition does become irrelevant - for a while. <br />Create and capture new demand. <br />Break the value/cost trade-off. <br />Align a company's whole system of activities in pursuit of differentiation and low cost. <br /> <br />Only one small problem with above - it's hard to do and they offer no real insights into the how.  In fact they only devote a handful of pages to the most important aspect of strategy and that is execution of the strategy.  That's a serious shortcoming of the book.   <br /> <br />I wish they did a better analysis of companies that tried to follow this strategy and failed.  That would have been very insightful.  I also wish that they weren't so superficial in their examples.  Case in point:  they reference Southwest Airlines and state that the change they instituted was a result of eliminating meals, and eliminating reservations.  They did do those things but they were the icing, not the cake.  They never once mention the real reasons they were so disruptive to the industry; Southwest abandoned the traditional hub and spoke model, they maximized the utilization rate of the planes by faster airport turnaround and they changed the labor paradigm dominant in the industry.   <br /> <br />They also didn't spend enough time discussing the fact that executing this strategy cannot create a sustainable competitive advantage.  They admit to this and discuss the Body Shop as one example.  Unfortunately, the best advice they offer up is once your advantage disappears you need to repeat the Blue Ocean process.  By the way there are even fewer examples of companies doing this recreation successfully in the real world. <br /> <br />I liked some of the graphics they created.  I especially liked the graphic that shows where a company spends its resources.  They used it to represent the before and after picture for a company.  I find this is a great tool and give them credit for it.  Some of the other tools they describe are OK.  I found them a bit confusing, especially the use of a six by six analysis matrix but they are obviously going to leverage their work to create a consulting business.   <br /> <br />Why did I say this book was derivative?  Although the book is packaged cleverly it does not represent much original thought.  One reviewer mentioned that Christiansen's Innovators Dilemma is a better book.  I totally agree.  You would also see a lot of the Blue Ocean themes in Pralahad and Hamel's book, Competing for the Future.  Lastly, I found the references to traditional strategy amusing, especially the knocks on Porter.  I can't really tell if they've been following the evolution of Porter's thinking but I suspect they haven't.  It's not all Red Ocean.   <br /> <br />Is this a bad book?  Certainly not.  Is it worth buying?  You could do worse.  I would just read the authors HBR articles and save the money.  Will you learn something?  Probably.  Are there better thought leaders in the field?  Absolutely. <br />
6304602979|5.0|I remember the first time I watched this movie - I don't think I had more fun watching any other movie than this one.  Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay for this movie, but sold the rights to direct it.  I was actually quite happy about it as I don't particular like his directing style, but I do like his \\"writing skills\\".  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette star in this action packed bloody dark comedy, and although they did a pretty good job, I can't give them all the credit.  The supporting cast is outstanding.  When you have such names as Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, and Brad Pitt, just to name a few, you can't possible have a bad movie.

B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning: is probably one of my more favorited Green Day albums and it is pretty awesome.  Most people complain about it being too pop-oriented and not enough punk sound to it.

0446343129|5.0|I cannot add much more to the positive reviews that indicate how the book clearly identifies the negative affects of sugar (and refined and processed foods, by extension) on the human body. The book delves into the detrimental developmental, mental/psychiatric, and physiological affects that sugar has on the human body.  Just a few points that I would like to point out to potential readers of this book: <br /> <br />(1.) Some of the very few negative reviews point out that the book is a one-track, narrowly focused diatribe against refined sugar (The author very clearly makes a distinction between natural carbohydrates and natural sugars as opposed to refined processed sugars and refined carbohydrates which is something that cannot be overlooked). I thoroughly disagree. There is a consistent and very powerful underlying theme throughout the book....the fact that throughout history the food industry and the medical/pharmaceutical industry have monetarily thrived off of each other at the expense of public health and human welfare. (and in my opinion, they knowingly did so and do so). This is not a conspiratorial left-winged angle on the theme of the book that the author pushes on the reader, but rather a theme that is supported throughout the European and American sugar history. The author uses this richly detailed historical backdrop to reinforce not only the perils and hazards of sugar, but to also provide perhaps an explanation (and motive) as to why and how refined sugar has become so pervasive in society. As is often the case, greed and monetary interests provide the very motives for the medical establishment's \\"looking the other way\\" in the face of overwhelming evidence pointing to the health hazards of sugar. The author leverages these historical actions effectively in telling the \\"story\\" and providing the facts. Admittedly, some of the facts are wholly anecdotal in nature, but nevertheless they serve the purpose to reinforce the overall theme of the book. At the core, this is the food industry \\"lobbying\\" for the pharmaceutical industry's interests, and vise versa. Consider this: <br />1.Cholesterol free foods, fat free foods-----Cholesterol lowering drugs.  Health issues: Good fats (fish oil, Omega 9's)totally eliminated. Absence of these fats induces cardiovascular problems. Cholesterol in and of itself is not damaging to arteries and endothelial function, but the absence healthy fats and statins cause a host of other cardiovascular issues. <br />2.Polished refined white rice------Vitamin B1 derived from whole grain rice (they initially were able to market B1; there is no money to be made from B1 anymore so they have moved on). The author spends a chapter asking why was it removed in the first place? \\"How to Complicate Simplicity\\" all for the sake of money and greed. <br />3.Refined sugar-------Psychiatry for a host of mental illnesses. Insulin. Allergy industry. All very profitable <br />4.MSG, food additives--------Psychiatry and pharmaceuticals for a host of neurological disorders <br />5.Transfatty acids for fat free food-------Cardiovascular and vascular medications to deal with the problems transfatty acids cause. Transfats were substituted for natural fats all in the name of low fat heart healthy foodstuffs! The food and pharmaceutical industries making money for each other. <br /> <br />The pharmaceutical and established medical industry have one motive to look the other way when the perils of refined carbohydrates/sugars are discussed: Money and Greed. These \\"foods\\" supply their care industries with patients....\\"How to complicate simplicity\\"... <br /> <br /> <br />(2.)One must also keep in mind that the book was written originally in 1976. Since then, many of the medical disease states presented in the book have been thoroughly researched, studied, and clinically proven to be caused by refined carbohydrates and sugars. Naysayers are the pharmaceutical industry and the processed food industry. Greed. <br /> <br />(3.)The book in not meant to be a scientific double blind clinical study on the perils of refined sugar, but rather presents the reader with historical and anecdotal facts that point to one conclusion: the damaging effects of refined sugar on the human body and mind. <br /> <br />(4.) Another negative review pointed out that carbohydrates are necessary for proper human metabolic function. The review incorrectly states that the book bears relevance only to people who are insulin resistant or diabetic.  The whole point of the book is preventative food medicine. Once you are insulin resistant or diabetic, the damage has been done and is very difficult to reverse. The book points out that the fastest way to do the damage (to the adrenals, insulin receptive cells, pancreas, etc.)is through the consumption of refined sugar. The author (even way back in 1976) was also very clear to provide a distinction between processed refined carbohydrates (focusing on the worst of them, refined sugar) and natural carbohydrates (pure unrefined unpolished brown rice as opposed to processed refined polished white rice, for example). Natural carbs are an essential part of a well balanced diet. <br />
B0000AC8LZ|5.0|Although, I do know people who loved this movie and never worked in the so-called \\"corporate\\" environment.  This movie is one of those \\"sleepers\\" that you never hear of and then it takes everybody by surprise and all of sudden everybody starts talking about it.  It's probably my favorite comedy of all time.  The movie was written and directed by a guy named Mike Judge.  You might have heard of him, the creator of Beavis and Butthead.  How did he come up with an idea for this movie is still beyond my understanding.  He probably took Dilbert cartoon character and decided to make a movie about him.  The result - one hilarious comedy.

Except for \\"la tortura\\" most songs are quite depressive and without her so characterized latin rythm.  <br /> <br />Because we are used to Shakira's ability to release success after success, this album is a disapointment.
B0006284JQ|3.0|Although I disagree with some people that this CD had to be titled \\"greatest hits\\", it's a pretty good compilation. Basically, the singles are all my favorites. Even the new tracks with \\"My Prerogative\\" and \\"Do Something\\" among them. The only problem that I have with this disc is that either some past released singles aren't featured, such as \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\"(which were two of my favorite Britney ballads), along with tracks that are featured, but got a dissatisfied extreme makeover(i.e.:\\"Boys\\" and \\"Overprotected\\"). The folks @ Jive Records should've compiled this CD the same way they've compiled her video collection on the DVD(yes, I have that, too). But overall, the disc is pretty good if you're still a fan of Britney's past work.

B00003CXFG|5.0|Considering that this was a low-budget film, shot in the Australian outback...they did a hell of a good job. Although the script was weak, Radha Mitchell pulled off an excellent performance. I believe that all of the actors in this film should be commended for turning what should have been a total bomb into an entertaining, action-packed joy ride. Vin Diesel was also very convincing as Riddick. He too pulled off a marvelous performance. The action was spine tingling and edged-of-your-seat stuff.

0380807343|5.0|\\"Coraline\\" is a great book. It can get remotely creepy. Here's my review: <br /> <br />Coraline has just moved in with her parents into a new house, which is not so new. Coraline {or Caroline to some}, is a bored girl who discovers a door behind a bricked-up wall in her room which leads to another world, to another mother and another father who have liquid-paper white skin and black buttons for eyes. When Coraline gets back to her world, her parents are missing and she finds out that her other mother has captured them with lost children's souls, and the only thing that Coraline has left afterwards is a friendship with a talking cat, and the only choice of a challenge with her other mother just to get her parents back. If she loses, her other mother keeps her there forever, and if Coraline wins, her other mother has to give one of her hands and Coraline would get her parents back to her world.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game written by Orson Scott Card is a science-fiction book somewhat complicated to read. The author switches from two points in the story so every chapter may be confusing.  There are also many characters in the book that you have to remember about in order to fully understand the books true meaning.  The characters in the book had a lot of effect on Ender's decisions or perspective throughout the book.  For example at the beginning of the book Ender's brother give him the idea that the monitor the scientists put on him to examine his thinking was a bad thing and made him look like a dork. Of course Ender's brother was just jealous because of him not wearing the monitor as long as his smart brother.   <br /> If you like books with a twist in them then you will definitely like Ender's Game.  In other words, Ender's Game is a text about little kid geniuses being raise in certain situations and in camps to be trained to fight aliens and save the human race.  Ender is one of the more advanced geniuses and can tackle any problem.  Ender has many enemies that don't like him because of his bigger mental capacity then them. Plus, everybody knows Ender needs to be protected by everyone so he can save the world. But, deep down Ender is a scared, timid boy but the situation he's in makes him the strong one and make him surpass his fears. Ender's Game is an intricate book that will pleasure any reader. <br />
B000641ZA4|5.0|What the Editorial Reviewer fails to mention is that the audio on each song has been re-mixed from the original multi-track recordings and is in DTS 5.1 for those that have DTS equiptment.  The surround mixes are outstanding.  The video's are as they were when they first came out, no issues there.  What blew my mind the most was Home By The Sea & 2nd HBTS.  WOW!  Since the original 'Genesis' self titled album has always sounded so dull to me, this was a amazing change in sound. <br />Now, if they could just get the SACD's out they've been re-mixing, and promissing!

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Like most, when I first heard that Sufjan Stevens intended to record individual albums for every state in the union, I was simultaneously baffled and amazed.  Several thoughts arose at once?  For instance, can anyone actually live long enough and be productive enough to do fifty albums?  How the heck to you do an album about Delaware?  How can an artist produce an album about a state of which he has little or no first hand knowledge?  All in all, it has to go down as one of the strangest projects in the history of popular music.<br /><br />This is the second of Stevens's projected series, and luckily for me covers one of the two states that I would be most personally interested in, Illinois, my adopted home.  (The other state I'd love to see covered is Arkansas, the state of my birth and upbringing.)  Having now listened to ILLINOISE several times, two more thoughts have arisen:  First, he is really going to record this much music for each state?  This disc clocks in at over seventy minutes!  In the old days, that would have been the equivalent of a double LP!  Second, how does he crank out so much great music?  First, I have to say that the album might have been improved by shortening it a bit.  There are a few weak cuts, and I think removing those songs would have made this an even better album.  But even with that, the number of very strong songs on the album is amazing.  I figure the average very good album has three or four truly good songs to go with several other decent ones.  ILLINOISE has at least five or six songs that are absolutely first rate, along with a host of others that are at least memorable.  Can he keep this up?  Can he sustain this through Nevada and Oregon and Mississippi and Florida?  My brother asked in a letter whether Stevens might not be the Walt Whitman of our age.  Certainly no other troubadour since Whitman has tried to so completely express the nature of the country as a whole.<br /><br />To multiply the perplexities, the best song on the disc might be one about the mass murderer John Wayne Gacy.  How is that possible?  Moreover, the adjective that most fully describes the song is:  pretty.  My other favorites include \\"Decatur,\\" \\"Chicago\\" (How could you do an album on Illinois and botch Chicago? Well, you could but luckily he does not), \\"The Man of Metropolis,\\" and \\"The Tallest Man.\\"  The topics he covers in his songs runs the gamut of Illinois history, from Mary Todd Lincoln's insanity to the Blackhawk wars to the aforementioned John Wayne Gacy to the musical heritage of Chicago.<br /><br />Will Sufjan be able to keep this up?  Will his next album be as good as this one?  I honestly can't say, though anyone who could keep this up through 50 albums would instantly qualify as one of the greats in music.  I doubt if he can, but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I await his next album with heightened curiosity.g on the disc might be one about the mass murderer John Wayne Gacy.

B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|In my opinion and from what i read to, this is one of the greatest achivments in Computer-Animated Comedys. <br />A young robot named Rodny Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), dreams of meeting Bigweld (Mel Brooks), a very populor inventor in the robot world, and representnig his own invention to him. <br />But when rodny gets kicked out of Bigwelds place, because he is outdated, Rodny finds himself with street robots that are outdated to, and whose parts aren't sold anymore. these robots are my favorite charichters in the movie, because they are so colerful, when they have upon them Fender (Robin Williams), a robot that is literally falling apart, and helps Rodny on his way to find Bigweld when he mysteriously disapperes. and of course a moviel like this (or any movie, anyway) wouldn't be right without it's villians, Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), a sleek uptadetd Robot that is determined to make sure Bigweld stays well out of his way so that he can take over his factory, and Maddam Gasket (Jim Broadbent)Ratchets evil mother who will do anything to get herself and her son in to power.  <br />i saw this movie at the theater and i pre orded this item, the second i heard it was available, and if your convinced by the good reviews i advise you to buy this movie, i hope you enjoy the movie as much as i did, it sure gave me some laughs. <br /> <br />PS. the soundtrack for this movie is great to, its available on itunes if you have an ipod.
6305537321|4.0|Years before The Coen Brothers unleashed their trademark eccentric characters and even before Woody Allen got on the scene with his endless talkies, Blake Edwards gave us this subtle but weird comedy that seems to be overlooked by most audiences desensitised by films like Mud in Manhattan, Hitch and the latest Bridget Jones crap.<br /><br />What most of these films lack is a strong sense of character and involvement in their world. You really do feel drawn into the relationship between Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), a teenage runaway who ended up a high-class escort in New York and Paul 'Fred' Varjak (a youthful George Peppard) a writer/gigolo who has had nothing to inspire him of late until Holly came into his life. The only time caricature comes into the film is Mickey Rooney's Japanese landlord (and he's not Japanese), but he hardly features that much for it to be annoying.<br /><br />The film has a lot in common with There's Something About Mary, which I am sure owes most of its ideas to. Almost every man who meets Holly falls head over heels in love with her but it takes someone just like her for Holly to love back. Both Holly and Paul are struggling to make their own way in the city. Both have to sell themselves to the opposite sex in order to make ends meet. While Paul just wants to be a successful writer, Holly is desperate to marry a rich millionaire to snag some of the fortune for herself and take care of her brother once he leaves the army. Her escort girl lifestyle is taking its toll on her so much that 6am is only the end of the night for her and not morning. As a result she eats a fast food breakfast on a deserted street while longingly window-shopping at Tiffany's, a shop she'll probably never afford to buy from. However you just know that, despite not having much money, Holly and Paul will take good care of each other by the end of the movie.<br /><br />What gives this film a unique charm on top of the performances are the many oddball moments and quirky touches. Most of them supplied by Holly's cat, known simply as Cat. And Henry Mancini's score (before he and Blake Edwards teamed up for the famous Pink Panther) seems right out of a Broadway musical and plays a strong part in making the movie what it is. There's no generic piano cues or pop songs here.<br /><br />I haven't read the book so I cannot compare like so many other people here have, but the film certainly does stand up on it's own. No film sticks entirely to the books they are based on anyway.<br /><br />The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with re-mastered Dolby 5.1 sound. There are no extras at all. Which is puzzling considering the film's praise.them supplied by Holly's cat, known simply as Cat.

B00006FM77|5.0|As most reviewers agree, this is a 5 star live recording.  One person gave it 1 star, yet he agrees with the other reviews?  I don't know how they did it, but whoever remastered this recording did an outstanding job.  The sound quality is now comparible to Chicago's other masterpiece \\"Live in Japan\\" (which for whatever reason is now out of print).  If you don't have this new Carnegie Hall release... get it.  If you don't have \\"Live in Japan\\"... keep looking hard and get it too, if you can find it.  Both of these CD's are different, but equally outstanding in there own ways.  Don't expect commercial sounding pop ballads here. These CD's are the \\"real deal\\" with the sound that \\"put Chicago on the map\\".  A sound that hasn't been heard before or since.  Thankfully, these recordings have preserved that sound.

0380778556|5.0|This was my first summer reading book in high school, which I chose merely because it was the only alternative to plowing through 'The Good Earth'. Picking up from the library a rigid, hard-bound novel with a very official lack of cover art, titled merely \\"Rebecca\\", inspired much skepticism within me that this would turn out to be yet another lovey-dubby romance. Much to my surprise, I was hooked after the first tinglingly-detailed page, and spent almost an entire month reading and re-reading a book that could easily be read in a few days, chapter by chapter.<br /><br />'Rebecca' is an amazing work of art. The story of a confused, selfless young woman, seeking to satisfy the incredible expectations of the world, it is inerwoven with both poignant and chilling symbolism, and a plotline bent with enough hairpin twists to leave any reader gasping and clinging to the book like a caffeine addict. As the novel progresses, the reader is drawn into the precariously-balanced life of the nameless narrator, seeing much of humanity reflected throughout the novel's pages, in the way beloved goddesses turn out to be mere succubi, nightmares turn out to be reality, and most importantly, and with a certain amount of paradox, seemingly empty love turns out to be much, much richer and deeper than previously imagined. 'Rebecca' is a gripping, wonderfully-written novel about the human heart itself that will leave any reader in an emotional mixture of satisfaction and unease.<br /><br />If it ever appears on your summer reading list, seize the opportunity.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|OK.  First the venting.     I just hate having to listen to or be associated with inexperienced listeners when they think they know what they're talking about.  I hear a lot of comparisons to The Used and even Nickelback, and Breaking Benjamin.  The worst part is that these off base comparisons go one step further and accuse 30 seconds of TRYING to be like them.    If you have been listening to music for years and actually paying attention, you'd realize that 30 seconds can be said to sound influenced by MANY bands of the 80s and some 90s (the Cure, U2, depeche mode, deftones, orgy, incubus, bjork etc).  But to skip that step and think that a 30 something like Leto would be trying to copy The Used is so uninsightful it should be stricken from memory.     ON to the album.....OK while still venting.  People's first reactions to new discs are often extreme regarding bands they like.  Its so painfully obvious here.  Its just not true that 30 seconds lost their sound.  I admit that there is probably less of what stuck out as a futuristic sound.  The album is probably farther down the scale from avante garde to mainstream.  But there is so much in common with the last album.    I actually had a song in my head today and had to ask myself which album it was off of. (this is partly because it seemed too familiar to be coming from a week old disc, and partly because THE DISCS HAVE A LOT IN COMMON).    So take comfort in the fact that you have a very good disc from the same band (what have you done in the last 3 years lazies - myself included).  And if they write enough material, you might get everything you're looking for over time.  But in the meantime we have to remember that we got lucky that the first album sounded just right to us....and this one is closer to that particular sound than anything else out there. In fact many people will like this one more...they just didn't buy the album the first week because they weren't fans yet.      My friends and I actually managedto harass Leto after a show about 3 years ago, and asked him where they could go on future albums considering they had such a strong and unusual theme.  He didn't have an extravagant answer, but just said not to take the Mars thing too literally, that its more of a symbol of reaching out.      So it only makes sense that the lyrical and sonic direction of future discs is going to go much more into the realm of the reality we know and only occasionally go head first into the \\"space metal\\" thing.      I think the Mars thing is an appealing escape, but who can make their entire music career (every song, every album cover, every lyric) relate to such an abstract idea. There has to be room for real world subject matter and a real world feel to come in also.      But yea....hopefully plenty more creative and unusual space metal to come.

B00004Z459|5.0|The band Linkin Park's first entry into the music market is their debut album `Hybrid Theory'. The name they say comes from trying to combine many different genres all into one album. From hard rock, to melodic beats, to scratching and techno, all can be found here. The band consists of five members: Chester Bennington (vocals), Mike Shinoda (vocals, guitar, keyboard, and sampling), Joe Hahn (turntables and sampling), Brad Delson (guitar), Rob Bourdon (drums), and Dave Farrell (bass). Hybrid theory is one of my all time favorite albums and has enough sustanance to keep you hooked throughout the entire album. Some songs to watch out for are the following five: <br />1. \\"Papercut\\". This song has a nice overlap between the two vocalists and has some nice vocal effects for added distinction. Although not my favorite, it still places high on the list. I give it an 8/10.  <br />2 \\"One Step Closer\\". One of the great parts about this one is the catchy baseline along with the scratching to provide a unique sound. Lyrics are somewhat original but it feels like you've heard them somewhere before. I give it a 7.5/10.  <br />4. \\"Points of Authority\\", my  second personal favorite. It begins soft and then big bang of guitars widens your ears. To me this song has one of  the best combos of techno, rock, lyrics, editing, the whole smack. I will never tire of hearing this song. It gets a 10/10.   <br />5. \\"Crawling\\". My third favorite. This song starts loud and softens to a nice melodic beat with soothing lyrics. It just feels powerful overall. I give it 9.5/10. <br />8. \\"In the End\\". My all time favorite. Like \\"Crawling\\" it has a sense of depth with a nice piano melody in the background. Most original lyrics on the song and great sampling to round it out. Nothing not to like about this one, it scores a 10/10. <br />The remaining seven: \\"With You\\", \\"Runaway\\" , \\"By Myself\\", \\"A Place for My Head\\", \\"Forgotten\\", \\"Cure for the Itch\\", and \\"Pushing Me Away\\" are all worthy songs as well butnot quite up to the extroardinary level of the first five noted. By far the best \\"good songs per dollar\\" album of any I have owned.   <br />

0345440900|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend of a friend when I expressed the \\"normal\\" nervousness and anxiety of being a first time mommy.  She supposedly raved about it and went on about how much it helped her when she had her first child and how she couldn't have been better prepared without reading this book...ok, with no disrespect to her or anyone else that might feel the same way - I know many of us THINK that we are lost and anticipation and fear take over a couple months before our first child is born, but COME ON!  A couple days or so after my son was born, motherly instinct snuck up out of nowhere and before I even had a chance to realize it, I didn't have to think about what needed to be done or how - I just did, NATURALLY.  Given, I breastfed on demand for the first month until my son developed his own eating schedule of every 2-3 hours and gradually decreased to every 3-4 hours as he got older.  The \\"activities\\" and sleep schedule fell into place almost perfectly and almost identical to the \\"E.A.S.Y.\\" routine the author claims to have developed and so strongly recommends - the entire basis of the book.    I definitely agree with other reviewers in regards to the breastfeeding section - Tracy doesn't sound like a breastfeeding advocate & does say that she believes formula is \\"just as good\\" - NOTHING compares to God's creation - whether scientifically advanced, generated, altered, etc. or any other man-made invention.  Formula, IN MY OPINION, should be used as a last resort.  Breastfeeding difficulties do arise and are completely understandable and many of us have to return to work asap but this choice is that of the mother and the mother only.  \\"Lactation Consultants\\" should be unbiased in their opinion and give detailed advice on both methods - Tracy Hogg lacks greatly in this aspect and doesn't convey a supportive attitude with her choice of words.     Note:  It wasn't all that bad!  I did find the chapter on distinctive cries beneficial.  Hogg included  descriptions of such, how to distinguish & interpret their meanings and how to act accordingly.  That did come to great use!  Eventually, you will learn that the different cries coincide with your baby's routine and be able to distinguish his/her needs by their schedule but nonetheless, this section helped.    Although I haven't read any so do not have any alternative recommendations, I feel like there might be a better \\"how to\\" book to prep you for the big day of childbirth and the early days of motherhood...good luck & God Bless!
B0002OERI0|1.0|What a sad-sad band. These guys have always yearned to be considered a real punk band. Even though their records sound about as agressive as a \\"Gin Blossoms\\" album, these boys have always insisted that they are a punk band.  It obviously means the world to them to be revered as \\"real\\" punk rockers. Over the years, they have attempted to step things up in order to more closely resemble the punk rock image that they are so obsessed with. They thought playing faster, singing with a fake British punk accent, getting more tattoos, and dying their hair would surely land them in punk rock territory. Well now they are just trying way too hard with their gutter-punk look, and frankly it has become pathetic.  I mean come on guys, who is falling for this act anymore. Look at Billie Joe wearing creepers, sporting skin tight trousers, and smudging make-up on his goofy face...what a tool! What happened to the band that was known for writing goofy pop songs about farting and smoking weed? What happened to Billie Joe and his non-punk dread locks?  They decided it was time to get poltical...just what the world needs;  to know how 3 uneducated morons view politics, a subject which I can guarantee they know very little about. Listen to BJ's little political rant in the middle of \\"Holiday.\\" Yeah, you're really going to change the world with that predictable nonsense. I am sure some 12 year old kid out there got really fired up over your words of rebellion...Good job! And as far as making a punk concept album about a kid trying to find something to rebel against, that story-line sounds a little too close Billie Joe in his quest to becoming a real punker. Somebody needs to tell these guys that they are just too damn old to be still trying so hard to be punkers..This kind of ridiculousness is tolerable when you're 13 years old, but when you're in your 30's with a wife and kids, searching for the ultimate rebellious punk look is simply despicable. I thought \\"warning\\" was a good album.  Songs were well written, and I felt that the band was just being themselves. But with American Idiot, they are just reaching and the songs simply suck. And what is wrong with Trey Cool? It's good to have a sense of humor, but can this guy ever be serious for one f*&%ing second? Or is he trapped in a permanent state of retardedness? If you bothered to spend your money on this record,you are the \\"American Idiot\\" that the band is referring to.  Thank you, good night.
0962477060|5.0|If you really are wanting to play the guitar then Fretboard Logic is a must. Other systems say alot of nothing, talking in circles. To play means being able to play with others, understanding the fretboard will let you play accuratly with anyone. Half knowledge does not make a acomplished player not even for those playing for just themselves. I Teach guitar and have played for 35 years. This system is the only one I use, regardless of age.
B000784WMW|5.0|I've also seen the 1996 version by Franco Zeffirelli (with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt) and the 1997 version by Robert Young (with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds). All three have their strengths and weaknesses, but this 1983 BBC version is by far the most accurate and true to detail. It's impossible to fit Charlotte Brontë's imaginitive narration into a two-hour movie, a problem less acute in this four-hour mini-series.<br /><br />At first I was afraid Timothy Dalton as the tortured Edward Rochester would be too well-groomed for the part, but his experience as a Shakespearean performer makes up for any 007 biases I might have had. He brings out Rochester's dark, passionate nature with the necessary flair.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke is wonderful as Jane Eyre. She portrays Jane's inner conflicts and her upright yet passionate personality with the subtlety required for this difficult part. Of course Zelah doesn't look eighteen -- I believe she was twenty-six at the time of filming -- but she fits the part beautifully. It's a pity she disappeared from acting after this series.<br /><br />*** CAREFUL !!! SPOILERS !!! ***<br /><br />In the other JE versions, the last part of the novel, in which Jane flees Thornfield and -- unbeknown to her -- meets her cousins, is usually shortened to the point of embarrassment. In both the 1996 and 1997 version, the two Rivers sisters are merged into one person. In the 1996 version it's Mary, in the 1997 version it's Diana, whereby Jane's lawyer Briggs is merged into her cousin St. John in the latter rendition.<br /><br />Not so in the 1983 mini-series. Here we have the full account, with all its philosophical, social, and religious implications. As Jane escaped unrestrained passion and the loss of her integrity when she fled Thornfield, she escapes the abnegation of her heart and feelings when she flees a loveless marriage with St. John.<br /><br />For all fans of Charlotte Brontë and Jane Eyre, this DVD is a MUST!

B00030590I|5.0|Stunning.  Graceful.  Such a movie deserves to be in any movie collection.   <br /> <br />It's better then Hosue of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger.  The story can be hard to follow, but just sit back and enjoy the flow.  Think The Usual Suspects with flowing robes, wirework, and assassins.  I love this movie, and I think I'll go watch it now; writing the review has made me hungry for it.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I liked the original Underworld but to the degree of it being a 3 1/2 versus this version, which does a much better job at maintaining continuity and fleshing out the storyline so that many questions from the original were answered, and one backstory made the character's intentions much more viable.    I found a lot of silly plot holes in the theatrical version of Underworld and to some degree wonder who directed this film as Len Wiseman borrowed very heavily, particularly from The Matrix franchise. There are others but beyond seeing Neo make a guest appearence, Underworld was tainted by how heavily it followed it's Matrix leanings.    The good news is the increased depth in characters. Intentions are better explained, and not in a super talky way, nor a non-stop video montage, both typical of the gothic horror genre.    While the Romeo and Juliet theme is a bit stronger in this version of the film it was unavoidably obvious from the theatrical version, though there are signs Wiseman is more than adept at cloning genres with the occasional 'art film' dual themes played out over 2 or 3 minutes.    That's one thing about film that people can easily forget. Adding, removing or editing a more concise segment or two can make the film vastly more enjoyable past the bullets and blood.    Kate Beckensdale does a fine job as an action starlet, something punctuated by her work in The Aviator, another stretch from the costumed period pieces she'd been known for. Both films show her to be comfortable in any genre. Underworld does for Beckensdale what Fight Club did for equally well rounded and beautiful Helena Bonham Carter.     Both roles were breakthrough in that they were so out of character as to be potential career blunders. Thankfully for screengoers both actresses aquitted themselves nicely, Beckensdale even more than Bonham Carter, as Carter's role was a scene stealing, tremendous character. Here, Kate Beckensdale is the lead actor and has substantially more screen timeto make or break her performance.    The only odd thing about Underworld not fixed were the various British actors sounding like East End thru high society London, the additions of Eastern European laced English coming from figures one might expect to see in a Czeck or Polish film, along with the 2004 style U.S. male actor, Scott Speedman for example, who sounds nearly stupid and inarticulate at times. Having seen him in other films such as the indie, low budget or B film, \\"The 24th Day\\" - youu choose the adjective, wasn't exactly mainstream though his performance was explosive and so much in character in than Underworld. The film has the gothic, European look with characters that work until you hear SoCal actors subtracting from the mood. In the Director's cut, Speedman's character is given 3 dimensions and the film benefits, but they whole unknown town theme is lost by the hodegpoge of three or four English speaking styles. It still doesn't work, although the new version explains more about Spendman's character, which sheds light on a lot of his behavior in the film.    The new version proves, at least to my satisfaction, that good old filmaking skills are required beyond special effects, be they physical or CGI. The premise needs to be good, the script needs to be acceptable, the actors need to know their craft and the director needs to have a vision. Underworld isn't the first film to have been damaged in the editor's hands. See Blind Horizon - great cast, overworked premise and literally, hijacked film. When the editor is the person doing the film's voice over track you know there's trouble. When the director is a ghost, you know better or worse, the film wasn't his any longer. And finally, when the editor starts discussing the remaking of the film by resequencing segments and changing genre from mystery to action film, you know there are some serious problems. Oh, and when you see some of the deleted scenes and think, \\"hmm, this looks like it was better thanthe film I just watched\\" you know something very bad happened.     And while that wasn't the case with the original Underworld versus the new cut, it certainly was missing a lot of important things, like exposition, depth of character and overall, better flow to the film than the original release.    Verdict - Underworld Directors Cut is a better film than the original. It's pace is as quick as before but more gets through, and in this case, more is better. If you sat on the border about this film as I had it might bring you into the fan's camp. Most important, the film loses nothing from it's original release.    As for buying it in a lavish 2 CD box? The first DVD has a good selection of extras, many similar or the same to the original release. DVD 2 has several new and interesting/insightful video that help explain how various areas of the film were made. There is considerable extras from the original release's already generous extras.     If extras motivate you, there's plenty new mateirial to enjoy. If you loved the original, you might be curious and want to at least rent, though some stores don't include extra discs from what I've heard, and the extras are worthwhile. Most of all, if you were like me and felt something was missing from the theatrical release then this is worth a view, and quite possibly, a purchase.    My rating is not quite a five star film, but it's a steady 4, perhaps higher as I watch it more. There is no doubt it is a better film than Underworld and if you haven't purchased the original this is certainly the way to go.    The only question I have is whether they could have featured both cuts as they did in the new Alien series. Those discs are so dense with information you'd have to book a day to get through them, which brings me to my question. Why couldn't the original Underworld cut been available on this release?    Greed, I suspect. Why stop at a measly two editions when there's the Platinum Superbit with 12:1:1 stereo and five different encoders built in so every computer known to mankind can play it back and make some money at the software end as most of these technologies are sold independently at $15 a codec.    Am I jaded? You bet I am. Art is still product and if the CD/DVD companies are good at, and it certainly isn't creativity on the music side, the film side will squeeze the last penny from you given the chance. Still think I'm jaded? How about this...Batman Begins is already being released in one and two DVD collections with close to the same price, but one with extra features. I haven't seen it but it wouldn't surprise me at all if the second disc was unnecessary and only made to differentiate which version had more stuff on it. Still not convinced? How many releases of Aliens were there already before this new crop of re-edited and original?    Be that the case. I'd reccomend this over the feature release version.
B0006J28BO|4.0|We've all felt like Haru at one point or the other, clumsy, cluttered and unsure of ourselves, and I totally related to her while watching the film.  A coming-of-age style story with a fantasy twist, 'The Cat Returns' is a delightful movie I watch at least monthly.    While not a Myazaki as many expect, it is charming and elegant, with memorable characters you instantly feel something for and a journey I wish I could take.  Hiroyuki Morita has a bright future and I hope to see more of him!
B000026FOA|1.0|OK, boomers.  Light some incense, light something else, close your eyes, hit Play.  If you don't visualize a concert hall stage that looks like a huge altar with Donovan Leitch (aka Donovan) strumming soulful tunes as the centerpiece, sorry you missed it.  Although Nick Drake plays a nice guitar, only 17 y.o. boys trying to display a sensitive side to their 16 y.o. girlfriends should expect any magic from this one.  Wispy, poetic, and some pieces heavily orchestrated with strings - a warning I did not heed.  I bought this from a recommendation off the Garden State soundtrack.  Although I generally like that one, some of the songs are similar - aenemic, immature, weak, something.  I'm not a rocker per se, and indeed my beloved Radiohead can drift over into dreary unconnectedness, but Five Leaves Left (title another clue?) is boring.  A+ in lilting-ness, if you're into that.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Han shot first.  My biggest complaint is simple.  Why make the new changes shiny and bright, while leave the rest of the movie dull?  If you're going to add Jabba, either make the new Jabba scene look like a muppet or update Jabba to make him look like the new one.  Don't include shiny new robots into the hive of scum and villainy.  It's a dead-end town on a dead-end planet no one bothers with.   <br /> <br />Leave the 'force field' under the landspeader alone!  It added a sence of realism and cheep.  Yes, landspeeders used a force field to get off the ground.  No, Luke couldn't afford a nice one.  It's like having a car with the muffler full of holes, you know?   <br /> <br />I don't mind small things, like making the Falcon spin a little as it leaves Bay 94.  (Wow, I had to look up what number it was!  My geek-powers are fading!)  But the new scene showing it lifting off wiht Stormtroopers shooting at it just doesn't mesh with the old pictures.  Blowing planets up, however, looks quite nice.  And the lightsabers look really good now.  But these few good points don't make up for the loss of the original movies.  Do't forget the stormtrooper making a 'BONK' as he hit his head on the beam. <br /> <br />Changing Anakin in the very ending to look like the modern actor was a logical idea, but screw it.  Hayden Christensen sucked. <br /> <br />All in all I'll watch my old VHS tapes over the new releases.  Too bad Lucas screwed up.
B0000033IR|5.0|Even though you have probably  heard most of these obviously essential RnB songs, cut by the Queen in her prime, you need to get this re-released version if only for one thing: the unedited version of Chain of Fools. The opening, which was trimmed for the version that made it on to the original album and single, is PURE UNADULTERATED SOUL. There is literally nothing like this minute or so of pure anguish turned into vocal sound. This IS soul. And this is Lady Soul. For fans who have the original, YES it is worth buying again. And for the curious, there is hardly a better place to begin.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|To those that didn't like this movie, it wasn't made for you.  It was made for those who love the Golden Age of comics, the anceint b-movies that show in Sci-Fi channel, and those who feel like they were born too late.  There are so many nods to other fiction, so many nods to the elegant era we don't live in anymore, so many nods to those who love.  It's a thing, really.  And if you don't get it, I can't explain, because you may never understand.
B00007KQA3|4.0|Excellent movie, Richard Burton and John Hurt delever top notch <br />performances, even though this movie is titled 1984, it is timeless, the sets are dark and moody, very reminisent of luftwaffa attacks in the WWII films that you see, In a day and  <br />age where our  civil rights are being disolved in the name of homeland security, this film hits more close to home than ever.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Porco Rosso is a rare gem of a movie.  It appealed to me in so many ways, and kept me interested from the very begining.  It's not Sprited Away, but then again, what is?  While not my favorite Myazaki movie, it's a great film and a wonderful piece of art.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Just one thing before I get my mini-review going... <br /> <br />\\"Like I always say to the brainwashed drones of MTV, \\"MTV shouldnt tell you whats cool and what isnt. Be original and make your own choices like an intelligent human being. Be unique\\" sheesh.\\" <br /> <br />...but listening to you is just fine, right? <br /> <br />My younger brother had a copy of the CD a while ago and I gave it a spin. I had heard some of the hype and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I knew I had to buy it. Right of the bat I thought the CD was solid, albeit a bit poppy in places. But then again, what's so bad about that?  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great CD to crank up and rock out with. But nobody does that anymore, I guess... <br />
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I first saw this movie as a kid.  My sister's boyfriend, who eventually worked for a game magazine reviewing imports and anime, had it at a time when anime and 'Japanimation' (I don't like that word, just use anime!) were relitively unknown, obscure, and badly copied from copies of copies.    Part of my misses that era of anime, when a new episode of Ranma 1/2 or the Project A-Ko movie was fan-subbed and somewhat blurry to watch.  Tenticle porn was everywhere and hard to advoid.  Certain people knew certain series, and trading tapes was a form of currancy.  This movie makes me feel nostalgia for such an era, but also instills in me a deal of awe.    This movie has held up, unlike the other anime I used to watch.  Ranma became the same story over and over, Bubblegum Crisis a cliche piece, A-Ko a nice little parody that I never watched again and so forth.  Only Nausica and a little less then a handful of others really stand out.    Nausica beats out almost any animation on the shelf today, and simply shines.  And that's not just the nostalgia talking, either.  It's intelligent, action packed, and if God could dub, he would dub this.

B0009UC7H0|5.0|I may have a slightly different take on this from the other Cussler fans out there. First I loved it, Second I thought it was better than the book.<br /><br />Ths is non-stop adventure yarn with the good parts of the Cussler story well entrenched. This is Drik Pitt as I always imagined him. Not only that but Steve Zahn does a magnificent job as Al, and William Macy as always becomes his parts and brings Sandecker to life.<br /><br />When I heard Matthew McConaughey was going to do Dirk Pitt I was skeptical and expected anopther lame disaster. McConaughey however did Pitt and became Pitt with all his \\"boyish charm\\" tempered by self confidence and never-give-up attitude.<br /><br />The reason I think it was better than the book is that of late - and that includes Sahara - which dates to 1992 - Cussler had lost his edge in my opinion. The storied became too bombastic and he gave Dirk that which can only be described as super-powers.<br /><br />This film made Pitt more real without losing the elements that make Pitt and Giordino such popular characters.<br /><br />The storyline was simplified from Cusslers original in my opinion the better for it.<br /><br />This is truly James Bond meets Indiana Jones.<br /><br />I will look forward to the next Pitt adventure with McConaughey and Zahn. Bravo Matt.
0380729407|4.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury is a very interesting book.  It is a fiction  <br />story about two boys and their adventures at a carnival.  If you like adventure and things that are out of this world, then you will like this book.  Jim and Will (the two main characters) are very different.  Will is very cautious and always thinks things through before doing them. Jim on the other hand just likes to go for things no matter what the consequences may be.  The two boys go to a carnival and witness wicked stuff happening there.  The book is pretty, long because of so many things that are happening at the carnival.  It is fifty-four chapters long.  If you are looking for something to read during your long, boring summer then read Something Wicked This Way Comes.  The adventure never ends in this surprising, fiction story. <br />
0385338686|4.0|I have read all of Kinsella's books and I have yet to be disappointed. In her newest book, she waves another tale of hilarious fiction that follow the lead female from the strict confines of a law office, were she isn't appreciated, to becoming a maid/cook at a wealthy house in the country. Kinsella's females characters are both realitically chamring and as bumbling as everyone is from time to time. Though the events in this book seem rather...unrealistic, she writes in such a way that makes even the biggest sceptic laugh out loud and fall in love with every character.<BR>If you are looking for a light but really good book, I highly suggest this one. You really won't be sorry.
0893860220|5.0|If you have come across this book whilst searching for books on advaita/non-duality, don't search any more. I would highly recommend that you buy this book now. It has simply become the Bible of the modern Advaita movement. I first came across it 30 years ago now, and for many years it was the only book I took with me on my travels. One of the beautiful things about Nisargadatta's approach is that it is not 'fixed'. In the very same chapter he can often be seen to make what, on the surface, may appear to be completely contradictory statements - supporting completely conflicting views. This is no accident, as a mind that is not 'fixed' is flexible enough to be able to fully appreciate opposing views. In the 'spiritual' search, the mind can often hook onto various views, positions, attitudes, beliefs, etc - not seeing that this is all simply a movement of the mind - not ultimately 'real'. Nisargadatta's approach (in 'I Am That', and indeed, his other works) is a multi-faceted one, and one of the clearest pointers to truth that has ever been written down. I cannot speak highly enough about this book ... however, it may be the last one you will need to buy as a 'seeker'! The good news is that even after that, you can still appreciate it as a masterpiece of modern literature! <br />Roy Whenary (author of 'The Texture Of Being')
B000AJJNOK|5.0|I don't have this version yet.  I will get it tommorrow, but the album is hot, regardless what the haters will tell you.  Target, Best Buy, and Circuit City all have it on sale for $11.99 this week.  Outta Control remix is great, thats the only new song on the album.  I've seen the Piggy Bank and Gatman and Robbin video, nothing special about the Gatman and Robbin video, but the Piggy Bank video is a great diss to all 50 enemies.  I highly recommend picking this up even if you have the original version like me.  GGGGGG-UNIT!!!!!!

1565115147|3.0|While Guns Germs and Steel has been made into an excellent television series, the audiobook version is severely lacking. A better narrator and better editing is sorely needed, which is a shame as the subject matter and content is A+.  In this case your better off with the series or wait for the DVD
B000000OSG|5.0|the definitive gnr album. the most melodic of them all and also the best. civil war, 14 years, yesterdays, knockin' on heaven's door (dylan's best cover), breakdown, pretty tied up, locomotive, so fine, estranged, you could be mine and a different version of don't cry in an album is something only uyi2 can give you. it is so freakin great. and even get in the ring (some kind of autobographical) and the fast-paced shotgun blues sound great inside this masterpiece collection. yes, my world is the worst gnr song of all time, but really, who cares?? do it like me and pretend the album finishes after don't cry. one stupid minute and half doesn't screw an hour of the greatest music of all time. Must have.

B0007LCNKM|5.0|I got a hold of an advance copy while walking around Greenwich, just about three weeks before it hit the stores, and I have to say it's one of the most solid albums I've ever heard. I liked \\"Sad Songs...\\" so much that I think it's one of the albums I've listened to the most in the past years, but in a few months \\"Alligator\\" has become a fine contender. It's mesmerizing, the melodies, the lyrics, the beat section... I could go on for hours praising this record... <br /> <br />After all, you get this feeling that this band is *your* best little secret. You'll feel compelled to share this with everybody you know. And then when they come back thanking you for the discovery, you'll quietly grin and think, \\"I knew it!\\" <br /> <br />This album has made me feel both the joy and the loneliness of being alive. It is a perfect postcard of these states of mind. It has great confidence boosts (even though some are completely ironic) as well as those intimate, dirty confessions that no one says that often anymore. No pose here, they're just honest, and they rock. And, most importantly, I believe them. <br /> <br />And I'm happy about that.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Mediocre horror film that not only has one of the worse stories ever written for a film of this nature but has some of the worse dialog as well. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence has promise but he lacks the professionalism to keep this movie from falling part from its own stupidity and he lacks the experience to put on a better show. Keanu Reeves is so miscast to point that it's almost painful to watch him on screen and the way he plays the character is so annoying that you just end up looking away from him because of his bad performance. They are much better actors in the film that do make lemonade out of lemons with Rachel Weisz making this movie bearable with her great and game performance and Peter Stormare, who gives way too much class to his small role which does far more for the film than Keanu and most of the cast combine.  <br /> <br />See the film for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare who do try their best with the bad material they both had to work with and they both almost succeed in making you forget how bad the movie really is. Other then their efforts though, this is still not a good movie and I suggest you wait for cable instead.  <br /> <br />
B00080ZG10|4.0|Clearly Martin Scorsese is able to bring out the best in his actors.  We all know Cate Blanchette and Alan Alda will bring their A-games to every film they are in.  But in this film, the performances are fantastic top-to-bottom.  Leonardo does a great job personifying Howard Hughes, even though he doesn't really look like him.  Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, and Ian Holm are given juicy parts to work with and pull them off with aplomb.  Even the bit parts with no interesting dialogue, such as Brent Spiner as the head of Lockheed, is utterly convincing and almost unrecognisable because everyone embodies the era and the part they are immersed in.  But most important (other than Leonardo himself) is the performance of Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow - when she steps up to the mike at the premier of Hell's Angels, you feel like you're looking at a 1930's movie star, not an the lead singer of an MTV-friendly rock band.  It is at that moment that you know that Scorsese has done it again and we're in for a fun and exciting ride. <br /> <br />The story: Howard Hughes inherits the family fortune, made from manufacturing drill-bits for oil rigs, and arrives in Hollywood to make a WWI epic.  He buys some 80 biplanes and sets out to film the most spectacular aerial footage ever seen in a film.  4 million dollars later (which was a lot of money in the 30's!) he releases the film to much fanfare while simultaneously working to purchase a controlling interest in TWA airlines.  Hughes knows the potential for aviation and sets out making prototypes for military planes, test flying them himself.  In the film's most spectacular sequence, his double-rotored spy plane loses an engine and crashes into a Beverly Hills neighbourhood - this is the most harrowing representation of a plane crash since \\"Alive.\\"  Hughes then starts to succumb to mental illness - obsessive-compulsive disorder - which is admirably performed by DiCaprio.  When he dares to challenge Pan Am's virtual monopoly, the CEO of Pan Am has his tame Senator (Alan Alda) haul Hughes into a congressional hearing accusing him of war profiteering.  In the film's two most enjoyable sequences, Alda and DiCaprio spar first over dinner at the Senator's apartment (the Senator getting the upper hand) and then again at the hearings (this time with Hughes scoring a K.O. on the corrupt senator).   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, while the model work is very well done, the computer-animated material is a little hokey and distracting from the realism of the performances.  It's ironic that the footage for Hell's Angels (the WWI pic) is animated when Hughes himself was going for realism in the film.  The film also suffers from overproduction in parts.  As he often does, Scorsese errs on the side of big - too many extras, too rich colour, too big sets.  Hughes is bigger than life, but sometimes this films seems to go a little over-the-top. <br /> <br />The DVD is full of extras, as you'd expect from an epic picture like this.  There are a couple documentaries (one produced by the History Channel) on the life of Hughes the Aviator.  There is also a discussion/interview with an expert on obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Curiously, there is no extra feature on Hughes's movies.  Other featurettes on aspects of the filming - on the effects, makeup, wardrobe, etc. - are good, although much of the information is repeated in the audio commentary.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|I just came back from a trip to the USA where to my absolute delight I happened to see 'Guilty' on a music stand. Although I had already placed my order with Amazon for 'Guilty Pleasures' I had no idea that the original was to be reissued. I could not wait to get home and so I played it en route on my car CD player. It still sounded amazing and brought back such happy memories. I was only 17 years old when I first heard this album and was introduced to Barbra by a guy I was dating at the time. The relationship lasted only a few months but my affair with Barbra has lasted and gotten stronger as the years have passed. I still think that every album and every movie are events and always look forward to the next with eager anticipation. This album sounds as great now as it did all those years ago although I think that the DVD footage could have included a more in depth interview and less cheesy back slapping. That said, it was great to see the 'One Voice' duets and the teaser for the 'Guilty Pleasures' release that is set for Sept 20th 2005.  Great marketing and as always GREAT BARBRA.

Musician and \\"man/woman-in-the-street\\" interviews are interwoven with concert performances, all of it presented in the then-ground-breaking format of multiple on-screen images.

B0006HC0I2|5.0|Jacques Becker's tight, intelligent thriller out-noirs most American entries. The magnetic presence of Gabin, France's answer to Tracy and Bogart, helps immeasurably. Gabin's Max is tough as they come, but also shows a human side in his unwavering loyalty to careless pal Riton. Becker keeps the yarn unraveling at a brisk pace, as Max's long-awaited retirement remains suspended in mid-air. Eye catching Paris locale adds flavor to this juicy crime classic.
1567184855|5.0|The best book I've ever read regarding reincarnation, past lives or where we go between lives.  This is my favorite \\"gift\\" to give to anyone.  Dr.  Newton shares his case studies with us in a very understandable format that makes the reader not want to put the book down.
B00005ASGG|5.0|John Ford's last great moment came with \\"Liberty Valance,\\" a film largely panned on release, when the director's romanticized vision of the Old West seemed outmoded. The film's resurgent popularity comes from dynamic star performances and a seminal western story: the railroad's influence in transforming the rule of the gun (represented by Valance and Doniphon) to the rule of law (represented by Stoddard). A touching and insightful portrait of the passing of an age, and a tribute to the western genre itself.  A clever suprise caps this film.
B000003TAR|4.0|I think I'm one of the very few diehards that believes 'In Utero' was not Nirvanas best studio album. Now dont get me wrong, it is far from a bad album, justifying the four star rating, but there are many crudentials lacking of 'In Utero' that aren't as lacking on 'Bleach'. However, some of Nirvanas best and most beautiful songs can be found here; songs like 'Heart Shaped Box', with its depressing lyrics about Kurts heroine addiction and his misfortune that befell him soon after he was hooked, \\"forever in debt to your priceless advise\\" lets us know that Cobain would much rather have chosen a drug-free path. 'Rape Me' was Kurts anti-Teen Spirit. It is a song about how SLTS \\"raped\\" Nirvana of their undergroung status and turned them into alternative heroes. \\"Rape me my friend\\" describes how Kurt almost felt betrayed, because, as most Nirvana fans know, he loved SLTS when he made it, but then after it made him famous its almost as if he despised it. 'Dumb' is a soft ballad and is about the feelings you have when you're high with lyrics like \\"I think I'm dumb\\" and \\"We'll float aroung, hang out on clouds\\". 'All Apologies' is another ballad, but unlike 'Dumb' it is loud at times. It is a ballad to his wife Courtney Love (who has since ruined Cobains great legacy) and infant daughter Francis Bean, and how he felt like everything that happened to them was his fault. 'Serve the Servants', the opener to the album, is a great rocker that explains the high price of fame. And 'Very Ape' is a bit different, but it has one hell of a catchy riff. As usual Dave Grohl is top knotch, but I do think Novoselic did better on previous albums, I dont know.<br /><br />  The other half of 'In Utero' however, isn't so great. 'Scentless Apprentice' sounds too much like 'Aneurysm', with its its rising riff. 'Milk It' can often times sound pointless, and although the riff is good, it just doesn't make up for what the song lacks. 'Pennyroyal Tea' lacks the insightful lyrics of previous ballads, and although isn't bad, it just doesn't meet my expectations. 'Tourrettes' is just dumb. I know Cobain was originally influenced by punk, but its nothing when compared to other punk driven songs like 'Territorial Pissings' and 'Aneurysm'. 'Francis Farmer...' and 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' arent bad, butthey get boring after a while. And also Cobain may sound like he's being coninuously shot in the leg with his banshee screaming. But most of the time he sounds alright.<br /><br />  So, while there may seem to be a lot of things wrong with this, it is overall a 4 star, thanks to classic songs like 'Heart-shaped Box', 'Rape me', and 'All Apologies'. I think any grunge fan should own this, oh, and pick up 'Bleach' too, its Nirvanas best.
B00003CXB2|5.0|\\"Lawrence\\" is visually astounding, with panoramic desert vistas and jaw-dropping battle scenes. Beyond the epic elements, legendary director, David Lean snatched the promising newcomer Peter O'Toole to star as the desert dwelling Brit.  Lean surrounds the young actor with a top cast  including Omar Sharif (in his first English-speaking picture), Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and Jose Ferrer. But O'Toole, handsome and assured in the lead, carries the film, conveying the essential mystery of this heroic figure.

Shot in Technicolor on location in Japan, the film is gorgeous to look at, and Brando's work is skillfully nuanced, as his character's outlook gradually evolves from intolerance to enlightenment through the love of a woman. Red Buttons, playing Brando's best friend, and Miyoshi Umeki as his lover won Oscars for their touching, heartfelt performances as the doomed couple.
0380729407|4.0|This book, Something Wicked This Way Comes is a book by Ray Bradbury.  It is a fiction book. In this book, the lesson is to help others in any way you can.  It is like what John F. Kennedy said, \\"Ask not what the country can do for you, but what you can do for the country.\\" In this case, Will helped his friend without asking and that shows how much Will and his friend Jim care about each other. This book has a lot to do with friendship. <br /> The text is about a carnival coming to their town late in the year and Will's father has a bad feeling about it but the boys are enthusiastic about it and go many different times. Mr. Dark, the illustrator, has like an evil mind while Charles Halloway, Will's father, doesn't. Mr. Halloway outsmarts Mr. Dark, rescues his son, and kills the witch.  Later, Jim falls into a stupor where he almost dies.  Mr. Dark comes back as a kid when Mr. Halloway had recognized him and kills him with showing affection.  While the carnival falls apart, Will keeps trying to revive Jim.  Will and his father save him by singing, dancing, and laughing, anything that deals with happiness.  Happiness brings Jim back alive and away from the edge of being dead. <br /> At the beginning of the book, it was very interesting learning about the two boys of how they were and described themselves.  For me, later, it got less interesting, but then Mr. Dark came in with the carnival and everything all of a sudden was very cool to keep reading. <br /> Therefore, this book has to do a lot with happiness and heroic stuff.  I hope this convinces you that Something Wicked This Way Comes is very interesting and fun to read. <br />
B00079ZACM|5.0|A pounding adventure shot in saturated Technicolor, superbly directed by Zoltan Korda (brother of Alexander, the film's producer), \\"Feathers\\" is top-notch entertainment based on A.E.W. Mason's classic novel. Clements is solid in the lead, but top acting laurels go to Ralph Richardson in a rare screen turn as Clements' friend and romantic rival, along with the incomparable C. Aubrey Smith as a crusty war horse. The scenes where Smith recounts his past glories in battle are peerless.
B00008ADPF|3.0|The main knock on Nickelback has always been that they use the same chords and riffs as well as lyric content. Sure, there's the saying that \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it' but there's also the economic law of diminishing returns. Putting out the same basic product every 2 years is only going to work for die hard fans. This CD is perfect for Nickelback fans looking for the encore to Silver Side Up. There's tons of catchy vocal hooks like Chad is known for and even if you find it hard to like Nickelback you have to admit their catchy. The CD's main single, 'Someday', is excellent even if it was overplayed.  <br /> <br />They do have some different type of songs but as I've said before, the lyric content about bad relationships or someone losing hope are the same. The last three songs are covers from various bands as well. The album is a solid album but it can get boring or redundant. The real treat, as always, is the vocals. Nickelback fans need to buy this but iffy fans need to go to Silver Side Up.
0694524786|5.0|This c.d. was a complete life saver on our summer driving/camping holiday.  Our six year old son was completely enraptured by the characters and the plot.  There were moral lessons to learn but of course fabulous evil characters, good guys and battle scenes as well.  The narrator, Michael York, did a great job of giving each character a unique voice.  When we paused in our listening we had plenty of fodder for some unique discussions.  Infact this c.d. stood up to two rounds of listening over a two week driving trip.
B00005T7I6|5.0|When Tim Burton released \\"Batman\\" in 1989, producers at major movie studios were scouring for a film based on a comic strip character that would cash in on the success of that previous movie. In 1990, Warren Beaty produced, directed and starred in \\"Dick Tracy\\", a movie based on the popular 1930's detective series. Surrounding himself with some great setpieces and a barrage of well known names, \\"Dick Tracy\\" was released to a somewhat underwhelming response. However, 15 years later, the film has aged remarkably well.<br /><br />Before I go any further, just let me state one thing. This film is campy. Extremely campy. However, this is one of those cases where camp actually works. The hideous makeup worn by the villians of the movie may have seemed rediculous then, but now, however, they seem almost funny. And they were indeed rather creative, as it won an Oscar. Seeing a bevy of famous faces buried beneath the layers of goo smattered upon them only adds to the enjoyment.<br /><br />The film's plot? Well, to be honest, there's no actual plot, so to speak. Dick Tracy (Warren Beaty) is the top detective in town (never caught the name), and he's out to take down the top crime boss in town, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino). That's pretty much it. There's no elaborate scheme, no heist or anything like that. A wide variety of colorful characters pop up throughout the movie, such as blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney (a surprisingly convincing Madonna), Dick's gal Tess Truehart (Glenn Headly), The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), dull witted mobster Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman) and a host of others. But the film never really developes an actual plotline. And that's the film's charm.<br /><br />The cast assembled for this film stands as one of the greatest ensembles ever assembled for one movie. Beatty leads a cast that includes, in addition to cast members I already mentioned, Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates, Dick Van Dyke, Mandy Patankin, Charles Durning, Henry Silva, Catherine O'Hara, and William Forsythe. The real star of the show, however, is Al Pacino. Like Jack Nicholson when he played The Joker, Pacino absolutely steals the movie, chewing the scenery like a piece of gum and enjoying every minute of it as he gets a chance to lampoon pretty much every role he's ever done. It's no surprise he got a Best Supporting Actor nomination from the Academy that year.<br /><br />The songs by Steven Sondheim are fantastic, including the Oscar winning \\"Sooner Or Later (I Always Get My Man)\\", sung with sultry flair by the material girl herself. The set design made the comics leap off the pages and come alive (the film used the same main coors from the comics). \\"Dick Tracy\\" may not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth owning.ara, and William Forsythe.

B000002MIB|4.0|In 1991, Van Halen released the album \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\". This album got a surprsingly good reception from both critics and longtime fans of the group, who initally dismissed the Sammy Hagar-led VH as a formulaic ballad machine. To celebrate this newfound exceptance, the band launched a massive world tour. The result was the two disc live album \\"Live: Right Here, Right Now\\", containing 24 tracks from the tour. How is this live album? Here are the highlights and the low points.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />The majority of the album is really great. Sammy's vocal are in top condition, Eddie plays like a madman, and the rest of the band delivers. The performances are energetic and full of life, from the opening \\"Poundcake\\" to the closing \\"Top Of The World\\". They stake a great stab at The Who's classic \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", and Alex shows his talents on the drums with the nine minute \\"Pleasure Dome/Drum Solo\\". Forced to pick a highlight, though I'd go for Eddie's 11 minute instrumental \\"316\\", which also manages to incorporate \\"Eruption\\" at the end.<br /><br />Lowlights:<br />The reason I don't give this collection five stars is for the performances of the David Lee Roth songs. Sammy actually manages to pull of \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\" and \\"Jump\\" pretty well, but it's \\"Panama\\" that doesn't work. It starts off well enough, but then Sammy launches into this whole foul mouthed dialouge about tomorrow and stuff. It's somewhat amusing and a little uplifting, but overall unneccessary. Also, I think they leaned a little too heavily on the \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" tracks. They perform pretty much the whole album. I would've had them do just \\"Right Now\\", \\"Poundcake\\", \\"316\\", \\"Runaround\\" and \\"Top Of The World\\" and then do some more stuff \\"5150\\" and \\"OU812\\" and maybe some more Roth stuff.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great live album. With some changes, it would have been perfect.
0439679958|2.0|The names of characters and places have changed a little, but Raven's Gate is definitely the Devil's Door-bell. I feel foolish for having bought this book when I already read Devil's Door-bell. I didn't realize this was going to be the same book. This is a case of an author cashing in on his current popularity to try and make money on his older books. Books that did not sell well... and for good reason. This book is not up to the standards of his Alex Rider series.
B00000JPH6|4.0|I love Jim Henson's work so I may just be partial. Though times have changed and special affects have improved I still see the Dark Crystal as a work of art. For when it was made it was ahead of its time...It's a classic and I don't think anyone would regret having it to enjoy once in a while
B00000K3CR|5.0|One of my family's favorite movies of all time. We have literally worn out our VHS copy so needed to replace it.
B00003CXDD|4.0|Willow is a good family movie. Val Kilmer is great with his subtle remarks.Its funny, action pact, and simply enjoyable. Its a movie you will want to see now and again. I gave it 4 stars b/c the story is good but the acting isn't so great.

0380729407|4.0|Something Wicked this way comes is written by Ray Bradbury.  This book is all about a mystery.  The mystery starts with this weird and creepy man.  Jim and Will are the two main characters in the story.  They are introduced to this shadowy man early in the book.  This man puts a spell on the two boys.  Many things are happening to the boys all through out the story.  At certain parts of the book, they are chased by a storm.  This storm continues to bring many bad things to the boys.  There was a special day for Jim's dad; he could not wait until his son had come home.  However, the surprise that he was expecting was not what Jim had brought to him.  Jim and Will had been arrested by the police.  They would not tell His father where they were.  At that point, of the story, I thought to my self, \\"What could the father be thinking of his son?\\"  At that point, I could only feel sorrow for how he felt.  This story goes on to more details and to more problems to the two boys.  The story ends in a surprising ending.  For more details on the book, you have to get it and read it.

0613325419|4.0|Very cute and for a good cause.  More information on magical creatures found in the books.  Worth the short read.
B00092ZL80|5.0|There's not too much I can add to the stellar reviews of this DVD.  All I can say is that you can play this for any kid and they'll be begging you to let them join the band.  A great party DVD especially if there are musicians around although anyone will enjoy it.   Outstanding sound from two of my all-time favorite groups! <br /> <br />Also, check out both lead singers recent solo albums: \\"Soul on Jazz\\" by Philip Bailey and \\"Subtlety & Passion\\" by Robert Lamm.  Bailey creates a mellow CD and  Lamm's CD is especially superb featuring most of the members of Chicago with horns on ALL the cuts, great writing and Lamm's magical voice.  A better-than-Chicago delight!
B000002504|5.0|I'll be honest.  The main reason I purchased \\"Octopus\\" the other day was that I remembered seeing the cover in \\"The Album Cover Album\\" some 20 years ago when I was in high school (at least I think that's where I saw it).  I've liked progressive rock like Yes and King Crimson and even newer groups like Coheed and Cambria, but I had never gotten around to Gentle Giant.  What a great surprise, then, when I listened to the music itself.  Fantastic, complex, invigorating: Gentle Giant clearly has a unique sound.  The other reviewers who note that they are an \\"acquired taste\\" are right.  In fact, for the first listen or two, I was not quite sure what to make of it.  After that, though, I was drawn in, particularly when listening on headphones, allowing me to catch the subtly nuanced interplay of instruments and voices.  I highly recommend this for any progressive rock fan.  Each song is unique, but \\"The Advent of Panurge,\\" \\"Think of Me with Kindess,\\" and \\"The River\\" are standouts to me.  I now plan to work my way through the entire Gentle Giant catalogue.

0385336810|5.0|I listened to this book on Audio during a drive home between Ohio and Illinois.  Unfortunately the drive is only 3 1/2 hours long, so I stayed up until 1:30am to hear the rest of Emma and Jack's story.  I couldn't go to sleep until I found out how it ended.  This is such a \\"gripping\\" story and I just love Emma, I can see so much of her in me and her roomates in my friends.  This is the first Sophie Kinsella book I purchased but I have a feeling I am now a addicted to her characters.  Now, I wonder if there are any Jack's that are attainable in real life ?
B000957O82|4.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies! They could have made it a bit shorter, but... oh well! This movie was an absolutely funny comedy! Only fault is that there was that scene with the food allergies, it just didn't make sense, and was boring. meh... four stars!
0679737456|3.0|The book Black Ice was written by Lorene Cary. The book is an autobiography, and most of the book is about the author's experiences at St. Paul's Boarding School. Some of it is about her experiences outside of the school. St. Paul's changed Lorene's life. Black Ice has a lot of drama in all of the chapters. The author moves from Yeadon High School in Philadelphia to St. Paul's Boarding School in New Hampshire. Lorene thinks she can walk into the school and expect to get all A's, but she finds out just how challenging St.Paul's. She finds this out by failing calculus which is a two- year course, and she couldn't take the pressure. She failed both years of the course. Lorene had a tutor that was catching her up in class, but she still far behind in calculus. Lorene passed all of her other classes except calculus. Lorene also learned to always watch your back. She was a waitress at a restaurant which the cooks played pranks on the waitresses like switching the orders and undercooking the food. The cooks were mean to her at the restaurant. Lorene asked one of the cooks to get her some sticks of butter, and the cook says no. Lorene goes into the freezer herself to get butter, and the same cook follows her into the freezer. He locks the freezer door with both of them inside. Lorene threatens the cook she will scream if he doesn't let her out of the freezer. The cook holds her arms with one of his hands, and he takes his other hand and drags it down her whole body. The cook unlocks the freezer door, and he lets Lorene go. Lorene tells the owner of the restaurant about the incident the next day, and the cook was fired.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is one of metallica's best albums, and sadly the last great album they released :(  Oh, and I've finally decided which one is Metallica's best, and it is Ride the Lightning although this one is very closed to be.  And here we also have a comeback from Kirk Hammett (that was good at MOP, but not as he was at RTL). And Lars was excellent here, if he could continue like this he could be good as Dave Lambardo. But when they turned to a mainstream band Lars' talents weren't required and he got worse, and now we see the results, the drumming on St Anger is one of the worst has ever been performed (and also he turned to a complete idiot). Oh, and James' voice got only better. The only weak point is the production, so far it has the poorest production on a Metallica album (aside of St Anger), that removed the  bass, although its not that bad (if you want a metal album with a really BAD production go for Sepultura's 'Morbid Visions', Slayer's 'Hell Awaits' or Priest's 'Rocka Rolla'). Jason is actually a good bass player, not as good as the great Cliff (RIP) that was probably the 3rd best bassist in heavy metal after Geezer Butler and Steve Harris. Still Jason has great performance in The Black Album.  My favorite are 'Blackened', the title track (don't get shocked of that it is 10 minutes), 'Dyers Eve', and the best song here 'One', which talkes about a soldier who lost in a battle and now he's imprisoned and very poor, I love the part when James screams 'Darkness imprisoning me...\\", the doublebass sounds like a machine gun and the video was also great, I also think that 'Ride the Lightning' (song) was incredible, and I can't decide which one was the best! They both rock!!!  PS another Must Have album, but I still prefer Ride the Lightning to this. But I like this more than Puppets...
B00004WKII|5.0|I always conidered myself a casual Hendrix fan-- however, in spite of what other reviewers have written this collection absolutely blows this casual fan away.  This set of songs contains incredible versions of songs you thought you knew well, as well as many interesting, lesser known songs that were subsequently released posthumously.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Incredible comeback. After 4 poor (relatively) albums that let us down, they release another masterpiece, with Adrian that quitted in 1990 and Bruce that left at the late 1993. Now don't get me wrong, I actually liked Fear of the Dark and also kinda X factor. And finally they got rid off this Blaze, who wasn't baf but didn't suite the band (check out his solo effort Sillicon Messiah which BTW also got out in 2000). Now with 3 guitarists they destroy almost everthing is out now. While this is not Maiden's very best, a top 5 album and IMO their best since Powerslave (1984).   This is how I rate the songs:    The Wickerman (15/10): Best song on the album. The biggest hit off it and best album opener since 'Aces High'. Great groove, solos and vocals.    Ghost of the Navigator (10/10): Amazing intro. Kinda progressive song, also great chorus.    Brave New World (9/10): A great title track, great melody, kinda repetitive chorus. Great but IMO not par on other title tracks like Killers, NOTB, Powerslave, Seventh Son, FOTD and Dance of Death but all those are classics.    Blood Brothers (10/10): Amazing ballad. It was dedicated for Steve's father who passed away during the bands tour. Awesome intro.    The Mercenary (7.5/10): Repetetive, decent verse, awesome chorus. Go figure....    Dream of Mirrors (9/10): The first epic and thelongest song on the album. Although it kinda drags out in the end it's still great nontheless.    The Fallen Angel (10/10): Very underrated, awesome from the beginning to the end and is also the heaviest song on the album.    Nomad (10/10): Fans of 'To Tame a Land' and 'Powerslave' (title track) would probably love this song, it's great middle-eastern-esque epic with awesome interlude. F**king awesome solos and Bruce really shines here. Aside from The Wickerman this is my favorite song here.    Out of the Silent Planet (5/10): Average... Never really got into this one. Very annoying and repetetive song.    The Thin Line Between Love And Hate (8/10): A good album closer. It's the 3rd epic song off the album, however I didn't really like it at the first time.    Too bad they are not energetic like in the early 80's when they were releasing constantly albums. Although now they released a live album 'Death on the Road' and another hits collection (that is better than the previous collections but generally it sucks) and two years ago another studio album.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Top Gun is one of those power movies that most guys just kind of thirst for - fast action, hot chick, tragedy, overcoming odds, etc.  A lot of work went into making Top Gun truly one of the most realistic fighter plane movies ever.  It was made back in the early 1980's before computer graphics came out, so virtually all the footage of jet planes is real and the situations are realistic, as the Navy had a heavy hand in determining the way the Top Gun school was taught and how the planes flew.  Of course, you also have great '80s sunglasses, hairdos and outfits with a dynamite cast of Tom Cruise, Meg Ryan, Val Kilmer, and Kelly McGillis lighting things up.  Past that, you've got a seriously power-charged soundtrack that not only has some classic '80s hits, but truly captures the spirit and flare of the film.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|This album isn't really necessary to buy, because if you already have Hot Fuss you can get the other three tracks on iTunes. (I went and got it the day it came out because I'm a fanatic.) First of all, the whole album is excellent. They had to do something to tide us over, because their sophomore disc isn't due out until next spring. (!!) Indie R&R is a more open sounding track, in my opinion, and so is Michael Valentine. They don't really fit with the rest of the cd, but are of course still awesome. Under The Gun, however, could be the next Mr. Brightside. I think it should have been on there to begin with. It's probably my favorite on the album. <br />So I do love The Killers, but I think they could have given us a little bit more material. Maybe even a second disk, with like the videos and rarer b-sides.
6305537321|4.0|Although by far not her best performance ever, Audrey Hepburn does do an amazing bit of acting of someone who just can't make up her mind about how she feels.  A classic chic-flick about a mis-understood girl just bubbling over with emotion and unsure of what to do about it.  Although the plot is somewhat thin and confusing at times, and the ending leaves you wondering how they got there, the ending is one of those sweet true-love moments that can really bust you up.  I felt kind of sorry for the cat, and it seemed to have a rather central role in much of the action.  Still, it earns a 4 star rating as being a classic film with some really good acting at times and some truly beautiful music that leaves you rather moved.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had read little bits about this series, and investigated the DVD set, but never did anything until I saw the first half of \\"Serenity\\" on the SciFi channel. Unbelievable! Waited patiently for Part 2,  but also bought the DVD series, and watched it all in two days, and am ready to start over. The cast, and thier development far exceeds what I always liked about Star Trek, still a great ground breaker, but I felt it much easier to relate to the crew of the Serenity. Can't wait for the movie! I have never watched an episode of Joss Whedon's other series, but after Firefly, I may take a look.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|Ok, the graphics were kool and very retro which is why I got the DVD in the first place.  But come on, the acting was like - well the actors sent in their virtual representations.  Maybe blue screen acting is just to hard for some people. The acting from this movie reminded me of acting scenes from a rather famous video game series that another movie flop was later made from.  I did appreciate the graphics and all the efforts that went into making those from the geek part of my brain.  But there was just no human interest to the actors' parts.  The extras disc was probably more interesting than the actual movie when it comes right down to it.
B0000041LO|1.0|Bad recording - all one can hear is the piano part...too loud and is sounded liked the piano was set right next to the microphone... Wish I could return this set of CD's. Very disappointed.
B00005JNQA|3.0|Nicole Kidman (Dogville, The Hours, To Die For) plays Sylvia Broome, an Interpreter for the U.N. who over heard something up in the booth that she works in that may have been an assassination on the president of Matobo, Zubwanie. So, secret service agent Tobin Keller, played by Sean Penn (Mystic River, The Assassination Of Richard Nixon), whos wife just recently died, is on the verge of believing her and not. Nicely constructed action/thriller with some pretty good moments, one being a bus conversation and then it explodes. Also starring Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Full Frontal), Jesper Christopher and Michael Wright (Money Talks, Pinero). Probably one of the only good movies that has come out so far besides Sin City and Crash.
B00006L7XQ|3.0|Other than a wonderfully awesome rendition of \\"Hurt,\\" I think the rest of the album is a laugh a minute.  I never laughed so hard in my life as when I heard \\"Personal Jesus.\\"  If Depeche Mode were dead, they would be rolling over in their collective grave!  His voice quivers at times , and goes off key (usually flat)when you're least expecting it.   I know a lot of people out there think Johnny Cash is the fourth member of the Holy Trinity, but offkey is offkey, regardless of how many years you've been turning out great product.       In My Life and First Time Ever I Saw your Face are also real sidesplitters.       I loaded this into my MP3 player for those moments I become depressed and need a good laugh. Worth buying for the comedic effect.    This is not to say I have no respect for his achievements.  It would have been better if he had stuck with the type of country music that he was so wonderful at interpreting.
0380729407|4.0|<br />Something Wicked This Way Comes   is a horror, narrative, and mystery type novel. I say that it is a mystery type of story because it gives clues in the beginning of the book.  As the characters receive the clues, they lead up to even bigger events inside the book later on. The three main characters in this novel are two boys and their father. In the story, one of the boys is the narrator of this book so that is why it is also narrative.  This book is a fictional type of story.  <br />This book begins with a sales man talking to both of the kids. The sells man tries to convince the kids to buy a product for the roof. Just like in many movies, something seems wrong to the characters.  In this particular case, it is about a thunderstorm and it will burn their house roof.  Sure enough, one of the kids believes him and buys the product from him.  As they go up to install it on the roof, they catch a whiff of something burning in the air.

0553296981|5.0|I have to admit that when I first read this book, maybe about five years ago, I thought it was probably the most boring book ever. Language probably had something to do with it, as I read it in a language I'm not truly comfortable reading in. Now, after re-reading it, I've realized what a wonderful classic this book is - not only it describes a young Jew's life during the Holocaust (in an extraordinary situation) but also it tells about the most intimate feelings a person can feel. Sometimes I even feel guilty that so many people got to read Anne's deepest thoughts, for I'm sure this was never meant to come out to the public.<br /><br />Are readers likely to like Anne after reading the book? Of course not! If people had access to my deepest, darkest secrets, I'd probably be a very hate-able person. In fact, I think it was disgusting how Anne talked about her mother and how selfish she was sometimes. But you have to remind yourselves, however, that Anne was just 13-15 and was suffering like none of us ever have. She was just a teenager, growing and struggling to find her true self!<br /><br />Another interesting thing is how good of a writer Anne was at such a young age. It's sad to think about all those \\"what she could've been.\\" At least a few of her writings came out to the open, somehow, but it's not the same.<br /><br />This diary will not only offer very interesting accounts of a \\"life in hiding,\\" but also some very philosophical questions and ideas. Obviously, Anne was a pretty smart girl...she was just very hard to understand, like any other girl her age will be.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone for it's a very important classic to read. If you haven't read it, you're truly missing out on something that will definitely teach a lesson to humanity.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|If you like Nirvana, you will love this CD!  One of the few CD's I have purchased this year where almost all of the songs are great to listen to.  Although I liked the songs on side one better than side two, side two does have a lot to offer, including Miracle.  If you are tired of buying CD's that only have one or two good songs on them, then it is time you bought this CD, you will be glad you did!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is no doubt the most amazing, shocking, heartbreaking, honest, and gruesome Holocaust movie ever made, even more so than The Pianist. It's so graphic and realistic it'll make your stomach turn. You get so absorbed into the whole story that you actually feel as if you were there. <br /> <br />Oscar Schindler does not exactly fit your average description of a hero. He often got drunk, womanized, cheated on his wife, and barely seemed to have a heart. And, of course, he belonged to the Nazi party.  <br /> <br />Who would've known that he would willingly save the lives of 1200 Jews? Apparently, heroism comes in all shapes and forms.  <br /> <br />Steven Spielberg truly deserves all the praise (and even more than that!) that he got for creating this film. Other than the story, which was, of course, incredibly interesting, beautiful and ugly at the same time, the special effects were truly incredible, starting with the famous red dress. When I saw that little girl \\"in the red dress\\" had died, I broke down in tears, even if she never was a main character in the whole plot.  <br /> <br />I thought the ending was truly fantastic. I loved it how they showed all the \\"Schindler Jews\\" visiting Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. That was very beautiful.  <br /> <br />Thanks, Spielberg, for showing the world just how amazing this man called Oscar Schindler was.
0679737456|3.0|The author of Black Ice is Lorene Cary.  This book is mostly about racism, and a young girl named Lorene being highly educated] and working with whites in a restaurant.  I think anybody older than twelve and up will enjoy this text; Black Ice was mostly talking about Lorene's childhood.  <br />This book was quiet interesting.  In order to see if a book is going to be good, read the reference page. If its interesting then read the first page.  If you not, ask for assistance. <br />This novel will be a good book for fifth graders.  It will help them know more about the past between blacks, and whites. It will help increase your vocabulary, and give you more history out of the story. By a chance, you will probably enjoy reading Lorene Cary's autobiography of her childhood life. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00001U0DP|4.0|I should be giving this film more than four stars, but at the same time, I feel like I should not. A year ago, I would've no doubt awarded this movie a perfect five star rating. However, I've now taken other things into consideration. <br /> <br />First off, I'd like to say that this is a truly magical film, and I have no idea how the producers managed to do it. It's so ugly, but at the same time, so beautiful. The whole time you're watching, you're crying, but also smiling at the same time.  <br /> <br />La Vita E Bella [Life is Beautiful] is the story about a young, secular Jewish family in Italy during the Holocaust. It tells about the love of a father to his child. The father risks everything he's got - his life - to make his and his son's stay at a concentration camp a tad bit more bearable by pretending everything is just a game. He is a hilarious character. <br /> <br />I have a few problems with this movie, though. For one thing, it's incredibly historically inaccurate, but that doesn't really bother me that much, because the main point of the film does get across. My main concern with the movie, though, is how real Holocaust survivors actually feel about it. Unfortunately, most seem to think it's mocking them. They believe the movie makes everything that happened seem trivial and not as bad as it truly was. I hate to admit it, but, in a way, they are partially correct.  <br /> <br />Life is Beautiful does make the Holocaust become fiction, but, at the same time, it's simply a masterpiece. I've found it extremely hard to make up my mind about this movie. However, if you've never watched it - and you can clearly separate truth from fiction - this movie is simply a must-see.
