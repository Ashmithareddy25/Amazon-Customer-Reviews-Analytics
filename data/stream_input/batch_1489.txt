B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and challanging I find myself deeply intrested in it but however I would not suggest. this to a quikly angered/frustrated person becouse it somtimes makes me angry trying to complete the difficult games
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I did not enjoy this third book as much as the first two.  There was too much referring to the previous books events, and more detail about local landmarks than I felt were necessary.  Still, it was entertaining.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a really good app. This is the only Bible I use now since it has all of the various versions and translations. I'd recommend this Bible hands down.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Every aspect of this movie entertained on a positive level!  Humor, action, a touch of pathos, beautiful people (even the villains!) and overall fun.  I've seen it 3 times, possibly will see once more before it leaves the theaters.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!! It combines all the great elements of a runner and an adventure game! Everyone should download it!
B00007GZZK|5.0|I love this movie!!  I have a client who wanted to share this movie with his nieces and nephews and couldn't find it anywhere.  I got on my computer and within minutes ordered a copy for him to share.  These children were thrilled and loved the movie!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Many people have compared this to Fifty Shades of Grey and I can see why. There are a lot of similarities, but there are also wonderful differences, too. I really loved Gideon and Eva. I was cheering these two people with an abusive pasts on throughout the book.  There's great chemistry between them. The book is HOT, and I can't wait to read the next installment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|everything you need in a Bible...easy acess...easy reference...easy reading...best of all it's free like the word of God should be and intended :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not ashamed to admit it---this series hooked me from the start and I read all three books one after another. I couldn't get enough of Christian Grey. Although Ana became a tad annoying in book two, I still couldn't put it down until I knew what would become of these two characters. Some have said the writing is juvenile. I thought it was decent and many lines were funny, especially inner goddess thing. I'd recommend this series!!
B007NZDES0|5.0|HAVEN'T EVEN RECEIVED BRING ME HOME YET, BUT I JUST KNOW THAT IT IS GOING TO BE ON THE MONEY. SADE IS MY GURRL. LOVE HER. SADE IS FOREVER.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|A thrilling sequel to the first book in the series, I can't get enough of Lisbeth Salander. What a character - I feel I know her personally - long live the strong at heart!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The first three books of the Wool omnibus are as impressive as Frank Herbert's 45 year old Dune. Like Dune, Wool seems to have an intriguing story line, well developed characters and a high writing standard.<br /><br />However, books four and five fail to live up to the initial standard. The story stagnates, the writing deteriorates and cliff-hanger scenes don't progress the story. Characters became cruder mouthing more expletives. It is as if a different author had written these books.<br /><br />The whole business of the uprising seems illogical, there is no clear explanation of why, just a lot of frustratingly doomed actions.  Given that there had been uprisings in the past and in other silos, a better understanding of how and why they came about is needed.<br /><br />The lack of an elevator is incongruous but the stairwell is central to the story as well as to the silo. Technical errors such as transmitting radio waves through water and stairwell emergency lights operating without external power for 30 years add to the implausibility.<br /><br />IT is the villainous department that rules the silo at the same time giving themselves luxuries they deny others. But apart from keeping records and spying on people, the reason for having a large number of power hungry servers together with support staff is not explained.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Wool is a significant work and leaves open scope for further books in the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|5 stars, for sure. Awesome but very addictive. Your ego will get hurt when your kid surpasses your score. I am warning you all.
0545140323|4.0|First off, I love the cover of this book! It's so cute, using the Beatles theme and giving it a feminine twist - fits the book perfectly!<br /><br />Penny is a great MC. She's funny, endearing, and just plain easy to like. I could easily relate to her, and I just loved her voice. I admit there were a few times Penny's cluelessness and seeming incapability of just being happy irritated me, but overall, I loved her as our main character. I loved the rest of the girls in the Lonely Hearts Club, too, and I like how each of them has their own story - I would have liked to know even more about all these girls!<br /><br />And Ryan. Ryan is just so adorable! I loved Ryan. He's not the best, most complex character ever, but he's just so cute, and Ryan and Penny are adorable together. Their cluelessness frustrated me a little, but it was also kind of endearing. And necessary, since there wouldn't be much of a plot without all the drama.<br /><br />The Beatles references are fun, too. I don't know all that much about the Beatles because I'm too young, I guess, but I still liked that aspect of the story. Penny's parents are totally obsessed with the Beatles, causing for some very funny moments. Parts of it are a little exaggerated, but I didn't really mind.<br /><br />The message in The Lonely Hearts Club is great. I thought it might get too preachy, but it seemed very natural and worked well with the story. Yay girl power!<br /><br />The Lonely Hearts Club is just so freaking adorable. Really, that's the only way to describe this book. It's not the best-written, most meaningful book I've read, but it's pure fun. It's a cute, quick read - the perfect feel-good book!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Updated....within 2 hours of posting the review below, I received an email from Amazon letting me know that they were refunding my original purchase of the DVD and upgrading shipping service of the second DVD I purchased. I haven't seen the DVD yet, so this review is based on Amazon customer service. I am so pleasantly surprised by their quick response and willingness to replace a missing DVD a month after purchased. Thanks so much, Amazon!<br /><br />Bought this over a month ago. Just opened it this morning to watch and the case is empty! Next time I purchase a DVD via Amazon, I will definitely open immediately to confirm it is there. Recommend you do the same!
0061726834|4.0|I just love the whole idea for this book. The idea of considering love a disease that must be cured is genius - such a unique way of looking at it. That, combined with all the glowing reviews, and the fact that Lauren Oliver's debut, Before I Fall, is absolutely amazing, meant that my expectations for Delirium were through the roof. And for once, my expectations were met!<br /><br />The unique premise fascinated me throughout the book. Even though the book is mainly Lena's story, the plot is perfectly balanced with interesting world-building that really made me think. I loved the insight we got into this world with the help of the little snippets of The Book of Shhh. All these references and the way they seemed to rewrite history provided a unique worldview that fascinated me as a reader.<br /><br />I loved our main character, Lena. One of the reasons I don't read dystopian books too often - well, I've been into them since The Hunger Games got me in the mood, but I don't usually read a lot of them - is that I cannot seem to connect with the MCs. MCs in the dystopian genre always seem to be so heroic and special; they're the one who saves the world. But I want MCs who are normal - easy to relate to, and not someone who's braver and stronger than I could ever imagine anyone real being. And Lena, for once, is easy to relate to. Some might complain that she's boring, but I loved her. The way she sees the world is realistic, considering her background, growing up in this world and learning about love the way she did. Often, I find that in dystopians, the MC tends to question the government too quickly to be realistic, but in Delirium, the development is gradual, which I really appreciated.<br /><br />Delirium is a lot closer to contemporary than most dystopians I've read. There's not too much action - it's just about Lena's story and the world she lives in. That might be a problem for some people, maybe people who read more paranormal and dystopian and whatnot, but for alover of contemps like me, that's perfect. And in the end, we get our fair share of action - leaving me dying to read Pandemonium.<br /><br />I didn't love the romance at first - I found the set-up a little strange, and didn't really get Alex's immediate attraction to Lena. But once the two of them get to know each other, I loved them together! They have such great chemistry, and seeing them struggle to be together in a world like this was fascinating to read about.<br /><br />I loved Lauren Oliver's writing in Before I Fall, and I liked it in Delirium, too, but I think the descriptive style fits a little better to contemporary than to dystopian. When I read contemps, I look for descriptive, vivid, emotional writing like Lauren Oliver's, but for a dystopian, I think a little less details wouldn't have hurt, since the beginning is a little slow.<br /><br />Still, I really liked Delirium. It's one of those books you can just get lost in - I almost missed my stop when I was reading this book on the bus because I was so inmersed in the story. I will definitely be reading the rest of the trilogy!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this so fun me and my friend go back and forth all the time if I were you I would get it
0765316994|1.0|Sophomoric is the kindest word i can come up with. Boring might be another. Flat characters describes in 2 words, waste of money in 3 words. Hard to believe this is the same author that wrote the Old Man's War & the Ghost Brigades & Zoe's Tale all three of which i have read & re-read with joy....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />I am probably one of the harshest reviewers around.  I never gush and rarely hand out a 5 star rating (check my reviews). I am about to throw that reputation away because...<br /><br />Wool is worth six stars.  With effortless, excellent prose, a deep, morally complex story and sympathetic characters this is one of the reads of the 21st century.  Although the writing style is different the Wool compendium has echoes of Ray Bradbury (Fahrenheit 451) or Aldous Huxley(Brave New World).  The fact that I even *think* of placing Wool in the same category as those classics indicates how deeply impressed I am.<br /><br />Continue on sir, I cannot wait to see where you go next!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Lots of fun. Cant wait to get to the really hard ones but I am still learning some of the basics

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a good game!!<br />  :)I love it. nothing much to say though. I need more to say so this is a really good game.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I have been a fan of everyone in this piece and esp Sean Penn.  I continue to be as this real-life story has been presented to us all with reverently giving us a hero to know, want to know, to remember and to aspire to be more like -- Christopher MccCandless.<br /><br />He was born 2 days before me.  And died at a critical moment in my life, and here I sit 20 years later almost, he would have been 2 days older than me and 44.  I am honored to be given this amazing work of art and memorial of a life so well lived that I am propelled to know that we are all one and I feel him, need to know him and wish to be more of the wonderful qualities he was.<br /><br />My review is different than others here.  But all I can say is this is a story that everyone should see as the story itself must be felt inside, and that is hard to describe.  As a work of art, this work astounds.  Nothing can be said except good for the efforts of all.<br /><br />Stunning!
B000FC12YQ|5.0|She is a master writer! This book is interesting, with interesting characters and a fascinating plot. Her comments on human nature always get me thinking.
B007U2ABXM|5.0|She never really goes away, but when she gifts us with what she has found after going into the depths of the souls of cities and history and books and music where she explores the human heart, she brings back such gems melded by the fire of her own heart. This album is so full of the sweet voice of her youth intermingled with the wisdom of her age. It's a prayer, it's a tale, it's a calling for us all to rest in her arms while she lullabies us to dream of the places we want to go to find our own inner pathways to peace and victory. It's a must listen for old fans, but it's a great intro for the youth who have not listened to her yet. Don't waste another day not hearing this one!
1444737090|5.0|This is a wonderful book with interaction between a ginger cat and a street person. It is easy reading, but so factual, you can enter into the story and get a feel for both Bob, the cat and James. Both were needy and took each other on as family. It is heart touching, with laughter or tears, and speaks volumes of how animals and people communicate and need each other. It has a happy ending where James gained control over drugs, especially. And how the cat brought stability into James life! Everyone will love this story!
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line in this trilogy.  This is definetley for adult women, so nice to have books dedicated to adult readers.  The relationship between Anastasia and Christian is very believable; many times I could feel myself thinking along the same line of trust versus mistrust in a new relationship.  Enjoyed the whirlwind romance too. I will not add any \\"spoilers\\" so this is all I will say about this trilogy.  I do bet you won't be able to put it down once you start reading it. :)) Very interesting, humorous, suspenceful, and as such for me well worth the price.  However I do agree that the kindle price is a little too high; you would think that the Kindle version should be more economical; however I can't fault the author for this.
B0086700CM|5.0|alsom I love this game so much that I am adicket to it this is the best game ever no other game can beat it
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been looking for Temple Run for ever!!!  People say that it has stops but it does not.  My brother showed me it yesterday.  I've been playing nonstop
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I'm not sure I could quite enumerate the satisfaction this book delivers. The author is writing genre SF (not merely a parody, as the initial chapters might lead you to believe), *about* the process of creating genre SF. That's like a sniper firing two bullets, with the intent of hitting the second one with the first. I mean, sure, the Kaufman brothers did something like this with /Adaptation/, but that had Nic Cage in it, an actor so colossally bad that that I still love to watch that clip from the remake of /Wicker Man/ where he's forced to gargle bees, and therefore it doesn't count.<br /><br />I know that sounds stupid; I'm not a writer. Shut up. /Redshirts/ is a terrific work. Read it and enjoy.<br /><br />This work is so 'meta', I wish I could give it a rating in the form of a complex number, something like (5+4.5j), rather than \\"zero to five stars\\". I'm deducting half an imaginary point for for the spit-take he caused me to do between chapters 23 and 24.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|My copy only has 10 episodes but they don't match up with the book.  I feel ripped off.  Many scenes from the book are completely removed from the TV series.  I know that there are roughly 16 episodes planned for season 1 but I just don't see them here.  I've searched high and low.  I tried my DVD player, my Xbox, my computer but they all come up with ten episodes.<br /><br />I bought a second copy ($60 a pop) to unlock the other six episodes but that still didn't work.  I'm looking at HBO's site right now: sixteen episodes.  Why on Earth can't I get to them?  This is so frustrating.  I expected better of you George RR Martin.
0345803507|5.0|These books  are amazing. I got my a lot of my female family to read them, grate book can't put. It down
B001DJLCRC|1.0|This show was written by dirty scoundrels who hate the show \\"Weeds\\".  Watch \\"Weeds\\" and try to tell me that Breaking Bad isn't a complete rip off.  In Weeds a woman goes through a radical discovery/event in her life and turns to selling drugs to support her family.  At least the main character is attractive and capable of expressing emotions unlike Walter White who is just a hairy old man who does nothing but make the same exact \\"shocked\\" face after every single bad thing happens to him.<br /><br />When I first watched this show I loved it.  I worshiped it.  I became one with the show.  But then I saw \\"recommended for you\\"... \\"Weeds, season 1\\" and I watched it.  My life has changed.  Everything I thought about this show was wrong.<br /><br />Also, as far as \\"realistic\\" shows go, Breaking Bad is Star Wars.  There are so many ridiculous scenes (like at the end of episode 2).  Walter is a horrible \\"It's not fair\\" old bitter man character and Jesse Pinkman is a typical \\"yeah, baby, it ain't fair baby, it ain't far baby\\" 22 year old gangster character.<br /><br />After episode three the entire story of the TV show is done but instead of stopping they start all over again.  Then they do the same thing twice during season 2 and 3.  It's just awful.  Just because they have high quality cameras doesn't make this a good show.<br /><br />On a side note, there's a lot of not-so-subtle anti-Mexicano racism in this.  Most Mexicans (and blacks for that matter) are shown as drug dealers or being involved in crime somehow while white people are just trying to live their upper class lives, protecting their families.  Maybe I'm the only who feels for our Mexican brethren but I don't believe they deserve this kind of treatment.
B0086700CM|5.0|Started off not being able to get too far but quickly got the hang of it. Easy to learn hard to master.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Once I start playing this accursed game, I can't stop until forced to by a red-lighted battery indicator.  Then, I resent the time, albeit brief, it takes to charge. Serious competition for the Birds.
B0057B8PT0|5.0|I heard one song on Satelite Radio and searched out this CD. It is great from start to finish. My favorite song is \\"Dance With Me Tonight.\\" Just a great tune with a little old-time rock n' roll feel to it.  I don't know how much recognition this artist has in the USA but I hope others check out the disc. You will be pleasantly surprised!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is fun and extremely addictive. Works great on my kindle fire and on my droid incredible phone. Definitely worth downloading!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I must admit that when a friend of mine recommended this book for me I was skeptical. I have only ever read well known authors and books. Jamie McGuire did  not fail me! This book left me wanting more and drooling over a boy in a book. As one of the very first books this year Beautiful Disaster brought me back into my reading bookworm self and since then I have read so many books that have yet to reach the bar that was set for this book and yet they are all still amazing! Abby and Travis just have this amazing chemistry that only fictional characters can have and yet they have the same problems that real people can have. I have recommended this book to anyone and everyone that I have come across and I will continue to do so!
0307454541|4.0|I jumped on the \\"Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" trilogy after all three had been published and after reading an article in a magazine about the international sensation they'd created. Are they great literature? No. Are they rollicking page-turners? Yes, but with much more intricate plotting and more interesting characters than most. Sadly, all of the movie adaptations to date (all three Swedish films and the one English version with Daniel Craig) fail their source material. They all lack the detailed density of the books and are absent enormous sections of plot. And while both Book 1 (\\"Dragon Tatto\\") movies have been well received critically and at the box office, I honestly can't undertand how anyone who hadn't read the books would like the movies. They seem so comparatively hollow. Read the books, and hope that the next Daniel Craig installment does a better job at adaptation. One word of caution, however, regarding the books: since all the characters' names are Swedish, you're likely to find yourself having a hard time remembering who's who, at least at first. (Keep a cheat sheet as new characters are rolled out. And there are MANY of them.)
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|Kinda fun to play.  Great graphics and 3D effects.  I wish it was more like playing regular golf, though.  That would make it much more enjoyable!
0439023513|1.0|Ok. First two books were fun, exciting, interesting and action-packed. This one? .........................................<br />I was hoping for a story that actually made sense, but I guess that was too much to ask for in this book. This book had too many random one-note characters, a random plot, and a story that never really went anywhere. I was tired of hearing Katness' every thought and her going off and hiding or going crazy after every single thing that went wrong. I could go on, but I wont. The plot was boring and I tried to finish it, but I just skimmed over the rest just to find out what happened in the end. Too bad. The author shoulda ended the story after book two.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|totally love  love love this trilogy. can't seem to set it down. Very intense and disturbing at times but that is part of what keeps me reading. It is by far the best read I have had in a long time.
B0086700CM|5.0|So much fun and anyone can play it. It is my favorite game because it's very addicting. It is very great to pass time.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I like this show but you have to make sure you pay attention to all the gestures and remarks they say most of my friends dont find it funny but i do and i am in my 70's.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is the best I have read in a long time...Not for the weak at heart as some of the very detailed sex scenes are really HOT.....I have finished Part one and Part two and am now reading part three...it is worth every penny to buy and every minute you spend reading it..get it I promise you will not be disappointed....
B0086700CM|5.0|everytime I am bored I play this game and I have fun trying to beat my high score. everyone should play this when they are bored.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As I stated in my review of the first part of this trilogy, it is not for the weak at heart...very descriptive adult subject matter...it is however a very very good read...worth every penny to purchase and worth every second spent on reading it...enjoy..
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Read this book in a few hours, and thank you to the Kindle Lending Library, I am not 'out' $5.  I'm not sure what all the hoop-la is about. This isn't a new story, and it's not one that is particularly well-told. Thought the characters were rather predictable. I understand that this is considered a \\"young adult\\" novel, but consider it a bit too graphic to put in the hands of most young adults without a guide. Writing style definitely is geared to a younger audience. Try reading some of the prose out loud; it is almost laughable in spots. Even with the other 2 series books available through the Lending Library, I doubt that I will even borrow them. I really just don't care what happens to Kat or any of the others. I'll spend my reading time on something else.
0062197258|5.0|Into the Darkest Corner is billed as a psychological thriller and, boy oh boy, does it deliver!<br /><br />When Lancaster party girl Catherine Bailey meets the handsome and mysterious Lee Brightman, it's lust at first sight.  But Lee's charming smiles hides a violent streak.  Four years later Cathy, now living in London, spends hours compulsively checking the locks in her flat.  A new neighbour starts helping her overcome her fears, but then she receives word that Lee has been released from prison . . .<br /><br />Yes, the general plot is somewhat reminiscent of Sleeping with the Enemy, but the U.K. setting makes it feel fresh.  It's also well executed.  Elizabeth Haynes chose a unique narrative structure - both timelines unfold concurrently.  I found it annoying for the first 20 pages, but once I got into the flow, the intertwined stories really heightened the tension.<br /><br />While this story of domestic violence is riveting, it is the protagonist and her struggle with OCD that really captured my imagination.  Cathy's urge to check that the door is locked started out as a very logical step to ensure her safety.  You understand why it eventually controlled her and you root for her to break free from her compulsions.<br /><br />It's no exaggeration when I say I couldn't put this book down.  It totally consumed me and I read all 400 pages in less than 24 hours.  The climax isn't as dramatic as it could have been, but overall, it's a winner.<br /><br />Reader Advisory:  This book contains profanity, moderately graphic sexual content and violence.  If any of these things bother you, give this book a miss.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|A new album by The Beach Boys is a real gift to life long fans.  When they were recording this, Brian Wilson was interviewed and he said the sound was going to be just like in 1965.  He was right on the mark.  It reminds me of the same concept used on The Beach Boys Today!  Half the songs are fun in the sun good time music.  The other are more introspective and are a compelling listen.  The highlight for me is the last 4 tracks...every fan will appreciate the genius of Brian Wilson on these beautiful songs.  It is solid from start to finish, and it is a welcome comeback to the studio for America's Band.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Excellent movie.  The \\"live fire\\" scenes are unbelievable.  Saw it at the theater and buying it today.  The best movie that I have seen in a long time.
0545265355|5.0|I finished reading all three of the books in the \\"Hungar Games\\" Series about three weeks ago.<br />The three books are hard to put down and when finished you wish there were more. The story is hard to forget because, whether intentional or not, I think the book contains a warning for those of us living in the current time.

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Runner is an excellant game, at times boring but overall it is fun. in the beginning of the level it may require a bit more entertainment but when you get further into the game it becomes more fun
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay so this book is not for everyone, it does have explicit content, but I throughly enjoyed it all...  The author is somewhat repeatitive in her descriptions and her characters choice of dialogue but underneath it all is a very good romance that oozes chemistry that more adult fans, especially those who already enjoy bdsm/explicit novels, will cling too from page to page.  Having said that regarding the content and my preference in reading material, I work in a office full of women from all different walks of life and have children and they have read this book and really enjoyed the sensuality of the novel and the relationship between Ana and Christian.  In fact, from what I've heard during water cooler gossip their husbands are pretty tickled with their wives' renewed interest in the opposite sex regardless of where the inspiration came from. The conversations and actions between our two main characters will literaly be felt by you as a reader, and trust me folks, order the trilogy because you'll want to read these bad boys back to back because it will consume you and you'll have to see how it ends...
0345803493|5.0|Love that this book was as good or better than the first! I am invested in this couple and can't wait to turn each page as I read this book! It did not disappoint! I can't wait to read the third book in this trilogy!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addicting and very fun. If I'm ever bored I will start playing this game and I have never had any problems of a virus on this game. Few gliches but they are never really a big problem. Enjoy the game!!!

B003PIUC02|2.0|I expected way more from this series,  It was just an Xrated movie, with about the same story line. Could have been done easily in 1 1/2 hrs.  I have \\"Game of Thrones\\" season 1, and even though I have read all of the books published so far, and have given up on the author.  It is a 10, and Spartacus is a 2, don't waste your money!  Even the sex is tedious.  The acting was good considering what they had to work with.  The scene sets were terrible.<br />Enough said, don't waste your money.
B0085LGL5E|4.0|LEX HIVES is the first proper studio album by The Hives since 2007's THE BLACK AND WHITE ALBUM.  Their previous album found the band experimenting with new sounds to varying degrees of success.  Since that time, the band has put together a tight, loud, and rocking album.  Like previous Hives albums, LEX HIVES feels like it was culled from another decade; while this album does find the band in a few newer areas, the band still wears its influences like a badge of honor.  The result sounds familiar, but not quite unoriginal.<br /><br />The album announces itself with the opener \\"Come On!\\" and quickly moves into leading single \\"Go Right Ahead.\\"  Most the tracks last less than the 3-minute mark, so the attitude never wears out its welcome.  At their very best, The Hives make propulsive, engaging, undeniable rock-n-roll; this album has much of that to offer.  The problem with LEX HIVES is that the territory just feels too familiar.  Too often does the band find itself repeating the same tempos and dynamics with the same stomping sneer on its face.  The high points on the album (for me) come when the band changes up their songwriting formula.  Songs like \\"I Want More,\\" \\"Patrolling Day,\\" and \\"Without the Money\\" really stand out; the dynamics are different without removing what makes the band great.  The sagging last track \\"Midnight Shifter\\" proves to be a bit of a misstep for an otherwise engaging LEX HIVES.<br /><br />Fans of the Hives will absolutely love this album.  Anyone who enjoys the Rollings Stones earlier tunes, Iggy and the Stooges, or Highlight tracks to sample: \\"Go Right Ahead,\\" \\"I Want More,\\" and \\"Take Back the Toys\\" will give you a good idea what to expect from this album.  Overall, it's a good return to the slick, concise rock-n-roll that the band was known for -- definitely worth your time.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Took a chance on this as I had read many reviews saying the parts were small and easily lost.  Absolutely love it!  My six year old begs to play all of the time with anyone who will play.  The cards are easily figured out and there are so many possibilities of structures to be made.  Easy to keep score and build.  Fantastic toy. Couldn't get it for Christmas but now in the summer it was available, shipped quickly and worth the wait.
B0087UN94E|4.0|It's been too long since Neil Young and Crazy Horse have made a studio album together.  In previous years, Neil Young has released some fantastic folk records (PRARIE WIND), but he's been away from the rock-n-roll that marked his early career.  With Crazy Horse back in the studio, we're given a taste of the rocking Neil Young we used to know.<br /><br />AMERICANA isn't exactly a new album; it's an album of American folk classics.  AMERICANA isn't exactly that either, these songs aren't so much covers as much as reimaginings.  The opening track for example, \\"Oh Sussanah,\\" feels raw and built from the ground-up.  The renditions here don't feel reverent, they feel like live, off-the-cuff, jam sessions.  Many of these tracks feel like they were recording in one take, bringing an extra level of energy to these American standards.  At its very best, Neil Young and Crazy Horse breathe new life into old classics.  \\"Jesus Chariot\\" for example, has been played to death, but its appearance here on AMERICANA is exciting and raw.  These archaic public domain standards sound familiar but here, they are rarely boring.<br /><br />The album ends on an ironic \\"God Save the Queen.\\"  It feels like an appropriate and sarcastic ending to an album that never took itself too seriously.  Most the album is fun, but the rendition of \\"This Land is Your Land\\" feels like it goes on too long.  At its very worst, the album feels like a band simply warming up or doing a sound-check.<br /><br />Equal parts reverent, ironic, and raw, AMERICANA will leave you hoping that this isn't all that Neil Young and Crazy Horse have been working on lately.  Hopefully this album is just a studio warm-up for something more to come.  Recommended tracks for sampling: \\"Oh Sussanah,\\" \\"Jesus Chariot (She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain),\\" and \\"Wayfarin' Stranger.\\"  Most of editions of this album include videos for each song -- they are inessential, but a nice bonus.<br /><br />Fans of Neil Young and Crazy Horse should enjoy the loose, 70's rock that the band throws down here.  For the newcomers, this release won't give you a good reason to begin listening (it would be better to start with some of the earlier catalog).enjoy the loose, 70's rock that the band throws down here.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|A friend of mine told me I had to read this book.  I was not disappointed. It seemed to have a strange start with death being the narrator, but once I got started I couldn't put this book down until I finished it.  I read it in two days.  It shows the humanity, love, laughter and tears during a terrible time in history.  I will certainly look for any other books by this author, and have recommended the book to all of my friends.
B007WFQZF0|5.0|I first reviewed this album three months ago, and it never quite left me alone.  Accordingly, I've changed my review from 4 stars to 5, and I've edited the below details:<br /><br />Liars is a group that is  more concerned with creating interesting textures of sound rather than radio-ready hits. The group's previous catalog reflects a band that is conscious about each album's sound; constantly changing and tinkering with their sound, the group is known for drastic shifts in music between releases. WIXIW (pronounced \\"Wish You\\") is no exception as it finds the band changing direction once again.  This time, the group has found themselves in a dark avant-garde electronic-dance experiment.<br /><br />WIXIW sounds almost like a logical extension of Radiohead's KID A. The album is maintained by melancholy, haunting synthesizers and offbeat rhythms. Like past releases, the value of Liars' music lies in the depth of the album. Each play of the album will open and unlock previously unattended sounds, shifts, and textures; that's what they're made for. These albums are made to be poured over and explored. The discordant, atonal, and asynchronous touches of the album really pay off on repeated listens. The lead single, \\"No. 1 Against the Rush\\" isn't immediate, but it's a song that will stay with you long after its running time.  \\"His and Mine Sensations,\\" centers around a vocal line whose delivery is very much beautiful, dark, and a bit creepy; in a way, this line sums up the entire album.  \\"Ring on Every Finger\\" centers around a very unconventional loop, but the song, centering around near-tribal percussion is unforgettable.  Much of WIXIW is layered with dark samples and instrumentation, making this album less accessible to new listeners than previous releases.  I will say though, that if you stick with this album, it will open up in really rewarding ways.<br /><br />While the album does center much around the synth-heavy instrumentation, the band expands its sound from propulsive, rhythmic dance (\\"Brats,\\") to soundscaped ambiance that opens the album (\\"The Exact Colour of Doubt,\\") to the robotic flittering of closing track \\"Annual Moon Words.\\" WIXIW is both consistent and exploratory; as soon as you think you have it pinned down, it changes.  The first time I listened to WIXIW, it all kind of sounded the same, since the band largely sticks to the same instrumentation throughout the album -- what changes though, is how the band uses this instrumentation to create new and different sounds for each song.<br /><br />Fans of the tone, mood, and timbre of Radiohead's KID A (or maybe even some of the electronic side of Brad Sucks) will have a lot to explore WIXIW. This album (like previous ones by Liars) proves a good listen for anyone interested in music from a more cerebral point-of-view.  WIXIW can be dense and foreboding, but its nuance pays off in big ways if you stay with it.  Recommended tracks for sampling: \\"[[ASIN:B0081TZFGG No.1 Against the Rush]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0081TZG6U His and Mine Sensations]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0081TZGTW Brats]].\\"  Do yourself a favor and check out this album.ulsive, rhythmic dance (\\"Brats,\\") to soundscaped ambiance that opens the album (\\"The Exact Colour of Doubt,\\") to the robotic flittering of closing track \\"Annual Moon Words.\\" WIXIW is both consistent and exploratory; as soon as you think you have it pinned down, it changes.

0345803485|2.0|Okay, so I have never read this genre before but a lot of my girlfriends were talking about these books.  I just had to see what they were all talking about.<br /><br />As for the negatives:<br /><br />The writing was simplistic.  Omitting the sex scenes, this book reads like it was written by a teenager.  Descriptions of material goods (of which there were a lot because OF COURSE one of the main characters is a gazillionaire) were very detailed; all other descriptions were shallow and incomplete.  The author overuses certain phrases (Whoa; Inner Goddess (who says that???); biting my lip) to a point beyond distraction.<br /><br />Her lack of research on American culture was apparent in more than one spot - soccer rather than football, tea, holiday were a few that stick out.<br /><br />The characters were annoying and cliche and the plot was far fetched, ridiculous and more fantasy than anything.  The jacket should read:  The most handsome man on the planet, gazillionaire - without ever working, hyper jealous stalker accidentally meets beautiful tomboy, recent college grad who is a hardworking and long suffering bookworm virgin who never realizes when handsome, beautiful and eligible men were hitting on her.

A friend of mine asked  today if she should buy the second book;  I told her no.  I don't know if it is my unrelenting need to finish something once I start it or if I really wanted to know how it all ended but I spent the money and time and read all of it.

Did I enjoy them?  Sometimes.  Would I recommend them to a friend?  Maybe the first one - it's no fun to jump off a bridge alone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am definitely not into these types of books, but was coaxed to read it by a friend. I ended up finishing the first book within 2 days, reading quickly each time my one year old was napping. As soon as I finished, I purchased the second book. The story line was suspensful, not so much like in the thrillers I like to read, but I wanted to know what would happen next. By the end of the first book and through the next 2 books, I was skimming the \\"sex scenes\\" and trying to figure out what would happen with the characters next. It was a little predictable, but I couldn't put it down. I loved it and can't wait until she writes another book!

B003PTP4S6|5.0|Before I bought this terrific album as an unusual gift for a musician friend, I had never heard of Ennio Morricone, who composes both well-known movie themes and also background music for films. You'll recognize many of these pieces as soon as you hear them. Yo-Yo Ma plays beautifully, of course, as he always does, and he treats these pieces with the seriousness of purpose that they deserve. If you're looking for a real musical treat that's a little bit off the beaten path, then congratulations, you've found it!
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|While I feel Mechanize is a more even album overall, The Industrialist is a fine follow-up and the programmed drums sound amazing. I can only imagine the amount of effort it took to do that. My favorite FF drum sound though was Raymond Herrerra's performance on Archetype. His snare was really aggressive on that record and the snare drum on here is a bit muted in comparison.<br /><br />I docked a star because I was disappointed that the last two tracks on this album are both filler, especially after the epic ending that Final Exit provided on Mechanize.<br /><br />The most epic track on this album is God Eater. Simply a crushing industrial song with lots of cool electronic elements - certainly more than on the last several albums. Rhys Fulber is as reliable as ever providing the atmosphere that is a crucial part of the FF sound.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid FF album. Better than Digimortal and Transgression, but not quite as memorable as Obsolete or Mechanize.<br /><br />An easy purchase for metal fans and longtime fans of the band. Metal is becoming a stale genre as of late and Fear Factory continue to hold it all together.

0312944926|3.0|In this thrilling techno-thriller novel, Dan Brown brings to life what many have looked over in our generation. Under the exterior of easy-to-follow user interfaces is the foundations of which allows everything to operate. Every waking moment, information travels over the internet, but in order to prevent others from sticking their heads where they shouldn't, encryptions have been applied, and the job of Susan Fletcher is to break encryptions of information from terrorists that could pose a threat to national security with the assistance of an invincible code-breaking machine. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel because of its fast paced nature with Brown constantly keeping me involved with the novel. Dan Brown gave strong personas to his characters, and I couldn't help admiring the idea of the protagonist although some of the decisions seem irrational. I admittedly chose this novel out of the interest of the manifestation of powerful, constant evolving technology. But with a theme of technology mixed with cryptology, any reader will be easily hooked onto this read. This novel is different from his more famous works, i.e. The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. While there is a deep focus on religion and conspiracies in those novels, Digital Fortress maintains the cryptology aspects and instead has a more fast paced novel with action and excitement. I enjoy the book mostly because it is easy to follow, not having to try to understand Brown's diction or metaphors. Sometimes we all need a novel like this to unwind yet stay captivated.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|II made the mistake of falling for the viral hype on this book. It's too expensive for what it is. I couldn't get past page three. The writing is BEYOND terrible. It's supposed to be saucy and sexy. All I got was pitiful and badly written. I didn't even give the characters a chance they were so hopeless. And story? Forget it. If I'm going to read smut, I'm going to read real smut. Not this stuff. If you're looking for saucy and sexy and a real flare for BDSM, look elsewhere. This book is the laughing stock of the genre. If you can even classify it as part of the genre.
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|I should have known. I finshed the first book in a weekend, ending in a marathon sitting that had me finishing it at 7AM, having read the whole night through. My girlfriend said it was like I disappeared for a couple days. I guess I was in Sandersons world.<br /><br />A day later, I had some free time, so I thought: I'll just take a quick peekeroo at the sequel. And make sure not read too much: I got crap to do.<br /><br />So it's about 15 hours later, and I just finished reading the 800 pages of whatever the hell mistborn 2 is called: well of ascension or something? I READ  IT TOO FAST TO EVEN KNOW WHAT IT'S  CALLED. And I still have that crap to do.<br /><br />On to the book! So there's a couple armies laying siege to our heroes' city blah blah blah you know the summary. And there IS a lot of blah blah in this book, compared to the tight plot of the previous book. A lot of time is spent in a sort of political deadlock or whatever. Not as interesting as the first book. And the relationship between the new mistborn and Vin rang false for me. But I liked Sazed's story as well as the humanizing of Breeze who was a kind of a stereotype on the previous book.<br /><br />It DOES pay off with a crazy exciting finale, though. Obviously a set-up for the final third book. Which I'm deleting from my kindle. At least until I finish that crap I have to do.

I think it achieves perfectly what it was made for...Can't understand the people that have said that this movie is not good at all. Actually Cage is trying some new body language and his character Blaze is just really sarcastic and pissed of because of his curse. He hasn't made peace with it, so that's why he is like he is...Still it's not a deep movie, but it was never meant to be!!! I enjoyed both Ghost Riders movie. But this one is much more fun than the other one!!! If you're expecting a drama like the new Batman movies (which I LOVE!)then this one is not for you. If you want to have fun and see the Dark Side of Blaze then GET THIS MOVIE!!! I loved it...

B004XQYBA2|5.0|With the latest updates, the developer has made this the best Sudoku app for Android. The dev was great the way he responded to my emails. I sent a couple of observations &amp; suggestions, not expecting any response. I mean, what's the opinion of one user worth? I was surprised when he wrote back the next day saying &quot;thank you&quot; and that he had implemented one of my ideas.<br /><br />THAT'S what I call support! One day service with an email &amp; an update.<br /><br />The interface is practically perfect now and the ability to import multiple formats of sudoku files is great! A key feature, for me, is the ability to play without an Internet connection - the Sudoku app I played before has a great interface, but you need a connection to start a new game. Annoying when you want to play a new game in a dead zone. Being able to easily disable OpenFeint (yuck, spit :) ) is a definite plus.<br /><br />Make sure you check out Sudoku Grab n Play from the same developer. It lets you take a picture of a Sudoku board &amp; import it into Sudoku 10000 Plus to play.

B0006ZFQNU|5.0|One of the founding members of the Amadeus String Quartet apparently didn't like the name chosen by the other members of the group which was originally called the Brainin Quartet, after first violin Norbert Brainin. Luckily, he changed his mind, because the Amadeus Quartet's recordings of Mozart's works for string quartet and string quintet are among the finest ever recorded. Violist Cecil Aronowitz proves the perfect fifth wheel in these great recordings for DG. The playing \\"goes like oil,\\" as Mozart wanted for his piano music, and everything is engaging, interesting, entertaining, and hightening of all the aesthetic senses. There are at least four masterpieces in this collection of pieces composed at different times of Mozart's career, and the other two works are worth hearing, including the early Qunitet No. 1, K. 174, from around Mozart's 18th year. The great works are No. 4 in c minor (a transcription of a wind quintet), No. 5 in D, No. 3 in g minor, and No. 2 in C.<br /><br />  The recorded sound is remarkably even in excellence even though these recordings were made over an eight year period.

B00000J7SS|5.0|I have read all the reviews here, the positive ones and the negative ones. A lot of them are totally wrong in terms of approach. There are a lot of people here that wouldn't recognize art even if it would bite their bottoms. This album clearly is an edgy album, one of those albums that you love or hate. This just means something, that some people know what art is and many more don't. Art exists to move our consciences, to let us ask ourselves who we are, what do we stand for, it should always let us feel something good or bad. Art is not \\"beauty\\" for the sake of, art is not \\"conformism\\", art is not \\"mannerism\\", art is a powerful, bloody, high idea. It's a way to say something powerful that will mean something to many people, maybe not to everybody, but to a lot of people. In the end, ask yourself, what is there in life that we all love in the same way? Nothing. Simply nothing. What I love, probably is something a lot of people would hate and viceversa. So art it shuld be this way, it is just like life. It doesn't exist something in art which is beautiful for everybody in the same way, this is perfect. This album is important just for this. It is a perfect representation of art, so a perfect representation of life, of it's flowing nature, of its unidentifiable nature, of its essence. I'm not saying these things to sound hip, or to sound intelligent. This is what this album says to me, to my deepest sensibility. For instance I perceive in the Pharaoh's Dance the truest pulse of life, it expresses exactly to me the \\"long and winding road\\" that life is, the problems and the difficulties everyone should face in his life, it is a representation of the battle for life, which is the essence of our everyday since the cave man. Guys, I am madly in love with Bebop, Bird and all that glorious stuff. And, imagine, I DON'T LIKE MILES generally speaking, just because I love the true bebop language and he wasn't that great in the idiom (we all know this, Clifford,Lee Morgan, Hubbard, a lot of trumpet players could make circles around Miles in the bebop idiom). That is my kind of Jazz, bebop. But here Miles touched something powerful that was inside his troubled personality and was able to let it speak to the world. And it touches me, it really sends shivers down my spine, I travel in a world of images and dreams with this album, it seems to me to go back in time, to the origins of the earth. This music has to do with the essential elements, fire, water, air, earth. It speaks the language of the Nature forces themselves, wildly, unrestrained, limitless, untamable. It's like diving deep inside a volcano, swimming in a sea of lava, drinking the purest water, being wiped out by the storm. It is these kind of emotions the ones that I feel when I listen to Bitches Brew. Guys, you have to leave it all behind to enjoy this experience. You can't think to Glenn Miller, to Bird using those parameters to judge BB, andhoping to get it, to enjoy it, just like you couldn't appreciate Pollock thinking to Caravaggio (and I am italian). Art should be free, should be able to breathe, to run, to sweat, to blood, ... art it is not a reassuring picture of the past. The greatness of this album, is that it is still alive decades after its release, it still speaks to my essence, to what I have in my spine, to the ancient part of my brain, not to a code that I have learned to appreciate through my study and my understanding of music, Jazz and human expression in general. It is like being in the eye of a storm, naked, it's like diving in the waves of a stormy sea. So please, don't write stupid reviews saying that this album doesn't swing, that it doesn't have a musical significance or that this music is just a noisy absurdity. Be serious, elevate yourself. Reconnect with your soul and relearn to feel. Than listen to BB again, and listen carefully to your reactions.d, a lot of trumpet players could make circles around Miles in the bebop idiom).

B007WFR1MQ|5.0|If you were hoping Fear Factory would build on the positive response to their Mechanize album and go with a crushing assault of thrash and groove influenced by hardcore and industrial, their new release should hit the spot.  The core of The Industrialist is Fear Factory doing what they do best.  Even though they've incorporated scores of different styles on their past efforts, they've always sounded the most potent and capable when they keep their aggressive side at the forefront.<br /><br />They're smart to open each song with an energetic blast of either speed or power/groove, then play some softer parts around the middle, then alternate back and forth.  It gives even the tracks that have a little less punch an overall scorching impression.  Fear Factory remind me of Machine Head in that they have grown over the years and found the perfect blend of the various styles they play, making their songs cohesive and confident instead of awkward and confused, as both bands have sounded at times in the past.<br /><br />For this release, I think you'll get the most enjoyment out of it if you're a fan of Demanufacture.  They went for that album's ultra-heavy, aggressive approach on Mechanize, but I could swear I heard some traces of Meshuggah on some of those songs.  The Industrialist features a greater focus on their trademark, precision guitar-and-drum machine-gun attack established on Demanufacture, enhanced by the incredible drum programming done by John Sankey and resulting in a strong thrash presence overall.<br /><br />Along those lines, this album also sees notable emphasis on the essential sound effects and keyboard work of Rhys Fulber, who I think of as a full-fledged member of the band.  A highlight for me is the Fear Is The Mindkiller vibe he creates on parts of God Eater; awesome song!  Make no mistake, The Industrialist is a fantastic album.<br /><br />One warning may be in order, though.  I'm betting quite a few people will be unhappy that this only has eight traditional songs, and that tracks 9 and 10 are both semi-instrumental ambient pieces with intermittent whispered or spoken vocals.  I'm not crazy about this being the album's end, but honestly, the first eight songs smoke so hard that it's tough to complain.<br /><br />Like I say, though, I know some people are going to gripe, but this is a concept album based on a story by singer Burton C. Bell, so I'm guessing that has everything to do with the decision to close it this way.  If you get the digibook special edition, you can read the story and try to piece together the connections between the story's tone and those last two tracks.  Bottom line is, if you like Fear Factory, you'll be pleased. They've put together a stunning effort that solidifies their return and ought to make any metal fan look forward to their next release. It's a 9.5/10 for me.traditional songs, and that tracks 9 and 10 are both semi-instrumental ambient pieces with intermittent whispered or spoken vocals.

B007RKPO84|5.0|Ahh, Kreator.  Good ol' Kreator.  You can always count on Mille and Co. to deliver.  Out of all the old-school thrash bands, you know there are certain ones you can depend on, like Overkill or Testament, and that also seem to get better with age.  Kreator is right up there with the best of them, and they've released a devastating album in Phantom Antichrist.  The songs vary from stomping, high-speed thrash to melodic power metal, and are all superbly skilled, inspired examples of epic songwriting and musicianship.  It almost reminds me of classic-era Metallica.  Technically proficient, heavy-but-catchy, dramatic and compelling; Kreator have proven again that they are the epitome of professional, accomplished metal musicians.  Every song is a highlight, but listen to Civilization Collapse if you want an idea of what this album has to offer; it absolutely smokes!  These guys don't disappoint when it comes to writing some of the best music in all of metal.

B003WE9TU8|4.0|Now this book starts off great and I loved how real it felt the whole time I was reading it. It does however become quite boring in the end with all the talk of strategies and the winding down of the story. But as I indicated in the title it is an overall good read.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Great movie adaptation of the book a Princess of Mars! Fun, exciting, endlessly beautiful and fascinating! I recommend it for the whole family!
B007N85ZXY|4.0|So we know that sometimes Neil Young just throws paint at the canvas and see's what happens. The results have a tendency to be a mixed bag sometimes... but we also know that Neil and the Horse are for the most part one of the crunchiest rock and roll outfits ever shredded. I think we get both sides of the coin here.<br /><br />What is happening on this album may seem like a total catastrophe to some listeners. Old Suzanna and Clementine? Yikes.<br /><br />In my opinion some tracks do indeed cry yikes. Right off the bat I didn't care too much for the lead off tracks. Suzanna is ok, but I can see the novelty wearing off real fast, especially with the digital looping of the vocals (why is anyone still using that technique in the studio these days--it doesn't sound good!) Clementine can take a bath in the salty brine for all I'm concerned. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the disc, aside from the mess of God Save The Queen at the end, I think the rest of the album pulls out classic Crazy Horse rockin... TOM DULA clocks in at just above 8 minutes and it jams, GALLOWS POLE is cool, HIGH FLYIN BIRD and WAYFARIN STRANGER are highlights. I got into THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND even if it is a bit pedestrian, and I dug the doo wop bop of GET A JOB.  Hey it's more of a paint splash then a Neil Young masterpiece thats for sure... but it still rocks out in several spots, I'm a give it four stars...

1609611543|5.0|Few books I've ever opened were more personally needed by the American people than this one, Wheat Belly. Yes, obesity may be a western disease but it's also distinctly an American one as we lead the civilized world in terms of obesity rate. The explanation and theories that Dr. Davis provides here are incredibly educational, and it probably will result in your changing your behavior immediately. I know I have. No more bread for dinner, and no more baked goods for breakfast. Indeed, I only read it a week ago and already I am very conscious of how serious my carbohydrate addiction was along with how much I was over-eating on a daily basis. In less than 7 days, my appetite has noticeably lessened and I don't feel as irritable between meals as I used to feel. The exorphin explanation for why wheat products are so uniquely addictive is most convincing, and again, it makes perfect intuitive sense based on personal experience. Before reading this I sort of felt like I was more of a slave to my appetite than most of the people I knew. Now I see that my counter-productive behaviors were merely a product of bad habits I'd been practicing since I was a child. I thank Dr. Davis effusively for publishing this, and am indebted to him for his research. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|I won't go into each and every song here, lots of great reviwers have done that already. Besides, it all comes down to what songs YOU like best. Being a huge fan of Keane, I will tell you this:<br /><br />I heard Somewhere Only We Know and fell for Keane. I fell so hard that I got the album and played it over and over and over for months. I recommended it to everyone, constantly. Okay, I didn't love the laser-ish sounds in a few songs, but overall it was one of the best albums I've ever owned. Ever.<br /><br />So, if you loved that album like I love that album, I'd suggest giving the song Strangeland (not the album, but give that specific song a listen) and if you don't love it, then maybe MAYBE you won't love this album. I've just found that the track Strangeland is the closest to the good ole days of Keane.  Personally, I also LOVE the song Sovereign Light Cafe. I think it's very 'Keane' as well. My other favorite is Watch How You Go. In all honesty thought, I love all of the songs on here, except Neon River.<br /><br />I recommend this as a gift. To anyone, even those who don't love Keane or this type of music. It's fun, it's got slow songs too, it's long..lots of music here. Welcome back Keane, we have sooOOoo missed you!!

I hope it has more about Sam Vimes Junior in it as he is growing into a very interesting character.
0393088774|4.0|I have read  \\"End this Depression Now\\" and both enjoyed it and learned from it. It's written lucidly for us non-economists.<br /><br />I agree with all the positions Krugman takes, save one - his championing of inflation.<br /><br />I understand the points he raises in favor of allowing \\"modest\\" inflation, but nowhere do I see any sensitivity on his part to the situation of us senior citizens.<br /><br />I am 71. My wife Ruth is 65. We are retired (and hove moved to Dominica so as to avoid becoming elderly poor in our former home in Massachusetts). People like us can't exist with inflation eating away at our fixed incomes (supplemented by IRA disbursements). We can't return to work and have no time left to realize investment appreciations, nor can we accept risk - we must adhere to capital preservation. Social Security doesn't give us a break: Our benefits aren't being indexed. And even if they were, neither the CPI nor some core inflation measure reflects the terrible inflation we see in medical and medical insurance costs. Anyhow, any indexing we would get would be after the fact.

B0025KVLTM|1.0|Something that has kept recurring to me for decades (but I almost always hold my peace ... piece?):<br /><br />Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band sucks.<br /><br />... as bad as any disco Bee Gees, ... worse, at least you could dance to that. ... and maybe even get ... uh..lucky. But SPLHCB (jeeze, even the acronym sounds like someone losin' their lunch) is the most overrated crap ever inflicted on the music-buying public - that's millions and millions worldwide. Even me ... and I bought the CD long after I realized this. What a sap!<br /><br />Let's think about this in an analytical fashion-<br /><br />1. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<br />- A jingle, a commercial, but any 60's Fritos commerial has a better hook and more artistic integrity.<br /><br />2. With A Little Help From My Friends<br />-The oom-pah begins. Maybe Englishmen liked this kind of crap before they heard Bo Diddly, but this is 1967, c'mon ... pure white bread with a little sugar. Joe Cocker must have recognized its wretchedness and so covered it like Coltrane ripped My Favorite Things. Not buying my bs? ....<br /><br />Beatles:<br />[Just listen to any one of the dozen old or \\"new\\" \\"remastered\\" releases that we chumps all just keep a-buying.]<br /><br />Cocker:<br />[Do a video search for \\"Joe Cocker - With a little help from my friends\\" just like that, on that popular video site, the URL of which I can't post in a review.]<br /><br />Case closed on that one. (If you're still unconvinced, you need a lot more help than your friends are likely trained or qualified to give.<br /><br />3. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds<br />-LSD? Lennon's childhood? ... Did Phil Spector sneak into the studio? ...Who cares?<br /><br />4. Getting Better<br />-No, it's not. oom-pah, oom-pah, speeded up and accented ...<br />I'm getting sleepy.<br /><br />5. Fixing A Hole<br />- It's warm, it's cozy, I'm asleep.<br /><br />6. She's Leaving Home<br />-Okay (yawn). But Dylan said it far better three years earlier in just one line: \\"Come mothers and fathers throughout the land, and don't criticize what you can't understand\\" ... okay, two lines.<br /><br />7. Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite<br />-Really good, ... for when you really need a good dose of circus music.<br /><br />8. Within You Without You<br />-Best cut on the album. Damn. George Harrison noodling around on a sitar is the best damn cut on a Beatles album. ...Damn.<br /><br />9. When I'm Sixty Four<br />-I guess this oom-pah oom-pah drivel probably WAS appreciated by folks who were 64 in '67, but the rest of us were suckers.<br /><br />10. Lovely Rita<br />-Ground-breaking fusion of oom-pah, munchkin music, and wall-of-sound.<br /><br />11. Good Morning Good Morning<br />-Finally, entertainment! ...but the entertainment is watching my dog go bat-shite crazy at the animal sounds. Is this a Mc Donald's commercial or something now?<br /><br />12. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)<br />- A reprise, yet, for those who didn't get it the first time. Even Hendrix couldn't save this one.<br /><br />13. A Day In The Life<br />- A good song. Should have been released as a single - the B-side to Within You Without You.<br /><br />So, there you have it. Two keepers, 11 jokes.<br /><br />It was all in the packaging: First album (LP) cover ever great for cleaning reefer. After the brilliant Rubber Soul and Revolver, in 1967, that was enough.<br /><br />There. With the help of a couple pours of Jameson 12, finally got that off my chest.

B000VSAEYI|2.0|Edited to add: On the 3rd day, the pool became non-functioning. While my girl's had a blast, a value problem in the sprinkler caused the pool to rip from the inside out. Even with the patch kit, you can't save that type of tear and the entire base section that should be filled with air began to fill with water. I let it drain, dry out, and attempted to blow it up again deciding to just forgo the sprinkler system because my girl's loved it so much. Unfortunately, for every sprinkler hole it leaked and within 5 minutes, water was spilling out the sides---Amazon is returning it, but because they are out of stock can't replace it. While they offered to re-order it with the company currently selling it, that would have meant over $20 more than I spent on an item that broke in the first 72 hours.<br /><br />In the mean time, my husband and I drove out to WM and just grabbed a Banzai Whale Pool for our girl's. While it's no where near as big, I can physical return it to the store if the same thing occurs.<br /><br />Switching from 5 stars to 2. It's a cute idea, just needs better quality materials used.<br /><br />****************<br /><br />I bought this a few days ago and didn't spend near $52...and wouldn't have for that price, but for the $37 I spent, it's amazing. While I do see having to fill-up the air every few days as a realistic thing, I kind of expect that from any inflatable pool and it had no holes or tears when we received it.<br /><br />The pool toys it comes with are awesome---the turtle has jingle balls inside so my daughters enjoy that. The sprinkler system sends the water well above my head (I'm nearly 5'10\\") and it took some getting used to, but you can adjust the pressure of your hose to decide how high it goes. Even without the sprinkler, our slide stayed wet enough to go down because of the water in the wading pool area.<br /><br />I have 2 little girls, ages 3.5 and newly 2, despite their age difference my daughters are both 35 lb, both tall for their ages, and neither had any issues with the slide. So far, that is their favorite part.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be to add a drain hole behind the slide because that is where the most water seems to accumulate.<br /><br />However, this is an amazing ocean pool center that will be well loved throughout the summer!

B004EPYZP8|3.0|The courtroom dialogue is, at least, almost realistic, because the movie script was based on a mystery novel by an LA writer who once covered courts in LA and Florida, so he knows his stuff. I had to pause the movie half a dozen times, though, to get through it. There's not much tension or suspense. It's got the whiff of a TV movie about it. The gimmick of having the lawyer ride around in his chauffeured 1987 Lincoln wasn't enough to make me care about the characters here, despite a somewhat big name cast. You can only do so much with thin material. And the central idea, to free a wrongly imprisoned man, gets obscured by the main action revolving around a lightweight performance by Ryan Phillipe as the bad guy rapist/killer. This is okay, but it's not top drawer.
0765316994|5.0|I expected to like this book.  I was wrong.  I Loved this book.  Love.  With a capital L.  From the dedication which starts \\"To Wil Wheaton, whom I heart with all the hearty heartness a heart can heart\\", to the very end which I won't tell you because I don't believe in spoilers, and even into the Acknowledgements, where I saw the names of people I know of and a couple I actually know.<br /><br />Scalzi has taken his regular mix of scifi, humor, intelligence, great plots, and a twist from somewhere that isn't even in the ballpark, let alone left field, and upped the ante.  Fun and thought-provoking, with a touch of existentialism, all wrapped up in a bright red cover.  As I said, Loved it.<br /><br />It wasn't until actually reading the book that the \\"a novel with three codas\\" bit sank in.  There was the basic story-line,  which you can read plot summary elsewhere. But if you were ever glued to those adventures with Captain Kirk, Bones, and Spock, and their away missions, you'll be smiling.  The ending of the first bit, and then the codas are what takes it all to a different level. He did it -- Scalzi boldly went there.  And lucky us. He took his readers and fans along.<br /><br />My thanks to Tor for sending me a copy of this book.

B007XF4J70|5.0|Even after 70 years, the greatness of CASABLANCA remains timeless. This captivating classic, so vividly played out and cinematically crafted, is a textbook example of the Hollywood studio system at its absolute best.<br /><br />The 70th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition restores the film's pictorial splendor, surpassing the previous version which used too much DNR. This time the film's inherent grain texture isn't smoothed away along with a measure of sharpness, but is evenly configurated resulting in perfect black and white image resolution that replicates 35mm film.<br /><br />CASABLANCA is offered both as a Blu-ray/DVD special combo package and as a single Blu-ray disc.  The big set comes with an array of bonus material, much of which was bumped over from the previous Blu-ray edition, including the commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer. There's also some photographic and printed memorabilia, and a few new documentaries on the making of the film, on its director, Michael Curtiz, another on the history of Warner Bros., and one on its chief mogul, Jack L. Warner. The single Blu-ray has all the video/audio extras except the two Warner documentaries, and doesn't include any memorabilia items.<br /><br />One of my all-time top favorites, CASABLANCA is a movie I enjoy playing again and again, and if that's true of you, then this upgrade is a must.

B00003CXPD|5.0|I read this review and thought it was great : [...]<br />By Georgia Xanthopoulou<br /><br /> I danced myself right out the womb<br /> I danced myself right out the womb<br /> Is it strange to dance so soon?<br /> - Cosmic Dancer by T. Rex<br /><br />In 2001, I went to the cinema one day to see a movie hailed as the `feel-good' movie of the year. Heart-warming, inspiring, sweet and funny, Billy Elliot, directed by Stephen Daldry, was the thing at that time. I remember waiting in line to get my ticket and glancing over at the poster. A young boy, in his trunks, standing in line between young girls in tutus, apparently going to a dance class. I was thinking that it would probably be a movie which poked fun at the fact that a boy wanted to do ballet, much ala The Full Monty. And even though Billy Elliot has glimpses of that angle on the issue, I was grateful it was so much more than just that.<br /><br />Billy Elliot is a young boy living near Newcastle in 1980s miner-strike England. Coming from a family of miners who strive to get by, he discovers he likes to dance more than he wants to box and be like his dad and older brother. Billy is sweet, caring and trapped in a life that seems to be predetermined. Essentially, the film is a coming of age story, a story of being brave enough to be yourself and how fun and difficult the road to discovery is. All that's good and nice. The best thing about Billy Elliot, though, is how easily, passionately and truthfully it manages to convey the liberating feeling of dance.<br /><br />There are a lot of Hollywood films that try to show how glamorous but hard, exhilarating but spirit-breaking dancing can be but most of them cling to such stereotypical representations of dance and dancers that it's better to just fast forward to the dance scenes. And, sometimes, those aren't that good either. Billy Elliot is such a special dance film because it doesn't reproduce stereotypes or, at least, tries to address them. Billy's sexuality as a dancer is, in some ways, a big part of the film as he's too young to really know yet. And when one would think that ballet would help him realise that he's gay, or reaffirm his masculinity, as in many film that concerns men dancing, the film allows for neither to happen. Billy, portrayed by Jamie Bell in a once-in-a-lifetime performance, has no such revelations, stays somewhere in between the two choices the entire time in order to make the point that dance has nothing to do with sexual orientation. Billy is a dancer. And it's the story of a dancer we're watching, above everything else.<br /><br />Billy Elliot succeeds so well in showcasing how much Billy overcomes in his effort to become a dancer because the film is set, very strategically, during the miners' strike of the 1980s. Billy`s too young to be concerned with such issues but his whole family is very much affected by it and, as a result, so is he. His mother has passed away a long time and he has been raised by his dad, older brother -- two very `macho' type men -- and his grandma, who suffers from dementia. In this way, taking ballet lessons is not only controversial in terms of sex but also in terms of class as well. Again, many films deal with how ballet is considered a `high art' and the struggles to blend it with today's pop culture -- since the films are a product of that culture as well (see Save The Last Dance or Flashdance)- but they, again, merely touch upon that tension, turn it into another plot point and then find a neat resolution which suits the rule of the `mandatory' happy ending. At the opposite end, Billy Elliot places that tension in the centre of the film, definitely uses it to create some sense of suspense and agony but also goes deeper into the subject as it explores the restrictions the class system places on people which are not easy to surpass. By the end of the film, Billy's family is still, pretty much, the same in terms of class and even Billy keeps his northern accent. And even though Billy immerses himself in such a `high brow' world, through ballet, there's no clear severance of ties or the insinuation that his whole family is, by the end, taken care of because of it. It's still a struggle, as class barriers are hard to overcome.<br /><br />More than anything else, Billy Elliot is about dancing and not what it takes to succeed but what it takes to really be a dancer. Dance scenes blend ballet with jazz, boogie and tap and almost appear as a somatic reaction to everything that`s happening around Billy rather than being parts of a specific choreography. Again, there are many dance films that have their protagonists spontaneously break out in dance (like in Footloose). What's so special about Billy Elliot is that this is consistently done throughout the film. It's not just in one scene which would serve to showcase how the character is a natural dancer. Billy oozes dance in almost every scene, skipping on the street, running around the house or angrily tap dancing as a reaction to his father and dance teacher fighting over him. Billy dances when he's angry, sad or emotional, happy or, even, bored. And it never gets boring, exactly because all these reactions and feelings come as a natural result of the tension between his life and background and his passion for ballet. And the film cleverly uses not only the politics of the era but, also, the soundtrack in order to connect Billy's rawness when dancing with the hard times his family is going through. From T. Rex's Children of the Revolution to probably one of the most gripping and creative tap dance scenes ever to grace a film, choreographed to The Jam's A Town Called Malice, Billy Elliot is all about how dancing can be a creative outburst in times of turmoil and trouble. Billy is going through personal turmoil, letting it all out, dancing as England crumbles under pressure at the same time. Dancing becomes a reflex, a defense mechanism, a therapeutic process, an act of resistance and the only thing of beauty in an, otherwise, grey and miserable environment all at once.<br /><br />Billy Elliot is an exciting film to watch, as unique as its protagonist. It's an unusual coming of age story, as Billy`s love of dance is what makes him grow and not his first love, as it usually happens in such films. The film's cinematography is gritty and fresh, though nostalgic, its script humorous and thoughtfully emotional, its characters interesting and real, even though imagined. Above all, Billy Elliot is an extraordinary dance film as it doesn't use dance just as another metaphor for the American dream. Billy Elliot knows exactly what it feels to only be able to express yourself through dance and the freedoms that dance allows you, at that moment. It's a film that lets everyone know the truth about dance. When you dance you `forget everything. You're there, flying, like a bird. Like electricity'. And that's what watching Billy Elliot can feel like as well. Yeah, electricity

0441020712|4.0|In the latter half of the twenty-second century, Africa is the world's superpower.  For the most part, after barely surviving the Anthropocene climatic change disaster, national hostilities, violent crime and poverty no longer exist as a death from disease or a murder in an outpost in Europe or Australia become featured on the Nairobi news.<br /><br />In this pristine realm, Geoffrey Akinya relishes his field studies of the elephants of the Amboseli basin.  However, his pleasure is disrupted, but not by the death of his space exploring grandma Eunice who was the matriarchal cornerstone of the powerful Akinya business empire.  Instead, soon after Eunice's ashes are scattered on Mt. Kilimanjaro, he is blackmailed into looking at a potentially embarrassing incident on the moon where like elsewhere in the solar system colonization is growing by those who prefer not to reside inside of Earth's Surveyed Zones.  He and his sister Sunday's mission are to insure no scandal erupts, but what they learn about a secret of their grandma shakes their core while this twin cousins Hector and Lucas take a different approach.<br /><br />This is an exciting futuristic science fiction tale in which the world building is phenomenal though only surfaces when an aberration occurs like a Caucasian or not speaking Swahili although a key element the Mechanism monitoring humans seems to Big Brother intrusive (and too selective).  Sunday is the more aggressive of the siblings as they investigate a moon incident that damns their family if surfaced and may destroy their world.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kitchen house was an amazing read.  I couldn't put it down.  The story was not excessively long but kept my interest so well I may not have noticed!  The story line of course encompasses the very sad and unfortunate black history but redeems itself with the last \\"free\\" slave owner. It is always appalling to read how human beings were treated and sold without regard, often families were never re-united. The author portrayed the pain and suffering as if you were present.  I personally was disappointed that someone else didn't end up in the outhouse but hoped that he ran far away!!  What a wonderful book!!!

A fun read.  Yes it is all about SEX and not much else.  The big thing is to note that all forms of any tactile act is by consent.<br /><br />What fun, it does bring back memories, and it is revitalising.<br /><br />This is an easy fun read for any mature adult with an open mind and a loving partner.  Be brave and ENJOY
0345803485|1.0|I will try my hardest not to intellectualize a book that was clearly not meant for consumption by those who value good literature.  Nor do I presume to be the authority in the erotica genre, having only dabbled a little in Anne Rice's homoerotic vampire scenes.  But to remain silent as this book continues to top best sellers' lists and penetrate women's conversations (pun intended) is simply a travesty to all things literary.<br /><br />It's not surprising, however, that Fifty Shades of Grey is resonating with so many women (I'm not aware of many men reading it).  It perpetuates the same old patriarchal ideas about our society; the notion that women WANT to be submissive, that women WANT to be exploited, hurt, demoralized by men. And we are eating it up. This book does not in any way contribute positively to the dialogue of women and equality.  And I get it, it's not trying to do that.  And for those who say, it's just entertainment. Stop reading so much into it. Well, I say, \\"EVERYTHING is open to interpretation, and it is our duty to analyze everything that we are exposed to, but even more so, things that are so far reaching in influence and popularity.\\"<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey has become a phenomenon in the pseudo-literary world because of its shock value. But also because, as in all other genres, what becomes part of popular culture, consumed and appreciated by the masses, is usually that which offers little to no thought provoking ideas, nothing revolutionary, little profundity.  And as I read scene after scene after never-ending scene of sexually explicit, albeit rudimentarily written, sex acts, I wondered,  \\"How could a book with so many graphic sex scenes be so agonizingly boring?\\"

0307959856|1.0|I waited for 3 months to get this book from the library, and was immensely grateful that I had not spent any money on it. A major slog just to get through it. Too much information about every character, every place, every horse, everything. Attention to detail is one thing, but this just got so tedious. And I was amazed to find that I had read nearly 80% of the book and, even with all the everlasting detail, the story had not progressed at all after the initial death. Then, as if by magic, the deus ex machina reveals all just at the crucial moment. This was such a dreadful book. As a long time P.D. James fan, I was sorry to see it.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Pros: Really nice tin can<br />  Easy to install<br />  Worked straight out the box with lightning speed<br />  Provides a heatsink and a Fan<br />  Lock and Unlock Cores(You can use 2,4,6, or 8 cores)<br />  Easy to overclock<br />Cons: NONE<br /><br />I started building my computer and was either choosing the FX-6100 or FX-8120. It was hard but I chose to buy the FX-8120 because for $20 dollars extra, i was getting two extra cores. With two extra cores, it allows my computer to run a lot faster. You save a lot of money by buying this Fx-8120 because it will last you longer in terms of technology than the Fx-6100. You can also overclock it right out the box to match the same speed as the Fx-8150 and saves you a good $30 dollars.<br /><br />Would i recommend this? Of course, I recommend this to everyone that wants a fast computer and keep up with the technology. It is wallet friendly and speed is inbetween the i5 and i7. It is a cheaper than the i5 and i7 and it comes close to the i7 when overclocked.

B0086900TI|5.0|It seems like any teacher watching this film immediately hates it. They defend to the death their profession, saying kids aren't as bad as depicted in the film, and the teachers aren't as miserable. What they fail to acknowledge is that Tony Kaye didn't create this wonderful work of art to make a statement about the No Child Left Behind Act and all the flaws that lie within it.<br /><br />And yeah, what teacher, loving or hating their job, doesn't want to yell at a student at one point or another in their career? What student doesn't feel alienated at some point? This is all about the extremes that people can be pushed to, and how to either rise above it or sink into the depths of despair. Tony Kaye never disappoints, and he doesn't in this.<br /><br />In regard to the cast: Adrien Brody is a fantastic actor, with a slew of various titles and genres that give him depth and variety as well as adaptability, from the dark and dramatic thriller The Jacket, to the iconic action title Predators, as well as roles involving Sci-Fi Thrillers (Splice), romantic comedies (Brothers Bloom), Independent films like Wrecked, or the serious-minded Pianist, Brody doesn't shy away from change, and he never fails to accept it. That is evident in this role and Henry. The ensemble cast provides a decent structure, and they make a great grounding for Brody to stand upon and work off of. Nothing is wasted in the seconds of this film, and it is truly a masterpiece worth seeing.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While I did enjoy this book a lot it was not in par with the first two. I guess it's because they are now in District 13/The Capitol vs the usual settings and It had a different feel to it altogether. Still an enjoyable and one I would like to revisit one day along with the first two in the series.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this one even more than the original. The ending just left me wanting even more especially with the way the author ended it! Not what I was expecting when I first started reading it. I never thought that they would have to go back into the arena but it was all well played!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|My husband and I have been together for 7 years and know each other very well. We both have claimed to have put in much effort to make the other feel loved yet ironically, both of us have felt under-loved and underappreciated by the other. After reading this book, we have found that we are speaking our own love language to each other but it is not the love language of the other! Our love tanks are not full. After discovering what the others primary and secondary love language is using the assessment test, we have practiced giving heavy daily doses of the primary and sprinkkling in the secondary and little doses of the others. What a difference! It has been a big challenge for us as both our primary language is the other's very least needed! Wow. Talk about having to be intentional. But I can tell you it has been well worth it. The more I hold up to the challenge, the more he feels loved and wants to give me what I need. And vice versa. No wonder this is such a successful book. Apart from making God the center of of your marriage, this is one of the greatest foundations in a marriage - keeping your love tank full by speaking your mate's love language daily!

B006JJBFK0|5.0|I'm not trying to enter that mess, but I have always found Tarja rather weak vocally, always trying to be more than she is (I know this may get me crucified, but it's only my personal opinion [I only mention this because so many others have compared Neverworld's End to Tarja/Nightwish/Once]).  Manuela Kraller, on the other hand, is a wonderfully solid mezzo soprano.  The music is beautiful, on a breathtakingly enormous scale.  This, as others have said, is exactly what symphonic gothic metal should be.  The best I've heard.

0307951529|5.0|As a recent 2011 college grad working my way through my first corporate job, this book was a refreshing look into the very real possibility of running my own show in the future.  This book is not trying to teach you how to launch the next facebook (the author knows that those kinds of companies are a once a generation type things with a lot of luck, skill, and timing and is necessary).  Instead, he shares stories of how regular people (with or without formal education) can launch small businesses that are successful and personally--and financially--rewarding.  His thesis is essentially laid out on his 100startup.com website, but reading the stories and seeing the smaller details and intricacies of running a small business make this book a very enjoyable and enlightening read.<br /><br />As a curious reader, I would have enjoyed seeing more of the statistics and numbers somewhere at the end of the book/appendix since the author emphasized how much data he had collected over the course of writing the book.  However, I'm happy that he took the data and gives readers the \\"so what\\" during the course of the book.

B005IFWXWU|5.0|I bought this album the same day we went to see Hugh Laurie and the Copper Bottom Band live in Seattle, so maybe I am a bit biased, because the show was superb and completely exceeded my expectations! Hugh Laurie is clearly a multi-talented artist who can do no wrong and now he has turned his talents to the blues. Live, he comes across as an understated blend of English humor and humility, and his personality is apparent in this album too, which nevertheless doesn't suffer from it. True, he doesn't have the best voice - he is clearly upstaged in this album by Tom Jones - but he uses what he has very well to pay fitting and unpretentious tribute to the music of New Orleans. Best of all, he has assembled an amazing and talented group of musicians with an excellent selection of songs for them to perform admirably. Laurie is standing on the shoulders of giants to achieve this level of excellence - and there is nothing wrong with that when it works this well.<br /><br />Close your eyes and listen, you can almost taste the gumbo!
B001EBWING|5.0|This is a classic!! Everyone needs to see this movie! It's timeless! The actors are top notch!  Very well made!  Buy this for your collection!
B0086700CM|5.0|Like others I have been waiting for the kindle version of this fun, enjoyable game. I wasn't quite sure if this game would be made for the kindle, but I'm glad it was. The only complaint I have is the size of the game on the kindle. It's hard to position your hands in a comfortable way to play the game, but that's not the game's fault, it's the size of he kindle. Still fun to play.

B005EGXTEE|1.0|The first book in this trilogy asks us to accept a very disturbing premise, that is, a Game within a futuristic society which requires children to fight each other to the death.  I found this difficult to live with as I read the first two books but I was compelled to read on by the heroic and moral behaviour of the lead character.  She shone in this terrible world. However, the third book is a rushed, jumble of confused events where the characters are killed off or dispatched in a mad scramble to get to the last page and our heroine becomes a whining shadow of her former self.  Even the romantic plot fizzles out as the love triangle becomes a \\"make do\\" arrangement. Consequently the huge emotional investment that the reader must make in the original premise of the trilogy is simply not worth it.  It becomes a shabby cheap trick which left this reader wishing I had never gone to that dark place.

1451648537|4.0|I'm not a big reader of non-fiction.  While I find the concept of biographies and memoirs interesting, I often have a hard time getting into them.  Add to that the fact that the Steve Jobs biography is a hefty ~600 pages and I was a little intimidated by this book.  I picked up Isaacson's biography of Einstein a few years back and cracked the cover but never pushed through and finished it out.  This time I decided to persevere and read the whole book.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />As I thought about reviewing a biography, I realized that there is a fine line in reviewing the book itself versus reviewing the person who is the subject of the book.  The form and structure are intrinsically intertwined with the subject of the book in such a way that it's somewhat difficult to separate them in a meaningful way.  As a lover of story and narrative, it is more interesting for me personally to review and comment on the content of the writing as opposed to the writing itself.  But in doing this, my review would be more of a review of Jobs's life than a review of the book.  By the same token, the fact that this book is filled with so many interesting stories, anecdotes, quotes, etc is a testament to the painstaking efforts of the author.<br /><br />This book is the result of countless hours of research and interviews.  In most cases we are given the stories and information from a distanced perspective but there are numerous occasions where the author shares very personal experiences he had interviewing Steve Jobs or some of his friends and family.  Isaacson walks meticulously through Steve Jobs's life from birth to death.  He gathered information from publicly available materials and then dug deeper by finding the true story behind the details of the magazine articles, press conferences and web blurbs.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was a fairly public person so I already knew many aspects of his life and nature at least from a high level.  What I enjoyed in this book was that we were taken through Steve's life step-by-step in a way that let us see the formation of some of his quirks and mannerisms.  We saw how some of his behaviors and attitudes existed way back in his youth and childhood.  Even then, I'm sure there is plenty of information the author chose to leave out either due to space constraints (it is at the ~600 page mark already) or lack of complete/solid information, or just needing to keep a good flow.  In essence, this book is a series of stories throughout Jobs's life focused on many of the key highlights.  There are a few points where I noticed some chronological jumps where a little time was skipped, but I never felt like I was missing anything.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the fact that Steve Jobs was an active participant in this biography while still being \\"hands off\\" enough to not allow it to go through his \\"reality distortion filter.\\"  It was fun to read some of the more heated or interesting stories as told by other sources and then have a paragraph or two of commentary from Jobs giving his recollections of the situation.  Sometimes he challenged the way things happened.  Often he was willing to laugh at himself and acknowledge that things weren't perfect.  I also loved that he and his family/friends shared so many personal photos of Steve.  Granted, I would have loved to have seen more, but that's beside the point.  What actually would have been interesting (and something Jobs would have liked) would have been to see a \\"digital\\" appendix to the book filled with more photos as well as audio and video clips.  Something to take the 600+ paper product into a digitally exciting format.<br /><br />I felt like the chronological format of the book was well structured in that it gave us a logical framework with which to learn more about Steve as he learned more about himself as well.  That said, I was glad that each section was also willing to foreshadow (or blatantly comment on) the future that many of us are already very aware ofinstead of just \\"keeping it secret\\" until it happened through natural chronology.<br /><br />Another thing that I rather enjoyed was the way the Jobs biography became a biography of his companies as well.  In many ways, Jobs = Apple and Apple = Jobs.  There was a hiatus where Jobs was not part of Apple (and during his absence, the company floundered), but on a whole, Jobs was the personification of Apple and in many ways, Apple was a large scale representation of Jobs.  The same was true to a smaller degree with the other companies he ran such as Pixar.  That sort of melding of human<-->company makes you a little nervous for the company going forward, but it also makes you appreciate so much more of his passion and talent to create what he did.  As an Apple and Pixar consumer, I hope that both companies can continue with the same strength and creativity as they had under his leadership.<br /><br />The only thing that was a little unsettling to me was the swearing...especially the \\"f-bomb.\\"  I appreciate the need for accuracy but frankly I was a little surprised at how many of Job's quotes included swearing.  I know that swearing is part of our culture and that many people swear a lot.  Based on the amount of swearing done by Jobs in his quotes in the book, I have to come to the assumption that Jobs swears a lot.  Whether or not that's true, I don't know...but that's the perspective I gathered.  Based on the swearing, I would certainly caution younger or sensitive readers (though many would be turned off by the length of the book anyway).<br /><br />As a piece of literature, this is a very well written book that's jam packed with wonderful information and stories that came about through tons of passionate research.  As a story, this is an interesting and engaging read that provides great insight not only into the life of a single man, but also into a number of ideals, principles and practices that someone could look at in their own life when trying to find their ownpassion and goals for life.  Looking over Jobs's lifetime and the things he accomplished is inspiring, especially when broken down into its smaller parts as is done in this book.  It helps you realize that great things can be done by anyone with the right amount of passion and drive.  It will take a lot of hard work, but if you really want something bad enough, you'll be willing and ready to do the work required.  Just never give up.<br /><br />****<br />4 out of 5 stars
B00881VLCE|5.0|It is just like doing a puzzle on the kitchen table. What fun on the go! I love this app!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Just wow, this book is well written the plot is contructed to lead the reader along without answering to many questions or giving away to much. I wanted the characters to be my friends. This story has it all, love, mystery, fantasy, all while on a journey to find oneself. I love this book.
0812550757|2.0|Overall this is not the story of Ender Wiggen it is a story of someone else entirely. If you read Enders Game and you want more, this is not the book to read. I hope Card comes out with a book that does a huge twist and says this story was actually about a man with brain damage who thought he was Ender and the real Ender Wiggen is part of a new series that is actually exciting.<br /><br />The best analogy I can give is the difference between Enders Game and Speaker for the Dead is about the same difference between Lord of the Rings and Twilight.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I read the book in a few hours and it just makes such real sense that  as soon as I can I shall read it again and re-inforce the message and keep going with it. As it says, there are a few of us who may not actually lose weight but I live in hope. And if  I do not lose weight I have a Plan B.<br /><br />PLAN  B ...  I shall order more pall bearers
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Well written.  It keeps you interested and provides enough in-depth description that you can visualize the characters.  I ended up reading all three of the books.  Well worth the time and money.  I highly recommend these books.  Great read!

B005SFR7YE|3.0|It's a dream to see Ramin and Sierra in this over-produced experience, but even they can't save it from the wrath of video imagery.  ALW, get it through your head:  it's called theater for a reason.  Get rid of the videos you lazily depend on.  Whether in the West End or on Broadway, the live Phantom experience is reliant on its rich & ornate sets.  It's one of the reason Phantom is so successful.  The use of video in this production really cheapens the experience.
B007V80WUC|4.0|Since the inception of Circus Maximus, they have been a favorite band of mine that I kind of stumbled across.  The First Chapter was a solid debut, and Isolate put them into my daily rotation for the last five years.  I was very hyped to finally get my hands on the new release from this amazing band.  In regards to Nine, they have produced a very solid release, but after Isolate I think I was hoping for a bit more from this.<br /><br />Everything about this CD is solid from beginning to end.  The production is top notch, the musicianship is extraordinary, but there are not any songs that really stand out and make it anything more than a good release.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to any Circus Maximus fan as they are still a great band.  I just hope they don't make me wait five years for their next release!
B00499K9E0|5.0|I'm been an avowed Holmes fan for years.  When I heard of this show, I was alarmed and disappointed that after the amazing Jeremy Brett, someone could be attempting a new BBC Holmes, and then have the audacity to take it into the present day.  All such doubts were erased minutes into Season One, Ep 1, when Martin Freeman's lonely, rudderless doctor meets Benedict Cumberbatch's strangely fragile, needy genius and the show takes off like a rocket.  These two actors, combined with the remarkable writing/producing team of Moffat Gatiss and Vertue have created a world at once just like Doyle's and yet completely today.  I have now become an addicted fan and have watched all six episodes of this beautifully written show more times than I'm willing to admit.  If you have any doubts, put them aside and jump into this Sherlock.  You'll be glad you did.  Brilliant, funny, chilling, touching, sensational.  Television at its best.  Each hour and a half episode is really a movie and better than most you'll see in the theatre.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game. I enjoy playing it on my free time! I totally recommend it to does that like playing solitaire.
0385342063|4.0|Poppy Wyatt, Sophie Kinsella's newest heroine has the typical traits that most of Kinsella's characterizations have; she's a likeable somewhat ditzy working woman.  The story is predictable right from the blurb on the jacket; it's only a matter of time until the pieces fall into place as anticipated.<br /><br />It's that journey that makes this book so much fun to read.  Wyatt's mishaps are genuinely amusing.  The lack of a 5th star is only because the editor of this book should have been more on top of his/her game and trimmed it by perhaps 100 pages, as there's a lot of points where the book either drags or becomes redundant.  However, since its fast reading anyway, if you enjoy a light, amusing chick lit story, this is your book.  You'll be smiling.
B0086700CM|5.0|It has a lot of running and action. I would recommend this game to all gamers. I love it !!!!!
B0007TKNII|2.0|I'd love to leave a one word review in the form of my review title, but that's impossible.  Butler is a feast visually, but he does NOT have Michael Crawford's voice.  Emmy Rossum looks lost throughout the entire production.  Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson saved this otherwise lackluster production.
B007K3JCAE|1.0|I saw this movie in theatres and was more than satisfied with the sequel to the subplot of the first film. Walking out of the theatres I knew I would be purchasing the blu ray when it released. However, that was under the naive assumption it would come with a real digital copy. I was so disappointed when I saw UltraViolet copy next to the title, which like so many have already stated, is not really a digital copy at all. I liked the movie so much I pre-ordered it anyways, but just recently I came to my senses because it's not nearly worth the price as long as ultraviolet is attached to the product. I hope the distributors learn from our reviews because as big a movie collector as I am (300+), I will never purchase another movie with the words \\"UltraViolet digital copy\\" following the title.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|(4.5 stars) Set in a dystopian future, teenager Katniss and her friend Gale secretly hunt in the woods to help feed her family. After an uprising, the country has been divided into Districts, and as punishment, each district must provide two young people, one male, one female as tributes who must fight to the death in the Hunger Games. While each 12-18 year old has their name added once for each year, if they request extra food, their name will go in again. When Katniss' sister is chosen, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Along with Katnis, Peeta, a young man who showed her a kindness when they were starving after her father's death in the mines, is chosen. The story follows their seemingly doomed path towards and in the Game where they must not only use their physical skills but also be able to utilize the media attention to gain sponsorship in order to have a chance to survive. Peeta's feelings for Katniss are used by their support team to manipulate their chances. While the premise of the story is not necessarily new, the author does a wonderful job in bringing the emotional and moral challenges of the characters to the forefront and tells a dramatic, and page turning tale.

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Where to begin?  I saw the LON production on its closing night, and where most fans cried (some weeped) at the end of the musical, I found myself lamenting as well--but not for the characters' fates.  Rather, I found myself sending a short text message to my Phantom phriends & phamily: \\"Love SHOULD have died.\\"  The performances were incredible, with Ramin being 1 of only two Phantom's in my life--the other being, the untouchable Michael Crawford--but the sets were amateur-looking & ALW's dependence on video imagery was appalling.  I felt like if I was watching ALW's infamous phrase  when describing Phantom, \\"rock opera\\", on MTV with some fine voices thrown in there. The sets I could forgive when the singing started, but I could not tolerate the constant use of videos.  if I wnated to see videos, I could have watched played on the computer.  Phantom's deserved MUCH more than what seemed to be a hastily put together production with no cohesion.  As aforementioned, the cast was incredible--they really were too good for that somewhat scary production.<br /><br />Enter LND--the DVD.  I was NOT expecting anything good from this purchase, but being a Phanatic, I had to give it to the benefit of MY doubt.  From its start, I could just smell the proper production & vision.  Songs were rearranged with less dialogue, and voila:  here is Love Never Dies as it should have been directed and produced ALL along.  The cast was ok, with only Anna O'Byrne standing out.  I would have LOVED for the original cast to have stepped in for this production.  The actresses chosen for Madame Giry and Meg were less than mediocre in their roles.  I clearly remember Summer Strallen becoming a bonafide sensation in HER performance as Meg in the West End production.  Ben Lewis may be the perfect physical size for Phantom, but he doesn't have the star quality, vocal chops, or presence as RK or MC.<br /><br />One thing is for certain:  you get the full full spectrum of worst (Mercedes as Giry, that horror as Meg) to somewhat bearable (Lewis as Phantom) to excellent (the remaining cast and O'Byrne as Christine).rror as Meg) to somewhat bearable (Lewis as Phantom) to excellent (the remaining cast and O'Byrne as Christine).

B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you're at all interested in stories about the end of the world...read this book.  I've been reading things lately like Pure, Divergent, Ready Player One, Xenocide, Life as We Knew It  (and of course I saw Hunger Games)...and from two summers ago, The Passage.  I thought I might be getting tired of the genre but Hugh Howey writes a story that completely grabbed me from the first page.  You want to find out what is going to happen to these people.  I'm so glad I read the omnibus because I would not have been able to wait at the end of each story!!  And sometimes endings can be boring but this one is well done, I would say more but don't want to give anything away.  So glad I found this (thanks Entertainment Weekly).
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can you say about the classic MS style Solitare for Android App other than it works pretty much like the one you were use to while stealing time from the man with when you couldn't take any more! Other than small screen and sometimes touchy screen which is phones problem not app, it's a great little time waster once again, while you feel a need to be handling your smart phone or just plain feeling bored! The price was right too....Free! What more could you want, a sledgehammer and some rocks to smash?
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is highly addictive. it is easy to pick up and play but very hard to master. original and funny. try this game out - I guarentee you'll find space on your drive for it!

BANGA barks, howls, whimpers and rocks.

B002JCSRKC|5.0|I bought these boots when I got a summer job on a ranch in Wyoming... between the rain, mud, rivers, and horse dung everywhere, I needed a good pair of boots that were waterproof and comfortable to run around in all day. And hey, if they're adorable, that's just a bonus! I bought them in red, and they're perfect. They fit as I expected them to (I wear a 9 in sneakers, and got a 9 in these boots), and I can tuck my jeans in them easily.<br /><br />They were a little stiff around the ankles at first, especially when walking up and down stairs, but they've loosened as I wore them and are perfectly comfortable now. I even wear them on dry days, because they're so easy to clean off that any dirt and dust I get on them (and, of course, the horse poop) doesn't worry me at all!<br /><br />I always swore I'd never own a pair of Crocs, but these boots may change my mind! (And all of my co-workers who tried them on have immediately proclaimed that they need a pair of their own!)
B007PVHBHC|5.0|After eight years, the real Patti Smith is come back. Simple and beauty . Poems about one world that change every day but never disappear. The same group, the same sound but more personal, more confidential. Very close to the european culture, but  more powerful, more close. The album is full of reference to cinema (Godard, Tarkovsky, Maria Schneider or Antonnioni) and literature, Buljakov or Gogol, but don't be afraid the music is very simple to hear and excellent. Specials feelings are in each song and \\"Constantine's Dream is a good example of this.<br /> The special edition is beautiful, is like a poem book and also have  a extra track, \\"Just Kids\\"with a very good collection of photos in black and white, a very interesting commentary about each song and the circumstance around the origin of each composition. Is not a simple \\"new\\" Patti Smith CD, is something more, a compilation of feelings over the world in a travel with no end. Serenity and wisdom. A good music for special people to try to communicate something more that simples sounds. A great work.

0823015033|5.0|I originally bought this as an instruction book for my daughter, who has just started sculpting in polymer clay. Though I am not myself a novice modeling with clay, this book has taught me a great deal. Every single step, from choosing the right clay, to making your own tools, to making the armature, and sculpting the figure itself is broken down into easy, well illustrated (and often photographed) stages. Even if you are not planning to sculpt a human-like figure, there is much to learn from her step-by-step instruction. Throughout the book are time-and frustration- saving tips and tricks. Some very important (and often overlooked by the amateur) methods are detailed; like determining whether the clay is ready to hold its form correctly, ways to mark and measure out the proper portions to make each part, and how to properly blend one piece onto another. There are entire sections on details like fingers, fingernails, eyes, ears- and other difficult parts. She even demonstrates how to model different ethnicities and body types- including chubby and muscular ones! I'm blown away by the detail. This could be a college text in an art school. Highly recommended.
0312641893|4.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />I really love retellings--especially fairy tales and myths. So right off the bat, I knew that Cinder was right up my alley. Plus, it was a dystopian, sci-fi retelling of Cinderella, which sounded amazing. And, for the most part, my instincts about this book were right. Cinder was a fun, quick, and original retelling of the classic fairy tale. On this reimagined, futuristic Earth, increasingly strained political ties and disease wrack the population of New Beijing. The emperor is dying of the incurable plague that has run rampant across the world. A population grows restless, and a threat emerges from the Lunars, a race of evolved humans with unnatural abilities and a desire to dominate Earth and its peoples. Led by the evil Queen Levana, they search for the lost moon princess in order to kill her, while with the other hand attempt to supplant the young and green emperor's son, Kaito.<br /><br />The main character, Cinder, is an android: part human, part robot. As a result of this, she is treated as a second-class citizen by all who know of her condition, particularly her stepmother Adri, who uses her both as a breadwinner and housemaid. Right away, Cinder proves herself to be a strong, capable protagonist. Her rapport with the Prince, who comes into her mechanic shop looking to repair a robot, is witty and shows that even though she's attracted to him she knows what the real important things are, such as protecting her youngest stepsister. She is curious about the world around her and doesn't wait for other people to step in and fight for her. Cinder is impulsive and quite easy to identify with, despite having wires, a hybrid brain and neural network, and a prosthetic robot foot.<br /><br />The love interest, Prince Kaito, has swoon-worthy potential, but impressively the author Ms. Meyer deftly manages to let the romance take a backburner to the main plot, which is the threat of war between the Earth and the Moon. The setting has lots of interesting facets as well; the world Meyer introduces the reader to is fascinating, especially New Beijing. However, as always, I would have loved to have more details about this new Earth. We learn only peripherally about the culture and the current state of politics on Earth. I hope that in future book installments, a more rich description of Earth (and maybe the Moon as well!) will be present.<br /><br />I really felt like what the book lacked most was background, particularly background on the Lunars.

Despite this, I'm really looking forward to the next book, where hopefully all my questions will be answered.of interesting facets as well; the world Meyer introduces the reader to is fascinating, especially New Beijing. However, as always, I would have loved to have more details about this new Earth. We learn only peripherally about the culture and the current state of politics on Earth. I hope that in future book installments, a more rich description of Earth (and maybe the Moon as well!) will be present.<br /><br />I really felt like what the book lacked most was background, particularly background on the Lunars.

B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game! Ever since I started playing... I rarely stop!! I recommend this game to almost anyone!
B001TODCII|3.0|Liam Neeson..is a superb actor. There is no debate. FACT. But seriously, even the most well trained 'security\\" agent simply cannot ON HIS OWN, defeat an entire entourage of thugs. Would have been a little more realisiic if he had a partner working with him. I also notice a similiarity in this characters actions and kn owledge as a direct origin of the PERSON OF INTEREST lead character. There are a lot of things wrong in this film. the family he \\"loves\\" and is \\"saving\\" (his wife and daughter) are so spoiled you almos twant them to FEEL some pain of the real world. Very little information is given in this VERY brief 92 minute film of the true nature , organizational skills, methods, and sale destination of girls. Seems a very generic trip to the internet for 'facts. I personally know some young women overseas in Ukraine, latvia, who were trafficked last year. I even had a connection who COULD have helped but he swares \\"no such thing occured\\". The reality is scary, the film is actually fairly  UNscary byut the ACTION is TOP NOTCH. And that';s about all this has to offer. Forget deep emotions or political statements--this is a Super hero Film. Not a bad one.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this film starring some of the best of the United Kingdom's character actors. It has a well-told story, perfectly paced, with superb acting, much humor, and sentimentality. The theme is \\"everything turns out well at the end, and if it doesn't it is not the end.\\" Seven old men and women who have lost virtually all of their money and who are searching for some meaning in their life respond to a misleading advertisement that a hotel in India will give them an inexpensive and enjoyable stay, for it is the \\"best\\" and it is \\"exotic.\\" The seven find that they spent money they can ill-afford to spend for a run-down deteriorating hotel managed by a very likable but totally incompetent owner.<br /><br />The seven are a woman whose husband mismanaged their funds who just died leaving her poor with nothing to do; a husband and wife who invested in their daughters business and lost everything, he has a good and respectful approach to people and events, she is bitchy and satisfied with nothing; a man who is gay who betrayed his lover when he was young, who had no satisfactory life afterwards, and wants to return to India and see him; a woman who is searching for a rich husband; a man who wants to regain his potency and have sex and an on-going relationship; and a woman who was once a housekeeper who was fired because she is old, who is prejudiced against anyone who is not British.<br /><br />The young hotel owner is in love with a poor young woman. Neither his mother nor her brother wants the two to get married. His mother wants to close the hotel.

B0064X79JC|2.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did.<br /><br />I've never been so frustrated with reading a book than I was with 'Drive'. I found it extremely hard to follow and could never really \\"get into\\" it.. Sallis' short 2-5 page chapters may at first glance have you saying \\"Oh, great, this'll be a quick, easy read.\\" It may be quick, but it's far from \\"easy\\".<br /><br />Sallis constantly (and quickly) jumps around during his story, so you never quite know where Driver is at in his life or what's going on at a particular point. The movie did a much better job of making things flow together. I also feel that the short chapters and overall dull personality of Driver actually hurt the story much more than it helped, because there's no emotional investment of the reader. I never became, or got the chance to become attached to any of the characters, because everything moves along so fast, which really took the enjoyment down a notch for me. This disjointedness added to the difficulties I had in following the plot. Just when I felt I was getting a grasp on what was happening, a new scene or situation would be thrown at me before I had time to process what happened in the previous scene.<br /><br />Some people may like Sallis' style, but it's not for everybody. I enjoyed the movie a lot more. Not recommeneded unless you're a fan of non-linear noir stories.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I really tried to get through this boring, self-absorbed thing, but somewhere at mid-point I just said to myself 'enough already!'There are too many good books out there to waste my time! Don't waste yours.Its crap.
B004EPZ03Y|3.0|I always loved the Muppets.  I found this movie to be greatly disappointing.  There were a few good laughs but they were far apart and not enough.  An interesting thing - when the movie is paused, it goes to an \\"intermission\\" that changes every time it is paused.  I gave it a plus for that.  Many of the characters have a very brief appearance and don't have any real role.

B0037LXTUW|5.0|There's not much to say about this, it's just more cards to add to your Dixit game (which is one of the best social games ever), but they are great cards.  The art is just as good and as interesting as the original set of Dixit cards.  I heard something about color issues with the backs of the cards (that they were different than the original Dixit set), but they must have fixed this problem because my set's backs are identical to the original, so you can flawlessly integrate the two decks together and play Dixit with 150+ cards.  The two sets together barely fit into the original Dixit box, but they do as long as you don't care if the lid doesn't quite close down all the way.  I heard that Dixit Odyssey can hold Dixit 1 and 2 decks plus the Odyssey deck, so I'll probably get that eventually, but for now I'm happy with my new set of Dixit cards!
B007J6E9XC|5.0|This book is fantastic on so many levels-- the miraculous stories of the people who have benefitted from this research are the focus, but the reader will also be amazed at how the researchers battled their own course to uncover their findings. Also a practical treasure for people or family members of those suffering from learning disabilites, developmental disorders, or strokes. A gift!

B007JM4CWY|4.0|This puzzle game is fun and attractive for what it is, but is sorely missing features necessary to mitigate touch screen funkiness. I would recommend the ability to lock all currently filled/x'd cells, lock individual rows and columns. An input type selector may also be desirable rather than the multi-tap and hold methods.

B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Since the day of \\"Terminator\\" and its sequels, I have been baffled by linear story lines with the twist of time. And I watched \\"Terminator 2\\" all too often, looking for a clue to make sense but to no avail. On the other hand, \\"Groundhog Day\\" is a twist that I completely understand and sympathise. The idea of reincarnation as a dance a kindred spirit has been trying to get shows through. \\"Groundhog Day\\" is a collection of smaller movies done by the same person on the same day with a different outcome because of his previous (life) experience and knowledge before him. Separately each day makes little meaning. Together they make a world of difference, one that changes one's perception.<br /><br />More than a decade later came another collection of smaller movies called \\"The Lake House.\\" However, unlike the clean cut plot in \\"Groundhog Day\\", the micro stories inside \\"The Lake House\\" overlap one another. Their plots, too, are interwoven so much that we end up watching multiple movies at the same time. Therefore, although both \\"Groundhog Day\\" and \\"The Lake House\\" challenge their viewers to broaden their perspective, the latter asks more from the viewers: a prior knowledge of \\"Persuasion\\", and a multi task of watching three or four stories going on at the same time.<br /><br />\\"The Lake House\\" works with a lasso of time, whose points wave back and forth casually. The director uses a dog called Jack skillfully to plot these micro stories apart. Jack is male in Kate's story, female in Alex's, and she disappears into the woods as a cue for their separation in the end. There are three tragedies and one comedy in \\"The Lake House\\", the way I see it. The first tragedy is Kate's reunion with Morgan after two years' living in the Lake House, a split image of her mother's marriage to her father. The second is Alex's knowing too much ahead and searching too deep. Death came as a result. The third is of course bad timing. Towards the end we witness a perfect couple growing apart because they are short of two years. It reflects the love stories with lines like, \\"I wish I met you back then\\", or the like.<br /><br />Also towards the end, a twist of plot recovers the same couple from ashes of time and thereby works out a different ending, a happier ending than that of \\"Groundhog Day\\" in my opinion. The Lake House is a stage, the movie is a light romance. However, it is more enlightening to me than the other time twisters I've watched for the past two decades!<br /><br />Footnote: I just found out this movie is a remake of Il Mare. [[ASIN:B0002LI2LQ Il Mare (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]se they are short of two years.

B006RUJST6|5.0|At first, the connection between the main characters seemed unbelievable, but the development of that connection brought it all together.  I very much enjoyed this novel!
0345803485|1.0|I LOVE reading.  I love a good book.  Fifty Shades of ANYTHING are not good books.<br /><br />I was bored out of my gourd through book one...but like the title says, I am not a quitter.  I reluctantly started book 2, which was slightly better than one, but it is also the one that started to bother me from a psychological standpoint. One does not need to be borderline personality disorder to enjoy and appreciate the finer aspects of BDSM.  To suggest that he was 'cured' after engaging in a relationship with the heroine (book 3) is to suggest that there is something wrong with the practice in the first place.<br /><br />The writing was contrived. I ended up skim reading to the part where they cry out each other's names in unison as they climax so I could get back to the story and I could END this series.  If I read one more time how she 'bit her lip' or that they referred to each other as Mr. Grey or Ms. Steele,..well I was ready to throw my Kindle against the wall.<br /><br />This is a slightly naughty, thoroughly lame, schoolgirl fantasy whereby a 21 year old is swept off her feet by a super rich, amazingly gorgeous, sadistic megalomaniac that needs fixing...just the type of fixing she can handle. Rich men are seldom that gorgeous or that young...convenient.  Usually the major attraction to a rich man is the size of his wallet and how far he will open it for the gold digger du jour. Great if you like that kind of thing.  I prefer substance, in my reading and my life, something this book lacks.
0307730697|5.0|Ever since I saw the movie 'Navy Seals' with Charlie Sheen I have been curious about the Navy Seals and what they do.  Because they are created to be secretive in nature it's difficult to really get an idea of what these brave Americans do, we only have Hollywood to get any clue.  One of the secret units in the SEALs, one of their elite units is named SEAL Team Six, which has only recently been confirmed by our government because of the raid on Osama Bin Ladden.  Incredibly these soldiers continue to take on the most difficult job, without much recognition or reward for risking their lives.  Eric Blehm's book Fearless dives into the life of one such Navy SEAL who has given his life for our freedom.<br /><br />Adam was something special from the moment he was born.  He had no quit in him, was fearless, and basically immune to pain.  Throughout his high school and college career he lived his life on the edge of crazy from jumping out of moving vehicles over bridges to standing between his friend and loaded a shot gun.  Adam demonstrated his character through adversity, going from warrior to joker in seconds, getting hurt on missions, losing his eye to training exercises and of course, his dark battle between college and the Navy with drugs.  Adam Brown was a warrior and ended up laying down his life trying to protect his friends.<br /><br />Overall this is a great story about courage, honor, and faith.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that serve or served in the military, anyone that is trying to climb out of the darkness of drugs, or anyone who likes a good story.  This book is a great reminder of those soldiers who willing give up their comfort, families and lives to protect our freedoms.  If you read it you will love it!<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing

B0064NTZQ2|2.0|I love the old 70's movie \\"The Driver\\" starring Ryan O'Neal, who plays a stoic character with unbeatable driving skills. Within the first few minutes of this movie, I thought this movie with Ryan Gosling was going to be something similar. Well, it started off promising enough, then starts getting more and more farfetched by the minute! As it turns out, Gosling's character is a movie stunt driver by day and robbery getaway driver by night. OK, interesting enough. But all of a sudden, he turns into this unstoppable Jason Bourne-esque Terminator who can take out any hardened mob soldier with a flick of the wrist--SUP-ER-MAAAAN! Come on! I don't think it's too realistic that some stunt driver can single-handedly wipe out an entire flank of the mob!<br /><br />He goes on this killing spree (at least he's wiping out bad guys, I'll give him that) without so much of a blink of an eye, as if he has no emotional psyche whatsoever. So it's kind of ironic that he does all this because he LOVES the girl and his kid so much--weird. *SPOILER ALERT*...OK, so he's doing all this killing (with the experience and skill of a well-trained killer, which in the beginning of the movie, there is no indication of such skills) in the name of love, but then he just ups and leaves her anyway. OK, he didn't want any future trouble following him to affect the girl and her kid. But how can this be a worry? He's SUPERMAN! At the end he gets stabbed in the gut with a huge knife by a mobster who has extensive experience in killing people, who of course Gosling's character has no trouble in killing in return. AND THEN HE JUST WALKS OVER TO HIS CAR AND DRIVES AWAY! HUH?? Boy, he's in the wrong business...he should be working for the military as their secret weapon, indestructible one-man army! If the movie had gone on any longer, it would have turned into the Speed Racer cartoons where Speed's car plummets off a cliff, crashes, explodes, and Speed just walks away, without a scratch, hair neatly combed...lol! *END SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />So I liked the acting in this movie, but the story just got too farfetched for me. THUMBS DOWN.
0205313426|5.0|I had read in a number of places that this book was da-bomb (in this case da-bomb of appropriate written style and punctuation). And indeed it is.<br /><br />This book is densely packed with guidance, pointers and commands, so much so that it is difficult to believe how small it is. Not only that, but in places it is laugh-out-loud funny! Just me? I reckon not, as the dry humour is bound to appeal to others (maybe not many, but I know you exist!)<br /><br />If you're interested in the craft of writing, or need to up your game at this worthwhile pursuit (as I do), then check this little book out.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I bought this because my son says it's the best movie he's seen on Net Flicks.  Nonetheless, I love a good suspense/sci-fi story and this fits the bill.  Moves fast, entertaining with a great story line. DeNiro is great (as a big player on Wall Street) and Cooper does a good job portraying the ordinary guy who after taking NZT (brain enhancement drug), finds himself an instant genius, with a Midas touch! The women, the fast cars, the fame and the millions made in days (playing the stock market, etc). Of course there's the downside (what happens when he runs out), mixed with the dangerous drug dealer who wants not only his front money but an endless supply of the same drug!  A lot of action, great effects, and if course who wouldn't love the color of Brad Cooper's neon blue eyes (on NZT)!<br /><br />The ending is perfect - Definitely worth watching!

0753801728|4.0|The Reader written by Bernhard Schlink is a historical fiction book about a young boy that falls in love with a woman who is double his age.  When the story starts it explains how the main character, Michael Berg, meets a middle aged women when she helped him when he was sick one day.  Once Michael is better he goes back to thank the women, Hanna, and from that moment on his life is never the same.  Michael falls in love with Hanna and her womanly confidence but one day she oddly vanishes.  Despite his efforts to move on, Hanna is always on the back of Michael's mind until one day when she randomly reappears.<br />I would reccomend this book to someone that likes a story with twists.  The story is short and very well written, it is an easy read.  I liked that the book was based on historical events.  The Reader is a love story with a wicked twist that you never even see coming.
B0051UH6YM|4.0|I read this book immediately after finishing Strunk and White's 'Elements of Style'; the topics covered are the same, but in terms of narrative style these are two very different books! While Strunk and White lay down the law in succinct commands Truss has a very readable almost conversational style. I enjoyed - and would recommend - both.<br /><br />Truss is clearly very passionate about punctuation: her encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject and her numerous personal anecdotes attest to this. Her ability to articulate and express her feelings so clearly on the page adds weight to her call for the correct application of written English, with all its attendant twirls and twiddles.<br /><br />If you are looking to improve your written style (as I am), or have a passing curiosity in the English language, you could do worse than pick up this playful panda pun parcel of prose on the perils and pleasures of punctuation.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game is enjoyable and addictive.  The only drawback is that certain aspects of the game costs real money.  A lot of money in fact...  Gameloft needs to fix this:(.
B003Y5H5EW|1.0|I know that there is an audience for films like this but I am not one of them. I have only watched the first and second in this series and found them to be pleasant time wasters. In this one however I could not get beyond the idea that our heroine in this version is nothing but  a mass murderer who deserves to be put down despite the sexy skintight leather she wears. Sorry fans, but the humans are the good guys and the vamps and lycans are nothing but killers that deserve to be eliminated from the world. 'Underworld: Awakening'  is pure action from beginning to end and lacks any story, pathos, romance, sympathy, or vampire/lycan mythology that made the originals so interested. The CGI is obvious and uninterested from the fake cloud of steam that hides a naked Kate Beckinsdale to the less than interesting lycans. This leaves us with a 3D bloodfest which is why I guess 'Bloody-Disgusting.com' loved it so much. My thumbs are down - way down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think these games are very fun and addictive.....Easy to understand and play. Games you can play with the whole family.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Having seen this movie several times, I would say that it seems to get better with age. Tom Hanks does an outstanding job with this character. His timing, facial expressions and heart of gold shine throughout the film. I'd seen it so many times, it was time to own my own copy and I'm glad I do!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Being an avid reader I always find romance novels to be my least favorite, but this book is now going into my favorite books ever pile. The characters are interesting and relatable. I decided to read this book because it was recommended after I finished reading the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, after reading those I thought they would be hard to top in the romance category but this is way up there. I hope that the author decides to continue with these characters to another novel...and fast!
B003XDVUEG|5.0|I loved these Crocs. This is the first pair of many that I'll buy from now on. These are very comfortable, fresh and soft shoes, and it doesn't mean that they wont be cute and trendy. I was worried about the size, because I had read that they were bigger than the size specification, but in the end they fit perfectly (I wear 38 in Venezuela and I bought them 8 sized). I definitely recommed this model!

B0059XTTW8|4.0|I am not surprised by all the 1 star reviews. This is a movie one must actually watch, listen to and REMEMBER what has happened to \\"get\\". Boy... that's a rare thing in films these days. No going out for snacks or time for texting with this one.<br />But I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 because, I must admit, if I didn't already know the characters, plot, twists and jargon from watching and loving the miniseries, I think I would've been lost.<br />The film is full of top notch performances and also full of great movie making... y'know where an image or an action that seems nonchalant or off the cuff is actually very telling to the story and character. (like the men all swatting at a bee in the car...all but cool master spy George Smiley who merely lowers a window and the bee flies out.... a 15 second telling moment you'd miss if you weren't involved in the film, but texting or snacking instead).<br />So there are many many good things in this film that brings the real dreadfulness of the Cold War back to life for those who may not remember or who weren't there. But the complexity calls for the miniseries format, and we have it thus with an equally masterful cast and script, so I suggest you all check out the miniseries.

B000JML7EC|4.0|I read this book in my childhood and was happy to revisit it when it appeared on Kindle.  I think the book is quite good and the adventure within really captures the imagination.  Obviously that's true or we wouldn't still be talking about it.  I also think it's an easy read.  As an adult, I can't rate it quite as highly as I did as a child, but this is still a wonderful book.<br /><br />The edition itself is excellent too, especially for a free book.  I love that these are out there so people can read the classics.  Thank you!
0345803485|1.0|Ackkk, SKIP THIS ONE, such terrible writing, sentence structure, use of words, repetativeness - who did the editing? Words misspelled, missing and /or used improperly!

1401235417|3.0|I had heard a lot about how great this was, and from his work on American Vampire, and most of his Detective Comics run, I was inclined to believe it. The actual experience was a little disappointing.<br /><br />The story is at least a little hampered by having to be an introduction to the new Batman status quo, as well as the introduction to a new set of villains. It's actually kind of slow-moving for a book that can be breezed through in the better part of an hour if you aren't in a hurry. Snyder introduces an interesting take on Bruce Wayne's role in improving Gotham, making him as active in improving the city as Batman is in saving it from destruction.<br /><br />The main problem for me is the new group of villains introduced, the Court of Owls. Owls, at least as a totem to base the entire visual design of your ancient conspiracy on, aren't quite as... intimidating as Snyder wants them to be, which leads to some overcompensation regarding the power of the Owls as a group, leading to the revelation that the Court of Owls has basically controlled Gotham since its formation. There'a also a sharp contrast between the more grounded tone of Snyder's stories and the men in owl suits who are the evil masterminds behind what is perhaps the DCU's biggest and most economicially important city.<br /><br />This whole business with the Owls really draws comparisons to the more recent parts of Grant Morrison's run on the Batman titles, as artistically bipolar and scattered as it may be. It's especially reminiscent of the endgame of the Batman and Robin section of his Bat-epic, where it's revealed that Dr. Hurt, with the aid of Darkseid, has similarly futzed around with history, and specifically Gotham history. This, combined with the recent Batman Inc's Leviathan conspiracy, makes it almost impossible to keep from comparing Snyder's stories to Morrison's, and Snyder definitely is on the wrong side of that seesaw. Of course, it's a little cruel to compare a person who's been a powerhouse since at least the late Eighties, with his groundbreaking Doom Patrol and Animal Man runs, to someone whose first published comics work was just about 3 years ago; but given the similarities in their current Batman stories, it's pretty much impossible not to. You'd have to be... I'd almost make a \\"blind as a bat\\" pun here, but it would most likely offend both the blind and those with a workins sense of humor.<br /><br />But it's not all unoriginal and clumsy, as Greg Capullo's astoundingly expressive art would make him one of the major artistic breakout stars of the DC relaunch... if he hadn't had a long career working with Todd McFarlane on Spawn, who just happens to be a dark, brooding character dressed all in black with a long, flowing cape and a deliberately frightening appearance. But nevermind that he seems to have taken a crash course in drawing a pitch-perfect Caped Crusader,Capullo's art is still astounding. It's really great at creating a creepy, paranoid atmosphere as well as making conversation scenes interesting with his mastery of facial expressions, whether it's a playful, Groucho-Marxian Commissioner Gordon or a half-crazed Batman. And FCO's coloring is bleak when it's necessary, but never muddy or ugly. More comics should have art and coloring like this. The lettering is... not spine-shattering, but still readable and doesn't interfere too much with the mood, and it really says something about how bad the lettering in mainstream comics can be that that's what makes for a compliment.<br /><br />This is not the worst Batman comic you could buy. This is not even the worst Batman comic coming out now. In fact, it's probably the second best, after Morrison's Batman Incorporated. But for me, second best just isn't good enough.powerhouse since at least the late Eighties, with his groundbreaking Doom Patrol and Animal Man runs, to someone whose first published comics work was just about 3 years ago; but given the similarities in their current Batman stories, it's pretty much impossible not to.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the book. Mostly enjoyed how the chapters went back and forth from past to present. Kept it interesting and the ending was never expected.
B002HFP0QU|3.0|The titles of the songs in CD1 were written in chinese or korean or ???. I cannot figure out what songs unless I listen to them. Vendor should exchange this CD.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Against my better judgement, I saw this in the theater and my wife had to keep squeezing my hand to keep me from shouting out \\"oh come on!\\" countless times.  As others have stated, this movie is absolute historical fantasy - there is NOTHING historically accurate in this movie except that the U.S. did have black pilots and they did participate in WWII - aside from that, pretty much everything in the movie is absolute rubbish.<br /><br />The story is BAD, the acting is BAD, the computer graphic work is HORRIBLE, and the script may very well be the WORST bit of work ever written about the American Air Force in WWII.  The technical advisor on this movie must've been Lady Gaga.<br /><br />These guys deserve a much better movie than this - this is absolutely painful to watch if you know anything at all about WWII or aviation in general.  The events portrayed in this film DID NOT happen, 98% of what is shown is pure fiction.  Somebody should do a good quality movie about these men.  The made-for-television version done years ago, as poorly done as it was, was infinitely better than this.  If you think \\"300\\" is an accurate depiction of the 300 Spartans at the Battle of Thermopale, then you'll likely think this movie is historically accurate too.  The only problem with this comparison is that \\"300\\" was actually an entertaining movie, despite being fictional, whereas this film is just plain terrible.  Avoid this one at all costs.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The movie was visually stunning and depending on the price, I would definitely like to own this on blu-ray. Hemsworth and Theron were amazing in their roles as well as Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins but...they could have cast anyone but Kristen Stewart. I wanted to like her in this--I really did. I put Twilight behind me and was hoping she'd redeem herself. Except it was like watching Bella all over again. The same three facial expressions and mannerisms that plagued Twilight also plague this movie. She did not appeal to me as the rising underdog to overcome the hardships she'd faced. And in no way was she fairer than Charlize Theron. They would have done much better to cast an unknown.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Incredible. I can't remember the last time I read a book that was so riveting. My little boy read this book first and I remember thinking to myself, \\"That book sounds brutal\\" when he would give me a little taste of the action.<br /><br />The writing style is intense, but easy to read. The pace is VERY quick. It was one of those books I literally stayed up late to read and got up early to read until I was done.<br /><br />I had a couple of friends that came over this weekend and they mentioned they couldn't read it because they heard about the brutality involving kids. And yes, it's violent, but I this book is so artfully crafted that if that's a concern, you'll quickly get so drawn in to the story that you'll be glad you gave it the time and attention it deserved.<br /><br />This book (and series - I've read them all), is excellent. After reading it, I feel better about my young teenage son reading it because we were able to discuss it.<br /><br />I know this is suppose to be a review on the book, but I must add that the movie was excellent and did the book justice.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|My son told me I might like this book. I had no idea what it was going to be about, only that it was sci-fi. After reading the first part, I couldn't put it down. The writing is exceptional. It is a fascinating look into human nature and keeps you believing in the basic goodness of people.
0439023491|5.0|I didn't want to read these books because the premise was just too depressing, and I didn't need any of that in my life; but my friends convinced me to read it. I am so glad that I read these books. They take the very real possibility of an almost communist/dictatorship controlling all the people to a new level. It is disturbing and heart warming, but it is so interesting I couldn't put it down. Truly a great story with characters you can't help but fall in love with. I would recommend this book to anyone with a sense of adventure and anyone who loves reading about the underdog using sheer intelligence to make it through even the hardest life and death situations.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|This movie is very refreshing, intimate, and romantic in the most basic sense of the word.  It deals with coming to grips with those first feelings and truly expressing them to someone!  Great! You need to see BOTH movies....see the sequel.

0307730697|3.0|\\"Fearless\\" is the biography of an unlikely hero, Adam Brown, who died March 17, 2010 in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan when SEAL Team 6 stormed a \\"hornets nest\\" hunting a Taliban leader.  In that fire fight, Adam Brown would sustain several gunshot wounds, and his heroic comrades would risk life and limb to try to save their fallen brother.  Sadly, their efforts were unsuccessful.<br /><br />Author Eric Blehm undertook the endeavor to interview friends, family, and comrades of fallen Adam Brown and write his biography.  Those closest to him described Brown as fearless, a warrior long before he was ever a Navy SEAL.  That description provided the title for Blehm's biography: \\"Fearless\\".<br /><br />Before I say what I didn't like, I'll tell you what I DID like: the last 50 pages.  Not because Adam Brown died; that part was horrible.  In fact, I knew he died before reading the book, but as I read I still expected him to survive, as if the book was able to rewind time.  What I liked was his and his team's heroism.  They each gave all they had, and in the end Adam Brown died courageously.  I liked the last 50 pages becase that's when the pace of the story finally picked up and grew into something captivating.<br /><br />Quite honestly, when I pick up a book about Navy SEAL's, Delta Force, or Green Beret's, etc, I want to read about their courage under fire, their heroism in those circumstances where 99% of us would buckle.  I want to read about their \\"super-human\\" valor, what distinguishes them from me.  I read them because it makes me wonder if I could or would do the same thing in the same situation.  It's what makes men like Adam Brown and his comrades special!  Their stories inspire me to courage, and that's what the final 50 pages gave me.<br /><br />That said, I thought \\"Fearless\\" was relatively boring for the first 15-or-so chapters.  I say \\"relatively\\" because I compare it to autobiographies written by former SEAL's Marcus Luttrell (\\"Lone Survivor\\"), Howard Wasdin (\\"SEAL Team 6\\"), and Chad Williams (\\"SEAL of God\\").  Those books were page-turners from the get-go.  Unfortunately, this one wasn't.  Readers have to sift through the preliminaries of Adam's troubled life to get to the action at the end of the book.  I understand why Blehm had to write about Adam's troubles, because they shaped him into who he was as a person, and his personality defined how he would behave as a SEAL.  I don't imagine writing a biography is an easy task, since no story is ever quite as interesting as it is when it's told first-hand.  Second-hand stories just lack emotion and bite.  That's what the first 200 pages gave me.<br /><br />What I also liked about \\"Fearless\\" was the brutal integrity of language.  I thought I'd never see the day when a Christian author writing for a Christian publisher would use curse words in his language.  Blehm interviewed people, and he used their words in their vernacular.  It's not that I need vulgarity and crass language in order to like a book, but it takes away from a book's (or movie's) reality when authors change hard-hitting phrases into powder-puff language, like, \\"Gol darnit all\\" or \\"Hey, you turkey.\\"  It's just not the real world, and Blehm scored big points with me for not editing the words -- albeit crass -- Adam Brown's loved-ones used.<br /><br />I can't read a book like this and walk away from it unchanged.<br />I can't help but ask myself, \\"Could I have achieved what Adam Brown (or other SEAL's) achieved?\\"  \\"Would I have responded similarly in the hostile situations they face on a daily basis?\\"<br />\\"How will I react under fire in my duties as a police officer?\\"<br />\\"How will others describe me at my funeral?  Courageous? or Coward?  Man of God? or Man of Compromise?\\"<br /><br />If not for the conclusion, \\"Fearless\\" would have been floppy.  I give Blehm kudos for wrapping the book up well and instilling much-needed emotion into its conclusion.  Sadly, I wanted to skim throught the first 80% of it to get to what the book was really about.  Therefore, I give this one only 3 1/2 stars.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't in the \\"great\\" category either.  Adam Brown's life-story was tremendously victorious; the book simply lacked a great beginning and middle.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this book free of charge from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers (\\"Blogging for Books\\") in exchange for my unbiased review of it.

0307716546|5.0|This is a bittersweet story of the lengths to which a mother will go to protect her children.  Grace is at sports day at her 4-year-old son's school and her daughter, 18-year-old Jenny, is a teacher's assistant working as a nurse at the school that particular day.  A fire erupts and everybody is outside the school except for Jenny.  Grace rushes inside to rescue Jenny.  She manages to pull her out, but they both end up unconscious at the hospital.  Grace finds herself outside her body looking at unconscious self and soon meets up with Jenny who is also outside her body.  The two of them try to figure out who set the fire and whether it was a deliberate action against Jenny.  Someone had been sending Jenny hate mail in the past and Grace thinks that the fire may have had to do with the sender of the hate mail.  This was an extremely well-written book--one of the kind where you just don't want to put it down.  It was heartfelt and beautiful.  I highly recommend this book.
0385336810|4.0|WOW!!  I've heard from so many people (ok, women) that I need to read Sophie Kinsella's books.  Finally after hearing about it from my hair dresser I took the plunge.  I bought Can You Keep A Secret and I'm not kidding, 10 pages in to the story I was laughing out loud.  Loudly!  Emma is such a likable and well rounded character.  Her interactions with friends, family and most of all the stranger on the plane at the beginning of the book are all so endearing.  If I had one negitive it would be that even though I'm new to this author and the story was well paced it was pretty predictable.
0345803485|1.0|This book is so boring it compelled me to write my first review.<br /><br />A coworker described this book to me and it sounded interesting, especially since it was a \\"best seller\\".<br /><br />It started off promising and quickly it became the most boring, repetitive book. Every chapter is identical to the previous one. Initially, the sexual twist was why I wanted to read the book but that is all the book described over & over & over & over! It became so boring. The thrill of erotica was ruined by the constant  repetitiveness. A total disappointment. I was really looking forward to reading this book. I kept telling myself to be patient and hopefully the storyline would have some kind of climax. It never happened. There was never a high peak in the story. I'm shocked this book is so popular. A waste of money & time.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I made it through two-thirds of the book and just couldn't continue anymore, which is exceedingly rare for me. As someone who has loved Richard Ford's previous books, I couldn't wait to read this--and felt bitterly disappointed. I would never have guessed this was written by the same author. It has little insight (other than that parents' actions affect their children--oh, really? I didn't realize.), and there's next to no plot. Literally. The main character is completely passive. The most I ever felt for him was minor sympathy because of his rotten parents, who are drawn much more vividly but in excruciatingly repetitive fashion. The reader is hammered over the head with the same descriptions of their marriage and their faults.<br />In addition, although I'm fine with books with serious and thought-provoking themes, this one was simply bleak, with no hope of escaping. The only way I finally could was to stop reading. I'll be reluctant to ever read Ford's books again, sadly.
1416589473|5.0|I found this book interesting. It did a nice job of showing off the newer world and helped set the stage for Guild Wars 2. It featured a lot of information and back fill, some chapters where heavier than others, but it didn't seem to unload it too quick either. It shows many aspects of the world, several of which have changed noticeably from the first game. There were even some references to characters from Guild Wars 1, usually to show what they did after the game's story ended. The story itself was good and would have been worth reading even if it weren't set in Guild Wars. The characters featured a nice range of personalities and gave the reader a good feel for the different racial backgrounds of the 5 playable races in Guild Wars 2. The only thing that could have improved the story would be an epilog to better sum up the results of the ending. It is hard to explain why without spoiling the plot.<br /><br />I'd say this book is a must buy for any Guild Wars player who enjoys Fantasy Books. If you enjoy Fantasy books and don't play Guild Wars, you'll probably enjoy it as well.

0765350386|5.0|As a writer, Mistborn (the Trilogy) changed my understanding of plot structure. It begins with a snap and then branches and keeps branching and weaving back on itself with remarkable subtlety. Fabulous character development, thrilling world-building, and one of the most solid magic systems I have ever encountered. No mystic wands that can do the ever-unlimited Magic Spells. This story is handled expertly. Sanderson gives the world its definition and then forces it to work under those limitations, struggling and thinking its way through every new obstacle. Mistborn cannot disappoint.<br /><br />As a reader, Mistborn satisfied every promise it made from start to finish. The only criticism worth mentioning is that there is a single point in the trilogy where the tense visual fades. The imagery (I will not ruin the scene) becomes too abstract for me to appreciate it. But I can forgive a single scene after a laudable tale. I know when to admit I've been enchanted, and this is it readers and writers. That cynical little voice in my head that \\"always knows what is going to happen\\" soon learned to keeps its mouth shut. What made it so amazing was that the story turned in places where you wouldn't expect it to, but ended up making more sense than if it hadn't, or would turn when you expected but not in the same direction. Full points.

Seriously, this is some of the worst, corniest dialog you will ever hear in a movie theater. I cringed every time someone opened their mouth. Only need to watch this one if you have a serious P51 thing.
0307341550|2.0|I started out liking this book, but I got a bit tired of the far-fetched parts. The 13-year-old half-sister was a caricature, no one acts like that. The \\"heroine\\" had spent many years carving words into her skin because of her supposedly bad childhood, but it didn't sound all that bad to me. The death of the other sister was *supposed* to be a mystery but wasn't. But I REALLY lost patience when Camille starts taking drugs with her 13-year-old half-sister. Seriously? You are enabling a minor by letting her take drugs, and you're JOINING her? At that point, I no longer cared what happened to Camille.

B007U8UBGI|5.0|The best album so far this year. Ya boy Jack white is in top form. And maybe America's best right now. Can't stop playing it.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Every once in a while, a film comes along that helps put things in perspective. Act of Valor does a fantastic job of showing the gritty world that is the life of a Navy SEAL and the work they do for all of us. The choice to use those who are the real deal and on active duty, was a wise one. It is a great film that should be viewed with a sense of pride. It deserves 5 stars and a salute.<br /><br />- Charlie Morgan<br />Best-Selling author of Sticks And Stones
B0086700CM|5.0|I was waiting forever for this game to come out . I love it so much its so addicting.I play it all the time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is pretty cool. I like how it has puzzle packs available to download for free. the artwork in some of those puzzles is breathtaking. I also like how u can choose how many pieces u want the puzzle to be. I find this game both entertaining and visually wonderful. if it wasn't the FAOTD I would have gladly paid for this app. Very cool indeed! bravo XIMAD INC. ;-)
B002ZG99IG|4.0|its great movie i hope everyone gets it. she crazy as hell im glad im not in collage cuzz if i dont want crazy mess happening
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app for the kindle fire?!?!?!?!?!?! I am soooooo happy they finally made this game for the kindle I was jealous my friends had it for there gaming devices and now I have it to! even though it says you need real money you could play to get coins and buy stuff which won't be hard because this game is addicting&trade;
B007JM4CWY|4.0|If you like sudoku, you'll probably like this. It's similar but different enough for someone who's a little tired of sudoku. Simple graphics, good interface, stable on my Galaxy S II (T989).
B001VNB54A|1.0|Band of Brothers, in my opinion, was one of the best works to ever grace a television set.<br />The Pacific is not even worth watching.  I quit halfway through.<br /><br />The cinematography of this series is the only redeeming quality.  However, this does not make up for the complete lack of a plot.<br /><br />Whereas Band of Brothers used graphic violence only as a means to provide some understanding of the anguish the soldiers went through.  This series uses graphic violence as a novelty.  Then there are the episodes where absolutely NOTHING happens.<br /><br />Once again, Band of Brothers was amazing.  Furthermore, my grandfather fought in the Pacific, so I also had personal reasons to anticipate this series.  I was let down.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game a long time now and very pleased that android got it. this game is really fun and easy... well for me it is. I hope the people who got this are exited!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it so freaking much!!! I love it I am 100% addicted to it i recomend it to every single person i know!
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad they have temple run for my Kindle Fire. I've played this game on just about everything else but the Kindle Fire. I'm so happy now.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have played this game before on friend's devices, it worked great! When I tried to play on my Motorola DROID 3 the game play skips around, often catching up just in time to show me doing a George of the jungle dive right into a root, or off the ledge.  I know it is possible for the game to run smoothly, what's the deal?
B0086700CM|5.0|super fun. really addicting. lots of objectives that make u wanna keep on playing!!!!  you should deffinetly get this game
B007U1FEJE|5.0|To start with, the 1st and the last 3 songs are as good as anything the Boys have ever done and alone make this a must have album. Unfortunatly the rest of the songs aren't up to those lofty standards. The single while still very very good is something of a step down,sonding like it could have been someplace between the Beach Boys 85 & Keepin' The Summer Alive albums. Some of the other songs take a while to grow on you. Secret Life... is one song that I initially didn't like but found after several listenings I couldn't get it out of my head. I would have liked them to have included the remake of \\"Do It Again(0n the the \\"Fanzine\\" best of CD & the very expensive Japan release of the \\"That's Why God\\" album)and the Tsunami relief single from last year \\"Don't Fight The Sea\\" which is availabe on Al's solo album but would have sound great here as well. In fact they do. along with \\"Waves Of Love\\" from Al's album, as the copy I made to listen to in my car (yes, I did buy the CD & pre ordered the vinyl edition & didn't download this for free & bought Al's fine album as well) has both the songs & they fill the album out nicely. None of this is to say any of the songs are bad & the lesser ones only suffer by comparison to the Beach Boys at their very best. If Brian had had more time to spend on this album instead of rush releasing it to fit within the 50th anniversary tour I'm sure it would have been a masterpiece but what we have instead is a very good but slightly flawed album with flashes of extreme brillance that goes a long way towards washing the bad taste of Stars & Stripes Vol 1 & Summer In Paradise away. If it is to be the capstone of a phenominal career, it' will be a fitting finale. All in all this is an album I thought I would never see and am more than happy have. The Rolling Stone article says they recorded 28 songs. Here's to hoping they see a future release. This part is only for the vinyl version. The  sound is perfect & way better than the CD but the vinyl version has the flimsiest  covers in recent memory. It reminds me of the old K-Tel records or later the cover for a 12\\" single. Very thin & easily damaged. A inner sleve stiffiner with the credits woulld have been nice. Still the more I listen to the album the more I like it.rsion has the flimsiest  covers in recent memory.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is the best show ever made - Ever! Season two just ended Sunday night on HBO and it is a bit depressing that I have to wait another year before Season 3. For solace I am reading book three of A song of Fire and Ice, A storm of Swords which I understand will be split into two seasons on HBO (3 & 4). What is so amazing about this show is the world it is created in - especially the continent of Westeros where we are completely immersed. The imagery of the Eyrie with its three towers built into Giants Lance in the Mountains of the Moon and the sky cell dungeons where Tyrion was impriosned is like a nightmare dreamworld. Some of the more controversial themes have been done before but the way we are confronted with them is so shocking like the attempted murder of Bran, the incest and its consequence that propogates all of the events of Game of Thrones, the six year old Lord who is still breastfed (older in the show), the sly manipulations of seemingly minor characters that bring the whole world to war - it's intricate multi-layered and absolutley engrossing. George RR Martins treatment of his characters in this world is masterpiece. None of the players of which there are hundreds is one- dimensional. None of them purely good or purely evil. You find yourself rooting for the bad guys in spite of yourself because there is a deep and flawed humanity to every character ... even the Hound! While you find Sansa annoying and irratating in one scence you want to give her a hug in another. While you loathe the abominable King Joffrey in almost every scene you cant help but blame his mother or his \\"bad genes\\" for his sociopathy, especially when you can see he is only a child flushed in humilation at the end of the \\"Butcher Boy\\" scene on the Kings Road. While you adore Arya, you know she is much more complex and will be revealed throughout the story as her \\"Dark Sister\\" emerges. And then there's Tyrion.... Bravo to George Martin and HBO for creating the most interesting character ever portrayed in my opionion. Instead of a cliched carciture of a silly and dismissable dwarf, \\"The IMP\\", we have Tyrion of the evil Lannister clan, a Lannister we cant help but love and root for. If there is a \\"hero\\" to the story, it must be Tyrion, right? Peter Dinklage won the Emmy last year and Im sure there are more in his future especially after watching season 2 where Tyrion comes into his own and then falls hard.<br /><br />Bottom line, the best show you will ever see. I am sure this show will go on and on through all the books and the ones to come - We have 9 or 10 years of Game of Thrones to get lost in and I am in all the way. Game of Thrones is the only reason I pay for premium cable. Yes, Homeland is a great show on Showtime but I could wait for the DVD. I am also a huge fan of Damages but I wont switch to Direct TV for it now and will also wait. But Game of Thrones, no way... it's must watch televsion!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much.  this is the best game to play out of all of them. This game is for free.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game but would be worlds better if the friends viewing and adding worked.<br />would also like to see more mini games like kungfoo scratch.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I could tell you what is so awesome about this movie but there is just to much and I don';t want to type forever.<br />I personally expected it to be a good movie (Because the other Marvel movies are pretty good), But I didn't expect it to be this good... Period!<br />Loaded with action & comedy in moments. Anyone who gives this below 4 stars is just a hater plain and simple. Can't wait for the next one and the new Iron Man movie coming next summer.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I've always \\"liked\\" John Mayer but after this album, I LOVE him!  What a really nice surprise.  I bought this album on a whim after I saw his interview with Ellen DeGeneres and figured I'd give it a try.  Needless to say, it's already been beaten to death.<br /><br />My favorite song on the recording is \\"Whisky, Whisky, Whisky\\" which is reminiscent of Neil Young with strong instrumentals and great guitar and harmonica.  I always judge a song with harmonica as being \\"good harmonica\\" when my dog sings along.  Only Bob Dylan and Neil Young can get him going, well now John Mayer can too.  Seriously, the album is terrific, and the inclusion of heavy hitter Chuck Leavell's talents don't go unnoticed.<br /><br />\\"Something about Olivia\\", a folksy story of lusting after another guy's woman, is also well done.  Same for \\"If I Ever Get Around to Living\\", which is deep and soulful, also a great description of the whole album.  It's obvious Mayer is doing some soul searching here.....doesn't that always make for the best music?<br /><br />You'll love it!
B0086700CM|4.0|Its a great game. Good fun when you have nothing else to do. Only problem is when you get a higher score it lags on the kindle fire the longer you go.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it but even though it looks easy its not. some of the games are very challenging.  its fun though
B0000024JN|5.0|yes very good cd and now that the lead singer is dead even better cd as it is now a clasic and every one will want it as they have always made good rock rap together
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Great movie in a series of movies, enjoying them all iron man, thor, hulk, all leading to the avengers. Nothing like em!  Awesome
006197806X|4.0|I'm sure by now you've probably read quite a few reviews for Pandemonium that go something like this \\"I couldn't possibly put my feelings for this book into words\\" or \\"What in the world just happened?!\\" And that pretty much sums it up. I'm not going to write my usual review for this one since I feel like basically anything I say would be a spoiler, but I will say that Lauren Oliver has written a solid sequel.<br /><br />Everything about Pandemonium is a journey. There's literal journeys and emotional journeys and every last one of them are spectacular.  Almost everything feels entirely real, like it actually could've happened on its own without too much luck.<br /><br />It did feel a little stagnant at some parts, but I know that it can't always be about action and life-risking.<br /><br />The Nutshell: Pandemonium is a fantastic sequel that is likely to satisfy (at least for the duration of the book) lovers of Delirium.
B0083EXW50|4.0|Im on my third time listening to this cd and its really great if you were a fan of the mechanize album youll like this one as well however, I would say compared to Mechanize its not as good but still pretty great.  Any big fan of industrial metal, metal or this band should check out this album by one of the most influential bands of the 90s.<br /><br />Update 11-4-14: I've been listening to this cd on and off since it came out and i like it more every time i hear it.  This band strengths imo despite the brute force of the music is in the subleties within each song creating atmosphere like no other band i ever heard.  I know im in the minority here but this band imo belongs on a list along side the Beatles and the Rolling stones and all the greats who came out after even if it is way lower on the list somewhere.  Here's to hoping Fear Factory blazes a few more trails!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love temple run i could play it for hours and hours. im so lucky they came out with this game or i would be sad and bored
1466401885|3.0|The first half of the book was fun but things got drawn out and became surreal. Felt like too much happened toward the end of the book. And it was easy to get irritated at the main characters from then on. All in all, there was plot and character development. And it demonstrates that people with issues can still find love. Give it a read but it won't be a story worth talking about to your friends.
B0086700CM|4.0|I downloaded it offline to my kindle MONTHS ago. Ive had the app on my kindle for a long time now. Amazon is soooo slow...
0345803485|1.0|i am an avid reader and cannot express how disappointed i was with this series.  now, i have to take into account i go for psychological thrillers but i thought the BDSM ticklers would lead to some of that in a story line.  i read all three books within four days because i refused to admit there would never be a story line.  at the end of book one i figured the author was just stretching her material into three books (with an abundance of sex scenes as filler) to get people to buy three books instead of one.  when i finished the third book i realized there was nothing to the series besides the sex. had she removed the sex there would be about a short story left at best. what little story line she made an effort at didn't even tie in at the end of the series.<br /><br />i think my favorite part was when she wrote about one of the characters waking in a hospital and needing to go the bathroom.  she goes on to write that the person couldn't leave the bed until the nurse removed her catheter.  COME ON E.L. a catheter is what makes you not need to physically walk to the bathroom!  there are so many more of these types of references that i started thinking the book was written by a pre-twenty-something.  someone not very experienced in life. and thought maybe that's why it was so poorly written.  to find it is an actual adult is harsh.<br /><br />and, how did this man make his money?!?!  never any reference to it.  exactly what was resolved in his private meeting with his parents?  what did they offer him about his childhood?  where did taylor come from?  what happened with his sister and her boyfriend?  there is absolutely NO character development!  i can't write too many comments because i don't want to be a spoiler - but there are so many instances of opportunity to actually produce a story here and she never puts them together.  business deals left hanging.  never mention of why they started or where they went.  relationships/ties that are never fully explained (at least not beyond that of a three-year old intellect).  there is no substance to any of these books.<br /><br />most of all....what was his obsession with eating?  why?  was he starved as a child???  yes, he had a terrible few days but does this make an obsession for life?  never an explanation!<br /><br />she could have had a hell of a story here if she picked up the little pieces she had put together and ran with them instead of focusing on what little knowledge she has of the BDSM world.  it appears they only research done for this book was that of either personal experiences or an obsessions with BDSM.  don't get me wrong... this is an interesting world for many.  but, these books appear to be nothing more than a way for naive and/or bored women to \\"get off\\" (excuse me - but that's the only appropriate term i can come up with).<br /><br />i feel ripped off.  i wasn't looking for a porn book - i can buy those online anywhere.  i was looking for an interesting novel with twists and turns.  there are no twists - no turns - no suspense - nothing to wait for - nothing ever happens besides a few opportunities to turn it into an interesting story and she drops the ball instead.  the BEST part of the seris in around Chapter 22 in book #3.  she should have put this in book #1 and developed on it.  this series is a lackluster effort at best.  Save your $ and read something else.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the display. I've used this app for a week or so and it seems to work fine. The display is easy to read.
B004QL7K70|5.0|this was such a fun movie to watch with friends. the soundtrack is awesome and after the credits roll you feel all hyped up and just want to party!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Most fun I have had in a long time!  Best thing is each try is something new-you are not running the same path over and over.  Very addicting!!  Graphics are fantastic and there is not a lot of lag time and reload is instant.

B005UBNKZG|5.0|I've been waiting nearly five years to upgrade my computer.  In that time, I've been getting by on an old Athlon X2 @2.6Ghz.  Games of the past few years had started feeling sluggish and it was all CPU-bound; my GPU wasn't really capable of shining as my CPU/RAM wasn't keeping up.  Most aggravating though is that I transcode a great deal of video and audio, and to transcode standard-def video into x264 at a measly 10fps was just painful.<br /><br />My motherboard decided to go belly-up a week ago, and I knew it was time to build a new rig.  I decided right away that I wanted something that could chew up encoding jobs and an 8-core CPU fit the bill.  I also knew I needed enough speed to handle even the newest games.  After seeing the price premium charged by Intel, and reading that the FX line's initial launch problems (mostly regarding specific Steam games) had been resolved, I lept.  I have *not* been disappointed.<br /><br />The FX-8120 can be easily overclocked to 4.2Ghz, or higher with after-market cooling (I've seen 4.9Ghz with water cooling), though I choose to set it at the stock 3.1Ghz and let my mobo ramp up the clock cycles as necessary up to 4.2Ghz.  The CPU goes anywhere from 1.7-4.2Ghz, as the work load dictates.  This processor eats parallelized work loads for breakfast!  Handbrake sings opera on this CPU and really shows off what 8 cores can do.  Using the exact same encoding settings, I as able to encode the same standard-def material at a whopping 81fps, not the previous 10.  To put that in perspective, a 2-hour movie used to take 288 minutes to transcode (about five hours).  Now, that same 2-hour movie takes 35.5 minutes.  Wow.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Games *never* dip below my vsync rate (60fps), even the newest blockbusters I've tried, at extreme settings and running 1080p.  If I turn off vsync, games run anywhere from 110fps average (Diablo III) to 220fps average (Half-Life 2/Counter-Strike Source).  Since I hate screen tearing and alwaysleave vync on this bodes very well for a long relationship with this CPU.  I did have a few problems launching Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2; after updating my motherboard's firmware and re-installing the games, they now run just beautifully.  Bottom line: this CPU screams no matter what job I've thrown at it.<br /><br />And that's where things go down-hill: this CPU SCREAMS.  It sounds like a freakin' shop-vac when the workload is heavy!!!  Please don't disregard this; when cranked up full-tilt the cooler fan runs at well over 6000rpm, and I can hear it from the other end of my house.  My case even has foam sound insulation and it sounds like the CPU could take off for a vacation in Fiji any minute, and it's gonna take the full-tower system with it if it has to.  So distracting is the noise that I ended up purchasing an after-market water cooling system to replace the stock cooler.  I don't consider this a huge negative in the grand scheme of things as I almost always purchase after-market cooling solutions for my CPUs and had already planned to overclock this CPU eventually, but as a potential buyer you should be aware that the stock cooler is incredibly loud.
B0086700CM|5.0|BEST app ever!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this app never did I think I would love this app as much as I do now.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I just wanted to offset the one-star reviews. Great record by a great bunch of dudes. Not much else to say.
0307730697|5.0|Eric Blehm's newest book, \\"Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown\\" is essentially the story of Adam Brown's life. The title made me believe that perhaps the story would begin as Adam entered the military, or even after his advancement to SEAT Team SIX, but this story begins exactly where it should - at the very beginning of Adam's life. This man lead such an amazing life that it would have been a disservice to him to start anywhere else for this book. From his early days through his last mission as a SEAL, Adam showed through his actions the man that he was. Deeply devoted, loving, kind, and charitable are just a few of the words that describe this American hero. Adam Brown was real, with baggage, like a past addiction, and through his love for his family, love for God, he overcame, and became exactly what he was destined to be. This book is a tribute to Adam's life, and I think it was written perfectly.
0061122416|3.0|This book promised to change life forever. Not a bad idea or writing, I just found myself at odds with the execution of Santiago's travels and life. I expected to be inspired spiritually, but not bored with it. Sort of like The Celestine Prophecy.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|An amazing movie with excellent acting and f-x.<br /><br />As a long fan of the steam-punk approach to sci-fi, I find this movie the best demonstration of the concept yet put forth from Hollywood..<br /><br />Unfortunately, Disney did a very poor job marketing this flick. If they had done a better job... this one would have made millions!
0345803485|4.0|I had heard a lot of negative things about the Fifty Shades trilogy and wanted to know what all the fuss was about.  I must admit that I was hooked from the 3rd or 4th page.  The beginning wasn't the greatest opening to a book I've read, but it certainly kept me wanting to read more.  As far as BDSM goes...this is pretty mild.  But for those who aren't used to slight erotica, this might be strange at first.  It's a lot like reading soft porn, but it doesn't really get too gruesome.  Overall, the first book was a fun read.  I ordered the next two in the series because the relationship issues intrigue me, and I want to know more about the main male character.
B002VISNBC|5.0|very funny and o so exiting the pranks they do on each other were hillerious!! definently worth reading more the once
B0086700CM|5.0|it is true this game is quite addicting. I cant put it down! once you start playing you just keep going. its really lots of fun
B0086700CM|5.0|The BEST game available for Android.  Perfect for the Kindle Fire.  I have been waiting a long time for this to be available for the Fire &amp; I am not disappointed at all.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|did not expect to love this book. finished in one day, wonderful. could not put it down, i will definitely recommend it to many people.
B007O4XX6S|4.0|This review is for the vinyl record, not the CD...<br /><br />First off, let me commend Joe and his label for including a download card for 24khz/96bit .wav files!  This should be standard fare with all new vinyl releases - but if you're lucky enough to get a download card most are crappy-sounding .mp3 files (like Santana's new Shape Shifter download, which sounds nothing like the vinyl release...) But I digress.<br /><br />Let's face it.  Joe is lucky to be alive.  Many of his contemporaries are not, due to drugs, booze, living the rock n' roll lifestyle, disease and plain old age.  Thank God he's still here to make music like he did on this album!<br /><br />OK, so it's not \\"But Seriously Folks\\" or even close to some of his other gems.  But it's a good album, and the more I listen the more I like it.  Because today (Tuesday June 5th) was the first day the hi-res download was available, I just got the files and I'm listening to them as I write this.  I can't say enough about how good it is to hear ol' Joe rockin' my system!<br /><br />As soon as the music starts, you know you're listening to Joe Walsh.  Most of the songs are heartfelt, and clearly crating this album was good for his soul.  I suspect we'll hear a lot more from him in the future - perhaps a new James Gang album?<br /><br />As for sonics, both the vinyl pressing and the hi-res download sound good, but they were obviously put together in ProTools.  I have not yet heard the CD, but suspect that it will suffer from some compression given how dynamic the vinyl and hi-res file are.<br /><br />If you're a Joe Walsh/James Gang/Eagles fan, this is an album worth adding to your collection.  Like Joe, I'm also an Analog Man - and I give it two thumbs up!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fave game. had a hard time a month back w glitches. they have been updated and now it runs smoothly :D love it!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|It came highly recommended and I was not disappointed :)  I was entertained and I will read it again in the near future !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a book so fast...I seriously looked forward to my book. I was hesitant to buy the 2nd one because I get nothing done !!! Everyone I talk to feels the same as I do...fabulous and SEXy read.
B007XT4AMA|4.0|I'm a little sorry that Rumer chose to make cover versions of 70s songs for this second album because she can write great stuff of her own and I don't think that some of the material here is up to her standard. That said, she performs it all wonderfully and the album as a whole is an engaging listen with some absolutely terrific highlights. It's very well produced and the overall sound is great - often making Rumer sound *exactly* like Karen Carpenter, which is just fine by me. Her silky tone, hint of vibrato and perfect phrasing do all these songs proud.<br /><br />You may well not share any of my reservations. Part of the problem for me is probably that I was there in the 70s when all these songs were first released and some of them carry a lot of baggage for me. I have always hated the schmaltz of Gilbert O'Sullivan's `We Will' and `A Man Needs A Maid' was my least favourite song on Harvest, for example. However, `PF Sloan' and `Home Thoughts From Abroad' are absolutely magnificent here and the rest of the material is varied, generally good and superbly performed.<br /><br />So...I think it's a matter of whether you like the songs. If you do, you'll love the album - it's the loving product of a very fine musician performing superbly.
B0086700CM|5.0|FINALLY! Amazon made us wait long enough while trying to get us to waste our money on junk that mimicked temple run like temple rum. Lame. This is an absolutely awesome app with almost no issues. And get this, this awesome app is FREE! Hopefully minecraft pocket edition &amp; jetpack joyride will come soon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. challenging fun to play for hours.  wish you could get more points faster to be able to open more games.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This fine album starts with a gorgeous harmony piece reminiscent of \\"Our Prayer\\" from Smile. The next several songs have the Mike Love stamp of simplistic, yet feel good lyrics sung over the sophisticated Brian Wilson arrangements. The drums on \\"Isn't It Time\\" are noteworthy, in their simple yet complex tom tom pounding,.. The melodies are great - you have to smile.You can't help singing along - Even the first time you hear it. Bots of recognition will hit you when you here the drum riff straight from \\"Be My Baby\\" (It is, after all, Brian's favorite song) Then the masterpiece comes. While Pet Sounds was about the pains of transitioning to adulthood, culminated by the plaintive loss of innocence in \\"Caroline No\\" , this album ...this song suite of \\"From There and Back Again\\",  \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\", and \\"Summer's Gone\\" is a plaintive look back, recognizing that the end is approaching..that Summer Is Indeed Gone. \\"Summer's Gone\\" is the plaintive finale, filled with weariness. Notice how the waves and wind chimes stay on, even as Brian stops...life goes on. I didn't expect songs as poignant and gorgeous as these. The entire album is worthwhile - the final three will stay with me in that Pet Sounds part of my heart
0345803485|1.0|This book is silly and not in the good way.  It's Beauty and the Beast with tie me up, blindfold me, spank me ~ not particularly creative and much better done by others.  As for those who found this shocking ~ get out more.<br />(If you are interested in good explicit sex then read Emma Holly, Lacey Alexander, Robin Schone, or Laurell K. Hamilton ~ THAT'S erotica!)
B001UAX56A|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all times. Perfect blend of R&B and Hip Hop. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is one of a kind and still hope one day Ms. Hill will come out with a comparable sequel. My favorite tracks include the title track, \\"Ex-factor\\" which anybody who has been in a turbulent relationship can relate too, and to Zion.

0316017930|3.0|This fascinating work of non-fiction discusses interesting theories about what makes a person successful in what they do. It is suggested that much of success is a product of simple (and not so simple) luck. Circumstances and coincidences play a huge role in what makes someone succeed, especially in cases of extraordinary levels of achievement. Another major factor analyzed is practice. It has been found that anyone committing to 10,000 hours (which takes about 10 years out of a lifetime) of practice or dedicated work/study is most likely to excel in that field. While these facts and notions are daunting, it is also promising to think that with enough dedication and time a person might be able to accomplish almost anything.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"

B007N31ZLA|5.0|...I remember when this film was in movie theaters and what a wonderful and fun time we all had watching it. The music was so unique and Marvin Hamlisch became himself quite a big star because of it...not to mention the music revival of Scott Joplin and ragtime. The two stars worked the same charm previously exuded in Butch Cassidy and Sundance...and what an ending!Everyone gasped and stood up and cheered!..Glad to know a superb print in blu ray is coming out. A keeper for sure.[[ASIN:B007055JQ8 Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series]]

B004XE0P5E|1.0|IF I were going to commit suicide this is the CD that I would pop in the player as I popped the xanax and hoisted the rope over the ceiling beams.  Horribly depressing and unbelievably boring.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I read the Princess of Mars several decades ago and remember it fondly.<br /><br />While this story is an adaptation of an adaptation, it turned out to be decent, much to my surprise. There is a bit of wooden dialog, but the \\"flavor\\" of Barsoom is well captured in this production. Being Disney, the mild lack of clothing for the Princess is understandable (she is naked in the novel).<br /><br />The action is typical of many of today's action stories, and that doesn't help when it comes to making this thing stand out. Bookended by John Carter's \\"literary\\" association with the author (Edgar Rice Burroughs), it doesn't end with the cliff hanger of the book (many of Burroughs series, including Tarzan, followed the same pattern -- boy discovers girl, boy loses girl, boy has to overcome almost impossible odds to save girl, only to end the story with boy and girl being again separated, despite their obvious love for each other). That same formula is repeated in the movie and it works well.<br /><br />While the \\"real\\" Dejah Thoris is young (around twenty), the actress in the film (Lynn Collins) did an admirable job playing her opposite Taylor Kitsch's John Carter, despite being older (thirty-something). Kitsch, himself, isn't too bad, but the performance is uneven. As a former rebel, wanting nothing to do with the Union Army in the American Southwest, he was tough and no-nonsense. Once transported to Mars, he became somewhat less rebellious, giving me the impression that I was watching two different characters. I wasn't sure if that was intended, but Carter of Mars (and the end of the film back on earth) reminded me more of Hugh Jackman in Kate and Leopold, rather than his tough as, well, nails Wolverine.<br /><br />Still, effects were good, CGI pretty much seamless, and okay Burroughs-esque story. A very strong three stars, rounded up to four.

B007FRA8Z8|5.0|There are several reviews that already go on at length as to why this album is so awesome---it's quirky, funny, melodic yet edgy, melancholic yet musically upbeat, Marina has a great voice etc etc etc....All these things are true though. For me though, this album is the perfect example of taking mainstreamish beats (enough so that they are instantly catchy) and layering them with rich, textured lyrics and singing. This album is just fun. It's edgy bubblegum pop at its shiniest and brightest.

B00884GR0W|5.0|Block story is a labor of love from talented developers and it needs to be seen as such. It is not trying to be a port of minecraft but rather a rpg and adventure game using some elements that minecraft pioneered. Technically block story is more impressive than minecraft pocket edition, it features infinite worlds and specular lighting and around 90 dynamic mobs. Additionally it will be updated much more frequently. It is unfair to the developers to give a baseless rating purely on the fact that the app is not what you expect. It needs to be rated upon its own merits and those are worthy of five stars. My thanks to the russian devs, your hard work really shows and it makes me excited to see the future of block story
B0083GPDBO|4.0|I was never sure if rent this movie or not, afraid to see the nth 'teen movie' but then I did, and it was a surprise a good surprise.<br />That movie has the (very) rare quality to seem 'real'/'true' despite its 'strong fantasy side' (great goal!). The young actors performs very well and special effect for a low budget movie are almost perfect [My only doubt is (I try to not to anticipate nothing) when these teens are up to see something important, this is the only scenery/visually weak part].<br />It underlines in a fantasy-way several problems like: teen agers bullys, the difficulties in relationships, loneliness, illness, the high schools that looks inadequate to fit the teens problems, the big contrast between many male teen agers and the father.<br />A nowadays not-so-much-as-it-seems-fairy-tale where be-a-teen-ager-it's-not-so-easy-as-adults-love-to-think-it-is.<br />:(

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Brilliant. Great read from beginning to finish. Must be one of the best books I have read for a very long time.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I can't give it less then five stars. There are some flaws on the album, but I am overwhelmed by the quality of the overall effort. I was expecting nostalgia crap and re-recordings of golden oldies. The album however is mostly refreshing. If you skip The Private Life Of Bill And Sue and Daybreak Over The Ocean it is really just an excellent album. Think About The Days is a beautiful and laid back intro. After that we are treated to the very pretty and jubilant That's Why God Made The Radio. The title may be a trite, but that doesn't spoil the fun. It sounds like the Beach Boys. And that is something that is the most remarkable thing about the album. It is a BEACH BOYS album in 2012. The best stuff starts with track 10, From There To Back Again. Al Jardine's vocal is great. The song itself is heartbreakingly beautiful and absolutely nothing like anything being written by anyone these days. It is Brian Wilson magic. It moves effortlessly into the beautiful Pacific Coast Highway and the album is finished with the poignant Summer's Gone. There is way more on the album to enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a real good game and I got far and bought a lot of things and also have a lot of coins.

B007WFR1MQ|5.0|Found out about the new album a few days ago, listened to the samples here and decided to get the release date limited edition. So far I have no regrets.<br /><br />My first FF album was Demanufacture around the time it came out and I've been a fan since. This album goes back to the earlier days in terms of songs and the whole concept thing and is in my view the ideal marriage between the song style of Demanufacture and the concept album thing of Obsolete. Call me an old fart, but I like the well done mix of shouting and singing.<br /><br />Cool synth/sound stuff from FLA's Rhys Fulber, great drum programming (I think Hoglan could do this as tight), great guitar and vocal sound. I like the album better than Mechanize. Not sure why, I guess more \\"songs\\". Mechanize might suffer from being \\"the album after Transgression\\". After Transgression I kind of gave up on them, songs might've been OK, but it's just a pain to listen to.<br /><br />Anyway, this is in my opinion the best FF album in many years, and maybe even the best. I enjoy the variety, fits some of the \\"industrial wasteland\\" imaging they try to bring across.

0345803485|1.0|So many people encouraged me to get this book so I finally did.  It's fun to read the same books or watch the same shows as friends...as we all know.  I downloaded the trilogy onto my iPad.  What a waste of $30.  And, yes, I did read enough to give it a chance.  I won't waste my time with details but it is so unrealistic that I wouldn't waste my time reading it, either.  I said 'oh, give me a break' and 'seriously?' so many times.  I finally deleted it and haven't regretted doing so.  The biggest turn off is how immaturely it's written.  Such a great chance for an interesting trilogy that missed the mark big time.

B002NJUN44|3.0|ERAGON takes place in world that resembles a middle-aged Earth, but on film looks more like a cheap imitation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS Middle Earth. Eragon (Edward Speleers) is a young farm boy who lives with his uncle and cousin. They live in the country, but the kingdom in which they live is ruled by an evil dictator named Galbatorix (John Malkovich). Galbatorix is the last of the dragon riders. The dragon riders used to be guardians of justice and agents of peace, but Galbatorix took advantage of fractions within the riders to kill them or their dragons off until he was the last of the dragon riders. He then took control of the lands he was supposed to protect and killed any who stood in his way. Much of the resistance was destroyed, but a fragment remained, hidden somewhere in mountains at the edge of the kingdom. In addition to being the last dragon rider, Galbatorix also has an ally in a Shade named Durza. Shades are basically magicians with demonic powers.<br /><br />Anyway, one evening while Eragon is hunting he discovers a large, beautiful blue stone. Thinking he might be able to trade the stone for food he takes it. It isn't until later that he discovers the stone isn't a stone at all, but is a dragon egg that hatches before his eyes. The dragon is named Saphira and has selected Eragon as her rider. Saphira was stolen from King Galbatorix and he's really mad about it. Once it hatches, he wants Saphira's rider killed because if you kill the rider you kill the dragon. Eragon doesn't realize the peril he is in until a town vagrant named Brom comes to his aid and assist him on a journey to the rebellion stronghold in the mountains. The return of the dragon riders was prophesized years ago and Eragon suddenly finds himself as a new hope for the fledging resistance.<br /><br />The plot of the movie sounds interesting enough, but the execution of that plot has been done poorly. Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, and Djimon Hounsou are all excellent actors but only Irons has any real screen time while the others are basically reduced to playing cameos. Also, although Irons has a lot of screen time, his character doesn't have anything new or interesting to say. The actors do their best, but with the writing given to them they come off being as water-downed version of characters from THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, HARRY POTTER, or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.<br /><br />Therein lays two of the major problems of the movie. The writing is pretty lame and the most significant moments of the film seem to be cheap imitations of some of the most memorable fantasy and sci-fi films made. Remember in LORD OF THE RINGS when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are escaping the Ring Wraiths by leaving the Shire and crossing the river Brandywine? That scene is in this movie. Remember in the original STAR WARS when Obi-Wan Kenobi lets himself be struck down so he can become a part of the force and better help Luke? That scene is in this movie, too.<br /><br />Another problem with the film is the pacing. The entire movie runs about ninety minutes. I couldn't believe the film was over when it ended. Many things had been rushed through or totally skipped from the novel. The movie could have easily been expanded to two or two and a half hours and would probably have been a better picture. A fantasy film of this magnitude needs time to simmer and fermentate. It shouldn't be rushed. I mean, the average children's animated movie runs around ninety minutes now, an epic fantasy adventure should at least be two hours long.<br /><br />The one thing that I was rather impressed by in the film was the dragon. Saphira looked very real on screen and is a beautiful creature to behold, fantastical or not.<br /><br />Overall, ERAGON is an average fantasy film that moves at a very rushed pace and never reaches the promise of the great movie it could have been. I don't blame the director, but I do blame the studio because I know they pressured the filmmakers to finish the movie as fast as they could. An epic fantasy film shouldn't be filmed in just a month. Fans of the book might enjoy the movie, but they will probably be disappointed. Instead, this movie version is more for very young children and those looking for a short, non-original fantasy movie.rs to finish the movie as fast as they could.

0345803485|4.0|This book and the other two that follow were awesome. I haven't read anything like it. I was hooked and couldn't stop reading. I'm sad that I'm all done with them. I might have to read them all over again. I must read for those that love romance novels... plus something more.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|People who tend to think that come-backs and reunions are only made for commercial reasons must be people who don't know about the deep bonding that happpens when people play music together. Ok, it is not always the magic can be re-created, but in most cases something surprisingly worthwhile comes out of the effort.<br /><br />That is definitely the case with this 50 years reunion album from one of the greatest bands ever. Uniting the three surviving original members Brian Wilson, Al Jardine and Mike Love with 2 musicians who has an imporatant place in the history of the band. Mainstay Bruce Johnstone and the more obscure surf guitarist David Marks who joined the band at only 13 and played on the first 4 albums.<br /><br />Not surprisingly Brian Wilson is the driving force here, many of the tracks based on demos of songs he had made over the years - with Beach Boys in mind. Helped out by old time friend - and sometimes 'enemy, at least in the court rooms - Mike Love, multi-talent Jeff Foskett and co-producer Joe Thomas. And a host of first-rate studio-musicians, mostly from Brian's touring band but also guitar-legend Jeff 'Skunk' Baxter.<br /><br />There are some beautiful gems here. The title track is certainly a bona fide hit song. Some more introspective songs like \\"From there to back again\\". Not a bad song, interesting arrangements, exemplary playing and on top it: the still present and vital vocal magic. And as always with music of this calliber an album that wins tremedously from repeated listenings

B00005JN0T|4.0|I, ROBOT is based upon ideas created by Isaac Asimov, the beloved and prolific writer who invented many of the \\"rules\\" for writing modern science-fiction. Asimov's book I, ROBOT is the novel that cemented the three laws of robotics: 1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; 3. A robot must protect its own existence, except where such protection would conflict with the First or Second Law. The movie takes those concepts and one of the main character's from Asimov's novel (Susan Calvin, played by Bridget Moynahan) and introduces a story that feels like one of the short stories included in Asimov's I, ROBOT.<br /><br />In the movie, Will Smith plays Chicago detective Del Spooner. Ever since a freak accident, that the audience is briefly given glimpses of in the opening of the movie, Spooner has had strong misgivings about robots. Even though they are supposed to be incapable of hurting a human, Spooner is convinced that robots are up to no good and he doesn't trust them. His feelings towards the machines are beginning to affect his career. Then, Dr. Lanning, one of the executives of US Robots and a friend of Spooner, is found dead at US Robots headquarters apparently because of a suicide. Spooner doesn't believe that and is convinced it's murder. He begins an investigation which leads to the arrest of a robot for murder. But can a robot kill or is Dr. Lanning's death just a small part of a much more sinister plan?<br /><br />I, ROBOT is an entertaining film. It's fairly well written and contains some great acting which is augmented by the movie's special effects. Also, watch out for a small role by Shia LaBeouf as Farber, a street smart kid that looks up to Spooner. The film doesn't raise as many questions as the novel it is very loosely based upon. However, the movie still raises a few questions about the nature of humanity and the mechanized society in which we are increasingly becoming consumed. Overall, I, ROBOT is a surprisingly good movie.about the nature of humanity and the mechanized society in which we are increasingly becoming consumed. Overall, I, ROBOT is a surprisingly good movie.
1118109791|3.0|This is THE book for studying GMAT, so why only 3 stars?<br /><br />While the 9 first chapters are what I expected, the exercises of the new chapter (integrated reasoning) are NOT in the book: the book gives you a 6 month access to them on the \\"companion website\\".  This is thus the first math book I ever buy with a limited access to it's exercises.<br /><br />While some argue that there are new exercises I wonder why they did replace old ones instead of giving us more to practice?  The old exercises where not worse or better, just different.<br /><br />This new chapter is thus the main reason justifying the acquisition of this new edition.<br /><br />The marketing fluff around it, combined with the lack of content in this chapter have caused me a big disappointment: this feels as a commercial ripoff, thus justifying the 3 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />In case you are planning to skip the integrated reasoning part of the exam, the book is awesome.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a hard movie to describe. It's sort of a teen comedy, but it's not the average teen comedy (especially one produced in part by MTV). There aren't many side-splitting one-liners or over-the-top-gross out gags. The foulest word in the film is either \\"freaking\\" or \\"crap\\". The only physical violence in the movie is done by high school bullies or a local martial arts master. There isn't any sex (heck there's hardly any sexual innuendo). The movie doesn't even really have a point.<br /><br />Yet, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE works and works exceedingly well. It's a hilarious movie filled with some extremely memorable characters. The characters are quirky and filled with foibles. Yet, bizarre as they appear, they are so realistic it's uncanny. Who doesn't know somebody like Uncle Rico? Had my maternal grandmother lived long enough, I bet she would have spent her weekends riding an ATV. Anybody else know somebody who thinks selling \\"tupperware\\" is a \\"real job\\"? The characters in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE are people sliced out of the real-life heart of America.<br /><br />The story of the movie resolves around high schooler, Napoleon Dynamite. He has a 32 year-old brother, Kip, who sits around at home talking to girls on the internet 4-6 hours a day. The brothers live with their Grandma, who sneaks out to do extreme sports with her friends. Grandma gets hurt 4-wheeling on some sand dunes and Uncle Rico is sent to \\"help\\" the brothers while Granny recovers. Rico still lives in 1982, just before the big high school football game when the coach didn't put him in and they lost. There's a girl at school named Deb who runs her own photography studio who has a major crush on Napoleon, though he doesn't figure it out for the longest time. Napoleon's best friend is a recent immigrant student named Pedro. Pedro decides he wants to run for class president and the rest of the movie revolves around Pedro's campaign and what Napoleon does to help his friend.<br /><br />The actors in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE were pretty-much no names at the time the movie originally came out (Haylie Duff, sister to Hillary was, perhaps the biggest name at the time). Jon Heder, Tina Majorino (who played the girl with the map on her back in WATERWORLD), Aaron Ruell, Jon Gries, and Efren Ramirez are all excellent in their roles. In lesser skilled actors, their roles could have been spoofy, cheesy, or over-the-top. Instead, they grind their characters to reality.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of great scenes and lines and is destined to become one of the most quoted movies of all time (right up with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, TOMMY BOY, and STAR WARS). The movie also boasts a delightful soundtrack that includes everything from \\"Time After Time\\" to the \\"A-Team Theme\\" to \\"I Want Candy\\". As quirky as the film is, it contains some strong messages about the importance of family, sticking by your friends, following your dreams, and being the person God created you to be. All of that and chicken talons, too. In short, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is one of the most bizarre, but best films from 2004.LEON DYNAMITE were pretty-much no names at the time the movie originally came out (Haylie Duff, sister to Hillary was, perhaps the biggest name at the time).

All of that and chicken talons, too. In short, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is one of the most bizarre, but best films from 2004.
B0073PPKNM|2.0|Gardot is an amazing talent which she showed us all on her previous albums.  But this is just background music. I was so excited to hear she was coming out with this and I pre-ordered it on Amazon.  I love Gardot and I love Brazilian music, but this album just doesn't work.

B001AK3S4Y|5.0|HELLBOY begins in 1944 Scotland. Hitler has been organizing a paranormal team for sometime, led by the infamous Russian Zarist advisor, Rasputin. President Roosevelt has dispatched a team to stop the evil scum before they release dark powers from another realm. The Americans succeed in thwarting the Nazis' plan and Rasputin is sucked into the nether regions. However, before the victory, something from the great beyond comes through the portal. That something turns out to be a little red demon with a huge stone fist. The Americans are entranced by the creature and name him Hellboy. Hellboy is adopted and raised by Professor Trevor Bloom (John Hurt) and the two become prominent, but hidden members of the secret paranormal branch of the FBI. Years later Rasputin is resurrected and it's up to Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Professor Bloom, Agent John Myers, and their staff to rid the world of the Rasputin menance.<br /><br />Ron Perlman portrays Hellboy and he embodies the character just as good, if not better than Tobey Maguire did as Spider-man or Christopher Reeves did as Superman. I don't think there is any other actor alive who could have captured the nuances of Hellboy so well. Heck, I'll go so far as to say that if Hollywood ever really seriously considered acting nominations for action/sci-fi pictures (they should consider all films, but they don't), Perlman would have one in the bag. The other supporting actors do a good job, too. Personally, I especially enjoyed the performance of John Hurt: he's one of the most underrated character actors of our time.<br /><br />The action in HELLBOY is typical of a comic book flick and some might hold that against the movie. Still, it is a comic book flick and for that, it's pretty good stuff. There is some fairly witty and original dialogue in the script and the direction of Guillermo del Toro holds everything in place. There are a few words of foul language here and there, but nothing that is out of place.<br /><br />My only complaint about the film is that the villains are completely underdeveloped. Most of the good guys have some sort of character development during the screen time (though Abe Sapien doesn't get a whole lot). However, the bad guys; and especially Rasputin, don't get any development at all. This is a little disappointing because Rasputin is such an interesting character and the film could have been even better with a little more Rasputin character development. Other than that, HELLBOY is one rip-roaring good time.only complaint about the film is that the villains are completely underdeveloped.

B006S009IY|4.0|FINDING NEVERLAND is a short biopic about author J.M. Barrie and how he came to write the play PETER PAN, which has gone on to become one of the most famous works of theatre and children's literature ever. The movie opens as Barrie watches his latest play being performed, displaying his anxiety. The play is a flop. From there the movie goes on to show Barrie's first meeting of the Llewelyn-Davies family, how he became friends with the family, the estrangement and eventual divorce from his wife, and how the Llewelyn Davies children inspired the creation of PETER PAN.<br /><br />Johnny Depp portrays Barrie. As is usually the case, Depp is in excellent form and is well deserving of the Oscar nomination he received. Kate Winslet plays the widowed and dying Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. Winslet has had a career of hits and misses. Her performance in FINDING NEVERLAND is one of her better performances, displaying a full range of her skills, rather than just typecasting her as a beautiful young romantic or as a naked crazy woman (or as the case in TITANIC the beautiful young naked woman). Dustin Hoffman has a supporting role in the film as does Ian Hart. However, it is the performance of Freddie Highmore as Peter Llewelyn Davies that is most outstanding. Highmore's performance is remarkable and is just as extraordinary as Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSE. It's a shame that Highmore didn't gain an Oscar nomination (though he did become friends with Depp-who he shares a birthday with-and Depp had him cast as Charlie Bucket in the upcoming Tim Burton version of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY).<br /><br />FINDING NEVERLAND is a touching film that doesn't degrade itself to schmaltz. The film plays with certain details of Barrie's life to make the movie more dramatic (for example, Arthur Llewelyn Davies was still alive when Barrie first met his family; there were five sons instead of four). Still, it does a great job at showing how Barrie's experiences with the Llewelyn Davies inspired the creation of Peter Pan. Most of the time the film also shies away from the mushy sentimentality that so many other films of similar type succumb to. FINDING NEVERLAND shows the good along with some of the bad and that even though a person may \\"need to go on pretending. Until the end.\\", sometimes we can only dream on a budget.inspired the creation of Peter Pan.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|The Beach Boys (at least the Beach Boys with Brian Wilson) have had as many comebacks as any band in rock and roll. This may very well be the last one (I hope not) but if so it's a wonderful parting gift. This is the kind of album you can listen to over and over; the melodies are great, the vocals are superb, the harmonies are intricate yet seem simple, and though it's designed to sell (it's the Beach Boys' after all) the guys sing it from their hearts. It's inspired and inspirational,
1846681332|3.0|The book is a quick read and is entertaining. It is a light-hearted look at why reading and libraries are so important.

B0073PPKNM|3.0|I love Melody Gardot and find her immensely talented.  I loved the older albums and found that she is really terrific to see live in concert. She has it all - the beautiful voice, unique style, and is very musically talented.  I have been waiting for this album and must admit, I am so disappointed. I like the song Amalia, but what is this format where you have a long stretch of nothing before the last song?  Hopefully it will grow on me over time, but it hasnt been that \\"immediate like\\" I had with the other two albums. I give it 3 stars and would not recommend this CD as a must have.

The auto-sensor function works perfectly and we have not had any problems with the light so far.  We highly recommend this light for whoever needs to brighten a dark spot quick and easily.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|I was immediately favorably inclined to like this new Joe Walsh album when I heard the opening guitar riff of the first cut, the title track.  As the songs continued to spin out, I was digging the classic Joe Walsh sound.  At the same time, I will acknowledge that some of the tunes are a bit on the mediocre side (ex., \\"Hi-Roller Baby\\").  But what pushed me up to the 4-star rating was the added presence of Jeff Lynne, who produced the album and plays on most songs.  His touch is mistakable on songs such as \\"Spanish Dancer\\" and \\"One Day at a Time.\\"  The latter tune particularly has elements of the Wilburys and ELO sound to it.  I also love the nod back to the James Gang on \\"Funk 50,\\" which has a bluesy electric guitar riff that will sound truly sweet to any J-Gang fans out there.  (Although the song is VERY short - less than two minutes!)  So while I'll be among the first to recognize this Analog Man is far from perfect, I still thought it was an enjoyable listen.  Besides, solo Walsh albums rarely come out any more.  The last was 20 years ago.  And Jeff Lynne's work is pretty rare these days, too.  So I'm glad to take what I can get.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the games and the challenge of earning enough points to unlock other games. My husband hates it. Cannot stand all the ads and thinks most of the games are mindless. So I split the difference and gave it 3 stars. I really think it depends on what kind of games you like. Also, it's not like you paid any money if you don't like it uninstall it.

0345803507|5.0|The third book was undoubtedly the best of all three! The drama, the intimacy, the twists helped combine the story line in a non-stop, can't seem to put it down read.
B0063GORYU|4.0|its the same as the computer... not a bad game... I just don't like the fact that the cards don't go exactly where I try to place them...
0439023513|5.0|I think that this book basically highlights how shallow we all are. If you loved the first two books for the pulse-pounding action and stirring love triangle, and disliked this book for being \\"boring\\", then you are part of the problem. If you loved Katniss for being a badass in the arena, and disliked her for being \\"whiny\\" in this book, then you are part of the problem.<br /><br />You are not part of the problem if you thought the first two books were horrifying and upsetting visions of our future, and didn't want an epic popcorn adventure in this book. You are not part of the problem if you loved Katniss as a character, as a person, and pitied her for the trauma she was put through throughout the novels, and thus could understand her behavior in the third book.<br /><br />This is exactly what SC is writing against. How desensitized we are to violence, how we've come to see violence as a sort of entertainment, and how we voyeuristically take an interest in the personal/romantic affairs of people, be it celebrities or fictional characters (forming \\"teams\\"). How we take an impassive view towards the lives of people who are different from us, or are in a situation that we can't imagine ourselves in. We are the Capitol audience.<br />A good way to appreciate the book is to understand that the series was never about the Games in the first place. It was about making commentary, to make young people think about the state of our society and the nature of war. I think it was a bit of a bold move on Collins' part, because she was writing for the sake of illustrating tough themes that not everyone would take well. She wasn't writing for maximum audience appeal.<br /><br />I personally thought the second book was the worst. It had the best storytelling, but it had the weakest themes. I thought this one was the second best, because it had the strongest themes but the weakest storytelling. (Collins has a bit of an annoying habit of invoking unforeshadowed plot points, like Castor/Pollux being able to navigate the tunnels and President Snow using poison to assassinate his political enemies.) I thought the first book was the best, because it had sort of an equal balance between solid storytelling and themes.<br /><br />That's just my take on it./Pollux being able to navigate the tunnels and President Snow using poison to assassinate his political enemies.) I thought the first book was the best, because it had sort of an equal balance between solid storytelling and themes.<br /><br />That's just my take on it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great plot! Like Brave New World in 1931 and 1984 in 1949, The Hunger Games is the dystopia of its age. Government is overarching and oppressive (of course, how else can an overarching government behave?). Private enterprise is gone, a despised relic of past democracies. Children are not valued. Unless a person or a prize or an act accrues to President Snow's personal benefit, it's insurrection. The wealth is all spread around--among the Capitol's inhabitants, leaving only a paltry equal share for everybody else.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about Collins' style, meaning sentence structure. While I also stumbled over a few obstructions in the prose, I also stumbled frequently over Aldous Huxley's prose. This isn't a prose poem. Read Wordsworth if you're looking for long poetry. But The Hunger Games is a page-turner with a message.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game my boyfriend was the one who introduced me to this. It is fun fun fun and passes by time. Once you start you're not going to stop.

B00005B5L4|5.0|WoW!  The 5.1 mix of an already incredible album is eargasmic.  Set the volume to a level that you just begin to feel the bassline in your chest and kick back.  It doesn't get much better than this.
0061785652|5.0|I could not put it down once I started. Living close to part of where the plot takes place meakes it all the more exciting. It has been great to read how the characters evolved and to know that the possibilities exist that it all took place in some way shape or form.

0062068423|2.0|I looked forward to reading this, having heard from my brother about the great Norveegian mystery writer. Much to my disappointment, I found this overly-manipulative, exasperating (wait! soon after we discover the murderer, let's run into a pack of children on holiday ambling into the firing line, while a runaway train suddenly appears!) and tiresone: 432 short chapters later, Yo, my friend, who the frick cares..? Spare yourself. This was manipulative sheet!

It has a folk music feel to it and some of the tracks even sound a little bit like Neil Young.  Coming from me, that's a real compliment.  He just keeps getting better.  And what's with the hat, long hair and facial hair?  He looks a little bit like Johnny Depp!  Wow!  I like it!

B0038NN3B4|5.0|I don't eat meat or eggs.  You could say I'm 99% vegan except for wild Alaskan salmon (not farmed fish) once or twice a week.  My reasons are ethical, I don't need meat at the expense of death or suffering to another creature.  My exception for wild salmon?....  1) They're harvested close to the end of their life cycle, and 2) The healthiest people on the planet (think Okinawan or Mediterranean) eat small amounts of animal products, mainly in the form of fish.<br /><br />So how does a 99% vegetarian even consider Atkins?  Because I know it works... when I was a teenager in high school, my step mother was on the old Atkins.  She lost alot of weight (100#).  As a teen (a meat-eater back then), I tried it for about 2 weeks and lost 10 pounds effortlessly.  As I've gotten older, my weight started creeping up despite watching what I ate (no goodies), only whole grain carbs, and diligent daily exercise. Evidently, we become more carb resistant as we age. I heard about The New Atkins, read reviews from some of the vegetarians that had posted, and decided to purchase it.  What an excellent program, much improved from the old Atkins! When you mention Atkins to alot of people, they think bacon, sausages, no vegetables, etc.  I've had to set more than a few people straight that The New Atkins is not like that! Refined carbs are the enemy.  The book brings out that we're all different, some of us are more \\"carb resistant\\" than others, just as some of us may be lactose intolerant.  My husband, for example, has carby, sugary goodness every night before bed and never gains an ounce!<br /><br />The New Atkins starts with an \\"Induction Phase\\" where you limit carbs to 20-25 gms per day.  Basically almost all your carbs come from vegetables (Can you get any healthier than that!?)  Doing the New Atkins as a vegan will take more time and planning, but is completely do-able.  Tofu is big, as well as some of the vegan burgers and soy products.  After a period of time (this depends on theamount of weight you need to lose, your goals, etc) you will start adding more carbs each week until you determine your body's own \\"set point\\".  We're all different, so the amount of carbs needed by each of us varies.<br /><br />I am VERY happy with this book and think everyone should read it!  The research and science regarding a low carb diet is impressive. And what a big plus that the book provides menus for meat eaters as well as vegans/vegetarians! This makes it much easier to follow the program!<br /><br />One last thing:  Did I mention I lost my 5-10# that had been creeping up??? This book has made me much more mindful of the quality and quantity of carbs I eat! Whether you're a vegan or carnivore, if you want to lose weight or improve your diet, The New Atkins is for you!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I enjoy many varieties of music genre.  This is a great CD with wonderful songs when I am in that mood.  Bought it for one song (not really the best idea a lot of times) and have not been disappointed in the other songs too!  Can't say they are my favorites but the song \\"If Today Was Your Last Day\\" is amazing!  It's the song that hooked me on their music to take a moment and listen carefully to their words.  Great song messages in them all!  You won't regret purchasing this one to support these artists!!!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|All everyone talked about was how much it cost and how much it would lose when it opened so no wonder nobody wanted to see it.  Where Avengers cost about the same to make but all anybody every talked about was how much it was going to make.  I hate the news media that always loves to see something fail so they can have a good story to write.  I don't listen to critics.  I do read reviews, but rarely has a review detered me from seeing a movie.  I'm glad I saw this movie.  I loved it!  IT WAS FUN.  I could have done without the 3D but that goes for most movies including the Avengers.  Taylor Kitch has had some bad luck recently which is to bad because he's a great leading man who, though very good looking, never relys on those looks and has no problem making himself look bad.  I even liked Battleship because of him.  I hope his career continues dispite these set backs.  I hope alot of people buy this movie to show those critics they were wrong.  Look at the people reviews online.  Everyone I've talked to that has seen it loved it.  Buy this movie and maybe, just maybe they can make enough money to justify a sequel.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|Frankly I have no idea what some of these reviewers have a problem with. They must have gone to some high end film school, or wish they did. I was hesitant to buy this for some time due to the negative reviews  This is an excellent show to watch, (especially if you went to the concert) I would highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG! These 3 books are absolutely amazing. It is too easy to get wrapped into this story. Its told so well you talk about Ana and Christian like they are real ppl.

Either way LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1455523003|2.0|You look up \\"iconoclast\\" in the dictionary and are likely to find a sneering photo of Hitchens.  I bought this book after seeing him on television a number of times and admiring his \\"take no prisoners\\" rhetorical style.  Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment.  For starters, the book is less than one hundred pages, in large print.  Not the end of the world but the cover price on my paperback edition is $17.95.  I paid less through Amazon, but really?  Eighteen dollars for under a hundred pages?  Finances aside, the book's contents are weak.  Do not get me wrong: I respect Hitchens's willingness to take on the sacred, and I also agree with a number of his conclusions.  But the superficial nature of his arguments is infuriating, even more so because Hitchens is obviously brilliant and the effort seems lazy.  Not recommended unless you are a traditional Catholic who is patient, bored, or angry enough to take on Hitchens's diatribe in a serious manner.
0307341550|4.0|I was optimistic when I read the reviews and this book didn't disappoint.  This dark tale of abuse, betrayal and small-town claustrophobia is well executed and mostly plausible.  I agree with other reviews that the ending was a little weak, but it didn't ruin the book.  For a debut novel from Gillian Flynn, I'm a fan.  Can't wait to read more of her work.
0684803356|4.0|This is a novel about the Spanish Civi War, specifically the story of an American who works with a group of partisans to sabotage a bridge.  The story takes place over three days but the book runs in excess of four hundred pages.  As a result, the pace can get slow at times.  No background is given on the war, but Hemingway's sympathies are clear: the fascists must be defeated, and the worth of personal sacrifices is determined in how they further the greater good.  Hemingway develops some interesting characters, particularly \\"Pablo,\\" a disillusioned partisan leader whose murderous actions in support of a noble cause lead him to alcoholism and defeatism.  The American protagonist is most interesting: a cynic who still believes in a cause outside himself.  The romantic relationship between the American and a Spanish girl was not the novel's strength; Hemingway did not make his career drafting love stories.  Although a bit slow, some of the scenes are fantastic.  In particular, the flashback to the murder of fascist sympathizers in a small village is one of the most horrifying chapters I have ever read.  Likewise, an account of a partisan group's last stand on a hilltop puts most Hollywood action movies to shame.  Liked the book but did not love it.  Probably for people who really dig Hemingway or want a bottom-up look at the Spanish conflict.

B000005Z0G|5.0|This is the album where 2Pac began to find his style. 2Pacalypse Now was his debut LP, and although it is a great album, you can tell that he was searching for his own identity as a rap artists. Then comes his second LP, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...<br /><br />This album was the turning point of Pac's now legendary career. With such hit singles as the brilliant 'Keep Ya Head Up' and the old-school sounding funky track 'I Get Around'. The topics and political debates confronted by Pac on this LP are similar to 2Pacalypse Now as he talks about life in poverty, police brutality etc.<br /><br />Here are my top 5 tracks from the second album by Tupac Shakur:<br /><br />1. Keep Ya Head Up (a top 5 2Pac track without question. Pac raps about how to treat and love our women and to not take advantage of them as we \\"all came from a women\\". A very strong message which shows Pac's sensative side. A classic hip-hop track)<br /><br />2. Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (the title track delivery's perfectly here. A grimmy underground dark beat behind Pac's great lyrics make this a truly great track)<br /><br />3. Papa'z Song (this song features Wycked and Poppi. This track is about how Pac doesn't need or respect his father as he left his mother when Pac was young and never stayed in touch. A powerful song which i'm sure many can relate too)<br /><br />4. I Get Around (this was the second single released by Pac on this album. A real 80s hip-hop groove to it which comes of perfectly by Pac along with featured artists on this track Shock G and Money-B)<br /><br />5. Last Wordz (this track features Ice Cube and Ice-T. A very old-school gangster rap style song. Very good track)<br /><br />Overall, this album is essential to 2Pac and hip-hop fans!!

B004TTMYQG|5.0|I was looking for a calendar application that would reliably work with Google.  I have several calendars that overlay and create my schedule.  Many other apps were not reliable for entering and syncing with Google.  I tried the free version of Biz Calendar for a couple days and was immediately sold on its' functionality.  Adding events, viewing, editing is all very straight forward and easy to perform.  I can not emphasize enough how important it is to me that the app performs 100%!  Not only does this app work 100% of the time, it also has a fantastic look and feel.  I highly recommend this and hope it becomes available for my Iphone too!
B006UG90RM|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />I finally got around to buying the new CD.<br /><br />Yep, VH is back in form! Heavy guitar driven tunes, some quite fast! It is not the best David Lee Roth album, but it's not the worse either, which is saying a lot, as all but \\"Diver Down\\" in my opinion, are essential. I'd put it somewhere in the middle. More listens might even move it up a notch?<br /><br />I can't even begin to count all the supposedly back to form albums of many of the 70's heavy metal icons, which were not in the least close to their inspirational days, but \\"A Different Kind of Truth,\\" is the real deal! Not since Mogg/Way ( Phil Mogg & Pete Way members of UFO) \\"Chocolate Box,\\" (1999) have I heard an album so invigorating, or should I say re-invigorating, from legendary 70's heavy metal rockers, though I suppose you could throw in 2002's, Ted Nugent \\"Craveman\\" in there too. \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" is to Van Halen, what \\"Perfect Strangers\\" was to Deep Purple. A band that is once again breathing in their muse, & exhaling sonic bliss. Lets hope it continues!<br /><br />Van Halen lovers, your sonic train has arrived in town. Running right through the station & in to your head, via your ear rails! May VH's whistle blow long & hard!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I find myself completely incapable of finding the right words to describe how the poor quality of this book. After reading the first three chapters (and promptly returning it to Amazon), I am left with an infuriating sense of disbelief: not only that books of this quality are making it onto the bestsellers lists but also that books of this quality are even being published in the first place! I was writing novellas with stronger plots and more developed characters in my freshman year of high school. To add insult to injury, I was experiencing significantly more mature emotions and thought processes than this book's protagonist at that point, as well. I could repeat what others have said, but that would be a waste of time. Simply read the 1 star reviews. They're all on-point. This book is not worth the $10, much less the precious hours of your life you'll spend reading it.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|I got this garbage truck for my son on his third birthday.  He loves trucks and<br />I love the trucks that don't make a ton of noise, but do things that helps<br />him to use his imaginative play skills.  This truck has doors that open to allow<br />his men to get in, trash cans that hook on the back, a dumping knob, and knob<br />that churns the trash.  He loves it!!  I didn't mind spending the $ because I knew<br />it would get hours and hours of play with my two boys.

Mainly because of the movie coming out. I read A Walk to Remember and also show the movie, I loved both. When I read Dear John that's what turned me off of Nicholas Sparks books. However I decided to get him another chance with The Lucky One, and I am glad I did.<br />  Logan Thibault is a former Marine who after a picture in the Iraq desert walks from Colorado to North Carolina in order to find the woman in the photograph that kept him alive.  Logan's character is so real, I mean what's not to love about a Marine who's willing to work across the country to say thank you.<br />  Beth (Elizabeth) Clayton is a single mom trying to raise a son Ben who is your typical ten years old. While helping her grandma (Nana) run a dog kennel. Who cannot get rid of her ex. Keith one of the town's deputy sheriff's.<br />  For a secular novel the book was fairly clean. I do not remember any cuss words in the novel, there were a few scenes where things were implied, but didn't really give too many details are descriptions. I would say that this is a book for adults.

B007ZKY7XO|5.0|The reviews here for this album suprise me.  I myself think it is MUCH better than their previous effort \\"Night Work\\". The lead single \\"Only the Horse\\" is pretty mainstream and it's a shame it isn't a bigger hit (in North America anyway).  Overall great album!

1594745692|5.0|\\"Together, these cards reveal a path forward. Should you stay in your fallout shelter until the last of your supplies are depleted? Flee to one of the government-sponsored refugee camps? Proceed directly to the Gunz-R-Us? Consult the Zombie Tarot to determine the best course of action. These cards can't predict the future, but they can offer you much-needed perspective on a situation. Pay attention to your intuition, listen to your instincts, and always, always keep the shotgun loaded.\\" - From the companion booklet<br /><br />From rotting corpses to severed heads, cannibalistic children to valiant humans fighting for survival, the Zombie Tarot serves up heaping doses of both brawn AND braaaainnnnsss for the twisted seeker.<br /><br />And by brains, I don't (just) mean the kind served fresh out of the cranium: this deck, conceived by Stacey Graham and illustrated by Headcase Design (Paul Kepple and Ralph Geroni), lurches with wit and shambles with pure entertainment.<br /><br />But make no mistake: the Zombie Tarot reads clear and sharp for those used to reading the cards. Yes, it's an actual workhorse deck! (And not just the \\"work\\" of escaping limb-eaters or trying to divine your escape route...)<br /><br />Brought to you buy the same publishers who created the domestically awesome Housewives Tarot (Quirk Books), the Zombie Tarot is every bit as funny, but--dare I say it--is even MORE brilliant!<br /><br />Framed by what looks like yellowed, old-fashioned newsprint, each card of morbid hilarity offers traditional names for the Major Arcana, while the Minor Arcana finds expression through Cups, Swords, Wands and Hazards (Coins). The Court Cards are Pages, Knights, Queens and Kings (love that rifle-toting Queen of Swords grandma luring zombies with a well-heeled ankle smack-dab in the middle of a bear trap!).<br /><br />The 96-page companion booklet offers five spreads, as well as three keywords and brief interpretation for each card (the \\"ads\\" in the back are too funny!). Labeled \\"Prediction and Protection\\", the sturdy Zombie Tarot container will serve you well...since it doubles for a box of shells!<br /><br />Here are a few card descriptions to give you flavor of this fantastic flesh-fest:<br /><br />Justice: Impartiality*Fairness*Equality - \\"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\\" takes on an entirely new meaning in the midst of a human-zombie war. Thankfully you can count on Justice to right the wrongs, restore harmony, and offer a karmic slap to the back of the head to those who deserve it. Fight the good fight--don't be on the other end of that slap.<br /><br />Six of Cups: Nostalgia*Memories*Old Flames - Ahh, the carefree days of childhood! No zombie plagues, no hiding in abandoned houses, and your best friend was always at your side. Well, there's good news: someone from your past may soon arrive for a visit. Just don't mistake a friendly kiss on the cheek for a zombie gnawing off your face.<br /><br />Eight of Wands: Travel*Expansion*On the Move - Faster than you can say...well, most anything, since you've lost your tongue, you've been presented with a new opportunity. Travel is imminent, so choose a path to stagger along and enjoy the occasional human morsel as you go. If you take charge, others will follow your lead. Trust your inner zombie and roll with it. Good news is coming. Brace yourself for awesome.<br /><br />While the companion book is whip-smart, the images, too, show depth of Tarot knowledge. The Queen of Swords is often known as the \\"silver-haired widow card\\", so it's no surprise that our gun-wielding granny waits patiently in her green armchair. The 4 of Hazards, usually referred to as the \\"miser card\\", shows a smug human surrounded by food staples--fingers in his ears to drown out the cries of his fellow survivors outside, desperate for sustenance.<br /><br />Justice's scales carry a brain on one side and a heart on the other, the balance decidedly in favor of the mind (as Justice usually tips). Thezombie gal on the 8 of Wands chases her prey on roller skates, a clever nod to the \\"speed\\" of this card. Temperance shows its alchemical roots with a bloody microscope slide and syringe. And the 3 of Swords? Let's just say this card brings new meaning to \\"eat your heart out\\"....<br /><br />Every Tarot lover must have the Zombie Tarot, pure and simple. It satisfies on every level: artistic, esoteric and divinatory. Yes, it's a riot and yes, it's gross--but it's a solid reading deck for those familiar with the cards. Even if you're clueless about the Tarot but love zombies, this is one purchase that should be a no brainnnnnn-er.<br /><br />-- Janet Boyer, author of Back in Time Tarotzombie gal on the 8 of Wands chases her prey on roller skates, a clever nod to the \\"speed\\" of this card.

0345803507|4.0|How can she just leave us hanging with Christian's POV! I LOVED reading what was going on in HIS head!!! UGH! it's so frustrating. The trilogy was alright, not the best or most raved about books in my opinion. Too much repetition...TOO MUCH! At one point you'll be thinking, JEEZ I GOT IT, DAMN LETS FIND SOME OTHER THINGS TO SAY WHILE HAVING SEX! =) It's great, but I thought she could have been a little more realistic about situations and with characters. In general, MEN do NOT act like christian grey. I know this is fiction, but it would be great if guys wrote guy parts in romance novels and girls wrote girl parts. THAT would be realistic! Over all, the second book was TOO lovey dovey and annoying but I enjoyed the 1st and 3rd book...

B005TQACLC|3.0|I was seven years old when I first saw the video for \\"...Baby One More Time.\\" From that moment on, I've been obsessed with this chick!! The awesome outfits, amazing dancing, flawless music, and her beauty! Who didn't fall in love?! I bought into the \\"Britney Brand\\" her and her management have created from day one. I stayed up to date with all the current Britney news and what not. I even stuck around when she married, had two kids, divorced, went a tad bit crazy, and returned to fame. I admit, she's not the same! In some ways, she's better! In others, she's not the same!I was first disappointed of the release of \\"Blackout.\\" It has never been my favorite album. It's grown on me since, but I feel it's not up to par with her last efforts. Also, I don't care for \\"dance music.\\" Her lack of promotion. I was disappointed that she just doesn't care anymore. I was very excited about \\"Circus.\\" One of my favorite Britney albums. It was an actual pop album. Some catchy songs, some ballads, a general theme.  Completely disappointed by lack of promotion for that album as well! At first, she did interviews, performances, and came out of her shell a bit. Then she never did anything else with promotion besides the \\"Circus Tour.\\" Let me tell you! That tour, I wanted to me absolutely amazed! I expected her dancing, high energy, and amazing smile. Nothing! Now, it's another \\"dance album.\\" A bit better than \\"Blackout,\\" but even more auto tuned!? Seeing the videos on Youtube for \\"The Femme Fatale Tour\\" I was unbelievably impressed and relieved! She was dancing actual choreography! Singing live!!! Had a big more energy! When the dvd was released from Epix, I ran straight to the store! Watched the dvd a few times. Was satisfied even though the show was dubbed over. After a few watches, I became bored. The dvd is crap! I can't believe after ten years of not having a concert dvd, this is what we get! I'm almost to the point of never purchasing another Britney item again! Her next efforts have got to be fierce and flawless! This is coming from a HUGE fan! But I'm getting tired of this!!
B0086700CM|4.0|A friend recommended this game to me, and I love playing it. It is fun and fast-paced, and even a bit stressful as it moves SO FAST as you progress.<br /><br />For the first few weeks, I was frustrated because I would see objectives (sort of like challenges in many apps) that mentioned things that I couldn't find explained anywhere in the game--like there being multiple characters vs. just the one you see when you start playing the game, and how to resurrect your player after he dies. Then a Facebook friend told me that these are utilities that are on the store menu but you have to scroll down to see them. All that time I had been looking at everything I could find in the game for documentation and never saw the rest of that menu! So I thought I would include that in my review to try to help others who may not have realized at first that the store menu is multiple pages.<br /><br />Fun game, highly recommended!<br /><br />UPDATED 6/20/12:<br />1. I have revised my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars ONLY because after playing the game for several weeks and and advancing quite a bit, I hit a wall and was unable to get even close to the 5k run that would be required to meet the last bunch of objectives (I've already completed the rest). Even with resurrection wings, I can't get much past 3k yet. The wings only last 30 seconds, and even if I wait well into my run to activate them, they seem to expire before I need them more often than not. I expect that, with more time, I will break this barrier...but I feel that there could have been more mid-level objectives in the meantime vs. jumping up to 5k and millions of points needed to complete them.<br /><br />2. Some of the 1-star reviews for this game say it is impossible to play the game without spending real money. Don't believe it. I played the game almost a month without ever spending a cent of my own money. I earned a 10,000 coin new character, a 5000 coin screen saver and nearly maxed out all the powerups JUST USING COINS EARNED BY PLAYING THE GAME. If you want everything on the first day then, yes, prepare to pay for it. But if you are patient, these things can all be earned within a few weeks.EARNED BY PLAYING THE GAME.

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|It seems unavoidable and imperative:  all critics must be forced into some other line of work every second year, if only to cleanse a bit of their nearly unending cynicism.  They try so hard for erudition, yet end up sounding strangely bitter.<br /><br />Case in point:  comparing \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" to films of this story that have come before, most notably the Disney version.  This is how classics are told for this generation, so let it be told!  Many got stuck with an actor's performance or some plot or visual element that distracted them from how they remember the story.  Never the way to have a good time at the movies.<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is a rousing - and moving - update of this staid but beautiful 200-year-old classic.  It even has positive messages for the kids; if you pay attention (as I think girls especially will).  Out of my personal five-star scale, I would give it a very strong 4.0.<br /><br />If you can let go of such preconceptions - as you should whenever you go to the movies - you're going to have a GREAT time seeing \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\"!  It's got a bit of everything for just about everyone.  It's exciting, with some truly scary parts, and some genuinely beautiful scenes.  Mostly, I loved it for its genuine heart; something we don't often see in summer blockbusters!  Enjoy.

What's truly amazing, other than the impeccable songwriting, is the performance.  These harmonies would be amazing by 20somethings, but for 60somethings, it verges on supernatural.<br /><br />Perhaps they had some digital help, but it doesn't matter.  It's a joy to listen to this album and despite the loss of Carl and Dennis, Brian has his songwriting and producing powers intact.  Bravo.

B005C7SXMS|5.0|\\"Submarine\\" is a very entertaining film with fantastic atmosphere, good performances and a very clever, and self aware script.  Produced by Ben Stiller from a novel ([[ASIN:0812978390 Submarine: A Novel (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)]]) by Joe Dunthorne, one can see what attracted Stiller to this project.  Ayoade does a good job of directing, with editing, production design, and shots that capture the story's  knowing and sardonic tone.  Sally Hawkins is as always fantastic as our hero's mother, but the entire cast is excellent, Yasmin Page in particular as the ambivalent center of of his romantic initiation.  4.5 stars.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I was in the mood for comedy and Woody Allen's latest movie \\"Midnight in Paris\\" seemed to be an obvious choice for the evening entertainment.  His movies in the last several years never let me down and I was looking forward to his new shot at comedy.  In this film there is assembly of great actors who give fabulous performances and their renditions of famous people who lived in Paris in 1920s: Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Gertrude Stein, Matisse, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, to name a few.  The main character is an American Holywood screenplay writer on his trip to Paris daydreaming about abandoning his life in Malibu for a cozy little attic apartment in Paris.  Surely, his American fiancee, does not feel the same.  She just cannot comprehend why woudl anyone abandon big house in Malibu for small attic in Paris.  If American in Paris is a culture clash, than match between this Holywood screenwriter and his fiancee is definitely not match made in haven.<br /><br />Surely, Woody uses his alter ego in this new character of a writer and it fits the story perfectly.  Owen Wilson is perfect choice for the role.  Supporting cast includes: Marion Cottilard, Carla Bruni. Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Michael Sheen to name a few.  Story is absolutely original and it is both funny and smart.  I enjoyed every moment of it.  From wonderful dialogues to most beautiful scenes of Paris.

1603427244|5.0|There's a book upcoming in August I believe that promises 211 cast on and bind offs. While I wait for that I thought I'd check this one out!<br /><br />First, it's a tidy, squarish book, 6 x 7 or so inches, just the right size to tuck in a knitting bag and it's not only spiral bound to lay nice and flat it's safety bound--so no weird bits from the binding to snag your knitting or yarn!<br /><br />There's a quicky index on the inside covers of the book--cast ons in front, bind offs in back. For example, the headers for bind offs are: All purpose, lace, decorative, stretchy ribbed, and specific use.  So if you're, say, knitting that toe up sock,, you know which section you will want to hit.<br /><br />There's a brief tutorial about things you'll need to know for the techniques--such as what knitwise or purlwise are, so it's very beginner friendly.<br /><br />Each technique has a picture that cleverly shows rightside/wrongside of the work, a close up of the edge, and characteristics and what it is good for, followed by a step by step, with lots of color photographs, and then a box called 'getting it right' to help troubleshoot.<br /><br />All in all this is a great step for a beginning knitter to up her or his game, and a really handy resource for any knitter to tuck in the bag.  It's designed to be a reference source, used and used again.

If I hadn't read the story first, I may have enjoyed the movie a lot more. The movie is action packed, but that was not enough to make up for the poor interpretation of the book. I saw the movie at the $2 theater and still felt I overpaid. If you want to gain some enjoyment from the movie, don't read the book first or you will be sorely disappointed.

The preview should be able to move around to able to keep the main image up as you solve the puzzle. very  cute game all in all. helps kill time and you get that feeling of accomplishment when one is finished. lots of free puzzle packs to download.

0061478784|5.0|I have been a fan of Diana Wynne Jones for such a long time, I cannot even remember when I picked up my first book by her (though I can remember that book was The Year of the Griffin). So when I saw a commercial years ago for Miyazaki's version of Howl's Moving Castle I almost fainted, as I was obsessed with him at the time, the same time I considered Wynne my ultimate favourite author. Of course at the time I hadn't actually gotten to reading Howl's Moving Castle (Wynne has written a lot of books), but because of the movie, the idea of reading it got planted in my head.<br /><br />When I eventually first read the book I was blown away by just how good it was, just how much better it was than the movie (although I love that as well), to the point where the magic of the movie just doesn't hit me, because the book has it amplified. So when I had a chance to actually purchase a copy of the book, I jumped.<br /><br />I began to reread this book this time around because none of the books I had on hand were good before bed. To begin with I love Wynne's prose style, it is the epitome of comfort read for me, and a joy to read out loud to others. Sophie as a character is very sensible, in fact she's too sensible, so sensible it gets her into trouble, because she lets herself get trapped into situations that she could easily get out of. She is the eldest sister so all lore tells her she shall make nothing of herself is she tries to make for her fortune, but then she is forced to do just that when the Witch of the West comes around for some reason and curses Sophie with an old woman's body.<br /><br />As soon as she leaves she ends up with the wicked Howl and that's where things of course get good. Being an old woman gives Sophie a burst of confidence to show her true personality (instead of just being sensible) and she bullies her way into the hearts of the characters who live with Howl. These characters are also a joy. Having read the Chrestomanci books now, Howl reminds me a lot of flamboyant Christopher Chant, and the connection between worlds also seems like an echo of that idea.<br /><br />The plot is also so layered and complicated, yet is told so simply that it boggles my mind and is a show to Wynne's genius.<br /><br />--<br /><br />If you loved the Miyazaki's movie, you need to read this book. It has the magic of the book multiplied by about a hundred. If you love prose in the style of Diana Wynne Jones or Patricia C. Wrede, you need to pick up this book because it is just in that style while being a masterful fantasy storya lot of flamboyant Christopher Chant, and the connection between worlds also seems like an echo of that idea.<br /><br />The plot is also so layered and complicated, yet is told so simply that it boggles my mind and is a show to Wynne's genius.<br /><br />--<br /><br />If you loved the Miyazaki's movie, you need to read this book.

B0086700CM|5.0|ive been wanting this game for ages and now that I have it for the kindle I play it all the time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. Its basically just like Mario Bros. Great game. One of the best. :p
B00785P2QC|5.0|addictive. great graphics on my kindle fire. game moves at good pace all around good game easy to comrehend cant wait for more
0679805273|5.0|Purchased as graduation gift. Originally a graduation speech turned into a book. Inspirational, life has its bumps for everyone to work through to get to where they are going.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|The Hunger Games (fascinating)the characters well fleshed out but slowly. I did not like the abrupt ending to the 3rd book but I had to concede there was no better way.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|ok, let me start by saying this: sure, maybe its not as good at the first one. maybe the first cut the rope was more &quot;original&quot;  or more &quot;simple&quot; or whatever floats ur boat. but this one brings an originality of its own. there's a whole new story, whole new levels, whole new &quot;inventions&quot; you have to get past. and whether its hard or not is ur opinion. just remember 1 thing. this is a VERY good app. considering the other apps such as the &quot;BLEEP&quot; button and the various ghost radar apps, this is in my top favorites by far. :) GO CUT THE ROPE!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love these kind of building games. I really like how you can still earn money when your not playing.  I wish it would tell you how much the upgrades are on the buildings
B0086700CM|5.0|the best part about this game (besides the crazy amazing graphics and creative concept) is definatly that it has no end. i had to sit through a 4 hr graduation and a little kid beside me played it for the whole time. it looked fun, so i tried it. i now consider myself officially addicted. :)
B0045EA1P6|5.0|Wonderful cd to listen to, a new sound and a pleasant one too! Found this album while listening to the latest one. It's nice to hear some real lyrics and meaningful songs that don't just repeat one word a million times.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely llloooovvvvveeee this game.. its soooo  addicting.. it is so much fun to play.. I am so glad that someone invented it..
B007SGM084|5.0|Getting the trilogy bundle was a great idea when ordering these Kindle books. I must say I didn't know what to expect when I ordered them, but I did enjoy the trip these books provided. Will there be a 4th?
B004ZN9YNC|3.0|Yo.  Final Cut.<br />PF! This is how we're going out!<br />No doubt.  La, La, La....<br />Listened to this bad boy on the way to work for the first time in 18 years.<br />Sweeter than ever.<br />If you're feeling a one man rock opera...<br />Which I was this morning.<br />I was almost in tears.<br />Trying to sing along like the Rodge in my car.<br />Cracking my voice just like in highschool.<br /><br />I've grown to get sick of all Pink Floyd after Meddle (except Animals)<br />Even Meddle hurts me a bit, but this is worth revisiting.<br /><br />The Gills shows up every once in a while and rips the worst solos ever.<br />The Gills may have been the worst guitar player working in the world at that time.<br />Holy teardrop cheese.<br /><br />And bros, bros, bros...the last tune.<br />Mad sweet.  Mad emotional.  Bringing me right back.<br />With a smile on the highway at 7am...<br /><br />Until that saxophone drops hard for the last few measures...<br />Holy wow!<br />I can see why the saxophone was abandoned as an instrument.<br />Is the Gills playing that?<br />Sounds like his weak teardrop solos...<br />Sounds like the Saturday Night Live Intro...<br />I can see the Gills right now...<br /><br />\\"Yo. Rodge.  If this is gonna be a PF release let me drop a mad sax bomb to end it all...\\"<br />\\"All right dude, but them I'm out...\\"<br /><br />Hell no we won't go.<br />Hell no we won't go.<br />We don't need your saxophone.<br />We don't want your saxophone.<br /><br />Please don't play the saxophone Gills! or anybody.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was doubtful of this book to start with but the first five chapters gripped me and I couldn't put it down. After one week of reading all three books I had no sleep and had to charge my kindle twice! Some people feel that the main character is a little cold but there is a surprising back story you wont want to miss. The sheer amount of emotions sprawled through out these books are ones that most of us can connect with. I look forward to more books from this author.
B002SQFZ68|5.0|Very pleased, excellent show, Bon Jovi is a great band.<br />Image quality and the songs are very good,<br />I love Bon Jovi!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|the game is challenging and fun no need to drop the cash but is buggy and locks up please fix that
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White<br />Bluderbuss<br />Third Man/Columbia<br /><br />It's with good reason Jack White's debut solo effort spent the first couple weeks on top of the Billboard chart. He really stepped up his songwriting skills with the studio of musicians he had. Courtesy of Wu Tang's RZA absence at the time the session players were on the clock. So, Jack White just started ripping out on tunes and put the lot of them to work. This is also white's debut release on his Third Man Records, based in Nashville, TN. While, not being the guitar-driven album many White Stripe fans would expect. This album's more about the songs, and White spends a lot of studio time banging on the piano, his second favorite passion. Almost reminiscent of Get Behind Me Satan, which may have been a little premature for The White Stripes. But, nessecary for the growing and maturing process.<br />  The first single is an acoustic ditty titled \\"Love Interruption,\\" and is complete with soul, and great accompanying vocals by Ruby Amanfu. It's simple but in depth at the same time. The true mark of brilliance in creating melodies. The title track has really got the music environs of Nashville being absorbed by the lofty melody. It also clearly reveals White's superb story-telling skills. He pulls you further into his intentions and intimate mental notes.<br />  Like \\"Wild Orchid\\" on the aforementioned Get Behind Me Satan, \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" is the big rock-hook number. Would even be a solid track for the next single. It's tight, concise and hits hard on the head. The lead break in \\"Freedom At 21\\" is some of White's most inspired work, and he seems to be able to manipulate that lead break with some slick little Pro-Tool's program. It's just enough, not being over the top.<br />Gigz Giger
0385341008|5.0|Based on the title, I would never have picked up this book (I kept forgetting it!!) But it was chosen for book club, and so I started. By page 20, I was totally drawn in, and could not put it down. Wonderful story telling- of spirit, kindness, morality, and survival. Has enough historical facts to be non-fiction, but an excellent read as a fiction book. This book soothes the soul!
0061692042|5.0|Having read all of his novels, one can not help but conclude that with \\"Canada\\" Mr. Ford has created a masterwork that surpasses all of his other fictional works as well as the fabulous pleasures he has created for us with his Frank Bascombe suburban epic trilogy. Dell's authentic voice and the unusual narrative tale he tells in \\"Canada\\" connects on so many levels that you know his Dell the way you come to know Harper Lee's Scout in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" as someone whose transformation is intimate, deeply felt, and enduring for as long as you live.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|A really good album from a really good band. Probably the best rock album of the year. It feels like a cross between Lucky Old Sun and Beach Boys 85.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|I guess I'm just a kid at heart. I had seen the movie a long time ago & remembered it as being very cleverly done & very funny.  What an imagination the artists have!Just as good the second time around. Not just for the young! -
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|it comes in a simple case that only has the movie, but what else where you buying? its simplistic packaging takes nothing away from how epic of a movie this is. on blu-ray it looks amazing and buying any less would put all the efforts to draw each cell of this movie to waste. this movie is good and worth the price.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it.... very addict game...got keep going to unlock all the items....have it on my kindle fire ... would recommend this game..
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I heard a lot about this book, thought it would be a good read. I am not a big reader but when i find something I like and is interesting to me such as \\"The Shack\\" which I loved loved loved it. This book is a lot of hype. I do have to agree with some of the other people who gave reviews. I know this is a book a story. But a lot of this is BS. She can say the word F*** a few times but can not say and put pen to paper and write P****, or even the work d***. The words she put into the novel is so weird at times. The girl turns a crimson, or different shades of what ever coler. Just use the word red, or blush, beet red would be good.<br />Its a good love story but to a point. A self made billionaire by the age of 26 who was abuses by his mom's pimp burned with cigerettes and adopted by rick lawyer/dr parents. Who loves to inflick pain on someone cause it turns him on, but no one is allowed to touch him. Im guess because he was touched and burned and abused as a 4 yr old child. Its good and not good. I have read book one all the way through. I wish book 2 would be different. I don't know. But they do have a lot of sex he likes to f her hard. He can have sex with her with her period and no condom but no period he needs a condom cause he don't want to get her pregant?? Do some research, it can happen. A woman can get pregnant while on her period if she has sex with a man, as much as they do. He seems to know a lot about a woman and don't mind taking out her tampon to lick her sex. Come one now how old is this writer??? She can't say the word P**** but she can say F*** pretty much as often as they have sex. Which is pretty much all day and night between naps and eating and drinking. Everthing turns them both on as quick as that. The attitudes and arquing between them is so bad, just get to the point and let him answer the dam question. Have way to many pages of asking questions that don't get answered. He is a 26 yr old having unlimited sex with a 21 yr virgin (vanilla sex)and he knows what he wants and controls everything he sees a therapists to get help but still wants to inflick pain on someone else. IF he didn't like the pain why do it to someone else. Not because it turns you on. I guess he got a hard on when his mom pimp was abusing him and burning him. He has enough sense to know a lot but not to try and love and share his life with someone like Anatasia? Come on James the writer. Not so good of you. Good story in a small way but other things needed changing. Really not such a good read. Try try try again

B007U1FEJE|5.0|What a wonderful treat! I don't want to hear any whining about the lack of Dennis, or especially Carl vocals. Folks this is The Beach Boys 2012! Time moves on, but fortunately they've managed to reclaim that instantly recognizable sound with those gorgeous harmony stacks. This is really a beautiful gift because no sane person wanted The Beach Boys recording legacy to end with Stars and Stripes Vol. 1. The first part of the album is sort of the single-y section. Instantly hooky. Next up we've got Jimmy Buffett city - lush and beautiful. Finally, we end on the jaw-dropping suite (which is easily the best part of the album). Folks, From There to Back Again is as good as anything in the canon. It's that amazing. Al is the secret weapon. Buy this thing today. If we throw enough money at the Boys maybe they'll finally record that rock and roll album Brian's wanted to make for the last 10+ years :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|yeah! yipee! awesome! its so cool. I mean cool. yeah yeah yeah yeah. cool. its so cool I feel like I'm gonna lee my pants.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|The beloved world of fairy tales have always had a back story to them. We never knew what they were till now. Who really is Rumpelstiltskin?? Who was the man in the mirror mirror on the wall? What happened to Pinocchio when he grew up to be a man?? This TV show was amazing!!! And im proud to buy my first ever television series ever on a bluray format and dvd. Thank you for making such an amazing story! Cannot wait for season 2!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite game to pass the time, even just for fun it is great and rather addicting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a media specialist and read so many books, I rarely have time to rate them on public forums. And this isn't even a review but a gushing appreciation for the story I just read. As I posted to my pals on Facebook \\"If you have any plans for a productive weekend, keep your sticky fingers far away from this book\\". It is true. I read when I should have been working, sleeping, cleaning, etc. Blearily, I finished at 4:30 am this morn and although a bit sad it is over, am delighted there is more to come from this stellar, talented author. Mr. Howey, I don't know how much longer you can read all of these reviews, but if you do, here is a big thank you and WOW for coming up with such a great story and likable characters...your insight and imagination are genius. I am staggered how you could write just one story and then turn it into what you did. I am always sad about the great classic reads I will miss out on when I die, and very, very happy this came along during my lifetime.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its an awesome game for chess lover's and it doesn't madder how good or bad you are its either hard or it can be really easy for early players.!!!!
1466401885|5.0|I think it's a sweet \\"tame the wild man\\" sort of book. What girl doesn't want to think she is special?
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The characters, the scenes, the sound all come alive while watching the Sound of Music on Blu-Ray. It is a blessing to be able to still have the usage of my 5 senses because all appear to interact with the production of this classic.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I love it! best game ever!! you should get it!!! amazing awesome cute fun!!! it is worth buying!!!!!!!! love it!!
0399230033|5.0|My 18 months old daughter loves the book. I specially like it that there are not many wording there, but the pictures are so great that parents can make stories about them. Although the story may be slightly different every time, but that adds to the excitement!
0345803485|4.0|50 shades had me blushing way before the first sex scene. Not something to read at work or in public if your a little on the timid side, but I couldn't put it down. Your either going to love it or hate it....There is a great story behind all the erotic details...Thankful for my Kindle because the last page is a real cliffhanger (apparently there will be more ana and christian).... On to Fifty Shades Darker!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Enjoy playing this game with friends.  I like the improvement of recently adding a notification that the opponent has played.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome and amazing.you must try this game people.  you will love it do it do it do it - Hayden Huntley. just do it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There is absolutely no reason that any person with a blu ray player shouldn't have these movies as part of their collection.  Beyond the great story, the re-mastering that has taken place on the original trilogy makes it look better than most movies released today!  Absolute must buy!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|A friend of mine recommended that I see this movie & I'm so glad that she did, 'cause it's become one of my favorite movies.  I love this movie for many reasons: One is the cast, especially Annasophia Robb, who plays Bethany Hamilton and Lorraine Nicholson, who plays Bethany's friend, Alana Blanchard(those two actresses work well together and play their characters to perfection!).  I also love the fact that the entire movie was shot on location in Hawaii and it makes you feel like you're there.  Another thing that I like is that the whole Hamilton family was there during the filming of the movie and Bethany did all the one-armed surfing stunts.  I also love how, despite her injury, Bethany was able to be determined to be able to surf, again, which leads to the message that the movie brings that, despite difficult times, good things can come out because Rick Allen, drummer for the British heavy metal band, Def Leppard, lost his left arm in a car accident in '84, but he enventually came back and, through the use of electronics & foot pedals, he was able to  play drums, again, with one arm.  Not only do I love this movie for those reasons, while I'm not an emotional guy when I watch movies, there's about 5 or 6 scenes that make me want to burst into tears.  I think Bethany is a good, strong-hearted person and I'd love to meet her one day.  To sum it up, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves surfing, good family movies, or both 'cause, believe me, this movie is WONDERFUL!
0393088774|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A TERRIFIC READ. NO ONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON WITH OUR ECONOMY SHOULD MISS READING THIS WELL-WRITTEN AND CONCISE BOOK. IT MAKES ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THE PATH WE MUST TAKE. LET'S DO IT!

B0086700CM|4.0|I think that they should have made this a long time ago for fire besides that I love this app
B007R9MFPU|5.0|It is so refreshing to have new material by my all-time favorite band. Although Brilliant is currently unavailable through Amazon (\\"Out Of Stock\\"), I have listened to the title track and samplings from all of the other tracks. There is already an excellent fan-made video for the song Brilliant.<br /><br />Based on the title track, this is classic Ultravox: Swirling melodies and keyboards, lush production, soaring vocals, intriguing lyrics. It's all there for the established Ultravox fan, and new listeners as well.<br /><br />If you are a big fan from back in the day, you are no doubt buying this CD regardless of any reviews.<br /><br />My greatest hope is that the band will tour the US in support of this new CD as well as their amazing catalog of classics.

B007SGM084|5.0|I read all three books in a week, then re-read them.<br /><br />The characters were wonderful.<br /><br />The moods and emotions of Christian came across strongly; I hurt for him when he struggled with expressing or explaining to Ana why certain things were just plain hard limit for him.<br /><br />Ana's character developed from innocence to well-educated but she also had so much compassion for Christian.  I enjoyed \\"watching\\" her confidence in herself grow as she grew to love Christian \\"unconditionally.\\"
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app!Also it is very appropriate for all ages.There are so many different outcomes and upgrades you can get.All in all it is a very fun and entertaining app.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the one app ive been waiting for I love this game.best game ever. if there were would be 6 stars I would put 6 that's how good this game is.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|How DID people give this 4 and 5 stars.  The movie was boring, ugly, terrible cinematography.  The acting was actually pretty good, but WHY would ANYONE want to watch something so very depressing.  My husband and I agree completely with the prior reviewer who said \\"we need to talk about getting our money back\\".  Positively horrid movie.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|I bought this because my boyfriend and I are avid Assassin's Creed players and he hinted that he wanted this one (and the younger version) for his birthday. Now that his birthday has come and gone, he really enjoys having this. The packaging was good, presentable if you too want to give it as a gift, and easy enough to open. The figure itself is highly detailed, down to the embroidery of his cloak that was painted. The movement of his limbs are a bit tough like the other actions figures; his arms and wrists stick or lock up sometimes so just be gentle when you change his poses. The clothing is as accurate as possible to the game from what I could tell. Overall, its a great \\"toy\\" to put on a display case, add to a collection, or to have guarding over your computer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|(Spoiler Alert) Usually I can find something I like about a book, but this book was so juvenile, redundant, and unbelievable that I could not find anything redeeming about it. Let's start with Ana - who has waited until graduation from college to lose her virginity and she loses it to a guy she's just met in a blah get it over with manner? Okay, lets say I buy into that, but then she goes from Ms. virgin to Ms. nympho in a a matter of a day? \\"Oh my.\\" And on top of that, she has low self-esteem issues, but her inner goddess, who has no issues whatsoever (insert eye roll here and hope Christian doesn't spank me)wins every time against her issued filled subconscious who hates her. Yes that's right, all Ana needs to do is have mind blowing sex with Christian and all problems are solved.\\"Oh my.\\" Lastly, with regards to Ana, she gets mad over the stupidest things - for example: it's okay for Christian to want to put the smack down, just don't buy her anything. This whole \\"mad cycle\\" is rinse and repeat through the entire story (And the two other books).<br /><br />Next, there's Christian... the 27 year old billionaire who is perfect in every way as long as you over look his misogynist tendencies and the mommy issues. \\"Oh my.\\" As unbelievable as Ana is, this guy is even less believable due mainly because he's billed as an alpha male when really he's just an a**hole. \\"Oh my.\\" It's hard to believe this guy has been as successful as he is when he's suppose to still be highly traumatized by something that happened to him when he was four years old. \\"Oh my.\\" Then there's the whole gimmick surrounding Christian - his eyes are gray, his last name is grey and he's fifty shades of grey - I only counted two by the way. When he's not having sex with Ana, or chasing Ana down, or making Ana eat, he's sending her obsessive e-mails and text messages and that's really all there is to him.<br /><br />This brings me to the storyline in its entirety -  he's mad have sex, she's mad have sex,they're okay have sex and repeat. \\"Oh my.\\" It got seriously old by the halfway mark. Even before learning this story started off as twilight fan fiction, the whole premise of awkward girl meets \\"perfect\\" boy with issues and falls in love with boy anyway and boy spends next several chapters saving girl and boy and girl ride off into the sunset with no real resolution for said issues in sight was easy enough to spot just a few short pages in. \\"Oh my.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and if you got sick of reading \\"oh my\\" throughout this review, then this is not the book for you. \\"Oh my.\\"
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Not for the dance crowd or those driven to depression by reality, Cohen weaves his varied magic on the major themes - troubled love, aging and mortality - all in his accustomed poetic style. Does anyone expect less from one of the major lyricists?  This gentleman has been wronged more than a few times and is wearying of the footrace. He has excellent backing musicians here, totally free of bombast.  I still haven't tired of listening and have had the CD for a couple of months.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|This book is about murder. Granted, it's the bad guys who are being murdered but nontheless.  The author is one who revels in his accomplishments.  I suspect that he will have some serious problems adjusting to a world without killing.<br /><br />28 March 2014  See, I told you so.
0297859382|5.0|I have no idea how to review this book without inadvertently revealing something that will spoil it for a reader, so it may be the shortest review I have written in a while.<br /><br />After a slightly slow start I was gripped by this chilling, tangled tale of love, hate and revenge. The plot is complex yet startlingly simple on reflection. The twists are incredible, lulled into believing one thing, I actually drew in a breath of shock each time Flynn flipped the direction of the story on its head. Flynn plays brilliantly on our own prejudices about class, marriage, money, domestic violence and infidelity and delves deeply into the psyche of two ordinary yet shocking personalities.<br /><br />Just as I thought I had a handle on the characters of Amy and Nick, I would be side swiped by a revelation I hadn't considered. What you think you know about these people, their marriage, their life can never be relied on. Guilt and blame is assigned and then shifted and it isn't until the end you have any idea where you stand, and even then...<br /><br />Brilliant and disturbing in equal measure Gone Girl is an engrossing read, don't be fooled by the brevity of this review - I just don't want to spoil anything for you! Gone Girl won't be for everyone, but I found it simply astonishing.
0345803485|4.0|Good read....stayed interested..some of these reviews seem like book critics (I am sure they're not) BUT hated how it ended so now I have bought the other two books. I am glad I didn't listen to some of these negative reviews.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I haven't even received this DVD/CD, but I know it has to be wonderful....I saw her live for the 5th time last August in Kansas City Mo and, as always, she did not disappoint me.  Hope she goes back on tour before her normal 10 years in between tours.....I cannot get enough of her.

B004JZBGWI|3.0|I liked this app at first but when I accidently put a password on one of my notes I couldn't find a way to delete it so I finally deleted the password and it just deleted all my notes with passwords on them, and if it gave me a warning I didn't see it. It also wouldn't let me turn my Kindle fire sideways so I could type.
0545265355|1.0|The books themselves are quite poor.<br /><br />Let me explain. When I first heard about this series, I was told that it was good, riveting etc. I had rather high expectations for the books. Coming from a background where Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, the Chronicles of Prydain, Redwall etc, are considered good, riveting, well written,  etc., I think I was hoping to be able to add this trilogy to my collection.<br /><br />No dice however. Do not be fooled by the media reviews or Stephen King's praise for the first book only: this series is terrible. King hit the nail on the head when he said that the story of the first book is captivating. You will likely enjoy the story of the first book. I did, despite frequent proofreading mistakes, terrible sentence construction, and an overall reading level of 6th grade. So I pressed onwards to the second book of the trilogy.<br /><br />It only got worse. The plot goes to the pits very quickly and the whole thing devolves into a repetitive love triangle/teen angst exercise. Painful, tedious and near the end of the second book, the whole narrative unravels and just loses all sense of cohesion. The level of suspension of disbelief goes through the roof. Similar problems with the last book persist in this book (spelling, grammar, etc.)<br /><br />The last book is just as poor, nonsensical and boring.<br /><br />You want pros? Okay: the books themselves all well bound, have easy to read fonts and have nice dust jackets. That is all.<br /><br />The movie ended up being a step above (or maybe a mile) these books. Do yourself a favor and skip these books unless you are a hard core fan and just want some shiny books with no real concern about what is inside.
0345803485|2.0|So, bear in mind I did not read this entire book. I got about 200 pages in and realized (about the point when this absolutely perfect billionare man wants to buy Ana a new car) that this book was just not for me. I'm assuming this book is meant for those who also read the Twilight books. I feel extremely let down, as much as I've heard about this series I really wanted more, and expected something new and exciting. Instead, it was mediocre at best. The story is just not relatable at all. I mean, come on, a 21 year old innocent virgin (who by the way is absolutely gorgeous and of course doesn't realize it) just runs into this beautifully stunning, rich god. It's absurd. It's a teenage fantasy that girls get sucked into thinking it could happen because there are books and movies that tell them so. The sex is not outrageous like I had hoped and the main character complains too much.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|This movie was awesome! I like the movie better than the book....maybe because I seen the movie first and then read the book, but yeah!

0525478817|3.0|You're joking, right? \\"Looking for Alaska\\" was my all time favorite book. Nothing could compare. So when I saw this book, I assumed it'd be good. Same author, it's about cancer. Somewhat like the movie/book \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". I was in. Although Green knows how to make a reader laugh, I was quite disappointed. It seemed more like a first novel, before the masterpiece of \\"Looking for Alaska\\". It was much different, and I wouldn't pick it up again.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game soo much!!!!!! this is the best game ever!! i used to ask my friend to use her iphone so i could use it and now i dont have to!!!!

B008458O3S|5.0|I have had several hours of fun with this game. Then when I finally completed all the levels there were additional bonus levels.  Hard game but not so hard that it disgusted me. After a little while I figured out the track layout and completed the challenge. I definitley recommend this game and would buy additional challenges if they were available.
0547569653|4.0|Being an average runner, I was still intrigued to read this new release from running icon Scott Jurek.  Anyone who eats a plant-based diet has to have interesting things to say, and he does.<br /><br />For me, the most enjoyable parts of the book are the times he writes about his close friend Dusty, and all the races they've been a part of over the years.<br /><br />The most intimate chapter of the book, LOST, recalls Jurek losing his Mother and also his marriage coming to an end.  He doesn't write too much about life after the marriage ending, but who can blame him?<br /><br />This isn't an earth shattering book, but a solid read with some good advice.. like, \\"All we have is now.\\"  So cherish each day.
B0086700CM|5.0|Got it first for iphone. I loved it. I would screw around and get caught by the monkeys. Have fun!!!!
B006OGMEUI|5.0|Seriously, if Klingons did folk metal, this is what it would sound like.<br /><br />Eluvetie are the pinnacle of this brand of music, and the only one that gets away with the Cookie Monster vocals.<br /><br />All of the band's icons are here, but it is held together with a story, where the main body of the music and songs are bracketted by  two English language monologs, explaining briefly the presumptive meaning of their lives. These underline a great sense of loss, which we should mourn...or not.<br /><br />In proper proportions, contemplation, melody, Klingon Rock-n-roll, and moments of rare beauty.<br /><br />Mostly, it rattles along at a good lick, and overall does not ease back. There is much to maintain one's interest.<br />Easily this band's best work.<br /><br />Hard to top. Masterpiece.

B002HL3PN4|4.0|We rented this through our amazon  Prime membership.  I was torn about paying the extra buck for HD. I am not sure it was worth it because I don't think the original was in hd.  Amazon offers old old movies in hd for an extra fee, which I find annoying because they are going to be fuzzy no matter what.  I feel the same way here, although I wish I could know ahead of time the difference before I shell out the extra cash.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|In all honesty, I appreciate the efforts of Gary Ross and co. He did what he could with what is really difficult source material, and in some form he managed to really pull it off. The film has great graphics and such, and right off the bat it already feels more intimate than your typical blockbuster thanks to some very low-key mood setting and handheld camera.<br /><br />But judging by the way the story is presented, this ultimately felt more like a fan movie than an official presentation. I mean yes there are flashes of brilliance throughout- one in particular being the Countdown scene. A moment of quiet brilliance. The embrace between Cinna and Katniss, the elevator to the arena, etc. Then the sudden blast into brutal violence. I will also admit found Haymitch to be hilarious too, great acting from Woody Harrelson. I knew when I read the book that he had to be played by Woody, and I got what I hoped.<br /><br />One more positive comment: Jennifer Lawrence was amazing, she was not an Oscar nominee for nothing people. She really helped lift the movie off the ground. She IS Katniss and she managed to keep the movie running, though weak and sloppy it may be.<br /><br />Now for the bad parts. Warning there's tons of spoilers.<br /><br />First, if I had to narrow down what I loved about the book to one thing was its intensity. Sure the book wasn't particularly amazingly written but Susanne knew how to keep a rising line of tension throughout the book. She kept the action constant, the violence brutal and she saved the romance for when appropriate. The movie has almost zero suspense in the action scenes. I get that the filmmakers wanted to go for that \\"silent action\\" thing, and problem is for this movie it doesn't work. It worked for Haywire, it worked for Edge of Darkness, it worked for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but for a movie about a bunch of kids forced to kill each other.<br /><br />The next big problem was there was not very much development. Sure Katniss is well developed but thats only because she is the protagonist. We don't get a sense that the kids in the other districts are connected, etc. Peeta's backstory is COMPLETELY CUT OUT. Primrose comes and goes. Effie Trinket gets a small amount of development in the sense that she as been around since the reaping began but that's it.<br /><br />Oh, and the adaptation discontinuity. Cutting out various big parts (Madge Undersee, AVOX,  etc) while emphasizing on smaller parts (Rue's death goes on for an atrociously long 10 minutes. They know each other for like 2 minutes then suddenly they are trying to get her out from the net, then she gets speared and Katniss cries for 10 minutes) and adding in parts that AREN'T IN THE BOOK (When Cato and the careers see smoke they leave a kid behind, and Foxface steals food without anyone knowing. So then Katniss tries stealing supplies and blows them up. And she doesnt go deaf or lose an ear.<br /><br />I guess it's a good standalone movie and those who haven't read the book will like it. I'll admit it deserves credit there, but in the end it felt like a big long trailer for a better movie. I'd say skip it and read the book. Or wait for the 6 hour director's cut.developed but thats only because she is the protagonist.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought that this book was awful.  What garbage that goes under the title \\"novel\\".  I will stick to biographies from now on.  Real life is cleaner than this \\"novel\\".
0345803485|1.0|All I am going to say is read the other 1-star reviews. They pretty much cover it. No sense in being any more redundant than the book is.<br /><br />On a personal note, I really mean no offense to the author. I give credit to anyone that takes the time and leap of faith to write a book and actually get it published. But in this case, I think we simply have a book that somehow sparked a word-of-mouth frenzy about its \\"taboo\\" subject material. Media hype fueled the fire and now it's a best seller. The fact is a best seller just means that it SELLS, not that it's good.
0785152458|5.0|I will be brief and just go on and say that this is a perfect sequel to Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass 2 is much darker than I would have expected, nothing like the first one. An instant buy for every comic fan out there looking for something exhilerating.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read all three books in this series. I would recommend this to any adult who is ready to spice up their life. I would also recommend reading this as a couple might make your love life exciting.
B0086700CM|5.0|Hooray I cant believe they finally made a version for the kindle fire although I wish they would fix the bit if lag that's there.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well written, character driven. After reading Fifty Shades of Grey (Book One) you will be chomping at the bits to get to book two and three to see what happens next to Ana and Christian. Be forewarned However, if extremely graphic sexual text and suggestive language bothers you or prevents you from seeing the entire goal of the book then DO NOT READ. But if you are open to the characters, plot, and developed written word READ and ENJOY.

B004I8WD6E|3.0|Case looks slick and fits well, screen protector is bubble-free. There are a few big problems though.<br /><br />- It's difficult to access the volume controls because the lip sticks out so much<br />- If you have some decent headphones you'll need to apply a lot of pressure to get the jack to fit into the small opening in the case<br />- Photos taken with the back facing camera appear washed out, especially when taken with flash<br /><br />For $10 it's not too bad, but you can do much better.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown IS a REAL HERO. Not a overpaid premadonna sports star that people idolize for no reason.  This man lived in the basement of hell...fought his way past his own demons...only to come out and fight the legions of demons waiting to attack our free land. He didnt need a cape, a hand or all of his vision to be superman....just a iron will and love in his heart. This isn't a typical (OVER DONE)book that quotes scores of others about BUD/S training. No teen age maturity level chest beating here...This book is about drive, resilience, pain, love and overcoming physical boundary's. Religion is mentioned (because it became a part of Adam Brown) however it IS NOT jammed down your throat with the butt stock of a rifle, like so many others love to do. Even the Brown family has balls enough to tell the TRUE past....not a spit shined version of a born golden child.  It is a great read & obviously I find it moving.<br />Be FEARLESS... check it out and remember.....freedom isn't free.

Great to se this fabulous movie that you can view time after time. Highly recommended.

B006X8GFBQ|4.0|This is a clear departure from Reynolds' earlier works, most of which I'd describe as masterful, fast paced, intelligent space operas, often with post-human elements and a punk noir flavour. Great escapist reads.<br /><br />Blue Remembered Earth is slower, more character driven, more contemplative... possibly more 'literary' in flavour (particularly the opening). I was a little put off at first an prepared to 'not like' an Alastair Reynolds book for the first time. I even put it aside, read another book and came back to it. But I'm glad I did come back to it. It's a much more near-term, 'closer to home' story but ultimately the characters are more complex and the concepts are fascinating. And the pace does accelerate.<br /><br />If you're a little patient, Blue Remembered Earth will reward you with a fun but also thought-provoking story, but if you're a huge Reynolds fan then you might want to pretend to yourself that it's a different author.

B005JABU82|4.0|This is the best Real Grade Kit I have built yet (It is my third)! The RX-78 kit suffered from loose fitting pieces that required glue and even some points of articulation (hips and shoulders) that you can't glue with out compromising articulation, but often came apart when trying to pose. The Freedom Gundam Real Grade model does not have these drawbacks. The only real drawback (if it is really a drawback) is that it is a little more complicated that some of the earlier Real Grade models and really would be for older kids if you are buying it as a gift for children (the box says 15 and up, which is probably pretty accurate).<br /><br />For less than 35 dollars, this was an amazing buy. I don't like to paint these kits because of the extremely small pieces, so getting the corresponding colors of the Real Touch markers is a good idea to cover any accidental white scars from cutting the sprues from the runners.

B006ZZANG0|5.0|This is possibly my favorite Rufus cd.  I have played it multiple times since receiving it.  The music is layered and complex and with Mark Ronson's touch, is transformative.  Above all the music, though, is that wonderful voice.  It never disappoints and it always moves.  I'm certain that life's experiences are stacking up to produce one of the finest artists in our lifetime.  Yes, I'm certain his mother's death has impacted his life in many ways.  But it's the musical gifts Kate (and even, I guess his father, Louden) has given him.  He (and his sister, Martha) have taken this legacy and soared.  Every song is a treasure and stands on it's own.  No missteps as far as I'm concerned.  I'm just a Rufus groupie, and at the age of (almost) 62, that probably says something about his wide appeal.  I love me some Rufus!  Keep it coming.
1451627289|5.0|Library Director's Notebook<br /><br />June, 2012<br /><br /> I remember where I was on November 22, 1963.  I was sitting in my 7th grade English class, watching with astonishment, as my usually dour teacher burst into tears upon learning that President Kennedy had been shot.<br /><br />At that time I had no understanding at all of what was happening in the United States regarding race relations, women's rights, the Cold War, or the American political scene.  The period of the late `50's and early 60's in American history is often glossed over in high school history classes, so I often feel a gap in my understanding of that tumultuous era.<br /><br />Reading Stephen King's novel 11/22/63, I feel I've been given a kind of mini-history class in the political and societal issues of that time.  King spent literally years doing research on this era.  The results of his meticulous investigations are felt on every page of his novel, making the reader feel deeply immersed not only in the characters but in their mid-20th century world.<br /><br />11/22/63 is both a genre novel and a stirring metaphysical examination of the flow,reset, and repeat of time.  It is a genre novel because it falls into the category of novels of the \\"what if\\" kind.  For example, what if someone had shot Hitler before 1936?  What if Lincoln had only been wounded, not assassinated?  And what if Lee Harvey Oswald never got a chance to fire at Kennedy?<br /><br />The story begins when an English teacher named Jake Epping reads a remarkable essay from one of his G.E.D. students.  His student's heartbreaking true story makes Jake realize how unpredictable everyone's life is, and what small details weave the fabric of our fates. The novel continues as Jake recounts the fateful moment when his friend Al lets him in on a secret.  Al's diner has a portal to the future.  Stepping through the portal takes a person back to 1958, with a chance to reset the future.<br /><br />Jake and Al decide to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Jake also hopes to change the event that had such a traumatic consequence for his G.E. D. student. Yet very shortly after entering the past, Jake realizes how delicate the balance is between making things right and making things worse.<br /><br />For one thing, Jake meets and falls in love with Sadie, a lovely woman with a troubled past.  How much can Jake tell Sadie about his mission?  Does he dare tell her that he is from the future, or that he plans to prevent an assassination of a president who hadn't even been elected in 1958?  As he falls more deeply in love with Sadie, Jake is torn between wanting to stay safely with her in her world, and his need to complete his quest to save President Kennedy, perhaps ensuring that the U.S. will not get embroiled in Viet Nam if Kennedy lives.<br /><br />Through the novel the twisted, secretive, disturbing life of Lee Harvey Oswald is brought into unrelenting focus.  Knowing of Oswald's history, Jake is able to shadow him periodically up to the fatal November date in 1963. As Jake studies Oswald he feels disgust yet also, in the end, a kind of reluctant pity. Yet neither disgust nor pity will drive Jake towards his final actions.<br /><br />Though we know how \\"it all ends\\", 11/22/63 has its share of astonishing developments right up to the novel's end.  This is Stephen King at his best, which is very good indeed!

0670921076|5.0|This is a really interesting and evocative true crime novel, set in Peking as it is poised on the brink of WWII. On a bleak January morning in 1937, the body of a young girl is found at the bottom of Fox Tower, a looming watchtower rumoured to be haunted by spirits. The girl is nineteen year old Pamela Werner and the motive is not robbery, as her expensive watch has stopped near midnight. The murder shocks the foreign inhabitants of Peking, who are already nervous about the possibility of invasion by Japanese troops and who huddle in the Legation Quarter trying to carry on life as normal. It shocks them still more when they discover the way Pamela's body has been mutilated.<br /><br />The book contains detail of the hunt for Pamela's killer, her life as the adopted daughter of a scholar, motives for her murder and a final, thrilling and horrifying conclusion of what happened to her that fateful night. Along the way we meet the inhabitants of the teeming Badlands area, various cover ups and an innocent young girl who becomes the victim of rumour - viewed either as a troubled schoolgirl, or a rather fast young lady who had too many suitors. Her father is also the victim of those who dislike his inability to fit in with the ex pat community; who distrust his lack of sociability and his embracing of Chinese culture. This is a fascinating account of Peking before the war, of a forign community who were unwilling to accept any of them could be guilty of such a terrible crime and of the innocent Pamela herself who highlighted the community's insecurities.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I was very engaged in the book until about the last quarter, at which point the story, in my opinion, became too weird. I felt the ending was a big let down. I do not recommend this book for the earlier Kindles. The images, which make up a large portion of the story, are near impossible to see. I had to load this on my Android phone and zoom into the images to view and enjoy them at all.

0345803507|1.0|After feeling like the only person on the planet who wasn't gushing about these books, I finally bought the trilogy.  I mean, after watching the Saturday Night Live skit spoofing 50 Shades and Mothers Day, how are you not tempted?  Not to mention that I had friends who swore up and down that their own sex lives had heated up after reading these books since it left them so hot and bothered.  So...where do I sign?  I got the books and read them.  I kept reading...and reading...and waiting for something - SOMETHING - in the book to spark.<br /><br />Instead, I found myself increasingly irritated by the characters.  And more so by the author, who apparently didn't see a problem with Christian and Ana `gasping' at each other at the end of every exchange.  `He ran his fingers through my hair and I gasped.'  `I smiled at him and he gasped.'  `He smirked at me and I gasped.'  Really?  REALLY???<br /><br />Look.  I'm not as bent out-of-shape as some of the other reviewers about the weak plot line.  I wholeheartedly agree that the plot lines were flimsy and the `character development' was paint-by-numbers...but truthfully, I wasn't expecting much, so maybe my expectations were a little more realistic.  But for those of you old enough to remember Nancy Friday books, you don't need a strong story line to get wrapped up in some guilty pleasure reading.  That's really all I wanted...some light, smutty reading that I could take out to the pool by day (and bring some of the friskiness into the bedroom by night).<br /><br />Instead, all of the heat fizzled due to the borderline criminal repetition of words and phrases that basically turned exchanges between Christian and Ana into a joke.  There are some really good elements here and I think that if executed properly, it would have been fantastic.  However, I agree with many of the other viewers that the overuse of the same words/phrases was so distracting, you were too mad to get turned on.
B000005RQT|5.0|Bone crushing distortion.  Eardrum shattering feedback.  This 1970 release has it all and then some.  I have to admit that this record was a bit more than I could handle.  In fact, I made the mistake of listening to it at a loud volume in the car on the way to work and my ears were ringing for hours afterwards.  That and I drove 80 miles an hour the whole way.<br /><br />Although In Rock is pretty wild, the 1971 follow-up album Fireball was a bit quieter and more experimental/progressive, not to mention the classic Machine Head from 1972 (this is a defining Deep Purple album in my mind).  The approach on In Rock is interesting however (in an MC-5 sense of the word), and the album pretty much blows every hard rock/heavy metal album I have listened to out of the water based on energy levels alone.<br /><br />Heavy riffs, a bulldozer-like rhythm section, lead singer Ian Gillan making wild-man Arthur Brown sound like a member of the Vienna Boys Choir, Jon Lord ramming his over-driven (and furious) Hammond organ through a fuzz box; all with Ritchie Blackmore playing his electric guitar at a crushing volume and frying amplifiers set at \\"11\\".  This pretty much sums up the overall sound on In Rock.  There are, however, a few quieter moments on the album, provided by Jon Lords \\"churchy\\" sounding Hammond organ (Child in Time comes to mind).  These moments are merely the eye of the storm, however and are short-lived.<br /><br />This remastered album is very nice and the CD booklet features a ton of liner notes and band photos.  There are extra tracks (a few singles) and some remixed tracks.  The sound quality, although remastered, is just OK.  The overall sound seems a bit muffled/muddy, and the separation of individual instruments is not clear.<br /><br />All in all, this album generates enough raw electrical energy to power a large city for the foreseeable future.  The frightening intensity of this music still sounds fresh today - I think that the heavy metal style may well be \\"timeless\\".  Although this album was a little too loud for my taste, the energy and passion are undeniable.  The albums Fireball (1971) and Machine Head (1972) are not as wild, with Machine Head presenting an excellent example of the Deep Purple sound.  The landmark live album Made in Japan (1972) is also highly recommended.be \\"timeless\\".  Although this album was a little too loud for my taste, the energy and passion are undeniable.

B00821OW8K|5.0|I watched the entire season over four days and I loved the series. I'm disappointed that the network decided to release the season on DVD so close to the premiere of the second season. I would have preferred to buy the DVD, but I ordered it on amazon.com instead. Love you Amazon Instant View.<br /><br />At first I could not stand Noah Whyle' character because of the way he ratchets up his voice. His voice is very, very, very annoying. I hope we don't here that in the second season. Also, I don't need a freakin history lesson before every decision or battle is fought. I loved the female characters, especially the doctor and the blonde haired lady who joined the season around epi one or two. The one who shot the two guys guys in the renegade grop. I also liked the middle son of Noah Whyle, sorry I can't recall the characters name played by Whyle.<br /><br />Overall, the show is terrific. I can't wait until Sunday, 15

0439813786|5.0|I remember read \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" two years ago in May and I found it to be one of the best books I've ever read. It's a truly amazing story that combines words and pictures to help tell its story. Before I even read Selznick's other companion masterpiece \\"Wonderstruck\\", I thought Hugo Cabret's formula between a picture book and a novel was magnificent. And so what with it now already created into a motion picture by Martin Scorsese, I decided to read it again and relive Hugo Cabret's journey all over again.<br /><br />We are taken to Paris, France in the year 1931, and in the first pages in illustrations, we meet the young orphan Hugo Cabret in a busy train station and when he slips into the walls of the station and through a clock, he sees an old man who runs a toy booth. When Hugo goes to the toy booth, he has a scuffle with the old man and is accused of stealing a notebook filled with drawings Hugo claims that it belongs to him. Running away with empty hands, Hugo checks all of the clocks around the station to see if they're in working condition, and we learn that he lives in the station up in an attic room. Later, he meets the old man again and wants to get the notebook back, but then follows the man to his home and sees a young girl his age in the man's house. But with no luck, Hugo returns to the train station, and we read a moment from his past about him and his father who was a clockmaker and how they were trying to finish an automaton they were building, which Hugo still has now. Sadly, his father was killed in an unexpected fire and Hugo had to live with his unpleasant Uncle Claude, who led a dirty life. But one day when his uncle goes off for something and has not returned, Hugo then has started to live by himself in the train station ever since, and vows to finish building the automaton.<br /><br />After that, Hugo makes a deal with the old man to work with him at the toy booth in order to get the notebook back. While doing so, he meets a young man with an eye patch on his face named Etienne, who is a friend of the young girl who Hugo now knows as Isabelle. They all decide to see a movie with together, and Hugo becomes curious of Isabelle's necklace with resembles a heart-shaped key and believes it may have something to do with the automaton. Without a choice, he takes her necklace and runs up to his home and sure enough, it fits on the automaton. Suddenly, it starts to function and starts drawing an unusual picture of the moon, and it may leave a clue to Hugo's future.<br /><br />\\"Hugo Cabret\\" is one book that will definitely leave readers astonished to the last page.  Everything in the book is perfect: the story, the characters and the illustrations. No wonder it won the Caldecott Medal. Both kids and adults will no doubt have an incredibly enchanted adventure with \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\".<br /><br />(Grade: A)oung man with an eye patch on his face named Etienne, who is a friend of the young girl who Hugo now knows as Isabelle.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|Oh wow. How awful. Portia de Rossi's story is so eye-opening and honest. It made me feel less alone and slightly neurotic. Now, I don't have anorexia, but I do have a serious love/hate relationship with food. It's been a battle for years, and I'm currently \\"dieting.\\" Hearing her story right when I probably needed it the most has been enlightening.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie, I was hoping for more about her and Ellen. I don't read book descriptions so I had NO clue that this book was about her battle with eating disorders. But all wasn't lost - not in the least. I was so engrossed with her life story, taking in all I could about how rationally she talked about her mindset, that I hardly remembered the Ellen part of her life. Her thoughts were more than preposterous, but she talks about it all like she's the sane one. It's incredible what these diseases do to a person, physically and mentally.<br /><br />Trying to convince herself that she wasn't gay, Portia de Rossi created a diversion and focused on her body. 115 pounds was her goal weight at 5'7\\", but, being a newly famous actress, that turned out not to be good enough. Bottoming out at 82 pounds (!!!!), de Rossi finally reached her breaking point when her body wouldn't comply with her mind's wishes. It's astounding that she managed to eat so little and do so much!!<br /><br />I basically loved listening to her story, heartbreaking as it is. She narrates this herself, so everything is spoken just as she means it. Our culture these days doesn't seem to make a big deal about eating disorders anymore, but it's serious business. de Rossi is so brave for sharing her story in hopes to help anyone who struggles with the daily ins and outs of eating and maintaining good health at the same time. As someone who deals with this every day, I so appreciate this story. It makes me feel brave to just enjoy being who I am, knowing that I'm not alone, and to make peace with the fact that health will come with a good balance in my life. THANK YOU.my life. THANK YOU.

0547569653|5.0|I'm a little biased but also very proud of Scott for finally producing this book. As a co-founder and Trustee of the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run for 32 years, I became friends with Scott during his years racing it.<br />I had a front row view during his seven-year reign as champion, an era that proved to be my favorite. Sometimes it seemed his feet were barely touching the ground as he ran the rugged trails, other times I watched him dig deep into the warrior spirit that carried him through the tough patches.<br /><br />We could always count on a thrill when Scott and Dusty were first to arrive at the 78-mile Rucka Chucky River Crossing. Under the afternoon's oppressive blazing hot sun they would dunk themselves in the refreshing chest high and fast moving water; you could almost hear them sizzle. Aided by the stalwart River Team, Scott and Dusty grabbed the safety line so not to be washed downstream and pulled themselves hand over hand across huge uneven and slippery riverbed boulders to the other side. Onlookers watched in awe and knew they were witnessing something special, those were some amazing times. Scott always showed true sportsmanship and gratefulness to people around him.<br /><br />Many of the fun times with Scott were spent in the kitchen as we created dazzling, healthy and tasty dishes. Some of his vegan culinary expertise rubbed off on me, which I still incorporate today.<br /><br />Of course I followed many of his other races as well as he has accomplished so much and inspired me often.  Scott Jurek is an awesome human being and this book will share his greatness with many readers.<br /><br />Taylor adds: Hey man! You forgot to include the the time when I rescued you and Dusty at Robinson Flat. Remember when your car got stuck and I had to drive up and pull you two knuckleheads out of the SNOW?

0525478817|4.0|This is the second book I've read by John Green. The first was Looking for Alaska, which is one of my true favourites. I've never been one to read much YA literature, even when I was a young adult. For some reason the books on the YA Lit shelf never rung true with me. But John Green gets it. He writes for people, not just young adults. His characters just happen to be in that age range.<br /><br />That said, this book was phenomenal. I read it in one sitting, something I've only done twice in my life (this being the second time.) I laughed, I cried, but mostly I just cried. While this book is ridiculously sad, it's also full of inspiration and hope. Very bittersweet. The characters were sympathetic and well-rounded, and the situation was real. Being someone who has taken care of a dying person, I never once felt like the author was trying to gloss over certain aspects. It's all here.<br /><br />If you read this, have a box of tissues handy. The tears are completely worth it.

0440243688|2.0|After reading \\"Nothing To Lose,\\" I felt that Lee Child would do MUCH better.  Sadly, he only did a little better.  I was so disappointed with \\"Nothing To Lose\\" that I skipped this book and am only now reading it.  Fortunately, things got better after these two books, yet I really struggled to be intrigued.  Typically, I begin reading and live it...... not with this book.  I 'endured it' but it had no kick for me.<br />Keep the faith, Reacher lovers......... it gets a bit better after this book.

B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|This film unfairly cast some allure due to the expansive supporting cast and director. While it was entertaining, in a sense, to see so many favorite actors age; that wasn't the reason I purchased the film. I purchased the film expecting to enjoy a B+ movie with some satisfying direction and a good supporting cast rooting around in a film written by Lem Dobbs who actually hasn't written anything worthwhile since the \\"Score\\" 10 years ago (hence the B+). I also lulled myself into thinking that Steven Soderbergh may have had some real influence in the film besides subsequently whiling away his time boring me with 5 minutes of Gina Carano running around in the film. Yes she can run. Yes, she can beat up guys. But can she act? Poorly directed, poorly written and the poorest acting by the \\"star\\"; I can only recommend this film to...no one! I spent my evening apologizing to my girlfriend and hey!?... is Steven Soderbergh dating Gina Carano?
B0064X79JC|3.0|After watching Drive on Netflix, I wanted to read the novel.  The movie was truly great and I was hoping the novel was also.  However, I was a little disspointed.  The novel isn't bad, it just doesn't live up to the movie.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the non-linear plotline and the way it unfolds and I thought that part of the novel was put together very well.<br /><br />If you like gritty, crime novels and a touch of stylistic writing, you'll probably really enjoy this.  Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.
0143120530|1.0|The only thing that Joshua Foer does an excellent job at is showing off his wealth of vocabulary, but does little for offering any art or science of memorizing. In fact, readers can expect to find the only memorization techniques printed in this book to fit neatly onto less than one page. Foer uses the other 270 pages to attempt to prove that he is smart and cunning. I dedicated myself to reading his book in its entirety in order to learn the \\"art and science\\"  of memorization and am furious to have been forced into patiently being exposed to Foer's boring story-tellings. The book was not totally a waste. I learned about the other authors who have written books that actually do teach the art and science of memorization. Joshua Foer is annoying in his stlye of writing and the book goes more into a history of his and others' dealings with memory. His TED talk, title of book and descrption of the book make it seem like we will learn how to become better memorizers. Well, you will need to go elsewhere for that to happen. Never again will I read another book by this hipster. I came away from it feeling furious and cheated. Mercifully, I checked it out from the library and did not waste my money on it.

0880291044|5.0|Indeed, Marcus Aurelius clearly stands as one of the greatest Spiritual Giants to visit our earth. I picked up 1966 translation by Maxwell Staniforth because it was compact enough to fit in my inside jacket pocket. The introduction was more clear and descriptive of Stoicism, than the entire class I took at university. I've even heard from a psychiatrist that Marcus was a \\"grandiose manic\\". I have read 'Meditations' many times, but this time was special. Staniforth even links tenants of Stoics to Early Christianity.<br />  Marcus writes \\"To Himself\\";  \\"Accept without resentment whatever may befall.\\"  Marcus was on the front, with the Roman Army trying to stop the incursion of tribes of barbarians, in the Roman Empire, there were plagues, floods, famines, plots, Christians, --overwhelming demands. And I get perturbed because there's no cream for morning coffee! But he continues to say that life events are 'neither good nor bad', but describes them as 'indifferent'. I personally would be delighted to see events this way! Impartial, Objective, with equanimity.<br />  Staniforth's translation of \\"Meditations\\" (\\"To Himself\\") was a Royal treatment of the words of a Cosmic Messenger. Thank you!!

The beautiful tulle skirt with black floral detailing, fitted black shouldwrap top and tulle wrap create the effortless beauty Kelly so easily emulated on screen.  Her golden locks are brushed back into a sophisticated style, and her pose is one of commanding feminine authority.  Easy to see how LB Jefferies could not resist her, no matter how hard he tried!<br /><br />The face sculpting does not seem to be a precise as the To Catch a Thief doll, but it is still less Barbie and more Grace.<br /><br />The box is disappointing.  Part of collectible dolls is their showcase boxes, so this lackluster box is something to be desired.  Compared to the extravagant The Birds box, and even the less so To Catch a Thief box, I was hoping for more, but at least the doll delivers.  Any Grace Kelly or Alfred Hitchcock fan should add this doll to their collection.

0345803507|3.0|After reading through the first two books like I had a match under my you know what I must say I found it difficult to finish this book. I did because I hate to leave things unfinished but it was not an enjoyable experience. The every two page sex scenes are now old and you find yourself desiring something more thought provoking. The author is in dire need of a thesaurus and I felt like if I read the phrase \\" Oh my\\", \\" I blush\\" or anything with the word \\"hot\\" in it I was going to find her and tape one to her forehead. Also the quick fix story lines are discouraging, if you can't hold suspense for more than one chapter before solving the problem this is an issue.*Spoiler alert* The happily ever after ending was predictable with the two kids and picket fence with the same for her BFF. Lets face it, the sex made the story interesting and once that fades all your left with is???? You tell me.
B0058RN85O|5.0|Modern Family is one of one must see sitcoms on television today. The cast is great, the writing is sharp, and the characters are unforgettable.  With no laugh track and quick, sharp jokes, you must pay attention. Buying the discs is great because I always pick up something new with each viewing and rewinding to hear lines I laughed through is easy. It's one of the smarter sitcoms in recent memory.  There's not a weak character and no tedious ongoing storyline that drags the show down. Overall great comedy. My personal opinion: Manny's the best.

B0073XORCY|5.0|whilst a huge Tull fan, I purchased this with some trepidation. you know, sequels and all. well, the fear had no basis. This is superb. As good as the first? Probably not. But the feel is similar, the music complex but accessible and some confronting and humorous lyrics. I was transported back to the 70s. Has been on high rotation since it arrived. The DVD mix is worth the effort as well. Very enjoyable!

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was amazing from start to finish!  I can honestly say, I'm not one to write a review of books but I've been compelled to do so after reading this book in two days!  Jamie McGuire has a new fan and look forward to reading all that she publishes.  The characters of Abby Abernathy, Travis Maddox, America, and Shepley were very well developed, very little questions were left in understanding the characters and the role they played in the story!  For me, this addictive and always captivating story drew me in from the first paragraph!  The reminders that love is not perfect and in the end the lesson of falling in love despite the odds had me laughing, and crying all at the same time.  I would recommend this book to anyone whose looking for a real page turner, but be prepared for an emotional roller coaster...so hang on to your seats and allow yourself to sink your teeth into the most excruciating love story ever written!  No doubt, this story will send Jamie McGuire to the top of the NY Times Bestsellers list in no time!

0062183591|5.0|This book is eye-opening, fascinating and somewhat depressing at the same time. It is an inside look at why ordinary people--not criminals--cheat, deceive and otherwise act selfishly at the expense of others.<br /><br />What's interesting is that many acts of dishonesty are not blatant, but rather are small mental decisions, often made without the intent to maximize profits. As Ariely explains, people only cheat up to the point that they can rationalize their actions to themselves. The actions are often seemingly small, but they can have a big impact.<br /><br />The book walks readers through a variety of experiments that were designed to identify what conditions and what incentives would cause a person to be dishonest, and to what extent a person would be dishonest. Overlaid with Ariely's narrative and explanations, this is a book that you will find hard to put down.<br /><br />As for those of you who have read Predictably Irrational, I think you will find this book to be a worthy addition to your library. It follows a similar style to Predictably Irrational, but covers new material.<br /><br />-Charles Rotblut<br />Author, Better Good Than Lucky

030758836X|4.0|I love Gillian Flynn. I just found out about her reading the buzz for this book and went out and got Sharp Objects and Dark Places and read them both over Memorial Day Weekend. Best Books Ever. I was on the edge of my sofa cushion the whole time. So I was very anxious for this new book. I got it early from my library on Saturday and read it in one day.<br />I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong it was a great book, but it didn't have that shocking twist that the other two books had. It was a long slow burn, and not as intense as the other two. If you read this book and haven't read Sharp Objects go back and read it.<br />Flynn has a real flair for evil women and that is what I loved about the other two books. The women were evil and the emotions behind their actions were very believable. In Gone Girl there was evil, but I didn't believe it as much. Female  psychopaths are rare, sociopaths, maybe, but not psychopaths.<br />It was still over all an interesting read. The ending was a little disappointing, no, to be truthful, I was very disappointed, but I don't want to give anything away. It was a frustrating, no resolution ending and I like everything tied up in a nice neat bow. That did not happen here.
1466401885|5.0|So look, this is a BOOK. a book is suppose to take you somewhere else and make you feel something. It is not something that we are going to take life lessons from. I mean, come on, do you really think us teens are THAT dense? Well we aren't. I loved this book because it was so beautifully heartbreaking. I could have done without the sex details, but eh, thats what the author wanted. But when you finished this book, didn't you FEEL the heart break and happiness it wanted you to feel? Yes. At least I did. So thank you for writing such an addictive, perfect story for me to read!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I accidentally bought Wool for the Kindle after mis-clicking the buy button. I wasn't interested in it at all - the title of the book doesn't seem too interesting. Too lazy to get a refund, I figured why not read it?<br /><br />Wool 1 completely blew me away. Not only is the plot some of the best I've read, but the writing is superb. Wool 1 is one of the best science fiction stories I've ever read. Wool takes place in a mysterious underground silo that houses thousands of people. The characters are normal people living in this silo. Some have doubts about their existence and research more into their everyday lives. There are many secrets, and only little bits are revealed at a time. Wool 1 finishes with a bang yet leaves the reader wanting more. Hugh Howey gives you more.<br /><br />Each successive Wool reveals more and more secrets, until the reader knows everything by Wool 5. If you think Wool 1 was good, keep reading. The next books will keep on delivering.<br /><br />The Kindle editing is flawless. I didn't encounter any errors.<br /><br />My only criticism is to make a better book cover. Something artsy. The current book covers don't interest me at all.<br /><br />Hugh Howey if you're reading this I would love to draw some covers for you, free of charge, because Wool is awesome.
B0068RHGJM|2.0|For me, what has always made progressive rock exciting is the difficulty of finding a balance between progressive elements (whatever those might be) and more popular rock. This is a delicate balance, and the ability to get there is what makes a great band. When the balance tips, a record can become a competition of who can play more notes or hit more toms in a given amount of time. Or, it can become a musical. I think the latter happened on this record, which is so overwhelmed with children choruses, symphonic instruments, and people screaming or talking instead of singing, that it becomes a soundtrack to a nonexistent (?) musical.<br />Disappointed :(
0553582038|4.0|Ok, I'm not really understanding all of the bad reviews on this book.  People seem to be having problems with the fact that only half of the characters from the previous books are included and that the POVs of some lesser characters are included.  Just because it is different doesn't make this book worse than the first three.  I think that the fact that we have to wait for the POVs of other characters like daenarys, stannis, and jon actually builds the suspense.  As I read the book, it makes me wonder what is happening with these other characters as the story is playing out.  As for the lesser characters having chapters, it is strange at first to read from the POV of \\"the kraken\\" or \\"the queenmaker\\", but once you get used to these new characters I don't think anything is detracted from this slightly new style of writing. Martin is basically just turning one very long book into two slightly shorter books than the first three.  This could be seen as a money grab, but I have no problem paying an extra ten bucks to Martin who has kept me thoroughly entertained with his writing.<br /><br />The only other problem people seem to have is that \\"nothing really happens\\".  I don't really agree with this statement.  The plot is slightly slower than the first three books, but c'mon; have you read any other books?  The plot in Feast for Crows is still about ten times quicker than 90% of the books I have read in my lifetime, and the writing is still just as good.  There is some good character and plot development as well as plenty of good old fashioned bloodshed.  The plot in these books had to slow down at some point, if it kept moving as fast as the first three books, there soon wouldn't be any main characters left.<br /><br />In closing, I encourage you to read this book despite poor reviews.  If you enjoy the writing style of the first three books and have a little patience, I think you will like this book too.  New locations like Braavos and Dorne are featured as well as new characters and storylines.  Keep an open mind and wait until you get through a few chapters before dismissing this slightly different book from the rest of the series.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|This movie is very artistic. It's music, it's visuals, even the story content. A must have. I'm sorry my 4 year old and I absolutely love it!! It doesn't get old. In fact, we're gonna watch it again tonight and I've had it for at least a year. It's a masterpiece!!
B003TQKVGU|1.0|I was lurred to read this book because I've been reading several books about the brain (\\"Think, Fast and Slow\\" and \\"Brain Rules\\" amongst others) and thought this title, combined with the $1.99 price tag (for kindle) and high rating reviews would make it a safe bet to add to my collection. But boy was I wrong (and boy should I have read those reviews first). Although the main take-aways of this book have some value (believe in yourself and others will too, put an idea in your mind and your subconscious mind will encourage you to act on it), there is too much processed bologny in the form of religious anecdotes, the idea that you can will anything to happen (i.e., believe enough that you will be a millionaire and magically you'll be a millionaire), and extravagant claims of success of countless individuals without one proper reference to back up the claims. This book is not even remotely credible and not worth reading in the least.

And I must admit this app I very intuitive!! I have never been any good at digital media until I got this app. And its woo much like a sketch book that I am able to draw normally! I only wish they had textured backgrounds so it would look more like a sketch book drawing rather than digital media...
0785132619|5.0|Have you ever wanted to be a superhero? I always wanted to and this novel expressed the cons of being a superhero. Being a superhero isn't all fun and games. Being a superhero is being able to let go of family and friends. It may be very violent but is very emotional (ie Hitgirl and Big Daddy). I liked how it was pretty realistic not every sper hero gets the girl. The graphics were insane. This story about a zero trying to become a hero is hilarious. Reccomended for 13+. This is a great comic to read before you watch the movie which is really good! The movie is also really good and I can't wait for Kick Ass 2 (both the graphic novel and movie)!
B005FISBTO|2.0|I just finished watching Season 6 and at the end of the day, I got to say I was pretty disappointed.  To give a little context, I can't say I'm a die hard Dexter fan, but I do very much like this series, mostly because I like the character Dexter with all his complexities and demons, Michael C Hall puts a very good spin on his Antihero.  But this season, the whole Doomsday murders were a bit of a turnoff, possibly cause the crazy religious convictions of a delusional mind are bit tired, possibly because it was portrayed in such a way that just didnt make them or its main antagonist played by Colin Hanks interesting.  I'm not sure what the writers were thinking, but if the idea was to turn everything left off from season 5 on its head, the execution was poorly implemented...now on to the specifics (if you haven't seen this Season specifically, detailed spoilers follow, however, you can skip over the spoilers to the conclusion section that is spoiler free)<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />First off, I maybe amongst the few that really liked Dexter and Lumen together.  That dynamic struck me in a way few series have been able to pull off, I felt he met his soul mate, more so than Rita since as close as they were, there was still a side to him she would NEVER understand, so it was obvious in season 5 just how strongly he felt about Lumen because she saw him for what he was - a serial killer - and she was cool with it.  But in season 6, I might have caught 1 single passing reference to her, that was it and maybe 1 regarding Rita, I cant remember for sure, but it almost seems like that slate has been permanently wiped from existence.  Also, aside from Harrison (his biological son), wheres the ongoing dynamic with Astor and Cody?  They were also no where to be found in this season with little to no context as to how or what they are presently doing.  Dexter reconciling his personal/ family life with his life as a serial killer is the cornerstone of the entire show,but this season, aside from Deb, they were MIA.  For example, imagine an entire season of sopranos, where its just Tony Soprano doing his gangster thing after Carmilla dies, Anthony and Meadow are gone to live at their grandparents and he doesn't make one passing reference to them the entire season...kind of boring since the entire show was predicated on the contrasting aspects of the two different lives he lives - family man, gangster family man...the same can be said of Dexter.<br /><br />...and Deb, WTF?  Did anybody else find it just a little bit weird shes all of a sudden figured out she's in love with him?  Even if they aren't biological brother and sister, it still struck me as completely weird because theres no redeeming qualities between them, they have ZERO screen chemistry, which probably makes sense why their real life marriage didn't work out.  IDK, but if the show continues in that direction, cause the cat is out of the bag at the end of the season, I'm not sure if I want to continue watching and just chalk it up to 5 great seasons, however I'm not as black and white as I sound, I'll at least give it my best shot...point being though, I just don't like the possibility of that pairing at all.<br /><br />Moving on, I have my complaints, but I don't want to make it sound like the season was a complete failure.  I personally thought a high note was Mos Def as Brother Sam.  Now there's a relationship that could have and should have been cultivated deeper, it would have added an interesting dynamic and possible conclusion since the longer Brother Sam was around, you could sense his influence - toward the light - growing, even though Dexter openly rejected it, it did give him pause in his internal dialog.  For once, Dexter had a real life person - rather than his dead dad - try to instill a different ideology where the Dad ultimately failed, to which the dad admits eventually.<br /><br />As for the main antagonists, the doomsday killers - Travis Marshall (Colin Hanks) and Professor Gellar (Edward James Olmos) - there really isn't much to say other than I particularly didn't like Hanks squirrely type of acting, I actually found him to be annoying.  But aside from that, any interesting or redeeming significance this duo was trying to accomplish or the lore to which inspired their actions were lost in a contrived \\"this dudes a nutjob\\" story line that you end up questioning your boredom tolerance after the second or third episode of the season.  The religious spin has been done before, it certainly has been done better, but unfortunately this aspect along with the flat, uninspired writing were the seasons biggest failures IMO.<br /><br />The final thing I want to touch on is when is it going to be a successful day for Miami Metro Homicide?  There has been 6 seasons now where the Department has been nothing more than a complete dog and pony show since Dexter is the one who always gets to the bad guy first while the rest of the department gets to piss in the wind at the end of the day.  There have been tons of close calls over the years and different characters have had their suspicions about Dexter, but that seems to be about as far the show is willing to go.  Time to change that.  Hopefully the big reveal at the end really is as big as it should be...<br /><br />**CONCLUSION (no spoilers)**<br /><br />Dexter is a fun show to watch, with its interesting characters and tight writing with its twists and turns, but certainly isn't the last bastion of good television.  I hope for the sake of a show I've really come to enjoy over the last few years that it can be saved and theres still tons of room to make changes.  I certainly understand not every season can be its best, there are bumps in every road, however there always comes a time when you're fresh out of ideas and its time to hang up your hat and end it while you're still on top of your game (looking at you simpsons).  Unfortunately, season 6 would not be my best choice togo out on and it would have probably been the better decision to skip over the filler and jump right into what would be a conclusion arch.<br /><br />Honestly, I would recommend you skip watching the season and catch the important stuff in the recap, since 90% of season 6 is utterly devoid of anything you probably like about \\"Dexter\\".  Also pretty sure the recap will probably harp on the big reveal, which was the very last 5 seconds of episode 12.

159514188X|3.0|I struggled just trying to decide what I was going to rate this book. I settled on three because, while the things I didn't like about it outweigh what I did like, I still felt compelled to keep reading. And while, I didn't love the book or even like parts of it, I still think the tale it tells is an important one worth reading, thinking about and discussing. It helps that it really is page-turner and if I'm being honest, what I dislike may have more to do with my comfort level with the subject matter and not the book itself.<br /><br />High school student Clay returns home after a day of classes and finds a package addressed to him outside his door. Inside the box, he finds 14 cassette tapes, each side labeled with the numbers 1-13, the last side of the last tape is left unmarked. Curious as to the content of the tapes, he searches his home until he finds a player and is surprised to hear the voice of his one time crush, Hannah, who had recently committed suicide. Hannah explains that each side of the tapes tells the story of an individual that contributed to her decision to end her life. She instructs the listener (Clay, in this case, who is the \\"co-narrator of the book) to send the tapes to the person whose story comes after their own. She makes it clear that another copy exists and will be released if the person doesn't carry out her wish that all 13 people hear the tapes. Clay listens to the tapes while traveling around his town, in an attempt to view life as Hannah had. The rest of my review will contain some spoilers, so if you haven't read the book and don't want to know more, stop reading now.<br /><br />I've read many reviews of this book that claim it was silly for Hannah to commit suicide over something that seems so trivial. I greatly disagree with that. Not everyone thinks the same way in this world. When I was in high school, I was the victim of some particularly nasty rumors, similar to those Hannah faced. I found her easy to relate to in that respect. And this is why I think this book is important because it makes the reader think about how a rumor or something one thinks of as a joke can really impact the target, as Clay realized as he listens.<br /><br />I also like Hannah's section directed at Clay. He ponders over his relationship with Hannah and had many unanswered questions about her and how she had perceived him. He was the good guy in Hannah's life and I felt like he got some closure out of it.<br /><br />What I hated, and I do mean hated, about this was that Hannah made the tapes at all. She herself stated it began and ended with her, so I can't understand her choice to make her pain known not only to those she felt had caused it, but to every person on that list. The majority of them seemed to be typical teens, some-what careless about what their words can do. Maybe I'm naive, but I think that just the act of committing suicide would have caused most of the people in her story to consider what they'd said and done. And, with the incidents of the rape and the car accident, if Hannah was going to tell anyone those tales, it should have been to the police, not to 13 people she asked to remain silent on what they had heard. Her actions with the tapes were vindictive and revenge driven, plain and simple.<br /><br />That said, I realize there really isn't a way for this story to work without sending the tapes. And I think the book is real an eye opener for people. And the format is intriguing and creative.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|My wife and I had the pleasure of seeing the Chris Robinson Brotherhood several times last year, and those shows were among the most enjoyable we've seen in years.  Since we'd already heard many of the songs on this album at those live shows this album didn't come as a surprise, we'd already formed an attachment to those songs--though it's odd to hear songs live first and on an album later.  But they sound just as good on this recording as they did live, I suppose they got to fine tune the songs onstage long before they went into the recording studio.<br /><br />CR's abilities as a songwriter just get stronger and stronger as the years go by.  He's matured into a writer who can tackle rock or soul or roots/Americana as he pleases, with an ability to turn just the right lyrical phrase matched by strong melodies and finally crafted solo instrumentation.  Sometimes an album with songs that touch so many bases sounds unfocused, like they didn't know what they wanted to sound like.  But with CRB the effect is one of confidence and huge competence; this band isn't experimenting to find out what they're good at, they handle every style with ease.  This is an album that Black Crowes fans will enjoy, but so will folks into alt.country or jam-band psychedelia, Big Moon Ritual draws from so many musical sources that almost anyone will hear something they respond to.<br /><br />Big Moon Ritual is his best solo recording so far, and that's saying a lot considering how good New Earth Mud and This Magnificent Distance were.  So I'm torn--on the one hand I look forward to more from Chris Robinson Brotherhood, the music is just too good not to want more.  But I'm also desperately hoping the Black Crowes reform soon as I've loved their music for two decades.  Either way Chris Robinson will continue to deliver some of the best music being made today.

B00846REIS|5.0|This is a wonderfully written, erotically charged love story. Gideon and Eva are two very damaged, complex individuals who are immediately drawn to eachother. You are sucked into their love story not only bc of how passionate they are for one another, but because how real their characters are. Gideon comes onto Eva quite forcefully and she does not immediately give into his advances. I was glad for that bc it fit Eva's character perfectly. She was not putty in his hands just bc he was the most beautiful man she had ever seen. That was one of the things that bothered me about Fifty Shades of Grey even though I do love that series!<br />There are a lot of similarities between this book and Fifty Shades as other reviews have pointed out..Gideon and Christian are both 28, breathtakingly beautiful and own successful companies. They are also both quite damaged. Ana and Eva are quite different except they are both only children who just graduated college. Also the love scenes in Bared to You are extremely hot...even hotter than 50 and without the Red Room of Pain! I am all for being tied up, but I could have done without all the other kinky stuff in Fifty Shades.<br />This book is just about two people who have an immediate connection, fall in love, have extremely hot sex and have to figure out how to make their reationship work bc they are both so deeply damaged. This is what was so real to me about the love story..while not everyone goes through some type of abuse as these chacters did, we all have our own issues that make relationships difficult. The challenge is learning to get past these issues and hopefully becoming better people bc of your love for eachother.<br />One thing I found terribly unrealistic about this book is that Eva, Gideon and the rest of the characters in the book are supposed to be completely gorgeous. It was really my only complaint and not much of one at that!<br />I cant wait for the next book!
0385341008|1.0|This book was awful! I have read THOUSANDS of books and never written a review. This book is terrible. I am in total slack jawed awe over the thousands of positive reviews. The characters are not developed. The first few dozen pages are cryptic in an annoying way... not a mystery novel or got-you-hooked-page-turner way. WW2 is SUPPOSED to be used as the backdrop and reason for the title, but the disjointed writing could cause a historically inept person to believe WW2 was fabricated by the authors as a convenient cause for secret food gatherings. This book is assanine.
B003XRZZFM|3.0|A bunch of good songs and a bunch of not so good ones.  I hope the next release is alot better as this band is capable of far greater.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|So far so good. Seems like it will do the job. So far I have not figured out if I can get on the internet with this via my computer. That would be great. It does allow me to put stuff on my Fire from my computer which is what I wanted it for.
B007NESBK2|1.0|have thousands of cds and hundreds of concert dvds...<br /><br />this is by far the most boring concert dvd EVER. saw her a few years ago at the Bowl; wasn't impressed; bought this based on the reviews...<br /><br />my fave song; nothing can come between us is a one minute snippet of her band, not her... songs go no where; like listening to cds in the dark!<br /><br />what a waste!  would give it a \\"0\\" if an option!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|\\"Biography:<br />E L James is a TV executive, wife and mother of two, based in West London. Since early childhood, she dreamt of writing stories that readers would fall in love with, but put those dreams on hold to focus on her family and her career. She finally plucked up the courage to put pen to paper with her first novel, Fifty Shades of Grey.\\"<br /><br />Whoops, sorry, I think the biography has a mistake in it.  Lemme proofread that for you:<br /><br />\\"Biography:<br />E L James is a TV executive, wife and mother of two, based in West London. Since early childhood, she dreamt of writing stories that readers would fall in love with, but put those dreams on hold in order to write her first novel, Fifty Shades of Grey.\\"<br /><br />There, much better.<br /><br />Bad writing, lame characters, basically a Twilight photocopy with more clumsy, silly sex scenes.  Also James, if you can't speak like an american, keep your novels about perfect gorgeous smart talented billionaires in love with average lip-biting women set in your own country.  Nobody goes on holiday, pushes a pram, rings people on the phone or uses any other goofy British anachronisms here.<br /><br />Reminds me of that spoof harlequin romance novel title, \\"The Prince and the Under-appreciated Overweight Housewife.\\"  Take out the prince part and you've nailed the general demographic for this book series as well.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great book... can't wait to read the next one. Start off fast and ends even faster. Wasn't wanting it to end.

B0083GPDBO|5.0|I just finished the movie and... I have no words. Just... wow. Excellent film. Some of the scenes were particularly hard hitting -- like the ones with Andrew and his father. But I guess this film proves more than anything that real villains are not born, but made.
B002LOHB0K|5.0|I had ordered the infamous Vestron release of Mad Max for laughs. Although it does seem ridiculous to re-dub a movie in English that was already dubbed in English, they were absolutely right in doing so. I have seem the original Australian release, and the accent is very incomprehensible in parts. It is hilarious that Vestron obviously hired the same people who provide the voices for several kung-fu movies, and worth checking out if you have already seen other versions of Mad Max.
B005K17RU0|5.0|you cant get a better weather app than this! it has more info than the weather guy on Tv.  you will be happy with this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED this trilogy and hope the author decides to continue the \\"Meet Fifty Shades\\" book. This book had all the elements! I couldn't eat or sleep. All I wanted to do I'd READ. These are by far, the best books I've ever read!
B0042TV4IC|5.0|A beautifully done period piece.  You fall in love with the characters, and there is sure to be one that you'll root for.  There are strong female leads which is especially nice for the time period.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|The CD has a great sound quality, and yes while the music itself is a bit of an acquired taste, it's very raw and very addictive. I highly recommend the album.<br /><br />Usually I'm pretty cautious when actually buying a CD, because I'm not going to drop more money on an album that only has two or three good songs. However, the XX was consistently good and the album itself had a nice flow. Some of the songs take a while to get started, but when they do they are great to listen to. Definitely give the entire album a chance.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This organizer works great with my Macleren Volo. It is the perfect size and works well fitting all of my drink needs. A large Nalgene-type water bottle won't fit in the cup holders, but pretty much all my other smaller cups/bottles fit. My only small con is that to close up the stroller, you have to unstrap one side. There is wire inside that helps keep the shape of the organizer, so you have to let it hang from one side when it is collapsed. Not a big deal though.
0061122416|2.0|I remember the hype about this book back when it came out.  All the celebrities were prattling on about it, how it changed their life, how it had so much meaning for them.  Right there I knew I didn't' want to read it, just like \\"The Secret\\" which came out several years later.  Anytime billionaire Oprah tells you a book is \\"life changing\\", you might want to hold onto your wallet - I'm still trying to recover from \\"The Road\\".<br /><br />Nevertheless, a friend gave me this book and I happened to fish it out of my to be read stack before going on vacation recently (everything else in the stack was too heavy for pool-side reading).  So I figured, how bad can 160 pages be?  Well, the book is easy reading at least, but the opportunity cost was the opportunity to read something else (anything else!) which might have held some real meaning, unlike this pseudo-spiritual collection of clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />As I said, the one blessing of the book is that it's easy reading.  I breezed through the book in a matter of a couple hours.  There's nothing to slow you down along the way - no plot, no character development, no poetic language to savor.  Admittedly, there is a very mild St. Exupery flavor, but it's so contrived and watered down that it's like the difference between freshly squeezed orange juice vs. TANG.  Of course, given the popularity of artificial flavoring, it's not surprising how many people rave about this tasteless book.<br /><br />There is the same sense about this book that there is about some modern art.  A sort of, \\"you're kidding me, right?\\"  You find yourself wondering how someone got away with it, how they duped that many people and how they made that much money doing so.  Is throwing a bucket of paint at a canvas really \\"art\\"?  Worth millions of dollars?  You have to wonder whether the perpetrators - the artists, authors, etc. - are really in earnest, or are they aware of the wool they're pulling over our eyes?  Perhaps they actually are in earnest, but you may be left waiting for that small child to call out the obvious nakedness.<br /><br />This book can't really be taken seriously.  It's just a constant hammering of obvious clich&eacute;d Messages dressed up as Wisdom.  It's always darkest before the dawn.  Follow your dreams.  Let your heart be your guide.  It's not what one puts into one's mouth that defiles it, it's what comes out of the mouth.  Recognize any of those?  But no, I'm sure Coelho came up with those all on his own.<br /><br />And, of course, the crowning Clich&eacute; of the book is the biggest whopper of all:  \\"when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.\\"  Right, just the other day I was thinking how much I really wanted a Bentley and, funny thing, when I got home, there was one parked right there in my driveway.  Since then I've wanted a million dollars, a big mansion, lots of friends and worldwide fame and - poof - the universe has granted them.<br /><br />Okay, no, not really.  But even if we set aside material and obviously shallow wants, it's clear that the universe does not always - or even usually - grant us our dreams, even if we really, really badly want them and pursue them fearlessly.  Millions have suffered and died, heartbroken and penniless, in pursuit of failed dreams.  This sort of \\"think it and achieve it\\" mentality is not only foolish, but also rather dangerous.  It places all of the blame for failure on the person who has already failed, thereby compounding their misery.  It's like faith \\"healers\\" who blame the parents of a dying child for not having enough faith, when in fact less faith might have led them to pursue medicine instead.  It's easy enough for already successful people to believe this sort of mentality has been the source of their success and riches, but for most of us, Lady Luck and circumstances don't favor us the way she favors Santiago the shepherd boy or Oprah the miracle billionaire.<br /><br />Books like this one, \\"TheSecret\\" and others aren't merely silly, there's also an insipid element to drawing unsuspecting people into their \\"think and be rich\\" mentality.  People end up spending money and effort on these doomed pursuits of treasures and happiness only to end up despondent and feeling betrayed (while missing the real treasure and happiness of life, which is the work we put into it).  Life isn't actually simple or easy, it's complicated and difficult.  \\"Self-help\\" doesn't consist of getting people to ignore that reality, but rather to help them face it and live it on a daily basis.aren't merely silly, there's also an insipid element to drawing unsuspecting people into their \\"think and be rich\\" mentality.

B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put it down! It may be erotic but the story is the best I have read. I am an avid reader, mostly fantasy, but I can't wait for her next series.
B002NJWHHA|1.0|Maybe I was expecting too much....but this is absolutely god awful. If you have read the books like I have and have high expectations for the movie to be able to mirror the genius of a 17 year old prodigy of an author then you are to be sorely mistaken....<br /><br />The main critical review hits the main points...Arya being an elf yet 15 dollars of silly putty to give her pointed ears was over budget and the acting being completely and utterly embarrassing to the human race...<br /><br />Honestly most of my views were voiced perfectly by most of the one star reviews I was just so utterly appalled at how bad this movie was that I felt I had to try to save the rest of mankind from attempting to enjoy it.

B0086700CM|4.0|I'm so glad I finally got Temple Run on my Kindle Fire! It's great, in my opinion. It can be slow at times, though. I don't know if it's my device, or the game, but it should be checked out just in case.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great application. Easy to navigate and having access to so many versions makes study with this app very easy.  The reading plans are a bonus.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|First of all if you are reading reviews before you have read the book: Be very careful! I have seen quite a few reviews with no spoiler warning who have told way too much of the book. One even told the whole ending in great detal! This is a very romantic and engaging story. I loved it just as I have loved every one of Nicholas Sparks' books and movies. I thought the love between Amanda and Dawson was very strong and real. This is a beautiful love story with many complications just as in life. If you have ever experienced such an all consuming love and lost it you will want to read this book. Nicholas Sparks writes the most romantic love stories I have ever read. He continues to be one of my most favorite authors if not the most. I do not hesitate to buy any of his books because I know I am always in for a wonderfully written love story. Thank you Mr. Sparks! Please keep them coming.
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent writer.<br /><br />For me, this book was about a relationship between two people with issues who worked them out together.  The couple was able to grow together at their own pace without opinions from their friends or family.  I also liked how they compromised with each other.  If something didn't work one way, they would try it the other persons way to see if it would work.  This book for me just confirms that when people are in a relationship it's nobodies business what's going on in the relationship but the two people who are in it.<br /><br />Great read!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun game<br />easy to play but it gets harder as the level goes up. best of all its free and there are zombies
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is one of the best games I have ever played!! It is so much fun.. But, occasionaly (very rarely) does the game ever mess up/stall...besides that it is an awesomely epic game!
1595828753|5.0|As if it wasn't enough that the TV series was awesome - the books are also fantastic. This one picks up where the previous one (The Promise: Part 1) left off: Toph is with Aang, Katara, and Sokka in the Earth kingdom to resolve the issue of Yu-Dao and the Harmony Restoration Movement, while Zuko is seeking help from his father, Ozai about the pressures of being the Fire Lord. There is a subplot with Toph trying to teach Metalbending to her students, and Sokka helping her with it - Sokka's wit is something being greatly missed in Korra, but the book has it spot on.<br /><br />There is an Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Promise: Part 3 that will release in September/October that will conclude this story arc (possibly leading to Republic City!) - I'm eagerly waiting for it.
B006PTL1GC|5.0|After a second viewing, I was totally absorbed by the characters and came to like them, but had been put off by the film at first.  This one of David Cronenberg's best films, a mature and intellectually stimulating work based on a play by Christopher Hampton and a book by John Kerr (screenplay by Hampton), the film presents a rather perverse portrayal of Freud, Jung and their patient and later colleague Sabina all superbly portrayed by Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley.  The usual stellar crew of Cronenberg's is at hand, all completely brilliant.  An admiral but brave view of psychoanalysis.  Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really addictive. Its a great pick for a game never really gets boring. it runs alittle slow on my droid charge but still good
B0000ADY9I|5.0|The Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East is, without a doubt, the greatest live album<br />ever recorded. The late, great Duane Allman's slide guitar, complemented by the other lead guitarist, Dickey Betts, backed up by a rhythm section consisting of bassist, Berry Oakley's melodic playing and two drummers, Butch Trucks and Jaimoe was a rhythm section that feared no time signature and Gregg Allman's Hammond organ and soulful, bluesy voice created music that was difficult to catagorize at the time, it was recorded. The Allmans played classical blues numbers, along with, Gregg's own compositions, created an album that touched on jazz, blues, R&B and rock and when one of the two guitarists took off for an extended solo, it was unknown where, he'd take you.<br />I had the pleasure of being in the audience on the last night of a three night stand at The Fillmore East and except for a bomb scare that delayed the concert, it was one of the greatest concerts, I have ever heard. When they finally finished, the sun was rising in New York And The Allman Brother at the Fillmore East was completed<br />This album stands the test of time. After over forty years, it is still thought of by many people as the greatest live album of all time and I agree completely with that statement!
B000MXPE7O|5.0|The subtle parts of this movie are difficult to  follow, but after watching a few times you get clued into them.<br />Its a spy flick, and a good one if you really take the time to listen.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The new CD by the Beach Boys is absolutely magical. The harmonies and musicality by the guys is incredible. I can recall the first time I heard the Beach Boys, my family and I had moved to Hawaii in 1963. My first introduction was the song \\"Fun, Fun, Fun.\\" It's hard to believe 50 years have passed. This new CD is so up-lifing, it makes you want to hop in your car, put the top down and head for the beach. Thank you Beach Boys for all the wonderful music.... you are the best of the best.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The little Mermaid DVD is in great condition! Now my 2 year old daughter can enjoy this movie since Disney has it locked up in their imaginary vault until God knows when.
0345803485|3.0|...is all the hype. DON'T believe it. The writing is poor, the plot is beyond far-fetched. I'm a little sad she made $30 off me...but I got sucked in, just like everyone else.<br />If you're thinking you'll get hard-core BDSM out of this story, you're gonna be disappointed. I wouldn't even call it porn. There are a few intense scenes, but for the most part, it's no more than a smutty romance novel.<br />However, it was entertaining enough to keep me invested for all three books. Thus, the three stars, rather than one.

0307463745|4.0|I agree that the book resumes the good old \\"Free Agent's Nation\\" strategies from Drive, The Lean Start-up, Linchpin, The Dip, Tribes, Crush it, The Art of Innovation, Getting things done, Made to stick, The 80/20 Principle, Grow, etc.<br />but they should TEACH THEM in the Universities, replacing the fat manipulations from the 60es. Great vacation read, got nice re-work / re-imagine / re-branding ideas for the Autumn. Keep the Signal guys!

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I'm probably in the minority here, I've seen exultating reviews attributing this albums appreciation to feminists and \\"gay men\\".<br /><br />But I'm not gay.<br />Its true I caught the 80's Eurythmics bug, and that bug bit and made an unsettling abcess when I first located a 2nd hand copy of their 1984 soundtrack album. As soon as I spun it, all the eerie gutteral stuff came forward...and this was for the most part...people interpreting ANOTHER PERSON'S STORY!!... Much like some other films I won't mention; the album wound up being better than the film adaptation.<br /><br />In either event, this is a deeply personal collection of songs (despite what Annie might say or mislead on the bonus \\"review\\" disc)... The songs are as true and bold as any pained strained cup of soul from another person in a bygone era....yes, all that stuff that seems to be nearly absent from this generation.<br /><br />As long as music survives that is bred from and touches the soul; then this album fits it all entirely well and more. Annie Lennox is an artist. Respect it.<br /><br />Song reviews?... Look elsewhere, I'm just writing a matter of fact for \\"the minority\\"...they don't teach music appreciation so much...life does. You'll find a lot of that here

0345803485|2.0|This book is okay... If I could go back I wouldn't have bought it. Sometimes the writing is really good but I would say 60% of the writing is so so. I also think the writer read twilight and then set down and wrote this one... but Twilight was a better series.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Almost in tall tale style, an exciting story about excentric figures with just the one thing in common: the amazing will to run unbelievable distances. And about the sinister conspiracy to cripple the feet of mankind. An inspiration for us average middle-aged overweight weekend runners, struggling to keep going 5 miles in a stretch. And probably a very fun-filled read for everybody.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great way to pass time. When I have nothing to do I just start playing it and it's just so fun.
0345803485|5.0|I would first like to comment that the nature of this book is fantasy and it is meant to take readers away to a place that 90% of us would never visit. I purchased this book on a Saturday afternoon and had it finished by Monday night.  I found the characters to be more that just sex.  I think every woman will see some aspects of themselves in Ana.  Christian is fantasy end of story.  But you know what?  It is a fun story and he is a fun, emotional character.  These people who have written these bad reviews need to relax a little and just pick up a book and enjoy it instead of looking for some meaningful message.  I have spoken to no less than a dozen women in my area who have read this book and I have not received one bad review.  I decided to purchase it myself and I loved it.  I have since ordered books 2 and 3 from Amazon and cannot wait for them to arrive.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best app ever made. so addictive. it will keep u playing all the time and that game would b the only u would want. too good. whoever invented this game is a genius

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is amazing. I play it all the time. The only problem I see is that it is too addictive. :) It works wonderfully for the Kindle Fire, so I have no clue what some of the other reviews are saying about how it lags or something. Best game ever!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This was a free app when I got it...so far I am very addicted!  I look forward to solving a puzzle to give myself short relaxation breaks.  I tried Quell but found it frustrating.  So far I have been puzzled but not frustrated by the easy and normal levels.  So if you want an app that gives you the satisfaction of winning through thinking but not having to overdo it...this might be for you!
B007OWG3LM|5.0|For all of the people who are underwhelmed with this album: just listen to Track 3: Varúð. It's simply stunning. People have been throwing around words like \\"lush\\" and \\"ethereal\\" and \\"atmospheric\\" to describe Sigur Rós for years, but there aren't words to describe my experience in listening to this song for the first time. Chills.<br /><br />This is an album that is going to open itself up to the listener after repeat hearings. I wasn't very impressed with Radiohead's latest album, The King Of Limbs, upon first hearing, either, but it took time to assimilate, and now it's one of my favorites. I suspect that will happen for people listening to Valtari as well. Keep listening.
B00881VLCE|4.0|this is the sort of app for the puzzle lovers. the 12piece is easy enough for a 1st grader! you can also download more free ones! a few problems here and there that I hope they fix

B003VANOFY|4.0|The Good -<br /><br />- The quality of the sound is good in MY opinion not great but it will improve over a short amount of time with some 'burn in' - you can actually search Google for burn-in assistance tracks to help you do this.  The reason: trying to acquire the best sound of the product by allowing the burn-in sampling music to bring out the most quality of all levels after time.<br /><br />- It charges by being plugged into it's USB charger/dock - by \\"DOCK\\" - I mean that there's a round black base about 4 inches in diameter that the USB cords coil onto.  On this round base/dock, you can plug the USB Sound-card/wireless-transmitter -- and there's another cable coming off of the DOCK to plug into the headset to charge it - thus needing only 1 USB port to operate.<br /><br />- They are not too heavy - you can find weight-comparisons<br /><br />- They're comfy on my head<br /><br />- The three programmable buttons are cool - they'll let you run Macros, open Apps, whatever is clever - you 'program' it<br /><br />- Microphone works really well and I didn't notice any over-powering problems.. it didn't seem to pick up surrounding sounds.<br /><br />- Wireless kept me connected to my work conference call all around the house (I use Cisco IP Phone)<br /><br />The Bad / Not-so-Good -<br /><br />- The USB-Dock that also retains the USB cables -- be careful with this as uncoiling the cable works fine, but replacing the USB cabling into this round docking station can actually damage the USB cables with the little plastic teeth that HOLD the cabling -- just something to watch out for.<br /><br />- SPL is pretty low compared to others in this range of the market (90 vs. most being around 112)<br /><br />- The 7.1 virtualized surround sound is NOT impressive - and in my opinion it gives off the same quality of echo-chamber type sound that the older (5+ years older) virtualized surround sound systems did.... The quality of the STEREO sound though, is really enjoyable<br /><br />- I was testing the surround in Modern Warfare 3 - and honestly I couldn't tell front to back where shots were coming from... Left and right works great of course.. but this virtualized surround is not for me personally<br /><br />- Charge time indicator reflects VERY inaccurate amount of time left to charge the headset when you have the headset turned ON and plugged in.  So when you are USING the headset, and you plug it in - it may say there's 2 hours left until full charge, however it's about DOUBLE this amount of time.  The problem here - when the headset is turned OFF - the software doesn't come up to tell you how much longer... So, just plan on 4 hours.<br /><br />Overall - There's a lot of quality in this product - built solid, wireless works really good, stereo sound quality's good, microphone is good - but there's enough problem with it for me that I'm not really satisfied and I'll keep searching for a better product... My next one that I will try is the wireless Creative 5.1 (Still Virtualized) that has 50mm drivers, so maybe I'll enjoy the sound from them a bit more./>- I was testing the surround in Modern Warfare 3 - and honestly I couldn't tell front to back where shots were coming from...

0142000671|5.0|I am so very glad that I read this book as an adult for the first time (and had no real idea what it was even about).  I read it in one sitting - it is only short and the language is very easy.  That is not the challenge of this book!<br /><br />Under an hour to read and oh my god - the ending still makes me gasp...<br /><br />But it is a book that you could probably only read with the intense emotion once and that time should not be wasted on a 17 year old!  Once you know the ending it will stay with you forever.<br /><br />This book it a masterpiece.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|If you are an action movie fan, then this is a movie you must see.  The story is very simple and to the point, wasting very little screen time covering what you need to know.  There is a SWAT team that has volunteered to raid a slum that is housing one of the city's most ruthless crime lords, along with all of the thugs he allows to reside in the building.  That's really all you need to know, and the movie moves along from there.<br /><br />The fighting is brutal and well-shot, opting out of the standard shaky-cam style used in more modern action movies, instead giving you a clear picture of exactly what is happening on the screen at all times.  As things escalate further in to the movie, things get move visceral and intense.  When I left the theater I was actually sore from how tense my body was during the majority of it's runtime.<br /><br />I've never written a review here before, but this movie has absolutely encouraged me to do so.  If you're looking for a complex story with a lot of twists and turns, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  If you're looking for a movie with a solid, straight forward story that has more action and hand-to-hand combat than you would believe, then this is definitely a movie you need to watch.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|4.0|My friends had this game for their phones, so I decided to try it for my kindle fire, it's really fun to play, especially when you are very bored.
B005K17RU0|1.0|other than wrong location this worked great until I did this last update....it always used a town sw of us but close enough. Now I can't get it to work other than first page. Whenever l go into weekly forecast or any other than today's weather it tells me network connection is broken. Not so. I uninstalled it.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This is a great game! I have it on my iPad, and I think this is one of the cutest games ever! I love Om Nom! :3
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i enjoy playing this game.  it gives me something brainless to work on.  there are a few bugs that make it hard to give a five star rating but I still enjoy playing.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game if it was the last game on earth I would still beg many different people for this game even if I had to pay for it
145470246X|5.0|The designs in this book are gorgeous! I hope she does another book very soon! Beautifully illustrated. This book will definitely become a favorite of beaders everywhere.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game to play. I can't put it down. everyone should get this game. it needs more coins to collect.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I figured it would be average at best, but to my (pleasant) surprise, it's great, I find myself listening to it repeatedly, which is the ultimate test of any CD. If it's high on your Most Plays list, it's good. Hit singles be damned, Van Halen never was really a singles band anyway.<br /><br />I'm not a big VH fan, but this CD is great, I'd rank it up there as their second-best CD (behind their debut).
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really cool at first I didn't like it but it got a lot better once I got used to it so I give this game a five star rating.
B0086700CM|5.0|u will love it a lot I love so u will love it...I think this game is magnificent and enthusiastic
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app has everything you could want in a bible. Extremely portable, very easy to navigate, simple to cross reference in other versions, GREAT devotional reading plans! I love getting my daily notification reminder to read the parenting by design devotional I am doing. I haven't been so regular in my &quot;quiet time&quot; before this app! It's the first thing I do in the morning. This app has really made it so much simpler to do what I know I should have been faithful to do for years!
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is very fun. One thing I notice though is sometimes it confuses turning and jumping. It reapeats so keep that in mind. I love the coin magnet. I also like that you can buy different characters. There is no point in buying coins because they are really easy to earn. I hope that they will come up with more power ups like flying. If I could I would rate it 6 stars. Looks awesome on the kindle fire!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this last one was the best book in the series.  Fun, action packed read, more than the first two.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. my kids love this game! the graphics are great and its easy enough for my kids to play. it keeps them entertained.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My kids are obsessed with these Percy Jackson books.  They have learned so much about Greek mythology that they now can recite every Greek god and goddess from A to Z, making the snobby neighbors all think they're geniuses (and who doesn't like that?). ;D Because of reading these books, my kids recently corrected me when I pronounced Hermes like the designer scarf, which is NOT how you pronounce the Greek god's name. Egg on face! The kids loved seeing me embarrassed at my lack of knowledge, which for them, made their love of these books all the more pronounced. In summary, they absolutely love these books, all the more because they can show off their well-educated brains to their mother.
B000K7MMP4|4.0|Let us be clear. This was definitely from the 80s. It involves the most volumized & violently teased reinterpretation of Georgian curls ever seen in a period film, and liberally.<br /><br />That said, if you've seen and loved the 1995 BBC enough times, you'll get a kick out of recognizing those crucial quirks of manner and characterization--sometimes the expressions are even exactly the same--it seems like every one of the BBC actors borrowed VERY liberally from this version! And the characters, if you can force yourself to be sufficiently open-minded about it all, really do very well. The 1995 BBC also borrows liberally from the tone, pace, and staging of this movie, and I think it deserves at least a little credit for setting such foundations.<br /><br />Some things will probably irk or confuse you: Kitty and Lydia are indistinguishable; Caroline and Louisa have had their colorings and personalities swapped (if, like me, you find the BBC 1995 to be the true canon), Jane is a brunette who looks like a blend of Rosamund Pike and Jennifer Ehle (confusing!!) with Liv Tyler; Lizzie is lighter (like I said, confusing) and looks like a hot 80s American coed, not a classic British country-style beauty. The film also seems to have decided that the way to demonstrate her \\"fine eyes\\" is to give her (and nobody else) hilariously racoonny 80s-style grey eyeliner. ANd I agree with those who have no idea what Mary's doing. What are you doing, Mary? Why do you have Lizzie's lines?<br /><br />Despite all that, the characterizations really grow on you! Hard to drive Colin Firth out of my head for long enough, but I think in all fairness this may be really the finest and truest Darcy on film. And Lizzie grows on you a lot. Takes a while to get used to the hyperenunciation and stilted style of the delivery, but it settles down, and our leading couple's chemistry is fantastic.
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|Been a fan of FF for more than 15 years I saw in the last couple of years the lineup changes, the core of band belong to Burton and Dino and Rhys as a important member. The Industrialist simple if a gem in his own kind. Since the opening intro you hear what is coming a modern industrial record that only FF can deliver.<br /><br />The clean voices of Burton simple are awesome, overall a great vocal performance. Highlights from the album New Messiah, God Eater, Virus of Faith. The deluxe edition came with two additional tracks where you can find Landfill (Pitchshifter Cover)a dark trackto end the record.<br /><br />This is a no brainer if you want to hear quality metal simple buy this and support the band.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app and think that everyone should get it. Every time i turn on my kindle fire thats wat i play for hours on end.U r certain to have an addiction.Everybody should get this app because u will love it. I know that me and all my friends do.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I wish they made these for cell phones and iPods.  The cover is strong and easy to use.  The screen protector is amazing.  It just clings to the screen with a perfect fit and has a nice Matte finish which take down the glare. There is absolutely no loss of action on the touch screen.  Highly recommended!! This should last life of the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Please make these for cell phones.  No other product out there is as good as this.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game.The monster is so cute!I learner how to draw him.This game has all sorts of crazy obstacles.The spiders are really hard.They keep on stealing my candy!

1591841216|1.0|A man named Paul Arden once wrote a stupid book, people bought the book because of its stupidity. He later became rich and famous for writing stupid books.
B004XE0P5E|4.0|I loved this album the first time I heard it.  Listened to it again with headphones and heard the F-word. So I had to check the lyrics and found it in an another song as well.  It is so disappointing when great artists stoop to using that word in their music.  Have we lost the ability to communicate effectively without it?  Had to delete those two songs! Big pet peeve of mine.  I know most people don't care about it, but I'm throwing it out there for the others who do.
1591843790|4.0|\\"Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions\\" is filled with great advice. Guy Kawasaki not only offers insights based on his own experience, but he also points the reader to many other great books that offer a more in-depth analysis on each topic. I definitely recommend this book.
0670023329|5.0|An amazing account based on first person experience of DPRK's political prison.  It reads like a suspense novel, but are factual accounts that indict the North Korea's government of the worst crimes against humanity.  I believe this is our generation's Hitler, and we must address it - else I am afraid we will become the spineless old folks that the next generation will understandably despise and ridicule for lack of moral fortitude.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|Before watching this film, I heard many people overly criticize Daniel Radcliff's performance, these comments coming mainly from those who were die hard Harry Potter fans who were saddened by the end of the franchise.  I, for one, enjoyed Harry Potter, but loved that Daniel Radcliff was so easily able to come out of the roll of HP and play Arthur so beautifully, he is definitely a true talent and I look forward to seeing his later works.  As per Woman in Black, we have a classic haunting story, with far more twists and turns as the haunting is not isolated to the single location or family, the involvement is deeper, this is not just about the bumps in the night.  The location and era were very well done, the entire cast, and character development was believable.  The \\"lulls\\" in the film are not drawn out time killers, but if you pay attention, they are clues to the characters and what is to come, making them, to me, interesting.  I found the film to be excellent, especially in a time where the best box office films have included unrealistic craziness such as Saw and Paranormal Activity films.  The only reason I have chosen 4 and not 5 stars is because I felt the film could have been longer and added more to the back story of the family, and maybe more to the ending, even.  But all in all, I would give Woman in Black an 7.5/10.
0393080269|5.0|Great Book.. Ruchir has explained the psychology among masses (matching and opposite) and its impact on the respective economies throughout the world in last couple of decades, with Western World and China as basis.<br /><br />Line/analysis I liked the most: Chinese are much less likely than any other nationality to believe that China is destined to be the number one economy in the world anytime soon, and are more likely to understand the possibility of pitfalls ahead. (Exactly opposite from where the story starts in Delhi; \\"Where else the money will go?\\")
0345803485|4.0|There have been tons of reviews for this book and while I do agree with some of the media my personal opinion of this book is pure bliss. For me reading and falling in love with the characters is what the book is about. It may not have proper English language but if one book can get so many people to read then it's two thumbs up!
B006ZZANG0|5.0|There's something operatic and grandiose about Wainwright's work that instantly caught my attention and has kept me a fan ever since I discovered his music.  His work is unique and memorable.  That's why I'm happy to find that this latest CD has rebounded from the dirge sound of his last offering, returning to his fanciful roots.<br />I much prefer happy Rufus to sad Rufus.
0345803493|2.0|I like the story in general. I get that these kind of writing goes over the limit with its corny narration but enough is enough. For a woman that graduated college and is working as acting editor, she's awfully immature, the reader will most likely get tired of all the \\"my inner goddess\\" and \\"my conscience with her half moon specs\\" nonsense. The writer should grow up a bit and keep in mind these kind of books are directed to an adult audience. Even Stephanie Meyer has more serious internal debates than the ones in these books. I always finish what I start but if it wasn't for the rest of the characters I don't think I could have finished the books. The narration is just too annoying and becomes monotonous, retarded and childish instead of naive.<br />I don't understand why writers choose these \\"hot but not aware of it, smart but always second guessing myself\\" women. D'you know? there's a reason even Anastasia loves English literature, it's real and deep. I think the author took no risks, all the people in it are handsome, wealthy and smart. This is a x O.C
B006WXW098|5.0|With her latest CD, Yuja Wang established herself as the best living performer of Scriabin's piano music. Of the deceased pianists, only Horowitz was her equal. Wang's ability to bring out the nuance, drama, and ultra-sweetness of Scriabin's music is incredibly moving, especially in the Prelude, Opus 11, #11. Yuja's Rachmaninoff selections are also wonderfully interpreted, particularly the Elegy, Opus 3, #1. The pacing and shading of her performance is even better than Rachmaninoff's own rendition. The other pieces on her Fantasia CD are equally satisfying, in terms of excellent musicianship and breathtaking technique. The only composition that I don't care for is the Sorcerer's Apprentice, a piece that repulsed me ever since I heard it in the Disney film 50 years ago. The Carmen Variations, labeled White House version, is actually closer to Horowitz's 1968 TV performance. The actual White House version uses a different ending, similar to that which Horowitz did on 60 Minutes in 1977. Yuja Wang's Danse Macabre also differs somewhat from Horowitz's recorded version. A section of the piece is missing, presumably because Yuja learned the piece from a faulty written transcription. Nevertheless, these flaws are minor. On the whole, Wang's Fantasia CD is an example of superb pianistic ability and insight. I heartily recommend it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this app.  I play it on my kindle fire not linked to social media so not sure what people are talking about.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I loved this book, and could absolutely not put it down. The author creates a world where love is a disease and great lengths are taken to avoid becoming 'infected.\\" It reminded me a lot of \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowery, but I feel the author illustrates the idea of government control over society with a fresh approach. The focus on a world that is entirely practical, but without the feeling of love was thought-provoking.<br /><br />The book has a lot of very strong quotable quotes that make you genuinely stop and wonder whether love is worth the risk and pain. To me, a sign of excellent literature is the book challenges your preconceived notions and ideas. This book definitely does that, and in the end I found myself wondering \\"what would I have done?\\" Immediately after finishing \\"Delirium,\\" I began reading \\"Hana\\" and counting down the days until \\"Pandemonium\\" was released.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dystopian novels.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I  read a few of the Barsoom books as a kid. I never finished the whole saga. I went on to discover the original Conan by Robert E. Howard and did not get back to ERB. I plan too soon though.<br /><br />The film JOHN CARTER was an enjoyable and very well made film. I was sucked into the story much like I was as a kid reading the books. I was transported to the wonder of Barsoom.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect,but it is fun and the characters are alive and interesting. Great story and I thought the adaptation from the books works well for the movie.<br /><br />Overall it has been my favorite movie this year.
B0053TMP24|4.0|it was quite hilarious in my perspective so i encourage you to read it to get a few laughs and just to get kids to get off their computers and read it!
B0082JYAZ2|4.0|This album was SO close to perfection.  All it need was the track from the Deluxe Edition to make this album truly complete.  Call Them Brothers was meant to be connected to this, not featured as a bonus [Non-Album] track.  Every time I listen to this album I have to Add Call Them Brothers To Now Playing and pretend its supposed to be there.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The large size makes this easy to use and see at direct sales parties. It's just what I was needing. It. would be nice to see the answer to a previous calculation, but I could borrow a scientific calculator for that. I like it and it's free!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game on the kindle fire. it took it a long time to finally be on the app store. it is just like the ipod  version but the screen is bigger. I would recommend it to anyone.
0802130208|5.0|Nothing quite falls flatter than failed comedy. I've read several critical reviews here that claimed that this book was hideously unfunny. Now I could not disagree more with that sentiment. I found this book to be brilliantly funny, as satire sometimes can be. Not funny in the same way an Adam Sandler movie wants to be, but more like a Twain or Vonnegut adventure, where the human condition is unceremoniously revealed to be comically grandiose in its own self-delusions.<br /><br />Once you get to know Ignatius and his pals, you'll be glad you stayed on for a bit. He remains one of the great characters of fictional literature. Many a writer could learn something from how carefully and completely he is deveolped throughout the book. I found it a joy to read, and I will soon read it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an avid hard sci-fi reader. I have been enjoying a lot more sci-fi as of late on my Kindle and came across this gem of a series. I enjoy stories exploring future history and the implications of our use of technology run amok. We live in a time where it seems more and more control is being asserted by fewer and fewer. This story explores the worst possible realization of a few who think they know best. The story reminded me of Dune in many ways, my favorite series of all time. I simply couldn't stop reading and sadly finished reading the collected stories in a day. I want more, so much more and Mr. Howey, I would gladly pay a premium to continue enjoying your fine writing. The story explores man rising to his best in the midst of the worst. The main characters are characterized well. The writing is fluid and well done. The themes are thought provoking and terrifying. What's not to love?! There is so much potential for this series, I can't wait to read the prequel I just bought. Keep it coming Mr. Howey. I hope Fox does better with the movie than Universal did with Waterworld. Your self published success has inspired me to finally write my own sci-fi stories I have been thinking about for long while.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. but it lags but that's ok it fun it is the best game ever I cant stop playing it its so much fun everyone should buy this

1612130283|2.0|Feeling the peer pressure of seemingly every woman in the country (well at least it seems that way, there are gaggles of women every week on the news talking about this book)...I cave, and click the magic Amazon button and two seconds later...badda bing Kindle ready.<br /><br />I try to take precautions and research how to hide a book on my IPad, how to put a password on a book..to no avail.  Please God, don't let My kids use my IPad for Angry Birds and come across THIS.<br /><br />From: A Mom with 2.5 kids and barely time to read People magazine<br />Subject: Fifty Shades of Grey in a NUTshell<br />Date : June 3 2012<br />To : Females of the world<br /><br />You're reading porn.  You can call it erotica, if it makes you feel better.  Please don't call it Romance, I beg of you.  E L James didn't invent BDSM, she just made it easily available for the average woman to read about it. Courtesy of the Fifty Shades support group seen on GMA, today's woman is surrounded by her mental female force shield and may read it wherever and whenever she wants...without eyebrows being raised. (well, maybe by that crotchety old woman at the library, but she's just jealous.)<br /><br />The quality of writing left something to be Desired (eye roll, no spank, thanks).  Christian Grey is Beautiful, he's Handsome, he's Beguiling.  When women look into his cool, gray eyes they immediately fall under his Bewitching spell.  It takes the strength of a woman's Inner Goddess to stand up for oneself and break away from the gaze.  (Hey you, Inner Goddess, we get that you're in there - a total of 57 times, or once an average of every 6.5 pages, but who's counting.)<br /><br />I hated Mr. Grey, Sir.  And then I felt sorry for him when I made the foreshadowing-on-the-wall connection of the lack of any worthwhile child pox to the torture he must've experienced; that left both physical and sniff- emotional scars.  Be careful here ladies, abused becomes abuser.  It's a well known pattern. Not a love story.<br /><br />We all know that he's a Control Freak (\\"Control\\" gets an honorable 50 mentions).  He denies Ana time with friends, family.  He won't let her drive her POS car.  He wants her to dress and eat differently.  And of course, be submissive always.<br /><br />So, why do we want to read further about this relationship?  Because he's a Challenge (with baggage).  And women LOVE the bad guy.  And Christian Grey is bad AND hot.  What could be better?  Ana can change him AND heal him!. By reading this book, WE support HER!<br /><br />He is an unfrozen Edward Cullen, complete with the bite tendencies.  Just ...ahem...not only on the neck.  Will Ana win where Bella didn't?  Will she change him, instead of him 'changing' her? Like the Twilight series, the writing is sub-par, overstated, and lengthy.  And similar to Twilight, it is difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />Unlike Twilight, I feel like there are no unusual twists.  She will DOMinate.  She will transform him.  There's not a ton of surprises here.  I may read the next two books to see where they get married, honeymoon, and what they name their baby. Gracarla? Wink, wink Twilight fans.<br /><br />Yes, there is a ton of 'heat' in this book. There is no denying that this is going to make you sweat under the collar, skin blush, and look over your shoulder to ensure no one under the age of 30 is standing behind you. You get to be a voyeur into the Red Room of Pain peep show.  Interesting, intriguing, and provocative would be an understatement.<br /><br />Another highlight, in my mind, is the back and forth emails between Ana and Christian. They are humorous, sarcastic, sad, romantic, and as close to reality in a relationship that this book conveys.  They make you actually believe this story is possible, and that somewhere out of this insanity of cruelty and satiety, love will prevail.<br /><br />Read it, don't read it. Doesn't matter to me, we didn't sign a Contract.  I'm not impressed by the abuse - physical, emotional, and otherwise.  I don't believe that anyone should be treated like a dog ~ led around by a chain, made to lay down for a treat, and told who's pack they can hang with. However, I do in the end, appreciate the hot-steamy-attractiveness of Mr. Grey and Miss Steele's quasi arrangement.<br /><br />I do hope they can maintain that aspect, that this trilogy beginning is not As Good As It Gets, and in the final book (assuming I can skim through that far) Ana gets to hear Christian whisper<br /> ~  \\"You make me want to be a better man, but don't bite your lip. It turns me on.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been addicted to Temple Run ever since I played it on my friends' devices. I was thrilled when it was finally released for the kindle fire!!! I love this game!
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe they finnaly put temple run in the appstore! I love it so much.All you people who say whenever it stops you it makes you die; your wrong.It gives you three seconds.
B0086700CM|4.0|its a good app but I hate the noise the coins make when you collect them! But otherwise its a nice app :)
0345803485|1.0|The publicist for this book should be paid in solid gold.  Imagine you are trying to sell this book.  The story here is straight stock romance novel--virginal heroine who doesn't know she's beautiful finds herself in a passionate sexscapade with a worldy, rich, gorgeous, brooding sex machine who finds HIMSELF unable to resist her heady combination of innocence and unexplored sensuality.  She is a breath of fresh air in his dark, lonely, world.  Can she save him from his own tortured soul?<br /><br />Sound familiar?  Let's see--How to sell this?  I know--get it banned somewhere!  Tell people it's just TOO hot for some libraries to carry!  I knew it was a romance, but I thought I would at least learn something about people who are into bondage...<br />Ended up being pretty boring stuff.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|I was deployed on board the uss abraham lincoln when i received a kindle fire from a drawing it was a couple weeks before i would see land again but even not registered i could watch movies. so when we finnaly pulled into bahrain and i could get internet access i bought some music the only problem is that i lost my internet connection during my download and when i came back the next day to try to finish and amazon would not let me restart my download so for a normal person with good internet it should work awesome. oh and awol nation is a pretty good cd i just wish i had the full download :(
B007Q476KU|5.0|I rented this so my wife and I could watch a movie. It was great and well worth the price paid.
B00000E2QI|5.0|Riccardo Chailly is a master. The timpani in the O Fortuna are icredibly powerful, and in my opinion sound wonderful. The Chorus is magnificent. Of all the Carmina's I've heard, this one has to be the best one.
0515142247|5.0|If you want to be entertained,, read all the Jack Reacher books by Lee child.<br />Reacher is a man who does not want much to do with people but always seems to become involved with them. If he decides to fight he is a brutal animal. This guys kicks butt.<br />This whole series should be made into movies.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|With friends and family we have been seeing the Beach Boys live in concert since the late 1970's. We saw them June 2nd at the Hollywood Bowl, and again on June 3rd at Irvine Ampthire. Both nights everyone agreeded the music and harmonies were the best anyone had ever heard. We saw kids, young adults, and my folks (in their late 70's) all visably deeply enjoying every note. But when the band played songs from \\"That's why God Made the Radio\\" we saw tears, the new songs are sooooooo good. When our pre-ordred CD arrived, we had a listening party BBQ, re-inviting everyone that went to the concerts with us, and other friends and family. Wow, the songs hit everyone in a very special way, the kid's loved it, and everyone went on line and ordered the music on Amazon. If you have been hoping for the return of the Beach Boys of the 60's my friends they have arrived, and music like this is why God made the radio.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|To one keenly interested in American Histoy, is the reason the DVD John Adams was purchased.  David McCullough as a commentator and an historian of sorts, rated high in ones opininon.  But when the name Tom Hanks was mentioned, it was as if,  oh, oh, beware - Balonywood may be par for the course in this so called historical movie as there may be injected psychohistory distorting the story of John Admas and his contribution to the founding of our government.<br /><br /> Balonywood usualy always requires two things in the making of a movie - visual sexuality, and nudity.  This movie truly has its outstanding moments, BUT.......be prepared for Balonywoods scripted psychohistory moments.  Case in point the visual scene of the sex activity between Adams and his wife Abigail when she arrived in Paris. And the bare breast when Adam's daughter was being preped for cancer surgery.  Add too such dialogue woven into the script itself.<br /><br />The most egregious Balonywood's moment came in the depictation of Thomas Jefferson and his often repeated but untrue relationship with Sally Hemings. Sally Hemings was a slave and a maid to Jeferson's daughter Polly.  Jefferson last saw Sally when she was 11 or twelve. She acompanied Polly when Polly came to Paris to be with her father.  At that time Sally was about 14, incompetant and needed someone to take care of her.  Abigail Adams who was aboard ship the same time as Polly and her maid, wrote Jefferson concerning Sally: \\"The girl she has with her wants more care than the child, and is wholly incapable of looking properly after her without some superior to direct her.\\"<br /><br />During Jefferson's lifetime he fell in love with two womem -  his adored wife Martha, who passed away, and a beautiful accomplished woman in France named Maria Cosewell.<br /><br /> The case for Sally having been Jefferson's mistress is based largely on the writing/charges of James Callender, a nortorious dealer in character assassination who was employedby Jefferson's political enemies during his first term as president of the United States in 1873.  Unfortunately for our generation the infamous psycohistory buff/witer Fawn Brodie took up these charges and magnified them. She and others say they have proof in that certain slaves at Monticello are said to have borne a resemblance to Jefferson. Those who want to believe Jefferson himself is responsible ignore that two of Jefferson's nephews Peter and Samual Carr lived at Montecello and that one, Samuel, had confessed that he had fathered some of Sally's progeny.  Jeferson's grandaughter Ellen Randolph called her cousin Samuel \\"the most nortorius good-natured Turk that ever was master of a black seraglio (harem) kept at other men's expense.\\" For this movie to pertetuate the lie/myth of Sally and Jefferson romantic involvelment -  and that she was at his bedside when he died does an injustice to Jefferson and to Sally Hemmings.<br />If one can bear these psychohistory interjections/myths/dialogue and scenes; along with the actor depicting John Adams speaking with a wad of cotton in his mouth it is balonywood intertaining striving to be its best - but in fact missing the mark!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I caved and decided to buy the 50 Shades of Grey book since many of my friends and coworkers couldn't stop talking about it. The book was slow to start and I felt that James kept repeating herself to get her point across when she didn't have to. This book was definitely a housewife fantasy story since some of the characters were somewhat of a stretch especially the main character.  If you have every been curious about these types of books then this a good book to start with.
B0086700CM|5.0|This was awesome.... I was waiting for it to come out for the kindle fire.....it is totally worth buying or downloading cause its f-u-n FUN!
B007P6VM04|5.0|The music from is excellent as is the show. Really enjoyed both. The shipping was quick and the cd's were fine. Will buy again. Would like to see everybody who watched the show buy the cd. I am looking forward to season 2. Thanks!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun,  addictive,  and free. It really doesn't get much better for twitch gamers than this. Endless runner fans rejoice because it's finally on Kindle Fire
B007J4T2G8|1.0|When I first read about this book I was excited I couldn't wait to read it. I've read my good share of erotic novels and the cover was mysterious and begged you to read it. Unfourtunately, it was nothing like I pictured. I only finished this book because I wanted to make sure when I wrote a review about it, I could honestly say I read it. Now Anastasia..I don't like female characters that are simpering fools for hot guys, Christian is hot get over it. And oh my goodness!! I hated that she kept blushing and biting her lip!! And Christian..a sophisticated billionaire who has slept with so many women can be turned on by Ana biting her lip?? He's also a creepy stalkers and just because hes hot and rich he gets away with it! And did anybody notice that this is almost like twilight! There were so many parts! All in all this book was mellow when it came to sex. This to me is not erotic but romance with a bit of spice because in all the erotic novels Ive read not once did they say \\"down there\\".
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So I read a few romance novels and since this was a best seller I figured it had to be good. First off if you want a book to have a plot this one is not for you. It is completely ridiculous, and the BIG secret is more creepy than anything, the sex scenes become monotonous, and as you begin to wonder if this book is actually going somewhere it ends. There is no real conflict, no climax nothing! I recommend the Kathleen Turner series if you are looking for a plot and some romamce.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game ever in the world it is so fun i bet if you ever play this game you would love it and would never stop.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game I am on it all the time. I would recommend to every one I know. love it
B0086700CM|5.0|It's very entertaining when you have nothing to do. I been waiting for Temple Run to be on the Amazon App Store. I'm glad they finally have for the Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was constantly telling my niece to stop playing that game, and now I'm addicted. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night reaching for this game!
B0036T32LQ|5.0|Wow. I did not expect this movie to be as awesome as it was. It's a bit slow to start, but after the first 20-30 min, it starts winding up. All the way until the end. It's the equivalent of McEscher in video form. Simply amazing. I'll probably watch it again to see what else I may have missed.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a decent quality bag and has withstood three weeks of pretty rough use without any issues. What I have in this bag : NikonD5100, 18-55mm Lens, 55-300mm Lens, Battery Charger, Cables and a couple of lens kits and cleaners. I also stuffed in an 7\\" android tablet, an ipod, chargers for the tablet and phone, extra USB cables. Theres still room for one more lens in there.<br /><br />Having a backpack is so much more convenient and comfortable then a regular camera pouch. Go for this, you wont be disappointed.
0062071017|5.0|I just couldn't stop once I started reading. The cases support and drive each strategic decision point. The book is articulated very well - capturing the essence of Strategic thinking.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|I enjoyed watching this film and would give it more like 3.5 stars. Plenty of action and I didn't feel the film dragged. Could it have used more editing? Probably. And big green aliens with four arms and horns, always interesting. What ruined it for me was the ending. Stop here if you don't want a spoiler. John Carter proposes to the princess and they barely know each other. I mean they haven't even kissed. It was like there had to be a happily ever after ending and when John got down on one knee, I just rolled my eyes. He was prettier than her too.
0439023513|2.0|SPOILERS:<br />The author excels when describing life in the arena, however there is no arena in this book.  Her storytelling of life in sector 13, sector 2, and the rebel takeover of the capitol are not so exciting, and often fail to ring true. Character development also failed in that by the end of Mockingjay I was quite ambivalent about the characters.  I also would have liked to find out if President Snow told the truth about President Coin, surely intelligence would have been able to figure it out.  And the ending.......isn't life better for her children then it would have been had she not rebelled?  Isn't there any comfort there?
0756686970|5.0|My son loves Lego Minifigs (particularly LEGO Star Wars)and this book feeds his addiction well.  It comes complete with large full color pictures of EVERY Star Wars Minifig, which movie or show they are in, a short description as well as which LEGO set they can be found in.  Basically, everything my kid is passionate about.  It's reasonably priced and he loves it.
0439023491|3.0|First half of book was slow to develop.  Once we were back in the arena the story telling finally picked up and became interesting.  In my opinion the author is very good with creating and describing the hunger games, but fails to engage when writing about life outside of the games.  This only gets worse in book 3.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great basic calculator!  I use it all the time to do household tasks like bills and taxes--- nice size and responsive.
B00012QM8G|5.0|These images will endure for a lifetime and they should.  Spielberg promised his mother to one day make a film of this sort about the holocaust.  An ultimate gift to all humanity and an eternal story that will hopefully never be forgotten.  A tribute to the human spirit--and a reminder to all of us of the ever-necessary struggle against complacency and self-interest on the part of \\"the comfortable ones\\" who can survive and even benefit from such crimes against humanity.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love this game.  Definitely makes you think. OK on a phone w/ a larger screen but way better on tablet. Instructions are easy to understand & click & drag is great for filling in/deleting lines. Smooth play, visually appealing.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|hey everyone,<br />  this game is the best!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!! I can play with my friends and other people too!!!! It is fun on all devices!!!! Some games are not fun when they have a full version and a free version, but as for this game the free version is fun!!! Another good thing is that they don't pester you about geting the full version!!!!!<br />You are missing all the fun if you don't get it!!!!<br />:D
B006Z21ZJC|4.0|The DVD is a pretty good concert and shows exactly what Iron Maiden is capable of. Steve Harris and Bruce Dickson kills it. Also it contains almost all the successes by the band, like Hallowed be thy name and The Trooper. Good buy!
B0086700CM|5.0|well I kept waiting and waiting for this app to come out and finally!!! it comes out! I'm like addicted haha
0439994349|5.0|This series came out when I was in the 6th grade. The contents made to barely fit in between the cover sheets had to have been magic itself as it is simply uncontainable. Not merely a fantasy world but worlds between worlds, uncountable worlds in which the different layers of ourselves are either more hidden or blatantly tangible and the impossible has never been more of an easy task to accomplish. Elements of many different lore, mythology, and unique imaginative creation come together to bring us a story of heroism, sacrifice, and adventure.
B007MAETA8|1.0|I've been a John Mayer fan for years but didn't really bother with Battle Studies just because I was getting bored with his direction. So the other day my Wife wanted to buy Born and Raised....boy was I let down. My first thought was that when Darrius Rucker went country it was a really good album and this sucks. This was just slow country music that sounded like the same song just twisted around to make a whole album. I miss the John Mayer Trio days....oh well John you've probably got my last $10.00 for one of your albums.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love fried chicken and this game but when I try to do both it gets the screen greasy hahahaha ahhahahaha lololololol
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game but I need to be doing other things ...it is addicting I recommend it to all solitaire junkies
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Great game, just wish you didn't have to pay to get the good stuff. :/ Kinda ruins it. Oh well, I guess. It's still pretty fun.<br />7/10 From me.
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Bought the CD when it first came out and it can only be played from the embedded player on the CD. It says you can copy into your library but it was very tricky. Upgraded my computer and now the CD is not supported and will not play at all. I am very unhappy with this because now I have to buy the album all over again in a new format. The CD has now become a coaster. Other than that, the album is great with awesome songs. Wish I could listen to it more.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its good. Its a lot like the original version but its quite lagging. Its hard to play like that when it has too much lag.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|luv this game very addictive fun to watch the movie easy to make coins wish it was easier to get acorns!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun! its addictive and it gets your reflexes working. I would reccomend this game to anyone.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is an inspirational story, whether you're a fan of the military or not. Eric has done a masterful job telling a very moving story of failure, resolve, and success. If it doesn't bring a rear to your eye, then you haven't read \\"Fearless.\\" Congratulations, Eric!<br />Barb
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I like logic games and this one is a lot of fun. The puzzles get harder as you go so keep playing if it seems too easy at first.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this in hopes that it would allow me to hear music better on an airplane. After purchasing this item, I read that doing this could cause hearing damage. When it arrived, I figured I would try it out and see if the device provided a boost to my audio quality. My music sounds amazing now. I strongly recommend you buy this.
B0086700CM|5.0|So happy this FINALLY came out for tablet/kindle fire ^_^  I loove this game so much,  Its a free game with a paid value :D<br /><br />BEST.GAME.EVER
B0086700CM|5.0|a fast fun game that will keep you busy trying to conquer it. you won't. want to stop. it's not an easy game to beat.
B0086700CM|5.0|a fun twist on the typical &quot;pitfall&quot; style game. easy to use controls and almost random scenery changes make it an adventure each time you play.
B0086700CM|1.0|borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring bore I bet I spelled that wrong oh well ive never played this game before butt my friends told me it was lame and boring okay bye now!
