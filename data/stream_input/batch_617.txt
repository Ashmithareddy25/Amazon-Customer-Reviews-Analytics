0790737973|5.0|This film blends the some of the truest suspense I've ever seen in film, claustraphobic trauma, and true artful storytelling. <br /> <br />Please watch this film if you like sci-fi, it's very worthwhile.
B000E41MS6|5.0|OK, this review is for everyone who NEVER saw the original -- because like you, neither did I. <br /> <br />I grew up with the usual American sci-fi TV:  Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica (dicso 70's version), Lost In Space, Space 1999, X-Files.  I was even a fan of the short-lived \\"Space: Above & Beyond\\".  Never watched the original Dr. Who, because it just looked too campy. <br /> <br />But when Sci-Fi channel resurrected this series, I got curious.  So I rented it via Netflix, and I gotta tell you, this is a GREAT sci-fi series! <br /> <br />It's a little PG, so for those looking for something edgy with intrigue and gore, this won't be for you.  The CGI, not exactly top form, but pretty darned good when compared with what's out there.  The series has a feel that's a little bit Monty Python, a little bit \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\", and a little bit...well I can't figure out the other bit, but its very good. <br /> <br />The new Dr., played by Christpher Eccleston, is a very likable character, and Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) is the UK Britney Spears only not a dumb blond.  She's got a little bit of the \\"Bond Girl\\" good looks, but she's no helpless female, and she helps keep the viewer anchored in the modern 21st Century mindset, which is important since there's so much jumping about throughout time and space. <br /> <br />What really surprised me was how faithful this series was to the original.  From the theme song, to the appearence of the Tardis, to even the look of the arch villain race of Daleks, everything done here is faithful to the original series, which began in the UK back in 1963 (take that all you trekkers!).  Moreover, Dr. Who ran continuously for over 25 years on UK television, which is more than you can say for Star Trek or even the Simpsons.  When you consider how much American Television is shamelessly reinterpreted (well, ripped-off is more like it) for the US, then that alone should make you curious as to why this concept and story has endured for so very long in a culture so similar to our own. <br /> <br />Fans of Sci-Fi who are not Star Trek/Star Wars elitists will really enjoy it, and strangely, my 10 year old daughter and I really enjoy watching it together, so for parents who want to find good family friendly TV programming that won't dull their brains will not be dissappointed by purchasing this boxed set!
0393327655|5.0|Harris woke me up with his bold and simple message: religion not only doesn't work, but is cruel and murderous. Why can't we humans shed the stuff that doesn't serve us? Harris gives evidence of this non-serving aspect of religion. Most convincing are his excerpts from the various \\"holy books.\\" It's impossible for a compassionate and rational human being to read these excerpts and not agree with Harris' conclusion.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|Steven from Tennessee is wrong - this is NOT how these movies were presented.  The celluloid from which they were shown had a 2:35:1 aspect ratio - and were essentially \\"anamorphic.\\"  I can live with the sound, but it absolutely ludicrous for this to not be anamorphic on DVD.  I can encode anamorphic home movies with a single mouse click - from a \\"letterboxed 4:3\\" source.  If Lucasfilm can't - I think they need some new people.
0385751060|5.0|I agree with the other posts that mention that this book is better not knowing much about it. The vagueness of the book's own synopsis and the first page are what caught my attention. It begins with the main character coming home to find the maid packing all of his belongings. This historical fiction book is good even for adults. It brings World War II from a different perspective, one from a boy whose father is a member of the Germany Army. While details are vauge, a child would be able to relate to Bruno as he too has no idea what is happening in the world around him.
B00000JPH6|5.0|THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LABRYNTH! AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE THAT MOVIE SEEM TO NOT LIKE THIS ONE. GOOD BECAUSE I HATE THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE LABRYNTH! IT'S LIKE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO LIKE FIGHT CLUB BUT NOT DEATH TO SMOOCHY! THEY JUST DON'T GET IT  THE SAME PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE SECRET OF NIMH! WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUST KILL OVER AND DIE! GO WATCH YOUR ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW! STAR WARS? ARE YOU SERIOUS ? GET A LIFE! f*** STAR WARS! NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE STAR WARS BUT WHY WOULD YOU EVEN MENTION THAT MOVIE HERE? IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ONE!
6304698690|5.0|I remember when I was younger and watched the 1987 Hallmark version, and was too young to understand the low quality acting portrayed in the movie. However I was enchanted with the story at that age. However now that I'm older and have seen it again, I do not think I like it that much. So I came to this version very skeptical. However I should've known that Warner Brothers would have pulled it off. They changed the story a bit, making it an earthquake instead of cholera that killed Mary's parents, however it's a minor detail that I think could afford to have been changed. Warner Brothers even kept the British Alchemical symbolism strong in it, which I'm quite pleased with. Over all the acting and setting blew me away and trust me, it's quite well worth buying. As I always say, a job well done is worth buying. You won't be sorry for buying this treasure to add to your cove.
B000H0MKGK|3.0|With all I've heard about his recent studies of jazz I was expecting a little more.  That's not to say that it is bad, but it is much smoother than I had personally anticipated.  For the most part mellow, the lyrics are fitting and mature and many of the songs have a simpler rhythm than in past albums.  The sound is softer, the vocals are agreeably John Mayer.  I like the earlier stuff better, but even those took time to grow on me before I decided they were great.  It's just not what I expected, which is to say the least, slightly jazzier, slightly bluesier, and not nearly so mellow.  It feels to me a little like a lost edge of something to prove to the world in the way of music.  He's made his mark already; as to whether this is good or bad is yet to be be determined.
B0000013GV|5.0|In the last few years Outkast may have alienated the bulk of their original audience but there's still no denying how truly magnificent this album is. Amongst my many many records there are a select few that need to be replaced every couple of years because they are so over-played that they become physically unlistenable. This is one of them. Big Boi and Dre establish themselves as Atl's finest MCs, the production is mellow gold and the overall vibe is just outstanding. Tracks like 'Two Dope Boys', 'ATLiens' and 'Wheelz of Steel' are among my favorite rap songs of all time. Air-tight flows and beats that make your head bob and your speakers purrr with bowel-obstructing basslines; this album is right up there with fellow mid-90s classics like Reasonable Doubt, Stakes is High, Beats Rhymes and Life and Labincalifornia. Don't sleep on this.... and when you're done congratulating yourself for (re)discovering this masterpiece jump forward a couple years and cop their almost-as-classic album Aquemini.
0143036742|5.0|Marina Lewycka appears to have scored a surprise hit with her debut novel with the unlikely title of \\"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\\" (SHOTU). Looking on the surface like some lightweight bit of fluff and not the most obvious choice of titles for the critics' list, SHOTU nevertheless made the Booker longlist last year and is still selling enough copies to remain on Britain's Top 10 bestsellers list. So what's the magic behind this sleeper's staying power ? You've got to read it to get it.      SHOTU proves that award winning books don't have to make heavy reading. A good book makes compelling reading if it succeeds in making an instant connection with the reader and SHOTU does exactly that ! It is comic and at the same time tragic, seemingly contradictory qualities that best describe the complexities of life and the unknowable mysteries of the human condition. Two sisters, Vera and Nadia, opposite in many ways and hostile to one another for reasons anyone growing up in families will be able to understand, put aside their differences to save their foolish ageing father - and their own inheritance - from the grasping hands of a voluptuous gold digger from Ukraine.  Can anyone ask for a more realistic premise for a big time domestic shoot-out ?      But what saves SHOTU from the melodrama of your average chick lit is that straightforward as the designs and motives of the grasping Valentina are with regard to her marriage to Nikolai the old professor, it is the moral ambuiguity of the entire situation, including the old man's right to a last stab at feeling alive (however foolish it may seem), the sisters' psychological and material self interests in their united show of loyalty to their deceased mother's memory, not to mention the defence of their own inheritance, etc etc, that continues to intrigue and wrestle with our conscience as we follow the unrelenting attempts of the sisters to inflict the mortal blow on the sham marriage of Valentina to their father.Issues relating to immigration, the plight of new settlers in a foreign country, the debasement of values and standards of those who have escaped the horrors of tyranny, etc are given a light handed treatment by Lewycka, whose clear and easy writing style is as deceptively simple as it is relevant and true.  The history of tractors figures in the story only in so far as it demonstrates man's ability to choose to use technology for either good or evil. Good or bad, life is a bit like that.     Marina Lewycka's prose has a lovely style that makes SHOTU a thoroughly delightful read. It'll make you laugh and cry and set you thinking. Even Valentina - the official villain of the piece - demands a little sympathy. Would we choose or act any differently in her situation ? One of the best reads from the critics' selection last year. I can't recommend it highly enough.
038551123X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book by a new author.  This is Lindsay's debut novel.  Yes, there are parts of the book where you can tell he's a new writer, but for the most part it's a good to great book.  I'm not going to write a plot summary.  You can get that from Amazon or numerous other reviewers.  I enjoyed the concept of a serial killer's viewpoint and trying to help the police with others.  Loved the plot twists and turns.  The secondary characters will need built up some.  This book is bloody and isn't for the faint of heart.  It's not a romance book and doesn't have that angle.  I think this is going to make a great series.  I can't wait to read his second book about Dexter.  I would highly recommend it to all my friends and to most readers.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|look people. this album is absolutely amazing. Why? because it will satisfy the tastes of the average blue collar, coors light drinking  redneck, to the saggy pants wearing, 40 oz drinking, hip hop R&B fan. The song are catchy, smooth, and meaningful. Is this man from our generation? What were his influences as a child? I need to know, john? If you read this, please tell me. I can't stop listening. I have so much respect for you as an artist, I can't really describe it, without sounding like a groupie. This is what music is all about. inspirational, timeless, and soulful. There is simply no album on the market that touches this at any level. The R&B influence is beautiful. Remember how marvin gaye made you feel? The temptations? Well add john mayer to the list. I implore anyone reading this to give this album a serious listen, and you too, will be amazed. Those who say they are disappointed are probably people who EXPECTED something, instead of LISTENING. Only a fool would call this anything but, LOVELY MUSIC. <br /> <br />Thank You JOHN................ from one music lover to another.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|King Kong is sitting on a cliff, staring out at the sea of humanity, the sunset glistening in his thoughful stare, looking as much a troubled soul as Ghandi contemplating humankind, while his tiny Fay Wray joins him at his side, in what seems a philosophical prayer to all of civilization. It is, at once, both a ridiculous scene and a touching one, a humanizing of the movie's greatest monster that's as homey as Andy Griffith casting a parental gaze over Mayberry while patting Opie on the head.<br /><br />What is missing in Kong's frantic confrontation with man on the streets of New York City, and what made the original 1933 film so horrific, is the panicked animal quality revealed in the eyes of the original Kong, as he searched high and low on the streets of the big city for anything resembling a jungle vine. He was the pet monkey gone violently berserk in a worst case scenario. Here, he's barely more frightening than the average New Yorker late for the subway.<br /><br />So we have a kinder, gentler Kong. The scares are reserved for the striking island scenes during the first half, that serve as a techno-wonder salutation to the fine work of the original film, and arrive, thankfully, after the melodramatic trite, cliched characters, and stale performances of the film's first 40 minutes.<br /><br />But I enjoyed the film as an entertaining tongue-in-cheek homage to early Hollywood and the original monster. The special effects and cinema work are a feast for the eyes. What this docile magilla-gorilla needs is a bad case of rabies.
B000H305U0|2.0|The problem that I've always had with Justin as a solo artist is that he relies way too much on beats in his music. Sure, it's catchy, but at some point it becomes annoying and repetitive. His image doesn't help either, it's becoming a cliche. I think he's way too comfortable with vocally imitating MJ and Prince. I mean to be honest, I don't think Justin is THAT talented, but i was expecting something cool and sexy out of this album, but it falls flat to just cliche beats and not much substance to make the album as a whole very interesting.
B00097DX3U|5.0|After fooling around with their sound on their first album, Audioslave break through with a sound of their own. While the first one sounded too much like Rage Against the Machine, this one mellows the sound a bit and comes up with something, if anything, more \\"grungy\\".  Though not completely, I wouldn't call it Soundgarden. It's kind of simple and really easy to get into, yet it's not boring. I can listen to it over and over again and not get tired of it. <br /> <br />On this album there are softer songs like \\"Heaven's Dead\\", \\"The Curse\\", and \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow\\"; but there are also harder ones like \\"Your Time Has Come\\" (which sounds a lot like a lesser known Metallica song called \\"Bad Seed\\"), \\"Drown me Slowly\\", and \\"Man or Animal\\". \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" has a melody that sounds almost hippie-ish and \\"#1 Zero\\" is probably the best song I've heard them play. Chris sounds amazing in this song, as he always does. <br /> <br />Tom spends less time making weird sounds and more time just doing some great guitar playing. On the last album, there wasn't really any time you could say \\"Man that was an awesome solo!\\" Here, although alot of the music is more mellow, there are some really hard heavy-metal style solos and the riffs are better too. <br /> <br />Also Brad's drumming is much more lively here, with more fills and three drum solos (okay, I'm not calling him Neil Peart, but it's a hell of alot better than that basic 1-2-3-4 click track drumming that plagued most of the first album). <br /> <br />Audioslave went on to release a more funk-influenced album after this but this stands as my favorite of the three and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys straight-out rock and roll and doesn't mind it being a little simple. <br /> <br />Audioslave on this album is: <br /> <br />Chris Cornell - Vocals <br />Tim Commerford - Bass <br />Brad Wilk - Drums <br />Tom Morello - Guitars
B00005221M|5.0|I do not know what the other viewers are talking about. I was very skeptical about te DVD until i got it on netflix and watched it. Its like LOTR, some added scenes and dialouge to enhance the film, but making it a little longer. There were no random scenes that looked out of place, there was more backstory and action which i enjoyed. I did like the monolouge at the end done by the father *i dont want to spell his name wrong* buy this DVD its good i promise...
6305922756|4.0|A seering exploration of life behind the glitz and glamour of rock and roll? Not quite, but it is an amusing mock-u-mentry on a fictitious band named Spinal Tap and the trials and tribulations on the concert road for a group long past its glory days.<br /><br />Released in '84 'This Is Spinal Tap' is a cult classic amongst those who are in a band, or have ever been in one. I on the other hand have never possessed any musical talent and therefore I'm not privy to the clever nuances and insightful jokes that populate this film, I can only take the word of those on the inside.<br /><br />Be that as it may, if you, like me, find yourself on the outside looking in give it a chance anyway. There's enough funny material, like the Stonghenge bit, for all of us to enjoy!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I first saw this when I was 19, in 1980 when Dawn was only a couple of years old, and I was catatonic all night!  I'm 45 now, and I STILL, at least once or twice a year, have Zombie nightmares!: usually I'm climbing a tree, or a roof, or even flying, and the zombies are reaching up and grabbing at me, and sometimes actually touch me!  I wake up gasping!  This movie is THAT scary!  I'm a Christian, so I know that it couldn't really ever happen, but it's still fun to play \\"What If?\\" !  I HATED the zombies in 2004's remake; I mean, get real, zombies can't run!! They're DEAD! The zombies in THIS movie are just what they should be-slow, stupid, mean & HUNGRY!!  And TERRIFYING!!! The black zombie at the beginning, EATS his wife's neck and arm, and it's SO realistic and horrifying-looking and sounding! YIKES!!That's the hardest scene to watch. Steven, toward the end, made the BEST zombie I've ever seen!!! The way he dragged his foot, and the way he instinctively remembered where the upstairs room was, and the way he gnawed at the wall, was both hilarious AND terrifying!! I really hated what happened to Roger; he was the second-best Zombie defense they had, but he let his cocky-ness get the best of him, and he paid dearly for it.  But it was cool, the way he really did try not to come back, just like he told Peter. You could see him trying not to sit up! Also I LOVED the elevator zombie trying to crawl in, the baseball-player zombie that fell in love with Fran, the Hari-krishna zombie-all of them, I give them all 1000-thumbs up!  Even the Smurfette-looking zombie in the makeup department!!  LOVE IT-LOVE IT-LOVE IT!!!!!! The theme song when it's going off is classic!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|To paraphrase a line from another well written show: I came late to the party of  Firefly/Serenity Verse.  Let's give me credit for finally seeing a true gem for what it is: proof that television doesn't have to be banal, can include new ideas, well rounded characters who actual evolve, stirring action sequences, a show that would be classified as comedy due to the stunning array of one liners and humor if so very much other stuff wasn't going on.  A recent sojurn to a Sf/F convention showed large numbers of fans in typical SF/F fashion costumed as characters buying tons of fan related items.  In typical Firefly/Serenity fashion though, these fans were also working on charity drives to assist others.  How many movies or TV shows evolve to this extent?  My suggestion is to go ahead and buy the movie along with the boxed set of the TV show at the same time, you'll want it because you will hate this 'Verse to end.  And buy an extra set, at some point you'll be compelled to share the show with others and you won't want to give up yours on the off chance it won't come back to you.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I don't know what more I could add that hasn't already been said.  I've been anticipating this album since I first heard TRY.  I gained new respect for John Mayer after that album and like many others, was no longer ashamed to admit that I was a fan.  Even though his earlier stuff was more pop infused, you couldn't deny his songwriting skills.  Nobody can lay down lyrics like he can.  That blending of his musical skill with his songwriting skills in this newest release has created such a beautiful thing.  I can't think of anything besides \\"loveliness\\" to describe it.  It hits your soul in so many places.  It took me a day to recover from my seven hours of listening pleasure.  I appreciate good music more than just about anything else and I'm so thrilled and excited that something this good has come along.  If you enjoy and appreciate quality music, not of the macaroni and cheese variety, you will really enjoy this album.  If you are addicted to junk food \\"music\\", you may be disappointed, because your pallet won't be able to handle the full measure of the flavor.
0792841344|5.0|I think that Phantasm was a big surprise hit back in '79 for different reasons than why it has endured as a cult movie to this day. <br /> <br />Sure, the special effects haven't aged as well as some, but they were remarkable for a low-budget movie made only two years after Star Wars came out.  At the time, Phantasm did not come across as a low budget movie at all and I think it shocked everybody.  It's taken decades and many technical developments in SFX along the way to finally make this movie's technical limitations more glaringly obvious.  At the time?  There wasn't a 12-year old in the country who didn't think it was impressive. <br /> <br />Phantasm was bizarre enough and had enough shock moments to scare and thrill young viewers, and the killer silver balls were such a unique cinematic experience that nobody else has even tried to emulate them in a similar horror film.  <br /> <br />But while Coscarelli was able to brilliantly evoke and convey his unique nightmare vision of the strange tall man, the mysterious silver balls, and grave-robbing interdimensional evil cloaked dwarves, what makes this film endure is what I believe is the human element. <br /> <br />As opposed to the shallow, vapid, teen slasher flicks to follow it, Phantasm's characters are allowed to develop into involving, three dimensional people.  I believe that is what gives this movie some legs, and what has allowed for relevant Phantasm sequels (ii- iv).  There is a unique, profound sadness in Mike Pearson's compulsive need to follow his big brother around after the deaths of both of their parents.  And in the end, there is an even deeper sadness when the audience realizes that his big brother Jody has been dead all along as well.  The characters are allowed to show and feel emotional depth-- sorrow, fear, anger, frustration.  They aren't cardboard props to be slashed by the villain.  They're intrepid, resourceful, and you can't help but like them and relate to them... especially when they're just sittin' on the porch strummin' the guitar and singing some tunes. <br /> <br />Phantasm's surrealness is only reinforced when it is made the backdrop of such normal human characters and behavior.  Otherwise, cloaked dark dwarves and flying silver balls would seem quite random and stupid if put in the context of your typical teen slasher flick (another sorority/campfire bimbofest, anyone?).  This is where most of the low-budget cookie-cutter horror films fail nowadays.
B000050HTO|5.0|I'm new to Bob Dylan's music and I must say I really loved this cd. I was unsure about listening to it since I wasn't all that enamoured with Dylan's voice but when you listen to music it just clicks into place. Dylan is a master at lyrics and mood. Each song has a unique mood or message that he conveys in what seems like an effortless manner. I fell in love with some of his songs of heartbreak and change.<br /><br />This compilation is broken into two disks. disk one covers music originally recorded from 1962-1967 and disk two covers music originally recorded from 1969-1999. Bob Dylan life time of music is rather prolific so creating a compilation of his music into two disks must have been a huge undertaking but from a novice Dylan fan I think a great job was done.<br /><br />I can say with out a doubt that disk one, which covers `62-67, is my favorite from the two although I loved both but I find myself listening to disk one over and over. I have been very moved by his deep emotion on unrealized love with \\"Don't think twice, It's all Right\\" and his reflection on every day struggles with \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\". So many of the songs on the first disc most people have heard recorded by other artists like \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", and \\"Quinn The Eskimo\\" which speaks to his wonderful writing and appeal to other musical artists.<br /><br />Disk two brought more great songs but they have a different feel to them, some how more impassioned and sensual with a touch of humility on life. You see the sensual side in \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" and impassioned views on justice with \\"Hurricane\\". There is even a little sadness in the second disc, you have to wonder how difficult the 1970's were for Dylan to be able to write so many songs that echoed in the hearts of others. Maybe that's why I like disc one.....less sad. I have to give a big shout out for songs like \\"I Shall be Released\\", \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\", and \\"Jokerman\\".<br /><br />As I said before, I'm new to Bob Dylan's music but I can also say I am now a huge fan. I'd also like to mention the song \\"Not Dark Yet\\" from the second disc, it speaks of a soulful reflective Bob Dylan that I find quite nice.<br /><br />Great writing, great feeling, great music.<br /><br />girldiver:)I'm new to Bob Dylan's music but I can also say I am now a huge fan.

0618477942|5.0|You can't judge a book... but the dust jacket of this one is terrific. The pleasant surprises start as soon as you unwrap the Amazon packaging.<br /><br />For a comic book autobiography these images, story and one-liners stick. Almost daily I think of an aspect such as mother telling daughter about her father from an adult's perspective or the unexpected high school mutual admiration for father's and daughter's stimulated minds, or brother and sister who can't stop grinning at their father's funeral. I have pondered whether it was suicide but will accept the author's inclinations on that one.<br /><br />A conversation in a car, a classroom full of bored students, toddlers on a stairway. The character graphics seem likely at every age. There is a precision that Dad would have approved of. The photo on the back cover is of Bechdel but could have been her father, according to the drawings.<br /><br />I never sought out Bechdel's comic strip, Dykes to Watch Out for. I read it if I see it incidentally. When you have lived a similar life, the house full of women, the kids, the collectives, it doesn't seem interesting or funny enough, but Fun House is both, maybe because my childhood wasn't like Bechdel's. We definitely didn't run a funeral home and my father wasn't gay.<br /><br />My mother glanced through the drawings, seemed to enjoy the book, then hit a sex picture and that was that. Too bad. She would have liked it had she read the whole thing.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I've been an Iron Maiden fan since I was 12 (Piece of Mind). This album is simply awesome, and a perfect example of the evolution of heavy metal. With all the whiny crap that passes as \\"rock\\" for the last decade, it's great to know there are still musicians left that play real metal. This is one of those albums you can put in your player, press \\"Play\\", and let it go beginning to end. There's no hunting for the \\"good songs\\", they're all good.
1594830835|2.0|This was my first Baldacci audiobook.  It seems I picked poorly.  I agree with the other reviews that bring up the unbeliveability of the plot, but that was not the worst thing about this book.  There were way too many conversations had by characters that were incongruous.  When you find yourself saying, \\"why are these guys talking about this, it makes no sense\\", then there is trouble.  Most of these conversations were to bring background (and i guess Baldacci was going for depth in his characters) but were just boring.  Why would the director of a national spy agency and his right hand man have a conversation about \\"hey, remember when we had all this trouble getting all the spy databases together?\\"  It's like they are reminiscing about old times in a part of the story when they should be talking seriously.  blah blah blah.  One could be overlooked, but there are many conversations in this story that could be left out and the book would be better.  Maybe the abridged version is better :)
0446615625|1.0|Wanting something imaginative, exciting, and diverting I picked up \\"The Camel Club\\" at my local bookstore and decided to give it and David Baldacci a try. A situation of a group of fairly old guys, each with unique talents and life experiences, banding together to protect the nation seemed appealing with many possibilities. I agree with many reviewers that the plot is impossibly far-fetched with a political agenda (as is the case with most books of this genre). However, there is no reason why these aspects should get in the way of an enjoyable and mind-bending story. Unfortunately, what I got was a disjointed, confusing, and often boring plot line with undeveloped characters and relationships. Many times, because of boredom, I considered not finishing \\"The Camel Club,\\" but I did push on and made it to the end. I need not have bothered. The only recommendation I can make is to pick a different book from the shelf!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I am a big fan of John Mayer and when I heard this album for the first time at a website which was broastcasting it...I was not very impressed initially but like people said, it grows on you. This album is not for the pop radio culture. To be honest, I liked most of the songs but not all in this album but songs like Gravity, Stop this Train and Dreaming with a Broken Song easily elevate it to 5 star status. His lyrics and music is so beautiful that it touches you deep inside like no other artist i have heard in the recent times. Please go and buy this album if you want to listen to quality music far better than the average crap u get.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|It just doesn't get any simpler, or any better, than this.<br /><br />\\"Magic Potion\\" features the same short list of ingredients that made The Black Keys great--only now everything's blended toghether even more perfectly. Two guys--guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach and drummer Pat Carney. Timeless blues songs about the timeless things: love, lust, desire, duplicity, troubles both simple and insurmountable. Auerbach's perfect blues voice, with just the right amount of weariness and longing. Just the right amount of drumming from Carney. And swirling throughought, Auerbach's great electric guitar crunching through monster blues riffs and spreading out into long lonely arcs of electrified ache.<br /><br />On paper, the Black Keys sound like something dreamed up by record company executives trying to copy The White Stripes. Two people? Check. From a Rust Belt town? Check. Playing garage-y blues? Check. A name with a color in it? Check.<br /><br />It sounds like something that's been done before. And it has. And yet the music's so good and simple and timeless and catchy that you can't help but love it anyway--this is the kind of music you hear just once and say, \\"Wow--who is this?\\" so you can pick up your own copy at your earliest convenience, if not sooner. The songs are every bit as good, and perhaps even more consistent, than those on 2004's \\"Rubber Factory.\\" And there's some killer lyrics here, to boot. \\"I don't wanna go to hell, but if I do, it'll be cause of you,\\" Auerbach growls on \\"Strange Desire,\\" and it's hard to think of a simpler, fresher, or more authentically blues-y lyric. The band's website says this album's about \\"getting their signature sound down to a science,\\" and that sounds about right. It's a shame more musicians can make timeless music so effortlessly--there's plenty of bands out there with three times as many people that don't sound half as good.
B000003S0F|5.0|This is a jewel in the King Crimson catalog, make no mistake.  It's a bit more subdued and introspective than other KC offerings, but it is outstanding.  Definitely a good addition to your cd collection.
B000GFLE86|5.0|Ever since Careless Love was released I have been looking forward to another CD from Madeleine.  And this one almost matches the last - maybe I am not quite as excited because I didn't experience the \\"wow\\" factor that I did with Careless Love - when her sound was brand new to me.  I think the best cuts are the 4 that Madeleine co-wrote with others, and I really wish her next CD would be all her own creations. Thank you, Madeleine.
B000H305U0|5.0|i got this CD and now i cant put it down. while sometracks are not as memorably as others. the cd is definately a winner (excuse typos). some of the best songs are my love (with TI) and another song all over again. &lt;----thats a great make up song..or better yet a hopefull song. the ballads are smooth i just think that he cursed to much and that might hurt his sales. who want to buy there kids a cd with a explicit content logo on it.
B000FA57RG|3.0|This documentary was ok, but not the best. I prefer TRuth or DAre more. Here we get introduced to Madonna's 2 kids Lola and Rocco and Guy Ritchie. This DVD is very spiritial as she does talk about Kaballah and does brings up politics. Michael Moore also has a cameo. She talks to a lot of her dancers and we see a more mature side of MAdonna as opposed to Truth or DAre. I recommend it if you are interested in politics and Kaballah. The highlights are of course the show and the music but either than that it drags by really slowly.
B00003CXTG|3.0|I'm not sure what would have made this movie better.  Maybe less about the relationships and more about the battle, I suppose.  There just wasn't enough action for me.  It was all at the end.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|As if Mr. Zimmerman needed yet again another masterpiece to solidify his place as THE most important musical figure of the last century along comes Modern Times. I won't go song by song in this review, they all by themselves are far and away better than anything on the current bleak barren landscape of forgettable garbage that is passed off as art these days. In the spirit of the masterpiece closer 'Aint Talking\\" which takes it's place along side such breathtaking pieces of brillance like \\"Every Grain of Sand\\" and \\"A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall\\"I'll just let what you already presumbly know about the man do the talking. I will say that this cd has not left my player in the two or so weeks I have had it. I had the privilige of seeing Bob and his incredible band on the 27th of August in Manchester,N.H, they didn't perform any of the new cd at the show but it has just continued the sheer ecstasy of that night and for that I wish I could give a personal thanks to Bob for his inspiration to me spiritually, in my own artistic endeavours and for allowing me a glimpse into his dreams and visions. Elvis,Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, my personal favorites and biggest artistic influences. Here's to prayerfully and hopefully many more productive years to the last of the old guard of true American Musical greatness. Oh, by the way, you need this cd, the odyssey of Bringing it All Back Home continues on into the 21'st Century.
B000HF7PEC|3.0|This isn't a review of the actual film (there are plenty of reviews for that).  I just wanted to give people an idea of what they're buying with this edition so as to avoid any potential disappointment.  The following is an opinionated description of the contents: <br /> <br />The DVD package itself is identical to the two-disc widescreen special edition. Thumbs up. <br /> <br />The lenticular slipcase has three modes (red circle-V, circle-V in flames, movie poster). The lenticular part is pretty cool.  However, the dimensions of the slipcase are not ideal.  Both the DVD case and the book must be contained inside the slip case to ensure a snug fit and to avoid colapsing the slip case.  Not so great. <br /> <br />However, the real sore spot for me is the inclusion of the \\"64-page 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel\\".  It's not the complete graphic novel, but only the first half or so  (spoiler: it ends when V appears in the coroner's / Larkhill doctor's bedroom). This was no mistake since the last page of the books states \\"to be continued in the 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel\\". Thus, while the marketing blurb is not an outright lie (had I done my homework, I would have known there was no way the graphic novel would fit in 64 pages, and would have thus avoided disappointment), the marketing is indeed misleading. Stating \\"Includes the first half of the 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel scaled to the size of a DVD case\\" would be much more accurate. <br /> <br />I would suggest not going out of your way or spending extra money for this edition over the two-disc special edition, unless you're out to collect an abridged version of the graphic novel. If you're interested in the graphic novel proper, I'm sure you'll know where to start your search. <br /> <br />Cheers, and I hope this helps.
B000002LOE|5.0|'Out of Time,' but certainly not out of talent, R.E.M. reinvented themselves in sound and outlook like never before. The double images of a watershed on the album's cover can't fail to make its point: They will never be the same. To accentuate their makeover, the back photo shows the group in black, mourning their old image. (It is an update to the Beatles at their own funeral on the cover of 'Sgt. Pepper'.) Mike Mills has an all-knowing smirk, and Michael Stipe's arms are raised to embrace the horizon like the tragic characters in Joyce Carol Oates' story, \\"Where Are You Going? Where Have You Been?\\" They definitely go to new destinations from here on out. The desperation, angst, and appeals made for divine and human love seemingly gone wrong are brilliantly presented on this their, er..., watershed...album.    On 'Out of Time' the sky's the limit. They start with a loose and skillful rap \\"Radio Song\\" with scathing lines addressed to the aggrieved beloved. The song also skillfully parodies \\"Pop Song '89,\\" which is itself a fun-filled mockery of pop music. Then, their anguished anthem \\"Losing My Religion\\" serenades the listener even in the midst of despair. Peter's expert mandolin playing and the alternative \\"wall of sound\\" they created shot this song nearest the top spot of any R.E.M. single. (Sour relationships and the alienation of stardom have shaken their faith.)    The angry despair of unrequited love continues even though the potpourri of music embellishes it in many different ways. \\"Low\\" is brilliant, even with its Velvet Underground influence. The desperation is stark and superbly presented. \\"Near Will Heaven\\" is sarcastic and innocuous at the same time. Sounding like a pop choir, the lyrics celebrate innocense and its overthrow in the same breath. Then, there is the pensiveness presented in the fine instrumental \\"Endgame\\". (As Tom Petty sang, \\"Waiting is the hardest part.\\")    The second half of the C.D. trumps the first. \\"Shiny Happy People\\" has the same effect as \\"Near Wild Heaven,\\" except it is looser and more exhiliarating. The bitterness is apparent, but R.E.M. sings to cheer themselves up. (The video, especially Bill Berry's appearance, tells it all.) \\"Half a World Away\\" continues the pensiveness with a harpsicord-like accompaniment and a lyrical assertiveness that lets us know that love is more important than politics. (Not resisting comparisons, U2 demonstrated this by ending 'Rattle and Hum,' the movie and the C.D., with \\"All I Want Is You\\".) Then, \\"Texarkana,\\" is arguably--yes, subjectively, too--the album's best song. With able delivery and finesse shown like on \\"World Leader Pretend,\\" 'Green''s best song, \\"Texarkana\\" is a symphonic psalm that builds up to a crescendo, sung with bitter sarcasm by Mike Mills with fine back-up vocals by Stipe. If this weren't enough, \\"Country Feedback\\" is a brilliant piece of country alternative, complete with reverberation that evokes all the blistering heartache present. Even Michael Stipe's vocals trail off, too emotional to prevent a pause. After all this variety and brilliance, the album ends with a hopeful, exhiliarating, but desperate appeal. \\"Me in Honey\\" treats alternative like big band music with a gallop.     The energy and appeal of the music on 'Out of Time' is stunning. Certainly, the inspiration is exceptional, but the quality of musicianship, lyrics, and variety of forms presented is stunning and perfectionistic, especially when they loosen up their shirtsleeves like never before.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Saw an \\"EW\\" article a few weeks ago where Ray LaMontagne mentioned that Solsbury Hill was one of those songs \\"every songwriter wishes they had written\\". I hadn't heard of Ray before that, but giving those kind of props to Peter Gabriel inspired me to order Till the Sun Turns Black. As I sit here listening to \\"Within You\\" over and over, I'm once again reminded how deeply I miss John Lennon, and how much the world needs John to \\"Be Here Now\\". I love the groove of \\"You Can Bring Me Flowers\\" and the delicate brass tastefully playing in the song's back yard keep me smiling as I tap my right foot. Yep, Ray, by next week, I'll have added \\"Trouble\\" to my collection. This is an absolute killer of a CD.
B000GIWS7E|3.0|Ilove this band, but I have to say that they did no good job on this dvd..the sound quality sucks..you cant hear the singer, the drum sounds like a cheap kit, and the bass is missing....what a shame for this extraordinary band..they dont deserve this..I have live at the budokan, scenes from ny and this one..and this is the worst...
B000002A3T|5.0|....DSOTM is almost impossible to compare with anything, it's such an iconic recording.  At least I can't be very objective about it....  As a tremendous fan of most all Floyd since that record, I can honestly say Division Bell is  my favorite. Less cynical than the rest of them (with a couple of tracks as very notable exceptions!!)  <br /> <br />The whole record is magnificent, but I would spotlight these tracks:   <br /> <br />What Do You Want From Me - a classically brutal  recipe of backbeated Floyd orchestration, tough-soundin' black chicks, all of it swirling up into a chorus of acid psychedelia. He's got that rocket-fizzling-across-the-sky guitar tone on this one.  <br /> <br />Poles Apart - beautiful tune, great demented interlude segues perfectly back into the song <br /> <br />Take It Back - irresistible hook theme on the saw that recurs elswhere in the record.  Staccato guitar ostinato similar to Run Like Hell, and I really enjoy Gimour's singing of the verses. <br /> <br />High Hopes - well, this could be the darkest thing ever conceived and recorded. Creepy beyond belief, and a chorus that is fed to you like sugar-laced cyanide. Gilmour's best slide solo on this, and simply a monstrous track that would make any  <br />album a must-have. <br /> <br />Lost For Words - for me, Gilmour's best acoustic work - another one of his wonderful solo of statements, made with masterful phrasing and economy. Kind of a big western guitar sound, fantastic lyric, appropriate interlude, killer outro...not to mention the \\"story\\" of it.    <br /> <br />A Great Day For Freedom - This track has been lauded nearly enough here....the verses gently lead you up to the precipice of the solo section, where one steps off into time suspended.  It's not a matter of whether or not it's Gilmour's best solo ever, it's a matter or whether or not it's the most heartwrenching rock guitar solo EVER.  It all happens over only two chords, but for me, this playing is his finest moment, and thetone is glorious.   <br />
B000AP04FG|2.0|Ah, true Love.  Dinner by candlelight.  Holding hands in the moonlight.  Snapping a new clip on your Glock while your significant other sprays you with semi-automatic love missiles.<br /><br />I appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon, yet MR. & MRS. SMITH annoys more than it entertains.  True, there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut--a couple who, unbeknownst to one another, are professional assassins (just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train).  Add to that the erotic chemistry between Brad and Angelina; my eyebrows are still singed after watching them.  But all the sexiness and over-the-top, lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of Pitt's detached smirk and Jolie's constant flirtation with wackiness.  As the fighting (boy, is there fighting) escalates, I was suddenly asking myself, \\"Wouldn't it be great if they popped each other off?\\"<br /><br />Maybe in the sequel.<br /><br />While we're at it, would someone please feed Angelina a steak, mashed potatos. . .something?  Nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim, but come on, lose the East Africa look.  In the long run, MR. & MRS. SMITH's biggest problem was the fact Vince Vaughn didn't appear enough.  At least he gets paid to be annoying.<br /><br />--D. Mikels
B000002U82|5.0|I remember first time I put my LP on pick up and started listen   to this album, it moved me to tears. It always amazes me the  perfect combination of awesome, superb music, with best lyrics  ever.  \\"Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain  You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today  And then one day you find ten years have got behind you  No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.\\"    There wasn't anyone in this whole world that could not by that  time have noticed the powerfull appeal of this lyrics.   \\"Time\\" in my opinion is the best piece of music ever composed  and played and put on the tape ever. David Gilmour solo in the   middle section of \\"Time\\", is the most sensitive, deep, perfect  guitar solo i've listened during all of my life. On the end of  time you can listen a beautiful piece called \\"Breathe Reprise\\":  \\"Home , Home again  I like to be here when I can  When I come home cold and tired  It's good to warm my bones beside the fire  Far Away across the field   The tolling of the iron bell  Calls the faithful to their knees  To hear the softly spoken magic spells\\"    When you think, gee, it starts a sequence of chords on piano  played by Richard Wright of such a beauty atmosphere I can't  not describe it with words, and suddenly Clare Torry's spectacular female vocals in conjunction with Wright's piano  move even the most insensible men in this world to tears.  Really, you've got to believe, when first side ends you are  convinced by a notion of had listen something so pretty superior  that you are proud of yourself of being contemporary of this brilliants English guys.  If it wasn't enough, it starts side B, with \\"Money\\", with a  well known cynical point of view of Roger Waters about the  importance world gives to money, and how it can change radically  a man to another one, with no value in terms of human beings  perspective. Musically talking this song deserves to be in a  Pink Floyd album, it's an ultimate single.    \\"Us, and them   And after all we're only ordinary men\\"    Roger Waters view of life and existence agrees completely with  the way I see the same matters. Listen to this beautiful song  and pay attention in the Waters's lyrics, it's a perfect pair.    \\"Brain Damage\\"  \\"The lunatic is on the grass  The lunatic is on the grass  Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs  Got to keep the loonies on the path\\"    Waters starts with the lunatic on the grass and finishes with  him inside his head.    \\"And if the clouds bursts, thunder in your ear  You shout and no one seems to hear  And if the band your're in starts playing different tunes  I'll see you on the dark side of the moon\\"    The last verses show that Roger was dealing with a beggining of some problems with the band, and he wanted exorcize it.    If you people read my review of \\"Atom heart mother\\" you'll  all notice that I don't give five stars to All Pink Floyd  Albums.  ButI know,and I'm sure Pink Floyd is the best popular group ever,  \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the most impressive and moving  and complete, and deserving to call an art \\"opus\\" indeed, cohesive, intense, brilliant, lyrically insuperable, unique  dense, gentle, musically superb...  Now I'm Forty one years old man, and garduated in Mechanical  Engineering with an Msc started. By that time I was twelve, but  once I put my vynil or my SACD ON TO PLAY and I have the same  experience I had for the first time really. It's such a superb  experience and I thank to those intelligent Calcasians English  Middleclass men that created this.    Thank you:  Roger Waters  David Gilmour  Richard Wright  Nick Mason...     It's a superp work of Art.  Thank you very much indeed.     To me, this is a ten stars record, maybe a hundred or more.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|The Beast is back...with a vengeance. Only this time he's got a bit of a sensitive side.    I think we can all agree Maiden's ultimate track list includes, but is not limited to, The Number of the Beast; Hallowed Be Thy Name; Revelations; The Trooper; Aces High; 2 Minutes to Midnight; and Paschendale.    Gentlemen, grab your pencils. Brighter than a Thousand Suns; The Longest Day; Out of the Shadows; and For the Greater Good of God have officially been added to that list. A Matter of Life and Death is incredibly sweet, and, in my opinion, tops every other album ever recorded - period. All of this coming from an American Pearl Jam type.    A partial list of AMOLAD accolades includes:   1. One of the best examples of raw guitar use, not unlike that of Powerslave's 2 Minutes to Midnight, is found in The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg. Extra kudos to Gers.  2. Possibly the greatest execution of extended play time post-Powerslave's Rime of the Ancient Mariner might well be credited to For the Greater Good of God.  3. Arguably one of Dickinson's strongest vocal performances since Piece of Mind's Revelations is on full display in the same, For the Greater Good of God. Further to the point, Harris' masterful penmanship and crisp undertones deserve very special mention.     4. Without question, AMOLAD's battle epic The Longest Day ranks among Maiden's most brilliant; at parity to Smith's splendid retelling of Paschendale. Smith, on the subject - while not only sounding more amazing than ever -, takes home the Best Makeover Award.      5. Excepting the band's minor loss of synchronization on the album's third track, Brighter than a Thousand Suns, McBrain's leadership and percussion are really outstanding - never has he appeared finer in form.  666. Davey's mesmerizing musicianship is out of this world. In a word or two...true perfection.    This album is an absolute must-have.    J~
0679746048|5.0|i really liked this book.  where \\"prozac nation\\" is long, wordy and full of drama, \\"girl interrupted\\" is short and less full of drama.  the author is \\"crazy\\" yet seems pretty normal.  she writes about her experience of going to a mental institution and making friends with all the crazy people.  learning about these people is very interesting.  it makes them seem more human, and perhaps more \\"normal.\\"
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I am watching the DVD as I write this review.  I am not going to critique what everyone else has written. Emily Rossum is exquisite and the rest of the cast is exceptional. <br /> <br />What I feel from my heart is the heartbreaking life of the Phantom and what he went through.  Living in the bowels of the Paris Opera House in a sewer.  All he wanted was to be loved.  Isn't what we all want in life, to be loved and to be cared for? <br /> <br />A beautiful movie, and one to think about.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Where are the RESTORED AND UNRAPED ORIGINAL ANAMORPHIC versions in STANDARD DVD RESOLUTION ?
B00005ATQD|5.0|This movie unfolds so wonderfully before our eyes that it renews our faith in the possibilities of cinema again. Stanley Kubrick, in his final turn as director, takes us on a journey so fascinating that it is difficult to recognize is as our own mundane world. To see life through Kubrick's eyes must have been a thing of wonder. In true Kubrick form, he presents a film, in this case a thrilling drama, filled with such quirky, hysterical characters that we laugh at moments that should not warrant laughter. It is hilarious when the father of a young teenage girl catches her half naked with Dr. Harford and subsequently threatens to kill him. Such was Kubrick's sardonic sense of humor. He also knew how to instill a sense of dread and he uses that to full effect in this film. While we tag along with Dr. Harford (Tom Cruise) as he plunges into his odyssey through the night, we get the feeling that we are more worried than he is about his predicaments. You will be on the edge of your seat until the very end and some scenes will have you cringing or peeking through your fingers at the screen. An emphatic piano score adds to the effectiveness and mounting tension. Perhaps most of all, it is the sign of a great director that he can employ a celebrity such as Tom Cruise and make you think more about the director than the actor. Everything about this movie, from the pacing and pausing to the performances and \\"feel,\\" says \\"Kubrick.\\" For many of us, this says a great deal.
140003180X|5.0|In Precious Ramotswe, the proprietor of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, we find the charmed common sense of Africa. She is fond of manners and good company. When her adopted orphans misbehave, she seeks advice. When a sexist competitor brails her detective agency, she treats competition as an indispensable part of running a successful business. When a remorseful client asks for help, she shows empathy. When a wronged woman demands answers, she displays discretion. She is the center of her small world.<br /><br />The first sentence captures the spirit of the book: \\"I must remember, thought Mma Ramotswe, how fortunate I am in this life\\". Indeed, we are fortunate to read about Precious Ramotswe. Delightful.
B000056N8X|1.0|Could this possibly be the worst movie ever? First off, the swordplay in highlander is generally laughable, but that speaks for 99% of all such films that rely on \\"hollywood showboating and theatrical swordsmanship\\" rather than real historical techniques. That bieng said I won't hold that against this thing that some say passes for a movie. Secondly, Is it really a movie or just a really long episode of the crappy tv series by the same name.  Thirdly anything with that sissy other MacLeod from the tv series should not be viewed by anyone. The crappy second Highlander movie was far far far better than this trash and that says a lot.
1577314808|5.0|I believe this is the most ground breaking book, to date, on the transmutation of the ego (humankinds group mental disease).   <br /> <br />This is the book that mankind has been waiting for, but until this time had not yet been ready for.  This is \\"THE BOOK\\" on taking back your power from the ego. It is about reclaiming your divine self.  It is about finding the beauty of unity consciousness.  It is about learning to live and love freely in the only moment, the present moment.  This book might not resonate with everyone because not everyone is ready to attempt to go face to face with thier ego.  It takes a brave person to look at oneself and ones thoughts honestly.  There are also people that are simply not going to be able to digest this infomation because of the way their mind is structured.  This does not make them any less of a person than the next.  Just not someone who is ready for this book.  But for those who are ready, I believe this book has the potential to literally tranform a person, this is the book that can change you.  I admire Eckart Tolle more than any other spiritual teacher for his ability to cut through the human mind and it's assosiated tricks and pitfalls.   <br /> <br />I have owned this book for a couple years now.  Every time reread this book it is like I am reading it again for the first time. The information is still fresh and new.  To adress some of the other reviewers problem with repetition: I found the repetition in this book to be absolutely neccesary for me to digest this information completely.  While the concepts are extremely well described and palpable, they can be slippery when trying to remember them in full detail (obviously the work of the ego trying to forget the informaition).  This is why Tolle used repetition.  Becasue he understands how the human mind works.  <br /> <br />I am giving this book 5 stars because it has been the most powerful spiritual book I have ever read, and I have read and own hundreds of spiritual books.  It gives you a chance to look inside your mind from a new perspective and learn what is true and what is false. It teaches you how to identify and then overcome the negative and repetitive thinking habbits of the ego. (The thougts that previously seemed unshakeable or unavoidable)  This book might just wake you up out of a bad dream.  It might just make you a trully conscious being.
B00006HAZG|3.0|If the BBC can devote 26 episodes to the Forsyte Saga (an excellent movie), surely they can devote 12 episodes to the greatest novel in the English language.  Or to put it another way, if the BBC can devote five hours to an inferior novel like \\"The Buccaneers\\", surely they can devote twice that number to David Copperfield.      The 1974 version of the book is 5 hours long, the longest version so far.  It includes all the important events of the novel, but only touches on these events and the many characters and does not have time to make the events as effective as they could be.  The script is creditable except a few times where they ducked a dramatic scene, breaking before and coming in afterward, including the scene which Tolstoy called the greatest in all of world literature--the storm at sea.  It is also a low budget film.      The casting is inferior with weak performances of almost all the actors (the exceptions being Anthony Andrews as Steerforth, the actress who played Aunt Betsy and the actor who played Heap, who gave us the best Uriah of any of the movie versions).  Outstanding examples of bad casting were (1) David's mother, who should have been young and dainty instead of 40 and rugged, and (2) Dora, who should have been 16 and petite instead of late 30s and tall and sturdy.  Also, the actor played Macawber too seriously without the touch of comic absurdity which the book has and which the part required.  The actor who played the grown-up David did not look half so bad as the picture on the cover and played his part adequately.      The 1935 version with its stark black and white resembles the Cruikshank drawings in the book, and many of the performances are definitive: Freddy Bartholomew as young David, Edna Mae Oliver as Aunt Betsy, Basil Rathbone as Murdstone, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Peggoty, as well as the people who played David's mother, little Emily, and most of the minor characters.  It is an effective and indelible movie, marred only by having to leave so much out (2 hours 10 minutes) and by the horrendously inappropriate casting of W.C. Fields as Macawber (the most laconic actor in the movies to play the most loquacious character in all literature?!)  His laboring to get the words out is painful to watch.  The director, George Cukor, wanted Charles Laughton.  Louis B. Mayer overruled him.  But the filmmaker knew how to make movies, and the screenwriter knew how to write screenplays.  The same cannot be said for the other film versions.      The 1970 version is a joke.  Some smart-aleck screenwriter thought it would be clever to chop the story up into bits, toss them in the air, pick them up randomly and show them to the audience.  All the moving events are thus rendered totally ineffective.  This version is useful only as a lesson in how to ruin a great story.      The 1999 version is only three hours long and has more elaborate sets, some location shooting, and background music, but suffers from poor or inappropriate casting.  Maggie Smith chose to play Aunt Betsy as a straight serious role, depriving the character of the comic touches which make Aunt Betsy such a cherished character.  Bob Hoskins' performance bears no relation to Macawber, thus depriving us of one of the most colorful characters in all literature.  Incredibly, the actor chosen to play Murdstone looks almost identical to Hoskins!  Imelda Staunton portrays Mrs. Macawber very well, and the boy does well enough as young David, but the rest of the cast is lamentable.  And the omission of Traddles is a loss.  The script is hit and miss.  But the most serious problems are the introduction of a narrator who is constantly narrating and keeping the audience at one remove from the events, and the actor who played the grown-up David.  He constantly smiled and smirked, sometimes even in the tragic scenes.  He seemed to have no other facial expression.      Bottom line: If you can only afford one version, the 1974 version is your best bet.  Alas.
B00005JP01|5.0|This movie is pure pop garbage. The acting is sub-par, the portrayal of Japanese youth is based completely on American high schoolers' stereotypes, and the story is probably one of the LEAST developed in any film, in any country, EVER.<br /><br />That being said, you probably already knew that! If you can get past the quality factor, this movie is pretty rad! FF:TD light covers a lot of bases, if poorly: drift racing, single moms, military brats, J-hoes, the Yakuza, and Japanese-American cross-cultural relations. The action is pretty sweet, and the girls are SMOKIN'. I don't know too much about cars, so the import racer jargon is wasted on me, but um... I guess it sounds like Bow Wow knows what he's talking about.<br /><br />The one credit I do give to this film is on the subject of underprivileged teenage boys finding something constructive to build self-confidence with. Our hero has no friends, a lot of enemies, southern draw, detached father, and promiscuous mother, yet he's still able to keep his head up without selling dank or drinking himself to death. A modern-day blue-collar role model if I've ever seen one.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I bought this album for my wife the day it was released.  She's a huge Mayer fan.  I've listened to his previous records and I like them but this one I LOVE.  This is the most soulful record he's done.  His R&B and Blues influences show big time !  If you're looking for the perfect \\"Chill Out\\" album for the fall season....pick this one up.  I love \\"Gravity\\"  and the Hendrix remake \\"Bold As Love\\".  \\"Waiting On The World To Change\\"  is a monster.  I'm a fan for life now !
0307346609|1.0|At last, a book for those who feel that the living dead rising from the grave to devour and destroy the living will, obviously, usher in an era of leftist-progressive utopia. <br /> <br />No, really.  Zombies attacking world-wide would obviously solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem by producing a viable two state solution, right?  I think we could all see that one coming from a few miles out.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg as the world degenerates into a non-stop fit of inexplicable, unrealistic and (in the face of a zombie rising) just plain silly behavior. <br /> <br />World War Z consistently derails itself by losing focus on the issue at hand to go off on snide political asides, both large and small.   <br /> <br />As another reviewer already noted, we are told that the \\"last brushfire war\\" (for which, read:  Iraq) left the US too war weary to do anything but roll over and play dead when the undead hopped up intent on brain eating.  We're also told that the military could not fill its ranks because too many veterans were bitter about having to serve in said brushfire war (never mind the US military actually having little problem meeting recruiting goals) -- and are somehow given to understand that a draft would not be instituted in any case with a massive rising of the undead. <br /> <br />But, gentle reader, have no fear!  In the power vaccuum of poor war weary America steps the United Nations.  Ironic, for an organization whose main claim to fame has been enabling genocide in places like Rwanda, the Sudan, and the Balkans, we are given to understand that the UN successfully leads the charge to fend off the zombie hordes. <br /> <br />In summary, this book is twenty dollars and several hours of my life I'm never going to get back.  Apparently for readers who have not suffered enough in the reading, expect a big budget movie version sometime soon (Hollywood, of course, apparently loves this thing) to deprive you of another couple hours of your life. <br /> <br />Grade -- F.  Really, if you are thinking about reading this book, save yourself the pain and just go watch Romero movies or something.  Certainly this book is not a fitting follow up to the author's previous (and entertaining) Zombie Survival Guide.

B000FQJAIW|3.0|We are given 2-DVD releases where the films in the much sought-after original 1977/83 STAR WARS Trilogy are relegated to the status of \\"bonus discs,\\" a remarkably cynical move even for Lucas and Fox, who know full well that very few people actually want the dreadful 1997/2004 revisions that have been around on DVD for two years. These \\"bonus discs\\" are largely non-cleaned-up, low-definition, non-anamorphic transfers based on the 1993 laser discs. The picture is actually not bad, all things considered--better, in fact, than any other issuance of the originals (which admittedly appeared in media far inferior to the DVD); but with a little effort, they could have been so much better--especially for folks with 16x9 TVs. The 2.0 sound is more than adequate--actually rather clearer than the 5.1 mess that was produced for the 2004 disasters. Ironically, it is the 2.0 mix, not the 2004 5.1 remix, which is more similar to, though less complex than, the 6-channel, non-digital, non-surround stereo that was heard theatrically 30 years ago.    A couple of interesting details: one reviewer felt that these DVDs were worse than the 1995 VHS tapes, which he remembered as having been better cleaned up. In point of fact, the LDs from 1993 and the LDs/VHS tapes from 1995 were the *same* THX remasterings--just packaged differently; having seen both, I can say confidently that neither are nearly as good as these still-below-par DVDs. Moreover, the 1993/5 THX versions from which these DVDs were transferred are full of print damage at the same points--odd for a THX mastering; it means that even for what he said would be the *final* release in 1995, Lucas *already* didn't care about the old versions, as he was about to embark upon his 1997 distortions! Another important point: not all of these DVDs are direct LD transfers. For STAR WARS, the LD, and *every* home video version since the film first appeared on VHS, had the later title scroll that included \\"Episode IV A New Hope.\\" This one, nicely, does not--the first time in a home video release! However, either good elements for this truly original opening do not survive or were not searched for hard enough because the whole frame rocks from side to side somewhat--owing to uneven print shrinkage: it's disconcerting to see a sky full of stars that all move back and forth together. This could have been cleaned up along with the many other points of print damage in the source material. One last observation: someone said that the opening sequence in STAR WARS is time-compressed. That is rubbish: all earlier versions have identical running times *to the second*! Let's not savage Mr. Lucas when he doesn't deserve it, folks.    The problem with allowing George Lucas to clean up, or even anamorphically enhance, *anything* in his original STAR WARS Trilogy is that he obviously wouldn't know when to quit, and we'd get another non-original permutation. It's a shame because far older films have been restored to look much better than the 1977-83 STAR WARS originals in their new DVD releases. Films of this cultural significance deserve far better. But since Lucas can't be trusted not to tinker, perhaps we should be satisfied while we're ahead, even though the results are compromised. If the originals ever do get issued in cleaner and higher-definition, anamorphically enhanced versions, you can bet that something will also be missing--again! My guess, however, is that Lucas regards his first versions merely as historical artifacts, remembering all the grief they caused him in the making; he obviously prefers to forget about them, continuing to insist that his most recent thoughts, however inferior we all find them, are the standards. It also occurs to me that Fox is testing the market: sure, thousands have been clamoring for the genuine films for years, but they wanted to see if we'd shell out the cash even for technically outmoded versions. Well, now we have. Perhaps they will realize that, despite how much we are currently protesting about Fox's (and perhaps Lucas') greed, when the originals are restored--not changed, just restored, preferably without Mr. Lucas' \\"assistance\\"--we will, in fact, buy them. In the meantime, these are better than nothing. Watch them on a 4x3 SDTV.
B000H305U0|2.0|Pre-ordered this on the strength of Pharrell's production last album (not on the weak effort by Sexyback) only to find that Timbaland is the exclusive producer on this album which is unfortunate due to his latest fasicination with an overproduced 'degraded electro' R&B sound. Just like Nelly Furtado's new record only Justin singing. I incorrectly assumed that Pharrell and Timbaland would again be sharing production credits. Oh well...for an artist like Justin he's going to be as good or as bad as the person producing the tracks. Unfortunately for him Timbaland is definitely in a slump creatively at the moment (past 2 years). The tracks and the vocals just don't function as one cohesive solid production. Justin...you need to bring Pharrell back...not your sexy
0156027321|5.0|I actually read this book back when it was first picked up for Barnes and Noble Discover New Authors section.  Luckily, that was before the hype started.    This book is about a boy who survives a shipwreck and finds himself on a small lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger.  After months at sea, he arrives on the coast of Mexico with an incredible story.  But is it the truth?  Or, is it a question of faith?    You may have heard a tremendous amount of hype about this book.  If you are like me, that will tend to turn you away from a book.  Don't let it.  Life of Pi won't change your life or give you a new sense of spirituality or any such nonsense, but it is a riveting and thoughtful book and very well written.    I highly recommend it.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|Ya sure they have some good tunes on here. But as far as making this the 1 Guns cd,with every killer tune they did. This falls short by mile! <br />  There isnt one song from Lies,Lies,Lies on here. Just another way for Axel to squeeze another buck outta of the fans. Fan? Any die hard Guns fan should be disapointed.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This double disk is not only the Chili Peppers' best cd(s), but it is one of the best cds to be released by ANYONE for at least 5 years.  Every song on these cds is awesome.  If you're not even a Peppers fan, this cd will certainly make you into one.
B00013F38K|5.0|When anything is presented by the television industry there is an amount of conceit. Television shows aren't written in the altruistic desire to better the world or bring about a greater quality of life. They are created to create revenue for advertisers and networks. With all of this being true, the fact that Kung Fu was EVER produced, in whatever form, is astounding. Here is a television show that preaches the basic Buddhist and Taoist concepts of non-action, non-contention, non-violence, charity, humility, peace and inner growth. Depictions of the futility of violence, racism, vengeance crop up in every episode. In today's world, such messages should be cherished and presented to our children; that they might learn to RESPECT LIFE and ignore the bravado and pretence that lead to a withered soul. <br />        If you are looking for fight scenes from The Matrix (silly as THOSE are), you're out of luck. Shaolin monks don't tend to spout tough catch phrases and fly through the air. Like others who have actually studied martial arts seriously I will admit that David Carradine is not phenomenal, but he was not a martial artist. He did endeavour to improve as time went on, when he could have insisted on a full-time stuntman and really cheated the audience. The producers chose who they chose, it's been thirty years and recalling the realities of the past seems fruitless given that the show obviously inspired some of us to better ourselves physically, mentally and spiritually. I learned far more about how to treat others from watching this show that I did from the realities of Hollywood, which is not exactly the Mecca of common sense or decency. <br />        The aspect ratio is what it is. I watch this show for the simple wisdom it offers, not for cinematic value. I see no purpose in railing against what I cannot change, although I am pleased that comments have made it to the manufacturers and the other seasons are presented in full screen. <br />        I havenoticed several claims of racism, although I have not as such noted a predominant ire from Asians- the only party with the right to make a fuss. None of these inflammatory rants seemed to point out Koreans and Japanese `defiling' themselves by pretending to be Chinese for the role they played. I do not believe that Albert Salmi was actually Irish, nor is Gregory Sierra Armenian- I, for one, would not expect them to change chromosomes in order to play a role. I believe that William Shatner is Canadian, but he dared to play a starship captain from Iowa! Are dwarves being persecuted because Ian Holm played Bilbo Baggins? Dennis Franz played an Italian cop on Hill Street Blues, while wantonly remaining German. As an American Indian, I am pleased that my people were often asked to portray Indians. A great deal of racial respect seems to have resided in this show, given the times in which it was made. <br />        Finally, one personal point of disapproval regarding comments: The formidable folks in my Jujitsu class seemed rather impressed that I studied Tai Chi for years, noting how fast people with Tai Chi training picked up other martial arts. Granted, one may not find 'Tai Chi Master' as a choice for an Xbox game- that does make an ancient martial art worthless. I've seen Tai Chi students make rather effective use of their art. We don't earn sashes because we beat the top level of Demon Ninja Piggies. Most importantly, those who study such disciplines have an obligation to cherish and preserve life. We prove ourselves through our actions, not needless displays of brute force and never through empty boasts or uninformed verbiage.  <br />        Purchase this set, watch it with your family and think about what is being said. Your world is what YOU make it to be. Make it a better place by asking rather than assuming. Then turn the television off and get some exercise- it's a nice day out there.  <br />
B00000AFFF|4.0|I am a huge fan of Bacharach, but just after I bought this, I heard Costello and hated him.  So this CD sat unopened for a couple of years.<br /><br />I was going through my CDs and I finally decided to check this out, expecting to throw it away after one listen.  But I was shocked by how good it was.<br /><br />I still would not put Elvis Costello in a list of my top 10 singers.  At best, I am neutral about him.  But with the songs in this CD, neutral is OK by me, the songs and the charts are that good.<br /><br />Anything that Bacharach does is interesting, his songs are filled with fascinating and unexpected things.  The charts are wonderful, my favorite being The Sweetest Punch with that gong on the chorus.  Toledo is wonderful as well.<br /><br />I am glad I decided to listen to this with open ears.
0517123207|2.0|First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted.  Some creationists have decided to use this title to expose Darwin as a racists.  He may be, I have not read \\"The Descent of Man\\" yet.  The origin of species talks very little of man.  It is a book of observations and study.  It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today.  The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change.  Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth.  I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon.  This is called variation of kind.  We see this in just about every living creature and flora.  The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird).  Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.     There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book.  It is a difficult read.  I would rather have read the dictionary.  One does need to know his enemy.  Darwin is not the originator of \\"evolution.\\"  There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time.  He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical.  Darwin was nothing new, he just maid it \\"hip.\\"  What he started has turned into the secular humanism the world has adopted.  I don't think he meant for this disease to spread like it has.  From his writings I understand him as an agnostic, but doubtful.  I believed he struggled with the possibly of a deist.  It is safe to say it was his only ambition till his dying day to prove \\"evolution\\" as proof of our existence.  What of the missing fossil record?, he new they would be found.  He was a confusing man.     150 years later and there still has been no intermediate fossils found to prove the case.  In fact we are discovering more that validates creation.     The theory of evolution caused Darwin to loose his faith and his experience has been repeated in countless lives.  Evolution is an acid that eats away at the mind, a cancer.     One only needs to open the pages to Michael Behe's book, \\"Darwin's Black Box\\", to understand the futility of the evolutionary theory.  The engines of life at the molecular level are so complex that there leaves no other possibility than a creator of the universe.  There should be no excuse.    Wish you well  Scott
068981528X|5.0|The story of the Three Little Pigs has been around for years and years and few children, nor adults, for that matter do not know of it.  Here we have the roles of the \\"bad guy\\" completely reversed.  The kids love this one and think it is truely funny.  I did like the fact that the wolves did not receive the bad press that they normally receive in such tales and I did like the fact that even though the Big Bad Pig was truely bad in the beginning, he did indeed have redeeming features.  The illustrations were great and the text followed the illustrations perfectly.  This is a fun book to read to the class.  I highly recommend this one.
0684857219|5.0|I originally bought this book around 20 years ago. I read it from cover to cover many times and  learned a tremendous amount! Years ago, I regrettably lent it out without ever getting it back so I recently bought another copy for my son when he started weight training.     While it's true that there may be some things that may not be completely up to date scientifically, overall the positives of this book (and to me it's 99 percent positive) easily outweigh any negatives.     Of course many of the routines are probably way too intense for a natural bodybuilder/weight trainer. I have always trained naturally (with whey and soy protein presently being my supplements of choice plus a few vitamins). Therefore I don't attempt to do overly insane routines that would be appropriate for someone using steroids or other performance enhancing drugs.     To me, the greatest value of this book is as a compendium of bodybuilding exercises and their execution. I've never seen another book of it's kind as well organized or put together in terms of it's photographs and explanations. It is VERY through!      While it's true, as others have pointed out, that the vast majority of pictures in the book show \\"juiced up\\" bodybuilders, the information in the book is still incredibly useful. For someone who trains naturally, it would be easy to overtrain if you try to follow the amount of sets that a drug enhanced bodybuilder  can get away with.      I made the mistake of overtraining for many years thinking that more was better, BIG mistake (with small results)! I'm making much better gains these days doing less, though working out with more intensity, and recovering (and growing) more. So if you are natural, it would be unrealistic to expect to ever look like those pictures in the book, though you can still get tremendous gains in size and strength!     If you are looking for a book to show you just about every imaginable bodybuilding exercise then I highly recommend Arnold's Encylopedia.It's a great resource to have available which I refer to all the time. For example I'll use it to often point out or reinforce a detail to my son of how an exercise should be performed. I find it useful for myself as well to brush up on my own training form.
068983571X|4.0|\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.<br /><br />But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

B00080Z53O|3.0|Whilst artistically this film is  extremely well done and the actors are giving superb performances, I found the story wholly imbalanced in the sense that there was very weak advocacy on what is effectively the other side of the coin: that perhaps life is an obligation after all and not a right or - the happy medium viewpoint - that life is neither a right nor an obligation; it is a mission and should be treated respectfully and responsibly.    There is a line that stresses this interlinkage very poignantly when the main hero's father says that there is only one thing worse than one's child dying and that is one's child wanting to die.     In my view, all beings are inextricably linked to each other and no link is less important than another. Therefore, if a link connecting A to B cannot (or rather should not) be broken by C killing B, how can, or why should, the link connecting the main character of this film with his father, his brother, his nephew and the two women that fell in love with him, ever be unilaterally and intentionally broken by that main character?    It would have been nice to have seen a fierce debate foiled out by the characters of the film, particularly during the court scene, which was exceptionally poor in my opinion, as was the rather pathetic and short lived attempt of the quadriplegic clergyman.    In short, the film presents us with a monolithic viewpoint and does not entice the viewer (or at least not this viewer) with a dillema about the wider purpose of life, the responsibilities we all have towards those around us and whether it is right to seek a black or white position for ourselves that places us either below or above life.    Having said this, the film is highly watchable and the actors are a feast to the eyes and ears with their outstanding performances.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Ignore myths of sisterhood. Women can be nasty, catty, devious, gossipy and gleeful -- especially about each other. So expect lots of that in \\"The Women,\\" a screwball comedy about divorce, remarriage, affairs and lots and lots of inner feuding. It's a practically perfect girls' movie.<br /><br />The uppermost ladies of Manhattan lunch, spa, shop and especially gossip together. So when Mary Haines' (Norma Shearer) hubby takes a perfume-counter mistress Crystal (Joan Crawford), the other women try to keep it from her. But Mary finds out, and after confronting her husband with his infidelity, she demands a divorce -- and so it's off to Reno with her goody-two-shoes pal Peggy (Joan Fontaine).<br /><br />She spends the next few weeks at a ranch with other soon-to-be-divorced women, including her neurotic cousin, a much-divorced countess and a vixen. And though Mary still loves her husband, he feels obligated to marry Crystal. But then Mary's daughter reveals some juicy new information about Crystal -- and Mary's pals band together to help her set things right.<br /><br />\\"The Women\\" is an all-star cast, with all women. Not a man to be seen or even heard (although I can't vouch for the animals) -- even the kids are all girls. This allows the attention to remain on The Women, whether it's the naive girls, kindly matrons or the catty hens.<br /><br />The original play was by Clare Boothe Luce, but Anita Loos gives it her own witty spin.  And Loos -- the original chick-litter -- knew how to spin witty, sparking dialogue without breaking a sweat (\\"She's got those eyes that run up and down a man like a searchlight!\\").<br /><br />The plot moves at a fast pace, with the occasional lull, where we get some barbed dialogue about marriage and infidelity. Few movies can handle catfights in a really funny manner (Sylvia biting Miriam on the leg), throw in some insights about men and women's relationships, a dash of romance, revenge, and a climactic battle that involves a broom closet.<br /><br />Shearer, Paulette Goddard and Mary Boland are all great as women hardened and strengthened by having their guy stolen; Rosalind Russell is hilarious as Shearer's immature, weirdly-dressed cousin, and Joan Crawford is as slimy and vicious as her role demands. The one dark spot is Virginia Weidler, who basically has to simper and whimper -- sadly, because she was delightful in \\"Philadelphia Story.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Women\\" prove that oftentimes, the female of the species is more deadly -- and more resourceful -- than the male.

B000002H33|5.0|Metallica really raised the bar for thrash metal with this one. The songwriting and structure on all of these songs are simply amazing. Battery starts out with a beautiful spanish-style acoustic piece, than crushes you once the guitars become distorted. A hell of a way to start such a classic album! The title track comes next, and is nothing short of amazing. I love the long bridge in the middle, it's like a whole other song in itself. Pure genius! The Thing That Should Not Be is another great song. It's a little slower, yet heavy as hell. It has such an evil feel to it. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) is another classic. Very haunting song, and the lyrics are some of the best you'll hear anywhere. Another highlight is Orion, which is an instrumental. This is probably my favorite song on the whole album, because not many bands can write nearly 10 minutes of instrumental, and actually make it work. Cliff Burton wrote a good portion of this song, and it shows just how much of a musical genius he was. Great piece of music there. Than, of course there's Damage Inc. Just listen to it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Awesome!!  <br /> <br />I remember being around 10 years of age when I first heard this album on cassette (yeah, I was around when cassettes were the thing), and along with Ride The Lightning, it made me obsessed with heavy metal. This was the last album they recorded when  the late great Cliff Burton (RIP) was alive, and it shows. On ...And Justice For All, they stuck to nearly the same formula. No song was under the five minute mark, but for some reason it felt like something was missing. Without a doubt, that something is Cliff Burton. He added a classical music sort of vibe to Metallica, and he is sorely missed. He truly is a legend! This album is a must have for all metalheads!!
B000FQJAIW|5.0|At what point did the technology and media used to view a film become more important than the film itself? <br /> <br />Could the picture quality be better?  Maybe, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it and probably looks just as good as it did when I saw it as an impressionable five-year-old back in '77.  Is the soundtrack \\"only\\" in stereo, and not 5.1 surround?  Yep, but that's how I heard it back then, too. <br /> <br />The fact of the matter is the \\"bonus\\" disc contains the original, unedited, unaltered version of the film as George Lucas presented to us- the same film that had such a huge impact upon myself and thousands of other kids growing up in the late 70's and early 80's.   <br /> <br />It offends me that Lucas felt the need to tamper with the original trilogy.  Would the creators of Casablanca go back and colorize the picture because it was shot in black and white?  Would Hitchcock start buggering up his movies simply out of boredom, or because the technology allowed him to do so?  I doubt it.  So what gives Lucas the right?  <br /> <br />And why are we more concerned with sound formats and aspect ratios than with the content of the movie we're watching at home?  A great movie is a great movie, whether seen on a 12-inch black-and-white television or on a state of the art home theatre system. It's the content we should be concerned with, plain and simple.  Do we watch this film over and over for the characters and story, or because of an anamorphic transfer and surround sound?  Star Wars was made in 1977, with the technology of the day.  Does it look dated by today's technological standards?  You bet it does, and I love it for it. <br /> <br />For those who wish to be able to watch the films that were such an important and enjoyable part of their childhood, I HIGHLY recommend this two disc set.  You won't be disappointed.  I can't wait to pick up Empire and Jedi next; these are the versions I'll introduce my five month old son to.  For those who'reimpressed by today's CGIed, surround sound explosion fests, void of any real content, characters, or story, pass on it and wait for Georgie Boy and the next round of home theatre technology to \\"new and improve\\" the trilogy.
B000000OPQ|4.0|Liked the album & movie but in the soundtrack they should have dropped Don Henley's \\"She On The Zoom \\" ( weak song) for Berlin's \\"No More Words\\" which was in the film but not included on the soundtrack. Well, at the very least should have added the song to it.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|Ok, it's kind of an industry standard to release a low-quality knock-off of the original, when a director has a Director's Cut and hates his early work. <br /> <br />However, this \\"theatrical release\\" suffers from more than faded bad print and schlock soundtrack -- it's obviously a dub from TELEVISION, because the opening scene where Leia's ship is chased by the starcruiser is TIME COMPRESSED! <br /> <br />In fact, to get a feel for what the original felt like in red plush movie theater seats, you have to watch the opening sequence from Spaceballs!  The first (the very, very first!) star cruiser came into view, and came into view, and came into view, and the small recessed bay appeared, and the ship continued, and the LARGE recessed bay appeared and went by, and went by, and the ship continued, and the end of the ship appeared, and went by. <br /> <br />Ok, I can understand why Lucas hates that scene, because really it only works the first time you see it -- as Mel Brooks understood very well in his parody of the shot.  But really...  Really, now!  A TIME COMPRESSED version of the opening chase?  They only made those for television, and THIS derivative piece of schlock is a rip.

Hard to belive....
B00005JOQS|1.0|Let me begin by stating that the original Superman film with Chris Reeve is one on my dearest memories from childhood. From the majestic opening credits to the uncanny way they made his flying believable (the pre-CGI days..remember those?). Verisimilitude is what Donner called it..making the unbelievable seem totally grounded in reality. Seeing that film with my Dad in the Christmas of 78 will be etched in my memory for a long time. Why, you ask? Not because I was 9 and the world seemed innocent and fresh and not because every kid loves a superhero flick. It was because Donner completely NAILED that character. He took what would seem to be a sappy, boy scout, goodie-goodie character seem respectable and completely admirable. This during the jaded and disillusioned 70's. We rooted not only for Reeve, the wide eyed young actor in his first major film role, but for Superman and all his \\"truth, justice, and the American way\\" idealism. Even during the post-Vietnam skepticism that the country was still tasting. <br />That said...enter Bryan Singer. Here's a guy that made one of the best crime dramas ever put on celluloid (The Usual Suspects) as well as taking an obscure, although having a rabid fan following, comic book and making two films that not only NAILED the nature and spirit of the source material, but made it accessible for even the most clueless of film-goers. I'm talking, of course, about X-Men.  <br /> <br />If ever I had faith in a director to bring back the Man-Of-Steel to a new generation of movie watchers and possibly recapture the magic of the original Donner film, he was just the guy to do it. This is what makes this review all the more painful because he did just the opposite. Not only did I find this film to be a complete insult to the Superman mythos new and old, but I found it to be melodramatic dribble. <br /> <br />Singer manages to suck you in at the opening credits with Brando's voice overlooking the planet Krypton as we know it to be in the original film. Then the planet explodes in a way far more dramatic than the original and it is stunning to watch. The credits roll over John Williams' rousing anthem and the audience is entranced. I almost had tears as I watched with my 11 year-old son as it reminded me so much of my experience with my father. After that..it's all downhill.  <br /> <br />Superman is poorly written as a bit of a creep. Part voyeur (he uses his x-ray vision to spy on Lois at her boyfriend's home), part narcissist in the prideful way he tells Lois the world needs him, and worst of all..part deadbeat dad. If this is a spoiler to you, then you have shown no interest in the film to begin with. Yes, Superman had fathered a child with Lois (see Superman II) and then just took off for 5 years when he discovers that scientists believe Krypton still may exist. This after apologizing to the president for being away for so long at the end of Superman II. This is supposed to be a direct sequel?? Man..Singer and his boys failed to do their research. <br /> <br />Another thing that got on my nerves was the way Singer injected Superman with a Christ complex. Okay Brian..He's the only son of Jor-El and was sent to Earth to save us from ourselves..We get it!!! Having him fall to the Earth in a crucifixion-like way was a bit over the top. One more example of Hollywood's disdain for Christians. I'm sure I'm also not the only one who noticed Perry White's inability to say \\"..and the American way\\". It just come out as \\"Does he still stand for truth, justice, and all that other stuff..?\\". One more example of Hollywood's hatred for American pride and values. <br /> <br />Some of you may be wondering..\\"Why so upset over a stupid comic book movie?\\". I'll tell you why. Superman is the icon and the standard by which all superheroes that have followed him owe a tremendous debt to. He got us through the darkest days of the depression and World War II. We flew with him during the cynicism of the Vietnam era and the trashed sensibilities brought forth by the \\"flower power\\" generation. Even through highs and lows in popularity, he has always been someone to look up to in a metaphoric way. Someone good, honest, and unwavering in his morals and standards. Now in an age of conflict and uncertainty, when this country could use Superman the most, Singer belittles him and turns him into a man more damaged than anyone we could possibly know.  <br /> <br />Apart from Routh and Spacey, the film was poorly cast as well. Lois looks like she's fresh out of college, much less the mother of a five-year-old boy. That after having been around the block a time or two. Bosworth is still in her mid to late 20's and simply can't pull off that character. Langella was a dull Perry White. There was no fire to that character whatsoever. Worst of all...Parker Posey. The mighty indie queen has fallen.  <br /> <br />In a nutshell..if you're reading this Mr. Singer. You should simply walk away from Superman all together before you do any more damage than you already have.
006056251X|5.0|I am so used to reading other, less inspiring authors (my last pick was Jane Feather) that I pick up each book of this series with my breath held.  Will it  be as good as the last one?  It can't possibly live up to my expectations.  But every time she has!  I absolutely love each book!  With each book, not only does she tell a wonderful love story involving the 2 main characters, but she keeps the other wallflowers coming back.  So many times, series start out strong and then you never hear about the other characters or the bond that brought them together ceases to exist.  But Ms. Kleypas keeps each girl coming back; you get to see their joys in marriage, the friendship holds strong, and they continue to depend on one another.  Each and every one of her Wallflower books is so heart-warming while at the same time being exciting and passionate.<br /><br />Sebastian is a wonderful villian and his transformation into kind, caring husband is NOT as unrealistic as some people have said.  I thought it was wonderful and I love the unexpected jealousy he feels and tries to fight; failing miserably of course.  And Evie is a great female heroine.  Her character was more than I expected and I loved the chemistry between them.
B000FIMG68|2.0|Lost !  originality  Lost ! train of thought  Lost ! ideas  Lost ! characters that are not stupid  the finder PLEASE return these to the creators of Lost!    Are you kidding me?  \\"incredible\\", \\"the best show ever\\" ?   How about \\"get a life\\"! this season is by far one of the most boring and slow seasons of all time in TV history, not to mention fallacious. This is another example for success of a show that only ruins itself , now the network wants more episodes because of the high ratings and everyone else gets more money , so lets stretch this show until the ratings fall and then cancel it ,who cares about quality and somewhat credible storyline. I'm not surprised they barely got Emmy nominations this year ,they didn't deserve it ,I thought last year they also didn't deserve winning best drama (!?) shows like \\"Six Feet Under\\" and \\"The Shield\\" deserve it much more, but I guess you can't argue with hype , though last season was better than this one. I hope that next season will compensate on this year's lingering boredom and lack of originality.  But if you like shows that are full with unresolved mysteries , pointless storylines and the feeling of dissatisfaction then I highly recommend this one !

1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween expands on the origin story created by Frank Miller with Batman: Year One.  Gotham City is ruled by mobsters with Carmine Falcone at the head.  Batman finds that he can't bring Falcone down on his own but the shaky alliances he formed with Harvey Dent and Lieutenant Gordon in the first book merge to find the three working together to bring down the mob boss.  As Falcone's men start getting knocked off systematically on holidays (the mystery killer is subsequently dubbed \\"Holiday\\"), Batman, Gordon and Dent scramble to uncover the killer's identity and get as much evidence as possible to incriminate Falcone.  The twists and turns through this 13 issue series are classic, iconic, and confusing making rereads not only necessary but exciting as well.  The morally ambiguous conclusion and the surprise ending by Jeph Loeb brilliantly recall the mood of such classic films as The Empire Strikes Back and The Usual Suspects; his work here is his best in any medium.  Tim Sale's physically intimidating Batman is the perfect blend of seasoned fighter, master detective, and stealthy prowler and the art is consistently beautiful and brooding throughout the series.  The Long Halloween is Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's most famous and critically acclaimed book and the brilliant world they create to transition from Miller's Gotham to the classic Gotham that readers are familiar with, by including cameos of some of the pantheon of Batman villains in their \\"earliest\\" appearances, is masterful.  Anyone looking to read up on the Dark Knight would do well to start with Year One and then pick up this classic tale of crime and mystery in Gotham City.

0618551050|5.0|Everything the author discusses in this book is interesting, both from a technical standpoint and from the anecdotal commentary on what it is like to work in academia. That is not to say that all of its contents are justified from a scientific standpoint, but the author it is fair to say is aware of this. Some of his opinions on the mindsets of string theorists strain credulity, but they never reach the level of vituperation that frequently accompanies debate on the viability and purpose of string theory in the context of the scientific body of knowledge. The book is accessible to a \\"popular\\" readership, but readers with a stronger background in both physics and mathematics will appreciate the book more.<br /><br />To put the theme of the book in the proper context, the author lists five \\"great problems\\" that he believes should be the goal of physicists to resolve. This collection should actually be a list of six, with the inclusion of the bound state problem. The bound state problem, i.e. the prediction of a bound state using the formalism of quantum field theory, has resisted solution to this day, despite the efforts of extremely brilliant individuals. Quantum field theory is a formalism that was invented to study scattering problems, and it seems that this is what it is best suited to do. Even the concept of a bound state may therefore be alien to quantum field theory. All six of these problems are difficult, and should challenge future generations of physicists.<br /><br />The author's polemic against string theory is fairly convincing but at times he could stand to back off a few steps. Yes, string theory has been around for about two decades now with no experimental evidence to substantiate it. In addition, its theoretical foundations seem mysterious and even cryptic at times. If cognizance is made of this, and of the difficulty of the mathematics used, it is appropriate to say that maybe string theory may not have had enough time to make reasonable experimental predictions. Two decades may seem like a long time, but there does not exist a way of benchmarking research projects that would predict the \\"mean time to experimental discovery\\" that would serve to justify the theoretical formalism.<br /><br />Beyond the social commentary on `groupthink' and other supposed characteristics of the string theory community, there are many interesting discussions in this book on new research directions. These include the GZK prediction, the Auger experiment, noncommutative geometry, quantum groups, the Ashtekar reformulation of general relativity in terms of gauge fields, double special relativity, and topos theory, this last topic being of intense interest recently with accompanying complaints about it being difficult to learn.<br /><br />The author also makes the claim that the Planck length is the same for all observers is interesting, since distance scales much larger than this length it seems would also require this invariance. This is due to the property that is sometimes amusingly called \\"quantum claustrophobia\\", which alludes to the fact that a particle in a potential with \\"narrow\\" regions from a quantum mechanical point of view tends to avoid these regions. If one could transform away this property, this would imply that quantum fluctuations would depend on the reference frame, a conclusion that is not observed experimentally (at least assuming a flat background). This \\"claustrophobia\\" can also show up in the classical phase space, as researchers in symplectic geometry have shown in the guise of the `capacity' of phase-space volumes.<br /><br />Even though it is fair to say that the author is exaggerating, he speaks of a \\"crisis\\" in physics. But is not a crisis what is really needed to spark the next new ideas, the next \\"revolution\\", as was the case for classical physics at the beginning of the twentieth century? Perhaps a crisis in physics is just the right stimulus to provoke highly creative thinking in finding unificationschemes that make testable predictions, unlike the string theories of today.<br /><br />There are many other discussions in the book that are amusing and inspiring, such as the attitude of the great mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, and the astounding statement by the physicist Leonard Susskind on the anthropic principle and \\"intelligent design.\\" Grothendieck's method for doing mathematical research is definitely a model for many to follow, if they can forget about the need for \\"prestige\\" and recognition that a traditional career might bring. And the Grothendieck example is just one of many that gives strong evidence that the most profound research seems to be done outside the academy, where individuals are not pressured to publish and can concentrate on problems that take long periods of time for their resolution.<br /><br />But if string theory is a fad it is more than just an obsession with hula-hoops or pet rocks. It requires an enormous background in mathematics as well as physics, the learning of which must usually be done alone. If string theorists appear to be getting lost in the formalism this is no surprise, due to its inherent complexity. And one must not impute arrogance to them when in fact their attitude may be a way for them to build confidence in their ability to work on very difficult problems. After all, they are confronting problems that the vast majority of humankind will never have to think about.<br /><br />The anecdotal stories about eminent mathematicians and physicists are interesting, particular about the mathematician Alain Connes, one of the inventors of noncommutative geometry and who has done some interesting work on the renormalization problem in quantum field theory. The author describes noncommutative geometry as being a formalism that leads directly to the standard model, but one wonders whether this was by design or whether it is rich enough to predict extensions to the standard model.<br /><br />The author refers too many times to a \\"younger\\" generation of physics who will be motivated to tackle fundamental problems without taking up the gauntlet of string theory. But there are many \\"older\\" physicists who might decide to leave research in string theory or some other field they are currently in and take on these problems. Their experience in both physics and in the vicissitudes of academic life will make them formidable researchers and just as capable in arriving at fresh ideas. The author does recognize this however in the last statement of part three of the book fortunately. And the author claims that fundamental physics has made very little progress in the last twenty years, but how does he quantify this exactly? How does one measure progress or even indeed originality or creativity? The artificial intelligence community is begging for answers to these questions.<br /><br />The author proposes constructive solutions to the problems in the physics departments throughout the United States. But more can be added to his suggestions, one being that the tenure system must be modified, possibly in the creation of fifteen-year blocks of granted time, in order to ensure competition is not stifled. In addition, the system of anonymous reviewing must be stopped, with the goal of eliminating the hateful and cynical dialog that sometimes creeps into reviews. Reviewers should openly stand by their commentary with as much confidence as they do their own research articles. Patronage must end and full disclosure of prior affiliation must take place.<br /><br />So yes, the university to a large extent is Byzantine in its employment practices. Hiring in colleagues and friends and placing them in important positions is common, with the same happening for seminars and other public talks. The university is definitely not an aristocracy of ability, and if it is \\"fiercely competitive\\" as the author describes it, this is a somewhat banal description of the intense networking and conference hopping that takes place between \\"competitors.\\"<br /><br />The author has an interesting suggestion about teaching quantum physics in the first year of undergraduate, and then deriving Newtonian mechanics from this in the classical limit. He describes in some detail the hostility he received from other faculty to his proposal in this regard. A fierce resistance to change ironically is systematic in the university. One could in this regard describe it as conservative, despite its frequent characterization as being a cesspool of liberalism by some conservative intellectuals.to tackle fundamental problems without taking up the gauntlet of string theory.

B000E1155E|3.0|...of much better bands. The Arctic Monkeys have been quickly labeled as a brilliant, breakthrough band by their fans and a great deal of the British media. The NME has hailed \\"Whatever People Say I Am, I'm Not\\" as one of the best British albums ever, ranking it at #5, just below The Beatles, The Smiths, Oasis, and The Sex Pistols and ranking higher than Blur, Pulp, The Clash, and The Libertines!  The NME has earned quite a reputation for seizing upon certain new bands and shoving them in everyone's face; they did this with The Libertines. The difference is, however, that The Libertines were worthy of this recognition because they were actually a fantastic band and have been a major influence for newer bands. Some people, obviously, may disagree because musical genius is up to personal interpretation...but, to me, the Arctic Monkeys merely sound like the leftover scraps, bits, and pieces of their contemporaries. I thought \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" was rather catchy, so I bought the whole CD. I can't say I was disappointed, because it was exactly what I was expecting; more of the same! Though that particular song is a highlight (as well as \\"The View from the Afternoon\\", \\"Riot Van, and \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\"), the rest of the album is VERY forgettable. I've listened to it several times now, but I really don't recall most of the other songs off-hand until I hear them again. This album got to #24 at it's peak in the US and #1 in the UK (where it had the fastest first week sales of an album in UK history). It's not a particularly unfortunate thing that they're popular; they are, at least, a decent band. The problem that I have is that they're kind of stealing the thunder from some bands (like the Kaiser Chiefs and Bloc Party) that are far more polished and memorable than the Arctic Monkeys. It's also easy to pick up the hint of influence of The Strokes and The Libertines lurking within many of the songs. Perhaps this band's originality will finally come through in their second album.

If you have one or both, buy this and sell the other/others\\".<br /><br />Concerning the product information, the first compilation, \\"The singles 81-85\\" contains one CD and it represents the remasters of the same album launched initially in 1985, containing Depeche Mode's singles lauched between 1981 and 1985, plus two bonus tracks: \\"Photographic\\" (Some bizzare version) and \\"Just can't get enough\\" (Schizo mix). The first was released on the compilation \\"The bizzare album\\", the first item wich features a Depeche Mode song.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|While reading over all these reviews I notice the constant comparison to past Iron Maiden releases. Most, like myself are happy with this one, and say that the new release `A Matter of Life And Death' is `better' than some of the more recent studio releases and a few who don't think it's all that great. Well, the thing to realize is that every individual album has it's own distinctive personality, an individual work of art, even if it's done by the same band. From the early days, albums which in their time blew me away, such as their first self-titled debut, Killers, NOTB, Piece of Mind, Powerslave etc. each has it's own particular feel or taste, although with certain stylistic `Iron Maiden' trademarks that still prevail of course, and the new album, AMOLAD is no different. These musicians are not getting any younger, and fortunately or unfortunately (depending on your opinion) their outlook and approach will change and/or mature over time. The bottom line is that Iron Maiden still say true to their brand of heavy metal. No, we won't ever hear another 'Piece of Mind', but we won't hear another AMOLAD either. The music here is tight, heavy, often complex, and as always a pleasure to listen to. Enjoy this album for what it is - a particular musical statement made at particular point in time. BTW, just wondering if the next IM release will be another live album, I hope not....
B000002U82|5.0|it's too damn good.  Dark Side of the Moon, perhaps more so than any other album in rock and roll history, tends to be liked because of a certain cool factor (possibly tied with Nevermind and Zeppelin IV).  Every stoner and wannabe stoner will put this in their top 5 and say things like \\"It's a trip,maaaaan\\", while making to sure to wear a Dark Side T-shirt to let everybody know they have cool status.  Nevertheless, I must give credit where it is due, and this truly is one of the most innovative and pleasing works of the past 50 years.  In fact, the only Pink Floyd album that tops it IMO is The Wall, which I would rank as the single greatest album of all time. <br /> <br />Anyway this is an album which absolutely must be listened to straight through, as the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Fortunately the parts are pretty damn great in their own.    That is evidenced by the fact that half these songs are heard in regular rotation on every classic rock station in the English speaking world.  Those hits include \\"Breathe\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Us and Them\\", and \\"Brain Damage\\", but the sweetest slice of this pie may be \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", where the piano and vocals complement one another to take you on an emotional ride thought impossible by the means of mere music.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|I saw the theatrical version on VHS many years ago, and it didn't really make sense. I thought maybe it was because it was a David Lynch film, and it wasn't supposed to...Then I remembered that it was based on Frank Herbert's incredibly complex sci-fi classic, and decided a 2 hour film couldn't be coherent. Then I taped a TV 4 hour version; editing the commercials, it came to about 3 hours. There was narration by someone with an English accent; I couldn't understand a word. Then, 20 years later, a DVD, of Lynch's extended version directed by Alan Smithee (the Ed Wood of anonymity). I watched the extended version other day, and it was entertaining. One thing about the new DVD: Side one is the Lynch version, side 2 (extended) is completely unlabeled. Certainly, some of the action scenes were intriguing. The sets (and background artwork) were certainly visionary, and the wide 2.35:1 LBX was very well presented. Also, the narration was by a different person than from the TV version I'd taped those years ago. I understood every word. Why Mr. Lynch took his name off the film escapes me. I actually enjoyed a lot of the film. There were especially fine performances from Jose Ferrer, Max von Sydow, Sting, Francesca Annis, Dean Stockwell and Brad Dourif. And Kyle MacLachlan used his customary stiff acting approach to good advantage, carrying the lead role quite well. Handsome guy...Aficianados can pull this film apart without mercy, and the Herbert fans will probably do the same, but I watch films to be entertained and I was. It's not great, and not always coherent, but it was great to put on during a rainy Saturday afternoon. Purists, stay away; film fans and sci-fi freaks, enjoy!
B00000JY1X|5.0|The lyrics are incredibly clever and persuasive, with some of the lilt and good humor of Ogden Nash, the poetaster of the 30s, 40s and 50s who wrote ONE TOUCH OF VENUS with Kurt Weill.  And Merritt's tunes, though some are rudimentary, occasionally reach for and pull down the high branches of Weillian angst and poisoned romance.  To listen to the whole of 69 LONE SONGS you'd have to have a big appetite for irony, and another whole set of immunity to purposely \\"corny\\" music, and if you didn't get your fill of banjo, Hawaiian, lounge and Americana music from the last couple of Van Dyke Parks LPs you listened to, you might be hungry all over again for the nutty richness of this compilation.<br /><br />It hasn't left my turntable in four years, for by the time I finish one of the three LPs, it's always time for the less familiar second one, and to gear up anticipation for the already forgotten third.<br /><br />One thing I don't like is the booklet that comes with the box set.  It marks a platinum standard in self-aggrandization.  Remember the Rolling Stone Interviews that used to glorify even the most unlikely interview subject (say, Axl Rose or whoever).  Imagine then if Axl Rose re-packaged the interview some flunky did with him, and tried to sell it to you with his LP, except a hugely expanded edition which tried to say that he was the best songwriter and in fact genius of all time.  That gives you a taste of the booklet's effrontery.  It's kind of not cool, but what do I know.  I've seen it on the nightstands of a dozen young hipsters who have memorized all of the questions and all of the answers and whose mouths lipsync the whole 28,000 words in their sleep.
0684135051|2.0|I started knitting a few months ago and thought this could help me to get beyond scarves.  I suppose it would if I were a sewing expert, but alas, I am not.  I guess it's good for advanced knitters and designers, but not being born with natural talent for this, I need something more basic before I can comprehend this.  If you're a beginner, save your money.  I got more out of Stitch-n-Bitch and Leisure Arts pamphlets than I did from this book.  Maybe I'll pick it up again in a couple of years.
B000002WPI|5.0|Revolutionary.  Its been 13 years since this album was released, yet everytime i pull it out i listen to it with new ears and find a new appreciation for this simple yet masterful work of art. With gritty drum and piano loops, the RZA (producer)found new ways to work with sound.  The eight emcees featured on this album have such a unique style and flare they completely shatter the conventional style, flow and cadencing of rap up to that point.  WuTang has done so much for hip hop, and it started right here with Enter the Wu Tang.  Released in November 1993, this album set the tone for things to come for the next ten years. many who are unfamiliar with this album or any of wu tangs' work maybe wondering how or why this album had such an impact; the truth is it influenced so many at such a crucial point in hip hops progression.  It is one of those works that breaks the barriers and takes music to another level. My favorite album of all time. <br /> <br />
B000002B1M|5.0|I know ILLMATIC is a five star album, but I felt compelled to give this 5 stars as well. I have so many good memories kickin some of the ill verses on this while I walked from class to class in school. I think it was this CD that made me such a huge QB RAP fan. The beats are all well done and like I said a second ago the raps are way good. Enjoy It!!!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|and iron maiden delivers again with a perfect album....damn bruce dickenson can still pitch that voice after all these years...anywayzzz....i picked this album the first day it came out...and i have to say its one of the best in my collection of metal cds, everysong here is an epic, full of rhythms and time changes which makes this ofcourse a progressive metal band, but there is no crap here, its straight out iron maiden, from the familiar drumming we've come to love over the years to the signature bass playing, and the three guitars that mix into one to make one hell of a powerful sound, and ofcourse,, bruce, the master , the man behind the voice, only getting better with age, this album is perfect and worth your money clocking at 76 minutes or so, listen to it fully and appreciate the legend that is Iron Maiden, and if you havent, then start here because you've been missing one hell of a band,.......there is only one little tiny super ultra complaint i have, since this cd was recorded live in the studio, in a loud stereo, sometimes bruce's voice blends with the guitars and can sound a bit distorted, other than that LONG LIVE THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000H305U0|5.0|I enjoyed Justin's first solo album \\"Justified\\", but this album is even better!  Most of the tracks are upbeat and just put you in a good mood and make you want to dance.  The two best (and catchiest) songs are \\"My Love\\" and \\"Lovestoned\\".  Timbaland produced several songs besides \\"Sexyback\\" and I think Justin and Timbaland make a great musical pair.  The only songs I don't really enjoy are the last three.  They are slower and sort of seem out of place when the first 3/4 of the album is so upbeat and dance-oriented.  While the first single \\"Sexyback\\" is catchy, it tends to be repetitive but the rest of the songs on the album are not that way.  In my opinion there are several songs that are better than \\"Sexyback\\".  If you are a Justin fan or enjoyed the first single, then you won't be disappointed by the rest of the album!
B000H4QD1O|1.0|Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Batman Begins will be released Oct. 10th. Would you like to pre-order it? Well you can't from Amazon.  <br /> <br />If anyone that works for Amazon actually reads this, I would love some kind of explanation. In fact, you could put it on the same page as the products that are already released that you show as \\"not yet released.\\" It makes me wonder if I made a mistake in becoming a Prime member. All I want is a little information. <br /> <br />Other titles not available from Amazon but available everywhere else: <br /> <br />Aeon Flux  <br />Four Brothers  <br />We Were Soldiers  <br />The Italian Job  <br />The Manchurian Candidate  <br />U2: Rattle & Hum  <br />Troy <br />King Kong (2005)
B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|As much as I agree with the reviews that point to the wonderful balance of spectacle and intimate biography, I've recently discovered something else about this film: running deeply - though quite subtly - throughout it is the insightful story of how the Middle East became what it is today. The scenes between Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains (and, later, Alec Guinness) show how the English and the French carved up the area for their own interests, with the complicity of the most powerful of the tribal/social leaders (e.g., Guinness, as Prince Feisal). I should emphasize the word subtle, because David Lean was far too good a filmmaker to create a solely political film. But he was also too good a filmmaker to take socio-political subtleties off his palette. If you haven't seen this movie in 10 years or so, take a look again. You'll be amazed at what you didn't rate as important the last time you watched - and you'll appreciate the fact that the film is laden with even more than you remember.
B00005JP87|5.0|I'm amazed that the critics haven't had more to say about this little gem.  Part murder mystery (or is it?), part ghost story (or maybe not), the detective skills of Sherlock Holmes, the obsessive romance of Phantom of the Opera, and the mystery and hoaxmanship of Edgar Cayce all tied up with more twists than a hangman's noose.  Well worth the price of admission -- this one will be in my collection when it comes out on DVD!
B000G75AE8|3.0|...don't get me wrong, it's pretty good. <br /> <br />But \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", this is not.  Particularly because \\"Seasons\\" was fresh and interesting...this CD sticks a little too close to the old formula for my taste.  There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but aside from \\"Skeleton Christ\\", nothing on this CD really got my blood pumping or got me altogether that interested. <br /> <br />You'll buy it.  Because it's Slayer, and that's fine.  I did. It's a good record to listen to in the background.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Okay, Johnny.  I've heard that guitar of yours cry before, but now you're makin' it sexy at the same time?  I love Continuum, ALL OF IT.  But at this moment, I can't get enough of Slow Dancing.  It's killing me, every word, every note.  I haven't danced in that room in many, many years.  My husband and I have been friends for more than 20 years, in love for more than 16 years, happily married for 12 of those.  So, how is it I can smell the smoke?  Amazing.  Thank you.  Yeah, I wish I could listen to Comfortable (and many others) for the first hundred times again, but thanks to this record I don't have to be sad that I can't.  Thank you for stabbing me right in the heart once again.  Me and and one of the best friends the universe was kind enough to give me on our very first day of Jr. High, will be at the show in Houston in a few weeks, same as we were a couple years ago.  Please, do Slow Dancin'.  Bold as Love, too.  Can't wait.  XO  <br />Yeah people, it's that good. <br />Watched the web cast from the ACL Music Fest last night.  Good stuff!  Thank you.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Growing up I was never big into the superheroes comics. I used to read a few, but the story lines would jump around, as the next week&iexcl;¦s edition would be a completely new story (maybe it was my newsagentº) I was really into animation on the TV. The Jackson 5 (remember that?) was one of my favorites, as was the Spiderman series. Thus Spidey became my favorite super hero.  This film really lays it all bare as too why. Firstly here is a super hero I can relate. Shy, nerdy, intelligent, awkward, basically sums up my pre teen years. And did I mention that he&iexcl;¦s hopeless with the fairer sex? Could be meº. This films works on several levels, but essentially it&iexcl;¦s a love story. A love for a girl (Mary Parker), for his extended family, and for the people of New York. Great performances by Toby Maguire,  and Kirsten Dunst, who show a great chemistry, I never tire of watching this. GREAT.
B00002E224|5.0|It is an anomaly when a movie achieves virtuosity in such a simple conversational way. This film swarms the sky of romance at every conceivable level and cooks like a long slow stew. The storyline of romance for a day, coupled with reflective  manuscript bathed in transitory spectrums of infinite possibility with clairvoyant generosity sweltering waves at every turn and awesome interplay between the boy (Ethan Hawke) and the girl (Julie Delpy) makes this film a prime choice to sustain the romantic dreamer on that deserted desert island. Stirring, unique, timeless, barren of peer or competition. Tatooes on the brain the fact that time is fleeting and the time to dance is- now.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I think we can all agree this is an amazing movie, and one of the best vampire films of all, but... <br /> <br /> <br />WHY ISN'T THERE A DIRECTOR'S CUT YET? <br /> <br /> <br />It would sell.  Seriously.  And we all want it.  So please, -please- release a proper special edition, once and for all.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I really CANNOT stand this band any longer. I'm sick of everything they've done during the last year. With endless MTV play and hype and an annoying fanbase, they've definitely sold their soul out after getting signed to a major label.<br /><br />M. Shadows is the most irritating vocalist ever. He cannot sing to save his own life! Wow, we don't need another Axl Rose replica.<br /><br />The guitarists are nothing really special. True, they can solo and such and are better than most of the mainstream stuff these days, but if you really know talent, they're no match for underrated greats like Pater Lake (Theory in Practice) and Muhammed Suicmez (Necrophagist).<br /><br />And the music, well, if you basically dislike 80's arena rock music, you'll hate this band. They just pollute the styles of Guns 'N' Roses and Motley Crue and slap a bunch of fashionXcore B.S. on there.<br /><br />Don't believe any positive hype about this CD. And props to The Strapping Young Lad for saying that \\"Bjork will be more metal than these guys\\", because it's true.<br /><br />If you want REAL talent that doesn't have an irritating fan base surrounding it, I prefer Cryptopsy, Necrophagist, maudlin Of The Well, Meshuggah, Tool, Spawn of Possession, Opeth, Theory In Practice, Into The Moat and Strapping Young Lad.<br /><br />Forget this band.
B000HEYVD6|1.0|My first and last Baldacci book.  The first 380 pages are spent on character and plot development which wouldn't be so bad if the characters weren't stereotypes and completely so unrealistic as to be brutal.  As for plot development, when the author spends so long developing the plot and then the predictable happens you wonder why not do it in 30 pages, not 380.  The plot is so unrealistic you wonder when he'll get to the real one.<br /><br />I also have to agree with some other reviewers, if you think America is at fault for HALF the world's problems you will not like this book.  If you think America is at fault for ALL the world's problems this book is for you.  Again, stereotypic plot, the government is to blame  and can't do anything right.<br />Expect for a few rebels, who for some reason can't even live normal lives.<br /><br />Finally, what I will call a Rodney King ending, \\"Can't we all just get along?\\" Yes, if just we understood the terrorists and saw things from thier point of view all would be hunky dory.  About the most uninspired ending I have ever read.  This book is BRUTAL TO GET THROUGH
B000DWMN2S|5.0|On the rarest of occasions, a movie comes along that reminds us all that cinema, in its purest form, is an art form, a means to express truth and beauty in the most affecting of ways.  Everything is Illuminated is one of these rare films.  It truly is, as has already been said, a metaphysical journey, one that takes the viewer all the way to the very heart of humanity, evoking both its darkest and lightest aspects along the way.<br /><br />As much as I loved this film, I have no doubts whatsoever that some viewers will find it exceedingly boring.  This is a slow, introspective film that unwinds itself slowly onto the viewer's psyche, replete with long dramatic pauses and what I would call deep internal acting.  In other words, a close-up on a character's face can sometimes be more revealing than an extended piece of dialogue.  I imagine that some will also leave the film feeling as if everything wasn't quite illuminated for them.  It would have been a mistake for the scriptwriter to come right out and explain the meaning of everything, though.  True illumination can only come from within.  In addition to that, the emotional reverberations set off by this story would have been stilled by a direct disclosure of its secrets, thereby robbing the film of its greatest strength.<br /><br />Everything is Illuminated could have been less quirky, though - I'll give you that one.  In a way, though, the quirkiness only makes the film more memorable and endearing.  Early on, in particular, it's hard to tell if Elijah Wood's acting is brilliant or awful, as his character is essentially a human automaton with an immovably emotionless face.  Attired in his somber suit of black, he doesn't exactly fit in with the rural Ukrainian population.  His character, Jonathan, has come to the Ukraine in order to learn more about his grandfather and the woman who helped him escape to the West during World War II.  Jonathan is a collector, an anal-retentive packrat who collects all manner of things about people and places - but he has only two items connected to his grandfather.<br /><br />Strangely enough, the film gradually becomes less about Jonathan and more about his tour guides, Alex (Eugene Hutz) and Alex's grumpy grandfather.  Along with the family's temperamental pet dog Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr. (named after Grandfather's favorite singer - and played wonderfully by canine actors Mikki and Mouse), this disparate group of individuals cram themselves into a small car and set off across the Ukrainian countryside in search of a town no one seems to have heard of before.  Many discoveries are to be made on this trip, as the past reasserts itself in some really heart-breaking ways.  That's all I'm going to say about the plot - just trust me when I say it is astonishingly deep and emotionally powerful.<br /><br />Don't get the idea that this is some exceedingly morose film because it does have a number of lighter moments, most of them provided by Alex and his unique translation skills.  The musical score is also a joy to hear, with its delightful mix of Eastern European styles and sounds.  There is no more plaintive or soulful music in the world, and it serves as a powerful complement to the story playing out on screen.<br /><br />In my opinion, Everything is Illuminated is a brilliant film, one of the best I've seen in some time.  Give this movie a chance, and it will touch your heart in ways you may never have experienced before.  Hats off to director Liev Schreiber for bringing such a beautiful, touching film to cinematic life.things about people and places - but he has only two items connected to his grandfather.   <br /> <br />Strangely enough, the film gradually becomes less about Jonathan and more about his tour guides, Alex (Eugene Hutz) and Alex's grumpy grandfather.

0307346609|4.0|World War Z treads where no zombie book has tread before.  It is a bold move from an author who has chosen to examine the entire scope and magnitude of a zombie invasion instead of personalizing it with a single group or individual and their experiences during the initial stages of infection on through to utter annihilation.<br /><br />Certainly, this book does personalize the war of humanity vs. zombies by telling the individual story of key players in the conflict.  From the doctor who sees one of the first cases of infection to the politicians involved in the pre-war failings of most governments to the troops on the battlefield, this book covers a huge amount of ground and does so from beginning to end.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the vivid details brought out by the diversity of perspectives.  How zombies work, how they react, but more importantly, how we react to them.  The cold harsh decisions that would have to be made so that humanity could first survive, hold the lines, and finally turn the tide in the most epic struggle that mankind had ever seen in its history.<br /><br />My main criticisms of many of the zombie works I have seen, if there is to be any, are the fact that humanity usually fails monumentally and in essence is completely wiped out.  There is little hope and usually our failings can be seen with the characters that inhabit these stories on a smaller scale.  Humanity rarely shows what has made us the top level animals on this planet when the zombies show their faces.  Another complaint I would have with most of the stories is that they usually cut off just when things are getting good.  I am always very interested in finding out what is next for the characters, but I left to ponder if they will survive or be obliterated.<br /><br />In so many stories told, you are almost rooting for the zombies, at least against certain characters.  We see humanity at its ugliest and when those evildoers get chomped it seems like twisted justice.  Not so in this tale.  I wanted to finally see someone who would dive in and show how humanity would face down and defeat its greatest enemy and in that, this story did not disappoint.  Down, but not out, we overcome and triumph in the end.  It is at great cost on so many levels, but humanity comes out triumphant in the end.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent story.  Max Brooks provides such depth to the tactics needed and hard decisions that would have to be made.  His alternate universe is extremely well fleshed out and it felt like a very thorough history lesson rather than a piece of fiction.  I believe that the author did a tremendous amount research in putting this all together.  So much of it felt so very real.<br /><br />The area of criticism I have has been pointed out by others here.  I do not feel as strongly as they do that it has tainted this work.  Our narrator states at the outset that he did his best to keep his own commentary limited to questions and not an analysis or judgement of those he is speaking to; he shall remain neutral and apolitical in his reporting.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with the author, who very much politicized this work of fiction.  With that said, I am not sure something of this scope could have avoided such efforts.  Not only would it be necessary for zombies to exist for humanity to be in danger of extinction, but there would have to be monumental failings of goverments the world over.  Societies would have to crumble and self destruct.  Otherwise, a zombie invasion would stall at one point or another.  The author facilitates full blown Apocalyptic mayhem by making not only the United States government make tremendous errors in judgement, but nearly every other government on the planet.  Thus I can pass over what appears to be some very particular and pointed comments by the interviewed characters in the book that seem to reinforce a certain political leaning of the author.<br /><br />In reality, most high quality zombie tales have some sort of political undercurrent to them.  Romero invented the modern day zombie and in each of his movies he skewers our society and/or our government with what he percieves to be their failings.  Zombies tend to lend themselves to this sort of efforts.  I believe at the heart of it, that is what makes zombies so potent in so many stories: they serve not only as tools of terror, but to show us how weak or strong that we as individuals and as a race, can be.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent and inciteful work that was extremely enjoyable to read.high quality zombie tales have some sort of political undercurrent to them.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|but i sure do love her music. also, i think it's unfair that people put prince, michael jackson over madonna when it comes to musical credit. none of those contemporary musicians have that kind of imaginative lyrics, beautiful and intuitive melody and that kind of bravity madonna has to bring forward with her music. at core, the good, solid and class music madonna makes is what keeps her going. i mean, who can remember what number one songs mariah carey has but sure know madonna's numerous no.2 classic songs.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|STAR WARS is a cinematic and cultural phenomenon.  It has a winning combination of action, strong characters, and humor mixed with a spiritual message.  At once borrowing from other films and Saturday matinee serials, STAR WARS also has inspired thousands of films since its release.  This film made Dolby Stereo the dominant sound format in cinema and redefined what a blockbuster film would be.  Its groundbreaking visual effects won Academy Awards for their creators and paved the way for most special-effects films that followed. <br /> <br /> The first disk is essentially the same as the DVD released in 2004.  The original visual effects have been replaced with computer generated ones without much impact on the film's entertainment value or structure.  The soundtrack has been mixed for Dolby 5.1 with minor additions made to the soundtrack.  Extended footage of dewbacks, the Mos Eisley Spaceport, and Jabba the Hutt extend the length of the film without enhancing it.  However, the modification of several scenes, especially Han Solo's introduction, deprives the film of a character arc and detracts from the special edition. <br /> <br /> The only reason to buy this DVD is for the \\"bonus material\\" of the original version of the film.  After thirty years my memory may be faulty, but I recall the film having different opening title cards and closing credits from the ones shown in this DVD.  As reported, this DVD is not anamorphic and is based mostly on a previous video transfer of the film.  The picture is better than I was expecting on a wide-screen, high definition television set.  Unfortunately, the subtitles for the scene of Han Solo are cropped off the bottom of a wide-screen television when the picture is expanded to fill the screen.  The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack is lackluster. <br /> <br /> Those with standard definition television sets should have no hesitance in purchasing this DVD for its \\"bonus material.\\"  Watching it on a high-definition television involves trade-offs that would have been avoided with a typical anamorphic DVD.  Because of the character changes made in the special edition, the original film is the better film.  Film buffs should appreciate seeing what cutting-edge visual effects were in 1977.  However, first-time viewers may prefer the more state-of-the-art special edition. <br />
B000FQJAIW|5.0|the star wars saga comes home...again <br /> <br />first in 1992  lucasfilm released the  star wars trilogy on limited edition vhs and laser disc the tagline was \\" the original trilogy..one last time\\"    but i knew  that wasnt so, then comes the 1997 star wars trilogy special editions in the theaters(and later on video )  it was a great time to be a star wars fan  then  came the prequel trilogy  excellent!!.. jump to september 2004  the special editions are finally released onto dvd...and they were worth the wait.. then shortly after that they release a box set of just the stripped down dvd set of the special editions  ... i have all these versions except the stripped down version  i saw that pointless    go figure...  just having the star wars films became a collection of sorts LOL     i even have the  laser disc  versions  as well as  my original beta formats(those are collectors items )   <br /> <br />theres no excuse not to  have the star wars films in your collection anymore ! and we also know they will come on blu ray  sometime also.. <br /> <br />jump to 2006,  in the words of threepio  \\"here we go again\\"  it seems one of the parts of being a star wars fan is having to buy, every few years a new version of the film..which is not uncommon with hollywood studios these days <br /> <br />dont get me wrong.. im not ragging on this release unlike a lot of people here on amazon are...but   we already know lucas will release a special box set of all 6 films with new added footage etc    there was a lot of material left on the cutting room floor such as the biggs/luke scenes from episode IV .. and there was also a lot of material cut from episodes I,II III, V, and IV..lots to look forward to.. <br /> <br /> lucasfilm  now gives us the star wars trilogy  dvds sold seperatly with  this version has the 2004 special edition release dvd and for the bonus dvd  because of overwhelming fan requests(myself included)..THE original 1977 release of star wars ..a new hope...but wait  empire and jedi are out also with their original versions as well... at first,i wasnt sure if i was going to get any of these releases.   <br /> <br /> a few nights ago, my dvd of episode 4 got messed up, so i got a copy of this release.the special edition is the same  so that no problem...but to have the classic version we grew up with  on dvd is worth the price!..  i loved seeing the scene where han solo shoots greedo first in the cantima...that was a defining moment for the character...and i did not like the idea that they changed it for the special edition..hans shifting  to avoid greedo's blast never looked natural..it looks jerky at best.. <br /> <br />but to be honest, its great to have the original on dvd  the video is of  good quality  ..lucasfilm said they took the original versions from the laser disc  masters for the dvd production..and they did a good job  it looks cleaned up..but  you have to wonder did they tweak it a bit here and there ...some scenes i was saying to myself..that was added for the special edition.. and its fun to speculate  but you have to have a good eye for that kind of thing...Lucas always likes to tinker with his films.. and thats a double edged sword.. <br /> <br />if you never bought the special editions when they came out in 2004..grab this set..you get both versions...its a bargin...the only thing i did not like was the fact there was no  documentaries for the  original version ..it would have been nice to see a message from  lucas to  the fans about this release..we have been waiting years for the originals to  be put onto dvd..  thank you george! <br /> <br />to the people saying that this version was rushed, and put out just for quick cash..i say dont breath too much into this...just sit back ,relax, and  enjoy ...i remember seeing episode IV opening night in 1977..i was 5 years old..this brings back fond memories.. <br /> <br /> Im  looking forward to seeing the new  clone wars series and the proposed live action tv series (star trek watch out)  but more importantly..when will we  get to see episodes 7,8,and 9 ?? ...theres so much story to continue with.. because i remember reading a article   after return of the jedi came out..that lucas said there will be no more star wars films  then years later  came episode 1   you have to keep the faith   <br />  may the  force be with you
067101756X|5.0|This is an excellent book. Mr. Corso's experience as a nuclear defense commander, white house National security advisor to Pres. Eisenhower for 4 years, then assigned to the Pentagon in the Army R&D division and then as National security advisor to 2 senators makes him a highly reputable and credible source.<br /><br />In addition to the reverse engineering of Roswell craft technology (which most of us working in the telcom industry already knew for decades that Bell Labs had reverse engineered several \\"inventions\\"), Corso also had additional fascinating information on the cold war as well as the discovery of alien bases on the moon during the first orbital photo imagery ever taken.<br /><br />I decided to check on his desciption of bases on the moon. I went to the Navy's own website displaying satellite images of the moon from their Clementine satellite and looked for myself. Just like Corso descibed, there are indeed buildings, ore mining operations and craft on a massive scale on the moon which can clearly be seen on the satellite images. On some, the Navy tried to smudge out the buildings, but you can still see what they were. Others, they missed entirely. Don't take anyone's word for it. Look for yourself.<br /><br />I have nothing but the highest level of praise for Phillip Corso and his honest and revealing book. I wish we could thank him for his bravery in coming forward with the truth.<br /><br />If you want the real truth, don't listen to the critics. Read his book and then check out the moon images on the Navy's own website. Once you find the objects at the extreme north and south lunar poles, you will know for certain that Corso was telling the truth.
0553582461|5.0|I'm not really going to give a plot synopsis, because it won't mean what it should unless you have read the Assassin's trilogy and the other two books in Tawny man.  If you havn't read them, I seriously suggest getting to those first because this story is one worth while.  Right up there with wheel of time, and if only they could have lasted just as long.     <br /> <br />I was a bit apprehensive when I first picked up Assassin's Apprentice.  The setting seemed a little more midieval than I cared for, but once I started reading, I havn't put it down, and havn't put any of the books down till I finished Fool's Fate this morning.    <br /> <br />Fitz is a character that sticks with you.  There were definately times when I started yelling \\"oh no\\" over and over again when certain things happened in Fool's fate, because after everything he has gone through, he has a hell of a lot more yet to go. <br /> <br />Basic points - Nettle is way more involved in this.  The relationship between Elliana and Dutiful follows the predictable path.  Something horrible happens to the Fool that almost made me cry and made my heart hurt nad you meet one of his Kin.  You learn quite a bit more about dragons.  Anything I say about Fitz would ruin the book, cept that he loses someone close to him.
B000G8NXZK|5.0|Now that this prevalent film has been upgraded to a beautiful anamorphic transfer it means that this DVD set is one of the best out there, if not THE best.  Although the previous transfer was quite good, the  remastered transfer is a big improvement.  It's crisp, sharp, the colors pop like never before, and it's so clear that I could make out extra fine details that I previously didn't know existed.  For a film as meticulously detailed as this, the presentation is quite vital.  And since it's one of my favorite films, it's worth the upgrade for me. <br /> <br />The entire 3-disc set is really well organzied and thought out and truly guides you through the wild and wonderful imagination of director Terry Gilliam.  You get a super director's commentary, art design galleries, documentaries, a horribly recut studio variation, etc.--by the end of it, you'll undertand just what Mr. Gilliam went through to bring \\"Brazil\\", his masterpiece, to the screen.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Silent Hill is a hard movie to categorize.  I say this because it was not exactly terrifying, like a horror movie should be.  It was not logical in the slightest way, but I didn't mind.  The dark charm of this film is in its dream-like effect.  It literally reminded me of the types of dreams or nightmares that I remember in vivid detail the next morning.  Not the recurring dreams, but the once-in-a-lifetime I wish I could have somehow wired a DVD burner to my brain and recorded this wonderfully sureal and dark vision for repeat viewings.  This is the first film that I feel captures this effect. <br /> <br />This eventually changes as the film tries to explain itself about two-thirds of the way through.  I would have preferred something that was actually more abstract in place of these exposition scenes.  If Silent Hill had continued to present more of the sureal and bizarre, then the film would have been better.  What really redeemed it for me was the wonderfully open-ended and somber last scene. <br /> <br />The director of Silent Hill also did a film called The Brotherhood of the Wolf.  If you haven't seen that, then I recommend seeing it first, then watching Silent Hill.  I think that it will prime you for Silent Hill, even though it is very different. <br /> <br />Other dream-like films to check out are anything by: David Cronenberg, David Lynch, The Cell, The City of Lost Children, Dark City, Jacob's Ladder, and Akira Kurosawa's Dreams.
1400044162|5.0|In the late 1960s civil war devastates the Igbo people who formed the independent nation of Biafra having broken away from Nigeria.  Thirteen year old peasant Ugwu has survived so far even being forcfully conscripted into the shabby Biafran army; currently he works as a houseboy for Professor Odenigbo.<br /><br />At the same time the lad endures life and death, a savage slaughter of the affluent leaves twin sisters Olanna and Kainene without any other family member left alive.  Both choose similar paths to safety; the only ones available to young orphaned females.  Olanna becomes mistress to Professor Odenigbo, who loathes the Europeans for what their occupation has wrought to his homeland; Kainene, on the other hands, selects British writer Richard, who is writing a book on the civil war impact on the Igbo, as her protector.  Ugwu and Kainene form a relationship, but she becomes outraged when he spends a drunken night with her twin, putting all three at risk.<br /><br />Readers will feel and \\"see\\" the impact of war on the innocent in this superior historical novel.  Using the Biafra civil war of the 1960s as the influence that directly impacts her three prime characters and to a lesser degree the two support players, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie paints a vivid condemnation of war in which peasants below the frey easily become collateral damage and survivability is everything.  Readers (except VP Cheney, who would find a connection to 9/11) will appreciate this powerful look at real world surviving.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000BYCAJE|1.0|One would wonder, what's happening to Rhino? What happened to the so called \\"hand made records\\" that made us think who else by Rhino could've done? In my opinion, they are losing it. I'm not the first one to complain. Read the critics on the Talking Head's Brick Box Set and you'll know what I'm talkin' about. This particular release not only doesn't improve a bit the sound of the late 90's remaster version of this outstanding album, but actually has so many problems that makes even the non-remaster version superior. An to make you even more confuse about the \\"remaster crase\\" of the last years, this release is claim to be in HDCD. Well, if they say so, it's fine for me, but I couldn't tell the difference. The bonus tracks are fine, but it's too much money for so little return. Rhino is having problems. I can tell. I've always been one of their biggest fans and I have most of its greatest releases from the past years, including the two Grateful Dead Box Sets. What a marvellous job they did on that release. That's absolutely not the case here. Avoid it.
B000G759LW|2.0|What a shame.  A wonderfully talented young woman with the most outstanding female voice in pop music today, and she still hasn't figured it out.  I don't want to listen to an album filled with lyrics - some explicit - about sex.  Whatever happened to songs that had meaning and could move you like \\"Hurt\\"?  This is perhaps the best song on the album because it showcases Christina's awesome voice, and the lyrics are powerful enough to move anyone to tears.   <br /> <br />I'm begging today's pop artists to cut the sex talk and get back to real music and lyrics!
B00092ZL80|5.0|To say that this DVD is awesome is a gross injustice.  What a fantastic combination!  I have enjoyed both Chicago and Earth Wind and Fire for years.  Never did I realize how much they had in common.  Chicago still can crank it out.  Earth, Wind and Fire - what do you say to such energy - they still rock. <br /> <br />So if you are sitting there thinking - would I enjoy this - my answer to that is - Just buy it cause you will!!! <br /> <br />You will Sing a Song and be Alive Again!  Chicago and Earth, Wind and Fire are a Hard Habit to Break.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This album has it all - it's very bluesy, and the r & b tracks are good.  Dreaming With a Broken Heart is especially great.  It seems to be an album about breaking up and love, so it's perfect for anyone working through that.  It's really fantastic, by far my best music purchase in a while.
0743424425|4.0|This book is an excellent thriller that is very well written and moves at a swift pace. While the character development of the Overlook's caretaker and family are intense, it is the hotel itself that steals the show as the true terror. Stephen King's writing will keep you up at night and engaged to the end. <br /> <br />For fans of Stanley Kubrick's film, the book will add a lot of depth about the history of the Overlook and the mindset of the caretaker. Even if you didn't like the movie, it is different enough to be worth taking the chance.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I was debating on whether or not to submit my review of this album but the more I listened to his album repeatedly in the confines of my car on the way to and from work...the more I felt compelled to do so.  I have been a fan of John Mayer for several years and have come to respect him as an amazing lyricist and a truly moving blues guitarist.  He is a musician in the true sense of the word.  He lives, breathes and eats music and that is very clear.  His previous albums have been very good but I found myself intermittently saying \\"wow\\" while listening to this album.  <br />  <br />What strikes me about this album is knowing that you are listening to the vocal and instrumental representation of his heart and soul.  There is a real intimacy in that.  The candor of his lyrics, better or worse, is just one of the things that makes him standout from the rest and he again does not disappoint on this album.  He is truly frank and sincere on this album....sometimes painfully so and in this you find the human connection to some of the common life experiences that we all share.   <br /> <br />Standout tracks for me (they are all really good): <br />Gravity - I loved this song immediately from the John Mayer Trio album.   <br />The Heart of Life - An inspiring gem.   <br />Stop This Train - Speaks to the fear and reservations a lot of us have in regards to growing into adulthood and dealing with all that comes with that.  <br />Slow Dancing in a Burning Room - The title alone tells you that this will be a marvelous song.   <br />Dreaming with a Broken Heart - Beautiful and Poetic.   <br /> <br />So with all that said, I had to give the album 5 stars and I am not one of those people that just hands out 5 stars here and there.  There are literally a handful of people whose albums I would say deserve 5 stars.  I am like one of those professors that tells you on the first day of class that they do not hand out A's.  In this case, I handed out an A and threw in a plus sign next tothe A because it is just that impressive.  Enjoy!!!
B000HC2LIK|5.0|In many ways, Ridley Scott's films remind me of Brian de Palma's: many people consider him a filmmaking icon, a notable director among the many many other ones making good or bad films. Sure de Palma has his Scarface and his Untouchables but don't forget he also had the forgettable Snake Eyes and Mission to Mars. Ridley Scott meanwhile has Alien and Gladiator(overrated personally) but he does have White Squall and 1692 but chalk Blade Runner up in his more memorable films has its probably one of the better made sci-fi films of the 80's. <br /> <br />It's 2017 and mankind has developed Replicants, humanoids who look very similar to humans and used for degrading work. After they decide to revolt, humans start making specialists - blade runners - to \\"retire\\" the replicants, in other words, kill. They bring in Deckard, a retired blade runner, to track down replicants who recently escaped all the while falling in love with one. <br /> <br />A lot of futuristic films seem to be very ambitious where the technology reaches a point where anything's possible. Interstellar travel, flying cars, sophisticated ID systems and holographs are very present in these kind of films but oddly, Blade Runner doesn't have as much. While it does have some scenes involving flying cars going over neon-lit cities and a woman's face on a building, when we're on ground level the technology isn't as apparent. It helps the film feel real and plausible without looking too ambitious for its own good. <br /> <br />It's interesting to note that although the film is considered a sci-fi film, it's kind of light on action scenes. It's not that big of a deal but when you look at the main cover art, Deckard with gun in hand, but people thinking this is going to be a slam-bang action film by Ridley Scott might be disappointed. I was surely expecting it but seeing the film, as good as it was, I was like \\"wow, not a lot of fast parts\\". Then again, Alien had deliberate pacing so I guess it's to be expected. <br/> <br />For those of you wondering, this isn't the super deluxe edition where we have different versions of the film(that's in 2007), so with this one we only get the remastered version of the film with a better transfer. So if you want to replace your crappy original director's cut version with horrible main menu and crappy transfer, go ahead but if you want more bang for your 30 to 40$ whatever it will be come up to, wait till 2007.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|The trailers for this film made it look really, really creepy.  Unfortunately, all of those creepy moments in the trailers are the only creepy moments in this film.  \\"Silent Hill,\\" based on a videogame series I've never played before, tells us the story of Rose, a mother who is trying to come to terms with the sleepwalking and nightmarish fits of her daughter, Sharon.  Sharon constantly speaks of Silent Hill in her fits, so Rose tracks the actual place down and takes her there against the will of her husband, Chris.<br /><br />Pursued by a policewoman while trying to get to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon are involved in a car accident.  When Rose awakes, Sharon has vanished and the cop is attempting to arrest her.  When Rose and the policewoman encounter a \\"thing\\" outside of Silent Hill, Rose uses the distraction to escape from the officer and seek out her daughter in the creepy, fallout-looking town of Silent Hill.  We are slowly lead around the town for what seems like an eternity.  We are intentionally denied specifics in an attempt to build both suspense and confusion.  Rose begins chasing another young girl in the town who she believes can lead her to her daughter.  Along the way, Rose and the cop befriend each other and they join together in a battle against supernatural forces and mutant-like creatures in order to save Sharon.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rose's husband is desperately trying to find his wife and daughter.  He, along with a suspicious cop, scourge the same Silent Hill looking for his family, but instead of the gray, misty version of the town that Rose is trapped in, Chris is simply in a deserted town.  This is the first tip-off that Silent Hill might be operating on two separate planes of reality.<br /><br />Confusing, dull, lacking in any real interesting characters, \\"Silent Hill\\" is obviously meant for the game kids to sit back and enjoy the inside jokes.  I'm disappointed in Sean Bean for agreeing to be in this drivel, he's much better in \\"Equilibrium,\\" \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and the \\"Sharpe's\\" films.  Radha Mitchell also brings little to the table in this bummer.  Director Christophe Gans remembered to bring the atmosphere from his wonderful \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf,\\" but he forgot character development, good action sequences, a credible plot, and some decent scares.  Instead, he got graphic-happy with more CGI blood and guts than you can shake a stick at.<br /><br />If you love the games, I'm guessing you'll enjoy this flick.  However, if you want a legitimate scary flick, look elsewhere.  Also, a better video-game based movie is either of the \\"Resident Evil\\" films.  They have better plots, faster action, and much better baddies.  Oh, and before I'm accused of being a lover of \\"Resident Evil\\" the game, I've never played that either and I still managed to keep up with the storyline.<br /><br />Rent at your own risk.ilibrium,\\" \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and the \\"Sharpe's\\" films.

0596009208|5.0|This is the ultimate book on Java programming. I have very litte programming experience, but needed to know Java for the SCJA exam. I picked up the ExamScam SCJA guide for SCJA topics, and was told to get this book to help me with the syntax. Together these books, along with a book of mock exam questions, got me certified. I totally recommend it. <br /> <br />Not only is the book informative, but it's really funny at times. Someone said this book is a new approach to learning how to code, and I agree. It's a great book!
B00005MP58|5.0|This superb A&E/BBC mini-series is an adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel.  While all Austen novels revolve around the universally acknowledged truth that, \\"a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" her protagonists are always of the fairer sex.  In Pride and Prejudice Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle) supplies that protagonist, and the prejudice.  The pride comes from Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) who finds Elizabeth attractive and intelligent but beneath him.<br /><br />Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  Therefore, no 90 to 120 minute movie can adequately capture the depth of her genius.  That is why I enjoy this two disk, 300 minute, mini-series.  Although the opening scene is not in Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.<br /><br />The cinematography is good but again the genius of Austen was her presentation of the social and family relationships not the milieu.  The Regency era setting was her world and she made no special effort to describe it.<br /><br />I have reviewed three versions of Pride and Prejudice and can recommend both this miniseries and the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley, but for different reasons.  This mini-series is one of the most faithful adaptations of a novel I have ever seen.  For fans of Jane Austen this is a must have for your collection.<br /><br />Kyle Pratt
0596007124|4.0|Patterns are boring. This book makes them fun. How they did it, I'll never know.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Very few soundtracks are actually worth buying i would say. This is truly a wonderful one. it makes you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action, it makes you feel that you can feel the characters, it brings out the best of the movie to you wherever you wanna take it. and you never get bored! go ahead and buy it, no worries there, no regrets later. it is far mi favorite movie, my favorite soundtrack!
B0007OCG56|2.0|I thought that this movie would be pretty interesting. The previews for it made it seem like it was funny. I however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid. The charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground. Also the running time was too long, it says it was just a little over 2 hours, but to me it felt like much more.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|OK, All I have wanted for years now is to see the original Trilogy without flipping a laserdisc.  Now, I have that ability.   <br /> <br />As for the comments on George Lucas's tinkering with his movies, he is not the first to do such things, but he may be the first in this type of medium to be able to do so.  For instance, Samuel Taylor Colridge and W. B. Yeats published different versions of their poems, and never appologized for it.  The rub is that they never tried to de-value their original works either.  They offered alternate versions with updates.  I would like to believe that Lucas is offering that, now. <br /> <br />With that said, the original versions of the Star Wars Trilogy have scars.  People who have been watching Star Wars and living with it as part of their childhood will notice some remaining evidence of tinkering.  A notable one would be the epileptic yellow flashes Lucas put in during the fight between O-B-One and Darth Vader in Star Wars.  It is kind of like having a good friend back after they go off and make some questionable life-decisions.  They are going to have scars, but at least they are the friend you remember and not some weird guy that looks the same but is trying too hard to be himself.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Very well done. The character developments and the shift to different ones across episodes kept it fresh.
B000HR1YHE|5.0|The first and in many ways the best Star Trek episode of all. This is the one that hurdled all the baby boomers into the final frontier. If you only buy one episode make it this one.
B000H305U0|4.0|But, <br />The first time I listened to this album, I was not impressed, I was thinking, I wasted 10 bucks on this. <br />It wasn't until I listed to 'Losing My Way' that I started to appreciate it. <br />Losing My Way is corny, I admit, that but the it's all very catchy, it's like a cross between stan and waterfalls... very catchy pseudo-social commentary. <br />After Forcing myself to go back and listen again, there are some song I can hear being on the radio.  Everyone seems to hat this song, but everything about it is uber catchy... hook, bridge.... it's cool in it's odd little way. <br />Summer Love -is Great, but seeing summer is over, I suspect that it won't be a single. <br />My Love - is nice and airy with a great showcase of that falsetto that makes Justin interesting, and that giggle in the background--you can't tell me that's not meant for Mass consumption. <br />What goes around - is damn catchy, very boy band-ish sounding, but it some how it works.
B000G759LW|4.0|She has a different sound than her previous albums. She jumps around from blues, pop, and r&b. I liked the song F.U.S.S., Oh, Mother, Understand, and Save Me From Myself. Overall, its pretty good.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Up The IRONS!! Maiden is back with there best record since Number Of The Beast!
B000H305U0|1.0|I absolutely cannot STAND Justin Timberlake. His girly voice makes me cringe whenever I hear it, and \\"SexyBack\\", while catchy, gets irritating after a while. Oh, and another thing, \\"JT\\": STOP COPYING MICHAEL JACKSON! MJ may be a freak, but at least he had talent. Don't buy anything from this loser. You'll thank me later.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Ok, I'm a Star Wars fan and so are most of my friends - bottom line here - we aren't complaining!  While I did like some things about the special editions, I also love the old ones for the original music, and just to reminisce of the past.   <br />     These editions are more than you could possibly ask for.  First of all, the originals are finally out! 2nd of all - HDTV, Anamorphic (which is NOT the original aspect of this film), and 5.1 is not needed for these movies! If you want this watch the NEW special editions, and just block the new scenes out and replace them in your mind with the old ones, we've all done it.  <br />     My point goes like this.  It's almost like you all (all = the ones reviewing this edition harshly) are saying that the old version isn't enough like the special editions.   It's old, and it's going to look old.  The only thing you could validly complain about is if there was any  actual downfall from going to DVD format, which there isn't, it  makes it look the best it possibly can.  If you don't want it, don't buy it, and certainly don't complain about it. older movies generally look bad on HDTV, especially old Sci-fi flicks.  George Lucas made these movies didn't he?  is he drugging you to buy them? I don't think so. <br />   My entire point here? get over it!  you don't have to buy these, if you like Star Wars you like Star Wars.  I have these and the 2004 edition of the special edition trilogy.  If you are true Star Wars fans you should be happy that you can buy them in different editions, aren't most Star Wars fans collectors anyway?  I just don't see this as something to complain about. I could understand if he put out a few different versions every few months or something but it's been 2 years since the last main release format. Many things go in and out of print, don't get your panties in a wad cause George is giving you picky people more options.
B000001FI7|5.0|I recently discovered Portishead's music and I am absolutely amazed!  Beth Gibbons voice is almost heavenly in nature and the production throughout \\"Dummy\\" perfectly compliments her soothing vocals.  While not a CD to listen to on a bright, sunny day, \\"Dummy\\" is one of my favorite CD's at the moment and it sets a wonderfully dark mood.  This is trip - hop at its best!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|At first listen I wasn't sold but then I let it sink in that this wasn't 'Train of Thought'. I then realized just how good a record this really is. I saw Dream Theater live on this tour and was completely blown away. Their level of musicianship is just not matched these days. They carry the flame of arena progessive rock into the future with no contemporaries. Octavarium's sound engineering is noticably different from Train of Thought as well. While that was a more in your face mix and agressive sounding, this one is more atmospheric and ambient. There is a slight haze throughout the CD. I guess it's more dream like...ha ha..
B000GFLE1S|4.0|Two heels way up!  Who cares if it was a preposterpous movie, as one reviewer put it.  It was fun, sexy and a feel good movie.  Put your mind in neutral and enjoy the ride.  Yes, predictable, but it was a fun journey seeing where it was going.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Bueller, Ferris Bueller<br /><br />OK, lets start off with what wrong with this edition of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  there are two problem  I see with this new Bueller Bueller DVD edition of Ferris...One is the over use of actor/know it all Ben Stein and the missing director John Hughes's missing audio commentary.<br /><br />Now the good news. There are extras like a few great documentries with most of the cast talking about this movie.<br /><br />And then there is the movie itself-The extras are fine. However the film is a minor classic.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick emits an air of whimsey with a wink of his eye. Broderick's odyseey of adventure isnt lost on his audience. He is part Robert Preston from the Music Man/Part W.C. Fields/Part Robert Wagner from  It Takes a Thief. Broderick playing Ferris is slick, sly and a con man with style. He pokes a stick of his collective eye of Principal Jeffrey (Deadwood) Jones and we are laughing at his antics with enjoyment.<br /><br />The supportive cast of Alan (Spin City) Ruck and Mia Sara makes a sorta lover's triangle without love nor passion..more deeper friendship. The two combined with Broderick makes this film a buddy movie, rather than a TEEN  angst film (like Not another Teen Movies or Ten Things I hate about you)<br /><br />So want to laugh and enjoy the system being poked, get this film<br /><br />and as Ferris would say, \\"What are you Still doing here? Why aren't you buying this yet?\\"<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Simply put, Plant's best album to date. Despite his aging, unlike other classic rock vocalists, Robert's voice seems only to have improved over the past four decades. This album exemplifies Plant's fantastic musicianship. Also, the Strange Sensation is an extraordinarily gifted band, and would have to be, for Robert to choose them to back him up. Both the music and lyrics are exquisite here, and this album definitely deserved to win, though they didn't, the two Grammys for which it was nominated. Both \\"Shine It All Around\\" and \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" were nominated for 2005 Grammy awards. Mighty Rearranger was one of 2005's better rock albums. Here you will find a matured Robert Plant, who knows his current level of musicianship, and concocts a brilliant album by playing up to his capabilities. You will not be dissappointed with this CD. It features some amazing tracks such as, \\"Shine It All Around\\", which displays Plant's amazing vocals regardless of his 56 year-old voice, \\"Tin Pan Valley\\", which is a great hard rocking tune, \\"Brother Ray\\" which kind of reprises the album's tunes at the end, making for an excellent conclusion, \\"Another Tribe\\", which is a fantastic folk song, and \\"Freedom Fries\\", which is a great rock tune that makes a sound statement about America's current situation. Overall, this really is a must-buy album for any fan of contemporary rock, or for any Robert Plant fanatic. Even those who may have disliked the youthful, screeching Plant of the 70's, you may find that you'll like these tunes. I cannot think of any album from the past decade that matches the high level of musicianship to this album. Also, I would recommend getting yourself the Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation's Sound Stage DVD, from their PBS concert. It is a great live perfomance of the album's material, along with some updated versions of old Zeppelin tunes. Purchase yourself Mighty Rearranger, this is one of the greatest albums of all time!!!
B0002NRQTS|5.0|Rush has so many great albums, but when I first heared this album I was shocked. This album has an amazing drum performance by Neil and a great bass performance by Geddy, where as for Alex he is deep in his guitar work on this album, thus also giving him a grand performance. There is a Grunge feel as well as Earthy tone to this album's appearance, when as for the songwriting it is a magical setting in the classic Rush style.  <br />The song of Chain Lightning is a song that deals with immages of Cosmic design and mystical setting, especially when Neil says \\"Reflected in another source of Light, but when the Moment dies, the sparks still Fly in another Pair of eyes\\" in his words, although Geddy sings them. When I first heard that song I thaught that they said \\"Reflected in another source of Life, but when the Mother Dies\\" in that lyric, for I was at the time thinking about the Aname Fairy Tale of Robotech Micross Saga. The idea of the ruins of the SDF 1 being in the middle of a forest long after the ship's distruction, as well as the Flowers that looked so beautiful but were in reallity spawns of death that came from the hull of the ship; gave me the idea of him maybe saying that when one mother plant dies the spawns still fly and then are reborn into another plant, or something like that, but that was never Neil's intention or were those ever his words, for the real lyric was what was mentioned before.  <br />This album has so many great songs besides Chain Lightning, and one of the best examples is The Pass, with the song being dark and it talking about a fallen hero. Again the lyrics made me think about something totally different, for the lyrics begin with \\" Out Sawgger Out of the Schoolyard\\" and I thaught that they said \\" Out Swaggert out of the Schoolyard\\" for the Jimmy Swaggert incodent took place around the time that the album was released, and \\" Christ What Have You Done\\" also gives one that idea. War Paint is my favorate song on the album, and it talks about adolesence and love, at a such young age, and in such a tragic illusion.  <br />This is an album that one must hear and take for ones self into what one fantasizes in dealing with the stories that the Maestro and Poet who is Neil Peart is known to create, as lyrics.
6305078653|1.0|Let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of the fact that it didn't stick with a few key plotlines in the book, everyone still did a great job adapting the original Jurassic Park. Then came this piece of trash... <br /> <br />Whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book, this one just takes the brilliant writing of Michael Chrichton and throws it directly out the window.  <br /> <br />First off, John Hammond is supposed to be dead. He dies at the end of the first novel. Secondly Ian Malcome is supposedly dead, or at least MIA at the end of the first book, and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd. There is no bratty daughter, and the entire premise has much more to it. <br /> <br />MOST IMPORTANTLY... the entire ending in san diego with the T-Rex... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies... did not exist in the book!  <br /> <br />I went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot, a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist, and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off. <br />What I ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page. Not only that... but because of the lack of plot, the dino scenes are complete over-kill. When you see so much of it, you lose that awe and wonder of the first film. When you see that Brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film, the wonderment is difficult to rival. There are no such moments in this film. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino FX, go nuts. However, if you're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline, flick off the dvd player and pick up the book. <br /> <br />Oh and one more thing... don't go NEAR the 3rd movie. They didn't even have a book to be untrue to. I can't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one.
B000FQJAIM|5.0|I attended film school and am certainly familiar with the term Animorphic and I know what animorphic widescreen is , as it pertains to film, projectors and lenses. (Basically,  a rectangular (widescreen) image is squeezed onto a square frame and during projection a special lens is attached to the projector to expand the image to its original width on the screen.<br /><br />What does any of this have to do with my DVD, DVD player or television? None contain a projector, lens, or  70MM print of  STAR WARS.<br /><br />Is \\"animorphic\\" in DVD terms something completely different?<br /><br />IF so it should be called by a different term to avoid confusion.<br /><br />AND what exactly is it?<br /><br />is ANIMOPHIC in DVD something to do with playing the film on a widescreen/ high definition TV?<br /><br />IF so this doesnt matter to me since I own a very sharp video projector with a fine lens and have a wide screen in my living room.<br /><br />It looks about as good as the images i seee projected in movie theatres.<br /><br />so I have no beef.<br /><br />Can anyone explain what animorpic means in terms of DVD.<br /><br />Also, does this version restore C3PO's dialogue  about how to<br /><br />dismantle the tractor beam; It was missing from that last release of the film on VHS/laserdisc.<br /><br />How about the \\"close the blast doors\\" line.<br /><br />If this is really the 77 version, those scenes shoulkd be there>
B000002UAU|5.0|Many music fans today, as well as critics, say that although it may be the most important and influential rock album ever, that 'Sgt. Pepper's' has not aged well and that its psychedelic pretentions don't hold up.  I am NOT one of those people.  To my ears, 'Sgt. Pepper's' remains astonishing, bold and brilliant.  I feel it is a toss-up between this album and 'Revolver' for the Beatles' best recorded work ('Abbey Road' has the best SIDE of an album the Beatles ever recorded in side two, but side one of that album is erratic and uneven - I elaborate on my opinion of that in a separate review).  If you read just about any book on the Beatles, every one admits that the Beatles never operated as a more cohesive and unified unit, literally exploding with ideas in each recording session, than they did on 'Sgt. Pepper's' (in fact, producer George Martin reportedly had a hard time keeping up, yet was thrilled with the results). <br /> <br />And what of the music itself ?  It moves at a breathless pace...each song goes right into the next with confidence, music-hall humor, hidden jokes, innovative asides like whistles, steam organs, dogs barking, orchestras building-up to an enthralling pitch (as on the album's best track, 'A Day in the Life').  Only George Harrison's India-based, mystic influenced \\"Within You, Without You\\" slows the pace down for an examination of chaotic modern life as seen through the eyes of transcedental meditation. <br /> <br />It would be foolish to deny that 'Sgt. Pepper's' revels in psychedelic drug imagery...the Beatles were, by their own admission, taking more drugs (particularly LSD) during the recording of this album than at any other time in their career, and the album spawned the peak of hippie counter-culture and set off the so-called 'Summer of Love'.  But the sad truth is that many of the best rock 'n roll bands make their best music while under the influence of substances (think of the Stones' 'Sticky Fingers' and 'Exile on Main Street', Aerosmith in the 1970's, Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon', etc.).  It doesn't take away from the towering achievement that 'Sgt. Pepper's' is and remains.  What's even more remarkable is that the entire album was recorded on four-track tape...extremely outdated by today's standards, but no modern digital technology existed in 1967, and one has to wonder - how did they condense all of those marvelous sounds and production on four-track recording equipment ? <br /> <br />After this glorious moment, manager Brian Epstein died and Yoko Ono came into John Lennon's life and gradually rendered his interest in the Beatles obsolete, and the band - while continuing to record brilliant music - simply wasn't the same again.  Nevertheless, one only has to listen to this album as well as 'Revolver' and conclude that the years of 1966 and 1967 were truly the Beatles' summit.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The album really showcases the strengths of Anthony, John, Flea, and Chad.<br /><br />Yeah...  I'm just a huge fan through and through...<br /><br />The main reason why I love this album though is because there's so much new sound mixed with so much old sound.  It's like the Chili Peppers are evolving without losing what made us love them in the first place.  And that's a hard thing for a band to do!<br /><br />No, not every song on here is the best song I've ever heard from them but 90% are absolutely terrific and I can't get enough of them!  And that's pretty good considering the other 10% are still quite enjoyable to listen to!<br /><br />If your a big fan or a slight fan of the Chili Peppers this is definitely an album for your music collection...  I have a feeling in years to come, it will be a classic ;)
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Good movie, but to understand it you should have seen the firefly series. That's why I only give it 4 stars. <br />I own firefly all 4 DVDs, and will eventually buy this too. <br />I would compare this to Star trek series.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|Behold, my long silence is broken and I am made whole again once more.  The cunning Lucas has dared strike down that which was immortal.  But when Lucas murdered his fan base his mind touch with mine and all his secrets were made known to me.  I have take from his mind the ultimate plan for the Original Star Wars Trilogy. <br /> <br />1. Lucas declares the original trilogy will never be released on DVD. <br />2. Lucas then proves he is a liar and releases the original trilogy on DVD in poor quality. <br />3. Lucas will then release the original trilogy in anamorphic widescreen <br />4. Lucas will then release the original trilogy in HD DVD <br />5. Lucas will then release the original trilogy in Blue-Ray DVD <br />6. Lucas will then release the original trilogy in Bio-Gel Pack Shiloonean Cartridges. <br />7. Lucas will then release the original trilogy in Krypton Crystalline Fragments. <br /> <br />Lucas will be shown at the end counting all his money.  Actually they should have shown that at the end of the \\"last\\" star wars movie. <br /> <br />As for the DVD...well, the dvds are just like the laserdisc definitive edition quality wise which is nice since I don't have to flip a 12\\" disc every 30 minutes.  Other then that I will wait for each new edition to be released as Lucas has planned in the geometric statistical profit pyramid.   <br /> <br />The profits will be with you Lucas.  Always.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Bought this on Amazon. Enjoyed all the 4 DVDs. I had also seen Serenity DVD separately, but wish I had bought that too. Will buy it soon, just to complete the collection. Mixes science fiction, humor, westerns, superstition etc. <br />Also on my wishlist are the other series by Josh Whedon - Buffy/Angel
B000003CMB|5.0|After recently taking the vinyl LP out after about 15 years of storage, I found that even with all the snaps, crackles and pops, it is still the best recording I have.  But I'm ordering a new recording.  Having two drummers covers up some of the snaps and pops, but not enough.  To me this record is one the few symphonic rock records; only a few bands have been good enough to put this sort of thing together. These players come up with one great melodic and rhythmic piece after another and have wonderful changes in tempo and arrangement.  I got to see them in Tampa Florida many years ago (duh)and even though the venue was designed for basketball, it was the best concert I've heard.  I've read that one or more of the cuts on this recording are actually blends of a couple of pieces from the live concert.  I never noticed that but it will be interesting to get the less edited version.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Seen both the old and new versions.  <br />Compared to the old black and white version, this is so much better.  <br />I rate it 4 starts because it's so scary. I have 2 teenagers - boy/girl and they both got scared by the movie, so I would rate it R. <br />But otherwise, the movie keeps you on edge right through.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I've waited four months, and I still don't have it... I gave you my money, so give me my dvd... But the movie is extra!!
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|I like Shania Twain's songs. This is the second CD of hers that I bought. Of the 21 songs here, 9 are real hits, which I liked. The others are all just ok. So I figure it was better to get the 9 I liked from itunes.
B000G759LW|2.0|How many songs can one person write about their husband?  In Christina's case, almost a whole disc's worth.  Almost every song on the first disc is about her husband.  Couldn't you write about something else?  There are two songs about how she is still dirty.  Please, who cares.  And she doesn't even say she's dirty in a nice way.  If you don't agree with her, then she insults you.  The second disc is remakes of old songs, and songs that belong in another decade.  I don't mind hearing songs like that, but could you mix it up a bit.  What happened to the Christina that made fun songs, and songs that told an important message?  I wish I didn't pay the $18.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|If we look hard enough, we can always find something we don't like about \\"Greatest Hits\\" and \\"Best of\\" releases by our favorite recording artists. Mostly, it's the songs left off or the songs left on, but it can be other things as well. This time I'm not going to let my expectations ruin, what is to me, a perfect \\"Neil Young Greatest Hits\\" cd. The remastering is exquisite, and this is most evident on \\"Needle and the Damage Done\\". It sounds like Neil and his guitar are right in the room. The song selection is perfect, with a nice balance between the acoustic songs and the rockers. The songs are in chronological order, which gives the listener a sense of Young's career history. The album cover is a photo of Neil with an acoustic guitar, from a time in his career that most people probably associate with him. There are no songs after 1992, but rest assured that there will be a GH vol. 2 in the future. I'm a long time fan of Neil Young, and as a concise single cd of his best work, this couldn't be any better.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JNTX|4.0|If the aim of the director was to emulate a comic book, then this is a success. There are no nuances here. Everything works like going from picture frame to picture frame. Even the color and dialog mimics the simplistic style and phrasing from a comic book.<br /><br />The movie is very violent but, this work is adapted from a very violent graphic novel. The violence should not surprise anybody. This is hardly for children.<br /><br />The stories are fun and suspensful. You will root for teh hero and wish nothing but pain for the villains.<br /><br />The best performance is from Micky Rourke playing a very violent thug that also has as soft place in his heart for women. He portrays the toughest SOB I have ever seen in film. I love the electric chair scene.<br /><br />This is a very daring, adventerous yet arty movie that worked, It should not be taken seriously.<br /><br />Other movies tried to be like a comic book (Dick Tracey, Batman, Superman) but this actually accomplishes it. The others are comic book inspired flicks butthis is actually a moving visualization of a comic book.<br /><br />This gets an A+ for the artistic effect and a B+ for the movie content.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Honest people will agree that this is another good Dylan album. Nettie Moore, Workingman's Blues #2, Ain't Talkin' and Standing on the Mountain are very good songs. Beyond the Horizon sounds very chopped up. Did Dylan really cut it live, as he claims, or did some phantom Jack Frost edit this? Its a great album, but he can still step it up. Listen, I know he has a serious travel schedule and that he is 65, can't play guitar anymore due to arthitis, etc. He is a legend, though, and he has to live up to this for as long as decides he wants to. No one wants to hear this, but I would rather be honest.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000H0MKGK|5.0|If you're a John Mayer fan--don't hesitate to buy this album.  Although I still love \\"Room for Squares,\\" Continuum is fantastic.  John Mayer is definitely back!
1594200653|5.0|\\"Postwar - A history of Europe since 1945\\" by Tony Judt is the best book I have read on the subject.  Its perspective on events since 1989 up to 2005 is remarkably good.<br /><br />Only two generations have passed since World War 2, and the risk with a book about this period is that its conclusions and themes may prove to be foolish in the fullness of time.  One is reminded of Mao's response to a question about the consequences of the French Revolution, \\"It is too soon to tell.\\"<br /><br />We can probably be reasonably sure that the history of Europe from the collapse of the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires plus the Soviet upheavals after WW1 to the final territorial and ethnic spasm in the Balkans in the 1990s can probably be written with some certainty, although we still lack access to original source documents for the Soviet role over that period.<br /><br />All books dealing with post-war European history suffer from the fact that limited archival material from the Soviet Union has been available for study.  Historians are forced to rely on sporadic Soviet documents and speeches and the assessments of western diplomats and analysts to interpret Soviet thinking and intentions.<br /><br />The result is that this book (and others) views the history of the Communist world with Western eyes and Western mindsets.  We are denied access to the thoughts, fears and hopes of communist politicians and dissidents and their influence on history.  Hopefully, one day, more archival and other documents will become available to historians and a more balanced history will emerge over time.<br /><br />If I may give another analogy: at present historians writing of the Communist world are peering through the windows of a house trying to understand the lives of the family living there.  They see people going to and fro in the rooms.  Occasionally they get glimpses of what the individuals are reading and writing.  Sometimes a resident will hold up a photo or document for the historian to see.  But the historian cannot hear what they say, nor can he go inside the house to talk to them or inspect their documents, or ask them their views on the outside world.  He can draw conclusions only from what he sees through the windows.<br /><br />A big message from this book is that the recovery and prosperity enjoyed by Western Europe for half a century is due to both the US and the USSR.  The US provided critical economic aid and political support to Europe, including West Germany, because of the threat assumed to be posed by the USSR.  Without such a threat, the US may have retreated into isolationism, leaving the Europeans to sort out the mess.  Without the threat of the USSR, there may not have been the will forgo reparations from Germany and to encourage West Germany to recover.  These were distinct possibilities in the immediate post-war period.<br /><br />The book deals only with the history of Western Europe, with very little explanation of the impact of the rest of the world on that history.  Events and policies in the USSR and USA are covered to the extent that they directly impinged on Europe.  However, Communist and post-colonial developments in Asia and Africa certainly reinforced cold war attitudes in Europe, if they did not directly influence them.<br /><br />What must still be provisional is the history of Europe since say 1990.  Will the European Union and the Euro survive the test of time, or will one or the other go into the dustbin of history?<br /><br />Judt's description of the moribund Soviet economies in the 1970s is the best I have read on the subject. The joke \\"You pretend to work and we pretend to pay you\\" sums up the cynicism and inefficiencies of Eastern bloc economies.<br /><br />His account of the final years of the Eastern Bloc is excellent, as is discussion of the key issues facing Europe in the aftermath of its collapse and the apparent success of free market ideologies.<br /><br />The final chapters of the struggle between socialism (in the form of modern European social capitalism) and capitalist individualism on the US model has yet to be written.  Communism has probably failed for all time, but that does not mean that unrestrained US-style free enterprise will take over Europe.  Beware of historians who proclaim \\"the end of history\\" and the \\"triumph of liberal democratic capitalism\\".  Fortunately, Judt is too sensible to make such hubristic claims, although he does lean towards the European model.<br /><br />Which model of society will \\"win\\" in the course of the 21st Century - the unfettered capitalism of the US, or the social capitalism of the EU?  What is the future of the nation state in the face of the challenges from terrorist extremism?<br /><br />These are important questions, and Judt's book provides the reader with an excellent exposition of the political, social and economic circumstances surrounding them.rs of the struggle between socialism (in the form of modern European social capitalism) and capitalist individualism on the US model has yet to be written.

0895260131|5.0|After reading some of the reviews below I am prone to wonder how many of the frothy critics of this book actually read it. Even from the far left (the ever stalwart supporters of all those who hate America) I hear the droning mantra bewailing the supposed characterization of Islam by the extreme acts of an anomalous few. But Spencer does not make such a characterization. Most of this book does not examine the actions of extremists but instead the tenets of Islam itself. His conclusions are well reasoned and documented; and horrifying! If you have ever wondered why the millions of \\"peace-loving\\" Muslims have not condemned en mass the Jihadists who spew hatred and spill the blood of innocent people all over the world, then get this book and find out. Spencer concludes that violence is a natural outgrowth of the intolerance taught by Islam. Of course, many of us were taught the myth of Muslim tolerance, yet the Quran famously commands any faithful Muslim to \\"Slay the Unbelievers wherever ye find them. Seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them? (Quran 9:5) It is a verse that is not lifted out of context or a rare anomaly or mitigated by the larger body of teaching (as the nonviolent verses of the New Testament clearly abrogate the descriptions of violence contained in the Old Testament) but, is in fact, only one of many such incitements to violence. Spencer believes that such violent leanings are endemic to Islam and explain the complicity of silence we see from the Muslim world when innocents are murdered by Jihadists.<br /><br />Spencer also deals fairly with the perennially festering topic of the Crusades. It is bizarre and questionable that any present day political ideology should be driven by events that took place a thousand years ago. What's more, I wonder why so many Westerners collapse into a guilt coma at the mere mention of the Crusades without asking some important questions. How did the ancient birth place of Christianity, the stomping grounds of the Apostle Paul, St. Augustine, and the incubator that produced the creed most Christians repeat on Sunday mornings become Muslim in the first place? It was the result of Muhammad's war of conquests which lasted almost a thousand years that swallowed the birthplace of Christianity and then stomped out the light that once burned so brightly there. The Crusades were a belated, misguided, and often ignoble response to hundreds of years of Islamic \\"crusades.\\" That march of brutal Islamic imperialism and colonization in the name of Allah ended at the gates of Vienna on a date that should mean something to the world: September 11, 1683. To be a good Muslim is to long for the renewal of that conquest of Europe and the West.<br /><br />Spencer explains many of the draconian and intolerant beliefs of Islam without the incoherent contortions that Islamic apologists give to such issues as the sickening mistreatment of women and girls or the Nazi-like (complete with yellow patches on the clothing) Dhimmi status (a form of slavery) required of Christians and Jews in Muslim lands. Some treatment is also given to Muhammad, who, had he lived today in any western nation would be considered a pedophile due to the fact that his eleventh (and favorite) wife was 6 years old when they married and 9 when the marriage was consummated (the loving husband was 52.) That's really not very much like the historical Jesus, which is one of many examples where the moral equivalency between Christianity and Islam touted by the left crumbles in the light of inconvenient facts. Spencer is required reading for people seeking the truth about Islam and the emerging conflict which will likely define the 21st century.postle Paul, St. Augustine, and the incubator that produced the creed most Christians repeat on Sunday mornings become Muslim in the first place?

Some treatment is also given to Muhammad, who, had he lived today in any western nation would be considered a pedophile due to the fact that his eleventh (and favorite) wife was 6 years old when they married and 9 when the marriage was consummated (the loving husband was 52.) That's really not very much like the historical Jesus, which is one of many examples where the moral equivalency between Christianity and Islam touted by the left crumbles in the light of inconvenient facts. Spencer is required reading for people seeking the truth about Islam and the emerging conflict which will likely define the 21st century.
0974153001|5.0|This book was recommended to me, and I was very pleased to find it all it was hyped up to be.  The book itself is nicely done with color photos, and the artist who authored the book really knew how to explain things so a novice sculptor could \\"get it\\" too.<br /><br />I can see myself refering back to this book many times over the years when I have a question about something I haven't tried before in polymer clay.
B000H305U0|5.0|After one listen on Rhapsody, I had to have a copy of this CD.  The trancy melody on LoveStoned is better than some of the best trace I've heard this year.  I could listen to a remix of this song for hours.  What goes around sounds like another \\"f\\" you Britney song.  The album is as much a Timbaland album as a Justin album though.  But since I'm also a big Timbaland fan, that's OK.  As for those giving this one star.  Haters.
0385504209|4.0|This is arguably one of the best written books I have read.  It strikes the perfect balance between providing enough details to allow the reader to become absorbed without too many details where it becomes boring.  The suspense really never lets up from cover to cover.  Unfortunately, despite protests from religious zealots, this book is rather mild from what it could have been.  It fails to develop anything significant with a promising premise.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The movie itself is one of the all time classic family Christmas movies and should not be missed. <br />I am, however, very disappointed that Amazon has not seen fit to tell the buyer whether or not this film is restored or remastered.

Come on Amazon....provide the proper information so we can decide if this really is a \\"new\\" version or simply one that has been \\"repackaged\\".........we DESERVE more info if you expect us to spend our money.....!!!
B000002UDB|5.0|As a progressive rock fan who happens to have an interest in the genre that extends beyond listening to albums by the major players themselves, e.g. Yes, Genesis, ELP, King Crimson etc., I have started exploring those psychedelic bands that gave rise to the progressive rock style, e.g. The Beatles.  Although the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album (1967) is widely recognized to have laid the groundwork for prog, not to mention providing inspiration for English psychedelic/proto-prog bands such as the Moody Blues, Pink Floyd (debut album only), and even the Nice (debut album only), it is the Beatle's Magical Mystery Tour album (1967) that is a personal favorite.<br /><br />As an editorial comment, my first exposure to the Beatles took place in the late 1970s when my parents bought me the \\"blue album\\" (1967-1970) - on blue vinyl no less.  In fact, many of the songs off of Magical Mystery Tour appeared on that compilation.  One other thing - Magical Mystery Tour was the album that had the famous car crash sound effect and the \\"I buried Paul\\" comment - both of which led the more gullible among us to believe that Paul McCartney had in fact died in a car crash.  I guess it is worth noting that John Lennon in fact said \\"cranberry sauce\\" and not \\"I buried Paul\\", although what is heard on the album sounds a great deal like \\"I buried Paul\\".  In addition to Magical Mystery Tour, various \\"clues\\" perpetuating the urban myth of Paul's death are scattered across several Beatles albums.<br /><br />In terms of the overall feel of the album itself, all of the pieces flow together very nicely so there is a sense of a total \\"program\\".  This was one of the hallmarks of the mature prog rock style in fact - a unifying thread or concept that linked all of the pieces together.  On Magical Mystery Tour, there are instrumental interludes (Flying) and a number of very psychedelic numbers that give the whole album an overwhelmingly psychedelic feel.  Of course, the very colorful and surrealist cover art speaks volumes too and meshes perfectly with the music - reinforcing the link between cover album art (back when it meant something) and the music. Not to forget the most important aspect however, the lyrics are also peppered with cryptic references and surrealist imagery, making this one of the more interesting total packages I have come across lately.<br /><br />In terms of the music, keyboard instruments such as the mellotron are used on a few tracks and duplicate the sounds of flutes and a string section.  Although real strings are used on this album, along with brass instruments, the mellotron had a very distinctive sound and became one of the main instruments in the progressive rock keyboard arsenal.  Various sound effects and studio manipulations are also used, which lend the pieces a somewhat otherworldly feel.  This is especially apparent on some of the electric guitar parts and the vocal sections.  The Beatles of course were absolute masters when it came to melodies and especially vocal harmonies, and they are both used to best effect on tracks like \\"The Fool on the Hill\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", and \\"Hello Goodbye\\" - snippets from these pieces have been bouncing around my head for the past few days.  My favorite tracks include the dark and psychedelic \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", although I do not feel there is a single weak track on this album.<br /><br />Listening to this great music after so many years was a very pleasant experience and reminded me of the significant contribution the Beatles made to popular music in the 20th century and to this very day I suppose (even though I don't listen to current pop music).  It was also very educational in the sense that I understand more about the influence the Beatles had on the progressive rock style that I hold so near and dear.  Although Sgt. Pepper's is certainly the more famous and frequently cited example, I think Magical Mystery Tour certainly holds its own and is a wonderful piece of 1960's psychedelia.  As such, Magical Mystery Tour is very highly recommended along with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967).ece of 1960's psychedelia.  As such, Magical Mystery Tour is very highly recommended along with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967).
0061020710|3.0|Being a great fan of Douglas Adams I hoped that this book would be something along those lines. Even though the humor is there (although not as sophisticated as Adams's), the book was a pain to read. It may be due to the fact that i am not a native english speaker, but i suspect it has more to do with the style of writing.<br />The best way to describe the style is to say it is like listening to a half-drunk friend at a party trying to tell you a truly funny and interesting adventure he/she had been through.
B000002GBJ|5.0|This 1973 debut was the album that my friends and I got excited about in high school.  In fact, with perhaps the single exception of Criminal Record (1977), The Six Wives of Henry VIII stands as Rick's finest solo album.  Apparently, the album reflected his attempt to match up the personalities of the six wives of King Henry the VIII with music.  I do recall reading the descriptions of each wife while listening to the music and occasionally finding little to no relationship - then again, I really did not care too much (it's the thought that counts).  When coupled with his work with Yes, this album stands as a testament to his superior skills as a keyboardist and influenced virtually scores of other keyboardists, most notably Rick van der Linden of the Dutch band Trace.<br /><br />Rick plays no fewer than eight keyboard instruments on this album including a Steinway piano; Hammond C3 organ; pipe organ; RMI electric piano and harpsichord; mini moog synthesizer; A.R.P. synthesizer; and mellotron model 400-D.  He is joined on this album by members of Yes (Alan White - drums; Bill Bruford; drums; Chris Squire - bass; and Steve Howe - guitar).  Unfortunately these guys only play on a few tracks including the opening piece, although Bill only plays on Ann Boleyn.  As you can imagine the opening track is my personal favorite and features Squire, White, and Howe.  The remaining musicians include Strawbs members Chas. Cronk (bass) and Dave Cousins (electric banjo) along with several other bassists, drummers, percussionists, guitarists, and vocalists (a choir including female vocalists with more of a blues/gospel/soul style).  If that last bit caused some panic don't worry - this album is 98% instrumental and the vocal parts work pretty well with the material.  Speaking of which, the playing is excellent and there are some pretty exhilarating moments where Rick rips away on a majestic-sounding pipe organ (Jane Seymour).<br /><br />The music is generally very good and for the most part, this is a great album that features some very classically influenced playing and supremely haunting and brooding melodies (especially on Catherine Howard).  Rick's playing really shines on all of the tracks, although the album is not merely a vehicle for his remarkable skills.  He works in a range of dynamics, moods, tempi, and playing styles, which makes for a very interesting and enjoyable listening experience.  Furthermore, he does a great job integrating the properties of each keyboard into the pieces to accentuate certain moods, e.g. mellotron = sadness etc.<br /><br />Overall this is Rick's finest solo album and is highly recommended to all proggers along with Criminal Record (1977) and all of Rick's work with Yes (yes, Tormato too!).  For those of you that are interested, the band Trace seems to have based their entire approach to prog on The Six Wives... In fact, the albums Trace (1974) and Birds (1975) might prove enjoyable.  By the way, Rick van der Linden (of Trace) is an incredible player and has the same style as Wakeman.is a great album that features some very classically influenced playing and supremely haunting and brooding melodies (especially on Catherine Howard).

B000G8NY4U|5.0|I attended Yanni's concert in Washington, DC.  I have been a Yanni fan for quite a while but being there in person listening AND watching the talent on the stage was incredible.  Another reviewer wrote \\"One played what looked like a hand-crafted wood instrument with strings\\"......this is a hammered dulcimer.  The artist is Dan Landrum from Signal Mountain, Tennessee. He has two recordings and is a touring member of Yanni's core band.  My husband plays the Hammered Dulcimer so I am familiar with it.  I have never seen anyone play it so fast!!! I had the privilage of speaking with Dan after the performance.  (Several musicians always come out and mingle with the attendees - great PR!) <br />I stumbled across the Yanni - Live! DVD  while channel surfing the other night and found our local PBS (Seattle) airing the new DVD.   There were several performances that did not air on PBS but I hope have been captured on the DVD.   All I can say is RUN, don't walk, to get your copy.  It is a spectacular concert!!!    The artistry and respect that these musicians have for their craft and each other is stunning.
B000G73UEU|5.0|After seeing the film, I immediately ordered the soundtrack and have listened to the CD many times over.  Half of the songs hold up to repeat play very well; others get tiresome. I offer this opinion as a different take than many others, including the current spotlight reviewers.  The highlight by far is the \\"Tower of Song,\\" sung on track 1 by Martha Wainwright and again on the final track 16 by Lenonard Cohen himself, accompanied by U2. Listen to these two songs back to back:  Martha's youthful emotional yearning is haunting and Leonard brings his deep voice and older wiser nuance to the lyrics in a slower longer version.  (I disagree with others about U2's Bono--the timbre of his voice contrasts and fits nicely with Leonard's on the stanza in the middle that he sings.) Other songs that wear well over repeated play: If It Be Your Will, Antony; I Can't Forget, Jarvis Cocker; The Traitor, Martha Wainwright; Suzanne, Nick Cave et al; The Future, Teddy Thompson.  On the other hand, Rufus Wainwright gets tiresome (too one-note, especially on Everybody Knows--I liked the timbre of his voice a lot at first, but have cancelled plans to buy one of his CDs); others I have to skip over now include Thompson, Tonight Will Be Fine; M. Wainwright and McGarrigles, Winter Lady (poor rendition); and The Handsome Family, Famous Blue Raincoat.  All in all though, great music.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Fans have been clammoring for the original versions of the Star Wars films to be released on DVD since the dawning of the format.  Finally, we have these films.  Sure, this is not anamorpic widescreen or a new transfer from the master print of the film, but it looks damned good on my circa 1995 standard def TV set.  Now, I can understand the backlash against this from those who have state of the art equipment, because when I threw the disc into my 17\\" Powerbook, the image was less than stellar...extremely grainy.  I'm sure this is how the film is going to look on the best home theatre set-ups today.  However, I generally don't watch movies on my laptop, and, like I said earlier, this disc looks great on my TV set.  Crystal clear.  Just as a comparison, I threw my \\"Faces\\" laserdisc and my \\"Special Widescreen Edition\\" laserdisc in to my LD player and noticed that this DVD is leaps and bounds above the laserdiscs, which means that no matter what bootleg you have that was made from a transfer of the laserdisc, this is going to be better just because the source material is better (laserdisc master rather than laserdisc). <br /> <br />So, it's a matter of what equipment you have really.  If you don't have the best TV set and home theatre system (like myself) and you want the original Star Wars, the way you saw it when you were a kid, then buy these discs.  If you do have some of the better equipment, you may want to avoid.  For me, this is good enough for now, and I am extremely happy with being able to watch what looks like a crystal clear copy of the film for the first time ever.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is a great overall effort by John Mayer.  The album has a very nice blues feel mixed in with his signature sound.  It is good to see Mayer maturing with every album.  Vultures is my favorite track, but almost all are memorable.  Also of note is unlike most Rock/Pop albums, this one has *great* audio engineering...  The album is as close to audiophile quality as you can get in a popular release from a major label.  Good stuff.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Finally good 'old' Star Wars on DVD! With the original crawl, matte lines and REAL models! This film and it's sequals required artistry, not just programming skill. <br /> <br />Some people have complained about the DOLBY STEREO isn't digital... They didn't have digital surround sound in the 70s and 80s! <br /> <br />Changing films after they are released is just as bad as colorizing films... Just because something looks better (and sounds better) doesn't make it better. <br /> <br />I thought the burning of Atlanta at the end of GONE WITH THE WIND was too short. It was shot too close, so you can't see enough of Atlanta. Why not add another twenty minutes with nice CGI buildings and slowly pull in to the original footage... That would be cool! <br /> <br />Why is that wrong? It is a film classic. It was a huge hit years ago because it was well done... Why change it?
B000H305U0|4.0|At first I didn't like Sexyback, but it grew on me.  I do love \\"My Love\\" (without the intro).  He like other artists (Cher, Madonna, et al) are trying to hide from their earlier hits.  Trust me in 10 years he will be re-singing the NSync songs as they got him to where he is today.  I like his spin on hip hop as long as he keeps the rapping out of it.  This is not too bad, but I think he is trying to be something that he isn't by jumping on the latest bandwagon versus just showcasing his own style.  I bought it anyway.  If there are at least 3 or 4 songs that I love then it was worth the purchase.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I would have written a review for this album sooner, but I was too busy listening.  It will be hard to top this record.  Every song is absolutely amazing.  I haven't heard a record with this much mood since Pink Floyd's \\"dark side of the moon\\", I truely believe this record will hold its place with phenomenal albums such as the above mentioned.  FIX YOU, has a special place in my heart and will until the day I die. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Very rarely will I come across a cd with songs aside from the single(s) worth listening to. This is ONE of the few!<br /><br />Franz Ferdinand were named for the Austro-Hungarian Archduke whose murder sparked World War I. With the success of their single \\"Take Me Out,\\" they were propelled to the mainstream where they won an MTV Music Video Award for \\"Take Me Out\\" as well as the U.K. Mercury Prize.<br /><br />Their second single released here in the U.S., \\"This Fire,\\" also became a sizeable modern rock hit. Some of my personal favorites include: \\"Jacqueline\\" / \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" / \\"The Dark Of The Matinee\\" / \\"40'\\"<br /><br />Overall, I give this album a perfect score. Very original, post-modern pop rock. Impossible to listen to without bobbing your head or dancing to!
B000H5U65C|5.0|<br />For the first time in years I'm unable to form the words neccessary to give this a review. I'm unable to put into words its magnificence. Exquiste ear candy for metal fans that demand more from their music.  <br /> <br />Mastodon's evolution is nothing short of phenomenal.  <br /> <br />What a useless gushing review this is. If it serves any purpose let me just say that if you liked Mastodon before, kneel before your new God - Blood Moutain. <br />
0671015206|5.0|Before reading \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\", I had simple beliefs such as the guy who drove a BMW or a Lexus was the \\"rich\\" guy and the guy who drove a beat-up Ford 150 was the \\"poor\\" guy.  Or the guy who managed to take his family out to dinner was the \\"rich\\" guy and the guy who stayed in to eat was the \\"poor\\" sap.  After reading this book, it changed my point of view completely.... <br /> <br />I had read this book about 7 years ago and I have been recommending this book for just as long.  The book will convince any reader that the simple truth is \\"It doesn't matter how much you make, it's how much you save.\\"  This one book alone has taught me that people who save, budget and plan are ones that become financially successful. <br /> <br />The book takes case studies of individuals and explains how they have became millionaires.  One thing that struck me is that most of the millionaires live like regular people, they don't try to live the excessive lifestyles.  For examples, the authors in this book held a conference with several millionaires and they figured that these millionaires would eat fancy foods.  Instead, most of the millionaires were hankering foods such as hot dogs, chips and pizza.  Very telling.... <br /> <br />There are those who play \\"millionaires\\" and there are those who are \\"millionaires\\".  If you want to learn the basic steps in order to become a \\"millionaire\\", this book will teach you invaluable lessons.  (And no ... you don't have to buy that Mercedes in order to know you are rich!)

B000059XUO|5.0|This is an incredible action movie by any standard. It captures ugly acts by ugly people in an ugly city in the rain - but does it beautifully.<br /><br />The plot may not be anything grand, based on supernatural vengeance for a vicious murder. It's played out in a spectacular way, though, set against a combination of crumbling Victorian and 90s grunge in a city that seems never to see daylight. The crow itself is never wholly explained but never far away, giving a pervasive sense of mystery to the movie. Police sergeant Albrecht brings some sense of justice to the vengeance, and little Sarah reminds us of what needs to be avenged. Rochelle Davis, aged 14 when she played the role, put in a truly memorable performance. She managed to convey everything sulky and rebellious in a teen of her actual age, along with the strength of the young woman and fragility of the little girl that combine in her one small person. She never acted again after this movie - understandable, given the tragedy of its production - and I am sure that cinema lost something valuable because of that.<br /><br />One scene showed Sarah playing an LP album, reminding me that this movie predates today's pervasiveness of CDs. It also predates most of the computer-driven effects seen routinely in today's movies. Don't get me wrong, I'm as big an effects nut as anyone. The movie, though, is a stark and strong reminder of how good a movie can be without that kind of enhancement.<br /><br />If movies adapted from comics put you off, I have to agree that you have lots of good reason for that feeling. Give this one a chance anyway. The fact that some other adaptations have been really bad doesn't change the fact that this movie, adaptation or not, is really good.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0000AUHPG|5.0|There hasn't been a film that has had such a profound effect on me as 'Once Upon a Time in The West' has. There hasn't been a film that has moved me, or flat out touched me the way this has. It's nearly three hours long and it doesn't feel like it. We are treated with top notch direction by the great Sergio Leone. He mesmerizes us with his camera angles, breathtaking visuals, and gets the best out of his actors. Henry Fonda has never been more menacing and cold-blooded. Charles Bronson is at his absolute best. Jason Robards was outstanding. Claudia Cardinale has never been more beautiful. We are also treated to a haunting score by the one and only, Ennio Morricone. This is arguably the best music score of all-time. It will send chills up your spine. If you're a fan of good old-fashioned movie-making, 'Once Upon a Time in The West' is the film for you. Go buy it!
B00003CWPR|3.0|This was the film that ended a marriage.  I am awed by the audacity of Kubrick and the couple to go through with such an immoral project.  He was totally ineffective as a licensed MD, though whatever ID he used got him the info he needed and in some doors.  At the Verona Restaurant he order \\"Cappaccinno, please,\\" then got more than he expected.  The piano was eerie outside the restaurant and later at home.  He had been followed from the newsstand to the morgue where he saw the body of the woman who saved him at the strange ceremony. <br /> <br />It was staged, fake, a charade just like that one in Young Sherlock Holmes and the new Dragnet.  Do people really do such strange things.  It was for your own good.  Make-believe reality is just a dream.  Somebody died, but that happens all the time.  Life goes on, until it doesn't.  That kind of life style was unbelieavle for someone who lives in Tennessee, but perhaps New Yorkers and those in Los Angeles have their kicks dressing up and acting like long ago and far away. <br /> <br />Finally, I have found Bill and I have looked for years.  I don't remember that he had such a large nose.  Was it real or only a dream?  One night can haunt a lifetime.  We're awake now.  The ending is the same as the beginning only she doesn't know what she is asking for this time or the danger involved. <br /> <br />Now we know why he went on a downhill spiral and why he acted as he did during the past year.  May God forgive him.
B00005JOVN|4.0|Okay. I LIKED Poseidon. No, it does not come near to the excitement of the original, but if the original had never been made, this would have seemed like a perfectly good movie. I liked the way the characters worked together, with sometimes one character taking the lead and sometimes another character taking the lead. it was a pleasant change from the pissing contests that so often occur in these disaster flicks. Although there were undercurrents of tension between Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas, those pretty much disappear when the action hits. And yes, Russell's overprotectiveness of his daughter, Emmy Rossum, does get to be a little annoying, but when all is said and done, it really doesn't matter. If anything, I think the movie could stand to have been a bit longer, but I enjoyed it as it was.
B00005JP8V|1.0|This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever seen at the theaters.  The Mummy was bad, but this one was much worse!  Witch boys flying around in a black SUV?  Oooohhh, scary!  What the hell is a darkling anyway?  The acting was horrible, the special effects were cheesy.  You might as well sit at home and watch 2 hours worth of Charmed.  The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack.  Tomandandy were the same masterminds behind the awesome music in the remake of The Hills Have Eyes.  The songs by Rob Zombie and other metal bands were good too.  This movie kind of makes me think of Darkness Falls.  Not sure why, it just does.  Maybe because they were supposed to be so good and just flopped around like a fish out of water until they died.  I just wanna end on this note, the best part of the movie was when the closing credits began to run.

B000001DQI|5.0|GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is Elton John's best studio album ever, consisting of 17 songs which seem to be connected by a common theme of living a fantasy life and then facing reality in the aftermath of a revelation that fantasy and keeping it all inside is really not the best way to live. The title song actually inspired me to continue my move back to older music instead of just listening to whatever happens to be trendy at the time, whereas \\"Grey Seal\\" mocks the educational system in a way that now inspires me to skip my old school's Thanksgiving Dinner in favor of looking good for my favorite actresses. Make this album, HONKY CHATEAU, TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION, MADMAN ACROSS THE WATER, CARIBOU, and ROCK OF THE WESTIES the first Elton John albums you buy.
B000H305U0|2.0|Justin is REALLY biting on this song. Some of the tracks even sound like there may be some copyright infringement.   <br /> <br />I'm giving Justin two stars because the songs sound good, but that's because the songs by icons like Prince and Michael Jackson sounded good - so if you copy the style of something that has already proven to be successful - of course your songs are going to be decent. Plus, SexyBack sounds like David Bowie's style during the \\"Fame\\" days. Therefore, because of the biting (i.e., lack of originality) Justin gets 5 stars MINUS 3 = 2 stars.   <br /> <br />Whoever said \\"Until The End of Time\\" sounds like Prince (Beautiful Ones).  They are truly speaking the truth.  That song also sounds a lot like Usher.  Deg Justin...you're almost finding your own style...but you are not quite there yet. \\"Losing Myself\\"...does Justin really want to help the drug problem? His message lacks authenticity. Plus,  didn't he just say in an article that he gets high. Not a very honest message Justin.  <br /> <br />
B00003BDXG|4.0|Yeah it's using a sledgehammer to drive home a point, but the point still needs to be made...our culture is driven by an obsession with violence and the inept morons who dish it out. Finding the root cause of the obsession seems a bit beyond the scope of this film, however. Here we follow a twisted love story with two anti-heroes lashing out at the world that is depicted as being crazier than they are. By the end of the story it's clear that the two ruthless killers Mickey and Mallory, are the only characters worthy of empathy (well besides the old Indian fella that Mickey unceremoniously offs, just through reflex). All along the way, Stone paints the nightmare with liberal use of cinematic distortion techniques, mostly to good effect. I thought the rattlesnake incident was some type of drug abuse allegory but I could be wrong. The most effective sequence was the perverted situation comedy outlining the female protaganist's motivation for murder. Using Rodney Dangerfield as a disgusting monster of an abusive father abetted by a canned laughtrack was at once shocking and hilarious. The Geraldo-like character was played too over the top...but was bearable. Tommy Lee Jones had a good turn as a prison warden, just as over the top. I have no idea what Quentin Tarantino had put forth here that Stone rewrote, so I'll withold judgement on whether it would have been any better. The soundtrack was pretty decent and Leonard Cohen's \\"The Future\\" playing over the closing credits was a nice touch. This coulda been better, but it's still pretty good. Certainly a cut above anything the director of record has done recently.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Many are complaining that this movie isn't congruent to the actual facts (this may be an understatement).  But I must defend the movie because of the artistic merit of the screenplay, the photography, the film score (good job \\"Explosions in the Sky\\"), the actors, and the actresses.<br /><br />For a momment, let's consider other Hollywood films \\"based on true stories\\":<br /><br />Remember the Titans<br />--Fargo<br />--Goodfellas<br />--Casino<br />--Black Hawk Down<br />--JFK<br />--Born on the Forth of July<br />--Starship Troopers (no, just kidding)<br /><br />and most recently, Invincible (with Mark Whalburg)<br /><br />and many many more...<br /><br />OBVIOUSLY, the foregoing list of movies have many factual errors.  FOR EXAMPLE, The police chief in Fargo was a man (and not a pregnant woman as depicted in the film).<br /><br />Hollywood creates these films and stamps \\"Based on a true story\\" on the movie in order to SELL and MARKET the film.  The producers and film makers KNOW that they operate outside of the facts; producers DO NOT ATTEMPT to fabricate a movie exactly as it occured in real life.  This is called \\"Artistic Liberty\\".<br /><br />Notice that before the movie began, the subtitle which appeared DID NOT say, \\"This film is an ACCURATE re-creation of the actual events...\\"  The movie is not meant to be a documentary- it is meant to entertain rather than inform.  If the producers wanted to make a documentary, then they failed.  But the producers of Friday Night Lights wanted to make an entertaining and hard-hitting football flick.<br /><br />Also, at the end of the credits, a disclaimer appears stating specifically that the charecters and incidents portrayed in the film are fictional and any similarities to actual persons or events are merely coincidental.  Therefore, we must realize that the movie is a work of FICTION!<br /><br />Friday Night Lights was a great film- highly recomended.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I can appreciate Paul McCartney's wanting to get this project right as it was bugging him for 30 plus years. And Paul was the main contributer to the \\"Let it Be' project because Lennon was strung out on heroin and Yoko and George was apathetic. The inclusion of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is a very good addition. This version of \\"Across the Universe\\" is better. And the deletion of some nonsense material is also a good move. However, the \\"Long and Winding Road\\" sounds better on the original recording and the \\"Let It Be\\" guitar solo and riffs by Harrison sound much crisper and heavier on the original. This version (which was actually recorded earlier) has a rather weak sounding guitar sound that detracts mightily from this otherwise excellent rock song. No wonder Lennon made fun of this soft version of the song \\"Let It Be\\". If the best song on the album was made worse than this project cannot really be called an improvement.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end; so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound.  This is due to its subject, its star, and its director, Julie Taymor, who also gave us the astounding Titus.  (If you have not yet seen Titus, do so before finishing this review - it is an art director's tour de force on a par with Brazil.)<br /><br />Regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum, one can't help but be intrigued by the fascinating, and certainly unconventional, people of Frida.  Diego Rivera, played superbly by Alfred Molina, boasted the traditional faults of great artists, (narcissism, thoughtless cruelty, obsessive egotism), while showcasing some exceptional ones, (art as propaganda device, naive political idealism).  His flaws were as large as his murals, but he was never dull.<br /><br />In addition to starring as Frida, Salma Hayek co-produced the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made.  How wonderful that she did.  Hayek has traveled under a Hollywood curse, appearing in one dreadful picture after another.  This is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by, and her performance is note perfect.  The story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy, but Hayek never lets that happen.  Her Frida is heart and steel all at once - amazing.<br /><br />The take home message, if there is one, is that great art is never free.  In the case of Rivera, others paid the price; he fed off others like a greedy child.  In the case of Frida Kahlo, she herself paid the price, digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave.  There are moments of magic realism in Frida, where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa - if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were, astounding autobiographical statements.<br /><br />There are a few missteps.  The liaisons with Trotsky and Josephine Baker feel almost obligatory, as if a form is being filled out.  But blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments, for example, when Rivera's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in Mexico.<br /><br />Beyond highly recommended - must viewing.eing filled out.

B000023VR6|5.0|It's hard to say which album is better, this or The Chronic. Well I think their both amazing. Dre is without a doubt one of if not the best producer ever. There are plenty of great songs on this, and it features guests such as. His old homie Snoop, his new protege Eminem, Xzibit and Nate Dogg. All of which are great. Dre is certainly not the best rapper of all time so he has guest appearances on just about every song. <br />My top five tracks are <br />1. The Watcher <br />2. Still D.R.E. <br />3. Forgot About Dre <br />4. The Next Episode <br />5. Murder Ink
0618001905|5.0|A standing ovation for this book. Wonderfully written, without judgment or moralizing about this horrifying time. Just the well researched facts. The judgment- and lessons to be learned- is left to the reader <br />His next book is already on my wish list.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Rise Against is my favorite band. After hearing Siren song of the Counter Culture (their third album) i was dissapointed. I was hoping that they would come up better with the sufferer and the witness and they did. Songs like Bricks, and Chamber cartridge are really great. So if you like punk music, by this record!!!!!
B00005KAQP|5.0|I saw this movie the other day and want to buy it soo bad! Whoopi Goldberg does an excellent job. It is soo funny, I rolled around laughing. Everyone should see it, it's enjoyable for the whole family!!
B000C1YL1G|5.0|As people should know, a greatest hits collection is supposed to be all the songs that became singles, and not just peoples favourites. They have managed to include all the hits from Em's solo albums which is great. Then the bonus mixtape had some great songs that I hadn't heard before. It's such a pity that Em is retiring because his done such a lot of good for hip hop. In fact Em is not only by far the best white rapper ever, but he is one of the best if not the best rapper out there today. This CD shows you what he was all about. There are those comedic songs like Just Lose It and The Real Slim Shady which are great but nothing beats Em's emotional tracks. Such as Mockingbird, Like Toy Soldiers, Lose Yourself and When I'm Gone.  <br /> <br />If you have just got into Eminem than his greatest hits would be a great place to start. Of course these are not his only good songs, his solo albums are full of goodness.
0446577383|1.0|I had to stop reading this book at page 118, as there are just too many ridiculous, unrealistic, and unecessary conversations between far too many ill-conceived and unlikely characters. I bought this at random at an airport out of sheer boredom, but I would rather do just about anything else rather than read this book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One of the best science fiction movies ever made. Even if you didn't see the TV series the movie holds together very well, the characters are memorable, and the story line is intriguing. You do not need to have watched Firefly to enjoy this. <br /> <br />A couple of recent reviews were so mired in dishonesty and stupidity that some comment is indicated.  <br /> <br />No, this movie owes no debt to Star Wars. Star Wars is a series for children, preteens and young teens. Serenity is for adults. Anyone who thinks this movie has any meaningful comparison to Star Wars has lost contact with reality. When you graduate from high school, try watching Serenity again, because you clearly do not get it. And by the way, when Star Wars makes you cringe and turn it off, you will know you are an adult. <br /> <br />And yes this is science fiction. It takes place in the future, on undiscovered worlds and it takes place in space, any of which qualify it as science fiction. This however is intelligent science fiction with great character development so those who have been mired in the putrid swamp where a great deal of science fiction rests, may not recognize good science fiction. <br /> <br />And no, this is not a bad Star Trek episode. Star Trek was ground breaking in its day, but only the very best Trek episodes could be honestly mentioned in the same breath with the Firefly episodes, and nothing in the Trek series approaches this movie. <br /> <br />People who are trying to compare this to Star Wars or Star Trek don't get it at all. That's like trying to compare watermelons and oranges.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|The movie is about two men who fake fairytales for money. They are employed to stop these children from disapearing into a forest in a town. Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm take on the job or be forced to die and go into the forest. This is a really good movie and is an action packed fairytale!
B0009WFF7M|2.0|I've purchased the original PCM encoded CD more than once because I enjoy this album so much.  I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc.  Why would you disable that option?  I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD.  The recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|This one is the ultimate \\"You've gotta be kidding me!\\"  They finally offer the theatrical versions on DVD and they're LETTERBOXED?!?!  I mean, after all, the digitally enhanced version is \\"nice\\", but when the Death Star explodes in the climactic scene, the new version just looks wrong.  All of a sudden I'm worried about the digitally enhanced version of the original Star Trek that premieres in my area tomorrow... <br /> <br />Thanks, George, for yanking my chain on this one.  Should I ever have the opportunity to meet you, I'll be certain to ask for my refund in person.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Sunset Boulevard is directed by legendary director Billy Wilder, who also directed Some Like it Hot and The Apartment; The film is featured in Roger Ebert's \\"The Great Movies\\" and is #12 on The American Film Institute's Top 100. It's an important film, that skates dangerously close to the real lives of the actors portraying some of the characters, but it's also one of the most well-acted and entertaining films on that list. The movie stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter living in Los Angeles. In one of the best opening shots in film history, Joe narrates as we follow a number of policemen who head to a mansion where a man floats in the pool dead; We learn the man has suffered some gunshot wounds. We don't clearly see the man's face, but we have an idea who it is. The film flashes back and we meet Joe as two repo men come to take his car. He's parked his car across the street, so he gets into it and heads to Paramount. His script has been turned down and his luck gets worse when the repo men spot him as he leaves. After his tire blows out, Joe pulls into the garage of what appears to be a deserted mansion on Sunset Boulevard. What he discovers is that the mansion is not deserted at all. Occupying it is an aging silent film star named Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is the stereotypical once famous actress. Her grotesque and semi-dilapitated mansion features a shrine of herself and she frequently sits down to watch old movies, starring herself. Joe realizes that Norma is a little bit off, but is sucked into her world. Norma is writing a script and she wants Joe's help; In return, she gives Joe money and a place to live. While the story between Joe and Norma is a love story, the love story part of the movie belongs to Joe and Betty (Nancy Olson), a Paramount writer. Joe begins sneaking out of Norma's house at night to co-write a script with Betty, who eventually falls for him. AsI said earlier, the film cuts close to the actor's real lives. Most notably in the case of Swanson and von Stroheim. Swanson was, like Desmond, a silent-film star hoping for a comeback. With this film, she not only achieved that but gave one of the best performances in film history. von Stroheim was, as his character is in the film, a former silent-film director who showed a lot of promise. The film even uses real people playing dramatized versions of themselves, such as Cecile B. Demille. Most people, if they've heard of the film, have heard of it because of it's famous quotes. Wilder's films have dialogue that leaves a mark on you and this film is only a notch below Some Like it Hot on the best curtain lines. <br />Swanson goes completely over-the-top in her performance, you could define it as campy almost...It works though and it suits her well in the end. The film isn't really meant to be a character study, but more of a look at the darker underbelly of Hollywood. The final line, in itself, is not creepy...The way Swanson delivers it, the look in her eye, is. The film has great cinematography, a great cast and amazing performances, a solid script, and great dialogue. Dare I say it? It may just be a perfect film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B00009YOQW|5.0|I use this drum with developmentally delayed children between the ages of 2-5. They love it and it's durable. Great purchase.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|I have to only give this album 3 stars because although the musicality of it is great, the riffs, bass, three guitar \\"blast\\" and everything else you expect from maiden is all great but the entire album is so mellow and you just cant get into it like you can the old maiden.  For the hardcore fan/collector, go ahead and buy it, but for the casual listener, Id stick with the first 7 albums.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Ok, if you don't own any DVD copy of Star Wars than these DVDs are worth something I guess. The problem is, that many people (including myself) will buy them for the original theatrical release versions on the bonus DVD. And the quality is abysmal.<br /><br />These original theatrical transfers look as if they were re-recorded from filming a projector. No only that they are LETTERBOX versions. What! That is just plain addle brained in this day of HDTV and wide screen TVs. I don't expect detail where is did not exist but I do expect to be able to play the thing in the correct aspect ration and not have more than 1/3 of the DVD be wasted on coding black bars. Not only that, my DVD player can not even zoom in the correct aspect ration to eliminate the LETTERBOX. Even if have a setup that does this correctly, you will be zooming in on an already craptastic transfer.<br /><br />For example, there is quite a bit of color-shifting throughout most of the movie which can be seen clearly through the flesh tones. It almost looks like they forgot to remove the macrovision copy protection and you have an illegal copy. The results are a muddy mess and there is no way that this is all they could do with the original release.<br /><br />For those that are saying you got what \\"you asked for\\" read some of the earlier posts. There are tons of digital re-mastered version of old movies that look ten times better. What \\"we asked for\\" is the original movie content. We are not against digital repair of poor color, grain, jitter, etc.<br /><br />Bottom line is, this is a horrendous transfer of the original movies. If you are buying it for these original versions you will probably be somewhat disappointed especially if you have a wide screen TV of any sort.<br /><br />I am just sick of these crappy re-releases of the only good Star Wars films. I guess now they will re-re-re-release an better (but probably still messed up) version on HD-DVD in 2 years. Sadly, you should wait until then before you buy.then before you buy.
B000H305U0|4.0|i luv this album!!!!!!!! my fav. songs are lovestoned, until the end of time and much more!! BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW!!
B000H305U0|1.0|I think Justin spent way to much time trying to sound like Prince and Micheal Jackson and not enough time sounding like Justin. This CD is a poor crappy effert.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is a great television show.  It's got a real X-Files vibe.  It's filmed in Canada, too--cloudy skies, rain, damp, wild landscapes.  The costumes, locations, and sets are heavy on black, gray, navy, hunter green--it's got a wonderful dark and creepy feel.  The two leads are just gorgeous to look at--and they are also fine actors with deep expressive voices.  Their emotional relationship is the heart of the show.  I'm not a huge horror fan--I close my eyes during some of the special effects that draw in the most fans, I suppose.  It's only \\"monster of the week\\" on a superficial level--and it has plenty of that.  But there's an emotional journey--the relationship between the brothers evolves, the relationship between them and their father is revealed slowly, and Sam starts to develop some interesting abilties that will be important later and freak his brother out a bit.  The relationship between the boys has a Mulder-Scully feel of deep caring.  There's plenty of sibling rivalry and brotherly pranks and humor, too.  This show is a lot of fun--it's deep and dark, but funny and touching.  It's perfect for late at night in a dark and quiet house.  A few of the episodes are weaker than the others--but the number of really quality episodes is quite high.<br /><br />The show is both scary and emotionally satisfying.  Padalecki and Ackles have superb chemistry--that's a large part of the show's success.<br /><br />The dvds are excellent--they look great when I zoom in on the letterbox to fit my 16:9 screen.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I purchased this CD on a whim after hearing Crazy and seeing the video and I am so glad I did. It is an excellent CD and one the best CD's I purchased this yr. Good Going Guy!!!
B000G75AE8|4.0|It took Slayer 5 long years to follow up God Hates Us All, which was a spectacular collection of great songs and bad songs in my opinion. Bloodline, God send death, Here comes the pain, and the title track, along with a couple of others, were outstanding 11's on a scale of 10. But the remaining songs were 2's and 3's.  With Christ Illusion we have an almost unblemished collection of solid 7's. The tracks are all good, but none of them great.  All enjoyable to hear, but almost forgettable before they end.  I I think the production is great and definetly see this album, and their previous to be a return to the formula that made them so great to begin with.  Hopefully there will be much more to come.  I would undoubtedly recommend this album to any Slayer fan. I must mention the one song that received a score of 1 which was Jihad.  Aside from the pretty bad musical content, it was a let down to hear Araya sing in the words of the enemy.  I know they have to try to be contraversial,  but did they have to sink so low to do so?
B0000027DJ|5.0|Hey Stoopid never lets up. You won't hear any grungy or sludgy electric guitar static here. The clear and robust six-string sound helps deliver an '80's metal sound--AT ITS VERY FINEST!   \\"Snakebite\\" has a deliciously eery melodic feel which might remind you of sounds from Another Perfect Day (Motorhead--also a highly recommended album). \\"Dangerous Tonight\\" starts out sinister and then goes on to \\"cause you pain and make it last\\"! And you will NEVER forget that strutting bass line of \\"Frankenstein\\" that moves your body as it teases you up to the explosion that launches the chorus.  I just chose three songs to give some feel for the real variety and creativity you will experience with this intense CD.  Buckle your seatbelt when you spin this one--definitely not background music!  Ozzy's cameo appearance, ironically, seems to just underscore Coop's talent in creating moods with his lyrics and vocals. Anyway, if it's things dark and heavy, especially where the heavy makes the dark, darker, and the dark makes the heavy even heavier, then feed your Frankenstein right here.   \\"It's...LUNCH TIME!\\"
B00013RC9I|5.0|I can't help it, I LOVE Air.  I know there is a giant movement out there and the majority of Air lovers prefer Moon Safari, but I disagree.  I think Talkie Walkie is far more refined.  It's smoother, and it hits your touchy feely places.  It's also more consistent throughout than Moon Safari and has much better flow.  I  think I can get around the cheesy lyrics by brushing it off as Frenchies with a language barrier thing.  The music speaks for itself and I've never played a song more times than Universal Traveler.  This album is a MUST have for anyone.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|If you need a reason to finally pull the trigger and blow your brains out, the this movie is well worth the money.  It's 90 minutes agonizing tedium followed by 3 minutes of Chloë Sevigny giving soft-porn oral.  I guess I could give her bonus points for having sex with a guy for a change.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|George Lucas HAS the restored digitally remastered DIGITAL MASTERS that were used for the 1994 VHS releases. He chose not to use these for the \\"bonus discs\\" with these releases but instead used the INFERIOR laser disc masters. Why? Because if it was really good quality, less people would feel a need to buy it again, ergo he makes less money... simple it is!
B000H305U0|5.0|Maybe its just me, but I think often many people over analyze when it comes to music.  But again, maybe its just me.  I personally love the cd.  I was a bit skeptical because the first listen of sexback kind of took me back for a minute.  I wasn't sure what to quite make of the sound, but that was the initial listen.  As I really was able to digest the sound, I loved it and then realized Timbaland produced it, which made me like it more.  At any rate, all the comparisons to Michael Jackson and now ever since I read an article on AOL about Until the end of time sounding like an updated prince, now everyone wants to think he's biting his style.  I never got that impression.  Michael Jackson maybe, prince nahhh.  At any rate who hasn't been influenced by MJ.  I don't sing, but if a MJ song comes on I can go in a trance.  That is what the sound of that era did.  It was groundbreaking.  Everyone up until this time has tried to reinvent so to speak and there are some noteworthy efforts.  I think Justin makes good music solo.  I couldn't stand him in the group.  I think his vocals are much better, using what works for him instead of singing through the nose like he did with the group.  At any rate, I think the music is great, I think Timbaland has found a wave to ride again and I'm happy with listening to it.
0689825498|5.0|My 17 month old loves this book. There is something for him to open on each page and he has learned all the sounds of the animals.  This book was recently listed in Parent's magazine as \\"Our Favorite Baby Books of All Time\\"  and I can see why.
B00003CX95|5.0|'Braveheart', the Academy Award winning film from '95 tells the story of William Wallace, the Scottish poet/warrior and patriot that inspired Scotland in their fight for independence from England in the early 14th century. Mel Gibson is magnificent as William Wallace in this cinematic gem that will linger in your memory long after the ending.<br /><br />Filmmaking just doesn't get any better than this, 'Braveheart' is storytelling at its zenith. Cinematography, epic landscapes, bloody battles and a tender love story and an unforgetable soundtrack combine into one grand tapestry providing the ultimate viewing experience that touches upon almost every human emotion.<br /><br />This is a film you can watch over and over again and still enjoy as though it were your first viewing. My Highest Recommendation!
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Alright its got a great collection but I have to say there could be alot more from their glory years not all their stuff from the 80's. My Favorite Song has to be \\"Carry On My Wayward Son\\" and \\"Point Of Know Return\\". This isn't the best collection that they could've made. But it does have some great songs on it. But really you'll want to get the individual albums by themselves because then you'll have all the great and classic songs that you'll ever want. But still if your just after their most famous hits buy this album. Heck I did and believe it or not I quite enjoyed. It really is a great album to listen to and own. If you don't feel like spending your money on all of the individual albums buy this one.
0385338694|3.0|This book was nice and light - perfect holiday read!. It is however (as most books are in the genre) VERY predictable but the story is fun.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I just saw this movie last night, having NEVER played a Final Fantasy game in my life. <br /> <br />Now mind you, we were late getting dinner and I was starving--but I almost forgot to eat, this thing was so captivating.  Between trying to figure out what the heck was going on, alternately asking my friends questions and then telling them to hush so they wouldn't spoil it for me, and simply WATCHING the amazing animation, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen as my dinner sat cooling, unheeded, on my lap. <br /> <br />I'll admit, some of the action scenes are a bit too frenetic, or suffer from a complete lack of respect for physics.  And there are a couple odd bits--mostly involving the spiritual connection between the former SOLDIERs, I think--that are just nigh incomprehensible.  And yeah, the movie's going to have more emotional impact for someone who's played through FF7 and already knows the characters. <br /> <br />Thing is, though, even though I wasn't familiar with the game or anyone in it, the movie in general totally hooked me, and the bits leading up to the ending just floored me.  I can't stress enough how incredible the animation is.  It's my opinion that the subject matter was better served by the videogame-like CGI than it would have been by either anime or live action.  From the character renderings to the incredibly detailed backgrounds, the movie was just BEAUTIFUL.  And wow, Sephiroth.  I understand all the fuss over him a bit better, now! <br /> <br />Today, I went to Wikipedia and looked up the series and did some reading, and am considering getting hold of the game (my only reason for not doing so at this point being that I don't actually own a Playstation!). <br /> <br />Not a bad accomplishment for a movie made from a game I've never seen, eh?
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Not one single filler on this album.  John Mayer does another amazing job. Standout tracks: \\"Dreaming With a Broken Heart,\\" \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,\\" and \\"I Don't Trust Myself (with Loving You)\\"
B000GFLAI0|2.0|5 stars!!! Please people. Aside from exactly two songs, this melodious tripe is almost unbearable to listen to. Someone else said it right - the lyrics may be interesting, if you could make them out. If he'd published this as a book of poems, we would have gotten more out of it. Then at least you could read what he's saying rather than having to listen to a voice that sounds like fingernail squeal on a chalkboard. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of what he's done, especially recently, but this - no way. He said in an interview that the band was the BEST he's ever worked with. They are good, no doubt but the lame repetitive chords they're forced to play verse after verse, song after song, must've been mind numbing for these guys. I play a little guitar and the riff's that spin on these songs would present absolutely no challenge for me or virtually anyone else that's memorized the basic four chords. In all likelihood, I'll burn this to my hard drive and take \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" and probably one other, maybe, and include them on my own \\"best of bob\\" CD. As a potential buyer, I would suggest you listen to the tracks Amazon offers to you on their site, that's all you'll need to hear from this CD.
B000H5V8DG|4.0|ALIAS began with a bang and took the audience on a shock-per-minute ride that barelled along through the first three seasons. Flawless acting (by Ms. Garner, Mr. Garber, Mr. Rifkin, Mr. Vartan and Ms. Olin specifically), outrageous plot twists, breathtaking suspense and action blended seamlessly into an hour of appointment television. But due to the erratic programming schedule of the third season (new episodes would sometimes come in three to four weeks after), the ratings took a dip. <br /> <br />This unfortunately heralded a reactionary tinkering by producers, writers and network executives that only served to make a mess that only got worse as season four unfolded. First, in a bid to undo the damage of the previous season they managed to schedule airing to run uninterrupted through the fourth season - only to deafeat the purpose entirely by producing stand alone episodes that really required no continuity. Without the cliffhanger endings, the suspense came to abrupt halt. Whereas in the previous three seasons, even the mere thought of Sydney getting caught rifling through someone's desk was enough to render a minor heart attack since absolutely anything could happen - in Season 4 each episode played like a by the numbers action show where we could all count on everyone hanging around at the end of the show sharing a cup of coffee for another day's job well done. And perhaps even more damaging was moving the show's central focus away from Sydney altogether. Watch season 4 again and look for even the shadow of a story arc that actually moves Sydney's life forward. She became a periphery on her own show with countless episodes devoted to Vaughn's and Nadia's respective journeys. In small doses this move may have worked but not when it meant devoting large blocks of storylines dealing with the characters around Syndey and leaving her little to do other than reacting to them. Another misstep was the lack of any really menacing villains. A cowardly playboy, a small time drug pusher, really? No, seriously, I want to know - really? Where were the rocket launcher toting maniacal glee of Sark and Lauren and Sloane and Irina? Let's not even dignify the eye-rolling absurdity of the vampire episode, the blatant La Femme Nikita ripoff and the zombie plot line of the finale. The only thing that kept the finale from collapsing under the weight of its misguided hubris was the scalpel sharp precision acting of Lena Olin. <br /> <br />Which brings us to season 5. (Spoiler alert) At first, Alias seemed to live up to the promise of a return to its suspenseful earlier seasons. Unfortunately, when you decide to kill off a major character like Vaughn, you had better stick to your convictions otherwise you're just blowing smoke up our collective behinds. It was just a bad idea altogether because Vaughn is indispensible to Sydney's life. However, I would like to present 24 Season Five where major characters kept dropping like flies to maximum shocking effect. And no, however much we may have wished, no one came back from the dead. And might I add - continuity that did not second guess the viewers intelligence or ability to keep up. Now that's conviction and confidence in how good a story you're telling. But at last, the story did (briefly) return to Sydney only to get derailed again when stories began to focus on Rachel and the could-you-be-any-more-boring Balthazar Ghetty. With the diminished number of episodes, it was even more galling to have to waste time on Agent Grace's insipid backstory. The best thing he ever did was the sacrifice at the end of the show. And by then all the deaths seemed, well, gutless - it's the last ep right, so who cares who you kill. Don't get me wrong though, there were high points - Irina's complexity (thank heavens no one decided to \\"reform\\" her) and the return of the always entertaining Mr. Sark (though sadly without partner in crime Lauren Reed). Unfortunately, there truly was a sense of rushing things along that prevented stories from fully developing (the Anna Espinosa duplicate Sydney was over before it even began). Overall not nearly as absymal as season 4 with a series finale that truly pays off. But when one sees how amazing a show 24 can be on its fifth season, you wonder what the hell happened to Alias.
1400032717|5.0|I've never read anything quite like this.  The author has to juggle many things.  First of all, he created a great mystery story line.  Also he had to tell it from the perspective of an autistic boy.  On top of that there's all kinds of probing insights into human nature that the author can make throught the eyes of an autistic.  He does all three things flawlessly.  This is a really great voice and character that Haddon has given to Christopher.  It's also quite a humorous book in some instances.  Not laugh-out-loud, but definitely amusing.      <br /> <br />I read this book in 2 days!  It is THAT good!!
0061150142|1.0|\\"The Pact\\" is the first Jodi Picioult book I read...and it turned out to be the last. I admit I've been baffled to see this one come out in reprint and to see so many of her other books appearing and selling so well, because while she can write, I just didn't find the plot of this book realistic, and it so turned me off her that I haven't been able to bring myself to try her again. <br /> <br />The reasons? Two, mainly. First, that the parents in this book are depicted as being overjoyed that their son and daughter have become \\"soul mates\\" at such a young age and seem headed unwaveringly toward marriage. Why is this unrealistic to me? For this simple reason: one of the families is Jewish, and the other is not. I think it's a pretty well-known fact that in many Jewish families, the idea that one of the children would even fall in love with, much less marry, a non-Jew is absolute anathema. Some families would even consider such a child \\"dead\\" to them. Yet this Jewish family has no problem whatsoever with the situation. I would not mind if the potential for such conflict had at least been addressed, and it was established that this particular family did not feel that way about this subject or about this relationship, that they were close enough to the other family that it did not matter. But to simply tell us that one family is Jewish and the other isn't, and then to expect us to accept that the romance between their children is fully accepted and celebrated by both--well, that was too much for me to swallow. <br /> <br />My second problem, and this is by far worse, is the ending. I will not give it away here even though I hated the book, but let's just say I could see it coming down Broadway with both doors open, so not only was it not the least bit of a surprise, it was also, to my mind, not at all earned. I have no problem with a book's ending so long as I feel it is \\"earned.\\" I did not feel this ending was earned at all. It was simply not such that you could go back through the book afterward and realize the author was dropping subtle hints throughout that made the ending of the book make sense and that made you say \\"OK now, I can understand why it happened this way and it all has integrity.\\" No, the ending was entirely \\"deus ex machina\\" and I got the feeling the author ended the book as she did not because that was the way things would have turned out in real life had this story actually happened, but simply because that was how she \\"wanted\\" things to end for her characters. She was too \\"in love\\" with them to let matters take the course she had set up for them in her own plot. So she had to stage a \\"rescue\\" at the end, so to speak. And that's as far as I'll go to describe that. <br /> <br />In conclusion: this is the reason I haven't been able to pick up another Jodi Picoult book. I get the feeling that she's underestimated the intelligence of her readers (most of whom, I admit, appear to be thrilled with her output) and that she might pull something like this again. I don't like feeling betrayed by authors who are inept at pulling off an unexpected plot twist, because I get the feeling they did it just because they thought they could get away with it, and some readers let them. Not me.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best of the various productions of Pride/Prejudice.  It is truly faithful to the book and the performances are outstanding.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|Although I prefer the albums that preceeded it, and Counterpart, which came later, this is still a welcomed addition to Rush's catalog.  Rush is a band that changed its sound throughout the years NOT because they \\"sold-out\\", but rather because they have a keen ear for different sounds and are open to experimentation.  This is why, all of their albums (much like the band logos that adorn them) have a uniqueness to them.  If they have continued puttiong out records that sounded like the first one, they would not have the following they have today.  Presto doesn't sound like 2112, or like Moving Pictures... there is no question about that.  But, the album still contains many memorable moments, of which \\"Show Don't tell\\" and \\"The Pass\\" are just a handful.  The reviewer that goes by \\"Kid\\" and posted on August 6th claims that Rush at this point sounded like those \\"crappy alternative Acts from the early/mid 90's\\" and that they were just \\"trend-followers\\".  Gee...that's odd...considering this album was released in 1989!!!! I'm not sure how hip this \\"Kid\\" is, but although Nirvana had a record out in 1989, not many people had heard of them.  The alternative explosion would not arrive until a few years later, making this claim baseless.
0060516402|1.0|Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the \\"great\\" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|I have not really listened to a lot of metal bands in probably the last 10 years because I thought a lot of them became very cliche and there are definitely some out there that are cliche's but not Mastodon. I first heard of Mastodon or I shouls say saw Mastodon when I was watching Headbangers Ball and saw the video for Blood And Thunder. I saw this amazing band playing this unbelievably heavy song and surprisingly they have a sense of humor( who doesn't love metal and clowns). I have unfortunately never given the album Leviathan the true listen that it needs to be but after listening to Blood Mountain that is going to change. Blood Mountain is simply the best metal album I have heard probably since Metallica's And Justice For All was released. There is no denying the musicianship of all the band members. Standouts for me on this album are: <br />1. Sleeping Giant- Probably the best metal song I have heard in years. <br />2. Circle of Sysquatch <br />3. Colony Of Birchmen <br />4. This Mortal Soil <br />5. Siberian Divide <br />6. Bladecatcher <br />This is going to be a classic years from now. So get this album and enjoy the mighty Mastodon.  <br />
B000H305U0|5.0|I had no intention of buying this cd then I heard sexy back and thought I like that but not enough to buy it. Then I heard my love with TI and decided to buy it. I am so glad that I did I have not been able to stop listening to this cd.  I really like this cd I do not like all the songs but unlike some cd's I like more than two songs on the whole disc. There are a lot of songs that I love on this disc but my favorite is until the end of time. I am a huge Prince fan until the end of time sounds like it's missing from the purple rain soundtrack. I think Prince would be proud and just a little jealous of that track.  <br />I have to give Timberland his props he brought the best out of Mr. Timberlake.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I have been a fan for John Mayer for several years now. I first heard of John on a radio program called Reg's Coffehouse on WRAX in Birmingham, AL they played John's music long before Room For Squares came out and I believe in the liner notes of Room For Squares there is a mention of the station manager/ programmer who gave him so much attention. Although, a fan of John I have never thought he had done a great album from start to finish. Continuum, though, has definitely made me a believer in John again he has definitely stepped up and made a great album. This album shows one thing and that is that he has matured and grown a lot musically in the past couple of years. There is not a weak song on here from start to finish. Standouts on the album really is all of the songs on the album. I have only one problem with the album and that is the cover of Jimi Hendrix's Bold As Love. John does a great job with the song and I do enjoy the song but the problem is the song to me sticks out like a sore thumb because all of the songs on the album fit really well together until you get to this song and it disrupts the mood of the album. The album would have been much better to have left that song of the album and put it out as a B-side or as a single by itself but not on the album. Okay that out of the way I do have some personal favorites off of the album and they are: <br />1. Slow Dancing In A Burning Room <br />2. Dreaming With A Broken Heart <br />3. In Repair <br />4. Stop This Train <br />5. The Heart Of Life <br />But as I said this album does not have a bad song on it including the song Bold As Love. If your a fan of John buy this album steal it if you must because this is John's finest hour in his career so far. If you want to hear a really soulful and melodic album this is a must buy for those as well. Waiting On The World To Change sounds like it could have been written in the '60's.
1563890119|5.0|Any comic fan, avid or casual, knows the list of essential comic reading that proves that comics aren't just for kids.  Of course there's Watchmen, Dark Knight Returns, Maus, Preacher, and more, and of course also on that list is Neil Gaiman's celebrated Sandman series.  Preludes and Nocturnes is the beginning of one of the most revered adult series in comics history, as Gaiman weaves a tale in which Dream of the Endless seeks to reclaim the realm he lost when he was imprisoned some seventy years before.  He sets forth on a mission to regain the tools of his that were lost and seek revenge on those responsible, and on the way he comes across many of DC/Vertigo's icons, including John Constantine and the Martian Manhunter, and travels to the depths of Hell to face down Lucifer Morningstar himself.  Frequently chilling and startlingly poignant, this first volume in the Sandman saga is essential reading, and believe it or not, it only gets better with each passing volume.
6304779356|4.0|The perfect '80's vampire film.  A great cast who all seem to really understand and love the script, fun effects, cool soundtrack, blood, gore, and laughs all add up to one of the better vampire films that moved the genre out of the Transilvania age.  Jason Patric was on the verge of his total coolnees, the Coreys were still cute and funny, Edward Herrmann playing against his serious mini-series type, Dianne Weist the doting daffy mom and Barnard Hughes as the Jimmy Buffet of grandfathers all add up to a really fun ride.<br /><br />It's a comic, action-adventure, thriller, vampire flick that makes the cynics proud of how the genre could be modernized and still allow the cynics to laugh - freely.<br /><br />Visually stunning, fun, cool and worthy of its cult status.
B00005R1N3|5.0|Black Christmas is one of those underrated horror gems that you've either heard little to nothing about, but is responsible for spawning a host of better known immitators and knock-offs.  Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder star as sorority sisters in a house that is emptying out for Christmas, and soon enough they start getting menacing phone calls, and they soon realize that someone else is in the house with them.  It's a plot you've no doubt heard before, but Black Christmas did it earlier and better than all after it, and the performances by Hussey and bad girl Kidder are utterly believable.  Look for strong turns from 2001: A Space Odyssey's Keir Dullea, and B-movie god John Saxon as well.  Soon enough, the film should gain much more notoriety than it has ever garnered, considering it's being remade by former X-Files staff member Glen Morgan.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|This new version of the famous Willy Wonka story is fun and interesting despite its flaws. Fans of Tim Burton will recognize his distinct, gothic style and fantastical soundtrack from the very beginning of the film. His love of special effects is here as well, but unlike some modern day movies (ex. the very sad new Star Wars trilogy), Burton's effects never take center stage to the story. The movie's real strength is in the first forty minutes or so when we meet Charlie Bucket and his poor, but gentle and loving family. It is here that the heart of the movie truly lies and the part which is most accomidating to younger audience members, thus earning the movie's title as \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" rather than the previously named 1971 film \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\"  <br /> <br />Once the movie moves toward Willy Wonka and the tour through his enormous factory, the dark undertone that the story has held since its conception is taken up a notch. If the 1971 movie did not creep you out as a child (as it did me) then this one is a sure-fire gaurentee. For one, Johnny Deep's Willy Wonka bare's such and obvious resemblance to Michael Jackson that it is truly difficult to believe Johnny Depp's denial of Jackson's inspiration for the character. From his pale skin and clothing fetishes to his reclusive lifestyle in an enormous playland to childhood issues with an estranged father, Wonka so resembles Jackson that one feels genuinely uneasy and concerned for Charlie Bucket when the two of them form a close (and unsupervised) relationship at the end of the movie. In spite of this, however, fans of Depp who appreciate his accentric and imaginative movie career will be able to appreciate and even laugh along with his bizaare portrayel.  <br /> <br />The most interesting and surreal aspect of the movie of course is the creation of the Oompa Lumpas, played by Deep Roy multiplied by a hundred in a special effects miracle. The extravegent song and dance numbers of the small and somewhat creepy Oompa Lumpas, combined with Depp's bizaare and over the top peformance, earn this movie the adjective \\"trippy,\\" all the more enhanced by the goofy, yet frightening fates of the \\"naughty children\\" (these include getting stuck in a chocolate pipe, turning into a giant blueberry, getting thrown into an incinerator by murderous squirrels, and being shrunk to the size of a candy bar in a freak television transmission accident). Therefore if you are not a child, but still enjoy dooby-enhanced mind trip or generally odd, Alice-in-Wonderland-esque stories, then you will find interest in this movie. The movie of course, is suitable for children, but can also entertain (with both light and dark humor) adults. Still, if you have an especially squeemish or sensative child, you might want to leave him or her at home and check it out yourself.
6301763041|4.0|Sort of like Grease/Outsiders gone crazy.  Good movie and performances.  I had no idea Johnny Depp could sing.  I enjoyed the \\"jail house rock\\" spoof, and the music is great. Not a GREAT movie though, couldn't touch Grease or American Graffiti. But it IS worth watching.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|My first Maiden album (yes, an LP) was Powerslave -- and I saw them on the World Slavery Tour soon thereafter. If it helps at all, Piece of Mind, I believe, is their best overall album, with Powerslave and Killers jointly holding a close second. Every post-7th Son has been hit and miss, with the two Blaze albums decidedly misses. <br /> <br />Anyway, maybe that sets some context for you if you're a fan. As for this new album, it's amazing. There are songs that rival some of the best from the first seven albums -- The Longest Day, Out of the Shadows (feels cut from the Revelations mold, but completely its own entity), and Ben Breeg. In fact, everything but Lord of Light qualifies as classic Maiden, and yet none of it sounds re-hashed or redundant. Lord of Light is good, but I'd put it on the level of The Duellists, in that relative to the rest of the album it qualifies as filler. <br /> <br />I'm not going to go on at length -- many other reviews do a fine job of going through each song, and I needn't repeat what they've already said. I will say this, though: the songs are all richly-told stories, and I've found myself thinking a lot about just the words -- they're inspiring. As musicians they haven't sounded this good -- harder, more melodic, and tighter as a band -- since the 80s. I don't know how a band puts out album 14 and it sounds like they're still in their peak. And frankly I can't believe that after almost 3 decades Bruce can still out-sing anyone out there, period, no contest...find some modern metal 'razor blades in the throat' excuse for a vocalist and hold him against Bruce -- there's no comparison. <br /> <br />A lot of bands find their element and stay there, and end up putting out the same album year after year -- the Stones are a perfect example of stale music. I guess Maiden just never got the memo about how it's acceptable for legends to get a little rusty so long as they can still play the classics. A Matter of Life and Death is a classic -- howmany more years of great music will these guys offer up? If this album is any indication, the Irons are just hitting their second wind.
0375831002|5.0|Enough said. This book is not just a young adult book. It is wonderful for adults. Give it a try!!!
B000GFLAI0|2.0|I like and respect Bob Dylan's writing.  But after 40+ years, his voice is terribly ragged.  He sounds like a cross between a sick frog and an old man with emphysema.  That wouldn't be so bad if the album came with printed lyrics.  Then I could enjoy the lyrical poetry.  However, because of his awful vocals, most of the words are unintelligible. Can he get another singer to cover the vocals? <br /> <br />I compared his voice with Blood on the Tracks, which actually has some nice qualities.  Although I've never been a fan of the overly nasal quality he seems to gravitate towards.  <br /> <br />The band is good, the intruments are clear and well played.  But after all, the voice is an instrument as well.  It sounds like an out of tune kazoo compared to the other instruments. <br /> <br />I don't understand the raves about this album.  They sound a little like idol worship.  The band is country.  They are obviously tight, but it ain't the London Philharmonic.  The playing on many of Dylan's other albums is just as fine. <br /> <br />So send me some lyric sheets, and I'll raise the number of stars to 3.
B0000242A9|4.0|As a huge Depeche Mode fan this wasn't honestly an initial favorite. I found the \\"bonus\\" tracks weighed down the material and that some of the songs were more self-indulgent than the album's title suggested. But that doesn't mean that there was not any selling points and there are some real classics in here. Or maybe it's because there's nothing like \\"Some Great Reward\\" or \\"Black Celebration\\", even \\"Violator\\" after it.    But \\"Music for the Masses\\" is a great creative point and it's great how this got them so big. And the music really is as ambitious as the title. \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" sets the tone for the record, first with guitars and into its keyboard hooks and a more moody chorus, even if some lyrics are a bit WTF (\\"Promise me I'm as safe as houses/As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers\\" - and Gore is usually tops at this sort of thing). But the rest of the song more than makes up for it. I always wish they had used the Split Mix over the original. I suggest you look for it if you don't have it yet.    \\"Strangelove\\" is the album's real shining star, though. It has a more reflective and personal feel like the rest of the album. Yet it is also very moving. Not as immediately catchy as some of the poppier earlier stuff. \\"Behind the Wheel\\" shows the group's continued love for industrial that began with \\"Construction Time Again.\\" It is as moving as the driving title and builds up quite nicely. It seems quirky at first but is also an accessible moment of the album.    But the three singles, great as they are, aren't the only thunder on the album. \\"The Things You Said,\\" sung by Gore, is just gorgeous and warrants repeat listens. I like the double-tracked vocals in the chorus, too. \\"To Have and to Hold\\" is a black sheep of the album. At first I couldn't get into it because of the distraction of that Russian broadcast thing, but it got better as I heard it. It is a very deep track that specifically longs for love. The thing about this one as opposed to most DM songs is that instead of following a verse/chorus format, it is just one long verse. There is music ascending and descending from the point but that verse is the meat of the song. Deftones did the song some real justice about a decade later. \\"Pimpf\\" shows that the choral samples didn't end with the last album and it continued at times. I can see why they opened with the track even if it was the closer on the inital album.    \\"Sacred\\" is where Martin puts religion more into songs and you hear Dave and him singing together on the chorus, which usually works quite well. Not one of the best songs here but definitely worthy of listens. I also enjoy the more standard album track \\"Nothing,\\" which is translated better in its live versions. A simple message but a nice track to listen to during the middling feelings of your day. But where a song like \\"Something to Do\\" is more lively, this is more like a bored goth wallowing in the moment.    I'm still not too fond of \\"Little 15\\" which while it may be some grand epic has always bored me. Apparently the guys aren't fond of it either and haven't performed it live. \\"I Want You Now\\" just doesn't do it for me, even after getting over the whole breathing/double entendre background. Some moments are just hard to embrace. At least it's not the bulk of the album.    The \\"bonus tracks\\" aren't really that special, honestly. \\"Pleasure, Little Treasure\\" isn't listed as its actual Glitter Mix and honestly the regular version was better. It's still decent here though. \\"Agent Orange\\" is an amazing example of their experimenting.    I personally recommend many of their albums over this one, but it is still quality material. Some fans like it considerably more than I, but I suggest to maybe check others out first. Mid-late '80's' greatest synth act, although it doesn't properly fit a true label.
0061122416|3.0|Not that there's anything wrong with that.  It was a cute book and a good fable about following your dreams and creating your own reality with the power of your mind and the strength of your spirit.  I enjoyed it.<br /><br />But, I enjoyed the Greatest Salesman in the World and the Power of Positive Thinking as well.  It's just that they're sold as what they are:  motivational books.  The Alchemist's plot is too simplistic and predictable and the writing too juvenile for it to be a great novel.<br /><br />Read it and feel good about yourself and go out to live your dreams.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|\\"Modern Times\\" is astonishing. It bears repeated listening, and each time reveals something more of its depth. I have most of the Dylan catalogue, and I cant think of a better album of his, even \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", et. al. The quality of \\"Modern Times\\" is sustained across the entirety of the work, the poetic language is mature, dark and dramatic, the music is resonant and filled with the echoes of endless American musics. The title is perfect irony. Here is a musical classicism of an age-old, ageless America, that like Dylan's voice croaks with antiquity and yet is timeless. The underlay of the tracks is peppered with what might be snippets of music from the 1920s, the 1940s, the Civil War, the 1950s, and yet which hover outside of time in a Platonic realm of musical recollection where time is effaced by a glimpse of the transcendental, not unlike what Charles Ives, another great American master, acheived. In short, brilliant.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|What a change from the music of today. Ms. Rae has such a fluid sound and a laid back, feel-good quality about her. The album is a great and in case you're wondering - this lady sounds just as wonderful live. I saw her live in San Diego at a very small venue. Smashing performance! Can't wait to hear more from this voice.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|wow!!!! thats what comes to mind when i hear this cd ,it is hard to belive it has been over twenty years since madien graced us with the birth of eddie and yet they still can sell out a major venues and events, with all the nay sayers and none belivers in metal, well here is there rude awakening, metal is here to stay and madien is leading the charge and they are a big reason that its still a main stay in todays music, if that is what you want to call the rest of it, but not all worry this is a tremendous cd it is nothing short of a master piece, it is nothing like the last couple that have come out, but a true step in returning to form and style which made maiden every thing it was and stood for with epic song after epic song not just one or two but several, now dont get me wrong this is no number of the beast ,or piece of mind, or power slave but what it is a a cd that has that old maiden feelto it, like a cross between seventh son and some where in time and brave new world .with the return of adrian smith and bruce this band is back on track to take the metal world on once again ,the cd was well produced and the drums stick just as they did in the past and that driven thumping of the bass and the 3 guitar leads and bruces vocals sound as fresh as they ever had, i cant say that i have one favorite song for me because every time i listen to i find another break down that just blows my mind, then i love it all over again ,trust me when i tell you maide has taken great strides forward to return to its former self and not just living in its own shadow, so up the irons mate and bang thy head metal forever ...................09/16/2006......hope this was helpful!!!!!!!!!!

B000H7JD4K|5.0|Wow I must say maiden really pushed themselves to the limit on this one. I mean this album is so full of energy and Bruce Dickinson really gives it his all on this one. I thought Brave New World and Dance of Death were both great albums. But after a few listens I found both albums had a least four songs that did not do much for me. This album I listened to a lot and I found that every song is really good. Also like I said Bruce Dickinson really gives it his all on this one. He seems to put more energy into his vocals like he did in the old days. The last two albums had the energy but not like this. Also what I liked about this album is it is very fresh sounding. I thought Brave New World and Dance Of Death had a very similar sound. But this album is all together different but still keeping that Maiden tradition. But in closing I think this is the best album Maiden has released in years almost as good as Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son but in a different way. But Maiden fans don't pass this album up I don't think you will be dissapointed.

B000002GXX|4.0|Aside from the following review, the most important note I'd offer on this CD is the sound quality. It's slightly inconsistent. There are a couple of songs where the highs are lacking and the song sounds muffled, the best example being my favorite song on the CD, \\"The Hollywood Waltz.\\" There are a couple other songs that are affected to a lesser degree, but there is some inconsistency. I anticipate remastered versions of all their CDs, but especially this one. That said, my review: I've always loved the Eagles' earlier albums/CDs because they were edgier and more multifaceted. You could always count on some solid guitar work, a little southern flavor, and, yes, some gorgeous ballads. To be fair, some of my favorite songs by the Eagles are just that- \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling, Best of My Love,\\" and \\"Hollywood Watlz (from this CD) stick out the most up to this point. But those songs were never at the expense of what made them the Southern Californian sound stalwarts they'd become. Solid rocking songs like \\"Outlaw Man, James Dean,\\" and from this CD the  title song and \\"Too Many Hands\\" fit that mold to a tee.  And going down the unbeaten path was not beneath them neither, as songs from previous CDs like \\"Bitter Creek\\" and \\"Ol' 55\\", or from this CD gems like \\"Journey of The Sorcerer\\" and \\"Visions\\" would indicate. So mellow sounds like \\"I Wish You Peace\\" and \\"After the Thrill is Gone\\" come as no surprise to this CD as well. That was always the appeal to the large demographic of a fan base that they had built. But the Eagles like so many in rock history couldn't resist (and who could fault them) catering to what seemed to appeal the most- their \\"soft rock ballads.\\" That in itself isn't so bad. They were as good at that as anyone. But Infusing Joe Walsh into the nix didn't guarantee a rocking angle. It may have given them one solid Walsh rocker of a contribution in \\"In The City.\\" But future CDs included less and less of such tunes. Instead they offset their ballads with \\"powerballads,\\" the very ridicule of so many bands in the 80s. In that, this CD was the turning point for the Eagles. Though their following was to grow exponentially, they lost many who were fans of their earlier works after this CD, or at least became less appealing in their eyes. For lack of a better comparison, handing the reigns over to Don Henley- who was good at what he did- did for the Eagles what giving Phil Colliins more and more input did for Genesis. It didn't make for bad music, especially initially, but it went more for pop radio play. After \\"One of These Nights\\" if they didn't produce ballads, they produced mere pop, with rare exceptions. In that, \\"One of These Nights\\" holds a special place in my heart, starting off with a non-stop, seven song assault of various flavors. Again, I don't dislike their future ballads. They're some of my favorite songs. But their identity depended too much on that for appeal, as the make-up of their concert demographic would indicate. I challenge anyone to play this CD, then play \\"Hotel California,\\" and \\"The Long Run\\":. Though they'd include songs of  the Eagles original identiy, while appealing, I've always  considered songs like \\"Heartache Tonight, New Kid In Town,\\" and \\"The Long Run,\\" as pop at best, While songs like \\"Greeks Don't Want No Freaks\\" and \\"Disco Strangler\\" are simply unusual. Some would call that selling out. I don't necessarily go that far. But they had strayed far from their many angled sounds of past albums. Like most bands the Eagles had evolved. Whether that was for better or worse is purely subjective. That this CD was the last of it's kind isn't. I own all of their CDs, though I didn't buy the milquetoast \\"Hell Freezes Over,\\" nor any of their subsequent \\"greatest hits\\" reincarnations. I like them all on their own merit, I simply liked it when they also used to rock a little more.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|If George Lucas wants to tinker with his films until he dies I don't have a problem with that as long as he makes the films that fans fell in love with available. Finally we get the unaltered original \\"Star Wars\\". There's no new digital effects, no additions to the plot and we also get the digitally enhanced, altered version in the same package. So how does the picture look for the 1977 version? It looks fair compared to current standards for DVD. Using the original 1993 transfers for laserdisc as the source Lucasfilm cleaned up the original a bit in preparation for its DVD debut. It's not presented in anamorphic widescreen (which means the picture quality isn't as good as for the other version. That translates to less lines of resolution and a less sharp picture overall). Colors are inconsistent but considering the age of the film that's not surprising. The images are darker and there's a lot of film grain evident again no surprise. It's a pity that the film wasn't cleaned up more and restored for its DVD debut but we'll probably see some enhancement in that area (one hopes) in the deluxe boxed set that Lucas plans next year for the 30th Anniversary of Star Wars.<br /><br />I do find it disturbing though that Lucas made no effort to restore the film. It's almost like a spoiled child giving you something you've asked for. They DO hand it over but there's a lot of pouting and it's clear that it's not something they want to do. I would think that Lucas who grew up on classic horror, science fiction and adventure films would appreciate wanting the films the same way that he remembers them. It's a way to relive those childhood moments and pass them on to your children as well. I would still think that he's proud of his accomplishment of turning a $10 million movie into a $200 million + blockbuster that connected with audiences and present it in the best way possible (much how \\"Veritgo\\" or even \\"Touch of Evil\\" were restored for home video). I'd suggest a nice long talk with Robert Harris who restored \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Vertigo\\". 3 stars for the image and sound quality of the first film 5 stars for the second.<br /><br />The digitally enhanced version looks terrific. I didn't see any differences here compared to the previous release. It's basically the same transfer as before with the same extras as the previous release of a couple of years ago.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|This album is in every way fantastic.  The swing and soul of his compositions are just so easy to listen to and get lost in.  He has done a great job of breaking the mold yet again.  His music is very much sould and blues; very easy but also melodically entising. <br /> <br />Of course good melodies aren't everything and Mayer really comes through with deep emotional lyrics.  He has that key aspect that makes ANY artist - scratch that, any person inspiring and great: he allows his audiance to deeply feel his thoughts and emotions.  My personal favorite at the moment is \\"Stop This Train\\".  The music just feels like a train speeding right along, blissfuly and peacfuly out of anyone's control.  I was very moved by this album. <br /> <br />Just as some advice: do not try to listen to this album on a poor set of speakers or headphones.  These melodies deserve nothing less than a good pair of speakers or headphones.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I have been a Dylan fan since his first album, Bob Dylan. I have lived through all the changes that this man has gone through and put me through. Now down to business. <br /> <br />Dylan is not the Dylan of the earlier years. However, this third part of the \\"trilogy\\" is very good. He's cranky, unfortunately still religious, and still commenting on the world we live in. The music is laid back blues, country and jazz tinged and some rock and roll thrown in for good measure. Most of the time his lyrics make sense and even offer insights, sometimes they just rhyme. I find myself listening to this album a lot. The songs I particularly like are \\"Thunder on the Mountain,\\" and \\"Workingman's Blues, # 2.\\" the latter song is as political as the old Bob is gonna get, he even mentions the \\"proletariat\\" and \\"fight on the front line.\\"  <br /> <br />You can't go back in time, except to listen to his old stuff, which is still far superior to his new stuff. But this ain't half bad and much better than most of the other pop stuff being produced. I'll see you at the Meadowlands Bob.
B000FZETKC|4.0|The new issue has some good extras, including a commentary track by the director and Lea Thompson and retrospective interviews with the whole cast.  However, the picture transfer quality is pretty poor.  My copy had quite a bit of dropout.  Not sure if that's an issue with the negative or transfer process.  With a better picture this would be a great DVD.
0393057658|5.0|I'm not a baseball fan.  Hockey is the game of my heart.  Baseball?  No way.  But, I loved this book.  The only other baseball book that I've ever read that comes close to this high-water mark is Ball Four by Jim Bouton.  Funny and interesting in its own right.  A real joy to read.<br /><br />Great characters and insight to management.  A wonderful story about tearing down a culture from the inside.  And who can argue with the Oakland A's success?  Here it is September 2006 and they're once again leading their division, 5 games up on the Angels ... and this is the inside track on how they've done it with one of the worst payrolls in baseball.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Rarely do I hear an album as languid as Death Cab's 'Plans'.  It's just so dull.  Yet, impossible to dislike.  The production is crisp and the structure simplistic; the songs are likable but depressingly disposable.  Though there are some goodies (the sweet, placid \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\"), don't expect anything as impressive as, oh, the epic, longing title track from the band's previous release, 'Transatlanticism'.  These guys are talented, but 'Plans' seems dereft of true inspiration, yet because they know what they're doing and are well aware that their sound is practically fail-safe among the general public (I meet more Death Cab fans than possibly any other band known to man -- indie or not), why not take the oppurtunity to get a little personal free time, rather than devoting all your known time and energy to producing another hefty recording?  I'm sure all successful musicians have acted on such impulses, or at minimum found themselves tempted at the thought. <br /> <br />To be fair the songs range from listenable to near-great, the highlights being the above-mentioned \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\", the quick-tempo, piano laden \\"What Sarah Said\\", and the bass driven \\"Someday You Will Be Loved\\", which features one of the album's catchiest choruses.  \\"Different Names\\" is painfully boring up until the halfway point, when it surprisingly takes a commanding direction.  Frankly I'm undecided on the album's chosen single, \\"Soul Meets Body\\", which spouts some pretty banal lyrics and really nothing overtly impressive musically. Then again, it somehow managed to cling to my brain with time, and I repeatedly found myself wandering through the space where it unwillingly took a seat under my skin.  Guess that's worth something.   <br /> <br />Overall though it's just, forgetable. With this and \\"Transatlanticism\\", I've come to the conclusion that Death Cab is a merely good band, but a band that rarely crosses into that truly special territory.  Personally, I could list a number of indie bands that I prefer more, but of course everyone has different tastes.  And, along the lines of \\"emo\\", which I'm not sure Death Cab really claims themselves to be (I mention it because I've oft heard the label stamped on 'em), there's a good deal of bands that provide far greater emotional impact, with a lesser degree of sentimentality and self-indulgance.  Nonetheless, Death Cab is both accessible and very often enjoyable, and when all is said and done, I still like them quite a bit.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|Once again, George Lucas thumbs his nose at the most die-hard fans of the original Star Wars Trilogy. <br /> <br />When these films were FINALLY scheduled to be released on DVD in 2004, I was elated. At last, I would be able to own these 3 classic films in digital format, with superior picture quality, superior sound - and what I most eagerly awaited - digital correction of color shifting and elimination of glitches in the old blue-screen process (most noticeable around tie fighters in some battle scenes). What I received for my patience turned my stomach. Yes, the picture and sound were enhanced - wonderful. But instead of using advances in digital technology to correct flaws in the original films, all Lucas did was add incredibly annoying slapstick CG creatures, rework scenes that had been reworked once before in the 1997 theatrical releases (George, the hangar scene with Jabba will never work, and was completely unnecessary to begin with - give it up already!) and generally fiddle with CONTENT as opposed to improving QUALITY.  <br /> <br />Yes, I know Lucas has said he simply made the films closer to what he had wanted to create in the first place. All I can say is that I am eternally grateful he did NOT get to make \\"the films he wanted to make\\" in 77, 80 and 83. It is precisely the limitations of the technology at the time that made him dig down and innovate and improvise as best he could. He was forced to be more resourceful. And that resourcefulness is why those original films are so superior to the \\"reworked\\" versions as well as vastly superior to the second trilogy. Lucas' main flaw as a filmmaker is that he becomes too entranced with technology and gimmickery. That is why the second trilogy, while visually impressive, was so obsessive about CG that other concerns like story and performances were clearly (and shamefully) reduced to afterthoughts. If films can be called \\"lazy,\\" then those were lazy films. <br /> <br />I wanted the original versions, and not the monkeyed-with versions (which I absolutely cannot watch). I wanted them because I was a kid when these films origially came out in theatres. I saw them repeatedly in their first runs. And the thing about films like those is that they have a cadence to them - a progression and rhythm from one scene to the next that you get used to and that becomes familiar to you. These films become old friends that you know and recognize. And any interruption in that cadence by fiddling with content makes them feel like strangers.  I wanted my old friends back. <br /> <br />So now, finally, the Original Theatrical Versions are available on DVD for the first time. I wasted no time in picking them up. And once again, I feel shafted. Is it really asking so much to have the original films in anamorphic widescreen and 5.1 Surround? And Lucas STILL hasn't bothered to correct any of the blue-screen glitches!!!!!! I could burn a good VHS copy to DVD and get about the same results. This is Lucas' response to the clamouring from his oldest and most die-hard fans for the original versions? Such a response feels nothing less than spiteful.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|I saw Maiden several times starting with the Piece of Mind tour, been a fan since the first cd came out.  I have to say this cd is a welcome return to the old mightly Maiden where nearly every song is perfect.  I love the long tunes now as Maiden cannot write a short classic any longer they always seem to sound rehashed to me.  I LOVED BNW and I HATED DoD!!!  This release is up there with Brave New World!  Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, Legacy, and several others will be humming in your brain all day and night.  Bruce still sounds better than any singer out there, bar none! There may not be a fast Aces High on here but this is brilliant Maiden, no question!!!!!!!!!!
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Like several other reviewers I was a bit unimpressed upon first listening. Everything sounded a bit slow and dreary and I missed old happy light pop/rock Mayer. But, after a couple of listens these songs will seep in and you'll realize how great this disc really is. Also as far as lyrics he's grown leeps and bounds. Favorites include: I Don't Trust Myself (with Loving You)--music is SICK on this, Gravity, Stop This Train, Heart of Life, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, and last but not least Belief (I couldn't agree more with his lyrics, wish we could get Bush to sit and take a listen). Anyway, Mayer has certainly grown, and after a couple of listens most will agree that this album while different, certainly can stand up to his previous work. <br /> <br />Oh, and Vultures is great too!  <br />

B000GFLAI0|4.0|I'm giving this four out of five stars just because, as haunting and beautiful as this is, I'm not going to make any claim that it's the secong coming of Highway 61 Revisited or Blood on the Tracks (let alone Blonde on Blonde). Of course, no one ever said that he ever tries to do anything resembling going back to any earlier style or statement....That said, I am finding that this one really grows on you. So who knows how it'll sound in a year, five years, twenty years..... <br /> <br />My sole analytical observation is that, beyond all the obvious blues and crypto-americana influences here, I feel that quite a few moments sound as though Bob's been deeply affected by Leonard Cohen (a good thing, in my opinion). Particularly in \\"Ain't Talkin\\". <br /> <br />Enjoy. Or not. Won't affect my pleasure either way. <br />
074325144X|3.0|A decent book with some interesting ideas, but little to do with anything \\"Chi,\\" which was a little disappointing.    The underlying emphasis throughout this book is on competition, even though usually unstated. It's all about technique. He advocates using as little leg muscle as possible. Specifically, one does not push off using the toes or propel the body using the leg muscles like a sprinter might do. Instead, the only muscle action of the legs is to pick themselves up. He uses a good illustration: stand straight and fall forward. Instinctively, one of your legs will swing forward to catch you. I you use ONLY this muscle action, you'll have the basis of this book's technique.    In addition, he advises you engage your core muscles and maintain an erect, proper posture. (That's good advice because it keeps your body from getting sloppy.) His advice for deep, rhythmic breathing and for relaxing the body overall are sound. The arms swing loosely and to the rear which opens up the chest for better breating.     It is important to focus on what our body and our breath are doing as we run (and not be distracted by our normal day-to-day thoughts). This makes running almost like meditating, which in my opinion is a good thing.     I'm trying this technique in my regular runs and so far it seems \\"interesting,\\" but no final verdict yet.    Some advice sounds a little dubious. For example, he advises pronaters (whose feet strike the ground not parallel to their path) to force their feet parallel to avoid injury. I'm certainly no expert, but seems to me that forcing a natural pronation to an unnatural angle might itself lead to injury. In any case, I'd certainly want to see some clinical studies before adopting this advice.    Now for a few disappointments.    I've run mostly for pleasure for almost 40 years, and while the book's premise sounds appealing, there are some seeming contradictions. It opens with an image of children running in a schoolyard with a description about how we should all seek to run naturally, free, and unfettered, for the sheer joy of running, just like those kids. It them proceeds through 200+ pages to lay out dozens upon dozens upon dozens (seemingly) of detailed rules about how we should run, including how we should hold our thumbs. It advises we carry a metronome so the that we run exactly X paces per second. Well, I doubt those kids studied any such list or carry pacers. Something just does not add up here.    Implicit in this book is that we let our body tell us the style in which we run as well as how far and fast, but there's almost no follow through on this theme. Instead he presents a detailed, one-size-fits-all running style that (at least in my opinion) is not necessarily what our bodies might tell us to do. There's no room for different body types or running styles.    This style may indeed benefit some runners who have certain physical situations. If you are one of those then his techiques are certainly worth a try. Hope they help. But I'm not convinced this style is for everyone.    There's supposed to be a deep connection with Ti Chi, but apart from a few  oblique references to the Chi energy, there is precious little actual discussion of this topic.     And there's this Chi energy itself. I personally don't believe in it (although I would not disparage those who do). In any case, it has really nothing to do with what's taught in the book.    Although this is certainly not the author's fault, this is one of those cases where the advice might best be presented in \\"20 pages or less.\\" But 20-page books don't sell for enough money to make any profit. And so they are padded with redundandent and generally useless information. Again, not his problem, but this makes the book a bit tedious to read.    In summary, the specific technique he advocates is worth a try. Much of the advice is fine: that we run for the sheer joy and fun of it, that we constantly listen to our bodies and let them guide us to a relaxed and stress-free running style, that we angage our core muscles and maintain a nice posture, that we breath deeply and rhythmically, and that we relax everything we can. But in the end this is mostly a running-style book -- not having much to do with anything mystical, like Chi.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|After watching this highly superior epic four times in succession I attempted to revise and edit my first review, upwards, but Amazon wasn't having it; so I scrapped it, and now start again.     To anyone familiar with Homeric legend there is much that is disconcerting about this telling of the story, which is different from the Iliad, although using numerous characters and incidents from the ancient Greek original --- not that the Iliad itself was original in the sense one might assume. These stories had been told and re-told, each bard adding and omitting to suit his audience and his own temperament. There seems nothing wrong, therefore, for a modern team of writer and film director to do their own thing, especially as they have deliberately changed the title of their tale, making it quite clear that they are not aiming to reproduce the classic Iliad. Any criticism which complains that Benioff and Petersen don't precisely follow Homer (if he ever existed) is barking up the wrong tree.     This is a stunning, intriguing and fascinating movie in its own right. At first one may be taken aback, for other reasons besides its deviation from its inspiration. The dialogue is curiously throwaway and informal, to anyone brought up on the sententiously stilted posturing and declaiming of traditional celluloid epics. A number of reviewers are annoyed by what they regard as the inaccuracies and anachronisms of social life, battle techniques, armour, equipment and so forth. The fact is that no one is quite sure when, if ever, the famous siege of Troy took place --- and there is even some doubt as to where. All that is certain is that it was in the past; a long, long, time ago. This aspect is conveyed with tremendous effect. At the same time, the actions, motivations, behaviour and psychology of the individuals is bang up-to-date, and extremely convincing. The political power-play, the arrogant insubordination of Achilles, the dependency and resentful hatred of the boss, ring true. Achilles' petulance is a strong and crucial feature of the familiar version. Brad Pitt's performance, and ability to convey his utter superiority as a killing machine on the battle-field, is exceptional. The fact is that the Iliad itself centres on Achilles; his grimly fatalistic attitude, and his acceptance of a short, spectacular life instead of unmemorable longevity.     The absence of the Gods is complained of. I didn't feel this in any way at all. The Gods are present in this movie, just as much as they are in Homer. No contemporary actually imagined that Aphrodite, Ares, Apollo and the rest appeared on the battlefield. They were conscious, however, of how little men could do to take charge of their own destinies. The hidden presence of the Gods was finely suggested: these ancient humans are presented as if in the grip of outside forces. They are doomed by fate to act out their given roles, which the Gods have decided for them. Freedom and choice were illusory. They still are --- although we are obliged to believe that we are in control of our own lives.     Some reviewers have criticized the performances of Paris and Helen. I don't get it. The actress is beautiful, and that is all she has to be. She is merely the face that launched the thousand ships: the excuse for the war, not the real reason. Her changing expressions as she enters Troy for the first time speak volumes. Paris is a feckless playboy, a lover not a fighter, but a good archer.     This film is stuffed with mind-expanding ideas, superb performances, spectacular action and scenery. The computer graphics are inevitable, these days, but they do conjure up powerful images. This is certainly one of the best epics I have seen --- perhaps the very best; and I'm astonished by the number of negative reviews.
0679721037|5.0|When the atomic bomb dropped at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, Hiroshima was a thriving city of two hundred forty-five thousand people.  By 8:20, one hundred thousand of those people were dead.  Combining the broad perspective of the absolute devastation of the city with the tiniest details of six individual lives, John Hersey provides a powerful closeup of a few survivors of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, giving the carnage a human perspective.<br /><br />Focusing on  Mr. Tanimoto, a Methodist pastor; Mrs. Nakamura, the widow of a tailor, and her three children;  Dr. Masakazu Fujii, a physician in a private clinic; Fr. Wilhelm Kleinsorge, S. J, a priest in a Catholic mission; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young surgeon at the Red Cross Hospital; and Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in a tin works, as they survive the initial attack,  the author follows their daily movements, their subsequent illnesses, their fears, and the eventual outcomes of their lives.  The victims become human, and their concerns become universal, as Hersey shows them digging themselves out and helping their neighbors, filled with an \\"elated community spirit\\" in the days and weeks after the bombing.<br /><br />Details of the fires following the bombing, the unexpected radiation sickness, the mysteries surrounding the kind of bomb this was (some Japanese believed that the allies had sprinkled powdered magnesium over the city and then ignited it), the devastating rains that followed, and the monumental scale of the damage are presented in straightforward, factual style, the horrors of the reality so overwhelming that Hersey had no need to try to control his narrative by selecting details or ordering them for effect.<br /><br />Published in the New Yorker in August, 1946, this anniversary remembrance had immediate and dramatic repercussions, perhaps because the focus on \\"ordinary\\" Japanese citizens, much like the Americans who read the article, as opposed to \\"the enemy,\\" resonated with his readers.  Thousands listened to four days of its reading on ABC radio, and many others bought the New Yorker to read his account.  By raising also the question of the ethics of dropping such a bomb (which some of the Japanese agree was acceptable as a normal part of the war), he also forces his readers to consider the long-term implications of atomic warfare.  Dramatic, powerful, and very personal, this account of six lives, changed forever, is a monument to the human spirit in the face of incredible adversity. n Mary Whippleits reading on ABC radio, and many others bought the New Yorker to read his account.

1573921394|5.0|The General Theory is the main work of Keynes and his theory, which is was written to distinguish himself from the classical theory. The style is fairly hard to read, as the language is not easy and the contents obviously very advanced. Nevertheless, reading this book is worth the efforts, as the theory (so often very badly taught at schools and universities) becomes crystal clear. At the same time, it is a book that should ideally be read by someone who has at least got some basics in Economics, as otherwise the book may seem too hard.<br /><br />When reading this book, we further gain direct insight into the mind of a beautiful mind. The style, although difficult, is that of a current of thoughts, which shows us how profoundly this man was able to think about very complex matters. It is truly one of the most important writings in the fields of Economics, but also a show case of pure genious.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I know lots of people don't like Green Day because of the songs on this album being overplayed. I admit that the song American Idiot was way overrated and has gotten annoying over the years. But this album is still excellent. There's not one song on it that I skip.  <br /> <br />American Idiot 3/5- Like I just said it was good at first, then lost some of it's excellence because the radios overplayed it. Not Green Day's fault. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia 5/5- Probably the best song on the album! This was the first song I heard on the album and it rocked then, it still rocks now! <br /> <br />Holiday 5/5- Another great song on the album, the bass and guitar and drums are awesome in this song. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams 5/5- A little overplayed, but still awesome. It was one of the songs that convinced me to buy this album. <br /> <br />Are We The Waiting 4/5- Not as good as the rest and a little repetitive in my opinion, but leads right into a punk rockin song! <br /> <br />St. Jimmy 5/5- The punkest song on the album! Rocks out loud. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine 5/5- Love the chorus, love the melody, awesome. <br /> <br />She's A Rebel 4/5- Repetitive but still pretty awesome! One of my friends favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl 3/5- Not quite on extraordinary song, but not bad at all. <br /> <br />Letterbomb 5/5- AWESOME!! I think this song is underrated but it's definately my second favorite to Jesus of Suburbia. Also Billie Joe's favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends 5/5- Overplayed but that doesn't matter still a really great song. I love the part when the bass drums and overdrive pick up.  <br /> <br />Homecoming 5/5- Not as good as Jesus of Sububia, but still a great rock opera. <br /> <br />Whatsername 5/5- A great piece of music, but I think Homecoming should've been the final track.   <br /> <br />If you look at my ratings most were 5/5. If you don't already have the album you should definately not pass this one by! I really really like this album. Get it!
B000003N7R|4.0|The album starts with one of the greatest versions of a jazz song - \\"In A Sentimental Mood\\".  Coltrane's playing on it is brilliant, and Duke's piano playing sounds much better than in the 1941 version of the same song.  The bass & drum alternate between Duke's & John's.  At the tempos and volumes they're playing at, there isn't a significant difference between the two sets.  Coltrane's playing is a slight retreat in terms of adventurousness.  It may have been mouthpiece problems or maybe because he was playing with Duke Ellington.  Either way, it's lack of challenge doesn't diminish the beauty of the playing.  Some have said Duke sounds more modern than Coltrane, but I don't hear that.  This album won't turn your personal jazz world on its ear, but it is a lot of fun to listen to.  It's also fine for non-jazz fans.

They are definately slower then they used to be, but slower for Slayer is still faster then a lot of bands out there. The thing I love about them is that you are never going to be surprised, they have their own sound and stick with it. My favorite is track 5, but I love all the songs. I just hope it's not another 5 years before they do another albulm.
B000GPI2EK|4.0|This is almost the perfect heavy metal album.   Mastodon takes a step forward from Leviathan, with music that is heavier, more intense, and consistantly awesome riffs.  Since Mastodon is now on a major label, the sound of the album is a little better.  The only reason to give 4 stars instead of 5?  They still haven't figured out what to do with the vocals.  I don't mind hearing yelling and screaming, but it's typically indistinct and hard to figure out what they're yelling about.  But instrumentally, this album is head and shoulders above anything else. Highly recommended, and if you don't care vocals, you'll love it even more.

I also remember how great the band sounded in concert, and this live album from 1995, \\"Pulse,\\" documents the Floyd on their \\"Division Bell\\" tour in all of it's sonic glory. I think it's a better live album than \\"The Delicate Sound Of Thunder,\\" too. There's a better selection of songs, and the band themselves sound better on this one, their performances very tight and clean throughout. And Gilmour's voice has also improved immensely since \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder,\\" where he *growled* the words too damn much instead of singing them (Gilmour was also a lot heavier on that previous tour---the weight loss definitely did him good in more ways than one!). And, of course, there's the complete live performance of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" which is marvelously done. Not only that, but \\"Pulse\\" also boasts incredible packaging. I LOVE the beautiful accompanying tour book and cover artwork! It's really well done. The only thing missing from Pink Floyd's \\"Pulse\\" is Roger Waters, although Guy Pratt does a good job filling in for Waters on bass (and his co-lead vocal with Gilmour on \\"Run Like Hell\\" is also a big improvement from his previous try on \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder,\\" which sounded too ragged. This time around, Pratt gets it right). While I'm disappointed that David Gilmour, reportedly, cannot be swayed into touring and recording with Pink Floyd anymore---he says it wouldn't make him \\"a happier person\\" to do Pink Floyd again---I am happy that at least the Floyd went out with a great album and tour. \\"The Division Bell\\" is an excellent album, and \\"Pulse\\" is an equally-excellent live document from the tour. If you gotta go out, go out on top, and Pink Floyd definitely did just that. Long live the mighty Pink Floyd!
B00023B1LC|2.0|I enjoyed both the book and the movie. The movie, fortunately, bears virtually no relationship in plotting to the book, as the book would be out-dated (or, use intelligence-community jargon, \\"overtaken by events\\"). <br /> <br />The \\"Explosive Extended Edition\\" is, by amazing coincidence, exactly the same length as the UNExplosive, UNExtended Edition. <br /> <br />I had thought the \\"EEE\\" would be the Director's Cut, or something similar.  It is not. <br /> <br />If you already own the original DVD version, purchasing this would be a waste of your money, unless you want to buy a back-up copy. <br /> <br />Still, I hope plans are in the works to film \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", the 3rd of the Bourne trilogy.  (There is also a 4th book, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\", but that was not written by Robert Ludlum.)
B000GFLAI0|5.0|It seems that some other people are offended that some would like this album so much that they would give it 5 stars. That won't deter me from giving this album the praise that I think it deserves, though. (and I'm sorry that those who didn't like the album lost their 15 bucks)... <br /> <br />Anyway, on to the music... on first listen, I was unimpressed and dissapointed, and would've been ready and willing to agree with some of the those below who didn't like the album. But after a few listens, something struck me. Something under the surface grabbed me and kept me coming back to this album again and again.  <br /> <br />\\"Spirit on the Water\\" is a fantastic song. The bluesy bassline of the song hooks you immediately on every listen, and you wanna stay for all 7 and a half minutes of its glory. \\"Rollin and Tumblin'\\" is another great one.. with it's abrasive guitar lick scratching you on every pass. \\"Someday Baby\\" (the song on the Ipod commercials) has the most hooks of any song on the album. <br /> <br />Those are pretty much the biggest highlights of the album for me. But I also quite like \\"Ain't Talkin'\\", \\"Nettie Moore\\", \\"Workingman's Blues\\", \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" and \\"When the Deal Goes Down\\". Unlike others, I haven't gotten that much into \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" and \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\", but they're both alright songs. <br /> <br />In short, I think this is the best album that Bob has put out in quite a long time. (since BOTT?) I've heard all of Bob's best work, and this album is not to be taken lightly.
B00004TH7Z|1.0|Lets get 1 fact out: <br />IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!! <br /> <br />How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor? <br /> <br />This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does \\"Dream of Mirrors\\" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with \\"Thin Line\\" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.  <br /> <br />You cant listen to the original \\"Iron Maiden\\" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE! <br /> <br />If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named \\"Too old, too tired!\\" & quit defiling the great name of \\"IRON MAIDEN\\"!
0192838679|4.0|Now like most folks I sort of remember the film adaptation (\\"Dangerous Liaisons\\") as a vaguely enjoyable but stuffy costume drama.  When some years ago a fellow seated next to me on a plane said \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" was the best book he has ever read I thought I'd give it a try.  Well I finally got around to reading it.  While it is decidedly NOT the best book ever it does have its moments. <br /> <br />The story involves a scheming pair of former lovers sharing their designs on capturing and destroying hearts of innocents around them.  I can see when this book was written over two hundred years ago it caused a great scandal.  While not explicit in language it leaves little doubt as to what is transpiring.  Just when our nasty duo get close to capturing their prey everything unravels in an unexpected way (..no spoilers here). <br /> <br />Since the story is told in a sequence of over one hundred letters between the characters I'd imagine most folks would find this format to be a major turn-off.  Admittedly the first half of the book is a bit tedious.  However the second half is quite engrossing, making this book well worth the effort. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: a unique book worthy of its reputation.  Recommended.
B000H7JD4K|1.0|As a long time fan of Iron Maiden, I can say after this album: I'm Done! This stuff is too difficult to listen to. I cant buy another one. This band cant write anymore & these efforts are inexcusable.  <br />Now in case the boring, tired riffs don't do it, my buddies at Iron Maiden decided to create an insomniacs dream in making these tracks around 8 minutes long. AUHG!!! <br />About X-factor in 1995 they took a wrong turn. All this music sounds alike. There is nothing distinguishing it from any other album or song they've done for the last 10 years.  <br />Normally when I think Maiden, I think \\"The Trooper\\", \\"Run to the Hills\\" & \\"Quest for Fire\\" but the crap in Brave New World & Virtual XI is crap that they do over & over again. Loathsome in that there is no change in tempo with these terrible tracks- all are at this slow metal blues- TERRIBLE! I cant tell one track from the next... Its just 1 hour 17 minutes of the same crummy song.  <br />From these bad records, they have usually had 1 good fast tempo track reminiscent of the old good Iron Maiden IE-\\"Man on the Edge\\" from a pool or really poor ones but this record has NOT ONE redeeming track. All 8 are a brain numbing total lack of energy.
B000G759LW|3.0|Ok, after reading all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to listen to this CD... unfortuantely,now, after having listened to it, I would have to argue that this is anything but her best work! Unlike with \\"Stripped\\", I cannot listen to this CD straight through because some songs are simply too irritating. There's no doubt that Christina is a talented artist, which ultimately shines through in songs like \\"Understand\\", \\"Here to Stay\\", and my favourite \\"Hurt\\", however, I think one disc would have been sufficient.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|First - Thank you George Lucas for releasing the original versions of Episodes IV, V and VI on DVD. I know it pained you - so thanks! <br /> <br />Now after watching these, my gut instinct tells me that this is it friends... There will be no HD or remastered releases of the original versions. Why? Because the quality is so below what Lucasfilm normally releases (it is embarrassing), George is telling us straight that the \\"real\\" version of his films exist on the 2004 versions - if you want the best audio/video experience, watch that version. Lucasfilm made no efforts to update the original version in any way. These are actually of lower quality than what we saw in the theatre because you can see the degraded film quality as well as compression artifacts - most likely because these are straight transfers from original laserdisc releases. <br /> <br />As a result, I got the impression I was watching a DVD from the 1980's or early 1990's. Am I being picky - you tell me... I could see the defects watching on a 32\\" standard CRT TV - not a HD flat screen - which would have made these looked even worse. For the best video experience, I recommend using a 12\\" color CRT TV. The audio experience was also sub-par with a decent speaker system. The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack remains unchanged and you really notice it when comparing it to the 2004 versions - it just sounds flat. <br /> <br />Now the good news... I will still only watch these original Star Wars versions because I still enjoyed the movie more compared to the 2004 counterparts. The originals still have their soul left intact where the 2004 versions feel more like the newer episodes (I, II & III) - technically & artistically impressive but missing the human touch. George - you are a master filmmaker but I fear you have become more intimate with the technology than with the audience (there is a great Darth Vader metaphor here but I digress...) <br /> <br />So yes - Han Solo shoots first with Greedo (good life lesson there) -I am left wondering who and what is this Jabba the Hut character (ahhh... a little mystery), etc. When Episode IV was over, I didn't miss any of the additions made to the 2004 versions - sorry George I didn't. The changes do not add anything to the story. In fact, other than the improved audio & video quality, all other changes are just distracting. George will win the end because the new generation will watch the 2004 versions and not even know what they missed. <br /> <br />I could go on but since these are limited versions and George will actually surprise us by *never* releasing remastered originals, I just may purchase a back-up copy so I don't have to pay $100 per DVD on eBay 5-10 years in the future when I need a new copy. <br /> <br />Thanks!
B000FQJAIW|3.0|Watching this was just like squeezing into the last row at the UA 150 in Seattle in 1977. <br /> <br />The old school sound.  (\\"What did he say?\\"\\"I dunno.\\") <br />This is an absolute artifact of the 1977 movie viewing experience.  The only thing that could make it more authentic would be a projector with film and a screen. <br /> <br />I saw Star Wars 27 times before it went into general release in the summer of '78.  I have watched it maybe six times since the IV A New Hope was slapped on it.  And then the little blippity bloopies and odd computer generated were added.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed watching this.  The movie was the shape I remembered.  The music drug a bit as it did before the soundtrack was remastered.  The cut out shapes that you notice after sitting through a movie a bazillion times.  I enjoyed a visit with an old friend that I hadn't seen for a long time, a long time.  Some people like the facelift of the movie, I like the wrinkles and sags in this version.  I thought I would never see it again. <br /> <br />I have a 42 inch plasma, and for me the original theatrical aspect was just dandy.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I don't think I've ever gotten into a show as soon as it premiered. Literally all my DVD sets are shows that aired long before I decided to check them out and through word of mouth you find out about the other ones. How did Veronica Mars come out? Mainly from people who were into Arrested Development, Lost and Smallville which I'm into already. Due to a non-supply and demand issue we didn't have season 1 but I got into season 2 and finally got a chance to watch season 1. It's a pretty strong season that's marred probably by a sense of build-up. <br /> <br />Taking place in a town called Neptune in California, high school student/super-sleuth Veronica Mars is not having a good year: her best friend, Lilly Kane, was murdered. Her dad, Keith Mars and sheriff at the time, had his job taken away when he went after Lilly's father as a suspect and Veronica had been drugged and raped at a party. While the murder/rape are the main season arcs, there's also little cases peppered throughout the season such as the kidnapping of a mascot, blackmail and parental disappearances. <br /> <br />It's strange but looking back on the season, I actually at times forgot what was in each episode. Sure I remember that scene where Veronica found out some important thing but for the life of me I couldn't tell you what episode it was. So in a weird way the show benefits from being watched start to finish but it's not like random click and go where you can watch whatever episode you felt like seeing. It's not a problem for the show but it is something I noticed, as well as with the second season. <br /> <br />Despite the fact that there's a lot of main characters, there's not a whole lot of development for them save a couple. While I'm not attacking their acting abilities, the Wallace and Duncan characters seem kind of bland. Best friend and former ex respectively, you'd think there'd be a lot more time spent getting to know them and get backstory but they're mainly there to serve the plot at that time. However of course we have Kristen Bell as the titular character, smart and sassy yet emotional. Jason Dohring is quite the one-liner man has he's quite the likable and charismatic guy Logan and Enrico Colantoli is arguably one of the best TV dad's who can be wise-cracking and caring yet tough and protective without being overbearing. <br /> <br />While the main arc of the murder is intriguing, the way it's presented is that it doesn't have that kind of rising action aspect of storytelling where you feel things starting to get more fast paced and climactic, instead saving it for the big finale. While the series doesn't limp towards the last episode for the season, it does feel like the episodes don't start to get compelling as you're going along but rather the feeling that just the fact you're nearing the end is compelling, not the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br />While it does look like I have a problem with this season, it's actually cause I mainly said negatives. It's a very intriguing and addictive show although I don't like its free-reign writing. Certain characters almost turn evil/good at the drop of a hat while the rape storyline which was \\"solved\\" here, is actually debunked and we find out the truth. However, you should definately pick this one up.
B000005RY7|3.0|A so-so Kiss compilation CD title. Total of twelve tracks - there undoubtedly should have been more. Tunes that I enjoyed hearing (once, again) were \\"Cold Gin\\", the ass-kicking anthem \\"Shout It Out Loud\\", \\"Nowhere To Run\\" (vaguely remember this cut), their stellar rocker \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and their 1979 disco tribute - the likable \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\". Obviously, 'Killers' is pretty much aimed toward the Kiss completists and die-hard fans. Believe, they are out there - in greater numbers than some might know.
0156030306|3.0|I have a feeling I would enjoy this story a lot more by viewing the movie or the play. The way the book was written is perfect for a screenplay. I quess I was expecting more pathos. Granted, the story was touching, but I never really felt connected with the writing style.
B000005RQT|5.0|Superbly done CD reissue of Deep Purple's 1970 landmark British hard rock album. Seriously, if you haven't heard of this lp, you either need to get out of the house more OR escape from the sanitarium that you're currently living in. Most memorable tracks here, of course are \\"Speed King\\", the ten minute epic \\"Child In Time\\", \\"Into The Fire\\" and the inspiring \\"Hard Loving Man\\". This EMI pressing comes with seven (7) bonus tracks, as songs + five bonus snippets of studio chit chat. This is GREAT! Absolutely essential.

B000002U9K|4.0|When one looks at the history of musical acts that can be categorized as \\"Dance Music\\" or \\"Disco\\", there are few acts that have achieved the success and longevity of the Pet Shop Boys.   The Pet Shop Boys have been making music for over 20 years - releasing an album usually about every one or two years.   In the UK, the Pet Shop Boys have consistently produced Top 10 albums.   They haven't had quite the same amount of success on American shores, but nonetheless they have still maintained a solid following.    It actually didn't start out like that for the Pet Shop Boys in the U.S.    They actually burst on to the music scene in 1986 with a #1 song entitled \\"West End Girls\\".    They would then follow \\"West End Girls\\" up with another hit - \\"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\\".     These two songs would be part of the debut - and most successful album by the Pet Shop Boys \\"Please\\". <br /> <br />Just because this album was the most successful album by the Pet Shop Boys doesn't mean that their career went downhill afterwards.   In fact, I would subscribe to the theory that \\"Please\\" would lay their foundation for the next two decades following its 1986 release.   It might be that many may judge the Pet Shop Boys' success in terms of the pop charts and not consider things from where their sweet spot is - the Dance charts.   \\"West End Girls\\" and \\"Opportunities\\" were songs that not only got airplay on the Pop and Dance clubs, but were even songs that got some airplay on some Rock stations.  Eventually the Pet Shop Boys would find their niche on the Dance charts - and would never look back.    The Pet Shop Boys came along at the end of the Classic Disco album.   While acts such as Madonna and Janet Jackson were emerging during this period, the Pet Shop Boys were bringing their own unique style - that being the \\"Euro Disco\\" style (i.e. a heavily electronic style in the mold of Giorgio Moroder).  In a lot of ways, \\"Please\\" made the Pet Shop Boys innovators in what was a new subgenre on the music scene. <br /> <br />The way the songs are ordered - they follow a loose concept.   The Pet Shop Boys apparently \\"escape\\" to London's West End.   They explore the West End, look for ways to make money, explore the suburbs, deal with Violence, and consistently explore love and relationships, and eventually contemplate the future. <br /> <br />\\"Two Divided by Zero\\": This song didn't exactly ignite me on fire.   I felt it was weak for an opening song.   I didn't care for the computer sounding \\"divided by\\" repetitions.  This song deals with looking for an \\"escape\\". <br /> <br />\\"West End Girls\\": This is one of those landmark songs.   Neil Tennant's does most of the song as a \\"rap\\" - and it works perfectly.  Tennant is fabulous with singing the chorus.  The \\"rap\\" provides a narrative.   While I'm not a rap, when it's used in an effective manner like in this song - it pays big.  Combine this with Euro sounding synthesizers and even some horn and you have a masterpiece.    One can make the argument that Madonna's \\"Jump\\" on her 2005 \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" album samples part of this song. <br /> <br />\\"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\\":  This song probably has a semi-autobiographic feel for Tennant and fellow Pet Shop Boy Chris Lowe.   Tennant provides a very believable \\"pitch\\" to convince a partner to join him in a business venture.  As per the lyrics, it appears that Tennant has had \\"enough of scheming and messing around with jerks\\" and is \\"looking for a partner; someone who gets things fixed\\".   The song almost a nice quasi-orchestral start before segueing into a Euro sounding melody.  I like the drum machine in this song. <br /> <br />\\"Love Comes Quickly\\": This has a classic \\"Euro\\" sound to it.   This song took a while to grow on me, but it did.  The line from this song \\"cause when you least expect it; waiting round the corner for you\\" combined with the song's title tells the whole story. <br /> <br />\\"Suburbia\\":  This song at times at a bit more of a pop feel.   The keyboards are terrific on this one - as well as the \\"suburban sound effects\\".   Tennant delivers a great commentary on life in the suburbs. <br /> <br />\\"Opportunities (reprise)\\":  This is a short reprise of \\"Opportunities\\".  It is all instrumental.   I wish this reprise was longer - because this song has you wanting more. <br /> <br />\\"Tonight is Forever\\": Not only does this song provide a classic \\"Euro\\" sound, but it also has a feel like Giorgio Moroder's music.   Very good track - I'm surprised it didn't get more attention on the club scene. <br /> <br />\\"Violence\\": This is a nice change of pace song.  For this song, the Pet Shop Boys employ a slight Funk influence.   They pull off this song perfectly. <br /> <br />\\"I Want a Lover\\": This song has a slight classical start to it, then like \\"Opportunities\\" it segues into a \\"Euro Disco\\" sound.   This is another underrated track. <br /> <br />\\"Later Tonight\\":  This song is sung as slow ballad with some electronic instrumentation.   Tennant's vocals are the story on this song as he pulls them off well. <br /> <br />\\"Why Don't We Live Together?\\": This song also has a \\"Euro\\" feel to it.   Tennant uses the \\"rap\\" angle again flawlessly on this track.  I'm also surprised this song didn't get more airplay in the dance clubs.  This song was the perfect \\"wrap-up\\" to this album. <br /> <br />Whether one subscribes to the \\"concept\\" of what \\"Please\\" offers or not, you can also make the argument that each song stands solid on their own.   I wish that the liner notes included the lyrics to each of the songs.    Overall, I found this to be an outstanding album.  If you especially like the \\"Euro Disco\\" sound, this would be an album I'd highly recommend.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|More true to form than the original version that starred Gene Wilder, Tim Burton's version gives us scenes that tbey were unable to do before. Such as the squirrils.<br /><br />A much more darker look at Willie Wonka though protrayed well by Johnny Depp, I didn't like it nearly as much. The first one was fun, this one seemed more along the lines of being disturbing. Aside from that minor detail, it was entertaining.<br /><br />In one scene when the Oompa Loompas, who are very disturbingly identical, begin what Willie Wonka calls a 'spontaneous musical number' one of the guests comments that it seems a bit too 'planned' to be spontaneous. Subtle humor like that is what kept me going.<br /><br />The whole time with his dad who was played by Christopher Lee, a giant in the pulp horror of the sixties and seventies, I felt didn't add much to the wonder of the movie. Rather, it gave more of an odd feel to it.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it. NOt as much as the original, but I did like it.

B000GCFO08|4.0|Everyone told me not to see this movie. Friends told me it was the worst movie ever made. I played the video games on Playstation though, and when I saw the previews I really wanted to see it. Unfortunately it was out of theatres before I could. I don't really understand why everyone hated it. Everyone has their own taste, but I happened to really enjoy this movie.<br /><br />The basic plot is a mother who goes to investigate a town called Silent Hill, after her daughter who suffers from sleep trauma keeps repeating it in her sleep. Soon mother and daughter find themselves in the strange town of Silent Hill, which is fairly desolate, and where creatures come out at night. She loses her daughter, and the movie essentially is her trying to find clues where she can find her daughter. Ultimtely though she ends up uncovering a mystery about this town.<br /><br />I found the acting to be nice, but the real treat was the direction and special effects in the movie. More than that, the plot was really interesting. It's a complicated movie, I'm still not sure if I totally get it. The good news for me is that I liked it enough, to watch it again and again until I truly figure it out.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I love this show! I love this DVD! Please release Seasons 2, 3, and 4 on DVD soon!!
B000002I25|5.0|First of all the idiot who said this is the most overrated album of the 60's is a complete fool. That is the worst review I have ever read.  <br />Ok, the album is just great. The Doors are not your ordinary rock band but what they do makes them that much better. There songs are different and Jim Morrison sings in his own unique style. This is an album that I can listen to over and over from beginning to end.  <br />The lyrics are just amazing. My least favorite song here is Alabama Song(which is a cover anyway), and I really don't like covers in general.  <br />This has to be one of the greatest debut albums of all time. If you want to get into The Doors this is a great start.

B00000JXVK|5.0|Before the glut of Chopper Shows on cable TV reduced the world of motorcycling to a pinhole of grouchy, sleeveless, bad-boy \\"Bikers\\" packing an attitude, there was a movie about true Motorcyclists. <br />Copyrighted in 1971, On Any Sunday explored a wide range of racing, recreational, and other just plain fun on motorcycles. <br />Bruce Brown teamed with Steve McQueen, and their love of motorcycles and film-making produced a movie of rare style, vision, and heart.  With music by Dominic Frontiere (who did Outer Limits and worked with The Tubes on their first album, among other projects), the film combined great camera work and production values with humor, excitement, and a special \\"X-Factor\\" that gives this film a special life of its own. <br />Fans of great film-making, motorcycles, and Steve McQueen will find this film one they never tire of watching. <br />A truly great film which will live on because it touches something deep inside the human spirit, Freedom, as embodied in the magical, mystical motorcycle.
B00000GAIW|5.0|This is one album that just hits the spot in every way. Jethro Tull is just an amazing band. This album contains some outstanding songs. Locamotive Breath in my opinion is one of the greatest songs ever written. Of course Aqualung is a classic but Cross-Eyed Mary, and Hymn 43 are great songs. All I can say is outstanding.
6305907145|1.0|This adaptation ... what am I saying?!, this film whose creators had the audacity to call it \\"Mansfield park\\" and say it was based on Jane Austen's novel is GHASTLY!<br /><br />First I was totally appalled, then horrified what they made of Austen's brilliantly plotted and well-characterized novel. It's not simply a charicature, it's grotesque and horrifying. Fanny Price became an inept, sniggering feminist, Lady Bertram an alcoholic and possibly a drug addict, Maria Bertram a fat, ugly trollop, Mary Crawford a lesbian, Mansfield Park a run-down shanty .... and I could go on and on.<br /><br />The whole plot is inconsequent, illogical and loose to say the least. Characters act and speak totally out of place for the time of Regency, there isn't one of them you could grow to like - all of them behave ghastly.<br /><br />People who haven't read Jane Austen yet, please, please, please do not think this is her!!! No way. The crew should be ashamed of themselves.
0316172324|4.0|There is just something about this book that holds it back from greatness...   <br /> <br />Gladwell writes well and presents his stories and illustrations admirably, but he bills this book to be an argument and it simply isn't structured to be a good one.  The most glaring shortcoming of the book lies in its failure to recognize the role of preparation in the conditioning of the subconscious.  He draws from examples of doctors, gamblers, and art historians to support his argument but fails to reflect the immeasurable effort and experience that positioned such experts to deduce and calculate in ways beyond appreciation. <br /> <br />Flaws aside, this remains a provocative read from a fascinating voice.  It does succeed in instilling or at least encouraging a sense of confidence in one's subconscious, and as such it will long remain a valuable (though potentially dangerous) book.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|this is a good CD overall, J. Mayer does well in his own type of style. The first 2 songs and Vulture are good ones, the rest kind of sound similar. But since I'm such a JM fan, I'd say its money well spent considering what else is out there.
B00005JKED|4.0|The first day of school, work, or any experience is usually a tense, vulnerable, and scary day. A new chapter and world to an extent is on the horizon and being ready is an utmost a necessity.<br /><br />Jake Hoyt starts his day with a nervous enthusiasm most would exhibit, but his day is about to take a hellish turn the wrong way. In his introduction to Alonzo, Hoyt immediately knows where he stands from a pupil to teacher perspective. Alonzo is a as \\"type A\\" as it gets and his rules/life are governed by a culmination of years steered towards the wrong path. Alonzo admittedly was like Hoyt; green and eager, but was led towards the faster and easier path to \\"success\\". His current situation (a little problem with some Russians in Vegas) was top priority and he would be very willing to use any resources surrounding him the remedy the problem.<br /><br />A key point surrounding Alonzo is that he never strayed from the actual truth (well at least until the end) spilling all the beans and harsh realities to the novice Hoyt. In one day Hoyt is taken to an unbelievable rollercoaster ride with the devil himself.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke plays very well in this role as the newbie Hoyt. He stays quite true throughout the story despite temptation and force. Denzel Washington's portrayal as Alonzo rightfully earned him top acting honors by the Academy. He risked quite a lot playing a character of Alonzo's nature. His choosing of this was odd for many of his fans and critics who are use to Washington playing the \\"good\\" character...as the heel he blows them all away.<br /><br />Truly acted very well by the leading and supporting cast.
1881273156|5.0|I have read/bought a lot of of self help/marriage books, but this is one that I truly believe changed our marriage.  We bought both books (this one and the one especially for husbands) and read through it together.  It really changed our relationship (for the better) and made us understand each other in a completely new light.  I give my HIGHEST recommendation for this book!!
B000H7JD4A|5.0|After (and including) Fear of the Dark, Iron Maiden went through something of a mid-life crisis. The Blaze Bayley era had precious few truly good songs (The Clansmen and Sign of the Cross come to mind), and the last two albums, especially the penultimate Dance of Death, while containing some undeniably great moments, showed the 'classic' line-up at their most ambivalent. Now, happily, Iron Maiden are in top form, releasing an album more grandiose than Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, melodically equal or even superior to their self-titled album, and with an incessantly motive heaviness--a heaviness only emphasised by the acutely and thoughtfully measured sound production.<br /><br />Each song, as with all great Maiden songs, becomes more enjoyable with repeated listenings. That cannonade of drum rolls that you missed, or that foregounding of Harris's galloping bassline, or a momentary harmony between the three guitars--whatever detail it may be, each song is masterfully layered.<br /><br />A previous reviewer made the comment that this could not be Iron Maiden's best or even one of their best albums, not because the music is inferior, but because of their age. Something as extrinsic as their age only has a bearing on the quality of the album if it adversely affects the music. In 'A Matter of Life and Death' it certainly does not; were I given all of Iron Maiden's albums blind, I would put this in the same era as Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Bruce Dickinson's voice is as strong as it ever was (though I do agree with yet another above reviewer that his voice could utilise the lower registers a bit more for some relief by contrast); the three guitarists are playing the best they've ever played; Harris's bass is perfectly integrated--and played. Special mention, however, must go to Nicko McBrain's drumwork: it is by far his best and most sophisticated yet.<br /><br />On previous albums, war has been a common theme--equally common has been its somewhat naive and belligerent depiction. In 'A Matter of Life and Death' the writing has matured, and a cynicism about war, a concern for its human effects, and the role that religion plays take salience. I would hesistate in calling it particularly new or sophisticated, but there is certainly here a noble message.<br /><br />Now I will give the obligatory track-by-track run-down:<br /><br />The opener, 'Different World', is the weakest track on the album--on almost any other album by almost any other band, however, it would almost certainly be a flagship. Fast, cannonading, and with a strong riff, it is a good, if rather standard, opener.<br /><br />The second track, 'These Colours Don't Run'--while being a reference to Sharon Osbourne's egg-attack on the band some years ago--starts with a classic Maiden build-up, from singular guitar melody to the simultaneous introduction of Bruce's operatic vocals and the rhythm section. While a good song, this is still rather pedestrian for Maiden.<br /><br />Number three is the already famous 'Brighter than a Thousand Suns', which purports to present the details of a nuclear detonation. The guitars and the back-up vocals are put to fantastic use here, especially the rhythm guitar. The images are vivid--unusually vivid for Iron Maiden, whose lyrics usually tip into self-parody (though precious few listen to Maiden for the quality of the lyrics).<br /><br />Next up is one of my favourites: 'The Pilgrim'. The drum and guitar dominant introduction is reminiscent of a Slavic dance--incredibly melodic and punctuated with powerful drum work. It is similar in tone to 'Mother Russia'. McBrain distinguishes himself here.<br /><br />As Harris does in the next track, 'The Longest Day', with a downplayed and galloping bass complementing, but not overbearing or being overborne by, a distant and resonant guitar. Bruce lets loose on the vocals here--soaring and, I'll say it again, melodic.<br /><br />The next track, 'Out of the Shadows', reminds me (perhaps unjustifiedly) of 'Strange World' from their self-titled release. Beautifully done.<br /><br />And then there's 'The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg'. None of the tracks so far I would call classic, but this one will last--and if it doesn't, it is an indictment of modern muscial taste rather than of the quality of the track. A long, melodious, and rather haunting opening; the lyrics are now foregrounded, as they are first and foremost telling a story rather than being subservient complements to a riff or grind; and then something extraordinary happens: the neck of one of the guitars is almost flayed of its strings as the song falls into its most heavy section. Bruce's vocals here are in a lower register (though still rather high, as they are wont to be), which is refreshing. Fantastic song, and one I cannot recomment highly enough.<br /><br />As is the next one--it is perhaps even superior, I can't quite decide. 'For the Greater Good of God' has a classic Harris opening--a full and emotive bassline. My review is becoming longwinded so I'll truncate it from here on. The song is (arguably) the most epic on the album, with some fantastic guitar work--the three men complement each other perfectly. Retaining Janick Gers was a great idea, it seems.<br /><br />The final two tracks, 'Lord of Light' and 'The Legacy' maintain the quality of the album so far--the latter imbibed with a deathly and unsettling tone; the former being a classicly elevated hard-rocker.<br /><br />Though some of the tracks are slightly overlong ('For the Greater Good of God' and 'The Legacy' could have a minute shaved off each) it is hardly to the detriment of the album. 'A Matter of Life and Death' is equal to Maiden's very best and, given time, may even supersede their 'Golden Years' efforts, rendering the former years quite silver and the following gold. How unusual it is for a band, after almost three decades, to release one of their best albums. It gives me hopes for Metallica's redemption--though not that much hope.perhaps unjustifiedly) of 'Strange World' from their self-titled release.

B000000OUJ|5.0|Go out and cop this album. you won't be let down, like most modern day releases. 4th chamber, shadowboxin are just a few of the highlights and many more. The lyrical swordplay is awesome and this cd is a true essence of hiphop. A must buy. <br />rating A+
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Three Days Grace had alot of expectations to meet with past hits \\"Just like you\\" \\"Home\\" and \\"Everything about you\\" and I must say this album by far past all expecations. They definately stayed true to themselves which is good because alot of bands will change the sound of their music because their lable forces them to sound a certain way. And Three Days Grace didn't change one bit. Everything rocks about this album, the only song that I wasn't crazy about was \\"Over and Over\\" it sounds a bit like a generic backstreet boys song haha but its still ok.
B00006JJ51|5.0|This cd was the definition of gansta rap (drug dealin, shooting, dealing with cops etc...). Every mc probaly had this cd when they were growing up and still have it to this day. Flat out, \\"straight outta compton\\" is a gangsta classic and the sound is raw and uncut. Definately a must have for rap fans. <br />rating A+
B000GFLKF8|3.0|The movie is engaging at times, but as far as a movie with a heist as a central theme is concerned, it falls way short. The movie has some social messages due to the fact that this is a Spike Lee movie but in essence the movie is very mediocre.
B00000K0T8|5.0|This is one hot album. Ghost is hungry on this cd and you can just hear it. Definately in the classic wu-albums. every song is solid, from iron maiden to motherless child a must own for any hiphop fan
B000G75AE8|2.0|When I read some of the reviews here saying that \\"this is Slayers best in 16 years\\" or \\"best metal album in 5 years\\" blah blah blah, I almost fell of my chair laughing............. <br /> <br />I've been a Slayer fan for 20 years and this new album is one of, if not the worst Slayer album yet....WHY?? <br /> <br />1. Riffs are bland, almost generic, recycled and uninteresting... <br /> <br />2. The lyrics are so silly that they are laughable and only someone with an IQ of under 80 could actually take them seriously. They have decided to jump back onboard the rehashed anti religious bandwagon which seems to be almost a sign of desperation to create some controversy and get publicity.  <br />(and surprise, surprise, only Christianity seems to get bagged on here, Gee I would have thought Islam and Judhism would have at least got a mention Mr. King??) <br /> <br />3. Hanneman and Kings solo's have gotten so bad and irritating that it's almost got to a stage where you almost wish they didn't even play them anymore. Hanneman's sounds like he just plays the same scale over and over again, and King? well, he just cant seem to get enough of his whammy bar and wah wah pedal. <br /> <br />4. The production is pretty weak <br /> <br />5. No memorable songs or riffs on the entire album <br /> <br />It is as clear as day that the once great Slayer have ran out of ideas musically and lyrically and are a shadow of their former selves. <br /> <br />Back in the day there weren't many bands that could hold a candle to Slayer but now, there are so many bands that literally blow them away in just about every department. <br /> <br />Slayer have become just another metal band and Christ Illusion gets old very fast. There are so few highlights on here that they aren't even worth mentioning. <br /> <br />I predict the people praising this album will get sick of it once the novelty has worn off and go back to listing to their classics, while Christ Illusion picks up dust and cobwebs in their cd library........(mine has already....) <br /> <br />5 years for this album???? puhlease! it sounds like something they could have slapped together in a few months. <br /> <br />verdict? .........poor effort <br /> <br />maybe hoping Slayer make another great record is just an \\"illusion\\" <br />
0316168815|4.0|This wasn't the suspenseful murder mystery I expected. Instead, I found so much more - a tale of how a person's unexpected death affects everyone around them. I love the first person narrative-- it really drew me in straight from the beginning. The book evoked so much emotion in me - I haven't cried while reading a book in a long time. The actions and reactions of Suzie's family members were very realistic. The characters were all relatable. The glipses into the afterlife were hopeful. I really enjoyed this.
0743454537|4.0|My Sister's Keeper is the story of a family torn apart by illness.  The Fitzgerald's second daughter, Kate, is diagnosed with leukemia at a young age.  The only hope for her is a genetic match to replace her sick tissue with healthy tissue.  None of the family is a match, so Sara and Brian conceive a child with an exact genetic match.  Kate's illness dominates the family - from missing holidays to an increasingly delinquent older son to Kate's savior, Anna, filing a lawsuit for medical emancipation. <br /> <br />This book evoked so many emotions at once; there are so many sides to the story and it is difficult to tell what is right and what is wrong.  Picoult's writing is flawless with such frank emotion.  But sometimes it was too flawless.  She takes a very complex, difficult, messy situation and ties it up in a neat little bow.  Example: in a paragraph about the father's interest in astronomy, the paragraph ends \\"The earth's axis wobbles.  Life isn't nearly as stable as we want it to be.\\"  ::sigh::  It's like there's a moral/something to take away from every single paragraph, which gets exhausting and seems a little condescending (like you might not get the point unless she explains it to you... using a teacher voice...).   <br /> <br />Two more complaints/warnings:  <br />1) Anna, the genetically engineered daughter seems waaayy to old for her age.  I understand that her situation may have made her more mature than other 13-year olds, but some of the comments she makes are just too old (i.e., thinking her lawyer, Campbell Alexander's name sounds like a WASPy mixed drink or seeing a mechanical contraption in her brother's room and realizing it's a still with which to make alcohol).   <br /> <br />2) As with others, I thought the ending was ridiculous deux-e-machina.  The ending would have been the same to me if Picoult had written that the sky opened up and rained Skittles.  Part of the beauty of the first 375 pages was the methodical nature in which the story unfolds.  Picoult takes her time laying out the details and the complexities of the story with skill.  Then, between pages 376 to the end, less than 75 pages, more events take place than during the whole rest of the book.   <br /> <br />But over 80% of the book was pretty darn good, so I still would recommend it to people, despite its flaws.
B000G759LW|1.0|I have endured (there is no other way to describe it) this album for the last four days in my workplace. My goodwill towards and open mind about the music of Ms Christina Aguilera have dried up.<br /><br />I hope I NEVER hear this sorry mess of an album again.<br /><br />Why am I writing these things? Well, I have a number of complaints about this product, and a \\"product\\" it is, for I could hardly suggest that I was overtaken by any impressions that the music on this compact disc was any sort of \\"manifesto\\" of ideas, philosophies, emotions, grand passions, yearnings or abstract and attractive musical structures. This CD is a unit - to be sold, and, hopefully, sell as many as possible.<br /><br />My first complaint is that this CD does not contain music which could be described as effective or successful \\"Pop\\", or Rock or Jazz or Latin or anything in particular. The songs tend to wander around aimlessly for a few minutes and then stop. Christina Aguilera's vocal style on this CD is rather one dimensional, lacking dynamics and \\"affected\\". Ms Aguilera's vocal affectations are further confused and made illogical by the overdubbing of her own voice into the songs in an apparently very ad hoc manner. The melodic lines are obscured, where they exist at all, by editing, and the vocalisations, which litter the songs, seriously detract from any sense of the contour, logic and rhetoric of the melodic line and the superstructure of each song. In fact, the songs all tend to sound very similar - this wouldn't be so bad if the model was excellent in the first place. However, the vision from the artist and her musicians and producers of what constitutes \\"a good song\\" on this album clearly seems to be a particularly confused and prosaic one. The most successful idea communicated most of the time is some sort of tedious \\"randy pretentiousness\\" - musical \\"soft-core porn\\" manqu&eacute;. I got the vague impression that Ms Aguilera is trying to display her libido on this disc and she does that in a very shallow, embarrassing and ultimately phoney way.<br /><br />I also feel that most of the material presented on this CD doesn't represent completed songs at all, rather, they are sketches or first drafts of songs - before a rigorous \\"weeding out\\" process, \\"tough decisions\\", intellectual discipline and some filtering would be normally applied to such material. What went onto the CD was messy, pretentious and poorly conceived, in my opinion. Was no one in the recording studio brave enough to humbly submit to Ms Aguilera that the songs could do with a little \\"tweaking\\" and rationalisation? One may suspect as much!<br /><br />Ms Aguilera's voice rarely, if ever, seems to venture further than a single octave on this disc. I don't mind a limited tessitura IF the singer has a beautiful voice and/or can deliver a song with great pizzazz, \\"moment\\", beauty, style, emotion or intelligence. Christina Aguilera's voice lacks light and shade and she does not do anything interesting with the various registers of her voice. She \\"sits\\" on her voice a lot and has a slightly nasal timbre and frequently \\"squeezed\\" quality that a good singing teacher would endeavour to correct. The voice is also mixed way too high in the recording for my tastes. Again, it does tend to lead one to the conclusion that Ms Aguilera may have wanted the instrumental aspects of her album to be a very distant second to her voice. If she had the voice of Chaka Khan or Aretha Franklin, I would be willing to excuse that, however! ....<br />Christina Aguilera seems to want to be some sort of \\"pop\\" coloratura soprano, I suppose. However, with daring, sexy, adventurous, intelligent, qualified, wild, wildly talented and beautiful singers like Patricia Petibon, V&eacute;ronique Gens, Rosemary Joshua, Carolyn Sampson, Mar&iacute;a Bayo and Sandrine Piau out there making CDs, the efforts of pop singers like Christina Aguilera sound rather dreary, third rate and amateurish.<br /><br />This album has clearlyhad a lot of money spent on it and its presentation, marketing. We see some very attractive photos of the singer on the cover. Yet, I cannot help but think that it would have been better if Ms Aguilera posed for the photographers and she let someone else be brought in to sing the songs (such as they are). Remember how Audrey Hepburn acted in My Fair Lady and someone else sang her character's songs? Well, perhaps Christine Aguilera should consider that strategy next time?<br /><br />Back to Basics is all show and no substance, filled with aimless sounding melodic lines. I am unmoved by the supposed beauty of this singer and her reputation. This is the first Christina Aguilera album I have heard in any thorough way and, until proof of improvement (vis-&agrave;-vis songwriting, vocal technique and lyrics) is presented to me, I hope it is the last.attractive photos of the singer on the cover.

B00005JMYI|2.0|My brother quoted a line out of Anchorman that immediately caused my wife to put it at the top of our Netflix list. We couldn't pass up the opportunity to see Steve Carrell screw up the news like he did in Bruce Almighty.<br /><br />Anchorman has a plot, but does anyone care?  It's mostly about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) playing a 70s overconfident anchorman whose macho buddy-verse consisting of Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), and Champ Kind (David Koechner) is disrupted by the promotion of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) into their news ranks.  Mostly.<br /><br />Anchorman is all over the place.  It pokes fun at news shows, like how they all hate each other like 50s gangs (and imagines them duking it out with bats in alleys).  It jokes about how the intelligence requirements to become a weatherman (Brick has an IQ of 48 and is \\"what some people call mentally retarded.\\") It mocks 70s fashion (Look at those shoes! That moustache! Those slacks!).  It painfully wrangles with the struggle of equality in the workplace.  Sometimes it's about the love between a man and a woman...and sometimes it's about the love between a man and his dog.<br /><br />Anchorman's a lot of things, not all of them funny.  In fact, Carrell is far funnier than Ferrell, and he has a lot less lines.  Ferrell infuses Burgundy with a vague accent that he drops in and out of.  He says all his lines like a kid play-acting in front of his high school class.  Being funny takes a lot of work, but it shouldn't look like it: Ferrell seems constipated for most of the movie.  That leaves poor Applegate to shoulder the burden, bless her heart...but she's the straightwoman, so there's not a lot she can do to help.<br /><br />It's hard to say a comedy is bad. Just about every movie can be funny, even unintentionally, and a judgment on quality humor is extremely subjective. I have to be honest, though: Anchorman feels lazy.  It doesn't really have a plot, the acting is terrible, and most of the jokes are beaten to brutal, bloody deaths.  I mean, jazz flute is funny and all, but after awhile you need to put the flute down and tell a joke or something.  The ending doesn't even make any sense (and it's clear, after watching what was cut, that they cut a major plot point).<br /><br />I love Carrell though.  His lines alone make the film worth watching.  And now that I've seen it...<br /><br />\\"I love lamp.\\"g is terrible, and most of the jokes are beaten to brutal, bloody deaths.

B000FDECGA|4.0|Without a doubt a genre classic, this compilation of the first and second episode of the Lone Wolf and Cub does it for me. The first reason is the all new digital transfer, bringing a new texture of picture and sound quality. Of course the english dubbing and sound effects are annoying, i'm myself an enemy of dubbing ANY kind of foreign title. But we can now see an enlarged widescreen edition, that shows a lot more in brightful colors and delicate \\"drawing\\" of the characters.  Because this is a compilation of 11 minutes of the sword of vengeance and 73 minutes of the river styxx, the english dubbing tells us a different story. In the original lone wolf series, the evil character with white beard is the leader of a ninja clan, but here he IS the shogun himself. This helps resuming the story and gives a more light continuity, but may be confusing to the lone wolf fans.  I hope they will be two more compilations of this kind to make some sense, but this movie made it by itself, more than a \\"best of\\".For some this movie can be a perfect resume, more watchable and even enjoyable than the original two first pictures.  Finally, if you think a 1972 samurai movie cannot possibly do it because of today's digital advances, you're up to a surprise. Of course all the bloodbaths semmed fake, but the CRUELTY, cold blooded carnage style will, at least, shock you. Nobody is worth be saved, even women and children. Lightning swords slicing and deadly baby carts for the ultimate ninja showdowns on epic films history.  See it for yourself, this edition is an opportunity, but in any case can replace the lone wolf series.A great start for the new fans of the genre.

B0000DZTIW|5.0|Hans Zimmer and The Last Samurai. Now To me a great movie soundtrack is something even those who hated the actual movie can love, and i did enjoy this movie though many did not. I believe Hans Zimmer is obviously one of the better known composers of our time. Some of his works are a hit and some are sadly a miss. But The last Samurai is without a doubt one of Han's best works to date. The first track alone, \\"A way of life\\" makes it worth buying this album. And yes some might call this entire score slow or boring, however i believe those who do have no appreciation of the beauty of what music can represent, this is truly Zimmer at his best. Now truthfully Howard Shore, with the LOTR soundtracks is the only composer, yes John Williams is damn good too, who might outshine Zimmer overall. But Shore, Zimmer, Williams, to me it is so hard to pick a favorite since they have all done brilliant and memorable scores. But the soundtrack to The Last Samurai is something true fans of beautiful music will want to own whether they liked the movie or not.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Congratulations should go out to the Director, Producer, cast and crew of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow... <br />In the genre of Sci-Fi/Fantasy there exists a pantheon of films that are so bold, stunning, and visionary they seem to defy immitation even though they inspire great envy.  Despite any possible deficits, I believe Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow will join the ranks of Bladerunner, The Dark Crystal,  Tron, and 2001:a Space Odyssey (as well as a few others).  I can think of no higher praise.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I've heard a lot of strange comparisons between this band and others (Nick Cave, Joy Division). I don't hear it. Maybe Mark Lanegan and American Music Club. I do hear a great band with with two excellent guitarists and a pretty good singer who hits a few flat notes here and there. The songs are good and memorable, especially \\"Friend of Mine\\" and \\"Karen\\". The lyrics are very interesting and unpredictable, but the work of the two guitarists who pluck interesting intertwined high notes more than they strum power chords is what really makes this band and this album great.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This album is great and everyone who is calling them zeppelin rip-offs is foolish. They haven't ripped off zeppelin, they are simply influenced by them and other great rock bands of the past. Led Zeppelin is my favorite band and I hate to say this but zeppelin ripped off many groups, they ripped dazed and confused straight from jake holmes and the main guitar part to stairway to heaven is ripped from a band called spirit, and they ripped off quite a few other bands, but does that mean there bad, no they were an incrediably innovative and talented band, the best ever. Wolfmother is a great group to maybe not the most innovative but their music is fun, and that's what rock and roll is supposed to be, and they are great live.    If you like wolfmother, then you should check out rose hill drive they also have a sound reminiscent to led zeppelin and they completely rock live, trust me check them out you won't regret it.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This is a great album.  Every song on the album displays how awesome the band is and how they can rock out.  This is the album I use to get pumped up and believe me it'll do it to you too.
B000H305U0|5.0|I bought this album with no preconceived notions. I doubted Justin with his first solo album and then ended up loving it, so I decided to take a 'just listen' approach with FS/LS. I was pretty much blown away. The production on this record is amazing. Timberlake and Timbaland have done it again. Also, the work JT and Rick Rubin did on \\"(Another Song) All Over Again\\" makes me hope they collaborate again in the near future. <br /> <br />Justin really took some chances musically on theis record. He didn't make Justified Part 2 and I love that. Hopefully some more Grammy's are coming Mr. Timberlake's way. He deserves them. <br /> <br />
B000GRTQSE|4.0|Dylan serves up another memorable musical feast. However, there isn't much that is modern here except the title.  Dylan samples from a broad range of music from honky tonk to late 70's folk music, reminding us as much about his past as those of others.  I'm sure everyone has heard about the Timrod lines, but Dylan also draws on traditional blues songs like \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" and late 70's folk songs like \\"Romeo's Tune,\\" by Steve Forbert, which underscores \\"Workingman Blues.\\"  The controversy isn't so much in the sampling, but rather that Bob didn't credit anyone except himself for the music and lyrics.  Some have gone so far as to suggest that \\"Modern Times\\" is an anagram for \\"Timrod semen,\\" but I think the title is more a wry wink at the contemporary music scene.<br /><br />The songs do sound fresh with a sterling band that gives the album the feel of a jam session, with Dylan's assertive voice firmly in control.  The album and DVD, which is little more than a promo disc, are nicely packaged in the style of an old album book like your parents used to have.  One only gets to see Bob jam on \\"Love Sick\\" and \\"Cold Irons Bound.\\"  I would have liked to see some liner notes in this little booklet, but all we are treated to are some Claxton photographs of a scowling Bob and the band.  Regardless of your feelings on the lack of credits in this recording, the music is rock solid and illustrates once again that Bob Dylan is a towering force in the music industry.
1400044162|5.0|I have just finished reading Half of a Yellow Sun, the second novel by highly-acclaimed young Nigerian writer, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I have to agree with critics that with this novel, Adichie has confirmed, if need be that, that she is one of the best writers of her generation, and that she is indeed \\"the 21st-century daughter of Chinua Achebe,\\"  as the Washington Post enthused in a review of her debut novel Purple Hibiscus.    Set in Nigeria before and during the secession of Biafra, Half of a Yellow Sun revolves around five very different characters; Thirteen-year old Ugwu, the fiercely loyal houseboy to Odenigbo, a revolutionary professor at the University of Nsukka and an unapologetic Biafran nationalist; the compassionate and sensitive Olanna, daughter of a wealthy Igbo businessman, who abandons the nouveau-riche lifestyle of post-independence Lagos for a more sedate, intellectual and passionate life in Nsukka with her lover Odenigbo; Richard, a pro-Biafran British idealist who has a passion for Igbo traditional art and is in love with Olanna's twin sister, the placid, distant and enigmatic Kainene.     The lives of these characters is masterfully woven into the events of that tumultuous decade in Nigeria's history which was marked by the first military coups in the country's history, the anti-Igbo pogroms in Northern Nigeria, the Biafran secession, and the ensuing civil war.    Although the Biafran secession and civil war serve as a backdrop to the novel, Half of a Yellow Sun is not a history of those events. Neither is it a classic war novel. Although the Biafran story is ever-present in the novel, it does not intrude, distort, or overwhelm the central story. Even when the characters are caught in the maelstrom of war, it is still their individual stories that are at the forefront. This is a story of love, betrayal, infidelity, forgiveness, hope, loss, grief, survival, resilience and broken dreams.    As we get to know the principal characters, we cannotstop ourselves from bonding with them - even in their most flawed moments - and wistfully hoping that their dreams would come true. Alas! This is fiction which solidly anchored in history - immutable history. So we know how the outcome of the civil war; the Land of the Rising Sun shall never come to be; the half of the yellow sun (emblem on the Biafran flag) will never grow full-blown, but will wither under the unrelenting attack of federal forces. Nonetheless, we hungrily read on because we desperately want to know whether our protagonists make it out of the war unscathed, and whether their relationships survive the war.     With Half of a Yellow Sun, Adichie has delivered a compelling book on love and war, on family and friendship, and on ethnicity and national identity. In this regard, the Los Angeles Times review is right on the mark when it observes that:     \\"...with searching insight, compassion and an unexpected yet utterly appropriate touch of wit, Adichie has created an extraordinary book, a worthy addition to the world's great tradition of large-visioned, powerfully realistic novels.\\"    Adichie's vibrant and fresh, brash and unfettered style reminds me of Wole Soyinka, although she is always compared to the more conservative Achebe. Either way, Adichie is a writer in her own right who is already blazing a unique trail for herself on the Nigerian, African and world literary scene.    Adichie is one of the few emerging African writers who have the potential to be universally recognized as a great novelist and not just an \\"African writer\\" (with the literary Ghettoization that this term invariably entails in some parts of the world).    Dibussi Tande [...]
020530902X|5.0|This little book is important reading for any one who has or is desiring to write. One of the best things that I could say about the book is that it is full of examples that are juxtaposed. Every element is clearly defined in such a way that any one can easily see the difference between the examples given. This book is a \\"how to\\" book for proper use of english in written form. It seemingly covers everything you could imagine from the use of commas and omiting needless words to expressing yourself clearly and not overwriting. The five chapters are: 1. Elementary Rules of Usage 2. Elementary Principles of Composition 3. A Few Matters of Form 4. Words and Expressions Commonly Misused 5. An Approach to Style.<br /><br />First written in 1919 and then added to in 1957, it has clearly withstood the test of time. After reading it I could see why. There is not a wasted sentence in the whole book. The 85 pages make it a very quick read.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I rememeber the first time that I listened to this CD.  I was in my car about a year ago waiting for an appointment.  I would hear a new song, and I would scream with the excitement of a teenage fangirl.  I love the arrangements of old standards. I love the new songs. I love the sound of the band, and most of all I love the sensuous sound of Michale Buble's voice. 10 out of 10!
B000008LOU|2.0|There was a reason why this was the last Wilburys album, it lacked the charm, spontaneity, great voice of Roy Orbison, and good songwriting of the first. They purposely set out to write non-serious music and what resulted was a mess. There is nothing on this album anywhere as good as Handle With Care, by far the best Wilburys song and for some reason George Harrison takes a back seat and turns over the reigns to Dylan & Petty and it was a mistake. Harrison was my favourite Wilbury and his voice is sadly missing from this album.    The album opens with the horrid She's My Baby. It has Jeff Lynne's handprints all over it. It is way over-produced, too ELO sounding and even Moore's guitar work can't save it. The single flopped for good reason. It is terrible and sounds so dated now and even then. Inside Out is better and it has the wonderful Harrison bridge, but the chorus is bit repetitive.    The best songs on this album are Where Were You Last Night, New Blue Moon and The Devil's Been Busy, but none of these songs are as good as most of Vol 1.    The worst are Cool Dry Place - a average Petty number, Wilbury Twist -  the contrived attempt to be funny that loses appeal quickly, & the previously mentioned She's My Baby.    Roy Orbison was sorely missed here. He had the best voice in the group and he added a dimension that they just couldn't replace. But despite his absence, they still had great talent in the group and delivered a set of forgetable songs. If these guys put a little effort into writing some decent music, instead of trying to be non-serious, then this could have been a much better album. It is nowhere as good as Vol 1 and most people agreed and lost interest in the group, especially when the singles were much weaker than Handle With Care & End of the Line.     I liked this album when it first came out, but like a lot of albums when the newness wears out it just collects dust on the shelf.     Save your money and wait for the reissue which will have some outtakes. Or buy Vol 1, the much better of the 2 albums.
B00005JOYM|4.0|I like to keep my reviews short and sweet. I took my 9 year old and 6 year old to see this. Irresponsible parenting? Not really. They were both enraptured to see if the Port Authority officers were going to get saved, and they both had lots of questions afterward.Neither seemed traumatized afterwards, or had bad dreams, or got scared.Such an important event in our nations history is not lost with the next generation, because this movie makes it interesting for kids too. This movie is very balanced I thought. It showed the enormity of the situation while also giving a personal view. I recommend it.
B000002L9J|5.0|While I have no trouble classifying this album as the perfect 80's album, I also cannot stress enough the importance \\"The Queen is Dead\\" carries with it even now. In terms of instrumentation or complexity, this album may not stand up to some others, but in terms of social importance, this collection of songs is equaled by few, if any, from the last century (think Revolver, Nevermind, Doolittle, etc.).  <br /> <br />The message conveyed in Morrissey's lyrics is difficult to put down in words, but it makes sense in the mind of any teenager who hears \\"There is a Light That Never Goes Out\\" for the first time and knows the emotionally disturbing feeling of wanting to escape home and less literally, all of lifes problems, or identifies with the angst in Morrissey's voice when he sings \\"Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head\\" at the end of \\"I Know Its Over.\\" While the album is obviously not only appreciated by young adults, the message, for obvious reasons, probably resonates more with the youth of our society. <br /> <br />The genius of this album is that it somehow manages to match the message perfectly with the music. The music isn't overpoweringly sad or creepy, but rather strangely pleasant and upbeat, and often noticably tongue-in-cheek. For this type of subject matter, it almost has to be. For example, \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" begins with a frantic guitar tune that immediately pulls the listener into Morrissey's world as he desperately tries to take back his Freudian slips, claiming he feels shameful and comparing himself ironically to Joan of Arc, who of course, felt no true remorse for her actions. \\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly\\" rejects the average and societal norm in exchange for the lifestyle of the musician; the melody is a jaunty beat that sets the tone perfectly and compliments Morrissey's triumphant voice as he proclaims \\"I want to live and I want to love, I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of.\\" <br /> <br />Morrissey's voice is just theicing on the cake. It adds the extra punch that so many other albums are sorely lacking. A perfect example is found on \\"There is a Light That Never Goes Out,\\" where he pleads \\"Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care...\\" with the quavering voice that captures the deep emotional state of many troubled youth in just a few bars. Morrissey has something important to say on this album, and he'll get you to feel it any way he knows how, even if it means destroying your understanding in order to rebuild it.  <br /> <br />Every single song on this album can be dissected and analyzed on its own. It's not a depressing album; moreso it's an album about facing your demons and dealing with the emotional uncertainty of youth. Death is an important theme of this album, but so is hope,  as is acceptance, as jokingly pointed out in the final song, \\"Some Girls are Bigger than Others.\\"  <br /> <br />If you're ready for one of the most emotionally deep and socially poignant albums of the last few decades, buy this album.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|X-Men has delivered the first time, then again, and again!  This time out they push the envelope even further, and keep you glued to your seat watching enthusiastically wondering what is going to happen next!  I loved the previous 2 X-Men movies, and bought them up quick.  I guarantee I will be buying the third for my collection as well.  The effects are top-notch, and this movie was full of emotions.  It had action, intrigue, sorrow, romance, suspense, everything a moviegoer could want.  I won't ruin the ending for you, but can say that a few important questions get answered in this movie, and it is very powerful all the way to the end.  If you are a comic book fan or an action movie fan, buying this movie is a no-brainer.  Enjoy!
B00005JP81|5.0|For several years now I have been waiting for Ryan Gosling to fulfill the promise that he exhibited in his revolutionary performance in \\"The Believer.\\" Films have come and gone and in most of them he has been giving good performances (\\"Murder by Numbers\\") and problematic ones (\\"The Notebook\\") but always with a sense of who he is as an actor and more importantly how he can use his talent and his very being to bring the story of the character he is playing alive.<br />Now with his Dan Dunne, Gosling has finally fulfilled that promise and his Dunne is complicated (a terrific, human, enabling and encouraging high school teacher who is also a cocaine free-baser), sensitive to a fault, sexually aware...basically a talented, educated, addicted man from a loving family that can't help but fall victim to the baser parts of his nature. He is upright, strong, smart, loving but can't help but call on the appeal of drugs to douse the raging fire of indecision and self-hatred burning deep inside of him. A fire that director/writers Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden choose not to explicitly reveal, though after a Dunne family dinner we are perhaps given some hints into Dan Dunne's upbringing and politically committed family and therefore the genesis of his addiction.<br />Fleck and Boden give us expositional information in a very interesting way here particularly the juxtaposition, the flipping back and forth of the images between the Dunne family dinner (ex-hippie parents, socially and politically committed brother and his girlfriend... eating, drinking bottles and bottles of wine) and Dunne's student and friend Drey's evening home with family: filling small plastic bags with cocaine, chatting about her brother in jail...all polite and ordinary. But honestly: which family situation is best, which family situation is the most comforting for Dan and Drey. This masterful scene goes on for quite a long time and yet Fleck and Boden refuse to comment, refuse to put one family in a better light than the other.<br />Besides Gosling, there are a couple of actresses here that deserve special note. One, in a small role, though she appeared in both \\"Six Feet Under\\" and \\"Taken,\\" Tina Holmes as Goslings ex and a former addict's very presence on the screen brings a certain weight and gravity to this film and of course to her role. Holmes is all sly, shy smiles, small gestures (she does more with an eye crinkle than do most with long involved scenes) and an inherent honesty and vulnerability that makes your heart hurt. She actually steals her very first scene with Gosling by under acting and the sheer luminosity of her performance.<br />Secondly, Shareeka Epps as Drey is amazing: she has an old soul, and like Holmes a gravity and a basic honesty that sets her apart from others in her family and the other students in this film. As her jailed brothers friend Frank (the excellent Anthony Mackie) says of Drey's friendship with Dunne: \\"It is inappropriate.\\" But you know what, as presented and implemented in this film...it isn't. It's strange, it's rife with possible problems, it's audacious for sure but it's also the life preserver that saves both Dunne and Drey... it's their redemption.e other.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|This is a brilliant album: wonderful songs, beautifully executed. This can't be said for all Dylan albums. <br /> <br />It's easy to overlook, 42 years later, how original this material was when it came out. It was in the months leading up to this album's creation that the Beatles motivated Dylan to move on from his acoustic-folk music, and he motivated the Beatles to move on from their \\"Twist and Shout\\" type crap. They moved on to \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and became a brilliant studio-only band, and Dylan moved on to \\"Highway 61\\" and \\"Blond on Blonde\\" and became an icon. It can be said that this album marked the beginning of modern rock music.  <br /> <br />\\"She Belongs to Me\\" and \\"Love Minus Zero\\" are wonderful love songs; \\"On the Road Again\\" and \\"Dylan's 115th Dream\\" are hilarious satires; and \\"Gates of Eden\\" and \\"It's alright Ma\\" are dark, deep cynical masterpieces. How could a 23 year-old put all this together on one album? <br /> <br />People who have been introduced to Dylan by \\"Time out of Mind\\" and later material have no idea what a voice he used to have. It has never sounded as good as it does here, especially \\"It's all Over Now, Baby Blue\\". I will never get tired of this song.  <br /> <br />I have a big part of Dylans output and I think this CD showcases his voice and his songwriting best. \\"Highway 61\\" has a kind of garage-band sound that you have to be in the mood for, and \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" has a bit of filler, but \\"Bringing it all Back Home\\" has no weaknesses. <br /> <br />Critics have been trying to interpret the songs on this album for over 40 years now, especially \\"It's all Right Ma\\" and \\"Gates of Eden\\", attaching huge significance to words that Dylan himself chose simply because they rhymed. He wasn't trying to change the world; he was just trying to write songs people would enjoy.  <br /> <br />So get this CD and enjoy it - there isn't a weak song on it. Make sure you get the digitally re-mastered version, released in '03 - the sound is much better than on the older analog CD (ADD vs AAD). Look for the date on the back.
0684824906|5.0|A Wonderful book.  Well worth the trouble to read.  You will not be dissapointed.  Reserch is outstanding.
0743454537|4.0|I finished this book in a matter of days, and after being very disappointed with Plain Truth (to the point where I couldn't read more than a few chapters), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've got into Jodi Picoult (what if her last name was \\"onion\\"?) since taking some of her books on holiday with me, and have since been reading some of her others, although not spending a bloody fortune on them, as some of them have been pretty blah.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is one of those books you pick up numerous times, but never end up getting it. I wouldn't like to think how many times I've had to reach up to the top shelf of my local bookstore (and I'm short, so it's a struggle) to see if the price has changed. I've finally got it, and really enjoyed it. The book is about a girl who's basically born in order to save her sister, who's seriously ill. Like most of her books, and unlike Plain Truth, each chapter is dedicated to a different character in the book, and you get deeper into their story, and it's remarkably easy to switch back & forth. Anna, the main character, goes to a lawyer and goes through a court case (a standard of Jodi Picoult books) to get medically emancipated from her parents, so they can no longer use her bone marrow etc to save her sister. It's a very emotional journey throughout the book, and you're always switching between sides, as to which character you support.<br /><br />The lead up to the ending is quite literally a page turner. I hated having to stop because I had to go back to work, or because someone interrupted me. You're not expecting the sting in the tale, the twist in the end, and I literally sat still for 10 minutes after finishing it. Wow. I've had a little complaint about Jodi Picoult books in the past that they a) are all about court cases and b) their endings are always quite unsatisfactory. My Sister's Keeper is definitely not one of those, and I was quite teary by the end. The perfect situation where you need a hug, and there's no one there to hug.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is a must read over Plain Truth. I just didn't get that one. If you're going to buy any Jodi Picoult book, buy this one. You won't regret it.s no one there to hug. <br /> <br />My Sister's Keeper is a must read over Plain Truth. I just didn't get that one.

1401302378|5.0|Long Tail is about the economics of abundance, a relatively new phenomenon in our society. While the power law distribution (80-20 rule, Pareto distribution) is not new, the context of it in our society is; Chris Anderson does an exceptional job of articulating the impact of the Long Tail economics on our everyday life.<br /><br />As argued by the author, the PC democratized the tools of production be giving everyone cheap access to an unlimited toolbox. The Internet, in turn, democratized the means of distribution by giving the user (manufacturer) the ability to also be a world-wide distributor. Thus, we entered the era of information abundance; the Internet exploded and the information highways are packed as never before.  And this is where the third force comes in, filters! Filters are the tools we use to cut through the noise (read abundance) and find what is relevant to us. This is the reason for the success of Google, Ebay, Amazon, Netflix, Rhapsody... the list goes on.<br /><br />The differences between our culture 20 years ago, which utilized pre-filters (executives, designers, engineers, etc.) to define taste, and post-filters (bloggers, aggregators, recommendations, etc.) today have vastly changed the landscape of business and consumer behavior.  It may not be an 'industrial revolution', but it is changing the landscape of our society. Bloggers, 'virtual water cooler communities' and social bookmarking sites are all part of this undeniable trend.<br /><br />This is a book for everyone - entrepreneurs, marketing specialists, psychologists... and engineers. Chris Anderson provides a great overview of where were heading; all of the sudden all the latest trends seem to fit!
B000AYELVA|5.0|When this movie first came out, it was like \\"FINALLY!  X-Men on the big screen!\\"  Had they attempted to pull it off when X-Men was first invented in the early 60's, it would have fallen short, but modern special effects and filming techniques complemented the movie nicely.  And Wolverine, one of the most popular and awesome superheroes of all time, gets played by someone PERFECT for the role... Hugh Jackman!  Come to think of it, I have no complaints regarding the entire cast selection.  If you like superheroes and action movies, you owe it to yourself to watch X-Men.  And bonus, they made a sequel, and a third for us to enjoy!  I can't wait to watch it again...
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Usually when artists change there style it's usually worse, but John's latest is his best yet.  I haven't stopped playing this CD since it came out on Sept.12 (which is also my birthday, what a treat!!).  I actually pre-ordered it, but I saw it in the mall andI had to get it.  The only thing that disappoints me is that it'll be another year or two before we see another album from John Mayer.
B000002UTY|1.0|Damn nice cover art. After that it goes down hill.I guess you had to be there ? Long periods of absolutely nothing as in no sound! I actualy fell asleep the first time I listened to it ! Maybe if I got stoned before I listened to it , it would have been just like being in the audience in the old days .
B000BNX3B4|4.0|Well, if you are looking for Pride and Prejudice, this is definitely a 1.  If, however, you are looking for a cute, romantic love story that's not inappropriate for family like so many, this is a must see.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|A. I love the fact that this was finally released. Sure, it's the transfer from the 93 laser disc edition or something like that. Whatever. This is how it should be. A little dirty, sound like crap and nothing more. It's nostalgic. Han shoots first, No Han telling Jabba he's a wonderful \\"human being\\". This one thing that urks me though is yeah, you had to buy yet another copy of the 2004 really special edition. The other thing, and this may be just a nitpit, is an extra on Disc 2, the demo for Lego Star Wars 2. Now, why do you include a demo with the DVD, and release the DVD the same day as said game. That just made no sense. Waisted disc space that could have been used for say... the original \\"making of\\" documentaries, or perhaps the dredded Holiday Special. Atleast that would have made sense. Maybe good ole George forgot about that stuff. But still, it's worth it to me anyway.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X-Men fans, comic book fans, action movie fans, and all-around good movie fans, SEE THIS MOVIE!  The first movie set the bar high, but this movie tops it.  Right from the beginning you know you are in for a real treat.  I was spellbound the first time I watched it, and have watched it again and again since.  This is a title that is worth owning, as are the other 2 X-Men movies (both 1 and 3).  Once again Hugh Jackman pulls off playing Wolverine impeccably, and the other characters deliver too.  If you are a comic book fan or an action movie fan, getting the X-Men trilogy is a no-brainer.  Enjoy!
B000092Q4U|4.0|What the hell is up with dude like this Brian R, A-hole who write that the Lamb are posers, man if you listen to Brittney Spears we dont expect you to appreciate the power and sheer brutality that is LoG so go back to watchin Mtv little boy and leave real metal to the Men. Now back to the review, this Cd is heavy, excellent riffs, drumming is incredibly, still not their best, listening to Ashes and Sacrament you hear maturity in the lyrics, song structures, riffs, etc, signs of greatness?, definetly. Now dont judge Sacrament by Redneck alone, sure its a bit more comercial but the rest of the album is brutal, reminds me of this album in a sense that its a bit darker and more groove oriented. highlights here include Ruin, with the drum break right in the middle urrrgghhh!!!!, 11th hour whata riff, Vigil starts of very pretty then grabs you by the balls, etc... Get this album, its a good starting point for any metal fan.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Despite all the violence, at its core, Kill Bill 2 is a love story. The Bride, played by Uma Thurman, is physically tortured during certain scenes in this movie. However, the emotional distress she experiences concerning her feelings for Bill is extraordinary. It is obvious she is deeply conflicted and confused. It is also apparent that The Bride and Bill share a deep bond despite attempts to kill each other. This is especially evident during her the last scene involving The Bride and Bill. This movie comes highly recommended.

B00005ONMJ|5.0|I was sceptical about buying this DVD at first because of reading reviews saying the sound was 1950's Mono, the colors were washed out, etc.  But don't let that dissuade you from buying this copy because those \\"problems\\" hardly detract from the performance. <br /> <br />If you've seen any other productions of the opera (such as that of Mutti with La Scala) you know that some of them can be static and cookie cutterish. -- That isn't to say they're no good, but this production has, at the risk of sounding cliche, something magical to it. <br /> <br />Yes the Commendatore uses a bit too much vibrato and the \\"la ci darem la mano\\" is sung a bit slower than you're used to hearing (the best rendition of the scene being performed by Raimondi) but the opera is as near perfect as possible <br /> <br />Cesare Siepi's voice is unbelievable throughout and, not to mention, Otto Edelmann's opening scene (\\"Notte e Giorno Faticar\\") is absolutely perfect.  His tone is amazing.

B000H305U0|4.0|I got this album because I liked Justified, and I gotta say JT outdid his first album, which was probably his goal. This album kinda reminds me of Kanye West's Late Registration because it tries alot of different sounds, stretches the limit production wise, and switches the beat alot. JT produced almost all of the album with Timbaland and some guy named Nate \\" Danja \\" Hills. Some of the songs are kind of long but those who are really into music will appreciate it because Timbaland really stretches the songs for all they are worth. Love Stoned starts off as a funky party song and turns into one of those sentimental rock songs that are popular now a days. Chop Me Up changes the beat to a hard thumping beat that sounds like Three 6 Mafia produced it. The best song on the album to me is Until the End of Time. When I first heard the title I thought it was going to be a cheesy Michael Jackson rip-off(many think JT himself is a cheesy MJ rip-off) but it turned out to be a straight-up R&B song with no pop or hip-hop fluff. Overall JT still has a few corny lyrics and a helium, just got kicked in the balls, downright girly falsetto but this album is a step in the right direction for people to see him as a true artist and not just a bubble-gum boy bander. <br /> <br />1.

B00005JNX0|5.0|I've been wondering how to let Dreamworks know how much I have enjoyed watching Madagascar. My grandson and I have watched it at least a hundred times and, seriously, I never tire of it. There's something new I catch every time. We've made a game of learning the names of ALL the characters. This movie is so cleverly done, I smile just at the thought. It is downright amusing. I can't thank the makers enough for my countless hours of enjoyment. p.s. How clever were you to use the name of the town in Madagascar on the beach at \\"San Diego!\\"
B000GFLEX6|5.0|\\"Is this a dream, or is it real life?\\" What a wonderfully put together disc. You already know the songs and with the exception of the extended ending on \\"No Way\\" they haven't changed. After all, you can't improve on perfection. 28 years later and this record can still enthrall me. <br /> <br />But the real joy is not having to see if that familiar pop on \\"Mihalis\\" is going to skip this time. And not having to strain to really hear Wills and Wilson. I always knew there was a great rhythm section on this disc and now they come through loud and clear.  <br /> <br />Solo albums, especially those from members of largely popular bands, have a history of being disappointments. This disc is the antithesis to that. To hear the parts of Pink Floyd that David makes up vocally and musically as well as his own styles, makes this record a perfect representation of the Fender bender. I bow before Mr. Gilmour yet again. <br />
B000G8NXYQ|5.0|Fellini's Amarcord always ranks among the best 100 films in any critic's list, and rightfully. It is middle of the way between his realistic films and his most symbolic ones, that is why I think it can be available for all audiences. It's a beautiful color film.<br /><br />The most important thing to say about Amarcord is that it is funny, in a mild way, not critical, not hateful, just detached.<br /><br />It's characters are re-created after Fellini's cartoons, or stereotypes (some based on real characters in Rimini), some comlpetely imaginary, all most funny and entertaining.<br /><br />Exceptional package by Criterion.<br />Recommended as an exceptional example of the best European cinema.
0307346609|5.0|It shows that Brooks put a lot of thought into World War Z.  LaMOEs, zombie holes, quislings, Phalanx profiteers,Yonkers... don't read this book unless you wanna get pumped up.
B00008S2VG|3.0|While some reviewers feel the lyics may be weak, I feel they are pretty darn strong.  In fact, I have never had a problem with Madonna lyrics.  I will bet that if the lyrics were read without knowing who wrote them, the opinions would be different.  The problem with this album is the music that encases the lyrics.  I can't put my finger on it but it's missing something.  Possibly an extra beat or melody.  Bottom line, it's bland...very bland.  There is so much potential here and it was completely missed.  With regards to the vocal effort, it seems as though she was uninterested when she sang it.  This album is kinda of flat all around.
B00006I53S|5.0|This is a great general purpose lens.  The zoom range is almost perfect for everyday shots (wish it starts at 18 mm).  IS works great as other reviewers have already pointed out.  Instead of repeating what other reviewers have already written, I want to point out that IS will compensate for camera shake due to hand movement, but not movement of the subjects in your picture.  So if you are taking pictures of people (or other moving objects) with the lens zoomed out in low light, it's highly recommended you use a flash so the shutter speed stays reasonable.  This worked for me taking pictures from >100 ft away, full 135 mm zoom, with an 580EX flash on my digital rebel XT, and the pictures of the people I took came out quite sharp.  So the conclusion is that IS is good, but you should still have a good flash in your kit for best all around performance.
B000H305U0|5.0|Justin Timberlake is a rarity in today's music scene. Not content to rest on his laurels with a self-congratulatory pat on the back, he strives to challenge himself whenever possible. With the critical and popular success that he had with his first album, it would have been very easy for him to recycle those same ideas and rush out another album while he was on a hot streak. Instead, he took time away from the spotlight and came back fresh, with exciting new ideas and with a voice that has grown in flexibility and emotional strength. An honest-to-god album that's meant to be listened to from start to finish (instead of seemingly unrelated singles placed haphazardly on the disc), it's an invitation to take a musical journey for an hour or so. <br /> <br />This album has a little bit of something for everyone. The first half is dominated by killer beats and cool grooves, sure to make you dance in your seat, while the second half gives way to more laid-back, funkier, mellow tracks. The album starts off strong with the title track, \\"FutureSex/LoveSound\\", which sets the tone nicely for the journey the listener is about to take. And it ends on an even stronger note, with the superb \\"(Another Song) All Over Again\\", which truly showcases Mr. Timberlake's beautiful vocals, stripping away everything but the soul of the song. Done in a single vocal cut, it truly leaves the listener anxious to hear more of what Justin Timberlake has up his sleeve.
014118213X|2.0|I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it.
B0002NRRAG|3.0|Madeleine Peyroux has a great voice and terrific taste in songs to cover, and the band backing her up here hits all the right mellow, jazzy notes.  If she keeps up the effort, she's bound to produce some classic recordings.  But she isn't quite there yet.  There's nothing really wrong with these twelve songs - certainly nothing jumps out as poorly done.  The problem is more that nothing really jumps out, period.  Hearing their songs so tastefully copied makes me want to listen to Bessie Smith, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Hank Williams, but Peyroux doesn't make much of a case as to why we should listen to her versions instead of the originals.  Not bad at all, but only not bad.
B000GYI32M|1.0|The show started off really good and had a lot of potential, but it keeps getting worse. First the story line is pretty predictable and some of the characters are annoying. Don't waste your money, try another teen drama like One Tree Hill or Veronica Mars.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I remember buying this DVD in early 2002. It seemed to take forever to be releaed and when it was there was something wrong with the audio (I think) which meant it had to be returned and wait for the remastered version to come out. I remember thinking at the time Mike Portnoy handled all this very well, very up front about what had happened, plenty of information on the web site etc. The wait was well worth it though. Over 2 and a half hours of great material plus the audio commentary, documentary and some great photos. Also we get to see the amazing Jordan Rudess on keyboards - with hair!    For me \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" is Dream Theater's equivalent of Rush's \\"Exit Stage Left\\" (1981). It is a the band at their most confident with an album (\\"Scenes\\") which like Rush (\\"Moving Pictures\\") they were just so proud of. The confidence shown on both these bands DVD's is just so high - at the top of their game.    The sound is in PCM Stereo (there no 5.1 or DTS option) and for me it sounds fantastic.      James LaBrie gives a great performance on vocals (have to admit though his best live vocal performance is on \\"Score\\" (2006). John Petrucci is stunning on guitar (it's a close call between his performance here and that displayed on the stunning riffamania shown on \\"Live @ Budokhan\\" (2004). John Myung is awesome on Bass (as he always is - also check out his work on Score, stunning). Jordan Rudess really shines on this set, he really is in full flite. (His performance on \\"Budokhan\\" is also top notch and on \\"Score\\", well let's just say I'd say the Orchestra would have appreciated his keyboard work, it's is almost unearthly - the \\"Rick Wakeman / Keith Emerson\\" of current times, unbelievably good. And last but not least, Mike Portnoy who gives a fantastically energetic performance on drums. This was actually a 3 hour show (more material can be found on the on the corresponding 3 disc CD set including \\"Metropolis I\\" and \\"Another Day\\" from \\"Images and Words\\" (1992) and \\"The Mirror\\" From Awake (1994), and Mike never lets up. Along with Chester Thompson (Genesis) and Neil Peart (Rush) Mike is in my top three drummers and his display here is awesome. (Also check out \\"The test that stumped them all\\" on \\"Budokhan\\" or \\"Score\\" - awesome performance).     Whilst a reduced track listing compared to the CD set, as with Rush's Exit Stage left there is heaps of material to chose from and it's all top notch. We get the whole of \\"Scenes from a memory\\" complete with Choir for the \\"Sprit carries on\\" section (this section is totally over the top, exceeded all my expectations - fantastic job) plus the whole of \\"A mind besides itself\\" (\\"Erotomania / Voices / Silent Man\\") from \\"Awake\\" (1994), \\"Learning to live\\" from Images and Words (1992) and the whole of \\"Change of Seasons\\" from 1995.     It's really a great show, one of those that you can just feel and see the confidence oozing out of every note / beat / riff.   I can't speak highly enough of this show. If you do decide to get this one I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. 10 out of 10.
B00000JPYD|5.0|This is Trower's greatest work and one of the most powerful records in rock history.  I've played it over and over for thirty years and it sounds just as fresh as ever today.  Moody, powerful, expertly-played rock supported by some of the greatest vocals (Jim Dewar, R.I.P) ever recorded.  Just as intense in the slower moments (Bridge of Sighs, About to Begin) as in the sledgehammer guitar attacks (Day of the Eagle, Lady Love), Trower displays utter mastery and control over his effects-laden instrument while unleashing a stunning set of songs.  The album's  legendary status is cemented by the centerpiece \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\", the quintessential Trower tune: muscular rock, killer hooks and gritty vocals in the main section followed by the jaw-dropping epic guitar workout (over a driving one-note bass figure) that leaves this listener shaking and the audience whooping.  The comparisons to Hendrix are common; this is probably because no guitar player other than Hendrix ever made a noise as big and expressive as what can be heard here.  If you are a fan of hard rock with depth and power, Bridge of Sighs has to be a cornerstone of your collection and should resonate in your soul forever.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|If you've only seen \\"Love Actually\\" once or twice, you really haven't seen it - at least not all of it.  Probably no movie is more worthy of repeated viewings.  It's not that there's much of anything subtle about this saccharine but great collection of love stories.  Far from it.  It's just that there are so many stories being told at one time that keeping them all straight is tricky the first couple of times you see them unfold.   <br /> <br />So is keeping track of all the major characters - there are nearly twenty of them - but you do get to know them all surprisingly well after a few viewings.  Some are better developed than others, but the cast is great with what they have to work with.  If you're hoping for a happy ending, there are entirely too many of those and many of them are too happy - but hey, it is a Christmas movie, after all.  The few sad endings are also mostly well done. <br /> <br />No matter how many times you've seen the movie, the deleted scenes are a nice addition.  A lot of the weaker points of the story are fleshed out a bit more, and we even see a few plot twists that ended up being abandoned.  (Apparently the running time would have been well over three hours if they had all been included!)  The commentary is also terrific, probably the best I've heard on any DVD.  Besides lots of interesting trivia on the evolution of the movie (Why the token American character?  Where did they get that great airport footage?), they also reveal an intended ending that was apparently abandoned early on and never even filmed.  You'll never guess it, but you'll probably like it if you like the movie in general. <br /> <br />Happy Christmas, luv!
0689859414|5.0|This handsome book is the kind of book that kids would sequester themselves in a treehouse and read for hours, comparing notes, sharing insights. It's one of those rare series, Spiderwick, that keeps kids and grownups waiting eagerly for the next volume because the world it portrays is so real, so rich and so rewarding. Perfect gift book for a ten to thirteen year old boy! If you haven't read SPiderwick series, never fear: they'll be around for many years.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I remember buying this album and \\"This is the Moody Blues\\" (a double compilation) sometime late in 1978. Of the two this one got most played and rates as one of the great live albums I have ever heard. For me bands typically have up to 3 great live albums in them. 1. When they are new / fresh / energetic / confident. 2. Normally when they are at their creative peak, fully confident and feel on top of the world normally touring on the back of a great album. 3. The last is normally an anniversary type event (eg 20 years, a farewell concert etc). Example of these would be Rush (1. All the worlds a stage,  2. Exit Stage Left and 3. R30) and Dream Theater (1. Live at the Marquee, 2. Live Scenes from New York and 3. Score.    For me \\"Bursting Out Live\\" is Jethro Tull during their most creative and confident period. The band are in full flight and everyone gives a superb performance (Ian Anderson - Lead Vocal, Flute, Acoustic Guitar, Martin Barre - Guitar, Barriemore Barlow - Drums, John Evan - Keyboards, John Glascock - Bass Guitar (shortly before his early death from a heart attack in 1979). Definitive versions of Tull classics \\"Aqualung / Locomotive Breath\\", \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\", \\"New Day yesterday\\" and the fantastic 2 minute version of \\"Thick as a brick\\" are found here, and they absolutely smoke, sheer brilliance. Ian Anderson's humour between songs is very good and the whole show just works so well.     I can't speak highly enough of this set, it's one of my favourite Live albums over the past 35 years (refer list below ***). If you do decide to get this one I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. 10 out of 10.    *** Certainly one of my favourite live albums over the last 35 years (here are some of my other favourites)...   *** Some of my favourite Live albums over the past 35 years ...   - \\"How the West was won\\" from Led Zeppelin (1972)   - \\"Made in Japan\\" from Deep Purple (1972)   - \\"Yessongs\\" from Yes (1973)   - \\"Welcome back my friends\\" from ELP (1973)   - \\"Too late to stop now\\" from Van Morrison (1974)   - \\"On your feet or on your knees\\" from Blue Oyster Cult (1975)   - \\"Live in London\\" from Bruce Springsteen (1975)   - \\"One more from the Road\\" from Lynyrd Skynrd (1976)   - \\"Frampton comes alive\\" from Peter Frampton (1976)   - \\"Live Bullet\\" from Bob Seger (1976)   - \\"Seconds Out\\" from Genesis (1977)   - \\"A Live Record\\" from Camel (1978)   - \\"Bursting Out Live\\" from Jethro Tull (1978)   - \\"Two for the Show\\" from Kansas (1978)   - \\"Playing the fool\\" Gentle Giant (1978)   - \\"Waiting fro Columbus\\" from Little Feat (1978)   - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" from UFO (1979)   - \\"Live Rust\\" from Neil Young (1979).   - \\"Paris\\" from Supertramp (1980).   - \\"Exit...Stage left\\" from Rush (1981)   - \\"Under a blood red sky\\" from U2 (1983)   - \\"Stop making sense\\" from Talking Heads (1984)   - \\"Live in the city of Light\\" from Simple Minds (1986)   - \\"Live adventures of the Waterboys\\" from the Waterboys (1986)   - \\"Operation Livecrime\\" from Queensryche (1991)   - \\"Without a safety Net\\" from Big Country (1992)   - \\"Secret World Live\\" from Peter Gabriel (1994)   - \\"Together in Concert\\" from Tim Finn, Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga (2000)   - \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" from Dream Theater (2000)   - \\"Hullabaloo\\" from Muse (2002)   - \\"Out West\\" from Gomez (2005)   - \\"Instant Delivery\\" from Flower Kings (2006).   - \\"Okonokos\\" from My Morning Jacket (2006)
B000002LQR|5.0|In the summer of 2005, Spin magazine released a list of the top 100 albums from 1985-2005, and somehow they left this album off the list.  I was pretty apalled.<br /><br />This is one of the best rock albums I've ever heard.  Very little can a band showing off so much diversity, from funk to hard rock to something just psychadelic.  Not only is every song great (from the tunes that got airtime like \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and \\"Breaking the Girl\\" to deep tracks such as \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" and \\"The Righteous and the Wicked\\"), but the continuity of this album is out of this world.  The tracks are perfectly placed, and work together to paint a bigger picture.  In fact, I would place a bet that they were written to go together, because the beat, key, and feel of every song works with those before and after it.  If you haven't heard this album yet, it's totally worth picking up.
B000067FP8|5.0|I loved Gizmo in the first one and this second movie. I don't like all the ugly and gross gremlins though. I thought both dvds was equally good.
0060977493|4.0|Arundhati Roy's \\"The God of Small Things\\" is intimately concerned with the minutiae of life, particular rural life in the Indian state of Kerala. Her fixation with the seemingly trivial aspects of this life slowly lulls the reader into a polemic that reveals India, and specifically middle class Christian life within Kerala, to be far from this picturesque world of familial affection, spiritual enlightenment, harmonious tradition, peaceful coexistence and bastion of progressive thinking and intellectualism that many politically correct minded western thinkers and social critics tend to depict India to be. Through the guise of fiction and the employment of language that is resplendent in vivid imagery Roy provides a cogent exposition emphasizing the very duplicity that lies at the very heart of this idealistic portrayal of the subcontinent; a depiction that is peddled by its inhabitants and credulously accepted by western minds. Though Roy does a superb in her nonfiction essays and books (An Ordinary Person's Guide To Empire, The Cost of Living, War Talk, Power Politics and The Algebra of Infinite Justice) in showing the morass of contradictions that is India and the United States, to do it through the medium of fiction makes it seem less caustic to politically correct minds that idealize eastern life at the expense of truth.   <br /> <br />Roy's \\"The God of Small Things\\" demonstrates that behind the happy veneer of Indian family life that westerners envy, there is a elaborate system of control exercised on children through guilt and fear mongering by elders insistent on sustaining patriarchal hegemony. Underneath all this talk of faith within Christian circles in Kerala there is a people almost pathologically obsessed with the accumulation of material wealth and the attainment of higher status, aims which are inimical to their professed devotion to Christian living. Despite India's boasting of its millennia old traditions its rapid assimilation of western art, vernacular and mores underscores a society that is losing its identity, and more importantly (though none of them admit it) it reveals a society that maybe ashamed of itself in relation to its western counterparts. <br /> <br />When all is said and done Roy's \\"The God of Small Things\\" is merely another manifestation of thE activist persona that has made her a world-renowned progressive lector and writer.  It naturally follows then that her only fictional work will be an unflinching appraisal of a collective mindset that brims with sanctimony as it vainly pays homage to its own visage; a visage that \\"The God of Small Things\\" artfully dismantles. Since the task Roy sets out to do is, in the final analysis rhetorical, elements that have become part and parcel of most popular novels, such as intricate plot developments and twists are subordinated for rich character development and highly descriptive and detailed accounts of environments and the machinations that transpire in the course of human interaction.  <br /> <br />The mouthing of novel's truths emanates from the youngest characters in the novel, that of two twin children living in rural Kerala, Rahel and Estha. From their own verbal outbursts within the novel, to the injustices observed through their innocent gaze, we ascertain the abject social, economic, and moral environment, which enshrines their very existence.   <br /> <br />It is through a candor that can only stem from a child's mind, do we see that something is quite awry with the adult world that surrounds them. It is in there endearing mimicking of their Uncle Chacko's own verbal overtures to Western culture and his hubris, induced by British Ivy League education, and the dotting of their class conscious grandmother over their mixed cousin Sophie mol, that we find the exemplification of the typical Indian mindset that is torn between being loyalty to ones own culture, and the secret yearning to distance oneself from that culture out of a an unspoken understanding that it is in someway inferior to the Anglo/Colonial complex that has pervaded those that Europeans have subjugated throughout history.  <br /> <br />However the greatest travesties that the reader is made privy to involves a fatal night that forever changed the future of their mother, Ammu, and resulted in the loss of their half Anglo cousin Sophie Mol. It is in this climax to \\"God of Small Things\\" and the resulting scars that touch everyone around them - including those who antagonize them - that we see Roy's greatest illustration of how the Indian plight is created and perpetuated by Indians themselves. There is no feeble plea for sympathy here. This isn't a book about victim hood. It is a book that shows that the sacred cow we call \\"culture\\"; a thing the politically correct crowd refuses criticize, maybe the culprit behind much of what ails us. Kudos to Roy for being intrepid enough to do what other so called progressives are reticent to do. <br /> <br />Yet this very insightful critique of the various shortcomings of Indian life cannot be gleaned from the climax of Roy's narrative unless one pays careful attention to all the character developments and small events that these characters are subject to. This is why it is important that the reader endure some things in Roy's prose that are less than appealing, such as her insistence in using child like word play and overly descriptive verbiage in her depiction of scenery. It is incumbent of the person who reads Roy's work to connect the dots, internalize the sadness contained in its page, and hopefully garner something resembling an explanation for why the dictatorship of tradition can be given unfettered power to enslave and destroy the ones who should benefit from its power.  <br /> <br />I will grant that as a person who was raised with a bit of both the Indian/Malayalee (i.e. people who come from Kerala) culture, and the American, it is easier for me to see where Roy is coming from, than say someone fromthe outside. However, even the outsider can appreciate what Roy has to say because the problems Roy underscores permeate us universally.  <br />
B00005QJDG|5.0|I remember buying this album late in 2001. It seemed to take forever which was all to do with the unfortunate events of September 11 and the one in a million chance of a band releasing an album on the same day with a cover showing fire streaming out of the World Trade Centre and the New York sky line! A desperate attempt to retract the already shipped copies so they could be replaced with a more \\"sensitive\\" cover. The wait was all worth it though for Dream Theater deliver a live album in support of their masterpiece \\"Scenes from a memory\\". For me bands typically have up to 3 great live albums in them. 1.

B000EQ5SRK|4.0|There's plenty of sex, with heavy breathing, sweat and tears. So if you're looking for a plot, but want to see Sharon Stone get busy as well, this is the film for you. Plot development is not up to par, but I don't think that was the focus of the producer. There is, however, a mystery and a guessing game that does leave you wondering who-dunnit. It's a movie characteristic of the era, so expect some predictable elements. The film is entertaining, though. NOT a family picture.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Well, after giving this album a listen to over my computer's 5.1 THX-certified speaker system, I can easily give the guys 5 stars for the instrumentals.  They're all spot on, but I gotta be honest here.  As much as I've been a fan of Bruce's (having recently gotten all his solo stuff), I think his voice is fading a bit.  They're slightly weak on this album.  Not bad, but it sounds like he's getting to a point in his life that his voice is just about shot.  I don't know, it could have been the recording technique used for this album, but from other sources such as YouTube videos) I've seen of Bruce singing lately, it's even apparent in them, that his voice is hurting.<br /><br />Anyway, the album does have some very interesting instrumentals.  Very Maiden-esk of old.  Lot's of Dave Murray influence.  Steve Harris' bass comes through very strongly in all songs.  Jannick and Adrian do a good job as well.  Even Nicko's drumtracks are good.  But like I said, it sounds like ol' Brucey is struggling a bit.  Oh, don't get me wrong, this is still a strong Maiden album.  Probably one of the best Maiden albums since the pre-Blaze days.  Some compare it to Seventh Son, but I'd say it's a mixture of Brave New World, Dance of Death, with perhaps some No Prayer for the Dying influence thrown in.<br /><br />I may change my over-all opinion of the album after further listen, but for right now, this is how I see it.  I usually need to hear a CD in my truck before I can really determine how I like it.  My PC's speakers are great and the sub really adds to the bass, but sometimes it drowns out the mid-range and therefore I miss some of the lighter nuances that my truck speaker system can give me.  So I'll give this CD a few more listens and I may come back to revise my review here.<br /><br />But overall, AMOLAD is a still a solid Maiden release, so if you're a Maiden fan of old or a new one, be sure to check this third album of the Return of Bruce Trilogy.<br /><br />EDIT:  Oh, it just dawned on me what the deal is with the vocals on this album.  It seems like they're just there.  By that mean they don't really match any of the musical cues.  It's basically just Bruce wailing over typical Maiden music.  In most prior Maiden outings, the music tended to match the rhythym of the of vocals, but not here so much.  Oh there's a few instances of matching, but for the most part it's just Bruce singing over the rest of the guys jamming.<br /><br />UPDATE #2:  Well, just as feared...well, thought.  My PC speakers, as good as they are, tend to drown out the vocals with overwhelming bass from the sub.  So I've had a listen to the CD in my truck and the vocals are just as good and strong as on any other Maiden album.  Therefore, I'm uping my rating score to 4.5 stars by giving Bruce a full star bump-up.  And another thing I noticed is that the vocals do go pretty good with the instrumentals.  There's only a few songs that have such instances where the vocals don't quite match the instrumentals.  But overall they do.  So disregard what I said above.  This is a great ablum and I expect it to get a lot of play in my CD deck.is with the vocals on this album.  It seems like they're just there.

B00005RYL2|5.0|There's nothing like a good story well told. In a lot of fantasy/action flicks, the audience spends a lot of time trying to figure out what in the world is going on. Highlander keeps the present day action moving at a good pace while allowing for flashbacks that bring viewers up to speed.<br /><br />The cast plays to tell the story, not to be \\"stars.\\" Sean Connery who is always wonderful to watch plays a secondary but important role as Connor's mentor. Connery's wit and physical presence makes a potentially heavy character come to life.<br /><br />Christopher Lambert is fine in this role though it seems like it could have been better done by an actor who slipped into the characters skin better. His acting is competent but not entirely satisfying.<br /><br />A small nuance in the film was set design, make up, and costuming. One thing that drives me crazy in historical films is how CLEAN everyone looks. This product gives you the feeling of really being in 16th century Scotland. Lots of dirty faces, ragged clothing, and matted hair. One film for which you wouldn't want \\"Smell-o-vision.\\"<br /><br />I also liked casting Roxanne Hart as Connors love interest. She's supposed to be a cop and looks it. She plays the role with a nice balance of curiousity, toughness, and vulnerability. The 1980's poodle hair detracts a little but most actresses in 1980 films had atrocious poodle hair and bad perms.<br /><br />Connor's nemesis, the 7-foot brute from the steppes of Russia is one of the films best characters. Nasty, brutish, and terrifying with a wicked dark sense of humor. Often times fantasy films take themselves and their mythology too seriously and for that reason come across as ponderous. It's not often you get an evil barbarian with an ironic sense of humor.<br /><br />Finally, what makes the film one of my favorites is the soundtrack. Queen! The ultimate 70's band. A band that practically defined flamboyance and big hair. With the campiest, most flamboyant lead singer of the decade, Freddy Mercury. For all their goofiness, the members of Queen were solid, accomplished musicians and their music is filled with wit and melodic hooks. Princes of Universe is the perfect sound to open this film.

B000005IS1|5.0|This is insane for 1968. Comparable to Motorhead, and years ahead of it's time. It would definately give Lemmy a run for his money, and even many modern alternative artists such as Disturbed don't even compare to the ridiculous hardness of the MC5. Rock On!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I became a full fledged John Mayer fan after hearing his song \\"Daughters.\\"  As I listened to this melody, I sat, trying to really hear the words being sung and understand why John Mayer chose to sing of such themes that not very many artists are willing to vocalize.  Continuum sustains this philosophy and John Mayer continues to amaze me with his lyrics and sound.  He performs with such vividness that I cannot help but feel his meloncholy, his passion, and his ambition. The album is more bluesy than his first but yet the melodies are pure John Mayer.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|Ok, we're all fans. We wouldn't be here, reviewing and buying an album in it's first week if we weren't. Most of us have been buying Maiden albums for a long, long time and know exactly what we're going to get. That's both a blessing and a curse with these guys. There are basically two schools of thought on Iron Maiden at this point.     1) Thank god for Maiden! They never sell out and you know just what the next album is going to sound like!    and:    2) Oh god another Maiden album. Gallop gallop, diddly-diddly. You can tell what the next album is going to sound like before it comes out!    Well both are right of course, they do pretty-much all sound the same since the late 80's, and whether that's a good or a bad thing is entirely up to you.     My problem with Maiden over the last few albums, isn't so much that they sound alike, but that the thin, outdated production and lame, polite drumming (sorry Nicko, I love ya but..), has more-or-less made them, at least to my ears kind of sound old, and tired. Nothing comes roaring out of the speakers at you the way Running Free or Wrathchild did. Nothing sounds particularly heavy or intense. Listen to Judas Priest's Painkiller or Angel Of Retribution then listen to Dance Of Death. The brutal, opening firepower of Painkiller blew-back your hair and pinned you to the seat of your car. When was the last time Maiden knocked you over with agressive power? A long, time. Priest still manages to sound rude, loud, young and ticked-off. I realize that they are different bands, with different styles, but every Maiden album since the mid 80's sounds to me, like they are all sitting in chairs and tapping their feet while they play. There's just no aggression.    Well they seem to have drank a pot of coffee during these sessions, because there's a bit more \\"oomph\\" to the material here. The guitars have a bit more heavy \\"chunk\\" to them, especially on \\"Breeg\\". Adrian Smith's influence I expect. When was they last time you heard Maiden really Headbang? It was really nice to hear Maiden sound a little angry again. Also, there are actually a few of Bruce's vocal lines that actually don't sound like the same 4 he's been singing since Fear of the Dark. Although a bit tepid, The opening track has Bruce singing in a low baritone with an unusual vocal line.     Sure, there are a few 4-minute songs dragged-out into 10 minute epics, but at least this time the riffs and diddlys are catchier, and played with more muscle. Quite to my suprise I found Janick's \\"Pilgrim\\" to be the coolest and catchiest riff since \\"Powerslave\\", using a similar middle-easter raga mode.     I think Maiden is on the right track here overall, but good gravy, they really need to stop trying to be Jethro Tull and just strip things down and kick some butt again. But It's really the production that's the problem, and they have to try a new, younger producer soon to avoid going out with a whimper. I sure don't want to see that happen to my heroes. Imagine letting them do what they've always done, but have Vinny Paul produce? Ahh...just the thought of it :)    Basically, if you really disliked the last few albums, this one probably won't win you over, but if like me, you keeping buying them, hoping that the boys will shake things up a little, then you may want to check this out. Yeah, it's the same, but better.

B000HEYVD6|3.0|David Baldacci is not a great author, but he is generally a good one.  None of his books are classics of the suspense genre, but they are fun reads and he has consistently delivered these decent books.  Unfortunately, even the best baseball player occasionally strikes out, and with The Camel Club, Baldacci has written a sub-par book:  not truly awful, but not good either. <br /> <br />This muddled novel deals with a conspiracy to commit a terrorist act with the President the apparent target.  The Camel Club is the name of a quartet of eccentric characters who are brilliant but also social outcasts.  Their leader goes by the name of Oliver Stone, adopting the alias because, like the director, he is seeing conspiracies everywhere.  Occasionally, the Camel Club has, through back-door means, instituted reforms, but generally, they just get together to share weird theories.  During one such meeting in an isolated area, they witness a murder that is posed as a suicide; the victim turns out to be an agent for a high-level federal intelligence agency. The Club, for reasons that are somewhat legitimate but also somewhat paranoid, opts not to go to the police. <br /> <br />Secret Service agent Alex Ford is called in to observe the investigation, and he suspects murder even when the FBI is willing to write it off as suicide.  Ford happens to have a semi-friendship with Stone, and the latter, although not wanting to get involved, does at least push Ford in the right direction.  Ford's investigation will get him in big trouble, while the killers, aware that there were witnesses, start hunting for the Club. <br /> <br />The reason the killing has taken place has to do with an intricate plot with various government agents participating.  The focus is on a speech the President will be giving in his home town, where a whole slew of terrorists will also be appearing.  At this point the novel picks up, and the last quarter of the book is the good action that Baldacci typically delivers. <br /> <br />The problem is the first three-quarters.  The story to this point is overly complicated and relies too much on various coincidences.  Characters are in just the right place or know just the right people.  In addition, the Camel Club characters themselves are almost too eccentric, which cuts into the plausibility of the story.  This is, for the most part, a two-star work, but the last portion elevates this to a low three stars.  If you're a Baldacci fan, you will probably read this but be disappointed.  If you're unfamiliar with him, you should go elsewhere (even one of his other books) for your reading pleasure. <br />

B00006AUIG|5.0|In \\"Session 9\\", Brad Anderson offers far more than a fleeting, horrifying experience. Even though the main focus remains on psychological terror, he is not afraid to reach deep into social realism as well (an immigrant's dream gone wrong). Many factors contribute to the overall superior quality of this film: 1) The place itself - the abandoned Danvers Mental Hospital - is terrifying with its peeling walls, dark tunnels, kitchen meat hooks, lingering asbestos threat, and most of all, its history of patient abuse and lobotomy procedures - all this in a vast, labyrinth-like scale. 2) Unlike most directors of horror films these days, Anderson does not rush the plot or attack the audience with unbelievable monsters, overdone gore, and other nonsensical features that satisfy only lazy thinkers seeking uncomplicated, instant gratification. When the Hazmat Elimination Co. workers enter the hospital (ready to complete a difficult, yet well-paid job), led by their boss Gordon (Peter Mullan), Anderson lets the suspense build up slowly, giving away a hint only here and there. At the same time, everything is perfectly coordinated and attention is paid to the smallest details - every character has a secret (except for Jeff whose fear of dark is revealed at the beginning), natural sounds and sights are used in strange circumstances (e.g. loud crickets in the afternoon, a spider's image and a bird's peep tied to each new level of Gordon's disturbing thoughts) , the workers' white suits and the plastic partitions around them intensify the unsafe, claustrophobic ambience, and let's not forget the equally effective, frightening musical score! The camera work is fantastic - there is a number of outstanding close-up shots throughout the film. Every actor has greatly contributed to the ultimate success of the film, but Peter Mullan as Gordon deserves an extra applause - an excellent actor without a doubt, his multiple, intense facial expressions remain etched in my memory. 3) And then there's the real case of Mary Hobbes and her multiple personality disorder - the few photos of her shown throughout the film make the horror uncomfortably and effectively authentic. (The voice-over actress for her three voices - Mary, Princess, and Billy - did a frighteningly great job.)  And the voice of the evil itself - Simon - kept cleverly at the distance until the end when Gordon's and Mary's personal stories converge with a horrifying force. This film is a true gem if one takes the time to understand it - minute by minute, day by day, session by session - until the ultimate session 9!ere's the real case of Mary Hobbes and her multiple personality disorder - the few photos of her shown throughout the film make the horror uncomfortably and effectively authentic.

B0009A40ES|4.0|\\"An American Psycho\\" is one of those films that people seem to find very difficult to come to grips with. Is it a masterpiece deserving of praise? Is it a completely boring, insensitive piece of sick trash? Or is it something in between? Through all this argument though, there is one thing that cannot be denied. That this film will provoke a reaction from the viewer whether it is feelings of disgust, praise, amusement, unease or all of the above. Well, unless of course the viewer is in a similar state of mind as Patrick Bateman that is. <br /> <br />You see, Patrick Bateman externally appears to be everything a man could want to be. He has a body to die for, a big earning job and all the worldly possessions that come with the territory. Yet despite all this, Patrick finds it difficult to feel anything. He states in the film that he feels no human emotions other than \\"greed and disgust\\" and it's this complete lack of connection with the world that drives him to violence. However, even these extreme outbursts of gruesome bloodshed still can't make him feel anything but empty and only distance him further from humanity, driving him towards madness. <br /> <br />Christian Bale's performance as Patrick is simply stunning. He fills the character with humour, anger, charm, intelligence and copious amounts of vanity. Christian makes even the strangest of scenarios in Patrick's existence appear to be completely realistic for him. An example of such bizarre behaviour is the way he verbally critiques Huey Lewis and the News while murdering a colleague. Or when he decides another colleague should die for the simple fact that they now have a better business card than he does. These occurrences are as funny as they are unsettling but never unintentionally so. The direction is perfectly understated and considering the extreme nature of the book it is based on, the screenplay is as loyal as decency (amongst the general movie going population anyway) and budget would allow. I shouldpoint out though that I have not yet read the book and this review is based only on the movie itself and not the quality of the adaptation. <br /> <br />\\"An American Psycho\\" is not for the faint of heart and yet there essentially isn't all that much on-screen gore. Not to say that killing people with chainsaws and axes isn't gory, only that these brutal acts of slaughter are mostly either only suggested or just out of the cameras view. But more than the acts themselves, many viewers will find the nonchalant, motiveless way in which Patrick conducts them far more disturbing, not to mention his degrading use of women as self gratifying objects. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoy this movie. Despite all the disconcerting aspects of the story it remains an entertaining film and multiple viewings have definitely been rewarding. The only way in which I feel this film is not a complete success is in the ambiguousness of its final moments. Although it certainly makes a great discussion point post viewing, I can't help but feel it to be frustrating and slightly unnecessary. I have my views on what it all means, but I won't mention them here as I don't want to ruin things for those that haven't seen the movie yet. Besides, I have to return some video tapes.

067960085X|5.0|After recently seeing the award-winning film Capote, I made a conscious decision that I simply needed to read more of Capote's work. Philip Seymour Hoffman was absolutely brilliant as the tortured writer, and he made me realise that there was a lot more to Capote than  In Cold Blood.<br /><br />I read  ICB  in high school at a time when I was full of teenage conspiracy theories and thrived on books like  Helter Skelter.  Needless to say I was absolutely fascinated by Capote's investigation and obsession of a rural multiple murder that rocked America. However, after reading Capote's 'one great book,' I failed to read anything else by him.<br /><br />Published in 1958, eight years before  ICB, Breakfast at Tiffany's: A Short Novel and Three Stories  is comprised of the main work as well as the less famous shorts \\"House of Flowers,\\" \\"A Diamond Guitar\\" and \\"A Christmas Memory.\\" Ashamedly, I have never seen the film version with Audrey Hepburn playing the lead role of Holly Golighty but, due to the sheer infamy of the film, as well as Hepburn's face adorning the front cover of the book, I couldn't have pictured the protagonist as anyone else.<br /><br />Set in 1940s New York City, the book is narrated by an unnamed male writer (whom Golighty nicknames Fred after her estranged brother) who forges a friendship with society gal Holly Golighty whilst they are living in the same brownstone. As he descibes her antics, the narrator's naïveity is quickly erased by Golighty's bold, brazen lifestyle of men, martinis and money. The social attitudes that Capote expresses in the novel are way ahead of their time. In fact, certain details and ideas that must have been scandalous then still manage to maintain their shock factor 50 years on.<br /><br />Although the writer's character in the film (played by George Peppard) is named Paul 'Fred' Varjak, the narration has an autobiographical feel to it. I drew many parallels between the narrator of the book and Capote himself (his childlikeinnocence, his escape to the big city, etc.) which caused me to envision Capote beside Hepburn's Golighty.<br /><br />Although just over 100 pages,  Breakfast at Tiffany's  feels like an epic in terms of the strength and vividness of the main character. Holly Golighty literally jumps off the page. Like Scarlett O'Hara, she is a literary heroine of the 20th century and Capote's ability to bring her story full-circle in so few pages is truly amazing.<br /><br />The shorts are very strong, as well, particularly \\"House of Flowers,\\" which is set in Haiti and proves that Capote is just as comfortable writing in a relatively foreign setting as he is in his natural habitat.<br /><br />To read more reviews like this, please visit my blog 'The Book Wormhole' at [...]

B00005JP5J|4.0|The movie starts out strong with a hilarious ensemble cast of eccentric characters. Most of the Hoover family are living a frustrated and miserable existence as they try to make their individual \\"dreams come true.\\" The only one who is isn't bitter is little 7 year old Olive who wants to win \\"The Little Miss Sunshine\\" beauty pageant. Olive isn't your typical beauty queen. But when the winner of her local pageant is unable to compete in the finals she is given her opportunity. Her father, Richard Hoover, is obsessed with winning. So he insists the family must make a last minute road trip to California so Olive can be a \\"winner.\\"  The road trip portion of the film has it's funny moments. But does tend to bog down, as the family's mechanical troubles and other typical \\"wacky hi-jinks\\" aren't nearly as smart and original as the rest of the movie.    The film really starts to run on all cylinders again when the family finally arrives at the pageant. Up until now the Hoover family had largely ignored the pageant world that little Olive longed to be a part of. But upon being exposed to the sick and twisted world of childhood beauty contests they are repulsed. At first they try to protect their daughter. But then allow her to participate so she can fulfill her \\"dream.\\" By now they have finally realized the error of their self-centered ways and manage to unite as a family that loves and cares about each other.     Along with the importance of family, the central theme of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is about our society's obsession with \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\". Their desire to be \\"winners\\" was actually making the Hoover family miserable. Only when they let go of this obsession with \\"winning\\" were the family able to come together and be happy. Brother Dwayne sums it up best when he says it's better to just do what you love and forget the rest. This is a sweet, charming and funny movie, definitely worth seeing.
0307346609|5.0|(Warning: This Review may contain Spoilers)<br /><br />First of all, let me say, I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I read it in two sittings, which is almost a record for me, that alone puts it high in the running of awesome books I've ever read.  Now, I am not much of a Horror reader and am a relative newcomer to the \\"Zombie scene\\" but that did not stop me from enjoying this work.<br /><br />I spent most of my time reading this book in a kind of uncomfortable, creepy, \\"I wish I wasn't reading this\\" trance.  The tone was excellent.  The characters all memorable and enjoyable for the most part.  Having spent time in many of the places discussed in this book I found it very easy to visualize 90% of what was described. (Maybe that's why I didn't sleep well.)<br /><br />Some of my favorite sections of the book: I enjoyed the two Japanese \\"warrior monks\\" kinda cliche but fun. As a Marine Combat Arms Officer and career level school graduate I found myself just kind of nodding in a really, \\"I'm getting queazy\\" way at the description of the Battle of Yonkers.  It's the type of thing that I've thought about the Army for years, I could just really see it happening!  An earlier reviewer referred to the \\"BAT-21\\" scenario, that made me roll my eyes.  Now, it wasn't my favorite story in the book, (I'm no fan of Pilots, or the Air Force, and I'm a Citadel graduate so I have my \\"opinions\\" about women in the military.)  BUT!!! I did think it was a neat story, I kinda saw it coming, but I liked it. (And, YES, I got the whole \\"Mets=Metis, mother of Athena reference\\" I'm a Jarhead, but I'm not a dumb one!)  And when it came to the memories of most of the \\"civilian\\" Americans, I just kind of nodded and said to myself, \\"Yep.  That's how it would happen.\\"  Also, the one about the fighting under the city of Paris, that just made me do one of those full body shivers.<br /><br />Now, I did find the \\"global collapse\\" a little hard to swallow, governments are soft and slow moving and indecisive but not all of them.  I was surprised at the Palestinian-Israeli merger, surprised that anybody would ever think it was a good idea and surprised that Max Brooks (son of Mel Brooks) would put such thoughts to paper.  But the thought of the two most tenacious tribes of the Middle East teaming up to do battle together made me pity the Zombies.  I felt the same way whenever I read one of the \\"Russian\\" scenarios, \\"Yep, that's exactly what the Russians would do.\\" I said many times, because they would!  One of the big take aways from the book was the trend of defense plans that started in South Africa and was duplicated by all the other countries in the book.  Draconian, cold, almost inhuman,-- Yes.  But honestly, the only way to deal with this type of scenario where the enemy is that relentless.<br /><br />My biggest (and pretty much only) complaint with the book was that in many of the cases I thought the stories ended just as they were getting good!  I'm a sucker for details, and in many cases I wanted to know more.  I also would have liked to hear the stories of survivors who held out \\"behind the lines\\" in the Blue Zones, or the Spec Ops bubbas who got dropped in to help them, or the onesies and twosies who just happened by sheer luck to survive on their own.  Some of the stories could spawn books of their own.  I would love to read, say, the history of one of the \\"Blue Zones\\" that held out, or maybe, \\"The Jarheads at Rock Island\\".  (Just in case Mr. Brooks read this review)<br /><br />Last, the politics, well, (sigh) I'm not a very political guy so I am not as \\"up in arms\\" the way a lot of the other reviewers seem to be.  I was smart enough to pick up on some of the jabs, but I just shrugged them off.  Like so many things in life we laugh because people say things that are either funny or true.  Do I think that America would roll over and die as described? No.  Do I think this book is a stretch?  Not as far as you'd think.  (And for those of you saying \\"Jesus, what kind of Marine is this guy?\\" Well, my answer is: The kind who's seen too many of his friends die for nothing.)  Personally, I think the book strikes a blow for the Gun Lobby, I sure am glad that I own as many firearms as I do.  I think the book strikes a blow for Generation X as \\"the ones who clean up their own mess\\".  And for every shot against the current Republicans (not that I am one), there was also a shot against the soft, fruity, Baby Boomers who let our society drift down the path to oblivion.<br /><br />Now, if you'll excuse me I'm off to stockpile MREs and Ammo, and then I'm going to practice Head Shots.kind of Marine is this guy?\\" Well, my answer is: The kind who's seen too many of his friends die for nothing.)

B000H305U0|5.0|On the first single from Justin Timberlake's sophomore solo outing, he's claiming to have brought \\"SexyBack,\\" and I'll be damned if he hasn't. This single (which has been at the top spot on the Billboard charts for a month) isn't even as sexy as it gets on this disc of a dozen sweet`n sweaty songs. Timberlake has tapped into the R&B and hip-hop genre without ever losing sight of his pop sensibilities, thereby creating frenzy for fans of all of the above. There isn't a dud in the bunch of dance songs, even when he slows down the groove on a very rare occasion - most especially for the final track, \\"(Another Song) All Over Again.\\" The second single, \\"My Love,\\" has already been delivered to radio, while the first single has shown no sign of slowing down. The entire production was helmed by the latest and greatest of the new millennium, Timbaland, and it is so slick, the budget will easily see a profit within the first week of sales. Word of mouth will keep it alive long after the curiosity factor has waned. With future singles on tap, such as \\"LoveStoned\\" and \\"Damn Girl,\\" it looks like it will be a long fall/winter/spring and summer stay on the charts for Mr. Timberlake. Who would've thought nearly a decade ago, when Justin had a teenage crush on the then-reigning pop princess Britney Spears, that this member of the boy band N*Sync would turn into one of the most interesting and important pop stars of the new century? I didn't, and my earshot is usually better than the neighbor's poodle. It's been said that Timberlake has always been fascinated by Michael Jackson's musical genius, and this album not only hints at that \\"rumor,\\" it downright concedes it. This CD is to Timberlake what Off The Wall was to Jackson. It firmly establishes the boy singer as a respectable adult entertainer extraordinaire. It's also apparent he's channeling Prince. Shades of the purple man's influence resonate throughout. If Jackson and Prince could've had a child, this is what he would've sounded like. It also assures us that Justin's first solo CD, Justified, was no fluke. Not only has he \\"justified\\" his love for making music, he confirms it with one of the best \\"grown-up\\" albums in years. FutureSex/LoveSounds most definitely lives up to its title. The heavy beats and synths combined with Timberlake's vocal never sounded or felt so good.ed like.

B00003CXMG|5.0|I'm a big fan of all things 1970s, and am into a lot of rock bands from that era (Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, etc, etc, etc). I'd heard about \\"Almost Famous\\", that it was a rock'n'roll kind of film, but the moment I found out it was set in the 1970s, I kept my eye out for the DVDs. Being born in the 1980s, I can't say whether this was an accurate potrait of the music scene back then, but I certainly found it interesting. <br /> <br />William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a clever kid, so clever he's been skipped ahead two grades. He likes to write, it seems, and he loves rock music and the scene that surrounds it. He wants to become a rock journalist, so he finds a local writer, who gives him a few pointers, and his first job - to write an article. William writes his article, and it goes down really well. So well, in fact, that Rolling Stone magazine give him a call, asking him to go along with Stillwater on the road on their \\"Almost Famous\\" tour. He's underage, and has lots of exams to do at school, but with a deep voice over the phone and the help of a \\"band-aid\\" by the name of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), he is off around America with the rock group. On the tour he sees the ups, the downs, the dirty and the cleaned up. He falls in love, learns a lot about himself and hears a little more than a music journalist is supposed to. To top it all off, his concerned mother keeps ringing around, trying to get him to come home! <br /> <br />It's an intriguing, involving ride, I thought. You get to see the perspective of a 1970s band, a worried 1970s parent, a 1970s fan, and a 1970s groupie. That's a lot of points of view, and they're all handled thoughtfully, I thought. I like the look of the sets and the locations. The young extras are a nice touch too. The music playing in the background really helped set the scene, I felt. Led Zeppelin, The Who, Simon & Garfunkel, plus a song from a couple of my favorite 1970s groups like Jethro Tull and Yes. It's always nice when agood film has a good soundtrack. <br /> <br />If you're interested in 1970s music, this film is definitely worth a look.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I first heard about Continuum in early 2005, when Mayer referred to his project by this title. He deliberately took his time with this record, working on-and-off with the material for the better part of two years. Though some incorrectly interpreted this as a sign that Mayer had lost artistic direction while engaging in his many side collaborations, he knew what he was doing by taking his time: he wanted every note to feel right. The arrival of Continuum this week proves that it was worth the wait. <br /> <br />Part of me expected this to be a record that would fuse the folk/pop of Room for Squares and the subject matter of Heavier Things with the blues sensibilities explored on last year's Try! The John Mayer Trio Live in Concert, particularly the uptempo tracks \\"Who Did You Think I Was\\" and \\"Try.\\" While there are elements of all these things in Mayer's new record, the overall feel is soulful and relaxed. This record is the work of a man who has matured as an artist. That is not to discount his earlier work, but if you're looking for an album of songs resembling \\"Your Body is a Wonderland,\\" you need to look elsewhere. The magic of Continuum comes from its honesty, its tasteful use of melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic materials, and the subtle, nuanced playing from Mayer and his colleagues (including both Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino - the other two thirds of the John Mayer Trio). <br /> <br />The album's first single and opening track, \\"Waiting on the World to Change,\\" addresses the frustrations that many people in this country have with the current political situation. Intelligently written, it may be the closest thing to an anti-war anthem that the current 18-35 year-old generation has come up with. At times more of an apology and explanation than call-to-action, Mayer sings of the world and its leaders \\"we just feel like we don't have the means to rise above and beat it\\" and \\"it's not that we don't care / we just know that the fight ain't fair.\\" A ballsy choiceas a first single from the record. The album's third track \\"Belief\\" follows up on some of these ideas. Under an infectious minor-key groove, Mayer sings \\"we're never gonna win the world / we're never gonna stop the war / we're never gonna beat this if belief is what we're fighting for.\\" <br /> <br />Both \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Vultures\\" will be familiar to those of Mayer's fans who purchased last year's release, Try! The John Mayer Trio Live in Concert. The songs are fully realized here: \\"Gravity\\" feels more relaxed and natural than the Try! version, and \\"Vultures\\" - an R&B-tinged song about Mayer confronting his fear of losing his artistic edge - succeeds admirably here. <br /> <br />The fingerpicked \\"Stop This Train,\\" musically harkening back to \\"3x5\\" from Room for Squares and \\"Wheel\\" from Heavier Things, explores the mortality of our parents and ourselves, as well as the constant forward motion of time and our inability to change things back to their previous state. The track features some of the strongest vocals that Mayer has ever delivered. In fact, that could be said of the whole album: Mayer has more control of his voice than on his previous records. <br /> <br />\\"In Repair\\" describes the ongoing personal struggle of moving on from a failed relationship. The guitar solo here, the best on a record full of excellent ones, speaks as eloquently as the words. The album closer, \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You,\\" another post-break up number, is a poignant, clever and sexy song with a timeless feel that couldn't have found a better position on the record. <br /> <br />Continuum is the first of Mayer's studio records that he produced himself (he co-produced it with drummer Steve Jordan). The production is outstanding - simple and clean. The packaging is similarly beautiful. <br /> <br />Mayer has called Continuum the culmination of everything he has done so far as an artist. It will certainly be exciting to see where he goes from here.  <br /> <br />4.5/5
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump, based more or less on the novel of the same name by Winston Groom, is my second favorite film of all time. It always manages to cheer me up, or make me laugh, or make me think. Plus I love all the retro footage and sets, being a big fan of all things 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br />Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a young man who isn't that smart, but still has gone on to lead an interesting life. His life leads him to all sorts of places, and he gets to meet all sorts of people, some of them celebrities of the day. He goes to college, he goes to war, he goes on TV and even to China. He loves his mama (Sally Field) and a girl named Jenny, who he has known since the first day of school (Robin Wright Penn). Sometimes it seems as if he has a destiny, other times its like he's floating round on the breeze. Maybe it's both. Whichever way, it certainly makes an interesting ride. <br /> <br />There are so many things I love about this film. I love the character of Forrest, the way he looks at things, the way he talks and interacts with people. I love the soundtrack, a mix of songs contemporary with Forrest's adventures in the 1960s and 1970s. They really add to the mood of the film, plus usually are relevant lyrically, which is a nice touch, I thought. I love the look of everything in the film, which helps the atmosphere just as much as the music. I love how this movie can make me laugh, make my cry and make me think. I love how there's always something thematically I haven't noticed before. Though it's about a not so clever man, I do believe it's a very clever film. <br /> <br />Since I love the film so much, I find the special features really interesting. Between the featurettes and the commentary, you'll discover where Lieutenant Dan's legs went, where Tom Hanks picked up Forrest's accent from, why director Robert Zemeckis chose the music he did and how they managed to get so many famous people of the past to make appearances (even though most were dead). It's pretty thorough. <br /> <br />All in all, highly recommened. It's a great, colourful film with plenty to look at and consider.
B000H7J9RQ|4.0|Back in 1986, Barbra Streisand was already starting to wean off her movie career in favor of her pet political causes. As an avid Democrat, she decided to perform an exclusive concert to raise funds for seven Democratic U.S. Senatorial candidates preparing for the November elections. In her true perfectionist fashion, she decided to hold the concert at her Malibu ranch, only invite 500 couples at a whopping $5,000 per couple and sign with HBO to have it all air as a TV special. Such was her clout at the time. Now that she has performed live several times since then (the latest to be a tour to start next month), this DVD seems marginally less indispensable, but it's still a more-than-worthy addition to any Streisand collection nonetheless.<br /><br />With a few additions like a vintage recording of her exclusive invitation, Robin Williams' full comic monologue (not terribly funny) and a new introduction Streisand filmed just for this release, the special arrives in this 20th anniversary DVD. Dressed in all-white, she is accompanied by a small eight-piece band, probably her smallest back-up ensemble onstage. Her program begins with an elegant \\"Somewhere\\" as she emerges from a cloud of smoke. Most of her signature hits are here and performed impeccably, though she has a tendency to interject altruistic comments periodically like sharing her world view of fragile ecosystems and the Chernobyl nuclear fallout disaster in the middle of \\"People\\".<br /><br />On the upside, there is a nice tribute to Judy Garland with touching renditions of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and from the 1954 \\"A Star Is Born\\", \\"A New World\\". There is a reunion of sorts with Barry Gibb on the two biggest duet hits from 1980's \\"Guilty\\", the title tune and \\"What Kind of Fool\\".  Her best performance is probably her cover of \\"Send in the Clowns\\", fresh off \\"The Broadway Album\\", though we don't get a chance to hear the parody version she performed afterward when she ridicules the Republicans in office at the time. It all ends with a rousing \\"America the Beautiful\\", which she would later sing at the 1992 Clinton inaugural ball. It's nice to have this lovely albeit brief concert for posterity with Streisand in fulsome voice and at the cusp of her political consciousness.h a rousing \\"America the Beautiful\\", which she would later sing at the 1992 Clinton inaugural ball.

B0000CABBW|3.0|\\"Whale Rider\\", a New Zealand film, is a story about a Maori tribe in modern times, with a twist of their tales and tradition thrown in. It's based on the 1987 novel of the same name. I thought I'd like it much more than I actually did, unfortunately.    Pai is a twelve year old Maori girl, the latest in a line of chiefs, an only daughter, very passionate about her people and culture, and who loves her grandfather, the chief of their region, very much. Daughters cannot go on to be chiefs, no matter how passionate they are, that is the tradition, and a tradition Pai's grandfather is determined to keep. Deciding to ignore his daughter completely, the old chief calls together all the Maori boys in the community, teaching them the old ways, the whats and the whys. In secret, Pai spys on them, learning the old ways too, creating an even bigger rift between her grandfather, a rift he refuses to mend.    I found it was rather serious and melodramatic (the dialogue, the shots, the music, the acting) like there was (or had to be) significance in everything that happened in the story. There was very little humour, which is a shame, because I'm sure I would have enjoyed the film a bit more if it had. The Maoris have a great sense of humour in real life, and its lacking a bit here. This film makes them out to be very stressed and intense, for the most part. Ah well. Through the film, I learnt a little bit about the culture of the Maoris, but considering it was one of the central parts of the film, it didn't seem to get too deep or detailed with explanations. Also, the title of the film is a bit misleading. There isn't an awful lot of whale riding, and I was looking forward to that. Where there is some, it's pretty well done, I thought.    An all right film. Worth a look, I suppose.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Many reviewers have noted that this film is for adults not children but I think any child over fourth grade or so would find it enjoyable.  I agree, though, it could give nightmares to the real wee ones.  The \\"Wheelers\\" are the creepiest characters though of course the queen who keeps many alternative heads to wear according to her mood could be a bit frightening for the kindergarten set as well.  The movie is very creative and well done and the fantasy characters really do come to life.  True L. Frank Baum fans shouldn't miss this one!
B00005JP87|4.0|Much of a film's interest starts the moment audiences see trailers for it , and such was the case with THE ILLUSIONIST. The dark themes, nice sets, pretty actors/actresses, and supernatural undertones probably drew movie-goers to the theaters after checking out the trailers. But some may be disappointed to find little else behind The Illusionist. Although this disappointment won't fall to the level of despair or hatred of the film, movie buffs may feel as if they were lied to when it doesn't deliver the high-caliber flick they were expecting.<br /><br />The story ...<br /><br />Eisenheim the Illusionist is played by Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X), and Norton does an okay job with a scripted character that seems to have few emotions. Eisenheim's life has focused on his magical craft since he left his hometown and the love of his life, Sophie (Jessica Biel, ELIZABETHTOWN), a fellow teenager who's way above Eisenheim's station. Fifteen years later we find Eisenheim in Vienna only to discover that Sophie, now a beautiful young baroness, slated to marry into the upper echelon of royalty. Her husband-to-be is the dangerous and manipulating Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, DARK CITY). But when Eisenheim and Sophie try to rekindle their love interest, deadly forces are at play and are ready to rip them apart again. One of these forces is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti, CINDERELLA MAN), the upstart of a poor butcher who's trying to rise to a power all his own (Viennese Mayor Uhl? Nice ring to it, eh?).<br /><br />Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan in which she can detach herself from the Crown Prince, but the plan seems doomed from the start. Sophie's life is put in danger and Eisenheim has to use his incredible illusionist powers to help save their lives and their love. But can it work?<br /><br />As with the title and the main character, much of what is seen is complete illusion. But if one watches carefully, they can pick up on hints of what is truly going on. \\"Make us disappear,\\" Sophie pleads with Eisenheim at the beginning of the film as they cower in a hut. And that he cannot do so obviously affects the rest of his life and the rest of the film.<br /><br />The shinning stars in The Illusionist are Giamatti, Sewell, and, surprisingly, Biel. Although the entire focus of the film is around Norton's character, it's tough to get \\"into\\" him when what he mostly does is sit on a stage and make soulful apparitions appear by looking as if he were having a particularly tough bowel movement.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti really steals the show here. How great it is to see someone of Giamatti's chops FINALLY get the recognition he deserves and star in some great roles. Now he's proving that he's not just a co-star (THE TRUMAN SHOW, SAVING  PRIVATE RYAN). His Inspector Uhl character is miles away from ...well ...Miles in his career launching SIDEWAYS film. That the audience both roots for Uhl and hopes he fails is evidence of Giamatti's great acting ability.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell is the bad guy everyone loves to hate. He's done it time and again (A KNIGHT'S TALE, HELEN OF TROY, etc.) and pulls in a wonderfully slimy character portrayal here, too.<br /><br />But Jessica Biel is the biggest surprise. Looking both pretty and elegant, Biel goes further than she's ever gone before - far beyond 7th HEAVEN and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - and may have cemented herself as an actress with Oscar-caliber potential.<br /><br />The biggest letdown for film-o-philes will be that The Illusionist doesn't expand much beyond what they saw in the film's trailers a few months ago. But it does entertain, and it's visually interesting and well shot. Just don't expect too much from the script and you'll probably be just fine.y going on. \\"Make us disappear,\\" Sophie pleads with Eisenheim at the beginning of the film as they cower in a hut.

B00001QEE9|5.0|This has got to be at least in the top three of the many animated movies the Disney studios produced.  So many great characters are in it - Cleo, Jiminy Crickit, The Good Fairy, Gepetto, Honest John, Monstro and of course Pinocchio himself.  So many good hummable songs too including  \\"An Actor's Life\\", I've Got No Strings to Hold Me Down, and the most famous \\"When You Wish Upon A Star.\\"  The story is original and the plot exciting without being too scary for little ones and all ends happily.  Don't miss the ride at Disneyland either!
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Just wanted to make a quick note for anyone who wants to play this movie on their XBox (the original, not 360) using the DVD kit with remote. <br /> <br />When we put in the second disc with the original theatrical release, we got a screen asking us to select between the disc's special features or the XBox demo that's on the same disc.  But the remote would not work, so we could not select either option.  After much frustration, it finally occurred to us to plug in the XBox controller and use it to select the first option.  That worked, and took us to the movie's menu screen, where we could then use our remote to play the movie. <br /> <br />Perhaps this is common knowledge among many XBox users, but it would have been nice if they had put a note on that screen to use the controller to make a selection.  Anyway, just wanted to pass this on in case it will help anyone!

B000HCO83Q|4.0|WARNING!  Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />I may be among the few who liked this one better than the previous two.  It probably was never going to be possible to create an X-Men finale that was going to please everyone.  I'll confess that there were a number of things in the three-film sequence that I didn't care for.  But give the team an \\"A\\" for effort in at least trying to do something interesting and compelling.  My complaint with the first film was that it was so safe and tame.  It didn't try to take the X-Men saga anywhere new or interesting.  THE LAST STAND did.  For the record, my complaint with the series is that it managed to make Rogue an unessential and uninteresting member of the team.  Of all the incarnations of Rogue, this one was the least powerful and the least complex.  Anna Paquin did a fine job given the script they provided, but she should have been far more empowered than she was.<br /><br />Most movies based on the comics suffer from a failure of nerve.  The writers want to play it safe, don't want to offend, and refuse to take risks.  THE LAST STAND takes a world of risks and leaves the X-Men universe shaken from top to bottom.  I loved that!  I didn't think all the gambles paid off.  The Phoenix story was not as interesting as it has been in the past.  Part of the problem with the Phoenix is that they tried to incorporate it with too many other arcs, including the \\"cure\\" of the mutant gene.<br /><br />Most of all, this film, unlike the previous two, really made me care how the story ended.  In the previous two, one figured everyone would be alive at the end, so in a way precisely what happened wouldn't matter all that much.  But in this one once Mystique had been \\"cured\\" and Scott and Xavier killed, there was a great sense of danger.  Not every one was going to emerge OK in this one.  Who would have imagined that the film would have ended with Xavier, Scott, and Jean dead, and Mystique, Magneto, and Rogue stripped of their powers?<br /><br />I loved the fact that they included some of the X-Men neglected in the previous films.  Kelsey Grammer was excellent as Hank McCoy, but I thought Ellen Page was perfect as Kitty Pryde, who has always been one of my favorite X-Men, mainly because her power of being able to pass through solid objects (or having solid objects pass through her) made her fascinating because employing it required so much strategy.  The sequence where she and Juggernaut engage one another was a lot of fun.  Vinnie Jones was almost unrecognizable, by the way, as Juggernaut.  Sidenote:  Many X-Men fans are bothered by the fact that traditionally Juggernaut is not a mutant.  Therefore, in the scene where his powers are stripped temporarily by the mutant who robs other mutants of their ability, he should have been unaffected.  But on narrative grounds I can understand why they altered this in the film.<br /><br />I can understand why so many fans of the comic disliked the final movie in the trilogy.  It was a sharp departure from most of the various versions of the X-Men saga found in so many of the comics and cartoon shows.  But I was ecstatic to see them try something really different and risky.  They didn't take the safe route.  And I personally found the story far more interesting than the first two films precisely for that reason.  Yeah, I wish Rogue had been conceived differently in the trilogy and I wish the Phoenix story had been handled better, but I realize that because there have been so many permutations of the X-Men, everyone is going to contruct their own private version.  This isn't quite the version I would have come up with had I the ability to cherry pick the elements I like, but this one managed the most important task:  it made the story interesting.ed some of the X-Men neglected in the previous films.  Kelsey Grammer was excellent as Hank McCoy, but I thought Ellen Page was perfect as Kitty Pryde, who has always been one of my favorite X-Men, mainly because her power of being able to pass through solid objects (or having solid objects pass through her) made her fascinating because employing it required so much strategy.  The sequence where she and Juggernaut engage one another was a lot of fun.  Vinnie Jones was almost unrecognizable, by the way, as Juggernaut.  Sidenote:  Many X-Men fans are bothered by the fact that traditionally Juggernaut is not a mutant.  Therefore, in the scene where his powers are stripped temporarily by the mutant who robs other mutants of their ability, he should have been unaffected.  But on narrative grounds I can understand why they altered this in the film.    I can understand why so many fans of the comic disliked the final movie in the trilogy.  It was a sharp departure from most of the various versions of the X-Men saga found in so many of the comics and cartoon shows.  But I was ecstatic to see them try something really different and risky.  They didn't take the safe route.  And I personally found the story far more interesting than the first two films precisely for that reason.  Yeah, I wish Rogue had been conceived differently in the trilogy and I wish the Phoenix story had been handled better, but I realize that because there have been so many permutations of the X-Men, everyone is going to contruct their own private version.  This isn't quite the version I would have come up with had I the ability to cherry pick the elements I like, but this one managed the most important task:  it made the story interesting.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|Considering that George Lucas has pretty much disowned the original cuts of the 1977-83 \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, it's not too surprising that the picture and sound quality of the DVD reissues--which Lucas swore would never happen--is noticeably inferior to the meddled-with \\"Special Edition\\" versions that were issued on disc in 2004. \\"Star Wars\\" in particular looks pinkish and fuzzy compared to the reworked \\"Special Edition\\" on Disc 1 of this 2-disc set. Plainly Lucas wasn't going to expend any more money than he had to on getting these original theatrical versions ready for DVD. It all feels like another nose-thumbing at the longtime fans--as though Lucas is saying, \\"Okay, you got what you asked for. Happy now?\\"    Even so, whenever I sit down to watch \\"Star Wars\\" (here simply called \\"Star Wars,\\" the title it went by until its 1981 re-release, when the subtitle \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" was added), \\"Empire\\" or \\"Jedi\\" from start to finish, it will be via these relatively low-res transfers of the originals. It's not because they represent the nostalgia of movies I stood in line to see all those years ago, but because they simply offer better, purer storytelling, without the obsessive and revisionist tinkering that clutters up the \\"digitally remastered\\" (as though cleaning up the special effects was the only change that was made) 2004 versions. The George Lucas of 30 years ago, who among other things had to disguise the fact that sometimes R2-D2 was pulled along by a string, was a more inventive filmmaker than the Emperor who lorded over the CGI universe of the \\"prequel\\" trilogy. And I'm glad to finally have the products of that more inventive filmmaker released on DVD, even if the transfers are so indifferent.    A couple of additional thoughts (and why not, considering that Lucas had so many when preparing the \\"special editions\\" of the original trilogy!): It seems to me that the longtime fans who wanted a better transfer aren't  crybabies who are never satisified; they simply want the original theatrical cuts to get the same treatment on DVD as other classic movies have. For example, \\"The Searchers\\"--one of the movies that influenced Lucas--looks downright spiffy in its newest transfer from the original VistaVision, but fans of that classic don't have to put up with dozens of wild horses digitally added to the background in order to get the best-looking DVD version. Second, I have to correct the reviewers who insist that Disc 2 is missing scenes included in the  original theatrical release. Sorry folks, Han did not confront Jabba in human form (that was an outtake which has appeared in making-of documentaries over the years, but not in the actual movie--and why would it? The actor who spoke Jabba's lines was never intended to be seen), and any extended scenes between Luke and his friend Biggs were cut before the movie was ever distributed to theatres. This is the 121-minute theatrical version as it was originally released on May 25, 1977, albeit a little grainy and washed-out compared to what I first saw in 70mm on a 62-foot screen 30 years ago.
B000002UAX|5.0|Having created the definitive concept album with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" the Beatles took the opposite approach on this scattershot '68 double LP. One can criticize \\"The White Album\\" for having no unifying theme, or one can enjoy it as a study in contrasts.<br /><br />Sun-drenched folk rubs elbows with baroque harpsichord pop. An avant-garde sound collage is sandwiched between a fairy tale and a lullaby. Stoned decadence meets Tin Pan Alley innocence. The Beatles genre-hop all over the place, and the results range from merely good to mind-blowingly great.<br /><br />\\"The White Album\\" is like a crazy mix tape compiled by four of your coolest friends. It set the stage for future cut-up classics such as Blondie's \\"Autoamerican,\\" Beck's \\"Midnite Vultures,\\" and Gwen Stefani's \\"L.A.M.B.\\" As with the other classic Beatles albums, it's a timeless triumph.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon set out to make a TV show like a movie, and succeeded. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled. Who knows why this flopped...guess we needed more lameass reality TV. The cast is amazing, the stories are well-written, and the characters are very interesting. The crew is a very diverse group that survive through many exciting adventures. The captain's haircut, clothing, and general philosohy are way too much like han solo...yet this us pulled off rather smoothly. The captn isn't half the selfish jerk that solo was.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|There's a saying: \\"No one sets out to make a bad movie.\\"  BROTHERS GRIMM (Miramax) might prove otherwise.  Near the beginning of his commentary, the usually brilliant Terry Gilliam actually says, \\"I didn't like the script, but I was out of work.\\"  Not a good sign but an honest admission from the former Python.<br /><br />Although wonderfully visualized, the Czech locations can't make-up for the muddled mess of a screenplay culled from perhaps the richest mother lode of raw story material available anywhere: The collected fairy tales of Wilhem and Jacob Grimm.<br /><br />In spite of stars Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as con artist exorcists who encounter real evil, a great poster and an OK trailer, audiences rightfully stayed away via quick word of mouth (\\"incomprehensible\\" \\"unwatchable\\"). Worthy extras of interest mainly to budding filmmakers are Gilliam's commentary and the featurette: \\"The Visual Magic of the Brothers Grimm.\\"
0066620996|5.0|The concepts developed in this book are as good for individuals as for corporations. I found the hedgehog concept particularly interesting. Hedgehog concept helps a company determine its forte. The same concept can be used by individuals to figure out what they want to do in lives? How can they be successful in what they are doing and importance of faith and long term planning. I would recommend this book to EVERYONE who wants to make a difference in his or her life. <br /> <br />The language used is plain and easy to understand even for someone whose english is not very good. The best part about the book is Author's use of real life examples to illustrate his point. The book starts with few technical concepts which may led reader to assume that the book is for business honchos only. But the book requires absolutely no knowledge of business world and stock market. So please don't let the first few pages deter you from reading the book.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Ah, if only Dylan hadn't used tobacco, his voice would sound so much better and he wouldn't look like he's nearly 80! But I still liked his latest album - one of the best in years. Too bad he probably won't be around much longer to give more of his great music to us. It's apparent from Elton John's latest album that smoking trashed his voice, too. Smoke-free is the way to be. Too late for these guys, though. So sad.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|Anamorphic or not..  the cheezy cover art alone is enough to keep me far away. Star Wars deserves better than this cheap B-movie toss-up.<br /><br /> Allright George,  Listen up...  I want the 'Ultimate Geek Star Wars Boxset'.  With the ORIGINAL films all cleaned up and up to modern specs, (maybe with the missing Biggs scene (which they actually showed on tv once) now included in the first.. or as an extra scene - I know, I know, ..it was mostly talking that told more of the story & NO special effects. Painful I know. - Shut up, & Put it in there anyways!) & you can throw in whatever latest 'super-wooper-duper version' you've come up with as well (as I'm sure you'll have it no other way.) Toss in every special-feature/making of documentary ever made, (Hell, you can even toss in that godawful Chewbacca christmas special to torture the fans a bit more..)  throw that on it's own disc as well...  Toss in a little toy Yoda...  And for God's sake - put in some DECENT cover art this time! The original art on the individual boxes within (which I liked) & maybe another cool Vader-mask image on the outer box (make it a DECENT box - not too cheap this time!..  And VIOLA! All done.  Now that wasn't so bad was it?

B00004T9UF|4.0|I will admit I used to be a big Eminem fan. However, my tastes in music have evolved over the years, and now I don't even consider Em one of my favorite artists. But, I will still admit that Eminem knows how to rap and has some of the best flows rap has seen in it's short history. His first album dropped quietly (Infinite), and then when \\"My Name Is\\" off of his second album, \\"Slim Shady LP\\", blew up, Eminem became a household name. Then he dropped this album, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", and created even more controversy. With songs about killing his wife, being addicted to drugs, and an obsessive fan killing himself over Em not responding to his letters, this is definitely not an album for kids.<br /><br />After the intro, the album gets into \\"Kill You\\", which has a lot of controversial lyrics, mainly about killing women, but at the end he says that he's just playing and that he loves ladies. Then the next track, \\"Who Knew\\", has Eminem pretty much telling the truth. He raps about how people like to blame him for what their kids do, and he says that it's really hypocritical because that the parents should take more responsibility for their kids. He manages to get the message across very humorously, which makes for a pretty nice track. \\"Stan\\" is definitely one of the biggest highlights of Eminem's entire rap career. I love the emotion in the track, the storytelling, and the beat. Almost everything about the track is perfect. \\"The Way I Am\\" is another angry track that was a hit back quite a few years ago. \\"Marshall Mathers\\" is a track where Eminem just lets his feelings come out. He downs boy bands, rappers pretending to be Pac & Biggie, relatives that never wanted to see him till he was on TV, and he also disses the Insane Clown Posse. \\"Drug Ballad\\" is a hilarious track about being addicted to drugs. I like the beat and Em's flow is really good. \\"Kim\\" has to be a highlight for this album. It's definitely sick, but I love the raw emotion Eminem displays on this track. It vividly describes killing his wife, rapping as if he's talking to her. It's definitely not for everyone. But, I still love this track. \\"Under the Influence\\" has a good beat, \\"Amityville\\" has an awesome chorus and beat, and \\"Criminal\\" has a good intro with excellent lyrics.<br /><br />Many people say this is a classic, but I don't think so. For just a few reasons. \\"Remember Me\\", even though it has a good chorus, and a good appearance by Sticky Fingaz, I still can never get into this track. It always gets a skip from me. So does the next track, \\"I'm Back\\". It doesn't hold a candle to the other tracks on the album. The Ken Kaniff skit is pointless. \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" was ok for the first few listens, but then after it got played out it got really really fast. And it's not one of Em's best tracks either. \\"B***h Please II\\" also gets a skip for me. I think all of these tracks are weak compared to the other songs on here. So the album's not completely consistent.<br /><br />Eminem still managed to make a very solid album with the Marshall Mathers LP. He may have went downhill from here, but after this album there's no way anyone could say Em didn't have any talent. I just disagree with all these people calling this a classic. It has too many lackluster tracks to be considered a classic. However, it's still great and it shouldn't be looked over by any Hip-Hop fan at all. I do recommend this to anyone that likes sick music, good flows, or just rap in general. If you're sleeping on Eminem because of his gimmicky made for radio tracks, then you should really pick this up. Give him a chance and you'll realize he's one of the best MC's of the past 10 years. Atleast in my opinion..... It vividly describes killing his wife, rapping as if he's talking to her. It's definitely not for everyone.

B000I2IT44|5.0|I received an advance copy of this from PT distributer Burning Shed (#417 for those of you keeping count). This DVD is Porcupine Tree live at Chicago's Park West October 11-12, 2005.   The material list is:     Disc One   Revenant (opening theme music)   Open Car   Blackest Eyes   Lazarus   Hatesong   Dont Hate Me   Mother and Child Divided   Buying New Soul   So Called Friend   Arriving Somewhere but Not Here   Heartattack in a Layby   The Start of Something Beautiful   Halo   The Sound of Muzak   Even Less   Trains     Disc 2   Lazarus Video, Futile and Radioactive Toy from German TV Show Rockpalast, Drummer Gavin Harrison's Cymbal Song, the Movies that accompanied Halo, Start of Something... and Mother and Child Divided and Photo Gallery.     OK reviewing this, the short review is; get it, this is the best band out there right now and this DVD is a great representation of how good they are.    The longer version is, Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson alter their musical direction every couple of years (sort of the theme of the rarely played Buying New Soul) and this is where they were in 2005 and 2006. This is their first DVD and it perfectly captures what that 2005 Deadwing tour was. I happened to see the first show of this tour in Tampa and the DVD shows that they just became tighter and heavier as the tour went on.     The Deadwing Tour was heavier than the old psychadelic, progressive and song based material (yes its too bad there werent official DVDs for the previous phases of PT), but it is still great stuff. (as Steven sings on Arriving somewhere-- all my designs simplified, all of my plans compromised, all of my dreams sacrificed). While the music now may be slightly simplified, anyone would be hard pressed to say much has been sacrificed.     Some may question the inclusion of non-cd tracks such as Mother and Child Divided or So-Called Friend, but fans of the band either know these or get to know them quick and they fit the overall feel of the tour very well. Anytime you have as much great material as PT the song selection can be questioned, but this performance is so powerful I reccomend just sitting back and enjoying what there is rather than lamenting what there isnt.     The 5.1 audio on this release is better than any Ive heard (I also highly reccomend the DVD-A versions of Stupid Dream, In Absentia and Deadwing, if you want hear how good 5.1 DTS can sound, and make yourself slightly deaf without realizing you are doing it;-).     The video is nicely shot, lots of shifts of focus without being jarring, and the camera seems to be where you'd like it to be most of the time (a real flaw in tons of Live DVD's). Also, there are no cheesy effects or technological experiments which means this should stand the test of time (there is some shifting of black and white to color, but it is pretty unobtrusive, although Im used to a lot of vids from the 70s some of which have really bad effects).     Now let me add, this DVD isnt perfect, but the complaints are fairly minor. The thoughts I had after only a couple of watches... 1. On Open Car the vocals seem buried (may have been purposeful, but its a distraction. 2. The video never captures(and maybe couldnt)the size and integration of the films that accompanied the songs. 3. The packaging is nice, but its cardboard and vulnerable to fingerprints, dents, etc.      Also, don't think you are getting 2 discs of live music, Disc 1 is a full concert, Disc 2 is odds and ends. I wasnt sure why they didnt just include the entire Rockpalast show (if they could show 2 songs, why not the whole show?) My guess is because it was largely the same material, but fans wouldnt have minded.     Fans can argue for the different albums of PT being their best, but this really seems to a document of a great band at the top of their game. If all music was this thoughtful, composed and sincere, I would like a lot more music.     End thought, if you like PT at all, get this! If you are curious, get this! If you have friends that might like this; show them! People into this band know there really isnt a way to describe how close to perfect they are (only God knows why they arent HUGE, and I suspect he has questions)and this DVD is a great document of that circa 2005-06.
0375713751|4.0|This book is the best I've read with regard to describing the frustrations of being a working mother. Although my job (and probably the jobs of most of the readers of this book, or else they wouldn't have the time to be reading novels!!!) is nowhere near fast-paced, high-flying and competitive as Kate Reddy's, the feeling that you're on a constant treadmill set too fast is all too familiar.  <br />Allison Pearson tackles her subject with great honesty and a wonderful sense of humour and though I really enjoyed the book, I got a feeling that she kind of \\"sells out\\" the working mothers of the world in the end. Yes, I KNOW from bitter experience that we can't have it all, but does that mean we have to give up trying? <br />
B000F5Z6IG|5.0|New Aussie band Wolfmother are on the rise right now, with their retro hard-rock blend that is equal parts Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Maybe a bit of Deep Purple thrown in for good measure. With influences like that, this band has a lot to live up to.<br /><br />But in their self-titled debut album, Wolfmother proves that they are more than the sum of their influences. Their hard rock is murky, raw, and energetic, the sort of thing you can dance or mosh to, and their slower songs are still sharp and wild around the edges. This is definitely one for the fans of good rock'n'roll.<br /><br />It opens with an earsplitting yell, and if you're not expecting it, it's sure to make you sit up and listen. It's followed by a crunchy, murky mass of hard rock with an otherworldly edge. After getting lost in the desert, \\"I had to write something down/And I found myself alone, and then I let go of everything/Into another DI-MEN-SION!\\" frontman Andrew Stockdale hollers.<br /><br />Things steady out in the songs that follow, with Wolfmother exploring different kinds of hard rock. Yes, every kind I can think of. They dip into everything from steady bass grinds to hard psychedelica to catchy fuzz. And as they explore different sounds and styles, they manage to keep the same rough, wild edge in every song.<br /><br />Wolfmother even dabble in quieter music in \\"Mind's Eye,\\" a panoramic rock number with stretches of quiet, almost pretty music, and the closer almost sounds like a folk song at times. This band is in great form in these songs, which show the complexity of their music, but it sounds like the musicians are barely restraining themselves.<br /><br />There's something almost larger-than-life about Wolfmother's sound, with their wild lyrics and wilder musical skills. That quality is the sign of a really good rock band. They have energy, they have skill, and while their skill leans on that whole Zeppelin/Sabbath sound, they sound fresh.<br /><br />They also sound loud. These guys sound like they're testing the waters at times, which is the one drawback of \\"Wolfmother.\\" But even in their weaker moments, they show that they have musical expertise in murky bass, sizzling guitar, and some wicked percussion.<br /><br />Stockdale's voice is one that takes getting used to. At first he sounds thin and a bit nasal, and his vocalizing is kind of melodramatic. But as the album goes on, his voice will start to grow on you. He can really belt out those songs (\\"WITCH... CRAAAFT!\\"), but he can also sing in a more restrained manner. \\"If you listen to the sound within your mind/you may find the answer glowing in the tide...\\"<br /><br />In their rough, raw debut albun, Wolfmother demonstrates that it deserves all the attention it's getting in the rock press.

B00005JOYM|5.0|I live just a little over a mile from where the World Trade Center used to be, and I'll never forget that day five years ago, when the world watched its destruction.  There's finally some new construction going on in the area now and I could actually see it from the window of the theater where I chose to view this film.  It was a welcome contrast to the horror depicted on the screen, and the horror all of us lived with daily during that time.  I consider myself lucky that none of my loved ones were in those buildings that day.  Other fellow New Yorkers were not as fortunate.<br /><br />Of course I knew the plot of this Oliver Stone film.  I knew that the two Port Authority police officers who were trapped in the rubble were eventually rescued.  Later, we were reminded that only 20 people were rescued alive from the rubble.  I should have remembered that because I, like many others, volunteered to give blood.  We were all turned away though.  There were not enough survivors who could use it.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena are cast as the two cops.  Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal are their wives.  The acting was excellent and they all must have had a great dialogue coach because their New York accents sounded authentic.  During much of the film, we feel the claustrophobia of being trapped along with the men.  They are pinned under debris, terribly hurt, and yet they keep themselves alive by talking to each other.  There are also some flashbacks about their families as well as a current running timeline as their families learn of the disaster and wait for news.  The film captures the time and the place perfectly.  I was a bit unprepared by my own emotional reaction to the film though; I found myself weeping during much of it, not only for the two men trapped inside the buildings, but weeping for the disappointment of the last five years.  Even though life here has returned to normal, our world has become a much more dangerous place.<br /><br />After viewing film I walked around the area.  It's bustling and beautiful.  The World Financial Center has been restored to its former splendor and the riverfront is full of joggers and bicyclists.  There's a trapeze school and a batting range and attractive landscaping throughout the area.  And there's new construction which promises even more attractive piers and walkways.  Whenever I'm down in that area though, the one thing that always dominates my consciousness is the Statue of Liberty off in the distance.  It's still there.fter viewing film I walked around the area.  It's bustling and beautiful.

B000002UJQ|5.0|My college roommate played this cd relentlessly when it first came out & it won me over. More than one listen is probably a requirement in order to fall for this album. Its definitley out there. Apparently the lyrics are about the way machines dehumanize people but I loved to listen to the music even before I could understand what the heck the lyrics were saying. <br /> <br />I would say if you like, U2, Depeche Mode, and Coldplay there is a good chance you'll like OK Computer. My favorite tracks are Let Down with its engaging melody & the emotion it evokes, No Surprises with its dreamy but disturbing quality, and Lucky with its soaring vocals. However, I usually listen to this album from beginning to end. Its great to listen to when you're in a contemplative mood.  <br /> <br />It seems that people either love this album or hate it. You'll totally get it or you won't. I highly recommend that you give it a try! OK Computer is one of my all time favorites & Radiohead is truly talented.
0060833459|4.0|many bright ideas in the book had been further developed, elaborated and marketed.<br /><br />To me, the author is the topmost management guru ever. His ideas in this 1966 book, say, \\"First Thing First\\" (now seemingly to be originated from Stephen Covey, what a shame), time management through task prioritization, systematization of the decision making process, being effective by getting the right things done etc etc simply form the skeleton of contemporary self/business management thoughts. However, I had rated it with four star for two reasons. First, the great concepts put forth by the author were just too good to be put in one single 174 page book. He could elaborate further on any one of them. Second, the examples adopted in the revised version were still those historical cases near the WWI, the WWII and the Vietnamese War era. Some may like that but I find them too remote and aged to relate to.<br /><br />Afterall, it's still a very good book for any executive (somebody expected to get the right things done, per the author) or executive to be.

The kind that made me feel as if I had been zoned out all day until I heard the song and suddenly I felt alive! OK, maybe thats a bit dramatic, but you get the picture. I fell in love with the song, and even now 10 years later I still get swept up in the emotion of the song. <br /> <br />Beautiful vocals, arrangements and lyrics continue throughout every song of this album although none of the other tracks effected me as forcefully as Bittersweet Symphony. My other favorites are Lucky Man, Sonnet, and The Drugs Don't Work. <br /> <br />Still relevant-- buy it if you somehow missed this one.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have my rugs and wood floors vacuumed once per week. I bought Swivel Sweeper to keep the dark green rug in our dining room free of lint, pet fluff, and crumbs the easily make the rug look unkept. These particals stay on the top of the rug and are easy to sweep up with a brush.  That is all Swivel Sweeper is, moving brushes.  It is not a vacuum cleaner. It is only a powered floor sweeper.  I have had several other sweepers.  This one gets high marks because it removes all the surface particals and is very easy to maneuver.  It's the only sweeper I've owned that does not require moving the dining chairs to get all spaces clean.  Suggest you do as I did and buy an extra battery. That way one is always ready to go.  The batteries have given me no trouble because I remove them from the charger after 24 hours and just rotate to the sweeper.  I use the sweeper twice a day. It runs about five minutes each time. After each cleaning, I pop out the dirt tray and empty.  This is important for effective operation and takes only 30 seconds to do. I bought a second Swivel Sweeper as a gift for my syster, complete with a second battery.  She reports back giving high marks and loves the sweeper.  My family has named ours \\"squirrel-lee\\" and the kids even like to use it. I have not had problems with the unit, but don't expect it to replace your main vacumm cleaner.  It's just for \\"touch up\\" cleaning.  It also does a good job on my kitchen floor. Most effective getting into corners and edges.  I think it's a good unit. Thanks . . . ~SWD -- Beverly Hills, Florida
B00005AXEL|5.0|I haven't been able to listen to one of Stevie's albums all the way through since 1985's Rock a Little. That changed for me with Trouble In Shangri-La. Stevie seems at ease with her now gravelly voice and uses it to add character and strength to the songs. I guess before I heard Trouble I had never really gotten over the soaring, pure voice of Stevie back when Rhiannon and Dreams were the big hits on the radio. Now Stevie has taken charge of her forever altered voice & used it to her best advantage. <br /> <br />Favorite tracks... <br /> <br /> <br />LOVE IS... Probably my favorite of the bunch. Stevie sings of lost love as only she can. Changing between first, second and third person, past and present tense, the song seems to be more about the experience of love over a lifetime rather than just one love affair. Sarah McLachlan adds to the mystical quality of the song with her etherial voice. A hauntingly beautiful song.  <br /> <br />EVERYDAY...A simple but heart felt song. Stevie's voice is beautiful on the chorus. <br /> <br />BOMBAY SAPPHIRES...Has a latin flavor with a prominent accoustic guitar lead. Nice upbeat song with a catchy chorus. <br /> <br />CANDLEBRIGHT...Stevie's voice is showcased nicely in this well produced song. Sheryl Crow harmonizes at parts to add more layers. Another song where Stevie talks about who she is--no apologies. I love the ending. You can really hear the beautiful background vocals of the ever faithful Sharon Celani and Lori Nicks. <br /> <br />All the tracks are great however, and I recommend sitting back, relaxing and listening to the whole album beginning to end if you have the time. I have owned this album since it was released in 2001 and have continued to listen without tiring of the songs. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000GFLE1S|4.0|Even if these boots aren't exactly made for walking, they do look stylish. Charlie Price (Joel Edgerton) must take over the family shoe business when his father dies. He discovers that the company is failing badly. He finds salvation of sorts when he meets drag queen and cabaret singer Lola (Chiwetel Ejiofor from \\"Serenity\\" proving his versatility in this role). Lola complains about how the footwear she wears is so poorly designed. Lauren (Sarah-Jane Potts) a former employee has a brainstorm--goes into men's fetish footwear. In other words, women's shoes that men (whether they be drag queens or not) can wear. Suddenly Charles has a niche market to work with and success comes unexpectedly comes knocking at his door. Unfortunately Charles must deal with his fianc&eacute;'s (Jemima Rooper) disapproving attitude and the prejudice of his own employees before success can be fully his.<br /><br />An amusing and poignant film that has just the right mix of drama in it, \\"Kinky Boots\\" was inspired by a true story. The performances are uniformly excellent throughout with a star making turn from actor Chiwetel Ejiofor as the transvestite Lola. He's not exactly a beautiful transvestite but quite convincing in the role.<br /><br /> With a transfer that has the sheen and texture of leather \\"Kinky Boots\\" looks quite good with minimal digital artifacts. Although some of the darker scenes don't have quite as much detail as they should the overall look of the film in this transfer is quite good with accurate color, skin tones and detail. The 5.1 mix sounds good but most of the action and dialogue (not surprisingly) occurs in the center speaker and two front ones.<br /><br />We get an observant and fact filled commentary track from director Julian Jarrold, stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Joel Edgerton and Sarah-Jane Potts. Their commentary track was done all at the same time so there's a nice dynamic between the actors and director that keeps the commentary moving along. Although it does occasionally focus on the obvious (nice performance here, etc.) there are nice tidbits of trivia about the production of the film.<br /><br />\\"The Real Kinky Boots Factory\\" featurette focuses on the inspiration for the film in the UK. Producer Nick Barton discusses how they saw a documentary on a family business that was struggling against inexpensive imports and how they found their niche with the cross dressing market. Steve Pateman the current factory owner provides the background on the story and we see quite a bit of their actual product as well as hearing from the actors about how their research influenced the fictional story on screen.<br /><br />\\"The Journey of a Brogue\\" provides a visual montage of the production of the shoes. It's brief but an interesting glimpse into the detail. A pity that it's not longer with comments from actual shoe producers as there is a great story behind the production of shoes and the struggle against inexpensive imports that some manufacturers have waged.<br /><br />We also get four deleted scenes with commentary by director Jarrold. The deleted scenes are primarily character bits where for example Lola bonds with the women and men who work on the shoe production or Charlie reminisces with Lauren and discusses the changes to the factory production. Jarrold points out that while the scenes are quite good they effected the pacing of the film and were cut for that reason. \\"The Prettiest Star\\" features Lola remembering his childhood and obsession with women's footwear walking along the pier to Bowie's \\"The Prettiest Star\\".<br /><br />An amusing character comedy \\"Kinky Boots\\" features stellar performances from a strong cast. It's a funny, affecting film with just the right mix of poignant drama and comedy that the British are so adept at doing.asionally focus on the obvious (nice performance here, etc.) there are nice tidbits of trivia about the production of the film. <br /> <br />\\"The Real Kinky Boots Factory\\" featurette focuses on the inspiration for the film in the UK.

B000H0MKOC|4.0|Nick Taylor (Aaron Eckart)makes his living by using smoke and mirrors to sell the following concepts-Smoking. It's evil. It kills. Everything kills. It's not smoking that kills. It's people killing people by making the choice to smoke. It's all about choices. Your choice, my choice everyone's choice smoking is a choice just like driving, deciding to get out of bed and having a mammogram. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) makes a living using this type of logic (and debating with little girls among others) and justifying the existence and use of cigarettes by everyone. He's a lobbyist. He's there to argue that common sense and decency are malleable. He works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies where most of the studies about smoking goes on. That's like letting companies dictate the studies that should be done about their medication; they'll always design the studies to the best effect for the company. Nick uses the same arguments that Captains of Industry use to excuse gouging you for gas, medicine and any other essentials in life. Naylor and his friends (The MOD Squad or merchants of death) justify their existence by protecting the corporations of the world via spin. The spin suddenly changes when he becomes more than hated but a target and has to examine his core values.<br /><br />Brilliantly acted, scripted and directed by Jason Reitman the film brilliantly captures Christopher Buckley's book without being too literal. \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" features perfect casting as well. Aaron Eckhart is probably our most underrated actor. He's brilliant at playing confident and conflicted equally well.<br /><br />It's a marvelous film.<br /><br />Some of the special features are cooler than what you'll find in a carton of Kool; We get a feature length commentary one with Jason Reitman solo and a second with the director and actors Aaron Eckhart and David Koechner. There are also deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reitman. \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\" episode featuring Buckley, producer David Sax, Aaron Eckhart and director Reit man discussing the challenges of translating Buckley's novel to the screen also appears.<br /><br />\\"Unfiltered Comedy\\" is a making of featurette with the standard clips and talking heads but it's the comments that make it worthwhile to watch. \\"America: Living in Spin\\" features plenty of clips from the film along with cast and crew discussing the world of spin that we live in where everything bad can be good. We also get a trio of galleries including poster art, behind-the-scenes stills and a storyboard which focuses on the first 15 minutes of the film. From the storyboard it looks to me like they were originally aiming for Oprah for the talk show. We wind things up with the theatrical trailer and a promo spot for the inspired soundtrack.<br /><br /> A very funny book gets a very funny cinematic translation to the screen. I had hesitation going into this only because I felt that Reitman might ruin it because while it may be his eighth film as director it's the first major feature film that he's done.ron Eckhart and director Reit man discussing the challenges of translating Buckley's novel to the screen also appears.      \\"Unfiltered Comedy\\" is a making of featurette with the standard clips and talking heads but it's the comments that make it worthwhile to watch. \\"America: Living in Spin\\" features plenty of clips from the film along with cast and crew discussing the world of spin that we live in where everything bad can be good.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|Wow, I am really impressed with this album. I didn't have the highest of expectations for it but bought it anyway because it's Maiden. But I think that this is their best album since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. That means it's their best album in 18 years! For those who don't know, that makes it better than No Prayer for the Dying, Fear of the Dark, The X Factor, Virtual XI, Brave New World and Dance of Death.  <br /> <br />This album has quite a few long epic songs that Maiden are famous for. Some previous such songs include Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Hallowed be they Name, Phantom of the opera etc. Some of the highlights on this CD include: These Colours Don't Run, Brighter Than a Thousand Suns and For the Greater Good of God.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album for any Maiden fan. If you like any of Maiden's previous albums, you will almost certainly like this though I can't promise that you'll love it. It does have some duds but they are overshadowed by the good songs. If you are new to Maiden, I wouldn't recommend starting with this album. Start with Powerslave or their self titled debut Iron Maiden.  <br /> <br />As for the Maiden haters, don't listen to them. People are complaining that the songs are too long? When is the last time that you thought that a good song is too long? I'm usually dissapointed at how short some songs are. You won't have that problem with this album. If you get sick of a song, just hit the next button! This is so much more complex, intelligent and interesting than anything that you will hear on popular radio these days. If you want unsophisticated rock with 3 minute songs, don't bother buying this album.  <br /> <br />Enough said. Up the Irons! They never cease to amaze me.
B000002868|4.0|This album starts from where Miles left off.  It's fusion before fusion wasn't cool.
B000060MWU|5.0|This movie is probably the best I have seen in my life. The plot is obscure as hell, until you figure out what the movie is about, then it all seem extremely obvious. The only point I want to make is that the movie does make sense, and the story line is actually very simple, but it doesnt jump at you just from watching the movie, you have to think about it and see it again and again. Anyway, this is a great movie, watch it and let it flow, you will enjoy it. Then think about what it means and watch it again and again.
0679411585|4.0|As a non-American living in the US for a year, I bought this book to learn more about the Vietnam war.  It didn't really serve its purpose in this respect - and that was my fault - but it more than made up for it by being one of the best war books I've ever read.  This stands easily alongside anything Stephen Ambrose ever wrote.  The authenticity is one hundred per cent because these authors were there - their passion, emotion and commitment to their mean comes screaming through the pages.  As does their frustration with military top brass and politicians.  I'll never forget finishing the book on a Sunday morning, sitting up in bed, tears streaming down my face as I read of the impact of the deaths of those brave men who perished.  The consequences hit generation after generation.  This book is essential reading now because it highlights the futility of war and the no-win situation that America repeatedly puts itself into.
0792846443|5.0|Misery by Stephen King- WOW, thats all I'm going to say. Both Cann and Bates exectute their roles in this film flawlessly. Misery Chastain will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish, I promise you. <br /> <br />The film starts off with Paul Sheldon cruisin' in his mustang after just finishing his manuscript for a new book. But he doesn't stay happy for too long, as a nasty blizzard moves in and causes his mustang sally to topple down a Colorado mountain. <br /> <br />Paul has no fear though, cause Annie Wilkes is right nearby to save him (we later find out she was following Paul). It is once Annie gets Paul settled in her country Colorado home that the terror begins!!! King reels viewers in slowly, but not long after Paul is hoping to recover we realize what Annie's true intentions are.........don't rent; BUY IT!! ITS THAT GOOD! <br />
0385751060|5.0|I purchased and read this book while on a tour of Ireland last June.  The Irish author, like many of his countrymen, is an accomplished and fascinating storyteller.  I loved the way it was written from the innocent point of view of a nine year old, and highly recommend this book to young adults and adults alike.  I'm glad to see that it is finally available in the U.S.
B000001E18|5.0|To the best of my knowledge, Zooropa was never intended to be a full album, but rather an EP that turned into a full album.  Listening to U2's albums before and after, it's a pretty good guess as to why.  This was U2 being U2, showing they can do whatever they want and doing so by creating an eclectic, infectious blend of electronics and a faint sound of rock n' roll.  To futher confuse audiences, besides the lead track's ode/warning of commericial culture and a couple of love songs, the songs on this album are just plain weird - and that's what's so wondeful about it. <br /> <br />Numb was the lead single, featuring the Edge in monotone delivering a list of dont's with Bono providing incidental harmonies.  All this done with interesting electronic sounds that have Eno written all over them.  Hardly single material, but nonetheless engaging - and it produced one of the most iconic videos in U2's career. <br /> <br />Stay was the closest to standard U2, though the inspiration was a Wim Wenders film that was heavily featured in the song's video.  Lemon, featuring Bono singing higher than ever before is a grand song, mixing strings with dance.  These odd takes are just the singles.  The meat of the album has even more to offer. <br /> <br />The two other standouts include Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car, and The Wanderer.  The former is a mix of loops and samples with a lyrical cry for independence while the latter shows that Bono saw Johnny Cash as a hip alternative icon a year before the American Recordings series took off. <br /> <br />What makes this album so special though is that it's a risk taking album.  Finished on the heels of the highly successful Achtung Baby, Zooropa should have promised to be a straight rock n' roll record, but it was something far different.  While it doesn't have the post-punk excitement of U2's early records or the straight laced rock n roll of their later ones, it's U2 doing a record that is all them.  The album is at times crass, and sarcastic, while the production courtesy of flood and Eno, as before, is sharp.  Definitely one of the highlights of U2's post 80s career.
B000FILW86|5.0|If, like me, you had lost track of Cheap Trick over the years, THIS is the reason to come back and discover what a GREAT band they are!!! There are NO duds on this album. Each track is a prime example of power pop and good rocking at it's finest!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  I typically listen to newer indie type rock and that's why it surprises me so much that looking back on 2005, this is easily my favorite album of the year.  Most albums tend to lose their luster after a year or so, but not Playing the Angel.  I still listen to part of it practically every day or so.  The best part about this album is how different tracks will grow on you.  At first my favorite track was \\"A Pain that I'm Used To\\" and my least favorite track was \\"John the Revelator\\".  Now I'd consider \\"John the Revelator\\" tied with \\"Precious\\" for the best track.  However, the entire album is incredibly good with no big weak points.  My only complaint is that the first few tracks have so much energy, but that the energy seems to fade in the second half of the album.
B000ANVQ0K|2.0|How could Mr. Cameron take a subject like this and a cast and bring out the worst in everybody?<br /><br />The production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuous, but the script and dialogue are so banal, the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another. (Including Leo, who was so good in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" in 1993 when I didn't yet know who he was, I thought he was really a cute little retarded kid... yet in \\"Titanic\\", there's just nothing there--- or nothing permitted).<br /><br />Talk about a SHIP wreck!!<br /><br />Only the two studio-backed block voting resulted in the record-tying Oscar wins/nominations.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I have been DYING for this to come out ever since Beauty and the Beast had its special release!!  The music has been some of my all-time favorite Disney music, and this is the first movie that I remember seeing in theatres.  I was three years old.  Needless to say, it had a MAJOR impact on my life.  Anyone who loves classic Disney should purchase this special edition and watch it over and over again like you've never seen it before!  I can't wait for this to be released!!
B00005JOVH|3.0|Is that a promise?<br /><br />Fans of the comic series, beware! This movie is absolutely non-canonical...even more so than the first two films. Though an entertaining film for those who are not familiar with the comic book roots (or even the cartoon series), a real disappointment for long-time fans. A decent action film nonetheless.
B000FVGMC4|5.0|I haven't been so excited to get a CD in years.  I'll warn you ahead of time - these songs will be stuck in your head... you won't be able to stop singing them silently.<br /><br />This guy is refreshing - in that I haven't heard anything NEW or DIFFERENT in years.  Whether you're my age, or the age of my daughters (early 20's), you'll find this music addictive.  When I first heard Paolo on the Craig Ferguson show, I was hooked.  When sharing with my daughters they said, \\"Mom found really cool music\\".  (not the typical response I get)<br /><br />I'm in my 40's and some of these songs bring back those emotions from youth that life pushes far into your memory's recesses.  You won't believe that this singer/songwriter is just 19.<br /><br />This is the only review I've ever submitted - and I'm on Amazon daily.  He is just THAT good.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This FINAL film for the original crew was good. Director Nicholas Meyer did a great job with the characters and the plot was timeless and political at the same time. The Dvd has some interesting featurettes and insight behind Meyer's directing. Definetely better have this one in your collection!
B000G759LW|1.0|I love Christina's voice and her personality, yet, her CD is more than dissappointing, too many slow songs, the 1st single is the only catchy song on the CD. It has a couple of good slow songs...but buying a CD for 2 songs is a let down. Get Jessica Simpson's Public Affair, so much better.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|Superhero movies used to be the death knell for a studio. For the longest time Superman and Batman were the only heroes that were worth making a movie of or giving a television show to. Things started to change in the late 1970s with Wonder Woman and The Incredible Hulk being given their own shows. There were a few other superhero movies that were made, but it was incredibly expensive to do so in a way that would make a profit. But along came CGI and everything changed. Now, superhero movies aren't only saving the comic book industry, but they're also becoming a common staple as well as the tentpole franchises that studios build around.<br /><br />Lately a new angle has become prominent in superhero films, that of the superfamilies. Perhaps it was because of the mega-success of Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES, I'm not sure, but movies about superfamilies are the latest fad. Disney knows a good thing when they see it and cashed in on the fad early with SKY HIGH.<br /><br />SKY HIGH is basically the story about a boy growing up and going to high school and learning to come to grips with the man he is becoming. But the boy of this movie ain't no ordinary boy. His name is Will Stronghold and he's the son of the two biggest superheros on the planet (no, not Superman and Wonder Woman): The Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). Will gets to attend a special high school, Sky High. It's the place that all superhero kids go to train and develop their skills and powers. Will's dad hopes that Will has super-strength like himself while his mom would like to see him fly like herself, but is happy for him no matter what. That is a good thing because Will doesn't have any powers and ends up getting tracked into the side kick regiment of the school. Unbeknownst to everyone, though, an evil mastermind is planning revenge and Will is the key to taking over the world.<br /><br />SKY HIGH has a lot of clich&eacute;s and has a predictable plot. But, don't hold that against it. The film has an impressive cast of supporting actors, including Lynda Carter (she once played Wonder Woman) as Principal Powers and Bruce Campbell as Coach Boomer. Also, most of the main characters are teenagers that are portrayed by actual teenagers! That's something rare in a major motion picture (though Disney does a better job of that than any other studio in the business). The main actor's youth added some realism and grounded the film, despite it's farfetched and imaginative story.<br /><br />I wasn't expected to like SKY HIGH very much. I knew it was a Disney film and I was expecting it to be a cheap knock-off of THE INCREDIBLES. It's not a cheap knock-off of that film and surprisingly stands on it's on. The film even has some wit, e.g. in the character named Warren Peace. I laughed quite a bit and surprisingly found myself enjoying the film. As far as family-friendly, the movie doesn't have any major foul language or sex and the violence is of the cartoony-kind. Now, let's all go kick some bad guys' butt.lm has an impressive cast of supporting actors, including Lynda Carter (she once played Wonder Woman) as Principal Powers and Bruce Campbell as Coach Boomer.

B00005JMEW|5.0|This by all means is one of the best movies I have seen and just to think I considered ignoring it. My first reaction to the title was, \\"Man this must be some cheesy flick.\\" Boy was I wrong! Thanks to my cousin, I saw this and man oh man is this baby a classic. You have got to have a problem if you dont enjoy this story.
0141301120|2.0|After reading the delightful Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this sequel was an absolute let-down. The novel begins with the great Glass Elevator breaking through the ceiling of Charlie's (formerly Wonka's) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the Earth. While beyond the reaches of Earth's atmosphere, our heroes---Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Mr. Wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious Vermicious Knids (pronounced \\"K'Nids\\"), aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. Far worse than these beasties, though, are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless. Charlie, Joe, and Wonka, with no help from Charlie's folks or other grandparents, save themselves and a US spacecraft from the clutches of the Knids and return to the Chocolate Factory, where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills, returning them to infancy or beyond. Charlie and Wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites, who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters. At the end of the novel, the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the President.<br /><br />In short, these three are the most tedious, spiteful, unredeemable characters I've come across in children's literature and I hoped that they would be eaten by the Knids or the Gnoolies or even the Oompa-Loompas as I read this book. As it is, they (unlike the awful kids in the Chocolate Factory) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last. Their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore, rather than a joy, to read.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|This album is the pinnacle of the ELO sound.  And no other band has ever come close to blending classical music with rock and pop as perfectly as you'll find on this CD. <br /> <br />The remasters sound wonderful. The bonus tracks (several songs stripped down accoustically to fully expose the violins, cellos, ets.) reveal Jeff Lynne's and Louis Clark's arrangements to be even more amazing than when the world first heard this album back in the 70's.  With this, one of the best collections of music ever written, has gotten even better! <br /> <br />EXCEPT...Surrender.  This bonus track was supposed to be a long lost song from this era, re-recorded by Jeff Lynne exclusively for this remaster.  I find it very hard to believe.  This song has none of the same chords, lyric choices, movement, etc. than anything else he wrote during this phase of his career.  Surrender is far more like one of his \\"throw aways\\" that you'll find on either Secret Messages or Balance of Power.  It's not good enough for the more recent Zoom or his solo Armchair Theater.  I think we've been fooled on this one. <br /> <br />Buy the CD.  You will not regret the experience. <br /> <br />
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton's book sheds a great deal of light on the underlying mechanisms of the mind/body interface.  He draws from his background as a cellular biologist, and the research of others, to present an accessible and fascinating description of the response of cells (and life) to the emotional environment.... The writing is clear and enjoyable.... An inspiring book.....<br />Research in the field of hypnosis offers further insight and a look at the practical application of this knowledge.  If this is of interest to you consider two excellent books by Ernest Rossi; MIND-BODY THERAPY (with David Cheek Ob/Gyn) and THE PSYCHOBIOLOGY OF MIND-BODY HEALING.  These books are somewhat specific to hypnotherapy, but they also offer a great deal of interest to the general reader.
0440237688|5.0|So my second book in the Reading Newberry Books series and... wow! I read this book completely in one day so my thoughts are real fresh about the thing as a whole...<br /><br />I really liked this book and I ate it up but I still don't know what to feel about the ending. I, like many people, wanted to see the community affected by the memories and I wanted to have some sort-of better feeling about where Jonas ended up. He was so much a victim of his family and his community that I, in my most humane way, want to know that he ended up well. I don't want to spoil this for anyone who is thinking about reading it.<br /><br />I'm 31 years old and this is a book that will entertain and make anyone of any age just think. Not only the ramifications of Jonas' act but to go further back, the community itself. I knew what they were doing however I was still surprised. Especially Jonas' father. Other aspects of the community frightened me more. The hive mentality of the whole community. The fact that people are born from mothers that they will never know. And I'm guessing that the \\"fathers\\" are just \\"sperm pops!\\" There are aspects of the community that remind me of socialism, then the Amish, then 1984 in the control of the community. There are aspects of the community that are good. I found myself thinking about that but as a writer, the suppression of art and individuality bothers me so much! And to not see color. I'm surprised Jonas didn't just go mad that he could see it and no one else but the Giver could!<br /><br />I really loved this book and it made me angry, happy, upset, and nervous which is what good fiction does and is what this community had no concept of. It's an interesting statement of the Mrs. Lowry's skills.
B000050XEI|2.0|For all her mystical etherial talent, this recorcing is all-American pop at its poorest...Cliche lyrics, choppy tempos, flat artistry. Perhaps she finds it novel to sing in english, but this cd is nothing like her earlier beautiful work...  If you're an original Enya fan, this isnt it.
074325144X|5.0|ChiRunning was the first running technique book I'd ever read. I found it because of a silly injury that wouldn't go away and the \\"injury free\\" on the cover dragged me in.<br /><br />Until then, I thought running was something that we did and didn't need any instruction on how to do it. I was dead wrong.<br /><br />Danny's approach will transform your running form, make running fun, and most of all keep you injury free while you're doing it.<br /><br />I've told many clients since being introduced to ChiRunning to pick up the book, read it front to back, and do every drill in it. Once they have they come back to me thrilled and ready to give in another shot even though their doctor has told them \\"never again.\\"<br /><br />The book will transform your running by allowing you to lighten up and use less force to propel you forward. Danny's approach is to let gravity work with you and lean into your run while you let your legs pick up then swing forward. When you get what he teaches it's almost effortless.<br /><br />This approach has allowed me to run longer distances and for longer periods of time without getting tired out of breath or injured. Sound good to you?!<br /><br />I introduced the technique to a client of mine who was suffering from some IT band tightness. We worked to stabilize her side-to-side hip swing (lateral) while she was running using some of the techniques and now the hip doesn't hold her back at all! It even allowed her to participate in her first triathlon, something she thought she could never do because of her injury!<br /><br />The book is a must have for those with knee, hip, and lower back troubles as well. Try it for a few weeks and you'll be surprised at how good it feels!<br /><br />It's a must read for all my clients, so it should be for you too!<br /><br />Kevin Gianni, NCSF-CPT<br /><br />Author and Personal Trainer

B0002234LS|2.0|I notice that most of the Amazon reviews of Secret Window have been written by fans of Johnny Depp, and that fact probably accounts for the higher than deserved ratings given to the film. While I have nothing against Depp, and actually think he's pretty good value, his emotional range is fairly limited. He does quirky very well, and funny also pretty well. And that's about it. I can't remember the last role he played where he was forced to connect emotionally with another character - he almost invariably plays the loner. I'm quite prepared to be proved wrong about this, as I'm by no means a Depp afficionado. But the films I have seen him in - Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Pirates of the Caribbean, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Blow - pretty much all fit into this category. <br /> <br />Having said that, Secret Window does not provide Depp with much of a chance to show his range, as it is about as subtle and enlightening as something neither subtle nor enlightening. Depp plays Mort Rainey, a successful author who has holed up in a cabin in the sleepy town of Tachmore Lake after a bitter separation and ongoing divorce from his wife Amy (played by Maria Bello). One morning he is confronted by a sinister redneck, John Shooter (John Turturro), who accuses Rainey of stealing his story and publishing it under another name - the \\"Secret Window\\" of the film's title. Rainey attempts to prove that this allegation is untrue, but predictably finds himself unable to do so, as things start to go disastrously wrong. Turturro's performance exudes malice, while Bello is fine as the emotionally confused ex-wife. Depp though, seems miscast. He portrays surface panic adequately, but genuine fear and paranoia are beyond him. However, I'm not sure any lead actor cast in this role could save what is a cliched and obvious thriller that provides very few thrills. The direction (by David Koepp) is fairly leaden, and, as others have already stated, the twist is both ludicrous and horribly telegraphed. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005AQF7|5.0|This album is a milestone when it comes to gangsta rap records. Snoop's laidback, smooth flow sounds like one with the g-funk production. Highly recommended especially those who hate on Snoop now-a-days. Snoop was in his prime and this LP is nothing less than perfect. Quality Rap Music from one of its pioneers!
B00005JNEW|5.0|Friday Night Lights more than lives up to its billing as the best sports film ever. Based loosely on a true story, the movie tells the story of a small-town high school football team, as they follow their dream of winning the state championship. <br /> <br />The acting is top-notch, the football sequences are action-packed, and the emotive punch is undiminished from the poweful, moving book. <br /> <br />This DVD belongs in any serious sports fan's library, and even non-sports fans will find it engaging and satisfying. Well worth its modest price. Five stars!
0553213105|5.0|This book is written during my favorite time period. . . It goes well with some other favorites like Dickens' works and Les Miserables. . . Well written with deep characters and funny portrayals of human nature (ie. Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine De Bourgh)  I simply loved the book and also the A&E film which is mostly simply quoted from the book!
B000A88EV4|5.0|The greatest movie that many Americans have never heard of, \\"Naked\\" won best director and actor at Cannes in 1993.  The action revolves around Johnny, played by David Thewlis, who rampages across the London night in a series of encounters in which he uses, abuses, and hurls vitriolic scorn laced with brilliant humor.  Everyone Johnny meets is twisted in some way, and the effect is only heightened by the couple of seemingly sane people the film offers, amongst them Johnny's original love interest played by Lesley Sharp.<br /><br />In one scene Johnny is admitted into an empty office building watched over by a security guard, and rages aloud his dark world-view that includes both time and space, and the illusion of the present, \\"But you're not in it now; you're not in it now,\\" because the future is constantly kicking the present in the behind.  He is as merciless to a tourettic stutterer as he is ultimately to himself, and Johnny pushes to the very brink of madness in a film that uniquely captures the razor-thin divide between genius and savagery.<br /><br />From a brutal landlord's wonderfully mangled French to another superb performance by Katrin Cartlidge, \\"Naked\\" stands testament to the sheer raw power and insight that occasionally graces our screens.
0790729644|5.0|I think this is one of the best westerns ever made, despite being a very atypical western. In most movies, the west was over-romanticized and idealized; here it's an unglamorous and almost film noir version of a western as several over the hill and cynical gunfighters, along with a rash, unproven, young wannabe, try to bring several evil-doers to justice. Each has his own reasons for taking part in this quest, despite the misgivings of Eastwood's and Freeman's characters. Both Freeman and Eastwood turn in a couple of their best performances, with Eastwood ironically turning in one that is 180 degrees apart from the macho role in the famous spaghetti westerns that originally made his name in the genre. Overall a fine western and one that should stand the test of time.
B000H305U0|4.0|I went out and grabbed this the first day it came out.  I expected this to be more like the first.  I like it but the first one was sooo much better. The album does offer some bangin hits though like \\"My Love\\" and \\"What comes around\\".
B0002KVULG|4.0|Remember being impressed with this film when it debuted, however its 79 release put it (just barely)in an earlier era of mainly straightforward, by-the-numbers scripts with no surprises. The bonus feature interviews of Langella and director Badham are very interesting. One of them has the opinion that George Hamilton's \\"Love at First Bite\\" Dracula spoof, which came out earlier in the summer of 79, hurt this <br />film. <br />This movie does a good job of projecting the proper atmosphere, it just doesn't seem as good as it did in 79.
B000002TQV|5.0|It's extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly where/how Radiohead were able to transform themselves into one of the most influential alternative rock bands of the 90's with songs that `hook' one in after a few careful and detailed listens. Their stuff is certainly powerful, sheerly brilliant and beyond beautiful, though occasionally a little odd (as in different) but very arty - which is a good thing in my book. The transformation probably began somewhere between ` My Iron Lung EP' and `The Bends', to safely say the least. They're not an easy band to `get into' but once you do get into them you will be captivated by their utter uniqueness and confidence in the music they make. And they're the kind of band that are willing to take risks. My introduction to the band came when I picked up `OK Computer' (the best music purchase of my life) in my local music store. It is indeed my favorite Radiohead album but believe me `The Bends' always comes a close second - sometimes I even prefer it to `OK Computer.' SOMETIMES. I can never really make up my mind now. Not taking the punk rock/grunge approach, as they did with their debut album, `Pablo Honey' (which was of mediocre quality, but the song `Creep' was a standout as a proclaimed self-loathing anthem), the songs in this album [The Bends] seem much more personal and therefore much more touching (`Fake Plastic Trees' is a simple yet beautiful song - one of the best). Frankly, I love pre-Kid A Radiohead so much better than post-Kid A because they weren't in their experimental stages but still gave it all their best and managed to release their follow-up masterpiece, `OK Computer' and finally they were hailed as the best new thing in rock. Something well deserved. `Just (Do It To Yourself)' is a strong, spunky and guitar driven song and the video (in horrific fashion) is just as good. `High & Dry' is a haunting ballad and my second favorite song in the album as Street Spirit (Fade Out) is my first. Though it usually varies. `OKComputer' is to a greater extent - a very complex, complicated, and obscure album, but if you are a first timer to Radiohead's music `The Bends' is the best album to start off with as it's their essential basis.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|After a four year hiatus since the release of their last cd 'A Funk Odyssey', Jamiroquai is back and better than ever. With thirteen years and five hit records including 'Traveling Without Moving' and 'Synkronized'  under their belt, this is one band that understands the concept of \\"if it aint broke, don't fix it\\". <br />  <br />  With their latest effort 'Dynamite' a heavier, edgier Jamiroquai is brought to light. This album, though slightly more guitar oriented  (as heard on tracks 'Loveblind' and 'Black Devil Car') still manages to keep that funky flavor we all know and love. As is true with most great recordings of our time, this album is not necessarily a love at first play affair. Give it a couple of listens however and there will be no need to make extra space in your cd rack, as it will never leave your player.  <br /> <br />  The first track 'Feels Just Like It Should', slaps you with a groove so raunchy it'll curl your mothers hair. Although Jay Kay uses no \\"actual\\" profanity in his lyrics, the implied subject matter definitely keeps up with the trashy vibe set by the distorted bass and funky back beat drums.  <br /> <br />  For me though, the album really kicks into gear with the second song and coincidentally title track, 'Dynamite'. This along with songs such as 'Starchild', '(Don't) Give Hate A Chance' and 'Time Won't Wait', is where the band brings us back into familiar territory via a mixture of solid dance beats, funky bass lines, smooth, dynamic vocals and flirtatious melodies. This vintage disco/funk genre is definitely where the band is in their comfort zone, and where they seem to shine the brightest. <br /> <br />  An instant vibe is set in the song 'Seven Days In Sunny June' that makes you feel almost as if your listening to one of your own memories. The cool and breezy feel of this one sets an ideal backdrop to Jay Kay's tale of summer, friendship and unrequited love ( or lust maybe? ) This song is a prime example of a perfect marriage between words and music.  <br />  'World That He Wants' is a departure from Jay Kay's usual dilettantish approach to lyrical composition. This song conveys a strong and poignant message about the tragic state of affairs in the world and the man responsible for them. By using sparser instrumentation on this track Jamiroquai takes a detour from their normal \\"groove oriented\\" format placing more emphasis on  the lyrical content. <br />  <br />  All in all, the arrangements, musicianship and production value on this album are the same high quality we've come to expect from this band over the years. In my opinion this is their best work to date, (not to mention one of the best live shows I've seen in a long time). Do yourself a favor and add this amazing album to your cd collection.  <br /> <br />In summation 'Dynamite' is, well... DYNAMITE!!!  <br />
0679411585|5.0|Knowing some of the people involved with this true story and having met General Harold Moore and Joe Galloway a few years ago I felt a necessity to read the general's book \\"We Were Soldiers Once and Young.\\" They wanted the truth told so Americans could learn about one particular unit and the major battle they fought in 1965. <br /> <br />The names of the fallen soldiers of the 1/7 Cav are listed on Panel 3 East of The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. General Moore and Joe Galloway told their story well. <br /> <br />This is a MUST read book and then SEE the movie. Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions. I believe the film has shown what the IaDrang Valley battle was really like. BUT if you are a true history reader and movie fan and prefer seeing war movies--this is the one to read and then watch! You not only see the battle scenes but also learn some of the relationship between the men, their wives, and families. <br /> <br />My hat goes off to both General Moore and Joe Galloway for making sure their story was written and then turned into a great movie! <br />

B00005JLEJ|5.0|The mortally wounded Lord Shingen (Tatsuya Nakadai), engaged in strife with two opposing warlords for control of feudal Japan, commands that his death be kept a secret for three years in order to prevent both disarray among his clan and conquest by his enemies.  Upon his death, his kagemusha, or double (Nakadai again)--a lowly thief with a startling resemblance to the lord--takes over under the strict supervision of Shingen's closest associates.   <br /> <br />This visually striking film explores the extent to which a person's identity is constructed by others.  The double begins to impress those around him as he seems to grow into the role, even winning the devotion of Shingen's grandson.  The man and his social position become blurred until it becomes unclear which is the real person.  When the double is unceremoniously humiliated and ejected from the palace toward the end, I could almost imagine that the rage of those who pelted him with stones was also repressed anger against the real Lord Shingen.  When the double witnesses the tragic fate of the Takeda clan at the end of the film, it is as if the ghost of Shingen himself has appeared to witness the end of all his dreams.  A powerful, thought-provoking, and moving film.
0618551050|5.0|Fundamental physics has been exceedingly successful for over two centuries. The rapid advances in our understanding of natural laws in the first three quarters of the 20th century were just as breathtaking as those in microchips or hard drives in the last. But this progress came to a screeching halt 30 years ago. There has been no real progress since the establishment of the standard model.    To observers outside of the physics community, this fact is far from obvious. Theorists in fundamental physics continue to make announcements on new ideas and results. Books are written and TV shows are made to trumpet the progress in string theory. Many models based on string theory are taken and marketed as facts.    As years and decades go by and waves of string theory \\"predictions\\" are repeatedly superceded by new, incompatible ones, doubts begin to grow in the minds of knowledgeable outsiders. How can a \\"theory of everything\\" that completely describes an \\"elegant universe\\" keep contradicting itself on issues as basic as the dimensionality of spacetime? How can the string theorists be so sure of what happens at 10^19 GeV while being totally silent on the physics just beyond the standard model at 10^3 GeV? How can 30 years go by and nothing in particle physics theory is remotely Nobel-worthy? How can the two most important experimental results (non-zero neutrino masses and a positive cosmological constant) catch string theory by such surprise?    Inquiries regarding these and many other suspicious signs are stonewalled by string theorists. The person who raises the issue is inevitably called ignorant, stupid, malicious, anti-science or all of the above. There are just too many beautiful results in string theory to be explained by coincidence, we are told. String theory is just too vast and too deep for human to comprehend easily, they assure us. Trust us, they say, this is not a case of \\"it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it\\".    But they did not address any of the questions. Worse, the list of questions grows longer by the year. Is the universe a 4-dimensional brane floating in the extra dimensions or a glorious 10-(should it be 11 now?)dimensional spacetime with 6 of the dimensions curling up? Why 6 and not, say, 7? If there are countless numbers of ways to curl up the extra dimensions, does each way correspond to a string universe? All these universes cannot be real at the same time, can they?    As the string story gets stretched thinner and thinner, so is its credibility. After it became increasingly clear that string theory would never be capable of making any meaningful predictions, the final straw, for many objective observers, finally fell when a large faction of string community pushed for the wholesale adoption of the Cosmic Anthropic Principle, an erstwhile anathema of modern science. String theory is too important, they claimed, to be bounded by conventional scientific principles, very much the same way in which Envon executives claimed their business to be too innovative to be understood with conventional accounting methods.    Just like the couragous independent analyst who started to question Enron's business practice a year before its ultimate collapse, Lee Smolin (along with Peter Woit) provides a stinging early indictment of the self-propelling enterprise that is string. You will find answers to or at least detailed descriptions of all the aforementioned questions and much more.     To me personally, the biggest surprise came when Smolin exposed the fraudulent proclamation of major achievements in string theory: the finiteness of its perturbative series, the S-duality, the AdS/CFT duality, the derivation of the classical general relativity equation and the computation of black hole entropy. Despite early misgiving about some shaky premises of string theory, I had nonetheless admired my string colleagues for their unparallelled breakthroughs. It turns out that these breakthroughs are nothing more than unproven hunches that somehow became the foundation and justification for decades of dominance over particle physics along with tens of thousands of self-congratulating publications. And you call this a theory more important than science itself? Shame on you!    After giving excellent diagnosis and prognosis on how sick fundamental theoretical physics has become, Smolin uses the final third of his book to prescribe a remedy. Here his arguments falter a bit. He advocates shifting emphasis away from calculation to philosophical deliberation, but with the exception of Einstein's General Relativity, physics has never achieved significant advance through abstract philosophical pursuit. The key to salvation from 30 years of wild goose chase lies in new experiments. Fortunately, the LHC will be operational soon and a new generation of physicists will have something real to work on. With some luck, string theorists will find themselves superceded by old fashion science within the next few years, and the readers of this book will understand why it is such a good riddance.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Making a single disc of Neil Young's biggest hits is not an easy task. Back in 1977, he released a two disc career retrospective called Decade,which is still one of the greatest compilations in rock and roll history. <br /> <br />And 16 songs can hardly encapsulate the career of a musical maverick who has tried on a variety of melodic stylings. <br /> <br />But this colllection does a fairly decent job of putting together Neil's most well known stuff. All the biggies are here: Cinnamon Girl, Southern Man, Old Man, Heart of Gold,and the much later \\"Rockin' in the Free World.\\" <br /> <br />Nevertheless, in a collection this limited, Neil's fans will find a whole host of their favorite album cuts missing. <br /> <br />But that misses the point because this album isn't for the established fan: This is for the neophyte, the person who is hearing Neil for the first time and only wants \\"the hits\\" on one tidy cd. This disc fills that gap in Neil's catalog. <br /> <br />One word of criticism: The remastering job isn't as good as it could have been: The songs don't sound as sharp and crisp and clean as one would expect from a remastered recording (maybe it's just my ITunes downloaded version that sounds that way). Still, if you are just getting into Neil, start here.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. Even though it was a love triangle involving a computer I felt for edgar. I've been waiting for ages for this to come on DVD as it is one of my favorite movies. I hope the sudio will release it soon cause there are a lot of us here waiting to see it.
B00006RAKP|5.0|There's no way you can reduce Elton John's career to one cd and do it justice. So we have this beautifully remastered collection of hits on two cds. The first cd is devoted exclusively to Elton John's Greatest Hits from the 1970s. This is all right, because many of Elton's long time fans will agree that this was his most creative and prolific period. You get Bennie and the Jets, Crocodile Rock, Honky Cat, Good bye Yellow Brick Road, Philadelphia Freedom, and much more.    The second cd starts out with a few hits from the 70's, and then covers the 1980s comeback and the 1990s Disney film hits such as \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\\" It concludes with This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore, which recalls Elton's musical style from the 1970s. It is a fitting closure to a wonderful tour through John's career.    I have two very minor quibbles: One: I would have liked to have seen Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters, Border Song, Last Song, and Madman Across the Water on here, but I realize that there was no room and that these songs can be readily downloaded off of the Net. Number two: Honky Cat and Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting are presented in slightly edited versions (the songs fade out earlier than their original incarnations).    But these small complaints aside, this is the best collection of Elton you can buy, with the best remastered sound.
B000301YY8|3.0|British singing-sensation James Blunt has gained worldwide fame with his massive hit You're Beautiful, enthralling fans with his falsetto pipes. Released in 2004 in England, James Blunt's debut album is currently making a splash on the American music scene, but James Blunt has already achieved massive success in Europe with songs such as You're Beautiful, Goodbye My Lover, So Long, Jimmy and No Bravery. Love or hate him, James Blunt has, unquestionably, made an impact with the larger-than-life ballad You're Beautiful, appealing to both teenagers and their parents as well. Stationed for a year as a soldier in Kosovo, James Blunt's encounters with the horrors of war is presumably depicted on a number of songs on Back To Bedlam, illustrating that Mr. Blunt is not merely concerned with the inner workings of the heart in a purely romantic way. So, is Back To Bedlam worthy of your hard-earned money?    Opening with the sound of guitar strings, High welcomes the listener, describing the `'Beautiful Dawn'' as a personal friend and a guidance in life. Sung in a mellow manner, the verses serve as a contrast to the unrestrained choruses. While I like the simplicity of the verses and generally prefer James Blunt's voice without the `'falsetto-quality'', he frequently employs on Back To Bedlam, it seems appropriate to use falsetto on this particular track due to the nature of the lyrics. Though You're Beautiful may not be everyone's favorite cup of tea, James Blunt has ensured himself an international hit with a recognizable topic. Although I tend to dislike the song the more I'm exposed to it, I, indisputably, comprehend the general appeal of You're Beautiful. Wisemen is easily the best track on Back To Bedlam and the primary reason why I went out on a limp and bought the album, completely disregarding You're Beautiful. Unlike many of the songs on James Blunt's debut album, the slightly annoying falsetto-singing is not featured on this particular track. Besides, the melodious and the tougher sound, featured on Wisemen, is a nice welcoming on the ballad-heavy Back To Bedlam. Each to their liking, I guess!!    The heartfelt Goodbye My Lover appears to be a fan-favorite as well. Originally, I thought the theme and the refrain worked quite well, and they still do. Nevertheless, the rather clichéd lyrics bothers me to some extent. While others regard Goodbye My Lover among the better tracks on Back To Bedlam, I simply have to disagree. However, do not despair - Back To Bedlam does have its moments: the melancholic Out Of My Mind, the passionate Billy and the Red Hot Chili Peppers-eque So Long, Jimmy. Granted, So Long Jimmy does not sound reminiscent of a Red Hot Chili Peppers' track, but the teasing bass-lick sounds strangely similar to a Red Hot Chili Peppers song. No Bravery is one of the several songs, which deals with the hardships of war. In fact, one could easily link a majority of the songs on Back To Bedlam with the consequences of war, yet they could also be interpreted from a different viewpoint, depending on one's own interpretation of the songs.     Surely, Back To Bedlam will satisfy a large potion of people, while others will be severely disappointed. While Back To Bedlam does have several flaws; questionable lyrics, annoying falsetto-vocals and a tad too heavy in the ballad-department, James Blunt's debut album displays potential with High, Wisemen, Out Of My Mind, So Long Jimmy and Billy. However, lacking on Back To Bedlam is diversity and an edgier sound. I really think it would suit as a perfect contrast to his mellow and soft voice; needless to say I'm aware others will disagree. Put simply, if you simply love You're Beautiful and Goodbye My Lover, I would strongly advise you to purchase Back To Bedlam in the nearest record store (or on Amazon).
B000069HKH|5.0|This album reallly grew on me with repeated listenings. I loved the rollicking optimism of \\"Waitin' On a Sunny Day\\" and \\"Countin' On a Miracle,\\" the moving and introspective \\"Nothing Man\\" (which recalls Tunnel of Love's \\"Walk Like a Man\\"), and the driving melody propelling the listener \\"Further On (Up the Road)\\".    I was also impressed with \\"Mary's Place,\\" which sounds like it could have been written for the Born to Run album. And the studio version of \\"My City of Ruins\\" will make the hair on your neck stand up, even though the song becomes mired down in endless repetitions of \\"Rise Up!\\"    The heavy lyrical repetition is also manifest in \\"Lonesome Day,\\" and \\"Empty Sky.\\" Otherwise, this is one of the best Springsteen albums because of the musical variety on the record, the fifties styled \\"Let's Be Friends,' the world music tinged \\"World's Apart,\\" and the aforementioned Gospel inflected \\"My City of Ruins.\\" Buy this CD!
B000244FDW|1.0|Hi Just wanted to warn every one of this awful adaption of Pride and prejudice...First, You just have to look at the front to see that Jane AND lizzy are both really ugly the nicest you could call them would be not even tolerable. 1 Lizzy has eyes that are sticking out she way to thin her hairs awful there is nothing about her in the least that isa appealing. jane is a little better but not by much. 2 both are bad actresses. The movie has almost no music the quality is quite bad, the sister, mother, and father are bad actors themselves. Mr. darcy and Mr Bingly are both wow you feel bad for them. there pretty bad themselves so I recommend this to any one who has tons of time on there hands feels like laphing at awful acting, and watching the most boring dull non- intersting movie ever then enjoy but others wise don't wast your money or pay attention to the four stars this movie has been given. I love Pride and prejudice so its nothing against the movie itself... just this version.
B000002C2E|5.0|The production is murky and brooding, the lyrics are pensive and ruminating, but the music is entrancing and it rewards repeated listening. I love the wistfulness of Standing in the Doorway, the desperation undergirding \\"Million Miles,\\" the resolute beat and melody of \\"Cold Irons Bound,\\" and the spiritual yearning of \\"Trying to Get to Heaven.\\" In that last song, I really like the line where he says \\"I've been to Sugartown,I've shook the sugar down, now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.\\" I do not know if the lyrics are biographical, but they are befitting a man who has just had a serious health crisis and is about to turn 60.    This album doesn't rock with abandon like \\"Love and Theft\\" or \\"Highway 61 Revisited.\\" But it is a catchy and thought provoking reflection on life and mortality, and I highly recommend it.
0156027321|4.0|I love the way this book was written, though I do admit that parts were painful to read since I brought my own emotions into it.  This  book might be too much for someone young, say below the age of 13.  I think older kids, and adults alike can benefit from the lessons learned throughout this book.<br /><br />I am honored to have been introduced to Pi and Richard Parker.
B00004TWZF|1.0|A friend and I saw this in the theater when it was released, and found that it compared favorably to Andy Warhol's \\"Empire\\" for  \\"movie where absolutely nothing happens.\\"  The absurdity of \\"free diving\\" as a spectator sport is complemented by the surrealism of pianos on the beach, etc.  As we were walking home, my friend asked, \\"What was the purpose of having Rosanna Arquette in the movie?\\"  I coolly replied, \\"Well, she's the love interest.  Without her the whole movie would just be about two guys holding their breath.\\"  That last line has been a running joke between us for 18 years.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I played Final Fantasy VII many years ago, when I was still single and living in my dad's house. I'm now married with two children and so you can just imagine how long ago that was. I still know my party members -- Cloud, Tifa, Aeris, Barret, Vincent, Yuffie, Cid, and Red XII, but the other characters? With the exception of Jenova and Sephiroth, my mind was a complete blank. In terms of game events, the only thing I remember vividly is Aeris' death. Since I don't have the time nor inclination to replay FFVII, a chunk of the film's plot connections with the game was lost on me. Of course that's probably what the FFVII Digest included in the DVD release is for, but any gamer will attest that nothing can replace the experience of actually beating the game before watching the movie. <br /> <br />But that's the beauty of Advent Children. It's so straightforward and spectacular that one can get blown away purely because of the visuals. As I've said earlier, two years have passed since Cloud and friends defeated Sephiroth. A band of silver-haired and green-eyed Jenova fanatics led by a guy named Kadaj has emerged. They will do anything to retrieve Jenova's head and whatever materia (gem-like spheres with powers) they can get their hands on in order to bring about the \\"reunion\\" (a.k.a. the resurrection of Sephiroth). Cloud returns to Tifa after wandering around by himself, and one by one his old comrades show up in order to help him stop Kadaj and company. It's a very simple RPG-esque plot, but it's the journey that makes the movie. Eye-popping action sequences take up about 80% of screentime. Just about everyone is given the chance to show off their awesome fighting moves, weapons, and limit breaks. I was totally immersed in Advent Children, which is really all about Cloud finding himself behind the context of saving the world. <br /> <br />Advent Children's art and animation surpass all the Final Fantasy games' visuals that precede it. The character designs remain faithful to the game's, only this time the blocky 3D renditions are replaced with very realistic models that could very well pass for human at a glance. The texture of the skin, the luminosity of the eyes, the movement of the hair... it's all too perfect. You won't be able to take your eyes off them especially when they start to fight. The furious yet impossibly smooth action sequences are just too mesmerizing. You can spend the next hour just watching these guys (and gals) take on each other. The settings and locales such as mountains, forests, and cityscapes are also as superbly detailed as the characters. <br /> <br />I must admit, I felt a bit cheated after watching Advent Children. My memory of the game is no longer what it was, and I felt I was not able to get the full effect that was intended by the creators. It is, however, undeniably a visual feast that's worth treating yourself to player or not. Just watch it. Go oooh and aaah over it. After all, this is what a real Final Fantasy film is (not the totally un-Final Fantasy The Spirits Within).  <br /> <br />
0143034901|5.0|Daniel Sempere wakes up one morning and can't remember what his mother looks like.  His father, to ease his sadness, takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books where he instructs him to pick a book carefully that will forever be his to treasure and protect.  Daniel chooses, The Shadow of the Wind, by Julian Carax.  He goes home and devours it and wants to read more by the auther.  He soon discovers that someone has been destroying every book that Julian Carax ever wrote and had published.  Daniel wants to uncover the mystery surrounding the author Carax, and thus begins the journey....<br /><br />This was a great character driven book but was also a truly unique story.  Each chapter ended giving you more information, just enough information, that you wanted to keep going.  I didn't want the book to end but I couldn't put it down to make it last longer.  You'll love the characters and the story - a beautifully written book - I would definitely recommend it.
B00004ZEQX|3.0|I have Zombi and then I picked up this flick (House by the Cemetary).  I liked House...better than Zombi. It just had a better story and acting, but, like Zombi, had great gore for it's time.  It does have an annoying bratty little blond boy in it, but adds it the films campyness.  I wasn't really impressed with ZOMBI, but figured I'd give another Fulci flick a try..glad I did=gonna check out more of them in the future..
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|If Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep somehow managed to have a bastich son... wait! They already have! It's called WOLFMOTHER! <br /> <br />Great rock and roll in the 70's tradition, just like new bands like Cavalar, Wicked Minds and Black Bonzo are following. Highly listenable.
B00005JP8V|1.0|I went to see this movie with high hopes of a cool film that finally involved male witches of the day=hoping it would be as cool as the craft=but was way disappointed.  The movie started off cool with the intro. featuring a remix of a white zombie song, cops chasing the witch guy's suv and escaping using their powers, to a boring story with boring pretty boy characters and the most boring use of the term \\"witchcraft\\" and basing the film in a town in Mass...there are no spells, no potions, just an ambrecromie clone foursome boy sandwich with glowey eyes and power to knock poeple into walls...plus, some of the story was about saving a girl, blah,blah,blah...The only thing that will appeal to some girls and gay guys watching this film will be going ga-ga over the hottie main character, Caleb, and pool & shower scenes showing these boys in nothing but their swim trunks and revealing their men's health cover-guy bodies..If you are Gothic and love horror movies-this will leave you unfulfilled=STAY AWAY FROM THIS FLICK!!..Will their ever be a decent movie made about guys into the craft?
B000CNE092|5.0|I first saw this movie when it orginally came out in the theaters. The first thing that grabbed me was the animation. Some of scenes are just so stunning, and moved as if there were actual cameras moving around (ex. Anya on the staircase as she first enters the palace, the Dowager Empress entering the car as Dimitri slips in to drive). The cast is great, Meg Ryan is perfect as Anastasia, and the songs are wonderful.  <br /> <br />I was somewhat surprised to find out that it was not a Disney film, but done by Fox. However, I think that was because it reminds you of the films that were made in Disney's Golden Era (Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast) rather than the stuff they've made since. <br /> <br />The only thing I did not like is the scene/song of Rasputin in what I assume is some sort of Purgatory since they refer to him as dead, but he can still come to Earth and attempt to kill Anastasia. It is pointless, and a little creepy to have him singing and dancing with demonic creatures. I fast forward through that scene every time, and the rest of the movie is great.  <br /> <br />Finally, I love the dabbling into Russian history. Here is an animated story with some meat to the story! It goes much further than a love story, dealing with the Russian revolution and including real-life people such as Rasputin--though they obviously took liberties with the events. The song set in Paris is great, with many \\"cameos\\" by famous people that the parents watching the movie would know. It also delves into the realites of growing up as an orphan and wanting that place to belong.  <br /> <br />Wonderful movie! Loved it.
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|I saw this film in the 60's ...and it certainly hasn't improved with age; unless you view watching grass grow as a highlight of your daily existence.  This film plods along at an excruciatingly, slow pace until you are ready to scream for it to end.  It's nothing more than the film version of pop art: a simplistic story of a photographer who shot a murder on film; which is subsequently stolen.  End of plot and movie, unless you enjoy watching mimes playing tennis at the end.  Don't waste valuable time making sense of this film.  You'd be better off watching clouds and interpreting what you see in them and what they mean, and probably get more out of that experience then you would watching this film!!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Many people seem to be ambivilant about Octavarium, not saying it's good, and stopping short of saying it's bad. At the very least, it seems that many listeners consider this to be a somewhat lackluster album.    My friends, this is the farthest thing from the truth that one could say about this. \\"Octavarium\\" is one of Dream Theater's finest hours. It combines everything they have learned over the course of their long, illustrious career, from the melodic passages of \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" to the bone-crushing ferocity of \\"Train of Thought.\\" Following is a track-by-track critique.    The Root of All Evil--A great way to start off. A continuation of Portnoy's AA suite, it carries on the themes of The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul. 4.5/5    The Answer Lies Within--I used to despise this song..I found it far too similar to The Spirit Carries On, and also too sugary for my tastes. However, after giving it a chance, it's really grown on me. The lyrics are overly-simple, but if you have an open mind, it's really quite charming. Also, Labrie's voice is in top shape on this song. 4/5     These Walls--In my opinion, the weakest track on the album. There are some thrilling moments, such as the build ups to the chorus, but overall it's nothing special. 3/5     I Walk Beside You--A track that is mercilessly bashed. Despite it's obvious commercial aspects, I really enjoy this song. It's smooth and flowing. It's quite refreshing to have a restrained song from Dream Theater once in awhile, and this song works wonderfully. 4/5    Panic Attack--The best of the first 7 tracks on the album. The intensity of this song will shatter your brain into a million pieces. It far surpasses anything on Train of Thought, and Petrucci and Rudess' solos are nothing short of amazing, as always. 5/5    Never Enough--The beginning of this song sounds almost EXACTLY like the beginning of a song by Muse. Nevertheless, this is another great song. I love the distortion that Labrie's voice has. The chorus is a little weak, but overall it's a worthwile listen. 4.5/5     Sacrificed Sons--I'm a little undecided about this track. I enjoy the first 2/3 of it, but after that it seems to fall off into incoherance. Also, there is a section that sounds almost note for note like a part of Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Diary Of a Madman.\\"    And finally, that brings us to...    Octavarium--Holy [...]! This is truly one of the most amazing musical experiences I have ever had, and seeing it performed live makes it even better...this is Dream Theater's Magnum Opus, and is in my opinion their best work so far. 100/5!    The theme of octaves is present throughout. Obviously, there are 8 tracks on the disk. Also, the 1st track is titled \\"The Root of All Evil,\\" with \\"root\\" being a musical term for the foundation of a chord or, in this case, an octave. The beginning and last note are the same, which creates a feeling of truly being \\"trapped\\" inside the album--however, one wouldn't mind being trapped inside such an amazing feat of musicianship at all!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Dylan has not put out a really good album since Blood on the Tracks, he has had a few good songs on a select few albums but generally speaking his music was uncreative, dull and sophomoric.     Dylan has spent most of his long career recreating himself, morphing from one person into the next and into the next, etc.  Well, he has finally morphed into a sound that is more than just palatable, it is truly enjoyable.  The rich lyrics linger somewhere between joy and despair, the mood is bluesy sometimes haunting.  He has lost some of his voice but he does not over extend it, and his gravely nasal voice actually works relatively well with the music.      I have one complaint about this album, the price is higher because of so-called bonus material.  What a bunch of BS, it is not bonus anything it is a friggin ad for previous albums. Seems like Dylan fits right into the times, disrespect for the consumer...get them to pay more for nothing but another sales pitch.
B000002LND|4.0|I like this artist because she is a controversy person. She didn't care about what you are going to think about her. She is unique. She was the first female artist to have control of her music and image. I like how she manipulates the media and her public with her music, videos and her sexuality. She started from nothing and now she is a celebrity who sells a millions of records. Madonna is one of my favorite artist. I enjoy listening her music.
B000HT386M|3.0|I would totally give this movie a 5 star rating but I watched it with my 10 year old daughter and thought it could be cleaned up a bit. There are parts in this movie that really didn't need to be in it and still maintain it's integrity. A dog humping a stuffed toy more then once in a movie is not funny just disgusting and inappropriate for kids. Without these scenes this movie could have been for all ages, but I guess in this day and age that's asking for too much.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|... Quincy Jones' theme from \\"Ironside\\".  An excerpt from it is on the soundtrack.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|Merle Haggard is a musical genius, and this album shows why.  Twenty six career spanning, great songs from one of country's greatest singer/songwriters.  VERY highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just picked up the complete series on DVD and found the first two episodes excellent and very well written. I like the 'slow' ships in this series as compared to the 'Trans-Warp' crafts from Star Trek. This series is very well thought and written and the sets, though not extensive are quite realistic and convey the space based Wild West look and feel. I have no idea why this series did not take off. It should have...
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Best Scheherazade I ever heard. The performace was exciting and touching. The SACD provides so much details and dynamics of the recording that it makes me really feel that I was there. <br /> <br />
B00003CXDG|2.0|This film will be reminded as one the major technological achievements in the last year of the XX Century. A true feast for the eyes of those who just want to have a good fun over 126 min. The film owns a frenetic rhythm, but there is something weak in the script that simply worries us since the first minutes.<br /><br />John Woo made a flamboyant and challenging picture, that asks our total indulgence with hard to believe acrobatic sequences over a motorcycle. But the script ( the vertebral column of any single movie) does not resist a serious analysis, and that's a real shame, because all the cast was effective and although there are many hair raising sequences, you leave the hall with a sensation of emptiness, as you had eaten three  hamburgers in rigorous tandem. It' s far to be the same, to eat like a Viking than feed oneself like a gourmet.<br /><br />Cruise is special effective and his personage is even much more human respect his previous entry. Ving Rhames is splendid in his hard to die role, but I found Tandy Newton a mite cold and inexpressive in her role.<br /><br />The movie was a true success according the ratio profit vs. inversion, but this is not the only exertion' s indicator of a good movie.
B0000025D0|5.0|Let me start off by stating that I don't think there can be much argument that 'Born to Run' and 'Darkness on the Edge of Town', to this day, stand as Bruce's two finest recorded achievements.  Bar none.  However, like all great art, their excellence is measured in different ways.  'Born to Run' was almost like a grand opera -- it contained songs that talked about finding redemption by escaping, chasing dreams, and romanticized the streets and urban toughness.  It was kind of like 'West Side Story' meets Phil Spector, and its grandeur reached its peak with the title track; one of the greatest rock anthems of all time.  'Darkness on the Edge of Town', on the other hand, states in no uncertain terms that life will never be easy for many, many people out there.  Escapism is again present in songs like &#34;Something in the Night&#34; and &#34;Racing in the Street&#34;, but this time its an escapism not of romantic qualities but of fear and loneliness, trying to find some sort of meaning in an empty existence.  The title track puts forward a man who is essentially stripped bare - he's lost his romantic companion, his posessions, his home...but not his willingness to fight back.  He's maintained his inner pride.  And that's what is so inspirational and moving about 'Darkness' - for every song of defeatism like &#34;Factory&#34;, there's an anthem like &#34;Badlands&#34; or &#34;The Promised Land&#34; that says essentially that no matter how hard or bad things get, you can fight back because you have NOT lost your pride or soul. When I have reached low points in my own life, 'Darkness' is an album that I frequently turn to because it offers more answers and good will than any form of therapy would.  After this album was released, Bruce and the E Street Band embarked on what could very well be the greatest rock 'n roll tour of all time...it was the one that established Bruce as one of the best live performers ever.  Bruce and the band went on to release several other excellent albums, but the period of 1975 through 1978 was a very special one for these guys because they almost single-handedly saved American rock from irrelevance.  No better example of that can be shown than on 'Darkness on the Edge of Town'.  Buy it...it WILL become one of the essential soundtracks to your life.
B000H305U0|5.0|I completely love this ENTIRE cd!  Great job JT for coming with it on the 2nd cd.  This cd has a different sound than the 1st one but i'm totally into it.  Great job.  I definitely recommend adding this CD to u'r collection!
B000089RVX|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD.  Evanescence is my favorite band... the music is AWESOME!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|First I'm Christian, secondly I think this is a great movie.  I'm not gonna write a review(tons have already done that, see this movie it is good) I just wanted to comment on a few people who are saying this is anti-semetic.   <br /> <br />How is this anti-semetic?  Yes, GASP it shows Jews cruxifying Jesus, thats what really happened.  It also shows the Romans part in it all too.  So what should we do now, well lets never mention the Holocaust(it would be against Germans) and lets never mention slavery(its against whites) and lets never mention the World Trade Center attacks because it will be against Muslims!  Not all Jews cruxified Jesus, not all Muslims flew the planes into the World Trade Center, not all whites were slave owners during the far gone centuries, not all Germans were nazas!  This movie is not anti-semetic, it is being made that by people who are against the Christian faith.  And that my friends is sad, there is still bias in this world, aimed mostly at those who believe.......
1401301010|4.0|In this dissertation on the first forty years of his time on planet earth, Anthony Kiedis neither glorified his life(style) nor used what he had to say about it as a platform to make the point, \\"See how low I sank?\\" Kiedis was simply honest and left, one frequently gets the impression, nothing unmentioned in this memoir about a creative, sometimes sleazy life that was filled with risk-taking, extreme drug abuse, and excesses of every sort. Kiedis is a bright man with a questioning nature who doesn't try to hide anything he did along the way to where he is today, an unlikely survivor and spiritual pilgrim. Scar Tissue tells about death, crime, fame, music, sex, pain, loss, the celebrated and the infamous, and provides us with the ultimate backstage pass to twenty years of existence within The Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B00005QEO1|4.0|Aerosmith's first four albums (especially \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"ROcks\\") were terrific albums coming from a true musical jugernaut. Then they used drugs to an extreme, tanked and I thought for sure they were through.<br /><br />\\"Pump\\" was a return to the 1970's style Aerosmith, the swanky, strutting, rock Gods title that they relinquished circa 1978.<br /><br />\\"Love in the Elevator\\" seems to start up right from \\"Rocks\\" since it is a kicking, rocking piece of rock sleaze. \\"Janies got a gun\\" has a cool baritone guitar riff. \\"F.I.N.E.' and \\"Monkey on my Back\\" sounds like a band that re-found their confidence. \\"The other side\\" and \\"What it takes\\" are killer songs that sound like they are right out of the 1970's.<br /><br />After \\"Pump' they got all corporate, had professional song writers, and lost their mojo. When you think about it, putting out 5 great albums is a pretty good accomplishment. Not many bands have done it!
B00005JMEW|4.0|What critics see as paying homage to the 70's film styles,I think is very shrewd copy catting.  Be that as it may, this movie was a hoot to watch and David Carridine looks terrific for his age, he must be pushing 70.  I never thought Uma was anything close to pretty, but she does have a certain vunerable toughness about her, so she was good in this role.  Who really blew me away was Daryl Hannah, I thought the fake nurse looked familiar but I couldn't place her until I read the credits and saw her name, she was excellent and unexpected.  She never had a part like this one, she should do more roles like this because she certainly shined in this movie.  I thought she deserved more attention.  Enjoy!
B00002SSKI|4.0|And I still love it as an early 20-something. I originally had it taped off the TV (how sad) and it's now a brilliant addition to my collection. I could watch this film over and over and not get tired of it.<br /><br />Now & Then also has a brilliant cast. Christina Ricci (growing out of her Wednesday Addams character, and playing a character who tapes her breasts down - she later in life had them reduced), Thora Birch, Gaby Hoffman, Demi Moore, Melanie Griffith, Rita Wilson, Rosie O'Donnell, Devon Sawa, Janeane Garofalo, Hank Azaria and Bonnie Hunt amongst others. Also look out for a young Rumer Willis as one of the main character's sisters, and an early appearance by Brendan Fraser.<br /><br />Now & Then is the sweetest story is about four girls growing up - and growing apart. They make a pact and twenty years later, come back to support one of their old friends giving birth. (Considering this is the same girl who got told by her mother what sex is: \\"All women have a garden, and a garden needs a big hose to water it... or a small hose... as long as it works.\\" It's a wonder she became pregnant in the first place!)<br /><br />I was quite disappointed when I was young, as I originally muddled up which older actress was actually the younger actress in the film. For instance I thought Christina Ricci's character grew up to be Demi Moore. Noooo. Christina's character grows up to be Rosie O'Donnell. The rest of them I managed to piece together, but God knows how I ended up thinking that.<br /><br />This is a lovely film, and will forever remain in my collection. It's perfect for snuggling up on the couch with some chocolate (or rice pudding!) while it's dark outside.
0670034711|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a true talent--funny, sad, earthy, fresh, and evocative. A modern day Mark Twain, she sees the comedy and pathos in the very same situation. <br /> <br />This is a book to savor, then share with friends. But ask to get it back--it seems like the kind of book that would be fun to re-read from time to time.
B000FQJAIW|3.0|I normally don't like to comment on titles when I see over 300 reviews written, but in all of the reviews I read, no one has mentioned this.  <br /> <br />This IS the 1977 release on Disc 2. This is not \\"A New Hope\\" which means it cannot be from the LaserDisc master (which I own two complete sets of). The movie on Disc 2 does not have \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\" after the title disappears into the distance. To the best of my knowledge, this version has NEVER been legally available on video in any format. All video releases have had the secondary title added during the re-release. I realize this may seem minor to some people, but this is great for a fan like myself.  <br /> <br />I do agree with many of the other reviewers about the quality. This is a complete disrespect to the movie that started it all. Plus, keep in mind that the movies in the original trilogy had ground-breaking, award-winning special effects - all hidden by CGI in later editions.  <br /> <br />Just like I said in another review, to me, the CGI used in the special edition (Disc 1) is like adding CGI to the old Flash Gordon serials. It's not needed, and it just doesn't look right.  The movie and effects would be from different decades. There is a certain appeal to seeing old special effects. We don't need a release of a classic serial where the sparklers on the engines are replaced with CGI flames, we don't need to see classic Godzilla monsters replaced by CGI effects, and we don't need to see a ring when something explodes at the end of Star Wars. It destroys the charm.
B00005JOQS|4.0|The newest incarnation of Superman, Superman Returns, starring Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey, is a moving blend of adventure, drama, characterization and love-- love of the purest kind that can never be realized. There's enough humor in it to keep it from being too heavy, enough explosions and terror scenes to make a satisfying action flick, and gentle tributes to the Christopher Reeve movies with the love theme from Christopher Reeves' Superman blended into the music to provide a bridge from the past to the present.  <br /> <br />The movie takes up five years from where Superman IV left off. Kevin Spacey, playing a wonderfully evil Lex Luthor is back on the loose after a successful appeal of his two life sentences--as he dryly explains it, Superman's great at making arrests, but he's not real good on the follow through things such as reading the Miranda Rights and showing up to testify in court. <br /> <br />Meanwhile Lois Lane is about to receive a Pulitzer for an editorial she wrote called \\"Why the World Does Not Need Superman.\\" In the five years since Superman left, she has moved on with her life and is engaged to and living with her son, Jason and the Publisher's nephew, Jason White. <br /> <br />Superman returns to Earth after visiting the planet Krypton and finding that it was completely destroyed and that there is nothing left of the planet or his people. He returns to Earth, expecting to take up where he left off, only to find that the world has moved on without him. Nevertheless, he resumes his Clark Kent persona, along with his job at the Daily Planet; and tries to reconnect with Lois. <br /> <br />This movie perhaps exposes his vulnerability in a way that we've never seen before, while at the same time emphasizes that he is the superest of all super heroes. He's comfortable in his role as the savior of the world and sees it at his duty--we don't have the angst of \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\" that we have with Spiderman orthe moody, brooding atmosphere of Batman. <br /> <br />We'll ignore the little things such as why nobody thinks it's strange that Clark Kent returns at exactly the same time as Superman, or why Clark is never around when Superman is on the scene or how Superman seems to know everything that Clark knows. In superhero land, those little inconsistencies just have to be accepted--much like in Shakespeare when characters don \\"disguises\\" that anyone with an ounce of sense can see through. And yes, there are all sorts of Christ-like symbols spattered throughout the movie; they do hit the viewer rather heavily with the concept that Superman is a secular savior--but that's okay, too. <br /> <br />The point is, Superman is back. And it's great to see him again. <br />
B0009MAP90|4.0|IT was the coldest winter on record. Some of the guys and I from the Chase-Plaza construction site decided to hustle into one of the Village's basket clubs. We huddled together at a small table, coffees and creamers all around. Wooden chairs creaked under our weight, and the place was filled with a bustle so common to small restaurants- the clattering of plates and silverware, the beat of rubber soles upon wood floors.<br /><br />Up on the stage was a quiet kind of child- he looked like he belonged in a museum! His face was impossibly untainted, and, combined with his uneasy movements, gave the impression of a marionette. He began to tune his guitar, and then hummed on the harmonica for brief moments- suffice it to say, almost no one looked toward the stage; there was a slow rumble of talk, every now and then a single phrase rose through the fog.<br /><br />The guitar began to rear up, and then the kid started to sing. There was a moment of uncertainty at first. No one could understand that the voice came from the kid. His voice, its timbre and pitch, sounded as if it came from a man three times his age. It was as if he were performing ventriloquism; only that the voice's source came from someplace we couldn't see, only feel. The emotions of self-inflicted misery and calamitous love for another coursed through his words; and everyone understood, the sweet heartache of a woman who both saps and gives us our strength.<br /><br />His next song seemed to roll right off the frozen Village streets. Harmonica premiered, a dizzy zig-zag of notes that blended disorientation and comfort. The crowd rumbled with sympathetic musings as he sung about the oppression of the big city, the wheelings-and-dealings that the honest man could never get his hands around: \\"People going down to the ground: buildings going up to the sky.\\" The several minutes that the song occupied constituted a perfect moment: the artist became the spokesman for the audience's consciousness.<br /><br />As the boy offered more and more songs, we were transformed, from casual patrons into devout listeners: the music seemed to surge from a place far back in time, when the primary way to experience music was not to hear it, but to sing it. His voice had all the craggy imperfections of a raggedy southern farm hand, relating the tragedies and the prayers of a life of hard work.<br /><br />I could tell, both the young boy and we were exhausted when he bottomed out the session with \\"Song To Woody.\\" He gave us a short preface to this work, and this new voice seemed otherworldly, alien, compared to the one with which the audience had been so affixed. Of course, the guys and I had all heard most of Woody's work. But few of us had heard anything as plainly honest as this song. Listening to it, it seemed to hold an eternity with it, as if it composed all the truth and excellence one could hope for in music.<br /><br />But it ended. Afterwards, the boy stepped to a corner. Nearby were a few records, his face posted upon them. Most everyone clamored for them, but my friends and I managed to buy one each. We slid it inside our jackets, then headed outside. Tomorrow would be another lesson in breaking our backs, but it was as if this experience had rejuvenated each of us.<br /><br />Looking back now, it's hard for me to understand the face on this record. He's different now than he ever was back then; he's become a signature of an entire social kinesis. In fact, Dylan is more an idea than he even is a human being like us. This picture of him, though, shows him back when he was nothing! Just a nobody kid from Minesota who could give a knockout session. Back then, as one of those old construction crew friends of mine have said, Dylan was un-Dylan-like. But this first opus, this first success, although it borrows much from other musicians, shows the awesome talent that eventually manifested the whirl-wind of creativity that the United States (and other countries, to a lesser extent) knowsas Bob Dylan.r extent) knows as Bob Dylan. <br />
B000683VI4|4.0|... because that's what I'd pick. As usual, I don't want to synopsize any movie. It spoils it for me to hear the plot ahead of time. Like another reviewer, I was a bit put off by the ending (hence \\"only\\" 4-7/8 stars). It was tied a little too neatly in a bow. On the other hand, one particular scene shortly before the end made the final ending a welcome relief. Having just buried my father recently, I know (we all know) how ugly it could have been.   <br /> <br />My father and James Garner were the same age and I always thought they looked quite a bit alike. When I was eight  years old, Jim lived in an apartment across the street from us in North Hollywood. He got dressed up in his Marverick outfit, hat and all, before he got into his car to go to work. \\"Handsome\\" doesn't begin to describe that sight. I probably wouldn't have met him except that his step-daughter, Kim, was my age. I doubt it will surprise anyone to find out that Jim was a very nice guy. A dust-bowl kid from Oklahoma with the non-Hollywood name of \\"James Bum-Garner.\\" Names like Bum-Garner and Buck-Walter were typical of that time and origin. I remember that Mom watched over Kim till school started one morning while Jim got his name changed legally. <br /> <br />It's silly, but watching Jim throughout the years has always given me a sense of pride -- not because I'd \\"known\\" him but because he looked like my Dad and, like Dad, was such a jewel of a human being. Watching him work at this level of excellence is enough on its own. His resemblance to my father is purely coincidental.  <br /> <br />People who label movies as sappy quite often are missing the point. A movie that moves us this much deserves more than such predictable criticism. Same with those who say it wasn't worthy of an Academy Award nomination. If Jim hasn't received an Oscar yet, he will do so for his body of work -- if there's time. He could have easily won an Oscar for this performance as could the talented and beautiful Gena Rowlands.The kids are wonderful too.  <br /> <br />At least rent this movie. You'll end up buying it for someone you love.

B000GRUMPU|3.0|If you're wanting to see a disaster movie just for the sake of a disaster movie, this one's for you. It's got some great special effects and CGI work, some heart-pounding moments, and a lot of gore. <br /> <br />If, however, you actually want to care about whether the characters in peril actually die or not, you'll probably want to skip this one. There was absolutely no character development other than some superficial storylines. The acting wasn't bad, but they didn't have much of a script to work with. I was disappointed, generally.
B00005JP0A|5.0|I am quite surprised with the amount of poor reviews this movie has been receiving.  When I first saw The Devil Wears Prada, I saw it with my fiance, and let me tell you we loved this movie.      It starts out with a girl going to a job interview and being the most unlikely candidate for the job.  She ends up getting the job, much to her surprise and the surprise of her co-workers, and then it takes her on a rollercoaster ride.  Her integrity and passion for the job is questioned throughout the movie; she and her boyfriend even have trouble because of her job.      Everyone in this movie did wonderfully with their performances.  Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep and I am not sure of her name but the girl who played Emily were by far the best!      It's a funny, sad and probably the most real movie I have ever seen.  If you are a workaholic you will definately LOVE this movie!  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|First off, I'm a fan of the classic rock bands that Wolfmother is ripping off.  Second, I recognize that every band has its influences and I'm not just saying Wolfmother is a ripoff because of their sound.      Wolfmother's problem is that they don't bring anything new or original to the table, their lyrics are absolutely HORRIBLE and empty, and they sound like they have the inspiration of a band that was formed to make TV ad jingles.  All of this applies to the band JET as well.    I'm going to write the chorus for the next Wolfmother/Jet song right now:  \\"She's gonna break your heart, right from the start / You'd better reach up high, up to the sky\\"  There you go guys, I won't even ask for royalties.    Again, there's not necessarily anything wrong with taking a sound from a great band and doing your own thing with it, provided you have talent and the songs you're making show creativity/talent/substance.    If this is the type of music you're into, you'll be much better off with bands like The White Stripes, The Black Keys, and Eagles of Death Metal (in that order).
B00006AUIG|5.0|Session 9 is not so much a horror film as it is a suspenseful thriller. An outstanding cast complemented by an intricate plot coalesces with great cinematography to yield a movie that will keep you on edge and guessing to the end.<br /><br />A down on their luck asbestos abatement crew take on a high pressure project to sanitize the Danvers Mental Hospital....a sad overbearing and depressing building of late 1800's design. The viewers are lulled into the storyline by one of the workers who tells the history of one patient's experience at the treatment facility. The strained interpersonal relationships, tight deadlines and foreboding atmosphere create a pressure cooker of stress for the characters. The \\"Session\\" tapes of one therapists treatments are used as a device to set the tone for the movie....a soundtrack of sadness if you will. It's a clever tool which enhances the atmosphere and leaves the viewer waiting for the next installment. The days tick by with each one holding new challenges for the crew until one by one....they succumb to the evil which lies amongst them.<br /><br />An excellent film suitable for older teens that can process the content and a worthy addition to any film aficionado's shelf...buy it or rent it for that dreary autumn night!.
B00005O5CM|3.0|No matter how much or little you've heard of this film, you should by now be aware of one thing: its main point is, or seems to be, proving that blondes aren't stupid. Am I the only one who believes it didn't do as good a job proving that point as it could have? I happen to be a blonde and I think I'm a reasonably intelligent one, thank you. However, I do not a) love shopping b) know every shoe type or c) adore pink. And yet, this movie seems determined to prove that those three things are what all blondes do. Excuse me if I don't find that flattering or hilarious. I appreciate clever comedies as much as the next person, but if someone expected me to either lavishly praise this movie or say something along the lines of, \\"Oh, this movie's SUCH a credit to blondes everywhere!\\", it ain't gonna happen. As cute and clever as it sometimes was, this movie failed to impress me on any particular level.   Brief summary: Elle is a very clever young woman who actually decides to choose law school over lounging in a pool all year at her parent's mansion. Before you get too impressed, though, Elle mainly did this to win back her boyfriend, not because she'd always dreamed of being a lawyer (then again, maybe that's a point in her favor). In spite of her partially shallow motives, however, she excells in law school, blows away many of her classmates, and proves to have far more brains than many gave her credit for. The story does very well by portraying not only Elle's clever and sometimes hilarious tactics, but her own personal struggle as she tries to fit in with the other students and recover from her boyfriend's cruel treatment. However, its pitfalls come from painfully goofy moments, even more painfully stupid characters, and, occasionally, the same message that it seems to attempt to disprove: that blondes aren't automatically dumb.   While Elle's definitely smart, she is also occasionally an undeniable bimbo. She still dedicates too much time to her looks, dresses in hot pink almost 24/7 (including a sexy-bunny costume to a party and a frilly dress to a TRIAL), and dresses up her lapdog (gag). If the film really wanted to prove that Elle was smart, it could have done without the blondes-are-bimbos stereotype too and given Elle a little more common sense. Two examples: when her first client (a woman suspected of killing her husband) tells Elle that her only alibi to the murder was getting a lipo-suction and she simply can't bear to reveal this to the public, Elle, rather than reminding her that a prison sentence is worse than losing what's left of her reputation, says \\"Your secret is safe with me\\" in a sickeningly reassuring tone. (Your Honor, I'd like to take this moment to point out that Elle's client was blonde too, so her rather stupid reason to not reveal her alibi, and Elle's even dumber understanding of it came off to me as two blondes sharing a \\"blonde moment\\", which rather contradicted the movie's whole point, don't you think?)   Another example was when Elle, hearing two strange girls cruelly reject a boy who asked one of them out, walked up to the boy and loudly asked him why he didn't call her after giving her the best sex of her life. She then stalked off, leaving the two mean girls far more interested in him than they were a few moments ago. My question: why did she bother trying to impress the two witches when she could have just told them off? Much of the story supports the idea that you should credit people for their inner character, so WHY did Elle try to uplift the guy in his crush's eyes after the way she treated him? I was left very disappointed in Elle and furious at the scene's shallow message.   My main peeve with the film, other than the fact that it seemed to say that even smart blondes can't help being fashionably obsessed and fluffy-brained, was that Elle was surrounded by people ten times dumber and shallower than any human has the right to be. Take Elle's client, who she seemed to be so fond of; with her shallow attraction to her pool man (which she almost proudly admitted to in her own trial), her marriage to a guy twice her age, and the fact that she was willing to risk going to prison rather than revealing the fact that she had lipo-suction, I rather hoped she'd be convicted; her extreme shallowness and utter lack of common sense was so infuriating, she almost completely undid any good that Elle gave to the \\"blonde community\\" in the movie. Elle's mother was also tide-pool deep and was shocked that Elle would want to go to law school when she could just laze around in her money. And Elle's friends...well, let's just say that if any person that dumb existed in the real world, they couldn't survive on their own. And yet, people praise the movie for its cleverness. Yes, it's definitely clever in some points, but it also suffers from the extreme annoyance that some of its dumber-than-dirt characters exude. Some good messages, some cute moments, but nothing truly deep or real. Fluffy entertainement with some substance, but don't expect a Harvard degree behind the scriptwriting.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|A great film however if you are going to promote the DVD as widescreen at least make it widescreen and not standard format.
0307276902|4.0|This is an entertaining read, worth the bucks. Listen, all you whiners out there who are crying foul because James Frey made up stuff and exaggerated parts of his book. Are your lives destroyed because you spent the twelve bucks?  What happened, make you fall off the wagon again? Get over it. Nowhere on my copy does it say non-fiction. It's still a good read.
B000059HB7|5.0|Back when entertainment entertained, there was Rio Bravo, the Gesamtkunstwerk of the Old West, what with the Tiomkin score, Big Duke in front of the camera, Walter Brennan complaining from off screen, and Howard Hawks behind the camera. BTW, I understand that scenes containing Harry Carey, Jr., were left on the cutting room floor. How about restoring them?
B000AL730O|5.0|This was one of the best albums released last year. This is what Paul is still capable of, a quality album which may be the best solo album he ever released, certainly up there with \\"Band On The Run\\" for consistent excellence in song. <br /> <br />Chaos earned respectable reviews and was a strong commercial success, even generating hit singles in the UK. It was nominated for several Grammy awards as only a few of his great albums are. He didn't win, but that doesn't take anything away from the great music within. <br /> <br />Nigel Goodrich gives Paul his most appealing production in many years and was a catalyst in challanging Paul to create something inspired, something that recalls the best elements of what makes up McCartney, the musician. The feel to this album is darker, more introspective than the cheery pop alot of people typecast Paul with. He has always been a versatile musician but his class really shines on this album. <br /> <br />Here are my comments on the songs. <br /> <br />Fine Line: <br /> <br />Positive and spirited pop. #20 single in the UK.  <br /> <br />How Kind Of You: <br /> <br />This is McCartney as you have never heard him before. You could just get lost in the music which takes several interesting turns. It is such a good song, with clear and meaningful lyrics. The instrumental closing to this song is fantastic. <br /> <br />Jenny Wren: <br /> <br />The 2nd hit single from this album. An acoustic ballad that recalls Mother Natures Son and Blackbird. This song makes use of the daduk, the first use of the instrument, in fact, in a rock song. At 60 years plus McCartney continues break new ground. In time, Jenny Wren will be remembered as a classic like the two that inspired it. <br /> <br />At the Mercy: <br /> <br />A moody piano ballad with a classic Macca melody. Continues the very strong start to the album. McCartney is revealing his innermost feelings on this song. This song will stick in your head long after you hear it. The chorus could be ranked with his finest. <br /> <br />Friends To Go: <br /> <br />A catchy, melodic, consise song, almost a Beatles song in construction. It doesn't last long but it is jam packed with some fine pop elements and nice harmony singing. This could have been a hit single. George Harrison inspired him on this song. <br /> <br />English Tea: <br /> <br />Some say he is indulging himself with a silly fantasy like ditty. Some say this is the worst song on the album. What it is, however, is a little fun song with a lot of old English charm and it adds a nice little element to the album. It is a short song, was never written to be a world beater, but just for fun. <br /> <br />Too Much Rain: <br /> <br />If Coldplay put this here song out, it would have been a #1 smash. It is a profound song and see's McCartney really embracing Goodrich's influences. It is driven by an acoustic guitar and piano. It is a song for the people who have just had too much pain in their lives. <br /> <br />A Certain Softness: <br /> <br />Paul serenades us with a latino flavoured croon, he goes back way back here, to the music that he loves, that of the 40's and 50's. This romantic song would make a great rumba. The piano is magical. <br /> <br />Riding To Vanity Fair: <br /> <br />Macca sings about betrayal of friendship and trust. In light of recent events in his marriage, this song almost fits where he must be emotionally. This is McCartney as you have never heard before. The song is dark and hypnotic. <br /> <br />Follow Me: <br /> <br />Macca has long been known for the amazing contrast from song to song and this one is a positive ballad that is really inspirational. This was the first song he debuted live before the albums release.  <br /> <br />Promise To You Girl: <br /> <br />He has never been so adventerous and fun since the early Wings days. This song is a pure joy. It is brilliantly constructed with Queen harmonies, rocking piano, nice percussion, this really goes back to some of his inspired and catchy stuff from the late 60's to mid 70's. You hear a nice little electric guitar break, a few sound effects. This is the most uptempo song on the album and one its best. <br /> <br />This Never Happened Before: <br /> <br />A classic Macca love ballad. It never reaches the sappiness of some of his 80's efforts (Motor of Love), yet sounds timeless and endearing. His singing is really outstanding here. I love the way his vocals intertwine as they increase in feeling to close the song. <br /> <br />Anyway: <br /> <br />Great melody, great ballad. But it doesnt close the album, there is the hidden track which is a 3 part medley of various sounds running the gauntlet of classical,techno, grunge and psychadelia. <br /> <br />Get this album if you haven't already. It is brilliant. <br /> <br />
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I want to preface this by saying, I don't like John Mayer's music.  Although I've found a few of his songs catchy and listenable I am by no means a Mayer fan.  I received this cd from a friend and gave it a listen, the truth is it still has no left my CD player.   <br /> <br />Mayer manages to show off his amazing guitar skills that have been displayed on the John Mayer Trio album as well as in live performance, on this album.  Tracks such as I don't Trust Myself, Gravity, and Slow Dancing in a Burning room are destined hit singles.  With the exception of a few lyrical misses on Vultures and Bold as Love, the rest of the tracks are brilliantly written.  The entire cd is listenable and can be listened to from beggining to end. <br /> <br />If you are a fan pick it up this minute.  If you aren't a fan than give it a listen with an open mind and you may find yourself a Mayerhead after a few tracks.
B000000OU0|5.0|I was there for the DVD recording of this concert - Pure Magic - from an era when you had to sound good performing live. These guys still (after all these years)sounded like they were in the studio when live in concert - classic country rock. Lyrically beautiful, instrumentally perfect - it doesn't get any better than this!
B00005JNJV|5.0|Personally, I would easily choose to re-allot the hours of my lifetime spent watching previous \\"Batman . . .\\" films to sitting at red lights, standing in elevators, and waiting in line at the post office.  They never, ever tell the story as it originated, instead choosing to do remakes of the television show--only not as good--with a slight edge on them.  The more recent Batman cartoons have been rather good, and that only added to the mystery as to why an even decent Hollywood film couldn't tell the story half as well despite their many attempts with big budgets and great actors.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />This movie actually enhances the original story of Batman, filling in many of the holes--like how in the hell you get the Batcave built without letting anyone know about it or killing all the builders, and manufacture all sorts of specialty armaments with the knowledge and skills of a pampered billionaire and an English butler.<br /><br />Batman is about doing the wrong thing for the right reasons; and an inner struggle to resolve regret and remorse with a genuine and righteous vengence.  It amazes me that a cartoon artist thought up even the basic elements of this story--and perhaps even more so that it was handed off to several other storytellers who couldn't manage even its initial syllables.<br /><br />This is the Batman movie you were always hoping they would make.  It would probably have been a much bigger hit if it weren't preceded by such bad versions of the same story.<br /><br />They don't overplay Morgan Freeman, get campy with Alfred, or have people falling into vats of radioactive waste and raising armies of crime syndicate costumed flunkies overnight and in record numbers.  The story--the epically dramatic, non-cartoon version--is the star here, and its excellently told without getting overshadowed by big name movie stars.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm thrilled I finally saw this film despite my hard belief I would be horribly disappointed.sappointed.
0765309408|5.0|I can't remember when I last read a book by an author who was previously unknown to me which was this much fun to read.<br /><br />John Scalzi's first book in the Old Man's War universe begins in familiar, near-future settings, allows the reader to bond with his likable main character/narrator, and then rapidly moves out into a universe that nothing like humanity expected.  The aliens are tough, advanced, and none-too-welcoming of human settlers, and a reader does not wait long for the action to begin.  I think Scalzi has excelled at two fundamentals of enjoyable science fiction: plot and character.  Unlike too many of his contemporaries, who seem to feel that the construction of outlandish future scenarios and the accompanying technologies constitute enjoyable reading, Scalzi never allows the props to upstage the actors.  Technologies are in this book in abundance, but they support plot and character, never stealing the show.<br /><br />That said, the book, particularly when followed by the sequel, Ghost Brigades, does manage to move beyond human-centered conquering of bizarre aliens.  In fact, the unanswered question, at least until the third book in the OMW universe is published, is whether humans might even be the bad guys.<br /><br />So, for a rollicking good read that reminds you of why you started liking science fiction in the first place (and even, as a bonus, might make you think), I heartily recommend Old Man's War.
B000I2IT44|5.0|If Steven Wilson were to come up to me and spit in my face, I would continue to buy whatever he puts out there.  My limited edition came to me on Saturday.  I grabbed a 6 pack of Blueberry ale and retreived my smokables and blasted this DVD through my fine stereo system.  This is one of, if not the best live DVD's I have ever seen/heard.  It brought me back to the night last October at the 9:30 club in DC where I witnessed them for the first time.  This DVD was longer than the show I saw.  You can't help but wish it was a double live DVD (the 2nd disc being non-live material).  Even so (or Even Less), the set list is superb and executed to perfection.  The production and mix are stunning.  When RUSH are no longer recording and touring, PT will be my favorite active band, period. <br /> <br />
B000F48CD8|5.0|The Raconteurs is a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.   <br /> <br />Jack White contributes his edgy talent, while Brendan Benson contributes a more melodic talent.  The result is far greater than anything either one could create without the other. <br /> <br />I hear shades of Lennon and McCartney in the Raconteurs.  Granted, most music produced in the past 40 years owes a debt to Lennon and McCartney, but the influence seems more direct on the Raconteurs.  The White-Benson mix reminds me of the \\"edgy-softer\\" mix of Lennon-McCartney.  Strong harmonies and bass lines don't hurt, either. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD.  It is by far the best CD I've purchased this year.  I loved it on the first listen, and it just keeps getting better each time I hear it.
0876852630|5.0|I am sure that by now this book has been thoroughly reviewed by many, many people, and much of what I will say will simply be in tune with the chorus, but I just got done reading Factotum and seeing the movie, both in the same day, and I was completely blown away. <br /> <br />First of all, the movie is very true to the book and Matt Dillon makes an excellent Hank.  The actresses also are good representations of the women in the book.  The major problems I have is that, like it or not, and I think future generations will bear this out more and more, Factotum is a period piece, and should not have been set in the present day.  Also, in the film Jan ends up with the guy that was at the racetrack that day, a conclusion that the book did not draw.  Several other things were skipped over in the movie, which would have moved it into the NC 17 category had they been included, and after reading the book, the movie seems like an extremely sanitized version of the events in the book.   <br /> <br />The book itself: it is a fascinating read.  I am not a very good reader and I do not read even a book a year.  99% of the time I will not get past page 20 in a book and I've quit buying them.  Until Factotum.  Such an easy and entertaining read that I did it in one day.   <br /> <br />Hank is a person who travels around from town to town, job to job, drinks a lot, and has some strange experiences and observations of people.  That is the best synoposis I can offer.  Once you get into his life, into his era, into his urban environment filled with strange and unusual people and circumstances, you don't want to leave.  What is around the next corner?!?!  Also this book, aside from having remarkable insites about the people he is around, is quite humorous.  Probably too sexually explicit for your local university's 20th C. Fiction class, and high school is out of the question.   <br /> <br />I'd rather not say much else about the book lest I ruin it.  See the movie and if it intrigues you as it did me, then read the book.  I can't speak of any other Bukowski novels....yet.
1400079179|2.0|I refused to believe all the hype about this book for a couple of years until just recently I finally picked it up.  Wow.  I was disappointed.  The story itself is provoking and brings up some interesting points, but overall it is a cheaply written thriller.<br /><br />There are much better, more interesting thrillers by Michael Crichton and the likes.  Overall I would compare this book to a cheap action flick, one that causes you to laugh at the shear audacity of many of the scenes, laughing, pointing and saying \\"Hey! That could never happen!\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like books you probably won't like this one.  If you prefer reality TV then you will love this book. Blah.
0767903862|5.0|I took this book with me on a recent trip to Central America and absolutely loved it.  While there is less narrative flow than, say, A Walk in the Woods, reading Bryson's thoughts on Sydney harbor, Australian-rules football, former Prime Minister Harold Holt (peace be upon him), forever walking through Canberra, and his near run-in's with a seemingly endless list of nasty (and apparently deadly) native animals was engaging and thoroughly enjoyable.  He does this all the while encountering some pretty terrific and endearing folks, drinking many Victorian Bitters, and relaying an impressive and affectionate recounting of Australian history.  There really is a lot to like here.  So much so that upon finishing the book while still in Central America, and realizing that I committed the unpardonable sin of only bringing one book with me to read (you try finding a decent bookstore in Central America), I turned to the first chapter and started all over again.  And it was equally engrossing, witty, and informative if not more-so.  I can think of no higher compliment for a book and I recommend it whole-heartedly.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Two Towers picks up where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. Once again you are thrust into the realm of J.R.R. Tolkien with vivid special effects and a compelling story. Any edition that you get you are getting spectacular hobbity goodness, so don't stress too much over it. <br /> <br />Lord of the Rings is quite a concept, originally brought forth by J.R.R. Tolkien decades ago. Unfortunately, his book was 1,137 pages long, which is a daunting read. Thankfully, his book has been brought to the big screen for more of a mainstream approach, and where more people can enjoy it. If nothing else, it is easier to enjoy. <br /> <br />The L.O.T.R. movies are not short by any means, but if the other option is reading over a thousand pages, I choose the movies. Besides, you will probably enjoy yourself so much watching the movies that they will not seem so long. <br /> <br />After this movie, see the final one. It really kicks butt, and it ends well.
B00005JP0A|3.0|Andrea has just graduated from Northwestern and moved to \\"The Big Apple\\" in hopes of landing her dream job as a journalist.  Unfortunately, the only job she can land is at \\"Runway\\" magazine (where everyone dresses and eats like a supermodel) as second assistant to \\"Super B####\\" Editor in Chief, Miranda.  Andrea's Illinois undergrad fashion sense and casual attitude aren't going to get her very far, but if she can make it a year working for the biggest b#### in the business her future is almost insured.  But how far is Andrea willing to go for a reference?<br /><br />This movie screams 'Chick flick,' but surprisingly I really enjoyed it.  Meryl Streep is awesome, as always, and Stanley Tucci is always fun to watch.<br /><br />Overall is it worth the price of a movie ticket?  That's hard to say, because I think movies have really become overpriced, and I'm not sure that any movie is worth it. Personally if I could do it again I would wait for the DVD, but I'm a guy.  My wife gives it 4 stars, I'm giving it 3.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This movie does not offer intense special effects, but it doesn't need any.  It is truly good storytelling based on a book by Stephen King.  If you are the type of person who really loves a good story, and does not mind a bit of darkness and a healthy portion of adversity, give this movie a chance.  Worth buying and watching again and again.  Five stars.
1594481938|4.0|Luckily? Unluckily?  Four would be suicides choose to jump from the same building on the same night.  Thus, spoiling the mood.  They form an unlikely alliance and disfunctional support group, agreeing that if things aren't looking up in a couple weeks they'll jump.<br /><br />This book doesn't glorify or play down suicide, but highlights how badly people need other people to care.  The four characters in this book couldn't be any different, the only thing they have in common is that they are alone.  They book is well written and enjoyable, classic Hornby.  In fact the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is a little too Hornby, and having read his other books I didn't find many surprises in it.  Still, it is worth a read.
B00003CXA2|5.0|If you haven't, see it.  It is worth your time.  Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance and the movie consistently provides something to chew on.  You would never think that a person like Forrest Gump could be involved with so many things in his life, but he is, perhaps oblivious to the significance of it all, but you love him nonetheless.  There is hardship, but Forrest conquers all, and it ends nicely.  You are probably going to want to see this movie again at some point, so buying it may be a good idea.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|...in a good way, of course!  I saw Wicked last week and the incredible songs kept haunting me.  I would walk around humming them, I would sing them while sweeping the floor, I would laugh for no apparent reason and find myself explaining to people some nuance of the show that just re-hit me as funny.  It's a great show and if you can't make it to Broadway to see it then you MUST buy the CD.  Of course, the book is a good way to go too, the music will compliment it all!  The songs are deep, witty, fun, funny, and flawless.  Popular, one of the most popular songs from the musical, is an instant hit.  The depth of Defying Gravity is amazing.  All ages will find themselves mezmerized by this wonderful experience.<br /><br />(and if you CAN see the show - be sure to make it!  It's a blast!)
B00005JKCH|5.0|I was hoping they would come out with Spider-Man on the big screen.  I am a big superhero fan.  Well, the movie eventually did come out and I saw it in the theater.  It did not fall short.  Character development was right on.  You really get the picture that Peter Parker is struggling through life, and then gets these amazing powers that transform his life but do not remove hardship.  With his new powers, he has the added burden to carry.  A crime-fighting superhero is born.  Start here, then see Spider-Man 2.  The story continues...

B00005V331|4.0|Back in the early 80's, Welcome to Hell was an extremely pivotal album. Lars Ulrich of Metallica even stated this album to be the very first thrash release. I hate to agree with that idiot but I agree. It is of course still arguable, but there is no doubt that hits album is the stepping stone to thrash and black/death metal alike.<br /><br />This album of course is the result of three British \\"musicians\\" getting together wanting to make the most in-your-face metal ever created (in the early 80's anyway). It's like they wanted to take what Motorhead started and take it not one, but many steps forward! The band took shockingly evil lyrics and mixed it with loud, heavy, and rather sloppy musicianship! I personally love the results but some people sure won't<br /><br />One reason people may not like this album is because of the major rough production. I personally kind of dig it as it gives the album a unique sound. With Venom's lyrical and image choice, they're actually lucky to get this recorded at all! Most production studies would have frowned on their musical choice so it's a \\"miracle\\" that Welcome to Hell was even recorded!<br /><br />The album kicks off with Sons of Satan, an extremely thrashy track. Right away people new this wasn't your average Motorhead rip-off! These guys were for real! All the songs present on this album have, for lack of a better word, great \\"groove\\" to them that is extremely different than the black metal the band would inspire in the future. What surprising is that even with the albums poor production, many of the songs have very sing-along-able courses! Try listening to Live Like an Angel with singing the course along with Cronos. \\"Live like an angel, die like a devil, got a place in hell reserved for me. Live Like an angel, die like a devil, gonna burn in hell it's where I want to be!\\" Ouch!!<br /><br />Some people slat Venom for not having musical talent, but that is harsh. Sure they may not be the best metal musicians in the genre but they deserve MUCH more credit then they get. First of all the production doesn't help in this case. Listen to some of Venom's later releases such as Prime Evil or Resurrection for proof. Mantas is actually quit a good guitarist and Cronos has a likeable voice that fits this kind of \\"in-your-face\\" metal music perfectly!<br /><br />If you are a metal fan, then Welcome to Hell needs to be in your collection! If you can get past the rough production, than Welcome to Hell may very well be to your liking (especially if you're a thrash nut!).genre but they deserve MUCH more credit then they get.

B000FVQYYK|3.0|This album is sheer power, in its sound, in its attack, in its creativity. <br />That said, I have some major problems with it.  The hooks don't stand, there are too many throwaways, the songwriting seems somewhat lost.  The Muse are so focused on the attack and the power that they've lost the ability to write good songs in the proccess.  If you were to play these songs acoustically, they simply, this album would suck. <br />Of course, one would argue that these songs aren't meant to be acoustic, and that is true.  This album is less about the tunes and more about the full-body breathtaking sound, but whilst this would be okay for a metal band or avant garde band, this does not work for the Muse, who write their songs in pop construction. <br />I am disappointed because in this album I find a unique, even innovative sound which I saw hinted in prior bands, but never developed like the Muse.  The sound is so good, so heavenly, so powerful, that I can't help but liking a lot of songs here, and the album as a whole is certainly an experience.  This is the sort of sound which demands for great songs.  This album has no great songs (except perhaps Knights of Cydonia).  The songs seem to be crying out for greatness, but in the end, they are just okay, and that is why this album is not great. <br />Listen to it for the experience, but don't expect the masterpiece that people are raving about.
0393327655|5.0|The end of faith is a smart, well documented,insightful book on the damages created by religions from the beggining of history. <br />It guides the readers through the horrors perpetuated by the followers of Mahomet,as well as the follies of christians killing others in the name of GOD. <br />This book also broches the subject of spirituality as a biologic component of the human brain. <br />It is the most fascinatic book. A call for REASON to take over before religion destroys our societies .

6300184269|5.0|Why oh why did I buy this on VHS? This is a movie that you would watch more than once. Bras on their heads, that's classic! Where did they get the bras? This movie is about 2 computer nerds who invent a woman on their computer. And yes, bust size was included. They go out in public with her to show her off to everybody. A funny movie but the plot was not all that. Then again this was made in the 80's. It's funny to see Anthony Michael Hall as a geeky teen in this film. And now as grown up Johnny Smith in The Dead ZOne.

B000GPIPD8|5.0|I have to admit! These guys are redefining what can be done with just a guitar and drums in Rock & Roll.These guys sound like a Two piece Led Zepplin with a Strong Mississippi Hill Country sound and feel like Jr. Kimbrough! With the Exception of the first CD, \\"The Big Come Up\\", This is their BEST CD to Date! Heavyweight Two piece Blues Based ROCK!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Finally, John Mayer has realized that he has the potential to utilize his great talents even moreso than he has been.  Sure, such a potent Grammy winning number as \\"Daughters\\" is a song that might never be forgotten in music history, but CONTINUUM I believe maybe the truest and quite possible the first TRUE John Mayer album that we've heard.  The material here as well as the overall sound and timbre easily trumps a majority of Mayer's earlier and previously best material.  I am glad to see the virtuostic Mayer (where his guitar chops are concerned) actually embrace the blues-side of rock and venture out in a direction that showcases that bluesy-soulful influence.  If nothing else, Mayer's CONTINUUM is easily Mayer's most soulful LP.<br /><br />The album opens up with the simple enough, but brilliantly simple \\"Waiting For The World To Change\\".  Unfortunate for the PROMO single is that radio didn't give it the respect that it should've.  It is a very nice track and it is one that is tuneful enough that it sticks when you listen to it.  What is most admirable and loveable is the soulfulness that pours from this track, almost a newfound soulfulness or a complete rejuvenation of Mayer that ditches \\"Clarity\\" or \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" for Hendrix, Buddy Guy, B.B. King influenced blues rock.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\\" is a second consistent number, keeping up the idea of minimalist soulful arrangements coupled with Mayer's awesome, virtuostic guitar playing.  Something else key here is that Mayer's vocals sound as mature as ever, not to say that he didn't on HEAVIER THINGS (a very good album, not knocking it), but it is a new found maturity, which was foreshadowed by the TRY! which was a project featuring Mayer's newly formed trio, who are featured on CONTINUUM as well.<br /><br />\\"Belief\\" is yet another strong track.  What makes it so cool besides it's driving soulful-rhythmic feel is the booming bass line that is so often \\"underwhelmed\\" in adult-alternative music. Here, Mayer has the bass line turned up with a \\"booming\\" sound that is perfect for this track.  What may even make Mayer's vocal performance stronger here is his subtlety and his use of instrumental breaks in between the verse and the chorus as well as in between parts of the verse.<br /><br />\\"Gravity\\" sounds like it should be featured on say an Anthony Hamilton album or a B.B. King album.  The opening guitar solo in the 6 feel is just immaculate. This is yet another 5 star number of 2006, perhaps one of the most touching tracks here.  The organ is subtle in the background, but it serves its purpose ten-fold.  The songwriting here is as it has been through the entirety of the album-- way above par and above the par that great songwriter Mayer has previously set for himself in the past.<br /><br />\\"The Heart Of Life\\" speeds the tempo back up again after the chilling \\"Gravity\\".  This track spans more than adult-alternative, and is a track that would sound nearly equally at home on say a Sufjan Stevens album or a country-rock folk album. The guitar sounds great here and yet again John Mayer doesn't disappoint, even if you expect him to after 5 straight great, consistent numbers.<br /><br />\\"Vultures\\" returns a rhythmic groove back to continnum.  The sound here is a mix of a classic soul groove and an overall soulful blues-rock arragement.  I personally love the sound of Mayer's vocals here as well as the semi-polytonal element of the rhythmic guitar coupled with Mayer's guitar improvisations and riffs. This track is a masterwork of \\"in the pocket\\" rhythm section playing and it is just another phenomenal track.<br /><br />\\"Stop This Train\\" is in the same plane as \\"The Heart Of Life\\", only there is a slight bit more rhythmic support on the bottom with a very supportive bass line at the bottom of the arrangement.  The songwriting here is again great and the chord progression is perfect.  I love and \\"heart\\" the folk feel and the hearkening to go back to the simpler times of acoustic music and the earthy feel of tracks such as these.<br /><br />\\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\\" is personally one of my very favorite tracks here.  While all the tracks on this album are great, this one just has the soulfulness that I've been hoping that Mayer would always pull out.  It was like I felt Mayer was so close with numbers such as \\"Daughters\\" and \\"Come Back To Bed\\", but the soufulness that oozes here is phenomenal.  The guitar sound is great and reminds me of listening to Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, B.B. or any of the great Blues artists.<br /><br />While \\"Bold As Love\\" isn't my favorite, it is very ambitious that Mayer did a Hendrix cover.  \\"Dreaming With A Broken Heart\\", starts out with an incredibly tender melodic piano line as well as somber lyrics and vocals by Mayer.  This is among the tender and most plaintive sounding I've heard Mayer... another winning and enthralling vocal performance that starts out slowly and picks up more and more momentum as the song progresses. Another one of my favorites.<br /><br />The introductory organ in \\"In Repair\\" again marks the maturity of Mayer with CONTINUUM.  His sense of what \\"real music\\" should represent is made so clear on this album which deserves Grammy nominations! This time you just feel that Mayer got it right with the chilling melodic vocal lines, the exceptional guitar work coupled with everything else.  He ends on a high note with \\"I'm Gonna Gind Another You\\", which begins with Mayer's soulful chops only accompanied by a bluesy electric guitar.  Again, the feel is in six and gradually horns, drums, and organ are added to the mix.  It is absolutely chilling and enthralling to listen to.  This is the first Mayer album for me that I am able to listen to without stopping... it is THAT GOOD.<br /><br />The production here is first rate as is both Mayer's songwriting and his vocals.  The guitar playing was always there, but maybe because everything else is so great here it sounds that much better and that much stronger.  For me, Mayer has made perhaps one of the VERY best albums of 2006.  I would love, as I've already said, to see Mayer snatch Grammys for this wonderful and exciting music experience. 4.5 stars!!!rkening to go back to the simpler times of acoustic music and the earthy feel of tracks such as these.  <br /> <br />\\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\\" is personally one of my very favorite tracks here.

B000H305U0|1.0|If you like someone sounding total monotone and stuggling to sound black, then you might like this. If you like clean cut music, music with more than a note or two ~~ forget it.  And definitely don't watch him performing the new song live - he is grabbing at his crotch every two seconds.  No class.
B000H305U0|4.0|Coming into his sophomore album, Justin Timberlake had a lot to live up to.  He had a ubiquitous hit with the incredibly catchy \\"Cry Me A River\\" and in 2002 he was undoubtedly the male-sex symbol.  You had to wonder after 4 years if the Grammy winning Pop-Urban artist had it in him to come back with an album that could even touch the greatness of JUSTIFIED.  The answer is, he did return with an album that could \\"touch\\" the greatness of JUSTIFIED, yet it isn't better than the solo set that brought the former N*Sync standout to multiplatinum solo success.  Will FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS be a hit?  Definitely! The question now is will Justin be the chart-topper or the bridesmaid against chart-topper John Mayer?  Only the Billboard Charts will reveal!<br /><br />Even though FUTURESEX is one of the fresher pop-urban efforts of 2006 (following the exceptional Timbo-Nelly collab creating LOOSE), it still has its flaws.  Some material tends to be insurbordinate in quality compared to the rest.  What is also strange is the fact that Timberlake claimed he wanted FUTURESEX to sound more like a rock singer as opposed to an urban-R&B performer.  To me, aside from a few David Bowie-ish new wave sounding Prince influenced tracks, JT sounds as urban as ever.  Personally, I was concerned that the new album wouldn't be urban enough as I feel that JT is suited to be singing pop music that edges R&B, just as the phenomenal Christina Aguilera should as well.<br /><br />Despite a few logistical oddities, FUTURESEX is ultimately worth the lengthy wait in between JUSTIFIED.  The production that is covered mostly by Timbaland is phenomenal; the general rule is that if it is a \\"Timbo\\" production, then it is prone to be exceptional.  The album opens up excitingly with the \\"Rock-singer\\" feel of the electro-heavy \\"Futuresex/Lovesound\\".  The \\"chrome\\" production is ultra-slick and makes for a very exciting listen.  The drums are as engaging as Timberlake's incredibly seductive-sexy vocals here. The chorus certainly grabs the listener for a surprise after a certain sense of minimalism is explored throughout the verse. The track is followed-up by the ubiquitous #1 hit (the first for Timberlake on the Billboard 100), \\"SexyBack\\", a hit both loved and hated by fans.  I personally think that it is ambitious, if nothing else.  Perhaps what makes it more interesting is the fact that it is the first track we've ever heard Justin Timberlake say \\"the motherf**kers don't know how to act\\", certainly a line aiming at JT shedding off any of his tween-appeal of his N*Sync days.<br /><br />\\"Sexy Ladies\\" certainly has more cool production by Timbaland, yet it isn't quite as potent as \\"FutureSex/LoveSound\\" or \\"Sexy Back\\".  However, it isn't truly bad in anyway and it still has you bobbing your head.  The better track just my be my favorite of the album, the exceptional \\"My Love\\" feat. T.I. The production is perhaps the coolest that I've heard Timbaland do; it is just perfect!  JT's vocals sound their very best here and in my opinion, this is one of the few 5 star ratings I'd give to a track.  It is just hip and I keep pressing the rewind button to listen to it.  T.I. sounds fine here, but it is Justin who is the true star here, as it should be.<br /><br />\\"Lovestoned\\" is OK, but it isn't the best track. Again, the production is busy with the genius of Timberland at the helm.  However, it is still strange to hear JT curse knowing he was in N*Sync when he says: \\"she's got a little more a**\\".  The Asian sound of \\"What Goes Around\\" with the strings coupled with it makes for another production masterpiece, if not say a hit that stands against the strongest material of the album. Again, there is no track here that is truly below average; most stand on their own and tend to be above average.  \\"Chop Me Up\\" is an obvious urban-leaning track, no matter what JT says.<br /><br />\\"Chop Me Up\\" is track that shouldn't be a hip as it is.  Who would've thought that JT would be hanging with Three-6Mafia?  However, Justin sounds as gangsta as ever here and hangs well with the \\"Stay Fly\\" guys.  The production here is exceptional and has a very pronounced hip-hop sound. \\"Damn Girl\\" features the great production work of nobody else by Black-Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am with his creative sense of drums, soulful snippets, and tracks that are fantastic for the club.  \\"Damn Girl\\" isn't my favorite track, but it isn't terrible either, even if the phrase \\"damn girl\\" is repeated a few \\"damn\\" too many times for my tastes.<br /><br />\\"Summer Love\\" returns with more fresh production and a driving groove that you can't deny. \\"Until The End of Time\\" easily returns Timberlake to his urban \\"roots\\" (as if he ever really left them behind on this album).  \\"Losing My Way\\" is a fine enough track, though it seems a bit \\"too big\\" in a sense.  Timberlake makes up for any flaws with the exceptional closer \\"(Another Song) All Over Again\\", one of Timberlake's best ballads easy.<br /><br />So, no FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS isn't the second coming nor is it necessarily better than JUSTIFIED, but it is an ambitious album that does deliver for the most part with a couple of minor-flawed moments.  However, I don't think that that could hurt Timberlake, considering that maybe he really is bringing \\"SexyBack\\". 3.5 - 4 stars for FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS.with Three-6 Mafia?

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Welcome back Mr. Mayer. GREAT set of tunes more blue-sy than the pop-ish sound of his first album. The song-writing is incredible. If you were fan before go get it now, trust me on this one! The best songs are (1) Waiting On The World To Change the current uptempo single, (5) The Heart of Life VERY GOOD, simple, beautiful melody of seeing the bigger picture after something horrible goes wrong. (7) Stop This Train the heartfelt fear of life passing you by, (10) Dreaming With a Broken Heart the emptiness of your soul after loosing a love in your life, (12) Im Gonna Find Another You. soulful, blues guitar navigates you through a sincere love falling apart and bitterness settling in. Slow Dancing In A burning Room (8) has a haunting guitar riff that you will never get out of your head... its just a really sexy tune. These are only the great songs much of the rest of the album is very good and holds its own including a cover of Hendrixs Bold as Love. Overall its a somber, slower-paced album. 5 out of 5. <br /> <br />
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|One of the biggest surprises for me actually this year in terms of music. I mean we had some great offerings like Christina's Back to Basics, Nelly Furtado's Loose, and John Mayer's Continuum(also include India Arie, Mary J Blige, and Bob Dylan). And then we had some disappointments like Beyonce's BDay (come on now and JT -to his fans- is not impressing me either with \\"Sexyback\\"). And in terms of new artists the only ones that I had liked was Natasha Bedingfield, Chris Brown (my adolescent relatives got me hooked on that), and Carrie Underwood (yeah you read it!). The reason I'm throwing out names is because Rihanna the artist behind \\"Pon De Replay\\" was the last person recently I expected to make a good album, because in some cases I was right before (Ciara being an example for me). But in Rihanna's case I totally misjudged and was glad to have listened to the album. What I love most is the variety of songs in terms of genre (rock, pop, hip/hop, island, r&b). You'd think after listening to \\"SOS\\" it would sound all alike and then you're hit with the next two tracks sounding so different and yet good. This was not something you would expect considering her first island-dance album that failed to hit platinum. The album's production is very polished (another surprise) and enjoyable. Now Rihanna isn't the best singer but she knows her limits and tries to stay within them (unlike some artists who I will not name). I'd recommend it but it isn't for everybody. But it is fun and entertaining music.
B000H305U0|5.0|I've been a fan of Justin every since he broke away from the ties that were holding him down and shone on his own with his debut `Justified', but with his sophomore effort Justin ventures even further away from his boy band roots and gives us a diverse and enjoyable album and by the end of this album we see Justin truly come into his own.  From the competent beats that Timbaland laces every track with to Justin's signature falsetto coupled with undeniably catchy hooks `FutureSex/LoveSounds' delivers on every front and will leave the listener completely satisfied. <br /> <br />Starting off with `Futuresex/Lovesound' Justin immediately wets our appetite with an ample offering oozing forth with atmosphere and sexy energy we hadn't seen on his previous album.  His voice is also much sultrier on this song, keeping far away from his falsetto and singing every line with this breathy grown voice.  This song is so sexually charged it's addictive and the lyrics are so far from his boy band days your forced to take a double take.  <br /> <br />And then of course we have `Sexyback' which has become one of the most addicting songs I've ever heard.  When my wife and I first heard this song we weren't completely sold, but after hearing it a few times I am a complete fan.  The electronic take on his voice is interesting and entrancing almost, but it's Timbaland's infectious beat that keeps this track on constant replay in my CD player.  The dirty lyrics and almost creepy sexuality in Justin's voice only add to the guilt factor to loving this song and that makes it all the more addicting. <br /> <br />Now I'm not a huge fan of `Sexy Ladies'.  The beat to me is a bit dry, and Justin comes off so cocksure it's almost funny.  It's not utterly terrible, but it's just a bit lame.  Now what's not late is the prelude `Let me talk to you' which is tagged to the end of this track where Timbaland and Timberlake trade verses over a chopped up version of the `My Love' beat. <br /> <br />That'sleads us into the second single off the album, `My Love' featuring T.I. which is burning up the clubs and radio stations right now.  The track is the first on the album where Timberlake falls back into his style off `Justified', giving us the smooth falsetto and charisma that glistened on almost every track.  The beat here is brilliant and perfectly compliments Justin's tone.  The lyrics are a fall back a bit to the boy band days, but what sets this apart is the sick production and the confidence in Justin's voice that lifts him above most artists working today. <br /> <br />`Lovestoned' seems to be a fan favorite.  The beat is fresh and funky, but Justin really elevates this track above the rest with his sheer confidence that laces his voice with every word uttered.  He believes every word and you do too.  I really love the interlude `I think she knows', which totally remixes the beat adding some Linkin Park elements to it, and Justin's voice really shines here, taking full control of the track and proving that Justin isn't just a sex symbol but he is a truly talented artist. <br /> <br />`What Goes Around Comes Back Around' is a great track, with an interesting Asian twist on the beat, soft lyrics that just give this laid back vibe that reminds me of the feeling I had when listening to `Cry Me A River' for the first time.  The interlude which is more like a continuation of this track where the beat gets a bit jazzed up but the same laid back flow is held in tack and Justin really shows he's got enough silk in his flow to hang with the best of them. <br /> <br />Now I've read some reviews saying that `Chop Me Up' was really just a showcase for Timbaland and Three 6 Mafia where Timberlake just sings hook, but that's not the way I see it.  The whole first half of the track is Timberlake slinging straight laced silky lyrics over Timbaland's tight beats, and then Timbaland takes over for the second verse before Three 6 comes in and closes the house down.  Despite whatyou may think, this is Justin's track for he far outshines the guest vocalists.  The one thing that makes Three 6's part stand apart though is the switch in the beat which takes a turn for the better so I can see how it would stand apart, but it doesn't take over. <br /> <br />I think that Timberlake's first collaboration with Black Eyed Peas was a great call, giving Justin some cred in the urban community and giving the Black Eyed Peas their first real hit.  That said I'm not to keen on `Damn Girl' featuring BEP frontman Will.i.am.  The whole feel of the track is a bit forced to me, and Will.i.am's rap at the end takes away from track to me (that is to say that I really don't like it).  That and the vocals on the track seem to be staticy and it just feels like the production isn't clean. <br /> <br />Love `Summer Love'...it's just an all around great track and great redemption after the last track.  Justin spits flow a lot faster than average on this track borderline hip hop flow and really shows how he's improved in his delivery since his N*Sync days.  The beat and production is all top notch.  The prelude `Set the Mood' really turns things down and gets us prepared for the slowest track on the album. <br /> <br />`Until the End of Time' is a bit corny but it does deliver in the vocal department.  No matter what Justin is singing, no matter how cliché the words may be his delivery is as smooth and silky as can be that it almost doesn't matter.  Especially when he varies his vocal range towards the end of the track during the \\"you got me sayin' oh\\".   <br /> <br />Justin tackles deeper subjects on `Losing My Way' trying to show he's more than just a Casanova.  It's not the worst way to handle the subject of drug abuse and throwing your life away, and while some have mentioned the simple almost corny lyrics you have to admit that it's no worse than everything else out there right now.  The track doesn't seem so strong in the beginning but by the end it really breaks into its own and really shines as the chorus is taken over by a choir and Justin shouts backup. <br /> <br />`All Over Again' was actually one of the first songs I heard off the album.  I downloaded this track about a month ago and fell in love with it.  It actually has a very John Mayer vibe to it, laid back and elegant, and Justin's voice carries so well over the piano and sounds like he belongs in a jazz club crooning for all of us to enjoy.  This is the rawest track here and it really shows the grace in his voice, letting it crack when it needs to, adding amounts of humanity and sincerity in his lyrics. <br /> <br />The bonus track is just that, a bonus track.  `Pose' isn't the worst song (better than `Damn Girl') and it's elevated by the appearance of Snoop Dogg, but it's definitely a few notches below the best on this album.   <br /> <br />The album as a whole is polished and consistently impressive.  Justin has grown since his N*Sync days, and even then some from his debut.  Anyone doubting Justin's staying power will be silenced after hearing this album, and rightfully so.  Justin proves that he's much more than a pretty boy for he has the pipes and the ambition to be one of the greatest music acts working today.  I really never thought I'd every say that about Mr. Timberlake, but even I need to give credit where credit is due.  I expected to enjoy this album, but I never expected to love it.  I have a feeling that Justin is the future of our music, and if that's the case then our future looks pretty good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is by far one of the shows that has been on Television and is well worth seeing, despite it's short run. Covering the adventures of nine travelers on the free trader Serenity, this show managed to combine elements of Science Fiction, Westerns and Criminal Heist shows in to one glorious blend.  <br /> <br />This show has the incredible dialog that is the hallmark of any Whedon production managing to be both funny and very real. The show also has some beautifull set and costume design that does a an excellent job of conjuring a realistic but futuristic world. Add in superb acting, strong special effects and intense action sequences and you have a recipe for a show that should have lasted longer then half a season.
0307346609|3.0|There's good news and bad news about this book.  The good news is that the scenario is an interesting one (worldwide zombie outbreak) handled in a style that is fresh and new when brought to this material (more techno-thriller than the typical first-person-shooter / horror treatment that zombie themes get in movies).<br /><br />The bad news is that the author has a lot of left-wing political baggage that he insists on unloading in various inappropriate ways.  Examples are numerous, and include: an evil pharmaceutical CEO who giggles (yes, literally, giggles) evilly at the recollection that his firm sold worthless vaccine with the help of the [ Republican ] administration, a wish-fulfillment scenario wherein the Israelis and Palestinians come together and live as one peacefully and without any of the \\"Kill the Jew behind the tree\\" politics from the real world, a castigation of the current occupants of the white-house for having made Americans sick of war (and thus delaying their effective response to the zombie menace), etc., etc., etc. ad nauseum.<br /><br />There are also a few clunky bits of writing, mixed in with the good.  Because the author has chosen the first person singular voice of veterans of the zombie war as his means of telling the story, there are various plot bits which don't quite fit in.  Example: say that you've got a character who hallucinated certain things...and you want to make it clear to the reader that these are hallucinations.  In third person storytelling, you can just mention it...but in first person, you have to have the character basically spell out the reasons you should disbelieve what you're hearing...which is extremely ineffective, and destroys suspension of disbelief as one pauses to marvel at the clunkiness of the mechanism.<br /><br />All in all, worth reading.  If you're a conservative or a libertarian of certain stripes, the politics will grate on you a bit at first (but those sins are mostly contained in the first 1/3 of the book), and if you're left of center, you'll perhaps find the politics an added bonus.of the book), and if you're left of center, you'll perhaps find the politics an added bonus.

People like Mr. Williamson need to be reminded to keep their opions to themselves, when they don't have a clue what they are talking about. This album is phenomenal!!

B000H7JD4A|5.0|I can't explain this with words... it's simply a masterpiece! All songs are great and no fillers in the album. The solos are stunning, very creative, very experimental and powerful. My friends: please listen to this record and buy it without hesitate, it is simply great music, very Maiden! I've always had problems deciding wich Maiden album is my favorite because I love all of them, but I have to admit that Number of the Beast, Seventh Son and Powerslave are just terrific. Well, now I have to add my fourth all time favourite: A Matter of Life And Death. It has everything I like from Maiden, so for me it's just perfect. Cheers.
B000H305U0|3.0|Perhaps I'm just being a bit picky, but after a solid debut--and too damn long a wait for album #2--by this artist, I expected more.  This album, while good, does not live up to the standard set by it's predecessor...or it's title.  What could have been a great, sexy, all-dance, album starts out well enough, but is marred by the heavy rap of \\"Chop Me Up\\" and preludes/interludes which aren't necessary, slow down the overall flow of the album, as well as a couple of ballads that are nicely sung yet come across as insincere.  The title track is great and flows smoothly into first single \\"SexyBack\\", worthy of it's hit status; another choice song is \\"Lovestoned\\", likely to be the next single, another smooth, midtempo mix of pop-tronica gone wild.  Justin wrote or co-wrote nearly every track on this album, which is impressive for someone who's only 25 and yet, there are too many others involved in the production of what should've been a great, unique, truly sexy sophomore CD.  If you bought this album from Best Buy, you'll be treated to a bonus track featuring Snoop Dogg, \\"Pose\\", which is a fantastic hip-pop confection unlike some of the album's other tracks.  Overall, a good CD, worth picking up; but hopefully Justin's third album will succeed where this one failed...and not take so long to be released, either.
0385335989|4.0|This book started very slow and did a lot of rambling with Brianna and Roger's relationship. Roger was a pretty uptight and too tightly strung most of the time but likeable. I found Brianna to be very immature and self centered.  Rather dumb too in some respects concerning almost inviting herself to be raped.  What did she think Bonnet was talking about in the tavern when it was apparent that he thought she was a prostitute?  For a supposedly knowledgeable woman of the late 1960's she still goes on board his ship knowing how women were treated in the 1700's after months of research on that era.  Pretty farfetched.  Then she is entirely too keen on slapping, punching and generally thinking it is okay to tear into Roger, Ian or anyone else that crosses her including threatening blackmail to get her way with John Grey.  This book does not put her in a very good light.  She becomes more likeable and matures into an interesting woman in later books, thankfully, as she is an important character from this book forward.  <br /> <br />I was touched by Brianna's initial meeting with Jamie but wasn't too thrilled with his really horrible handling of her in such a rough way when he was \\"convincing\\" her in the stable that she could not have prevented her rape by fighting back.  Obviously, fainting was a terrible fright in all of Gabaldon's books but manhandling a woman in early pregnancy was not a concern by Brianna's father of miscarriage?  One of the few times I found Gabaldon's portrayl of Jamie a bit much.  <br /> <br />I did enjoy the details of the settling of Frazer's mountain and general info of early days in N. Carolina.  Ian is certainly an interesting character and was glad to see him appear in subsequent books of this series. <br /> <br />If you enjoy history, some romance, general mayhem and often times harrowing experience, you will enjoy this book.  I find Gabaldon to have a very enjoyable sense of humor in most of the books and found myself smiling at many thingsI read.

B00005JPBD|5.0|Pedro Almodóvar, the king of Spanish cinema is back with Volver, a film with a lot of humor, but also the finest drama.  <br />The story, written by Almodóvar himself, is original and has great twists and surprises for you to enjoy. <br /> <br />The story in short without any spoilers: <br />Raimunda (Penélope Cruz) is a young mother and together with her sister Sole (played by Lola Dueñas) who has an illegal barbershop, they always clean their mother and father's grave, who have passed away long ago. They both have their own problems, and Raimunda experienceses a big one together with her daughter Paula (played by Yohana Cobo),which I'm not gonna tell, you'll see. <br />But then, suddenly, the mother (played by Carmen Maura) returns from her grave as a spirit, because she has some unfinished business to complete before she can rest in peace. So with their mother walking around, some big problems here, and some little problems there, Volver is a delighted comedy and drama at the same time that will entertain you endlessly! <br /> <br />Penélope Cruz is absolutely fantastic in this film. The problem with her acting in Hollywood is that she can never really show that she can really act because of the language that doesn't come out as fluently as Spanish (Not that she is terrible when she acts in English, she is a wonderfull actress, but still, you don't feel like it is her 100% because of the language barriar). Now, in her own language, Penélope shows she can really act and steals the show. She really gave me goosbumps in some of her scenes because she can act emotionally very realisticly which absolutely grabbed me. Expect acting from the highest level! <br />The rest of the cast is also fantastic and they all act great. It is an absolute star cast where nobody is out of place or not good: maqnificent job! <br /> <br />Even though the film is completely spoken in Spanish, you'll have no problem getting into this film. When the first scene appeared on the screen, I was so into it, that I was not even noticing that I was still reading the subtitles. And thats the power of the Spanish cinema. Volver shows how great Spanish movies can be. It is a fantastic film that will make you laugh, cry and entertain you till the very end. <br /> <br />I don't know how it will go with you, but after seeying this film in the cinema, I can offically say that I am sold to the Spanish cinema: Mucho Gracias! <br />So I will probally Volver (return) to the cinema for more Spanish delight in the future!  <br /> <br />Enjoy and Let yourself be grabbed by the story, the emotion, the comedy and the acting: entertainment from the highest sort. So go and see this, cause it will be in your mind for some time!

0375703764|5.0|Let me say up front that this book didn't freak me out, give me nightmares, or any of the other stuff that people claim. However, by comparison to other horror novels that I've read, House of Leaves is very effective. <br /> <br />Although thrills and chills can be more effectively delivered on film, House of Leaves proves that it can be done on paper too. However, the book doesn't do it through outright gore; in fact, I don't recall a gorey thing about the book (except maybe the very graphic play-by-plays of Johnny Truant's sexual encounters). Instead, the book causes you to question things and sometimes leaves you feeling empty---as empty as the house's black hallways. <br /> <br />The book tells two main storylines. One is Johnny's; Johnny stumbled upon this review written by a man named Zampano after Zampano dies. The review (not a starred, magazine-type thing, mind you) is of a documentary called The Navidson Record, which follows Will and Karen Navidson's move into a new home in Virginia with their two children. That is the other storyline. <br /> <br />Over time, they come to notice that the house's internal dimensions are actually larger than the external ones. After that, Will and Karen discover a hallway in their bedroom that was not there before. Then a closet appears in their living room. This closet is smooth, completely black, unlit, and changes dimensions as it pleases. <br /> <br />That's where things start going awry. Will develops this perverse need to explore it, and things that happen in this story are often mirrored in Johnny's, causing Johnny to go crazy. <br /> <br />The layout of the book relects things that go on in the book as well. In a chapter where Zampano likens the house to a labyrinth as Will and some hired help explore it, the text goes up, down, sideways, and backwards to mirror it. Fewer words will be put on a page to quicken the pace, or they'll be spread out very far. Sometimes it will be condensed into small boxes or at the bottom or top of a page to create a certain feeling, sometimes mirroring a character's feelings. <br /> <br />This book is horror, yes, but it's a love story, too. The house tests Will and Karen's love (and some others), and there's also the love between Johnny and his mother, Pelafina, whose story is told through Johnny and letters in the appendix from Pelafina. <br /> <br />I found the ending of Will and Karen's story a bit sappy, but then again, it's been a while since horror has had a happy ending. My friend, who I lent the book too, enjoyed the ending more than I did, though, so it may vary from person to person. <br /> <br />Johnny's ending isn't that great either, but I think the horror of the book and the pace and plot events of its meaty middle section are what stick with people more. Besides, the book doesn't \\"really\\" end for those who want to reanalyze and interpret the book fully. <br /> <br />Seriously, the greatest thing about this book, and what has made it such a cult classic, is that it is very open to interpretation, some of them hinted at explicitly in the book, other subtley, and a lot of open space as well. Johnny tells us upfront that he's a compulsive liar---is this entire book no different? Did he make it up? Is it just a letter? Did asylum-bound Pelafina write it? <br /> <br />To take it all in requires multiple readings, and even then there's still so much more to discover. You flip the last page and think, \\"wow!\\" <br /> <br />In any case, the most concise review I can write about this is that it's the best horror novel I've ever read, and it's a book that'll beg you to read and reread it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I didn't watch \\"Lost\\" on TV but picked up the DVD sets to watch at my leisure. As one viewer commented here, I think it would have been pretty frustrating to watch this on TV as there were times when I was also frustrated with the DVD, since I didn't have enough time to watch the episodes, one after another.  <br /> <br />It's a very addictive show and once you start watching, it's hard to stop viewing the episodes until it's either time to sleep or do some other activity. As someone already commented here, it's like an extraordinarily long novel which focuses on a lot of detail, as the characters continue to get fleshed out through flashbacks and their actions on the island, with each of the main characters getting ample time on the screen to relive their own stories for us. <br /> <br />I think what's really fascinating about the series is its honesty and the way the characters are portrayed - with everything bared for the audience to see, something that you rarely see in most shows, which are quite shallow and don't focus so much on the characters as what activity they are engaged in. This style of filming lends an incredible depth to the overall production, which otherwise would suffer both in terms of the credibility of the actors and the situations they find themselves in, which are incredible, mysterious and totally unexpected, as there is a twist and turn with every step they make on the island. <br /> <br />As expected, some characters are well liked and there are others whom you really can't relate to or are just plain unlikable, like the cop played by Rodriguez. From the very first scene she's on, you hate her and her entire personality as she doesn't have even one ounce of credibility in her actions or portrayal. She's an extremely poor actress and I'm surprised they cast her. Sawyer, on the other hand, is a rogue and a really bad person but you can't wait to see him in the next episode, to hear what he has to say and overall, although he's a horrible guy, I think everyone likes him for that. He's one of the best characters in the series, apart from Locke, who's mysterious and driven by his inner demons. I didn't like Locke too much in Season 2 but in Season 1, as the hunter and provider, he was great. Jack seems too hyper in every scene and I do like Kate a lot. She brings a certain sauve coolness and is a perfect counter balance to Sawyer. Mr. Eko is a great character and I do hope they have something fantastic in Season 3 for him. I have always hated Michael's character, a one track shallow dad who's pinning all his failures on a professed devotion to his boy, whom he barely knows and can't be a father too as well. Ultimately, he turns out to be a murderer - a terrible, despicable man with no morals, none at all. Last, Jin and Sun are great characters. I don't care too much for the Charlie / Claire relationship and I think it would have been better for the show to have had Charlie killed off and have had Boone stay on.
B00004VVND|4.0|My new year's resolution was to see a bunch of movies I'd always intended to see but continually seemed to miss.  Somewhat belatedly I'm fulfilling my resolution, which is why I finally saw WESTWORLD.  Although it was somewhat dated, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  The film concerns Delos, a resort of the future that allows guests to visit either of three theme parks where behavior that is frowned upon in the modern world can be engaged in without repercussion.  Guests engage in orgiastic sex, feasting and heavy drinking, and the killing of opponents just for the sheer fun of it.  One can choose between doing this in Roman World, Medieval World, or Westworld.  The film focuses primarily on two visitors to Westworld, played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin.  This was one of the last Sci-fi films made before the onset of the personal computer, yet one of the first to actually utilize computers in the making of it.  According to one book I recently read, the CGI representing the vision field of the The Gunslinger robot was the first use of computers to generate images in film history.  So, in this way it could be considered cutting edge.  On the other hand, when things start going wrong with a number of the robots, the head of technology on Delos describes the ailment as a \\"disease.\\"  Today we'd obviously describe this as a virus in their software.<br /><br />\\"Westworld\\" is clearly the stock Warner Brothers Western set that was used at approximately the same time by BLAZING SADDLES.  This works well for the film for it gives the viewer an image that seems weirdly familiar (though understandably familiar, since it has been used in dozens of movies and hundreds of television episodes).  So the visitors to the park get pretty much the Western experience prior media would have conditioned them to expect.  Even the bad guys seem familiar.  Yul Bryner, for instance, wears the exactly same outfit that he wore when he starred in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  The visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer.  They visit the local brothel, kill the robot played by Yul Bryner a couple of times, get arrested and break out of jail and shoot the sheriff, and get drunk in the middle of a huge brawl.  Then things go wrong on a major scale, with the robots going on a killing spree.  The highpoint of the film is the long chase of Richard Benjamin by Yul Bryner.<br /><br />A remake of WESTWORLD is currently in development.  I am normally opposed to remakes.  For the most part remakes are pale imitations of the originals, even in the case of most Sci-fi films.  The remakes of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were inferior to the original, while the original PLANET OF THE APES is vastly superior to the remake.  But this is one instance where, if done correctly, a remake could improve upon the original.  The film is well done, but it was made well before computers came to dominate cultural life.  As a result, the computerized control room looks absurdly primitive.  For instance, there are no keyboards, but only consoles with buttons and switches and knobs.  The danger, of course, is going overboard with the special effects.  The temptation all too often is to go overboard with CGI and spectacular effects; in such cases story is sacrificed for spectacle.  My hope is that they will keep this under control and keep enhancements at a minimum.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very enjoyable and different Sci-fi film.  It was directed and written by Michael Crichton and I couldn't help but think throughout it how similar the overall premise was to another Crichton creation:  JURASSAIC PARK.  Both deal with things going wrong at technologically advanced theme parks.  Substitute dinosaurs for robots or vice versa and you have essentially the same movie.visitors quickly fall into the routine, James Brolin doing an obvious imitation of Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin quickly breaking out of the mold of somewhat nerdy lawyer.

B000HC2LIK|4.0|After reading this short review, please read on. The other reviewers will tell you some info that might be useful to you.<br /><br />My review is short for two reasons: 1) Blade Runner is one great movie, despite the fact that this Director's Edition might not be your cup of tea. After all, the original - uncut - version is better because of (amongst other reasons or opinions) the consistency in the storyline. Nevertheless, this version is one for the people that have a weak spot for some movie titles and want a complete collection. 2) The great image quality, no doubt about that. It blasts any earlier version away and that makes it worth the price.<br /><br />I would have rated this new DVD version five stars if the same could be said of the sound quality, but unfortunately, it only has 2 channel sound.<br /><br />And yes, I will buy the other versions that will come up, too. Hopefully these will play on all speakers ... ;-)
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This is a must buy, but my advice to anyone who wants this that already bought the 2004 edition is to do what I did  - sell the 2004 edition on ebay(30 something bucks) and buy this one, you won't fell as ripped off, you have the originals and you want have 2 versions of the 2004 edition.
B0009X7664|5.0|Having just read Charles Shields' biography of Harper Lee, \\"Mockingbird\\", and re-read her classic (and only) novel for at least the third time, I was able recently to watch Robert Mulligan's 1962 classic film adaptation with fresh eyes, and the 2005 Legacy Series Edition DVD fortunately contains a pristine print transfer and a bundle of extras that make repeated viewings more than worthwhile. Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.<br /><br />Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, \\"Boo\\", whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as \\"Boo\\" in an unexpected heroic act.<br /><br />Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as \\"Boo\\" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voiceover for the grown-up Scout ne&eacute; Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.<br /><br />The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J.

There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, \\"Fearful Symmetry\\", filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's \\"A Conversation with Gregory Peck\\", directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute. Providing revealing glimpses of the private man, it originally aired on PBS's \\"American Masters\\" series.rs plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as \\"Boo\\" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voiceover for the grown-up Scout neé Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get. <br /> <br />The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J.

1592400876|5.0|I realised I needed to read this book recently when a student in China told me that there is no apostrophe in the possessive \\"its\\".<br /><br />For an informative review from an expert in the English language, do a search for Quinion's World Wide Words.  At his site he's posted a great review of this book.<br /><br />Truss is a little pessimistic about the state of punctuation knowledge, I feel.  Maybe she's been more exposed to such silliness than I have.  But I'm finding that these days people are so well educated that I personally find it hard to find anything much to learn that everyone around me seems to know about already.  Certainly the people hanging out in the Amazon forums seem, at times, to be dauntingly well-educated.  (And then you get those without much better to do who are hanging out in forums being rude to people.)<br /><br />An enjoyable read from cover to cover.  Some parts made me laugh out loud, particularly page 49ff, with very funny visuals created by erroneous apostrophe usage!
6302402824|3.0|I espeically like TV Dinners but where<br /><br />are the ones for Back to the Future III<br /><br />& 'Arrested for driving while...' Like<br /><br />Cheap Trick, the second oldest US band,<br /><br />ZZ-Top did 'Pre-MTV' vids too. I guess<br /><br />they are lost forever...
B000H305U0|1.0|First album much better. If you are looking for something like the first, do not buy this. Tracks 1 & 2 are fun, but the rest of the songs are not good, are slow, and most sound the same as the song before.
B000GFLE86|5.0|My college-aged daughter introduced me to Madeline via \\"Careless Love,\\" which I adore, so I was ecstatic when she came home yesterday with this new CD.  It is awesome.  I repeated \\"Summer Wind\\" three times before I could force myself to move on.  And I must be one of the only people in the world who doesn't like \\"Smile,\\" but this version grabbed me.  Overall, this is a great album to throw on while sipping a glass of wine and winding down at the end of the day.  Excellent!
0156027321|5.0|Although the start of the book is slow, the finish is magical. This story is an example of an ingenious literary technic of rendering a tale with the beginning being a story with very believeable personal opinions, social statements and views, clear incidents of early childhood family experiences, continuing cleverly into a slowly woven tale told as a seemingly nonficticious adventure. The story eventually developes further into an epic like heroic saga and more than just real dramatic account that keeps the reader guessing about whether this perhaps truly have happened.<br /><br />Very original, thoughtful and just a great story. It's a really enjoyable book.
B000AARKW6|5.0|In many ways, Al Pacino's performance in Carlito's Way is far superior than that of his Tony Montana portrayal in Scarface.  Montana was just a young, greedy, genuinely bad person.  Carlito Brigante, on the other hand, is an old, pessimistic, ex-con who is trying to turn his life around.<br /><br />Carlito's Way is a very tough film to watch.  The whole time, there is an aura of dread surrounding every decision that Carlito makes.  Whenever he tries to do the right thing, there is always someone waiting there to guide him in the wrong direction, and it hurts the viewer every time he takes a step toward the fate that you know is coming.<br /><br />The only true De Palma moment in the film is the climactic chase and shootout throughout Grand Central Station.  The cinematography and score are amazing.  And the climactic shootout has some clever homages to a previous De Palma classic.  (Think train station escalators instead of train station staircase.)<br /><br />In many ways, this film doesn't feel like a De Palma, but it might be his highest quality film in terms of story, acting, and message.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The rather negative fan response to Lost Season 2 is expected, but I don't believe it's the show's fault.  It's network televisions.<br /><br />The serialized storytelling of Lost is so tight and complex, that its just not meant for weekly viewing.  Almost every episode would end with a cliffhanger, flashbacks in one episode would only have meaning 10 episodes later, and stories would keep side tracking onto other stories.  When a show like this has such an out of structure form of storytelling, it doesn't help much that you can only see one episode a week.<br /><br />Thank goodness for DVD season sets.<br /><br />Lost - Season 2 is phenomenal and exceeds beyond the already excellent Season 1, but you wouldn't have thought so if you tried watching it on TV.  Lost was designed for DVD.  It's a show you need to take your own sweet time with, to watch at your own leisure.  It's very much like a novel in that you read at your own speed and if you miss something, you can retrace your steps a few chapters back.<br /><br />You can probably say this about any show on DVD, but Lost is different in that you feel like you are watching one long movie or reading a great novel.  If you fell out of watching it during last years broadcast, it's because you were getting the story in pieces instead of seeing the whole picture.<br /><br />Anyway, the show is excellent, the extras are informative, and you can finally Season 2 how it was meant to be seen.  Uninterrupted.
B000H7J9RQ|4.0|After battling severe stage fright for the majority of the seventies and eighties, Barbra Streisand finally returned to the concert stage on September 6, 1986 for the \\"one night only\\" ONE VOICE concert. The show was heavily publicized in the media, tickets were sold at the astronomically high price of $5000 per couple, and columnists and critics everywhere were anxiously waiting to see if Streisand could overcome her immense performance-phobia and still deliver the goods. Fortunately, all of the hype was more than justified. When Streisand finally took the stage that night and opened the show with a tour de force performance of \\"Somewhere,\\" every member of the audience was left in awe of the stunning power of this woman's ageless voice. <br /> <br />Though Streisand was visibly and audibly nervous during her first few numbers, nothing could keep her undiminished vocal prowess from shining brightly through. If anything, her occasional jitteriness only made her seem more human. She was supported not by the typical orchestra, but by a small handful of musicians on electronic instruments. This actually provides the majority of the show with a warmer and more intimate feel. With the small band and the limited orchestration, it is Streisand's golden voice that is left at the forefront of the concert - and I wouldn't have it any other way. In addition to a slate of her own signature numbers, Streisand also performs some new material, such as the lovely \\"A New World\\" (from the 1954 version of A Star Is Born) and the traditional \\"America the Beautiful,\\" which was the perfect close to the moving evening. <br /> <br />A few more of the evening's many highlights include Barbra's haunting rendition \\"Send In The Clowns,\\" a relaxed duet with guest Barry Gibb on \\"What Kind Of Fool,\\" and a surprisingly lively performance of \\"The Way We Were,\\" with a newer, more contemporary arrangement. Most impressive of all Barbra's impassioned rendition of \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me?\\" that night is one of her most moving performances ever. Barbra also slips into a rare cover of \\"Over The Rainbow,\\" and does the song more justice than anyone since Judy Garland (whom Barbra dedicates the performance to). Instead of screaming the song out at the top of her lungs like Patti Labelle and Sam Harris, Barbra gives \\"Over The Rainbow\\" a beautifully understated performance and makes the number her own. <br /> <br />The profits from ONE VOICE benefited the Democratic Party, who were at the time trying to make sure a disaster like Chernobyl never happened again. Barbra's often-criticized stage dialogue on the issue may be a little heavy-handed at times, but you can tell she strongly believes every word of it. In particular, her speech proceeding \\"People,\\" though unoriginal, is very moving nonetheless. It is also a bit disappointing that the special's runtime is less than an hour, although the parody number \\"Send Home the Clowns\\" and Robin Williams' opening monologue seem to be the only major omissions from the evening's set list (and I can certainly live without both). <br /> <br />Other than the short runtime and the sometimes overbearing spoken statements, ONE VOICE is a great presentation of a special concert that will delight fans and even many cynics. In the end, ONE VOICE was a massive success. The concert was filmed and received record-breaking ratings when televised on HBO, while the audio recording of the show peaked at #9 on the Hot 200 and was quickly certified Platinum. Most importantly, ONE VOICE raised over $1.5 million which led Barbra to establish the \\"Streisand Foundation,\\" which supports numerous charitable organizations.
B000008H4E|5.0|For those of you who thought Vangelis was too musically complex, the this production by the one and only jon Anderson its your best introduction to Vangelis opus.<br /><br />This is a innocent, emotive, space filling and melodic album. The electronics are flawless as well as the intervention of Jon's voice.<br /><br />more than 20 years later, I find it refreshing for the soul.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|...and could only take one Pink Floyd album, this would be the one.
B0000252YK|5.0|Listen to your heart and not what others say - OK Enough of the crap!! This is metal all the way. we're not talking thrash metal or death metal, but straight out heavy metal. When I heard this back in 86 I thought WOW! this is metalic, along with Whitesnake - featuring John Sykes - a year later. No Rest For the Wicked came next - with Zakk - and Boom! hit in the face again. Lets put this in context of the other metal groups and it comes out pretty heavy. what's everyone crapping on about, who was heavier in the rock area? Dio's first two and Iron Maiden's early records also rock hard, but aren't as heavy as this, Maiden is more old school anyway - sellout this, sellout that. Just buy it and enjoy - Jake has killer riffs - its electric.  <br /> <br />If you like the guitar sound, check out - <br />Whitesnake - 1987 <br />Blue Murder - Blue Murder (Featuring John Sykes after leaving Whitesnake) <br />All Zakks stuff <br />Badlands - 2 albums featuring Jake E Lee <br />Dio - Holy Diver - Last in Line <br /> <br />If you want heavier stuff <br />Arch Enemy <br />Soilwork <br />In Flames <br />Immortal <br />Post Pankiller Judas Priest with Halford <br />Halford - Resurrection <br />Primal Fear - most albums have cool riffs
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|30 Seconds To Mars are fantastic!!! I'd recommend this album to everyone I meet because I love them, A Beautiful Lie was the first track I heard and immediately bought both albums. <br /> <br />The gorgeous Jared Leto (Requiem For A Dream, Lord Of War, My So Called Life) is the lead singer with brother Shannon Leto is excellent on the drums with Tomo (Milicevic) and Matt (Wachter) on guitars and bass. Four very talented rockers making awesome music. <br /> <br />Love it!!
B000GDH9AA|1.0|Poor audio quality, no-name publisher, even gaps inside songs when whoever taped this hit the pause button by mistake.  Don't buy it.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, and I've always loved Cee-Lo as well as Danger Mouse's production, but comming together to form the group Gnarls Barkley, just doesn't seem to mix for this reviewer. Cee-Lo has had a sucessful career ever since hes left Goodie Mob, realeasing two albums. Hooking up with Danger Mouse to create \\"St. Elsewhere\\" just didn't seem to mix sucessfully. Probably becasue Cee-Lo sings completely on this album, and hardly lays down any rap vocals (something that he's been known for doing). The first single \\"Crazy\\" is a nice song to listen to, sounding like pop music from the 80's. My favorite track is \\"Smiley Faces\\" where Cee-Lo matches Danger Mouses production perfectly.<br /><br />Speaking of Danger Mouse, his production is nice. I really didn't get into him until the \\"DangerDoom\\" album. Everything that he's made goes along with the concept of this album. Some of his beats are fast paced, like the song \\"Crazy\\", that will have a lot of people catching a musical vibe from.<br /><br />A lot of these tracks had my head nodding briefly, but I just couldn't get into the album. Maybe I just can't accept the fact that Cee-Lo will never be the same since he left the group Goodie Mob. He's strictly pop now with this album, and holds a sucessful career since branching out. Less than 35 minutes long, makes the album seem kind of short. I'm sorry people, but I just wasn't feeling this album from an experimental standpoint. If you have a taste for experimental pop music more than I do, I highly recommend this to you.<br /><br />Other notable tracks: Go-Go Gadget Gospel, Feng Shui, Who Cares?, and On-Line
B000002518|5.0|I had this on LP when I was a kid in the 70s.<br /><br />Hearing it on CD makes it even better.<br /><br />Acoustic ballads, blue grass and some great Dylan lyrics<br /><br />A must get
B00005OAIE|5.0|I am writing this less than two weeks after hearing John live in Indianapolis, where he played Tracks 1-3 and 5 (not #4--thank goodness--more about that later). \\"Continuum\\" was three days away from release. Because my husband and I went to the concert for Sheryl Crow, we'd assumed he was opening for her.  When she came out first, we realized this guy must be someone big that we'd just never hear of (we tend to listen to jazz, 70s Rock, and for our daughter, whatever's on Radio Disney).  Because this music was brand new to us, we couldn't tell older songs from newer.  It was all solid and good.  I left the concert bound and determined to find all his recordings. <br /> <br />Other people have written better than I can how good this is.  I will just add, that if you listen carefully, there are hints of the direction he wanted to go all through this record.  You'll hear them, among other places in the bridge section of \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\"--funky stuff!--and all throughout \\"Neon\\"--which sounds like Steely Dan meets Eric Clapton and even \\"City Love\\" with its not-quite-wailing guitar solo. Mr. Mayer's lyrics also hit the spot: \\"No Such Thing\\" \\"Why Georgia?\\" and \\"My Stupid Mouth\\"--oh man, where were these songs when I was young?  They say exactly how I felt then. (and still feel sometimes even though I'm a long way from 21)   <br /> <br />Let's talk just a minute about Track #4.  You either love it or hate it, I guess. The verses and chorus make me grin. The bridge--oh my stars and garters. I, for one, am glad he's decided not to sing it in his concerts anymore.  For one thing, you wouldn't be able to hear him for the screaming fans.  For another--during the bridge section, when he goes into that minor key--well, I'd be screaming, too.  :) <br /> <br />Live long and prosper, John Mayer!
B000001E29|5.0|Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant.  Not since The Doors' rendition of Alabama Song has their been such perfect cabaret-art rock - though to be fair such music really defies any strict attempts at categorizing.  It's just great music.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I don't even remember what happened in X-men 3 or Pirates, I mix up all the animal movies this year with one another, but one thing I know is that Cars is my favorite movie of the year!! I can't wait for the DVD. I want to get this movie for my 8 month old niece, my future kids and grandkids! I am so in love with this movie.
B00005UKE0|5.0|My musical awakening came on the back of three artists - George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Jethro Tull. They were three 'sounds' I just loved at the age of 12. Of them, I've remained a JT fan to this day, and a Bob Dylan fan until his Christian era (though I still listen avidly to his music up to that point). George Harrison I never followed beyond Living in the Material World. The last thing I bought was Extra Texture and found it disappointing. <br /> <br />However, I did rediscover George many years later and now rank him at least the best of the ex-Beatles. However, I see many reviewers wonder what it would have been like if John Lennon and Paul had only allowed George's songs more space. Well I think it would have resulted in sub-standard Beatles albums.  <br /> <br />None of the ex-Beatles lived up to their Beatles standards (except maybe Ringo, with a little help from his friends), so to shine as the best ex-Beatle is quite a different thing to shining as the best Beatle. <br /> <br />Some of the best late-Beatles songs were written by George, but few of the songs on All Things Must Pass would have been up to prime-time Beatles standard. Most of George's songs sound like George songs rather than Beatle songs, and while I love his early career sound, it could never be better than the Beatles. The very essence of the Beatles was the group dynamic - they brought out the best in each other in a competitive way, and edited out each other's songs not up to standard. As solo artists, no editing took place so any old rubbish tended to get recorded. <br /> <br />While I love this album as background music, I don't find it stands up to intense listening - there's too many tracks I'd rather skip, and the demos and jams simply dilute the quality of the recoding. <br /> <br />What I most appreciate about George is what many others seem to like least - the spiritual nature of his lyrics. In my mind, George will be forever associated with spiritualism and things Eastern. I ownnone of his recordings (except the Dark Horse compilation) between Dark Horse and Brainwashed, and far from regarding the recordings I do own as 'preachy' I can identify with his message. <br /> <br />Anyone who can vote a second term for a war-mongerer like George Bush simply has to be brainwashed.
B000002O51|2.0|As good as the first 2 were as in no bad songs,this one is hard to find one good one which is to bad. Gave it 2 stars because i like boston. Dont let your heart tell you its good,its not very.
B000H305U0|3.0|Another solid effort from Timberlake.  This is so different from Justified - beat heavy, a lot less singing, more collaborations with rappers, and sooooo much Timbaland.  I could be wrong, but I really don't hear a lot of radio friendly music on this disc, so I'll be surprised to see how many hits this one generates.  I would have liked to hear more singing from Justin, although he does seem to do more of that on the second half of the disc.  \\"Sexyback\\" that track is fire.  I also like \\"My Love,\\" \\"Losing My Way,\\" (why is he singing about being a crack-head/) \\"Pose\\" - there are a couple of throw-aways on here, but all-in-all this is another slick, finely crafted/produced joint that should keep Timberlake on top.  I actually think Justified is the better of the two.
B0000AKY7R|4.0|... to give us this creative and beautiful interpretation of Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" with guitars instead of saxophone!<br /><br />McLaughlin was already known as a jazz guitarist who ventured into rock territory - kudos to him for that, too! - and Santana was a rock guitarist venturing into jazz territory.<br /><br />If you like MUSIC, you will appreciate this album by two of the world's most accomplished and unique guitarists.<br /><br />Maybe not a GREAT album, but certainly one worth listening to, and especially if you are a Santana or McLaughlin fan.<br /><br />I remember when this came out and although I liked it, it was way beyond my scope. Now I can appreciate it and it is even more remarkable for the time in which it was made.
B000F3AAUW|1.0|Bought the album based on the quality of the single \\"Crazy\\" which is a great song. Was totally underwhelmed by the rest of the Album which is mediocre at best. Dont believe the hype.
0679735909|5.0|Fabulous, sumptuous, and superb. This is one complex, twisted, literary-type book that is also fascinating and intensely readable. I often start reading books of this genre with a sense of trepidation, because however good they are, they're also so often dense and maze-like with the vividness of the characters and plot bogged down in the author's strivings for intellectual/pyschological depth, with the result that the reader is always kept at a distance, struggling like a drowning man to feel empathy for the characters and to actually WANT to continue reading. This book is different-it flows along with an unselfconscious and almost effortless ease, establishing the characters as empathetic human people in our minds and moving the plot along without unnecessary jargon, while at the same time layering it with a rich tapestry of words, details, and emotions, so that the past and the present pictured in the novel weave together and reflect on each other. I was stunned and carried along by the ease with which one sentence flows into the next, and riveted by the characters and the passion of the world I found myself in. Once in a long while I find a book in which I can actually feel my brain expanding at the depth and stunning simplicity of the author's vision. This is one of them-read it. It's passionate and lyrical, rich and wonderful.
B000FIMG68|4.0|The first season of Lost quickly set the pace and dynamic of the show--namely frantic, spontaneous turns of events that introduce new questions regarding the island and its new inhabitants.  Season 2 carries on and furthers that dynamic, adding new mysteries to an already very mysterious place, and it engages viewers by tying up loose ends from the first season--only to loosen more strings. <br /> <br />Main features of Season include the Hatch, which we discover ensnares Jack, Kate, Locke, et al in a dangerous gamble, one that weighs heavily on the characters every episode; the so-called \\"Tailies\\", which introduce and explore the lives of a new group of characters; and the clashing between the plane survivors and the others, a clashing that elevates Michael to one of the most important roles in the show, despite limited appearances in Season 2.  Mark it down: the developments surrounding Michael, specifically regarding Walt, pose as some of the most crucial elements to the show's progress. <br /> <br />Season 2 was particularly satisfying because it answered questions left over from Season 1, including (besides the hatch) Claire's disappearance, the importance of the numbers, and why the plane went down in the first place (though Season 2 leaves this question open enough to be addressed in future seasons).  That said, others remain, such as why Walt is so special and what the \\"monsters\\" really are.  And of course, new questions are asked: What is the Dharma Initiative? What is the Others' plan?  In between all of the above are a gamut of surprises, thrills, relationship developments, and more. Not unexpectedly, Season 2 ends on a cliffhanger that is almost intriquing as Season 1's.  In sum, a great season that will not disappoint.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Absolutely superb! <br /> <br />Hollywood has shown that they can produce work that doesn't over do profanity, sex and uncontrolled violence as a theme, yet is totally engrossing! <br /> <br />There's just the \\"right\\" touch of all of the above to make a good story. <br /> <br />Well Done! <br /> <br />Perfect casting, scripts, filming, make-up, special effects, production, directing--one of those series where each episode is a work of art. <br /> <br />Well worth the price. (P.S. I was about to give up hope on Hollywood, but this series gives them a breather....)
0385508417|2.0|I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or \\"written down to\\".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o\
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Man, these guys seemed to have an undying flow of amazing ideas. Ever since I heard Butterflies and Hurricanes, I was drawn to the power and emotion that these guys have. Of course, many times such an amazing release is followed by something of a lesser degree that is the beginning of the end for most bands. This is not the case. Black Holes and Revelations is just amazing on so many levels, be it spaghetti western influnce, surf or just powerful rock, the production, the mixing, the harmonies (and too much more to mention), this CD is pretty much the highest point of the music world at this point in time. There is so many different things to find in this CD that it's impossible to describe it in words. Muse is not a band of semi-talented musicians that are only effective together. They are all playing great stuff here without overplaying. The vocals and guitars are very clear, the bass is tight with the drums and the drummer is just tearin' it up. The first song sounds like a modern day Telstar and rocks at the end. There is a song that sounds like layered Queen harmonies, one that has a sort of Mexi-pop feel with a greatly mixed trumpet solo, some old western clean (with appropriate reverb mix and trem bar) and just all things that make these guys the best in the world right now. Maybe others can pinpoint exactly what this disc sounds like, but for me, I can say that these guys have taken the torch from every great British band (Led Zep, Floyd, The Beatles, The Who and so on) and the bear the task of carrying it alone. Just amazing stuff!!<br /><br />PS I've been a pro musician for about 25 years. When I hear this band and especially this release, I'm pretty motivated and jealous at the same time. Why couldn't I be in a a band like this???

B000H7JD4A|3.0|Ahh yes, now this is the album that should've been the first following Iron Maiden's reunion in 1999!<br /><br />No, it isn't Iron Maiden, it's not Powerslave, it's not even Fear of the Dark, but this album is quite addictive. Bruce's vocal style is closer to that of his solo project, rather than trying to recapture his operatic choirboy vocals of Maiden's golden years. Dave, Jan, and Adrian seem to be a bit more comfortable with eachother than before, as evidenced by their riff/solo distribution. Also, the production is great and not as tinny as the previous two albums, despite Kevin Shirley remaining at his post as engineer/producer.<br /><br />The main gripe I have regarding the album is that the band seems to have an obssession with needless jangly-chorded intros, and most of the songs are about 2-4 minutes longer than they need to be. Also, as I mentioned earlier, Bruce has been steadily moving away from his operatic Broadway voice, which may deter diehard fans of the band's classic sound...I personally find it rather refreshing.<br /><br />This is perhaps not only the best representation, but also the most cohesive and well-written collection of Maiden's contemporary sound. If you've been disappointed by the Blaze Bailey era, and/or Brave New World and Dance of Death just didn't quite move you, then this one should sate your desire for some fresh Iron Maiden.

1594200823|5.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is an exploration into the foods that are on our plates and why. The answers he delivers are at times frightening.<br /><br />Whenever I read a book like this, I believe more and more that the food industry has set aside our own individual nutrition needs for a larger paycheck. What's frightening is that we have little say over what is sold in our grocery stores.<br /><br />Breaking down the corn industry, Pollan gives us an insider look at what our beef is being fed, how the processing of feed corn leads to hundreds of other food products, and of course how much of it we actually eat in a given day. (It's much more than you can believe!)<br /><br />After exposing the industrial corn conglomerate, Pollan then talks about the organic industry and how they've become industrialized as well, which is not good news for those who swear by organically grown foods and still buy them in the supermarket.<br /><br />Finally, to \\"solve\\" the omnivore's dilemma, he goes out and tries to make his own meal by hunting, scavenging, and using almanac-type knowledge to put a meal on his plate, which truly is an amusing and intriguing ending to a powerful and poignant book.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who cares about what they're putting in their body... which should be all of you! This book is definitely on my \\"A\\" list!<br /><br />Kevin Gianni, NCSF-CPT<br /><br />Author and Personal Trainer
B0000542DH|4.0|There is an old saying in which it is said that, \\"you don't blame Frankenstein for being a mindless killer of people, you blame the doctor that made him\\". In Natural Born Killers you will view what appears to be nothing less than, a waking nightmare of the result of the desensitization of the youth of America (lightly peppered with the abusive dysfunctional parenting, seen in more homes than we care to acknowledge). <br /> <br />If you talk to anyone who has seen this movie, and ask what they think, you will find very few lukewarm responses, for most you will find that they either love it or hate it. For those who love it i have found that they often times, have a very real understanding of America, the negative affect of the media on today's youth, and the backlash that has come as a result (and mind you that this is not all the medias fault, but also the influence of dysfunctional parents and homes found littered all over the country) . If you need an example look at John Mark Karr; the man says he raped and killed Jon Benet Ramsey, he's swarmed by the press, gets endless media coverage, and when its all over will likely sell his story to the highest bidder and become a millionaire for being a lying pervert. ONLY IN AMERICA!!!! <br /> <br />In Natural Born Killers you watch as a young Mickey and Mallory (victims of sexual, physical and emotional abuse)stroll through American pop culture, cutting a bloody swath of sociopath destruction wherever they go. <br /> <br />The worse part some find is that the ethical part of you wants to hate the two for the carnage and terror they spill wherever they go. Yet, the sad truth is, in all Americans there lies a level of blood lust that makes us want to exact revenge upon those that have hurt us (i.e. Bin Laden), and this small area hidden within us all, leaves many (well at least it left me) at some points in the movie to actually root for Mickey and Mallory (i.e. when Mickey and Mallory 'deal' with Mallory's sexually abusivefather, and her mother who ignores her daughters cries for help). <br /> <br />The use of color, black and white, and nightmarish flashes are dare i say sublime and mesmerizing. The acting simply as good as it comes. But i will say if you live in the sugar coated world that portrays America in the wholesome buttoned down image once seen in the Laurence Welk Show avoid this movie at all cost. This movie is not for the weak, squeamish, or those blind to the reality of a generation of Natural Born Killers growing up in society today. <br /> <br />This movie is simply as real as it gets, it shows the mind of, the making of, and the results of a monster of Americas making.  <br /> <br />Watch at your own risk.
B000056OBA|5.0|When my son Joe was 12, he reluctantly agreed to listen to the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  To my surprise, he sat still through the entire lengthy, complicated piece, a minor miracle considering even his favorite video game had never held his attention for that long.  His reaction after my roof finally settled back into place - Beethoven is not for easy-listening ears - made me realize that my wife and I best  hold our grown-up conversations out of our son's ear-shot.  \\"Boy, I bet Hitler loved that!'' he excitedly announced.  And so it is with Beethoven.  The German composer -- such a genius that music experts consider him, alone, the bridge between the delicate, formulistic Classical period and the emotion-packed Romantics - touches something very deep, something almost dangerous, with his barely tamed symphonies.  Not that Beethoven wrote only bombast. Unlike Hitler's favorite composer, the over-the-top Wagner, his quiet moments are as tuneful and, well, pretty, as any delicacy Mozart ever whipped up.  But you know the calm always precedes one of Beethoven's musical hurricanes, so stirring it's hard to believe a mere mortal wrote them.  Perhaps the best example of Beethoven's incredible musical tension is this recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  Skip the over-played first movement, so familiar it overshadows what follows, including the astonishing fourth movement with its almost eight minutes of ever-intensifying climaxes.  The Berlin Philharmonic's crisp and versatile strings, and its heralding brass - surely Gideon sat in the lead chair -- will mist the eyes of anyone with a soul.  The German company Deutsche Grammophone also re-released Von Karajan and the Philharmonic's recordings of Beethoven's eight other symphonies and packaged them in one set of CDs.
038551123X|5.0|Having spent a few years working in forensic psychology, all I can say is delightful well done job on Dexter.  I don't know of one part where it rang false.  I flew through the book simply because Dexter carried me through it.  He didn't break the pattern one time.
B000G75AE8|4.0|Yeah, this one rules. Good month for classic metal bands, between this and the new Maiden. <br /> <br />It's good to have Lombardo back. I think Bostaph might have in some ways been a more technically accomplished drummer, but Lombardo's got FEEL, weird as that may sound when talking about a band like Slayer. Don't get me wrong, I really like the albums with Bostaph, and I liked the different directions it sometimes pushed the band, but there is an undeniable chemistry with Lombardo. <br /> <br />Any complaints? Well, first let me address some of the other complaints I've seen here. People are upset about \\"Jihad,\\" with the lyrics from the perspective of a 9/11 hijacker. Why would they write such a thing? people lament. I think Araya answered it best when he said, \\"Because we're f**king Slayer.\\" Good enough for me. <br /> <br />And all the bashing on the lyrics in general? Come on! These guys are a one trick pony in that department. They always have been. If you're an embarrassed 30-something who doesn't want to hear \\"Hail Satan!\\" coming from the speakers of your SUV, DON'T BUY A SLAYER ALBUM! Simple enough. What did you expect? Meditations on the joys of fatherhood? Stock tips? Yanni covers?  <br /> <br />And yeah, for the record, I'm 30, and consider myself all grown up, and I still get a devilish charge out of listening to Tom Araya yell like the devil about the Devil. <br /> <br />Which brings me to why I like this album so much. It, for all its simlilarity to what they've done in the past, still manages to sound newer, scarier, meaner, and more GENUINE than any of the 20 something death/black/emocore metal bands out there. 15 year-old kids still buy Slayer albums at Hot Topic in droves. That would'be been the equivalent of me buying a new Foghat CD in 1991, when I was 15. \\"Yeah, Dad, Foghat rock. Really. But I think I'll spend my Burger King money on the new Anthrax, thank you very much.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Christ Illusion\\" comes roaring out of the speaker, utterly uncompromised, utterly energized, spewing forth with as much conviction as \\"Reign\\" or \\"Seasons\\" or any other classic Slayer fare. The only reason this thing gets 4 instead of 5 is the lack of innovation, but that's even kind of petty. Telling a grizzled, middle-aged Slayer to change their tune is like telling a wolverine to stop eating meat on its 8th birthday. Not only will it not listen, it'll probably tear your head off and eat you next.
038572179X|5.0|The overall state of the book was perfect, though the book had to travel a large distance it had no damage at all!!! <br />The novell itself is allright though very psichological to my liking. You can learn enough of the second world war from a very particular point of view. It's entertaining and very educative. <br />Recomendable.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|OK, I am obssessed with this album. Pleasantly and surprisingly so. I've stayed faithful to these guys, even through the hated \\"Blaze\\" years (a period in which I contend that Harris' production did more damage than Bayley's vocals ever could). I loved Brave New World, although it did beg the question, \\"Why 3 guitars?\\" Besides keeping the peace, of course. Also lacking was any sense of the spirit of Dickinson's superb, and I mean SUPERB duo of masterpiece records, \\"Chemical Wedding\\" and \\"Accident of Birth.\\" But those questions aside, Brave New World was a satisfying, epic album.  Then came \\"Dance of Death,\\" an offering that was as resoundingly uninspired as \\"BNW\\" was a return to form. With the exception of \\"Montsegur\\" and \\"Pachendale,\\" \\"DOD\\" was to my ears the second weakest release in the entire catalog, after \\"Fear of the Dark.\\"  Meantime, Dickinson released \\"Tyranny of Souls,\\" a very good  (if slightly sterile) album that emphasized his different vocal approach vis a vis his solo vs Maiden work.  Now we have \\"A Matter of Life and Death,\\" and my God, its like Maiden set out to answer and resolve all of my questions. The three guitars are finally working together, weaving in and out and complimenting each other in ways are simply stunning. \\"BNW\\" and \\"DOD\\" always sounded like two guys were doing one thing while the other was somewhere else. Here, they all have their own parts, and in a marvel of moderm music engineering, their own place in the sound field. A big hats off to Kevin Shirley for the production on this one.  And Dickinson is finally bringing his ball to the playground. A much more varied phrasing, remisiscent of some of his best solo moments, is evident on this album. A stellar performance from the only great metal voice whose pipes seem to be getting BETTER with age. When it comes to maintaining his range and timbre, Bruce must know a secret Geoff Tate and Chris Cornell never figured out.  But all that aside, what really shines on this record are the SONGS. They went all out epic on this one, more so than \\"BNW,\\" equalling even the grandeur of \\"Seventh Son\\" at times. The weakest track is the opener, a curious problem Maiden have had for some time now. It's almost like they want to get the 4-minute radio song out of the way and move on to bigger and better things.  Fine by me. From then on out, there's not a weak one in the bunch. \\"Brighter Than 1000 Suns\\" is an incredible, multi-faceted epic that manages to be melodic and heavy as hell at the same time. (For the music geeks out there, it also sees Maiden venturing into odd time land, something they don't do often; the main body of the song is in 7/4. More striking is the use of downtuned guitars, a first to my knowledge. Sure, its only a 1/2 step, but that's drastic for these guys.)  Then there's \\"The Pilgrim,\\" a shorter, more rollicking tune than veers from Celtic to Eastern modalities and back, \\"The Longest Day,\\" a midtempo epic with a great chorus, followed by \\"Out of the Shadows,\\" a kind-of ballad that merits mentioning if only because it sounds like it could easily have shown up on Dickinson's last solo album. Very cool to hear one of Dickinson's ideas given the full Maiden treatment.  Then comes \\"Benjamin Breeg,\\" the much lauded lead single. Read the other reviews to hear about it; there seems to be a consensus on this one. Then we hit the only song on the album penned by Harris alone. \\"For The Greater Good of God.\\" Over 9 minutes. About a million ideas, riffs, and melodies. Awesome.  Things get a bit darker on \\"Lord of Light,\\" which seems to balance the previous track, lyrically.  The last, and possibly best, song, \\"The Legacy,\\" is incredible. Great intro, very cool, slowly building midtempo gallop verse and chorus, and then the whole thing goes for broke with a rollicking 6/8 riff that bears a more than passing resemblance to the middle riff from \\"Black Sabbath.\\" Fitting that it was probably written by Gers, who's got his lead roots in late-era Iommi splatter solos. There is a passion, almost a rasp, to Dickinsons's voice on this one that isn't present on the rest of the album. Works to great effect on this song.  So there you have it. A great album from a band that should've landed in the has-been bin over 10 years ago. Can't keep a good Iron down, I guess.
B000H4JGZY|4.0|Now, as far as a sound for this album. It is a more mature sound for Justin.,But not a  new sound for music. Along with this more mature sound, I was expecting topics to be a little bit more mature then, they were on this album. But,let me give credit were credit is due. Take the song \\"Losing My Way\\" were you can take away several messages from that song. Another track would be (Another song)All over again) were it, too has it's messages. The song \\"sexy Back\\" lyrically I just don't get it. It will probably be one of those songs that either a light bulb as to turn on in my head or, will remain a mystery to me forever. \\"MY Love featuring Mr. Clifford Harris is one of my two favorite songs on the album period. I guess because of the rhythm. \\"Damn Girl\\" has that old school 60's 70's funk to it. And this goes without saying I do give justin credit for not using your tipical sound in music today.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Give this album a try; ignore what the critics and other reviewers have said.  I popped this baby in my pc and let it play randomly, IMO the only way to listen to it.  The first four songs seemed to fit my mood perfectly,  Velvet Dress, Playboy Mansion, Please, and IGWSHA.  U2 has always been about the passion, honesty, and pure humanity in their music (example, watch a live \\"Streets\\" and try not to be moved!) Believe me, this album will not disappoint.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was never a fan of Buffy and so never thought much of Joss Whedon. So when one of my friends lent me the Firefly box set I was quite sceptical of his sky high opinions of Firefly. I eventually got round to watching it one night simply because there was nothing on TV and I was bored. How wrong I was, the show started with a great theme tune that really grows on you and the series just gets better. After the third episode I really couldn't believe how good this show was. I found out it was cancelled and nearly cried. You really do get so close to the characters as the cast and writing, in fact everything about the show is just perfect. Luckily after the TV show was cancelled they did make a film called Serenity which I also highly recommend, it will not let you down.     <br />Do yourself a favour and buy this show and the film Serenity. And please hope to god that we haven't seen the last of the Firefly gang after Serenity. To see this show and the film is to love it, it really is that good. I now consider myself a huge fan of Firefly and it certainly is my favourite TV show of all time (and Serenity one of my very favourite films!). And if Joss or any Fox network guys ever reads this please, please, please can we have some more!!     <br />

B00004RYIM|3.0|This star-making vehicle for Brad Davis, he of the more-carnal-than James Dean school, has elements of real tension and hopeless Turkish jail atmosphere.<br /><br />There are flaws, however, including a script that isn't entirely faithful to Hayes' story and a no-doubt-studio-inspired \\"no, I cant kiss a dude, even in prison\\" moment that Mr. Hayes (to say nothing of Mr. Davis) never quite experienced in real-life.<br /><br />And the booby-thru-glass-partition scene is just plain silly. (Did this happen?!?)<br /><br />Also, the film gets a little draggy with its one-atrocity-after-another approach to telling its tale... not always to the greatest effect.<br /><br />Still a decent movie.
B00006LA7P|5.0|This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book \\"The Bourne Identity\\". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural \\"Bourne\\" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.py thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall.

B00000JBCP|5.0|Mana + MTV...great music along with a great/experienced television network. It doesn't get any better then this.
B00020X960|5.0|This is an outstanding film. Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer prize winning book, \\"The Killer Angels\\", it tells the story of the battle at Gettysburg, which took place over the first three days of July in 1863. For the most part, the film examines that pivotal battle, one of the bloodiest of the war, from the perspective of the commanders who were calling the shots (no pun intended).<br /><br />The viewer will be enthralled by the film's recreation of the battle at Gettysburg, which examines some of the militairy stratagems employed and the reasons for them. It attempts to explain how it was that over fifty thousand (50,000) men lay dead or injured at its conclusion. It also recreates one of the most amazing routs in history, when Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, defying the odds, held off the Confederates at Little Round Top, part of the high ground that the Union needed to retain at Gettysburg. Chamberlain, who was not a professional soldier but a professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor and success in holding the Confederacy at bay at Little Round Top. Jeff Daniels, who plays the role of Chamberlain, is superlative.<br /><br />The rest of the star studded cast is likewise marvelous. Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee, Richard Jordan as General Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as General Pickett, in particular, all deserve a standing ovation, as does Jeff Daniels. This is a film that attempts to be historically accurate, and it succeeds brilliantly. It does not glamorize war, but shows it in all its heartbreaking reality. It even depicts General Pickett's audacious charge, which saw the loss of an entire division of Confederate soldiers. This is a film entirely about the men who took part in the battle at Gettysburg and the outcome that set the course for the country we know today. Kudos to director Robert F. Maxwell, who directed this film. It is simply a magnificent movie. Bravo!simply a magnificent movie. Bravo!
0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield is a delicious old-fashioned-with-a-new-twist kind of read. From its rich-toned  cover to its windswept vistas, this book is full of the old England we've read and loved. It's chalked full of secrets, obsessions and suprises at every turn. Wow. This debut novel delivers with its sumptous scenes and rivoting plot.<br /><br />Vida Winter, the famous and reclusive writer contacts bookish biographer, Margaret Lea to write the true account of her life after years of offering nothing but unreliable versions--and this is only the beginning. The two women have more in common than they realize--lies, truths, half-truths, twists and turns and switchbacks occur at a heartpounding pace. On a more philosophical level, it asks the questions: What are the truths about our own lives? What stories have we told to create and recreate ourselves?<br /><br />This Bronte, Austin, Du Maurier concoction is impossible to put down. The weekend's coming up and I sugguest you buy this book, put on a pot of tea, find your fuzzy house slippers and read The Thirteenth Tale far into the night.<br /><br />~Carol D. O'Dell, author of Mothering Mother, Kunati Publishing, April 2007.
B000FSME1A|4.0|Despite the absence of \\"Hearts Of Darkness\\" (which I suspect is still tied up in the legal morass that has kept it out-of-print for the last decade), \\"The Complete Dossier\\" is a great value for the price. Coppola's commentary is entertaining and filled with little insights you won't hear elsewhere. The extras are not hugely in-depth, but you get more than you usually would with a nearly 30-year-old film. I found the behind-the-scenes montage used to accompany Brando's 17-minute reading of \\"The Hollow Men\\" to be quite creatively done. Finally, there is another plus to both films being split over two discs apart from the quality image issue: it's an easy way to compare the subtle editing differences in specific scenes between the 1979 and 2001 releases.
015603252X|4.0|A TALE OF LOVE AND DARKNESS is a deeply poignant, lyrical tapestry of memories that will be much loved by admirers of Oz's work. The prose is finely crafted, as we'd expect from a writer of Oz's stature. This book is not a memoir, as such--its narrative is not linear, but waxes and wanes through various themes. Arching over the narrative is the shadow of Oz's loss of his mother. My one reservation about the book is that I feel Oz withholds from us--it's never really adequately explained why he changed his name to Oz or what train of thoughts led him to do this. Was he attempting to erase the trauma of his profound loss? Regardless, this work will linger with you after you finish its final pages.
B000HT386M|5.0|This was a very funny movie, especially if you are an Adam Sandler fan. It is kind of a remake of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" or a modern day \\"Scrooge\\" except that it is not a Christmas story and it is really hilarious.  <br /> <br />Adam Sandler portrays a frustrated architect for a large firm who is very over worked for too little money. He has no time for his wife and children or anything else in life but work. Kate Beckinsale portrays Sandler's beautiful wife. So one night while he is out shopping for a remote control for his TV he comes across an \\"angel\\" played by Christopher Walken who gives him a remote that enables him to fast forward through the parts of his life that seem unimportant.

B00003CX8U|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films.  Fosse only made 5 feature films in his career (Sweet Charity, Cabaret, Lenny, this one, and Star 80), but everyone is a masterpiece.  This is his best film.  It's an autobiographical film about a filmmaker/choreographer who's addicted to work, booze, pills, sex, work, booze, more pills, etc., etc..  It's definitely based of Fosse himself, and it's a rather painful portrait.  Fosse should be commended for admitting (for lack of a better term) that's he's not a great person.  There's no \\"closure\\" scenes here, where Joe Gideon (wonderfully played by Roy Scheider, Fosse's alter ego) realises the error of his ways, and makes peace with everyone.  Fosse shows warts and more warts, but in spite of that, the film is amazing.  Brilliantly edited, shot, acted, and choreographed, this is Fosse's best film, one that really defined him as an artist.  Fosse was not a prolific filmmaker, but when he did make a film, it was a masterpiece.  And this is his greatest one...

B000FSME1A|4.0|I agree one hundred percent with everyone here who is upset that this collection does not contain the great doc about the making of this film, \\"Heart of Darkness\\"(still relegated to the purgatory of what I call, \\"Why must I still keep my VCR?

Why not put all of the origanel \\"Apocalypse\\" on one disc with some features, and then \\"Redux\\" on the second disc with the other features. I know there's room Paramont and Zoetrope! <br />But I'm going to talk about what is here, and with the exception of the whole changing discs things(don't mind it on the extended cuts of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" movies however) this is an excellent collection for fans of this flawed masterpiece. The movies look great and the sound is excellent. Coppola's commentaries for both films will be essential listening for ever film fan/ film student in the future. All the extras are great and informative and show even more behind the scenes mayhem that went into making this movie. Add to that, the packaging here is great and fits the movie perfectly. <br />If you like this film, in either of it's versions, you will more than likely dig this package. It has it's flaws, and you know what those are, so you can make the decision on whether or not this set appeals to you. <br />For people who are new to this film then this is the edition you should get. Or wait another year or two before they \\"re-release\\" it with \\"Heart of Darkness\\". <br />A dissapointing but still worthwhile collection.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Mr. Mayer finally made an album on par with his actual talents!  I have always liked him personally and as a musician I've always respected his formidable guitar playing and unique vocals, but I've never purchased any of his albums before because I didn't think they represented what he is capable of.  With the release of Continuum, I believe we've finally seen the true John Mayer.  This album is different from his past ones, it is not over-produced like the others, and I think this is because John produced this himself and he knows you can still make great songs with a three piece band.  The music is diverse, cool, sexy, and smart.  This is not the standard pop album he once made for the teenie bopper demographic.  This is, dare I say, music with adult-sensibilities, or music for those with any kind of real musical knowledge.       Yes, it's a soft rock record, but sexy-groove music isn't supposed sound hard.  This record isn't going to bring in legions of new fans, it's still Mayer, just the best version we've seen of him artistically speaking.  I'd be surprised if this outsold his first album.  But if you're like me, and always thought of Mayer as the kid with alot of potential in class who never lived up to it, you're gonna wanna give Continuum a listen, because somebody just stepped up to the plate.  Welcome, for the first time, John.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Download takes awhile, but the picture quality was great, even full screen. It played all the way through. And, to boot, it's an excellent show.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is a perfect example of modern heavy metal. After realeasing their first album in 1998 and gaining a small cult following, System of a Down broke through to the mainstream with Toxicity, an album even crazier than it's predecessor, with tricky time-changes, funky drum patterns, fast guitar riffs with odd tunings, and politcal lyrics sung in such a way that it almost makes light of the world's problems. Where their first album is heavier, this one is more complex. You can find yourself in a groove, only to have it change, and seconds later have it change again. There are lots of mosh-worthy moments, and parts that sound almost middle-eastern due to Daron's style and unique tuning. <br /> <br />This album takes a while to get used to, it changes quickly and frequently. John is an amazing drummer and I feel he is too overlooked and doesn't get the recognition he deserves. <br /> <br />The lyrics have a purpose, at times they will make you think, and at times they will make you laugh. These guys are serious, but don't take themselves too seriously. <br /> <br />In my opinion this is their best work and is a must-own for any Sytem fan or metalhead in general, though it may be a little too crazy for some people. <br /> <br />System of a Down on this album is: <br /> <br />Serj Tankian - Lead Vocals, Keyboards, String Arrangements <br />Daron Malakian - Guitars, Backup Vocals <br />Shavo Odadjian - Bass, Vocals <br />John Dolmayan - Drums
B00004Z400|5.0|Deftones really hit the nail on the head with their third record, White Pony. Here they emerged out of the quickly deteriorating nu metal scene as the clear masters and innovators of the style. Every track drips with gritty, atmospheric intensity and there's not a weak track in the batch.<br /><br />Chino's voice tends to be a dividing line, an acquired taste that serves to weed out the people who can't hang with Deftones' particular brand of musical anxiety. Once it grows on you though, it becomes clear how expressive and original he is. No one in the field of popular aggro bands can touch his use of dynamics or the agility with which he transitions between his chameleonic range of vocal styles. White Pony blows Chino's talent wide open. He's all over the place providing the most appropriate emotional nuances for the present moment, and nowhere is this more obvious than on tracks like the terrifying \\"Digital Bath\\" or catchy \\"Change In the House of Flies.\\"<br /><br />But it's not just Chino - every member of the band steps up to the plate in a big way on this album. The riffs and chords are more creative and hair-raising, the bass lines more serpantine, the drums more spastic, and the addition of a full time DJ adds a fifth layer to their already rich sound pallette. More than anything this record achieves a distinctly intense mood and atmosphere, something the Deftones hinted at on past records but hadn't fully realized until now. Somehow all the elements of that sound have come together here (probably in no small part from Chino writing more of the music.)<br /><br />There's nothing I could honestly pin down as a weak point on the record. Every song reaches its intended goal effectively. The heavier tracks are more creative and mature than anything previous to this record; it's beyond me how people who clamor for more \\"My Own Summer\\"s fail to notice the presence of glorious headbangers like \\"Korea\\" and \\"Elite\\". In contrast is the delicate \\"Teenager\\", originally intended to be released by Team Sleep. Sheets of brittle guitarstuff rain down on the listener from tracks like \\"Feiticiera\\".<br /><br />Speaking of which, by far the best version of the album opens with \\"Feiticiera\\" and closes with \\"Pink Maggit\\". The former is such a charged opening track and the latter is possibly the most beautiful song Deftones has written up to this point. The substitute opener, \\"Back to School\\", is a decent song but it suggests Around the Fur far too strongly and most of its best elements are used to much better effect in \\"Pink Maggit\\". The bonus track \\"Boys Republic\\" is fairly boring, a born B-side all the way.<br /><br />So original issue is the way to go, if you can find it. It's a concise and mature album like nothing the realms of modern popular metal can yet hold a candle to, maybe even including the Deftones themselves. A Mainstay of my record collection for a good 6 years now. It's uncomfortable, and so it should be, but every last note is worth the relatively small listening curve involved.lly intended to be released by Team Sleep.

B000002INR|5.0|THE BAND: Sebastian Bach (vocals), David Sabo (guitars), Scotti Hill (guitars), Rachel Bolan (bass), Rob Affuso (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1989) 11 tracks clocking in at approximately 39 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page foldout containing song credits/titles, song lyrics, one black & white band picture, and thank you's. All songs written by Skid Row members (though Sabo and Bolan wrote the vast majority; Bach has only 1 song writing credit on \\"Makin' A Mess\\"). Recorded at Royal Recorders in Lake Geneva, WI. Released 1/24/89. Label - Atlantic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: New Jersey's Skid Row put out an incredible first album amongst a sea of great pop/hair metal albums in 1989. Just to name a few of the others... Motley Crue (Dr. Feelgood), Whitesnake (Slip Of The Tongue), Mr. Big (Mr. Big), King's X (Gretchen Goes To Nebraska), Blue Murder (Blue Murder), L.A. Guns (Cocked & Loaded), Shark Island (Law Of The Order),  Enuff Z'Nuff (Enuff Z'Nuff), White Lion (Big Game), etc. Skid Row's debut contained the 3 necessary elements of any 80's hard rock hair album: 1. Numerous hard rocking tunes (my favorite track \\"Piece Of Me\\", \\"Midnight/Tornado\\", \\"Big Guns\\", \\"Sweet Little Sister\\"); 2. A couple of heavy hits (\\"18 And Life\\", \\"Youth Gone Wild\\"); and at least one mega power ballad (\\"I Remember You\\"). Skid Row's album was absolutely memorable - if not by Bach's trademark high pitched howl, then by the huge chart success of 3 distinct songs (mentioned above)... \\"18 And Life\\" (reaching #4 on Billboard), \\"I Remember You\\" (#6), and \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" (#99). I always remember singer Bach being at the center of controversy... saying things he probably shouldn't have said... as a whole, the band acting like the bad boys of rock (i.e. Guns 'N Roses). I did however like this album way before all the bad press though. It was a rocking in-your-face album with crunchy guitars, gritty vocals and catchy melodies. If you were into the hard rock scene in the late 80's, you HAD this album. *Other notably albums from Skid Row include \\"Slave To The Grind\\" (1991) and \\"Subhuman Race\\" (1995)... the latter of the two being an underrated heavy metal gem. Skid Row's debut is the place to start though (4.5 stars).. *Other notably albums from Skid Row include \\"Slave To The Grind\\" (1991) and \\"Subhuman Race\\" (1995)... the latter of the two being an underrated heavy metal gem.

B00004RF97|5.0|What's not to love about this movie. It fun, fast paced & fantastic.  The DVD looks like someone burned it on their home computer & LightScribed the label. But, if it was, they did a good job.  I was skeptic when I opened the case, but the quality is fine. No complaints here. <br />
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Not that she ever went away.  I loved \\"Girl In the Other Room\\" and her Christmas album.  But this is a return to the more traditional Krall many have come to know and love.  The album is top notch.  When you put together a band and production team like this one, you really can't go wrong.  Its a must purchase for the Jazz fan, or for that matter, any music fan at all.
B00005JJX8|5.0|Everybody knows the plot of this movie. So, I can't add anything in that respect. However, I can tell you that the quality of the DVD is very good. Clear picture and sound - great buy.
B000GFLKF8|3.0|It seems that Spike has grown up and is finally just making smart movies.  This heist movie is compelling and well played primarily because an interesting story is supported by interesting characters.  Lee has always put together an interesting visual product and he's finally made a movie that's not pedantic.  Learn as little as you can before watching to keep it fresh.  I won't purchase this or add to my Top 100, but this is as good as Topkapi.
B00000E2VC|5.0|The only fault I can find with this recording is the absence of MORE....more mazurkas, more ballades and more scherzi (Read:all the ballades and all the scherzi). Wonderful playing of Chopin, a composer of beautiful, radical, tempestuously tranquil piano music. Michelangeli is right inside this reportoire, and delivers a disc of music with and for many moods. A relatively expensive imported disc, this is essential listening if you are at all interested in Chopin's oeuvre.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is an exceptionally wonderful, entertaining film;  I've watched and enjoyed it many times, and my teen and 'tween daughters have also fallen in love with it.  The other reviewers have more than adequately described the outstanding performances of Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, and Johnny Depp.   One of my own favorites in the film, however, is Hugh O'Conor as the young parish priest, Pere Henri.  His rendition of \\"Ain't Nothin but a Hound Dog\\" (while working in his garden) is priceless.  Kudos also to Lena Olin in her role of Josephine, who evolves from battered wife to confident tavern owner.   I can't imagine anyone not loving and enjoying this movie.
B00005JP87|4.0|I saw this over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised.  Going in, I was expecting mainly a chick-flick (since my wife recommended it, and that's her main taste), and although this had a strong romantic theme it was anything but a chick-flick.  It's full of mystery, political intrigue, and plenty of suspense as well -- overall a very well balanced film.<br /><br />The feel and flavor of late-nineteenth century Vienna were very well done, particularly in the use of lighting and color (or rather, disuse of both elements -- lots of dark, drab scenes).  I thought Paul Giamatti was well cast as Chief Inspector Uhl, a man caught between his own ambitions and integrity.  I recently saw him as well in \\"Lady in the Water\\", and this newer role demonstrates his versatility as an actor.  Even better, I thought Ed Norton was excellent as Eisenheim, and got great support from Jessica Biel.  In my humble opinion only Rufus Sewell as crown prince Leopold was a little overdone, leaning disturbingly toward melodrama, but the other actors compensated nicely.<br /><br />As to the story itself, it has just enough of a blend of fairy tale, fantasy, realism and plausibility to appeal to a wide range of viewers.  The end offers a surprising twist that some may suspect but few fully understand or appreciate -- if they're honest about it.  Regardless of whether you can explain every detail, I think most of us will find this to be a very entertaining and enjoyable tale.
0131103628|4.0|Long ago this book was required in one of my undergraduate classes. At that time, I really could not find it easy therefore put it aside and used other books for the class. It seemed hard at that point. Many years later I bought and used the C Primer Plus book of  Stephen Prata which is an excellent book for beginning C. Later, I picked up this book from my library and looked at it, it seemed rather understandable and very good. I think this book is very good but beginner might find it hard to follow. I suggest you start with other books (I suggest C Primer Plus) and then come to this. It will be very beneficial that way.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana Krall is one of my favorite jazz singers.  The title track is the best in my opinion, but I love them all.  I think the trumpet playing compliments her vocals so well.  All of the musicians sound great on this CD.  It Could Happen To You is an excellent song about how people fall in love when they least expect to.  Exactly Like You and Isn't This A Lovely Day are two very good love songs.  Come Dance With Me is another gem on this disc.  Krall's vocals are so sensual and frisky here.  The track Little Girl Blue and Willow Weep For Me and How Insensitive are  standout songs.  I love them, because they sound so sad. I think Krall's vocals reflect a sense of loss and loneliness on these three beautiful tracks.  You Can Depend On Me is another highlight track.  This is a song about what it means to be a friend.  I love this new CD.

B000H7JD4A|4.0|The album provides a captivating listening experience. It is more melodic than the last album, \\"Dance of Death.\\" Some may see these songs as too sprawling and meandering but they are not that at all. To me, they are striking compositions and arrangments that happen to be long. The length of the songs is simply a canvas upon which the band paints its enchanting sonic landscapes. It also gives Maiden an opportunity to employ their trademark time changes, which are as engaging as they have ever been. Their chops are perfectly in tact. Bruce is a vocal phenomenon to behold. How he does it is a mystery. The band is incredibly tight, providing a furious, yet disciplined, sonic assault on the listener. The trio of guitarists effectively propel the tunes from beginning to end. The instrumental passages and fills are simply the sublime product of expert craftsmen. Of course, they remain masters of epic, musical and lyrical, narrative. They haven't simply aged gracefully but rather have matured like fine wine. With each new album (since Bruce's return), I find myself having more respect than ever for Iron Maiden's craftsmanship, musical sensibilities, and artistic creativity. They are simply masters of their craft.

B00005JN0T|4.0|I am extremely happy that someone undertook the task of bringing Asimov work to screen. No, it's not perfect, but the depth of Asimove work prevent that. <br /> <br />It is a good movie however, the scenario and dialogs are well thought out, the story is interresting, special effects are well made and, probably contrary to other opinions, I think Will Smith delivered a very solid performance bringing a \\"down to earth\\" tone to the movie which, otherwise, could have been a bit over the top. Bridget Moynahan was also very solid, on top of being a beautifull woman, so were the supporting actors. <br /> <br />I don't know who was responsible for the decors and background, but they are fantastic, so's the soundtrack. <br /> <br />I gave 4 star instead of 5 because, frankly, the ending was a bit to over the top, even for sci-fi. Perfect example of CGI taking over the scenario.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|Silent Hill has a lot of great special effects - which saves it from being a total waste of time. The story centers around a woman searching for clues to her adopted daughter's origins in an abandoned mining town called \\"Silent Hill\\".  <br /> <br />The movie takes the viewer on a tour of the wraith - filled town, that periodically morphs into a Hellish nightmare. The special effects are very interesting but the film does not have a cohesive ending and sputters to an confusing conclusion. <br /> <br />Silent Hill is not an awful film, but it is not a great film either.
B000GYI32M|4.0|I think Season 3 was a bit better than Season 2, where I  found the Ryan/Lindsay relationship boring (and implausible, when Lindsay is found to be Caleb's daughter) and just a way of filling in time before the Ryan/Marissa relationship resurfaced. Season 3 did at least focus more on the main characters. I'm glad that Marissa got killed off because I found her an increasingly stupid and unsympathetic character - everyone except her can see that Johnny and Volchek are no good for her and it will end in tears. It became predictable.  <br /> <br />I liked the way the Seth/Summer relationship was a constant. It was these two (plus the wonderful Julie) who provide the humour the show needs. <br /> <br />My biggest disappointment was that Ben Mckenzie's part was so underwritten. The show should return to focussing on him. That's where it started. The First Series was great, particularly the pilot where Ben did a marvellous job at showing a potentially complex and conflicted character, ranging from adolescent and broody to sweet and romantic. I believe Ben Mckenzie is an actor with great potential but this show is not stretching him. I'd like to see him speak more (not just through his eyes), express his character's views more clearly and really unlock emotionally. And give him more humorous lines! He is the lynchpin of the show, but sadly his role has been overshadowed by too many ephemeral and two-dimensional characters. Time for a new direction Josh, or don't be surprised if Mr Mckenzie moves on to better things.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|As you can tell by most of the reviews for this album, either people love it or it's not for them. <br /> <br />I heard and loved \\"Crazy\\" on the radio (like everyone else in the world...) but while previewing each track on Amazon I wasn't captivated.  However, I broke down and bought the album and I am so glad that I did.  The album is in my opinion the most creative album of 2006.  The sound is very urban/modern --- creative hip hop without all of the foul language and repetitive beats. <br /> <br />I rarely give any product 5 stars on Amazon, but this one certainly deserves it.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I've been a Bob Dylan fan for years. I love his old folksy tunes (Blonde on Blonde) and his mid career epic tracks (Hurricane, Tangled Up in Blue) and have overplayed most of the 3 disc Biograph for years. I've always been skeptical when legends come out with new albums way past their prime. Too many times i've gotten excited and been burned. For example, last year's Rolling Stone's album Bigger Bang was a huge disappointment. So when i heard there was a new Dylan album out, i was excited by skeptical. But, let me tell you - it's great. I think it's as good as his old stuff and possibly even better. Three tracks in particular stand out. The two bluesy and pumping tracks \\"Workingman Blues\\" and \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" and the beautiful meandering stroll of a song Spirit on the Water are all outstanding
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Probably like most people who have written reveiws on this album, I own all of John Mayer's albums because I absolutely love him as an artist.  His lyrics always cut to the heart, and even if it's a lighter song, I can always relate on some level to what he is singing about.  This album is no different, and by far my favorite album of his.  I can tell he has really matured, as his lyrics seem very personal and deeply emotional.  And out of all his albums I would say this is the most \\"bluesy\\" which is awesome.  What I love about him is that he can switch genres of music flawlessly (pop, blues, love songs/ballads) but never lose who he is as a musician and song writer.  This album is a must have!  If you truly appreciate John Mayer, then you will truly appreciate this very heartfelt and touching album.
B000002MP2|4.0|Let's get some things straight before we start, yes?  First off, I was in high school when the record released.  I bought it, ostensibly to give as a birthday present to somebody else I knew, but for complicated reasons ended up keeping it.  Over the course of the next few years, it was one of the few records I actually owned (hard to get those buggers when you don't have, you know, an income), so it got played a lot.  Quite a lot. <br /> <br />That said, I'd contend that it's a good piece of work, so far as it goes.  It pretty well represents the creative peak of this particular phase of Green Day.  The production is much more polished than Kerplunk (I can't listen to that record all the way through), the compositions are tightened up, and the entire record has a better quality of craftsmanship than anything the band had done before.  Similarly, starting immediately after this record, Green Day started branching off into the pop direction, obviously trying to exploit the unexpected foothold they'd gained, and drifted away from my taste.  After that, I pretty well lost interest, though I'm led to believe by the commercials I've seen for the award shows that their latest is better than I had come to expect. <br /> <br />This album plays almost like a collection of singles, which is good for it.  The worst crime that most \\"arty\\" music perpetrates is sacrificing accessibility (\\"listenability\\") in the name of artistic expression.  They are, unfortunately, the same thing when you're talking about a commercial forum like music.  This album is safe in that regard.  There's not a bad track on the record, by which I mean a track that I will reach over to the skip button when I'm in my car and jam it down because I don't want to have to sit through whatever's about to happen.  The overall sound is upbeat enough to tolerate a concentrated listen and the subject matter is at least honest enough to be relatable.  We're not talking about Chaucer here, but frankly who wants to listen to The Canturbury Tales anyway? <br /> <br />The album does have flaws, though, the primary of which is in the arrangement.  I could sit here and tell you that Green Day aren't the world's greatest musicians, but the only logical response to that is \\"No joke.\\"  I mean, this is ostensibly a branch of punk rock, which is not a genre famous for its musicianship.  No, no...my only real problem is that the record runs into some lulls between major release tracks, where the sound becomes a little homogenous.  Not as bad as Kerplunk, mind you (where you could hear the exact same riff in slightly different keys opening three different songs), but their management of tempo in the actual album assembly drags a little bit.  Not so bad I wouldn't recommend it, but the sort of problem a person looking for problems would fixate on. <br /> <br />I won't do a track by track listing, because I find the idea moderately silly and feel a little dirty for having done it myself in the past.  I'll just summarize it this way--the record is good enough that it ought to be in any collection of definitive or influential music, and has a place in most collections that include significant amounts of pop rock from the nineties.  For new listeners - if, in fact, there are any (I mean, this thing has sold a lot of copies, and I don't personally know many people who haven't already formed an opinion, but I am, as I mentioned before, biased by the relative timing of the record's release) - this is one of the best adventures into the realm of pop punk I've ever encountered.  It's not punk rock in the sense that traditionalists would recognize it (the compositions are far too accessible and not set at nearly the breakneck pace of, say, Minor Threat) and it's not hard rock in the sense that purists would recognize it (let's face it--these guys aren't THAT talented; I mean, they're competent, but there's not a Tom Morello among them).  It fits neatly into that sub-genre most folks call \\"pop punk\\" and it does so nicely. <br /> <br />It's a critical element of my music collection.  Worth a listen.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|Many bands out there start to suck after they release a second album. Avenged Sevenfold is on there third album and they just keep getting better. I REALLY REALLY recommend this album. I cant stand all those people who give bad reviews to bands that are awesome. I'm not just saying this because I like Avenged Sevenfold, it's obvious that many people also like Avenged Sevenfold. They did get the best new artist of the year award.
B00005JP8V|4.0|Finnish director Renny Hurlin has helmed numerous pictures since re-locating to Hollywood.  Among them are \\"Mindhunters,\\" \\"Exorcist: The Beginning AKA Exorcist 4,\\" \\"Die Hard 2,\\" & \\"The Long Kiss Goodnight\\" with Geena Davis & Samuel L. Jackson.  Enjoying pictures with a bit of magic, the supernatural or paranormal, \\"The Covenant\\" was a film I liked.  Screenwriter J.S. Cardone who's done quite a few \\"B\\" flicks including \\"The Forsaken\\" & \\"The Marksman\\" perhaps has a few too many characters floating in & out, but delivers enough story to let the actors show their wares and the special effects folks to go crazy as they climax.  Male model Steven Strait plays Caleb Danvers.  Strait was previously in \\"Sky High\\" & \\"Undiscovered\\" & plays the lead Son of Ipswitch in this film.  He comes across as a sympathetic good guy who treats his mother well, resists the dark side & likes the pretty girl.  Taylor Kitsch who was in \\"John Tucker Must Die\\" plays Pogue Perry, another of the sons.  In his first film, Toby Hemingway bares his backside in the boys' locker room and otherwise comes across as a rebellious teenager that we suspect as the bad guy for the middle part of the film.  Sebastian Stan in his first film -- a \\"Law & Order\\" episode being a previous credit -- plays the good-looking heavy Chase Collins who comes back to exact revenge on behalf of his ancestors.  He picks a fight in the locker room and makes jokes about the size of Aaron Abbott's private anatomy, which is a good way to pick a fight in a guy's locker room.  Kyle Schmid who was in \\"A History of Violence\\" plays the tough looking teen who can't withstand the magical punch of Collins.  When Collins knocks out lead Caleb Danvers in a swimming contest with a bit of the evil eye, the duel is set.  The two female leads who were both in \\"She's the Man\\" are Laura Ramsey who plays Sarah Wenham, Caleb's fancy and Jessica Lucas who plays Pogue's sweetheart Kate Tunney.  Chase shows what a bad guy he is with legions of spider tricks to bite and sideline the girls.  There are several scary scenes including a \\"Psyco\\"-like shower scene where the demonic blur breaks a light bulb and a glazed-eye darkling keeps popping up in the Sons of Ipswitch's dreams.  The Spencer Academy serves as a gothic setting filled with lots of rain, lightning and dark clouds.  When the climactic match occurs and Sarah floats amid a flaming barn, Caleb's mother Evelyn heads off to plead with Daddy Danvers to strengthen his boy's powers during the magical duel.  Wendy Crewson who has a long list of TV & film credits including a lead in the Canadian film \\"Suddenly Naked,\\" \\"Bicentennial Man,\\" & \\"To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday\\" plays the mother.  The film roars to its climax with Collins' body disappearing to leave just enough room for a sequel should this film do well at the box-office.  There are a lot of fresh faces -- not to mention fresh behinds -- in this film to probably launch a couple of careers as we look back a few years from now.  It's not a complex plot, but it was well done.  Enjoy!ricks to bite and sideline the girls.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Great album.  I love the old stuff and I absolutely love the new stuff.  There isn't one song on the album I dislike.  The new ballads are my favorite!
B0000542D2|5.0|The movie - as a movie - is excellent. This is what Beatlemania was to all of us. The movie won all types of industry awards and, for us kids at the time, firmly restated what we all knew: that the Beatles were sensational. <br /> <br />For some reason, Miramax saw fit to change out the original song soundtracks, replacing them with the record/CD versions. Apparently, Miramax has infinite wisdom. If they owned the rights to the Mona Lisa, they would probably believe her to be better as a blonde and make the change. <br /> <br />Despite the lack of the original and better blending of the original song versions, this is still worth seeing until the original is correctly restored. If you have never seen it and want to know what started the 60's musical (and cultural) rebellion, this version is ok to buy. If you want to replace an older VHS version, the image and dialogue will be better, but the songs are better on the non-Miramax versions.
0393307050|3.0|If you Buy \\"Master and Commander\\" expecting it to be the story in the Movie \\"Master and Commander:The Far Side of the World\\" you will be disappointed.  This is the First Novel in the series that introduces Jack Aubrey and Steven Maturin.    I found it to be a rousing historical novel in the Hornblower vein.  Jack leads the crew of the \\"Sophie\\" on many adventures in the Meditteranean of the Early Napoleanic Wars.  His many sucesses are outdone by his lack of tact around Superior officers.  Dr. Maturin is always around to provide a voice of reason and conscious to Jack's habits much like Jiminy Cricket to Pinochioo.      I found it to be a nice book but not as exciting as the Movie and like the movie it seems to end in the middle.  Only reccommended if you're prepared to read the whole series.
0783231202|4.0|What is the price one will pay for freedom ripped and seized from? It is a scenario that is presented by Stephen Spielberg's \\"Amistad\\"; when something so essential such as freedom is taken; the fight to regain it should understandably not be governed by rules. Freedom is a right all men and women are entitled to at birth or at least that is what all men and women should be entitled to. And for the pursuit of freedom one has to take into account drastic measures to regain it. Such is the case when over 40 men sold into slavery revolted against their owners off the coast of Cuba . Led by Sengbe Pieh or Cinque, the Africans eventually found themselves just off of Long Island . Their capture by U.S. authorities and their quarantine as their fate was put in limbo as abolitionists argued their case.<br /><br />As Cinque, relative newcomer Dijimon Hounsou portrays the leader of 40 men stripped of manhood and dignity. Hounsou further displays Cinque's strength in character which earned him strong conviction from the esteemed John Quincy Adams. The supporting cast, more notably Morgan Freeman and Matthew McConaughey round out strong players in the mix of things. Freeman's acting especially when he is confronted with the conditions of the Amistad slave ship is breathtaking.<br /><br />The justification of what men (for this example) would do for freedom is a strong argument John Quincy Adams gets across to the Supreme Court in the Amistad case argued February 22 - March 2, 1840. Anthony Hopkins brilliantly transforms himself into the aged politician and proves experience coupled with belief in a cause can bring out the very best out of an individual otherwise considered inactive.<br /><br />Sometimes lost in the shuffle of a tense period in U.S. History is the mutiny of the Amistad and the ruling to return the crew of West Africans back to their homeland. Certainly it is a chapter many never heard about in grade school to high school history books, but a key event that helped mold support for the cause of the abolition of slavery.at helped mold support for the cause of the abolition of slavery.
0670034711|5.0|This is a book that has changed my life. It helped me think about life and my way of living it in ways that made me feel happier and better able to go out and do the good things in the world that I want to do.<br /><br />Liz Gilbert takes us through her nasty divorce and subsequent worldwide travel to three places - Italy, India, and Bali, and in each place focuses on some aspect of life - food and enjoyment, spiritual discipline and joy, and finally, in Bali, love and balance.<br /><br />Being along for this journey was not only a delightful pleasure but also a thought-provoking and life-changing experience for me. I keep reflecting back on so many of the points she made and things that she learned and trying to apply them to my own life.<br /><br />This is definitely a book that I am buying extra copies to give out as Christmas gifts to my girlfriends, and it is one of my top three reads of the year.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|As described in every major publication, sounds a lot like early ZEPPELIN, SABBATH, with some proggy JETHRO TULL moments as well. A pretty enjoyable record - nice to see a retro/homage band that has some balls, and not based on the fey stylings of the post-punk/new wave revival (though I like some of those bands too).
B000EMGAOY|3.0|As a rule of thumb, I tend to be pretty wary of double albums-- they've got the habit of being self-indulgent disasters where a band has gained enough respect to be able to ignore the often sage advice of a producer who prevents bottom of the barrel scrapings from filling an album, and while the Red Hot Chili Peppers have habitually created long albums since beginning their partnership with stripped-bare producer Rick Rubin (off the top of my head, all of them over an hour), they've still maintained a high level of quality, and certainly the band's hit a renaissiance since the return of John Frusciante, and in my assessment \\"By the Way\\" was without a doubt the best thing the band's ever done, so I had pretty high hopes and expectations for \\"Stadium Arcadium\\". <br /> <br />It may be as a result of how much I loved \\"By the Way\\" that I found \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" a bit of a letdown when it came out-- in truth, a few listens later and I think a lot better of it now than I did of it then, but the record does stretch it's limits, there's maybe 90 minutes of worthwhile music on here-- a great batting average for a double album to be sure, but that means there's still a lot of what I would consider filler, and even some of the stuff I put in my three quarters good isn't fantastic (curiously enough, I found that some of the b-sides for the record are fantastic, which leads me to wonder whether some of the best material was intentionally held off).  The long story short is that there's more than enough on these two discs for just about anyone. <br /> <br />Before I go into details, one more thing-- this album does not sound like \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" or \\"Mother's Milk\\" or even \\"Californication\\".  If that's what you want, time to move on, the Chili Peppers are no longer for you. <br /> <br />The first disc, titled \\"Jupiter\\", gets off to a great start-- the first few tracks are just fantastic-- covering great funk rock in a Pixies-like arrangement (\\"Dani California\\"), superb balladry, whether it be just delicate and moving (\\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\") or overly melodramatic (\\"Stadium Arcadium\\") and a great, almost early-XTC, skanking guitar driven new wave piece (\\"Charlie\\"), but it slides after that, drifting from throwback funk (\\"Hump de Bump\\") to \\"Under the Bridge\\"-on-acoustic-guitars (\\"Slow Cheetah\\") or an array of so-so but not fantastic rock pieces (\\"Torture ME\\", \\"Wet Sand\\").  None of it's really horrible (well, \\"Strip My Mind\\" is pretty awful), but it doesn't stick out, particularly after the opening few cuts. <br /> <br />\\"Mars\\", the second disc, fares a bit better.  Like the first disc, it starts off fantastically-- big sound in a thin arrangement of \\"Descrecration Smile\\", funky beats, skanking guitars and sing-song chorus of \\"Tell Me Baby\\" and the simply lovely \\"Hard to Concentrate\\".  And like the first disc, it seems to drop in consistent quality after the first few tracks (\\"Readymade\\", \\"We Believe\\").  But unlike the first disc, the material fares a bit better, and there's some gems hidden amidst these-- from gentle ballads (\\"If\\") to ecstatic pop-rock (\\"Make You Feel Better\\"). <br /> <br />In the end, this really would have done better as a single disc-- the Chili Peppers have proven not adverse to holding back tracks-- this is a band that supposedly knocked off a dozen studio tracks in the sessions that produced two for the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album.  In the decision to create the sprawling two disc album, they end up with something that could have been a whole lot more.  Pare it down to your favorite dozen or so tracks, you've got a superb record that I'd've given five stars to, but as it is, there's too much that doesn't match up.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Every so often , a film is released that breaks all of the barriers and plunges deep beneath the power of cinema and spreads messages of hope in love. This isn't the film. \\" Brokeback Mountain \\" isn't a film that shows us something new. It isn't a film that provides a new message to the masses. This film's magic and strengths aren't in the message. This film's power is in the performances , cinematography , directing , and the unforgettable acting. Penned by Larry McMurtry ( Lonesome Dove ) and Diana Ossana , this film was highly anticipated to sweep the 2005 Oscars. It was well recieved and was in fact nominated for 8 Academy Awards. Ironically , it did win 3 Oscars but lost Best Picture to another phenominally well acted film , entitled \\" Crash \\". Personally , I belive that Heath Ledger should've recieved an Oscar for his performance as Best Actor. Originally , \\" Brokeback Mountain \\" was pegged as a gay cowboy flick. Even if it was , that still wouldn't be new. John Voight did a gay scene in 1969's \\" Midnight Cowboy \\" , Matthew Broderick did it in 1988's \\"Torch Song Trilogy \\", Harry Hamlin did it in 1982's \\" Making Love \\", Tom Berringer did it in 1977's \\" Looking for Mr. Goodbar \\", Robbie benson did it in 1976's \\" Ode to Billy Joe \\" , the late actor Brad Davis did it in 1978's \\"Midnight Express\\".Hollywood has done everything a million times. Nothing has been rediscovered or invented here. However , this film retells the power of love with a rare and unflinching sensativity. Just so happens that instead of \\"the poor boy that can't fall in love with the rich girl \\" , it's \\" the boy can't fall in love with the other boy \\". However , the unforgettable moments come from the actors and their stunning, sensitive,  and unforgettable portrayals. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, portray two cowhands , hired to watch cattle on a mountian , during the winter in the 1960's. Isolated , lonely , young , and reliant on each other in the rugged wilderness , the two begin a love affair that spans the rest of the their lives. Unfortunatly , their love has to remain a secret because of their own denials and the prejudices , fears , and ignorance towards homosexuality from outsiders. Ang Lee does a phenominal job at directing , Rodrigo Prieto does an unforgettable job as the film's cinematographer and Gustavo Santaolalla provides a musical score that will always be remembered in a haunting connection to the film. Persoanlly , I had my own prejudices towards the film , prior to me seeing it. However , I truly believe that this is a very rare film because it succeeds in telling a message that wouldn't normally be recognized in a typical love story. It spreads the awareness of ignorance and intollerance and ultimately makes it personal by illustrating the power of self destruction through fear and denial. \\" Brokeback Mountain \\" is an unforgettable film , and I highly recommend it. It does contain nudity , strong sexual content , violence and strong profanity and I don't recommend it for viwers under 18.ffair that spans the rest of the their lives.

B00008LDPU|5.0|I like the Animatrix very much. It is a wonderful walk through the world of the Matrix and it provides us with a history of the world leading up to the creation of the matrix. Some of the stories work well and some work less well, but the diversity of the visions is engaging. All the visions are quite short.<br /><br />In many respects, the Animatrix is better than the films, which seemed to get shallower and shallower as the story went on. The Matrix writers should have had a closer look at the works of William Gibson and other science fiction writers who have been dealing with VR worlds and realities for some years and doing it in a far more sophisticated way.<br /><br />Some of the animations in the Animatrix would have been even better if they were \\"fleshed out\\" into longer films, some are just right and a couple, like \\"World Record\\" could have been dropped completely with no real loss.<br /><br />I return to the Animatrix DVD often. The DVDs of the films, a lot less often.
B000096IBI|5.0|Charlie Chaplin.... you know, you just have to say his name and you start to smile.  He is just TO FUNNY.  The funniest parts are when he's in the feeding chair, and when he keeps tightening the bolts on everything, including that lady's buttons. haha and when he's in jail and walking around in circles.  My stomach hurt from laughing.  The 2nd part of this movie IS a little bit \\"slower\\" I have to admit.  I think the funniest stuff is the 1st half.  But overall, it's a FANTASTIC movie.  He is TRUE comedy!  A MUST HAVE!  :-)
B000EMH9D0|5.0|I am so tired of reading the bad reviews that the NY Dolls are getting on Amazon.  I discovered them while in junior high.  After that, I could not get enough of them.  It was clean enough so my parents let me listen to it but yet fun.  So that was punk rock.  That led me to Iggy Pop, Dead Boys, Sex Pistols, the ex-Dolls - Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, and progressively harder bands.  It got me through my teenage years.   <br /> <br />It is all on my ipod and when I need a good song to pick me up, I scroll over to the Dolls and play Trash, Pills, Personality Crisis, etc. <br /> <br />Those that snub the Dolls have no understanding of the impact they made in the early 70s.  Just look them up on Wikipedia.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I owe this one a few more listens but I don't think it'll do any good. Overall it's lazy and rather boring, which is a huge disappointment, considering how much I loved Lateralus, especially its more progressive passages. I'm all for long expansive prog explorations (PINK FLOYD, PORCUPINE TREE, SUBARACHNOID SPACE, GYBE), but the long, samey passages and filler on this record really go nowhere. Even the crescendoes, which take an eternity to get to, lack any real catharsis. Aside from (sadly familiar) high points like Vicarious or The Pot, listening to this has been a real chore. Too bad. 2.25/5.
B000H305U0|3.0|I actually give this album 3.5 stars out of ten but if I was 16-18 (I'm 41) I'd probably give it 4 stars easily. Anyway here goes:- FS/LS starts off with..FS/LS. It sounds like Justin's version of 'Faith' George Michael singing INX's 'Need you tonight'. A great vibe and groove...until those keyboards KICK in...wtf?? Takes the edge of that track for me. 8 - Half point dropped cos of those keyboards! <br /> <br />Sexyback - Good simple track. Kind confused me relegating Justin to a repetitive backing line on the chorus. Is it his song or Timbalands? Just a bit to repetitive for my tastes and don't think we'll be listening to it as a classic in years to come. Also don't like the gimicky 'you ready' hook.  8 <br /> <br />Sexy Ladies - Princes - the Time 7.5 <br /> <br />My love - Yep this works. 9 <br /> <br />Lovestoned - Love the instant groove. Nsync on steriods. 9    <br /> <br />What goes around - Begins like something off of Nelly F's (also timbaland produced) album and ends up as a clear Aaliyah melody. He's been over this subject matter almost EXACTLY before, lovely vibe though. 8.5   <br /> <br />So ultimately, we've ended up with a very good first half of the album - it's the second half where we seem to lose momentum... <br /> <br />Chop me up - Don't appreciate this very banal generic rap and definitely don't appreciate the southern rappers on this one.And don't get me started on Will.I.am terrible contribution-is this guy bloated with complacency or what?! 7 <br /> <br />Damn Girl - Average hardly innovative dance track which highlights Justin average lyrical ability. Nice chorus melody though. 7  <br /> <br />Summer love - Ok track, some nice sounds but Jeez, the repetition of the word 'girl' drives me crazy - vocal arrangement lifts the track. 7  <br /> <br />Until the end of time - Deep breath... Justin rips off R kelly style R & B, via Ushers 'Do it to me' last album vocals with Prince textures in the background. Genuwine also throws his oar in just sothe party doesn't get too lonely. It's kinda strangely amusing. I mean you could never see MJ taking off a Prince track at the height of their rivalry would you now. Usher must either be flattered, amused, irritated or a combination of the three! 7.5 <br /> <br />Losing my way - Should have really re-done those lyrics and the verse melody. Sounds like a 13 year old who's just written his first few songs. 7 <br />(Another song) - Slowie by numbers. Heard it ALL before in many different songs. 7 <br /> <br />Pose - Prince 'Lady cab driver' style backing track. banal Lyrics. 7 <br /> <br />So we really have an average second half album. Funnily enough the impeccable influences JT has so readily (and obviously) ripped off means his young fans 13-16 will be enjoying his watered down versions of late 70's early 80's classics as they won't know any better. I'm sure Timbaland is snowploughing money into the bank but surely the guy is creatively overstretched at this point? Bearing in mind Justin's limited creative talent I'm sure he would have benefited from not doing the whole album with essentially one person!  Basically, this album has nice melodies and will sell due to his main fan demographic but to me, is not as charming or 'solid' as 'Justified' - minus it's own two filler tracks, of course. Strangely enough, Justin's lyrical approach is more like an 18 year old than 25 year old. Popstar bubbles and all that, I guess! It all leaves me placing Justin as the megastar who is there at the right time and has JUST enough of all you need to elevate him to a higher status than the true reality of his actual talent. That said, apart from Usher (on a similar level) who else is there? Lucky JT!   <br /> <br />  <br />
B0000C6DWU|5.0|\\" Finding Nemo \\" , is a film that I've highly enjoyed and found it surprising that I didn't review it before now. Luckily , I caught it last night on the Disney channel and I relived those unforgettable and funny moments all over again. My son was born in 2003 , and this was the first film that I took him to see. So , yes , I am very partial to it. The script is highly creative and improved alot by the actors and it supports layers of interesting dialog and situations for the characters. The plot is simple and easily understandable for children. \\" Finding Nemo \\" reminds me of those programs like the original Three Stooges,  Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry , in the sense, that children and adults, alike, will find this film ,highly entertaining. There's been alot of filmmnakers trying to capture the same essence of \\" Finding Nemo\\". However , they have failed to capture both the adult element and children element. However , Pixar has captured this essence and balanced it perfectly.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Irreversible sparked my interest because several politicians in Australia wanted to have it banned here. I wanted to know why I shouldn't be allowed to see this film.<br />The device of running each of the scenes in reverse order is an effective one in this film and it reverses \\"causality\\" and we see the results of a situation before we film out what caused it.<br /><br />We meet Monica Bellucci's boyfriend and their mutual friend early in the film and I thought that they were a couple of sick, testosterone driven criminals.... However, slowly, but surely, we discover the horrible truth - that a brutal and inhuman act of violence towards Monica Bellucci has pushed them over the edge.<br /><br />We step deeper and deeper back in time and learn that the trio of friends were leading a happy bohemian life. We finally find Monica Bellucci in the final (first) scene peacefully ready a book on the grass of a park, children a playing nearby and the Allegretto from Beethoven's 7th Symphony is playing in the background. The music brings us both peace at the end of this film and also reminds us of the tragedy we have just witnessed.<br /><br />Irreversible is a difficult film. It is difficult to watch and difficult to consider. It shows us entropy - of time, relationships, beauty and idealism. I guess it also shows us that extreme situations can push normally decent human beings into barbarism.<br /><br />I don't think I would or could watch Irreversible again any time soon. However, I am glad that I've seen it and I certainly don't think it should have been banned.<br /><br />Please understand that this is a very adult movie and it certainly isn't for everyone. Irreversible is a very confronting experience. I haven't made up my mind yet about the importance of that experience.
B000000W5P|5.0|It is easy now to take critical shots at The Rolling Stones because the quality of music has tailed off drastically since the latter 1970s. But I give the band credit for soldiering  into the studio before touring and simply not becoming a \\"Greatest Hits\\" package every couple of years before a live audience.<br /><br />But with that said, the last great album worth of material was Some Girls. The production was pared down and the arrangements showed the influence of Mick Jagger picking up the vibe from the New York City new-wave/punk clubs.<br /><br />From the funk of Miss You to the punk of Shattered, it is no wonder why the LP surged to the top of the album chart in the U.S. and number two in the UK in 1978.<br /><br />The rocking When The Whip Comes Down gives way to a nod to Motown, Just My Imagination. The controversy surrounding Some Girls and the country hoedown of Far Away Eyes has Jagger firing off some of his best ironic lyrics ever.<br /><br />Keith Richards takes an outlaw rocker stance in Before They Make Me Run and the opening riffs to Beast Of Burden remain a rock classic.<br /><br />Some Girls may not your first stop in building a collection of Stones' CDs. But it is an essential part in appreciating the power of the band that has stood the test of time.
0618680004|2.0|With so much pre-publicity hype, I had expected to find a book that was highly controversial and offensive (at least to those who are religious.) But the most hostile part of the book is its title.  Indeed, had he chosen a different title (say, for example, \\"The Evolution of God Beliefs\\"), he would be far more likely to reach the audience he said he was writing for: those who unquestioningly put their faith in a Judeo/Christian God. But if you can get past the occasional callous remarks, Dawkins provides some rare and welcome gems of insight into the nature of religious ideology.<br /><br />First, because he is British, he has the ability to see aspects of American religiosity that most of us can't see because we are swimming in the midst of it. For example, in Chapter 1 (A Deeply Religious Non-Believer), Dawkins rightly points out how Americans unconsciously shy away from being critical of Christianity, as if to do so would be a defilement of some sacred space.  We have no trouble criticizing members of the opposing political party; why should religious beliefs be similarly exempted?  Dawkins even points out how the Supreme Court has supported a double standard when it deals with prejudices disguised as religious belief.<br /><br />Another example of his British insightfulness fills the pages of Chapter 2 (The God Hypothesis). He cites examples from our own Founding Fathers showing that they clearly did not intend to create a nation \\"under God.\\" He references a 1797 diplomatic document, signed by John Adams, stating that \\"the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian Religion.\\" Other shocking tidbits included quotes from Jefferson (\\"Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man\\"), Franklin (\\"Lighthouses are more useful than churches\\")and others. Dawkins thus provides an invaluable service by reminding us that right-wing conservatives often distort our country's history. (I was also surprised that he did not speak ill of Buddhism or Confucianism, seeing them more in the light of secular philosophies.)<br /><br />Chapter 4 (Why There Almost Certainly is No God)provides an excellent Darwinian explanation for the emergence of religious ideology, a view that many religious people should find intriguing and not insulting to their faith. But the rest of the chapters, in my opinion, become increasingly superficial and weak. His comments on fundamentalism seemed so shallow that I came away from the book with a sense that he makes no distinction between the handful of (admittedly powerful) nutcases and the vast majority of religious leaders who insist upon religious tolerance and open-mindedness. In fact, I found his dismissal of religion so impoverished that I and Andrew Newberg used our forthcoming book,HOW GOD CAN CHANGE YOUR BRAIN, to neuroscientifically demonstrate the values inherent in spiritual practice (I too wanted to attact fundamentalism, but the evidence wasn't there to support it; angry rhetoric is the villian, not religious beliefs per se).<br /><br />In his chapter on morality, he does not mention the huge amount of sociological, neurobiological and psychological research that demonstrates our instinctive capacity to act morally without the aid of religious belief (in biology, many animals also demonstrate moral and cooperative traits because they are survival enhancing to the individual and group). Chapter 9 (Childhood, Abuse and the Escape from Religion)has similar weaknesses, and to anyone familiar with childhood development literature, Dawkins' discussion will seem dismissively superficial. For a good overview of the neuroscience of morality, child development, and fundamentalism, see our book [[ASIN:0743274970 Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth]].<br /><br />All in all, I found this book to be less satisfying than Dawkins' other works. Dawkins is a weaver of great stories, but this isabsent in this volume. However, it takes great courage to directly confront religious beliefs, and his book has helped a lot of people who don't believe in religion to speak more freely about their secularism. Imagine that? A country that is tolerant towards atheists and believers alike--that, I think, is what our Founding Fathers created.s great courage to directly confront religious beliefs, and his book has helped a lot of people who don't believe in religion to speak more freely about their secularism.

0446677450|5.0|Basically, this book gets me started on what I am doing today.  Real estate is not the only mean suggested by Robert K., he also suggests people who wants to be rich to start their own businesses.  i.e. be in the quardant that let you in control of your cashflow, not expecting cashflow to be the same as an employee working for another person's dream and instead of your own. <br /> <br />Also, hold assets that generate passive income for you, not liabilities that suck your hard-earned money fast!! <br /> <br />Boy, had I read this book a few years earlier, I could have done much better today.  Yet, no total regret, later is better than never!  This is the only book which has succeeded in getting me started on my own business.  This book is the first one of the series of \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\\"  It is very inspirational and it does succeed in getting me started. <br /> <br />Thank you so much Robert.  Looking forward to your next seminar as well. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Raymond
B000H305U0|5.0|This album is just fantastic. Timbaland once again drops the album of the year, 2006 is definetely turning out great for him. JT is on top of his game better then ever in terms of knowing how to effectively use his voice. Anyone who reviews this and doesn't like it just shouldn't even review it at all, because you're holding on to some preconcieved idea of what you want music to be, and you're wasting the time of everybody who just wants an honest review. This album will win many awards, don't forget that.
B00070DK5K|5.0|I didnt think Bowie could outdo the studio versions of Sweet Thing (it actually smells like a street)and Cracked Actor...but he actually has here. Incredible live recording....And the live version of Aladdin Sane is just stupendous...This new remix is a little odd to me. It sounds totally remixed (vocals up, drum up, guitar down, etc.) being I'm so used the previous mix. But it's such a fabulous live album (one of the BEST in my opinion) that any and all mixes/tracks are welcome! This is the live Bowie to get. (well the Ziggy tour live album is hot also).
B000FQJAIW|1.0|Leaving all the technical arguments aside as they have been discussed to death all over the place....... <br /> <br />Star Wars is among the top flims on anyones list of the best movies of all time. Its listed at #15 by AFI... quite high considering the competition. Psycho is #18, which I think is a better movie but I digress.  So wanting a fully restored and un-edited Star Wars is not like wanting a restored \\"Them!\\" (a fun movie btw). <br /> <br />By comparision, The Godfather has also been re-edited a couple of times since its original release. But interest in the originals was high (just like it was with SW) and they were carefully cleaned then transfered to DVD with great success. The trilogy is available here pretty cheap. I recommend getting it. Just dont forget the cannoli. <br /> <br />So when fans (and there are many) see things like this, they dont understand why this movie doesnt get the same treatment. There is already a beautiful restoration. The only thing that needs to be done is to replace about two minutes of screen time. Working with the raw material that was used for the parts with the added special effects should be no problem. Supposedly that two minutes no longer exists. But fans consider that argument disingenuous. They say they must exist somewhere. Perhaps a set of the first movie reels in a private collection? Certainly a better option than using the last laserdisc footage. <br /> <br />Why the big deal? It all depends on what a movie really is. Is it mass media? Or is it a work of art? Film makers most often say its the latter. If so, then art restoration means bringing out the original work as much as possible. I suppose The Who could rerecord parts of Tommy and remove the original from ever being distributed again. <br /> <br />What will I do? Online rentals are great. Especially for DVDs that might be watched once a year.
B00003CX5P|2.0|What the Hell happened to Lucas? <br /> <br />How could he go from a wordy but brilliant writer/director to a creator of this dross?  In recent years, I've decided that I've been too harsh on my initial views of \\"Phantom\\" (I guess seeing where he was finally going in \\"Sith\\" made me appreciate the little things in here more), however, this reassessment has NOT made me decide this film was in any shape \\"good\\" or measured up to \\"Star Wars.\\" <br /> <br />Where to begin?  Well, let's start with the bad.  Lucas has obviously fallen in love with what can be done with CGI.  The special effects in here, like the trial balloon effects he did in the reedited first trilogy, are breathtaking.  He seemed to forget, however, that jaw-dropping vistas and lifelike illusions are no replacement for characters we care about and plot that actually make sense.  A lot of people blame poor Jake Lloyd for being a bad Anakin, but he was all of 8 when \\"Phantom\\" was made.  It was also his first major movie.  A good director can make a zucchini passable and a child actor good.  Lucas dropped the ball with him, though, and without proper mentoring, he probably felt like a real-life Dorothy dropped in an Oz not of his own making. <br /> <br />Oh, yes, let's not leave out the dialogue.  Lucas has been known for his \\"wordy\\" characters, but here we go over the top with whole technobabble soliloqueys about \\"Midichlorians\\" and the Sith \\"having (their) revenge\\" with no subtext, no connection with any past that an \\"extended universe\\" virgin would undertand.  And the hints of racism that permeate the whole production (the \\"chinee waiter\\" Trade Fed leader Neomoideans were only a start) hint at darker things to come, such as Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br />Ah, Jar Jar Binks.  The Ugly.  Entire books have been written trying to surmise just what the Hell Lucas was thinking when he put this Stepinfechit/Mushmouth lovechild so prominently in an important chapter of his story.  I have to admit that the CGI on himwas first-rate - he really seemed to be with the human characters - yet he really was a horrorshow, as he mirrored all those happy, bouncing \\"House Negro\\" characters so prominent in '30s film.  One has to wonder what photos of Ahmad Best Lucas has in his office safe to make him go along (and defend in interview after interview) with bringing Binks to shuffling \\"mesa okey-day boyos\\" life.  And I was unfair to Bill Cosby's beloved character by comparing him with Binks, but really, doesn anyone even KNOW what the heck he's saying?  Even Lucas probably isn't sure. <br /> <br />After all that crapping on \\"Phantom\\" (sorry if it was a bit much, but when I saw it in the cinema, I had such high hopes for it and they were bitterly shot down in flames, so it's hard to be kind), you'll probably wonder just what I see \\"good\\" in it.  Well, actually, quite a lot - not \\"whole film\\" quantities, but enough to keep me from attempting to leave a \\"zero\\" as my rating.  I can't deny the beauty of Lucas's worlds, even the desolate Tattoine, and he really knows how to create action sequences (the lightsabre duels and podrace sequence did recapture some of my childhood \\"wow\\").  The occasional bit of slapstick does bring a giggle to me, when they're not overused (too many flatulence/gas gags).  But what saves the film is the cast.  And what a cast it is - Ewan Macgregor as a youthful Obi-Wan, Liam Neeson as the grumpy-yet-caring Qui-Gon, and the beautiful Natalie Portman as Padme'.  Brilliant and able to make us care about our folks despite - not because of - Lucas's hackwork. <br /> <br />So, the bottom-line; is it essential?  I'd have to say, very-reluctantly, yes.  We get to see the development of a sarcastic apprentice Obi-Wan and know he wasn't always all-wise.  We get to see Qui-Gon bucking the Jedi system and showing a depth of compassion for his charges we'd need another half-hour of film time anywhere else (and with anyone else other than Neeson).  And we get to see the last, painfulmoments of innocence from Anakin Skywalker (please, again, give young Jake a break.  I thought he did well with what he had) before the coming fall.
0143034901|5.0|I saw this book at my local book store and was attracted by the cover. I really, really loved the book! The caharcters are great, especially the enigmatic, wise,crack up Fermin! The story gets a little predictable in the end, but it is still very enjoyable! I also liked the description of Barcelona during the spanish war and what people had to endure in those years...<br /><br />Final note, I think that the translator did a terrific job!! He's partly responsible if this book is very good!
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Great DVD. Great sound (recorded levels are a bit high on my EQ, but I like it that way and there's no distortion). The sound is really incredible, booming, thunderous drums. You can here Myung pretty good. The Petrucci shines. Lebrie doesn't miss a note. Jordan is fabulous (although a bit over the top on the Octavarium into). The orchestra was very fitting, however does anybody notice that the violins seem to be just a tad flat? Especially noticable right at the beginning of the 6DOIT Overture. When the rest of the band plays it's basically unoticable. It's very subtle no doubt.  <br /> <br />Highlights? All of 6DOIT...Octavarium...the encore....Root of all Evil.  <br />   <br />
0743457900|5.0|Another great read from John le Carre.  Although, not my favorite of his books, if you like spy novels and his character, George Smiley, you will enjoy this book.
B00005JP4U|5.0|I took my ten year old to see this documentary, and his jaw was, literally, hanging open throughout. From the indisputable data showing exactly what's happening to the CO2 and its direct relationship to global temperatures, to the images of the Aral Sea and receding glaciers, he sat fascinated -- and appalled. At the end he turned to me and said, \\"How come I'm just a kid, and I understand what's going on, but grownups like President Bush and Prime Minister Howard don't?\\"<br /><br />Good question. For those still confused by the science, and, just as importantly, the agendas, regardless of your politics, take a couple of hours to see this documentary. This is not the wooden Al Gore of the 2000 Presidential campaign, but a man who, having freed himself of political obfuscation, impassioned by a need to save, quite literally, human civilization, has distilled the complex and provable science of climate change into a remarkably clear and compelling multimedia presentation that even a child can comprehend. Gore lost the battle for the Presidency, but we can only hope that he does not lose the greater battle to save ourselves from ourselves. As so clearly demonstrated in those same elections, the votes -- and actions -- of every single last one of us count. Go see the movie, learn how we can be part of the solution, not the problem, because none of us can afford to stick our heads in the sand any longer.
B000EULJLU|2.0|After listening to Vicarious and The Pot, I was convinced this cd would be worth owning. Much to my disappointment, very few tracks on this cd were even bearable. I found myself wondering if Tool is attempting (and failing) to sound like Pink Floyd?? Vicarious is a great track followed by aimless rambling tracks that never seem to end soon enough. Time to stop experimenting with mellow and strange concepts and get back to rock! The Native American chant tunes haven't worked for others (like Creed) yet everyone feels they must try it. I will add two or three tracks to my MP3 collection and then use this one as a coaster...
B000FQJAIW|1.0|All I can say is Skip this one.! <br /> <br />Disc 1 is the same as the one in de box set. So no added value there. <br /> <br />And disc 2 is not even enhanced for 16:9 tv. So if you have de original Laser Disc box set with the 9 CAV discs you will not find any added value here. <br /> <br />So save hour money and wait for the re-re-re-re-re-release on HD-DVD. <br />
0743442539|5.0|This is a \\"must-read\\" for spy novel enthusiasts.  It is at the top of his novels that I have read.
0393061434|5.0|Steve Wozniak (with the obvious and very able assistance of Gina Smith) has written a gem of a book in iWoz.  This book is literally for everyone, techies and non techies alike, as the Revolution created by Mr. Wozniak and Steve Jobs truly changed our world.  I have often thought of the two as highly different individuals brought together in a common cause with radically different skill sets.  Cast The Woz as John Lennon and Steve Jobs as Paul McCartney.  Lennon wanted to CREATE something special, something beautiful and something new. Wozniak clearly did this at Apple.  McCartney wanted to become huge, well known and wealthy. Jobs did this for all at Apple, very much including the author as Wozniak had other motivations that occupied his very busy mind. Mr. Wozniak does write, very interestingly, about the engineer as an artist.  He really thinks of it that way.  Any who have heard him speak or met him, as I have been fortunate enough to do on a few occasions, know that what he wrote was, and is, the real Steve Wozniak.  Ms. Smith did a marvelous job at making the book almost entirely understandable to those of us whose minds are not wired as an engineer.  Yet it is the voice of Mr. Wozniak that comes through.  Truly a remarkable accomplishment as Wozniak can ramble yet, in this wonderful autobiography, his thoughts are cogent and clear.  Even concise.<br /><br />This book is a great read for all.  It shows what passion can create.  Buy it, read it and give it to all your family and friends to read.
B000H305U0|4.0|I have to admit that I am a fan Justin's music, so people may think my review may be biased but I know good music when I hear it and FutureSex/Lovesounds is a must have! Justin and Timbaland together are a dynamic pair and they definitely brought the best out of each other on this album. It is definitely a far cry from his solo debut \\"Justified\\", but this album proves Justin Timberlake as a legitimate artist and a force to be reckon with. Listening to the the cd it is hard to deny that Michael Jackson and Prince are major influences but Justin does a wonderful job of putting his signature stamp on the album.Definitely one of those albums you can listen to from finish to end.
B000FQJAIM|5.0|In 1977 I saw episode 4 in a Pittsburgh movie theatre.  I left that theatre a changed boy.  I waited patiently for each sequel.  I was blown away by each one.  Now let's fast forward to 2004.  I spent my money on the 2004 box trilogy.  George Lucas, you are the anti-christ!  It is agreed that Episodes 1, 2, and 3 were disasters BUT at least he could have released the original theatrical versions of episodes 4,5, and 6.  Thank God I own an original copy of \\"The Warriors\\" BUT that is another story.  Since I'm on the topic, will someone please pay Mike Tyson to punch Walter Hill in the mouth, as hard as he can.  Anyway, in 2004, Lucas seemed hell bent on estranging the true Star Wars fan.  Fast Forward to September 2006.  While holding out hope that I would find the Criterion version of John Woo's \\"Hard Boiled,\\" I found the original theatrical release of Episodes 4, 5, and 6.  Phew!!!  I'm still hearbroken over that whole \\"The Warriors\\" director's cut disaster.  I'm sorry, I went off on a tangent, didn't I?  I'm going to buy a second set of these Star Wars DVD's simply because Lucas can't be trusted.  Remember Jar Jar Binks?  How about Greedo shooting first?  'Nuff said.  True fans know the deal.  We all got burned when we bought the 2004 release of the trilogy.  Why George? Why?  The original theatrical DVD's does not absolve poor Lucas of his prior sins (Episodes 1-3, and the 2004 DVD trilogy disaster) BUT it will shut me up for awhile.  These releases have also taught me something.  \\"Director's Cut's\\" usually suck.  Let us all pray that Abel Ferrara does not have a \\"Director's cut\\" of \\"King of New York.\\"
B000FZETKC|3.0|I do not  know what is is about this movie...it casts some type of strange hypnotic spell over me!<br /><br />The plot is a recycle of numerous other \\"get the girl even know she's to good for you\\" yet I find the story invigorating. Its just about a every day, un popular kid (Eric Stolz) from a family of humble finances who gets the courage to ask the most popular and cutest girl out on a date. He wants to impress her to show that he is good enough for her.<br /><br />The characters are all wooden stereotypes with no development yet I root and hiss at them<br /><br />The soundtrack is soooooo 1980's yet the songs make me move and gyrate, especially the new wave-ish \\"Falling in Love\\"<br /><br />The ending is anti-climatic yet there is a certain charm to the \\"what the heck\\" attitude about the movie...like it does not need any type of climax.<br /><br />One of the reasons this movie works is b/c of the actors. Eric Stolz was way too nice of a guy, he never conveyed what he was feeling, yet you want him to succeed. He is immensely likeable.<br /><br />Craig sheffer makes a great smarmy rich kid villain.<br /><br />Mary Ann Stuartson was unbelievable in her role yet she still had a lot of charisma.<br /><br />Lea Thompson plays, what essentially was for the world of the movie, the most beautiful girl in the high school yet she's not that cute (go figure)<br /><br />The supporting cast added good comic relief especially the blue collar Dad, social status concerning sister.<br /><br />In summary, this movie makes a perfect guilty pleasure. John Hughes was a master of his craft in creating the teen angst film. His characters never were invloved in  life threatening issues...justteh day to day tribulations of being a teenager.<br /><br />I can rip this movie over and over again yet I have also watched it numerous times. It grows on you.<br /><br />I give it a (delayed) thumbs up. The flick gets better with each viewing.
6304698623|5.0|Watch this movie with your family. Watch this movie by yourself. Watch this movie before you go to bed. Watch this movie with your sister! Quite simply watch this movie!  <br /> <br />This movie represents the beauty of childhood innocence, the value of morality and the ability to hope! You will fall in love with the way the young princess sees the world and hope that you might one day see the world with that type of innocence, and that type of love.  <br />
1400062756|5.0|That the way we look upon phenomena can have drastic consequences has been known for a long time. It has now been demonstrated that the same goes for intelligence.<br /><br />This book by Carol Dweck demonstrates, on the basis of good research, that what people think about their own intelligence has far-reaching consequences. Dweck shows that people with a so-called FIXED MINDSET, who see intelligence as unchangeable, develop a tendency to focus on proving that they have that characteristic instead of focusing on the process of learning. They tend to avoid difficult challenges because failing on these could cause them to lose their intelligent appearance. This disregard of challenge and learning hinders them in the development of their learning and in their performance. So it actually hinders them in developing their knowledge, skills and abilities.<br /><br />However, when people view intelligence as a potential that can be developed, this is called the GROWTH MINDSET, this leads to the tendency to put effort into learning and performing and into developing strategies that enhance learning and long term accomplishments. An implication is that it pays off to help children and students invest in a view of intelligence as something that can be developed. Carol Dweck does not deny that people differ in their natural abilities but she stresses that it is continued effort which makes abilities blossom. Children who have learned to develop a growth mindset know that effort is the main key to creating knowledge and skills.<br /><br />Fortunately the growth mindset can be taught to people. People who were trapped in a fixed mindset can be freed from it and start building their intelligence. If you are a teacher or a parent you would be wise to take good notice of this message and maybe buy this book. the book contains some good examples of how to help children learn how important it is to work and learn. But really anyone could learn from it.
B000G75AE8|1.0|any real Slayer fan who has followed their career would agree that there was no effort put into this album.     before you disagree listen to the damn thing, it sux. sample before you buy, trust me, even though most will find out the hard way.    the lyrics are the same old slayer lyrics except chewed up and pooped out on this album.    there are some ok riffs on this album but most of them are boring as hell and the solos are jeff and kerry's worst yet.    drumming is ok, but nothing and i mean nothing compaired to daves other work.    this whole album is lazy and was only put out there for money. im sure their will be a lot of kids who are new to slayer and metal and think wow what an awesome album, but its not.     i would still reccomend any other slayer album, but any more good tunes from slayer may be the real illusion.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is by far, the best show I've ever seen. I just finished watching the unfinished season and the movie Serenity. I already miss the characters. This is a must have for my DVD collection. I could watch this over and over.
B000G759LW|4.0|I'll begin by saying that this is a good cd. Will you like every song? Highly unlikely, but you will yourself randomly humming some songs, and just finding pure enjoyment in others. I love Christina as an R&B singer, I think it suits her well, some of her best R&B showings are \\"Understand\\", \\"On our Way\\", and \\"Without You\\".  You will be surprised at the level of restrain she shows on some of these songs.  This is not to say she doesn't oversing, because she has her fair share of oversinging, but I'm not mad at her for it.  The instrumentation and sound of the first disc is seamless and cohesive, but if you're a big fan of the first disc, you may have some problems with the second disc.  The sound is completely different with the exception of a few songs. It tends to go back and forth with no common ground.  <br /> <br />\\"Candyman\\" is incredibly catchy with complex barbershop harmonies and although I didn't like \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" at first, I found myself going through my house singing \\"You've been a bad, bad boy...\\" I like it now- both these songs have an older vibe, not quite the time period she was aiming for, but close enough.  \\"Hurt\\" is one of her typical, beautiful Christina ballads, and she does it proud. The reason I take away a star is because of her oversinging on the songs \\"Mercy on Me\\" and \\"Right for Me\\".  It is entirely way too much for me to listen to, but the subject matter is important to her, and she could have tried to get her point across in a different manner- preferrably not as loud.  The best reason for the existence of the 2nd disc for me is the showstopper \\"Save Me From Myself\\", this song is like feeling a piece of Christina's soul. This song is perfect, it is just her...exposed and vulnerable, and absolutely stunning.   <br /> <br />Some people have qualms over her singing about her husband, but I would not expect any less of her.  Artists should talk about what matters to them, and this man changed her life.  Did I get sick of it? Yes, but Iunderstand that she has dealt with her other issues which we became well versed in from \\"Stripped\\" and she has taken a different approach to life because of the way this man has given her perspective.  I am proud of her, I have always been her fan, and it has been a joy to see her grow, and I cannot wait for the next step in her life. <br /> <br />My Highlights <br /> <br />Makes Me Wanna Pray <br />Ain't No Other Man <br />Understand <br />On Our Way  <br />Without You <br />Save Me From Myself <br />Hurt
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Excellent follow up to the series. I had missed the characters and loved seeing them again. Also liked that they were able to tie up some loose ends. Of course, I would have liked to have seen Mal end up with Inara.
0143036742|4.0|Although this is Marina Lewycka's first novel, she has six previous books to her credit - and when you see their titles (\\"Choices for the Carer of an Elderly Relative,\\" \\"What to Do and Who to Turn to (Caring in a Crisis)\\" and others from that ilk), you can clearly see that her experience in elder care is what has shaped the outlines of this work.  But embedded in here are a number of interesting tales: there's the father getting old and rather irrational and how the family copes with that; there's the Eastern European young bride and the resulting West/East culture clash; there's the Big Sister / Little Sister rivalry (which takes an expected turn at the end when Bis Sister's secrets are slowly revealed); and there's something quite unexpected about World War II and its effects on families.<br /><br />In fact, the book's real triumph is how it sneaks up you.  Surely, the reason \\"Tractors\\" got shortlisted for prestigious prizes is its stealthy power: you think you're reading a tale about a dysfunctional family and Lewycka seems like she's playing it for laughs; then, over the course of 300 pages, the story isn't the funny ha-ha you thought it would be.  Very deftly, Ms. Lewycka has steered you into something quite more profound.
B000GPIPD8|4.0|To tell you the truth, I was a bit dissapointed when I heard the new songs on Myspace. I thought they were ok, but nothing compared to their older work. I was gladly proven wrong when I got the album. Granted, it's no Rubber Factory, but these guys are still rocking on their 4th release and first for Nonesuch Records, Magic Potion.<br /><br />This album does feel like a collection of outtakes from Rubber Factory. The same feel and production is there, like they recorded in an abandoned warehouse. The first song, Just Got to Be, is a great album opener (I heard them play it live in Cincinatti a few months ago), and other tracks such as Your Touch, Give Your Heart Away, and Modern Times are all as consistent as the best work off of Thickfreakness and The Big Come Up.<br /><br />I guess it's the slightly experimental songs on the album that I don't care for. You're The One sounds too much like a lazy Kinks song, and Strange Desire almost has a weird-Pixies thing going on.<br /><br />All complaints aside, though, Magic Potion is a fine record that will still establish their growing fan base, or possibly recruit some new ones as well. If you enjoy Junior Kimbrough, Led Zeppelin, or just rock in general, get this album.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|You can very rarely go wrong with Diana Krall. On this offering you've got her smooth, yet smoky and sulty vocals. You've got her wisely economic piano playing. You've got support from The Clayton / Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. AND, you've got production by Tommy LiPuma, with recording and mixing by Al Schmitt (and Steve Genewick). Every ingredient needed for magic is here and magic is indeed what you get.<br /><br />Not much else needs to be said. Established fans will already know what she's about and I guess all interested parties need know is that if you're looking for a relaxing but inspirational vocal jazz performance, you need look no further. You might also want to check out some of her earlier recordings like \\"All For You\\", \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" or \\"The Look of Love\\" all of which I think are brilliant. My memory is not what it used to be (so I stand to be corrected) but this is the first of Krall's CDs that offers such long and complex solo improvisations - Jeff Clayton on alto sax, Gil Castellanos and Terell Stafford on trumpet, and Rickey Woodard on tenor sax, just to name a few - and this will no doubt satisfy some critics who have accused her of not being a proper jazz vocalist but just a pretty girl with a nice voice who sings standards. Sure, she's no Ella Fitzgerald but there was only ever going to be one of those.<br /><br />She's no Cassandra Wilson either but then she doesn't pretend to be. Personally I think it's refreshing to listen to a singer who knows her limitations but makes the best of what she's working with. What some might find boring or samey samey, I simply see as consistent. But I'm a fan and I'm biased.<br /><br />It's a beautiful set, the only jarring moment coming from \\"From This Moment On\\" which I personally found a bit loud and too cluttered. But one awkward sounding song out of twelve (including the bonus track) is a minor issue. Some strings would've been nice but I guess you can't everything. I'm totally satisfied.
B000002QWD|5.0|I'd rather hear Nat King Cole sing Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire than anyone else.  Still this was a family favorite when I was growing up and although I still own the record (yes, record) I purchased the CD to continue listening to it now.  Bing Crosby is a Christmas staple and this collection of songs is one of his best.
0553260111|4.0|A complex plot that may keep you hooked, but the main combatant Delta/Cain is unbelievebly tough -- he beats up or kills countless bad guys -- almost like superman. He is incredible but too unreal for me. If you want to read about a guy on the run from everyone and is more like a real person, try \\"The Dogs of Riga\\".
B000I186FW|1.0|Clearly, this is not up to DVD quality standards. Movie is 640x480 (not 720x480 widescreen), and only 2 channel, vs 5.1 DD audio. Even more pathetic? The price is identical to the actual DVD. Save the money, and the slow download. Buy the DVD, and archive as needed.
0312979479|5.0|Probably the best book The Dame ever published. The story has been copied thousands of times ever since in movies TV and novels; but this is the blueprint.<br /><br />If you have seen one of the several movie adaptations or the Theater play you still have to read this; you are in for a surprise. The Dame rewrote some parts of it for theater including adding a different ending.<br /><br />Great characterization, a water-tight plot without holes and incredible atmospheric tension makes this one a readers delight; and a perfect entertainment for a rainy day at home.<br /><br />And remember; whatever you do, DO NOT look at the last page.
1401302378|4.0|Chris Anderson is an editor for Wired Magazine.  A couple years back he had (or stumbled upon) a great insight, namely that the internet and digital storage were changing the cost structure normally associated with keeping huge numbers of units in stock for customers and that was changing consumer buying patterns.  That insight led to a Wired article that was apparently the most commented-on in Wired history.  That makes sense; the concept is truly interesting and a number of companies (like Amazon) have based their business model on it.  That said, I think you'd be better served to read Anderson's original article than his book. <br /> <br />In the book, Anderson repeats the same idea many times and gives a lot of examples almost always revolving around music sales.  While Anderson touches on a couple of other ideas like Amazon and Wikipedia, his constant fall-back to the music example begins to make you feel like Anderson either got lazy on research or that there isn't much depth to the long tail concept.   <br /> <br />Whatever the case is, it seems that reading Anderson's original article will save you a lot of time and give you his concept in a more powerful dose.   <br /> <br />This isn't a bad book, but I'll bet it was a much better article.  It's worthy of four stars for the insight Anderson had if for no other reason.
0805076476|5.0|this is the latest of chuck  p's books that i have read...i figured why read the book when i can quote the movie by heart..it took me a really long time to get to this book and when i did i was happy to find some similarities between the book and the movie and then i was even more extatic to find out that the ending of the book is nothing like the ending in the movie...this gave the book the edge that the movie did not have..the book was quite similar to the movie and i found that i did not mind it as much because it has been a while since i had seen the movie, so the fact i could no longer quote the movie, i no longer feared the predictability of the book. the book is an incredible story and many die hard fans of the movie would not be upset with the book and i would have to recomend this book to anyone who has not read it yet. the story in the book is just different enough to keep the well seasoned veteran of the movie entertained enough to plow through the 200 and some odd pages and to end up with a different idea of what fightclub is truly about. the book definitely involves different characters unlike the movie and shows the perspective of someone other than the main characters. with this one can see the true impact of how fightclub has influenced some of the individuals. the spoken word that is read is stronger than the spoken words that are heard and seen.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is my favorite movie, and that is saying a lot considering I have seen over 500 movies.  I remember when it first came out and I saw it in the theater.  An unforgettable experience.  This movie is gripping right from the beginning, mysterious which draws you in, and consistently provides a dramatic and interesting plot.  It is philosophical at times, making it a \\"thinkers\\" movie, but there is also all out action, making it suitable for action movie fans as well.  It really pushes the envelope for special effects and the creation of effective sci-fi concepts.  This DVD is a must have in the collections of movie fans everywhere.

Nor would your business be in peril if you ignored them, as the authors suggest. <br /> <br />In general, these laws are only for those obsessed with being number one.

For everyone else, there are a few small pearls to be gathered, but digging through the muck to find them makes them difficult to spot.

B00003CXWV|4.0|This film is far from perfect but it certainly is a time capsule of the 70's annd 80's growth of cocaine culture in the US and the story of one man who played a key role in it's spread. Johnny Depp is fabulous in the lead role as George Jung and the supporting cast is solid, with the possible exception of Penelope Cruz who is ok but probably the weakest performer in the movie.<br /><br />The story follows the unlikely rise of a middle class kid from the east coast who moves to California in 1968 and begins to make easy money dealing pot. The growing drug culture coincides with his meteroric rise and incredible wealth. Like all morality tales the guy falls just as quickly as he rose and winds up with shattered family relationships and in prison.<br /><br />Well written and plotted, the film moves briskly through 2 decades of George Jung's life without feeling choppy and the story is always intriguing.
B000002HRE|5.0|OK. I'm going to admit it. Reload was the first Metallica album I got. Actually, it was sent to me by my friend in London. After listening to it in my car for a week or so it really grew on me. Low Man's Lyric is probably my favourite Metallica song ever. It strikes deep, tears at the soul. I lost...someone rather dear to me, lost him to heroin. That song was his song, and will forever remind me of him. <br />Because I liked Reload so much, I bought their Black Album, loved it, then proceeded to ...And Justice For All, and Master Of Puppets. Love them all. Now, I went sort of backwards, but that doesn't make me less of a metal fan, less of a Metallica fan. Yeah, I started late, but whatever.  <br />This is a great album. Take it for what it is, not for what it isn't. I had nothing to compare it with, and maybe that's why I like it so much. <br />Dammit but you'll never enjoy anything if you compare it to everything else. Reload is a great music album. Thrash metal or not. <br />Fuel - best song to have blasting in the car <br />The Unforgiven II - just as good as the I one. has a different feel to it, the real first \\"change\\" in this album <br />Slither - just amuses me for no reason... <br />Prince Charming - y'want some thrashing metal? here it is <br />Low Man's Lyric - ...I've already covered this <br />Attitude - like Fuel, is a good song for the car, and like Slither also amuses me for seemingly no reason... <br /> <br />I've not detailed all the songs, obviously. Listen to it yourself, and TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|oh mastodon... were will your music go next? will you ever make an album you can't top? so if you havent already figured it out, to my unsuprise mastodon has once again outdone themselves with there newest album blood mountain. what can i say... for starters the sound is cut throat sharp... more emphasis on the guitars, especially the base.. the colaboration with scott kelly from neurosis, cleaner vocals, yeah, i like the vocals alot. and well, there are some strange things on blood mountain also i guess that i don't quite understand like the screaching industrial noises in some of the later songs. i wonder why they did that? and i was a little dissapointed when the 22 minute song \\"pendulous skin\\" wasn't 22 minutes of music but 5 with some guy at the last minute saying something about myspace.. that was stupid. i have listened to the album 4 times all the way through so far, and i think its hitting me at full force now. when it took me about a dozen listens when i purchased leviathan before i finally \\"got it\\" haha. well mabby not a dozen.. so, buy blood mountain!!! you'll be showing the music industry there are still people out there who want mainstream metal to be good again. in fact, blood mountain is so good it will make your head explode. metal!
0060934719|4.0|Neil Gaiman's \\"Stardust\\" takes place in a mystical version of England.  The town of Wall is a tiny, safe and quiet village that is a bastion of safety from the outside world.  Residents of the aptly-named Wall never venture outside of the village barriers and nobody from outside is allowed in, so as to keep Wall safe.  Villagers, in pairs, are assigned shift duties in protecting the Gap that separates Wall from the outside world.<br /><br />Young Tristran Thorn will do anything to win the high-maintenance heart of village beauty Victoria Forester.  Victoria is not interested in Tristran who she sees as being a simpleton but one day agrees to give her heart to him if he accomplishes one improbable task: to bring back to her the shooting star they both saw fall on one hot summer night.  There's only one major problem: the star fell outside of the barricades of Wall.  Tristran, who stubbornly embarks on this improbable mission, is about to enter a world far more strange and dangerous than he ever thought was possible...<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is indeed a fairytale although one that's written with a target audience of adults, given that it has a somewhat complex (not to mention very British) writing style.  Throughout the first half of the novel I couldn't help but feel somewhat deceived since what had been marketed to me as a \\"dark fairy tale for adults\\" seemed like a typical fantasy story of old villagers in made-believe lands and not much of it was \\"dark\\" at all.  Then midway through the novel Tristran crosses paths with some truly evil characters which more than legitimizes the \\"dark fairy tale\\" classification.<br /><br />The world that Gaiman creates outside of Wall is populated with many freakish sights such as a family of brothers intent on murdering their own kin, a star that once it lands takes the shape of a beautiful woman and a witch who...well, it must be read to be believed.  The world that he creates is simultaneously enchanting and horrifying.  I loved the moral tone of this story, how coming back from his long journey Tristran found himself maturing and that his priorities had changed.  Kind of like a young person who needs to \\"find himself\\" so goes backpacking in a different part of the world and comes back a more rounded individual after the experience.<br /><br />Definitely a must for fans of Gaiman, and a perfect place to start (along with \\"Neverwhere\\" and \\"Coraline\\") for those who have never read him before.  Fans of this enchanting novel will be glad to know that a major movie adaptation starring the likes of Claire Danes, Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Siena Miller and a slew of other big names has just completed filming and will be released in 2007.loved the moral tone of this story, how coming back from his long journey Tristran found himself maturing and that his priorities had changed.

B000002UB3|5.0|'Abbey Road' is actually the last album the Beatles recorded together.  It is a triumph and a fine way to end their time together as history's most celebrated rock band.  They agreed to do two \\"sides\\"--as was conventional before C.D.'s--each one uniform.  Side one is rock and roll unadulterated.  Side two is a pop symphony that is carefully melded together with several segues, making the songs melt into one another.  It is correctly considered one of their great works, but the polish makes it different than their previous work 'The White Album'. <br /> <br />As usual the individual tastes are apparent.  John has some heavy-duty rock songs with an almost caveman sexuality.  \\"Come Together\\" is shivery in pattern with vocals that are processed for a primitive effect.  Purposely, Lennon sings like he just learned English.  It is still intriguing if he relates to \\"old flat-top\\" or if he's mocking him.  Maybe, both.  John gets to end and begin his rock side, so \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" presents sexuality with synthesizers and guitars that bring a mammoth presence to his topic.  In the mix is Paul's fifties' shake shop ballad \\"Oh, Darling!\\" complete with a substantial refrain that gives some heft to the song.  \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" continues Paul's love for fun novelty songs.  This story isn't as clever as \\"Rocky Raccoon,\\" but it's as easily as funny.  He makes his creepy character seem cutely normal.  And, on 'Abbey Road,' this is the beginning of many.  Ringo turns in one of his best moments with his own composition \\"Octopus's Garden\\".  Having sufficient accompaniment, he sings a narration of an underwater paradise that should be considered more than an elaboration of \\"Yellow Submarine\\".  The country-accented music and the fifties' feel refrain make it a substantial contribution.  Then, if George always seemed in the shadow of John and Paul, on 'Abbey Road' he comes up with two songs that not only match, but surpass, his comrades' work.  Frank Sinatra called 'Something' \\"the best love song of the last fifty years.\\"  George caressed the melody and provided enough of his own accompaniment to shoot this great ballad to one of the top six all-time Beatles' bestsellers.   <br /> <br />Side two is not an anti-climax.  Appropriately, George continues his roll with the intricate and beautiful \\"Here Comes the Sun\\".  Eloquent in word and expert in guitar interplay, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" has to be one of the five best Beatles' songs ever.  It's a majestic beginning to a magnificent side.  \\"Because\\" which follows is a soaring piece of music.  Sort of a hippie exhaltation of nature, \\"Because\\" may contain their best harmony performance of any song.  Next, we start off tenderly with Paul's \\"You Never Give Me Your Money,\\" a song that gets funky and faster and laments the financial headaches the Beatles had with their songwriting contracts.  \\"Sun King,\\" which follows seems to add to the langorous grandeur of \\"Because,\\" but from here we get the long stretch.  \\"Sun King\\" melts into \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and provides one of many weirdos.  This one seems unnaturally tight with money.  \\"Polythene Pam\\" provides great bouncey music for someone who can only be considered androgenous .  Then, \\"She Came Through the Bathroom Window\\" is Paul's fanciful take on a wayward woman who seems to take over.  Once the listeners catch their breath, Paul provides a fine lullaby \\"Golden Slumbers,\\" sung passionately enough in the refrain to prevent it from becoming ordinary.  Lastly, \\"Carry That Weight\\" is a chiding admonition for someone.  Maybe it is to say we are all overly burdened.  Then, we get a reprise to \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" and \\"The End\\" which is wild and funky--some compare it to The James' Gang.   <br /> <br />\\"And, in the end/The love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\\"  Always remaining irreverent until \\"The End,\\" the Beatles hang together musically for what has to be the bottom line of their music.  It is hard to imagine that they didn'tknow that 'Abbey Road' would be their last recording together.  If they didn't, they sure found the best way to send us off.  Perhaps it may seem extraneous, but if we didn't know they weren't being serious, Paul adds \\"Her Majesty,\\" a playful piece of nonsense as an afterthought.   <br /> <br />(Both sides end abruptly, just to let us know not to take them too seriously.  For Beatle hounds, their last magnum opus provided the groups' greatest rumor.  Paul was dead.  He was gone for three years and mysteriously replaced by a double who sprouted a moustache for a disguise, but still retained a voice that matched his deceased predecessor, even though he was able to add some new depth to the group's lyrics.  It was the best kept secret in show business, but The Beatles wanted to be discreet, yet fair to their audience.   So they sprinkled clues on every album starting with 'Sgt. Pepper' in case their secret was discovered.  They could then save face with an explanation that they always meant to tell us, and they always provided a treasure hunt of clues to help their fans find out the truth.  Malcolm Smith (bka Paul McCartney) is living well somewhere in England and recently published 'Chaos and Creation in the Backyard' under his assumed name...)
B000852GIQ|5.0|This is the best album I have ever bought - period. If you enjoyed the Amelie soundtrack, you will enjoy this album even more. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoy listening to this album. This is a album worth every music collector's collection.
B000001F3C|5.0|U2 started a string of masterpieces with 'War' their first brilliant album from their early years.  While 'Boy' and 'October' are excellent and reinvented the wheel of pop music, 'War' is more accomplished and varied musically and is conceptually sound.  The raw power of their early years is harnessed on this album as well as an expertise the two predecesors lacked.  There are really two sides to the album:  One could be called \\"War;\\" the other could be called \\"Love,\\" but they are both intertwined throughout.      Passion is U2's hallmark, and they certainly jump-start the album well enough with their celtic-laced political anthem \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\".  Consisting of basically a mixed band of Irish Catholic and Protestant band members, Bono, their talking head, sings such scathing lines as \\"We eat and drink while tomorrow they die,\\" and \\"...to blame the victory Jesus won...on you.\\"  \\"Seconds,\\" continues the flow with a folk-rock beginning that melts into haunting images accompanied by ethereal sounds.  Containing the admonition that \\"They're doing the atomic bomb/Hoping you will join along,\\" Bono and The Edge end singing,...\\"Say, goodbye; say, goodbye; say, goodbye!\\"    Then, if the drama and tension weren't enough, they play \\"New Year's Day,\\" a brilliant and mesmerizing song with shimmering piano and the pulsating electric current of Edge's guitar.  It is a beautiful and haunting rock song done in the first person for Poland's then-exiled solidarity members.  Following is \\"Like a Song...\\" one of the best on the album.  With great thrusts of fast-forward power, Bono sings a stinging lament for the older Irish generation who don't leave hope for the younger.  At the end of the \\"War\\" side, \\"Drowning Man\\" is the first of their brilliant portraits of someone torn by the horrors of war.  The harrowing dimension of a refugee is expertly captured by the music and words.  They cover most of the major conflicts well on half a C.D. Then, the second half starts with a make love not war notion by saying the Irish Civil War is making beautiful women defect to America.  At this point, Bono couldn't sing \\"America\\" with enough scathing force.  \\"Two Hearts Beat as One\\" demonstrates that \\"Refugee\\" is just a transitional song, but the spare lyrics and the cyclical pattern of The Edge's guitar (which give one the sound image of the early flying machines before the Wright Brothers triumphed) a fine thrust of music.  It is pretty bottom line about love.  \\"Red Light\\" addresses unrequited love with a jazzy accompaniment that gives the album a scope previous efforts lacked.  \\"Surrender\\" is beautiful, and \\"'40,'\\" based on Psalm 40, is a celestial send-off that foreshadows the advent of their next work, 'The Unforgettable Fire'.    'War' is a brilliant beginning masterpiece for U2.  It is characteristic of what experience would bring for them in a string of albums up to and including 'Achtung Baby,' in '91.  It is a ten year stretch that changed the face of music, even while providing passion for often disturbing material.
B000EGCITG|4.0|Wanna talk puzzling single choices?  I used to say -- and only half-jokingly -- that if I could just run everything for a week, I could get so much needlessly goofy crap corrected that it would be the most momentous seven days since Genesis.  But things now seem so royally screwed up that I'm pretty sure I'll need at least two to make a real dent.  A perfect case in point:  my darling Pink.  In April, she released her fourth studio album -- a great set of songs produced and mostly co-written by the miraculous Billy Mann called I'm Not Dead (a sly reference to the fact that her previous album Try This was an Ishtar-size megaflop) -- preceded by a boatload of buzz, courtesy of the attention-hogging video for the set's first single, \\"Stupid Girls,\\" which had Pink crucifying Paris Hilton, that ghastly tramp-ola Jessica Simpson (are there words for how terrifying she has become?!), and other brainless tarts who have stumbled into unaccountable fame.  The song itself was neither bland nor brilliant (nor did it matter); the videoclip, however, was a big ol' slab of trashy fun that put her firmly back in the spotlight (and even won her a spot on \\"Oprah\\" to help dissect the plight of teenage girls in contemporary America, for cripes' sake!).  And how did LaFace Records pay this left-field forward?  They decided to push to radio the overheated \\"Who Knew\\" -- which was an instant stiff -- instead of that pulsing firecracker \\"U + Ur Hand,\\" a finger-flipping stunner written by Max Martin and his cabal (whose \\"Since U Been Gone\\" blasted Kelly Clarkson into the ionosphere two years ago), in which Pink not-so-gently informs some won't-take-no dude precisely with whom he'll be going home at night's end (hint -- that would be words three and four in the song's title).  Say it with me, now:  are they freakin' mad?!  You distract `em with a strong video, and then you flatten `em with a surprise left hook -- isn't that A&R 101?  Didn't Christina Aguilera play that hand to breathtaking perfection a few years back with \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Beautiful\\"?  To be sure, the coarse language in \\"Hand\\" would have given the standards and practices office fits -- the seething contempt with which Pink imbues the phrase \\"cock fight\\" alone is scorching -- but considering what top forty radio will most certainly be letting Justin Timberlake -- more on him directly -- get clean away with this fall, that seems like a molehill.  I'd call this the year's most egregious mistake, but the Dixie Chicks plopped their stubborn Texan butts on that title months ago and have thus far refused to budge.rfection a few years back with \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Beautiful\\"?

I approached the novel with skepticism, though I had been assured by trusted sources that it was wonderful. <br /> <br />This novel really is everything it's touted to be -- beautifully written with passages so descriptive you feel like you're there -- shrouded in a mystery that at times is as fantastical as a scene from _Alice in Wonderland_ -- a truly engrossing novel that reminded me yet again of how much pleasure and delight can result from reading a truly fine book. <br /> <br />Ms. Setterfield's debut does not read like a first novel at all; she spins her glimmering web of a story with a gentle grace that will be remembered for years to come.
B00005JLIU|1.0|I saw this movie more than once during its theatrical release in the 1960s, and enjoyed it very much. However, for some reason, when I bought the new DVD and saw it again, I found it to be so tedious and embarassingly corny that I turned it off after the first half-hour and donated the disk to my library. The acting is all annoyingly over-the-top, and James Fox, in particular, is so hyperactive I wanted to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart. Maybe it was the difference between viewing as a kid and as an adult, but this film has really lost its luster.
B000021XS0|5.0|If you are over 50 like me and yearn to hear something that thrills you like Yes used to do and amazes you like Genesis used to do then I recommend that you spring a few bucks for this album and prepare to be amazed.  I thought progressive rock was dead and gone but my son turned me on to these guys and I'm very happy that he did.  The production and sound quality is fantastic throughout and the musicianship is phenomenal.  Yes, it's quite intense at times but so was \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" on Fragile and \\"Supper's Ready\\" on Foxtrot.  And I was so pleased to hear music that took me more than one listen to \\"get\\" that I now plan to invest in more offerings from this group to see what else I've been missing.  Don't let these artists fly under your radar any longer.
B000G759LW|5.0|I can't follow all those people who feel so dissapointet about her new cd... <br />its pretty good, just different from what she've done before, which dosent make it less good at all. <br />she tried to mix something old with elements of todays music, wich ended up in a doubble cd. One with music mixed by a dj with a sound of classical elements, and the second only made by classical music, choir and Christinas voice. <br />It sounds great and all of the songs are good,not only two...In my opinion Ain't no other man shouldn't have been the first single. most of the songs are much better.. i can only say that i love the cd, and  would recommend it to everyone who likes Christina's voice. <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This album may be a lot of things but boring isn't one of them.  While I'm not crazy about the opening tune (despite the poignant and hard-hitting lyrics) the following seven songs are exemplary and moving.  Some may not like \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" but I don't have a problem with these composers expressing some deeper emotions from time to time and the latter song is one of the better tunes I've heard from anyone in many moons.  \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is an awesome statement about the inhumanity of terrorism and fanaticism that drives to the very core of the matter without apology.  And the opus of \\"Octavarium\\" is stunning in its scope and ambition.  These guys are continuing to push the envelope of their creativity and the result is exciting and fearless.  I, for one, hope to hear more experiments with orchestration in their coming albums.  For now I'm content with what I paid for in this collection and highly recommend this band to all fans of progressive rock.
B000002HMH|5.0|I think, while I sit eating a chimichanga and some vegetable soup, that there are a lot of people who have severely limited themselves, and themselves alone, with their defiance to this album. <br /> <br />I always thought it ridiculous that people took it as a strike against them personally that Metallica would go in any other direction. The only crime I find these men have comitted with regards to their direction (and this goes for ANYONE who wishes to assert ANY individuality at all) was trying to justify it. <br /> <br />\\"Metallica sold out!\\" <br />\\"How do you figure?\\" <br />\\"They cut their hair and went soft!\\" <br />\\"Number one: given; number two: HOW DO YOU FIGURE!\\" <br /> <br />I would like to say to anyone out there willing to listen (or read), I suggest you try the album again. Because if you honestly think tunes like \\"Outlaw Torn\\" or \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" aren't among this band's heaviest efforts, you need to give your head a shake.  <br /> <br />It is almost painful to admit, but I must (shudder) agree with Lars Ulrich. He was the first to tell people to pack it if they don't appreciate Metallica's music. It's among your inalienable rights, if you don't like it, don't listen to it. Goes the same for them: if they like it, they'll record it. If you don't like it, don't buy it. I think it is important to clear up this little misconception about Metallica \\"Selling out to their fans\\". They didn't right the album for any of you, or me; neither did they do so on any other recording before or after. Actually, dare I say it (I do), the older stuff was by far less against the grain (to the effect that \\"the grain\\" exists) than their newer stuff is. <br /> <br />All these statements apply to their efforts after Load as well. They wrote what they wanted and continue to do so. Next time they role through your town, and you want to tell 'em what's what. Better get a ticket quick (sale lasts about an hour) and scream louder than the sold out audience is. <br /> <br />Load got me into Metallica. I can say that, and bite me if you don't like it. Ever since that point, I stopped listening to whatever everyone else is listening to. <br /> <br />Oh, update for anyone who needs it: Rick Rubin is producing album no. 10. So be prepared to have a fire lit up under you. <br /> <br />Catch y'all on the flip side.
B00000DQSS|5.0|The first REAL Kate Bush album (actually the third, the first two were great also)the one where she finally came closer to her vision of what her music should sound like and it's brilliant, original, experimental and fun!

B000H305U0|4.0|...but JT's sophomore effort is da bomb. I've never been a Justin Timberlake fan in the past, so when I found myself dancing to the infectious beat of Sexyback, I couldn't believe it. With Nelly Furtado's Loose, FutureSex/LoveSounds is by far the best pop record of the year. What's that? Timbaland produced both albums? Well, what do you know. I guess this makes Timbo a genius, because let's face it; even though Nelly and JT are both talented people, without Timbaland's Midas touch, things probably would have been a lot different. The way he helps artists reinvent themselves is astonishing, and JT's latest effort is there to prove it. Justin has never sounded sexier, and the way his falsetto complements Timbaland's killer beats is brilliant. A mixture of electronica, hip-hop, pop and R&B, FS/LS has something for everyone. From the Prince-inspired Damn Girl to the incredible LoveStoned/I Think She Knows, almost every song has smash hit written all over it. While I used to find JT's arrogance tiresome and annoying, his sex-appeal is undeniable on this album; he's hot, and he knows it. And you know what? It's kind of refreshing. I prefer a singer who's aware of his sexiness and doesn't mind using it to all those mopey crooners who keep polluting the airwaves with there sappy love songs (ie.: James Blunt). He's got an ego the size of Texas, but at least he's got the talent to back it up, unlike many other so-called pop artists (*cough* Paris Hilton *cough*). A lot of critics have called Justin the new King of Pop. Though this may be a heavy crown to wear, I think it will fit beautifully on JT's pretty little head.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Frank Sinatra, as you might expect, gives a flawless performance recorded here at The Sands Hotel in Las Vegas in early 1966. He is ably backed up by none other than the great Count Basie and his band. The effect on the audience is unmistakable: they love the chairman, they love Basie's music; and they can't get enough and cry out for more when the act is drawing to a close.<br /><br />But while the act is on and Sinatra is performing it is magic every moment. Sinatra starts out on an upbeat note with \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and then goes into the more relaxed and romantic \\"I've Got A Crush On You.\\" In fact, Sinatra goes on to sing nearly 20 songs here on this 74 minute CD; Sinatra also clearly enjoys his banter back and forth with his audience. He jokes with them and regales them with funny stories about how he got his start in show business. Frank claims that the story that he has just turned 50 is \\"a dirty Communist lie\\" and he goes on to assert that \\"(his) body may be 50 but (he's) 28!!!\\" Sinatra, always the penultimate performer, honors Basie and Quincy Jones with high praise for some terrific musical arrangements throughout the show. You'll wish you had been there!<br /><br />Other great songs include the romantic \\"Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words);\\" the sentimental \\"The September Of My Years;\\" a \\"new song\\" called \\"The Shadow Of Your Smile;\\" and the triumphant and joyous \\"My Kind Of Town.\\" What a great diversity of song styles here!<br /><br />The quality of the sound is excellent and the CD insert includes the original liner notes from the record album written by Stan Cornyn in 1966. There are also great black and white photographs of Sinatra, Count Basie and his band and the color photo on the cover of the CD insert is perfect.<br /><br />Although you'll be disappointed when this CD comes to an end the good news is that you can play it over and over again--just as I did! It brings back memories from my childhood of traveling with my parents to luxury hotels where everybody dressed for dinner, huge Cadillacs with fins and loud rumbling engines drove up to the hotel to be parked by the valet and large crowds filled huge ballrooms to see the big stars of the day perform live. If you were lucky you just might catch a glimpse of Yul Brynner or Judy Garland in the front row of the theater. Those were some days!<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD for Sinatra fans (obviously), fans of classic pop vocals and fans of Count Basie and his band. I hope you enjoy every moment of this experience as much as I did!

B000065V9Y|3.0|I've changed my opinion on this and give it a 5 star rating.  It has helped me deal with my mother's very recent death and I'm hearing it differently.  It's a very spiritual effort, bordering on religion, but more like the pagan religions of northern Europe and of Sinead O'Connor, who's voice adds much to the celtic-inspired songs.      Some anger and overdone rock here add nice contrast to the ethereal celtic pieces, but mostly, this is a resolved, sweet processional with a monasterial presence and naturalness to it.    If you like \\"Red Rain,\\" this cd has three songs you may just love.  \\"Come Talk to Me\\" summons all of the incantations of celtic dance, replete with bagpipes and Peter's own brand of techno-static.  \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" is a hard-edged rocker, with a Keith Richards-inspired rhythm guitar section that will melt in your mouth.  \\"Secret World\\" also takes you into that wonderful world of celtic rhythms, where images of Scottish dance with swirling dervish kilts making full-circle flourishes.  \\"Only Us\\" is good, as it fits in with the misty, meditative, often Irish, mood of the whole.  Irregular time signatures on some of the songs are held in check to give the feel of riding a little fast over speed bumps in a vehicle with good suspension.  This is the Anglo-Saxon energy kicking in, distinguishing the work from the too placid and polished elements in Irish music.  The blend of the two styles is just about right here.    On \\"Secret World,\\" Gabriel effectively uses some of the psychedelic sitar sound the Beatles used on \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Revolver,\\"  and you get to revisit \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (\\"Revolver\\") in a compelling new context - certainly not as original, but a lot more reassuring.  The time signature is less irregular and not as jarring as \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\"  Both are appropriate for their respective songs because \\"Secret World\\" is post-mordem medicine for the survivors, whereas \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" has the intensity and franticelements of the dying phase, where the sounds and visions are not pretty and the final letting go has to be very difficult and challenging.  Only someone like John Lennon dare take it on, and he did so flawlessly on that song.  The only way for it to end is at the beginning.

B000F7CMQ8|2.0|Mogambo is an inferior re-make of the 1932 film Red Dust starring Clark Gable in the role he reprised here. Taking Mary Astor's place as the wife of an anthropologist (Donald Sinden) is Grace Kelly and replacing sexy Jean Harlow as a loose visitor is Ava Gardner. The film is set in the wild of Africa where animals roam free. Gable is a trapper who craves danger and shuns too much civility. However, he is transformed by the beautiful visitor despite the fact that she has a husband, and she becomes smitten with him. Feeling used and disposed of, Gardner wisecracks constantly about the chemistry between the two, and is hurt by their relationship.<br /><br />This film is much longer than the original version and there is absolutely no chemistry between the cast. Kelly seems wooden and bored with the part and walks through it with a stuffy grace that is hard to be endeared to. Gardner tries hard, but she's more annoying than fun. She also has a hard face which makes her less attractive than the part calls for; her personality does not make up for this. Gable is the best, but even he lacks energy. He hardly emotes anything and his few bursts of feeling seem forced.<br /><br />Even the scenery cannot save the film. It is a chore to sit through.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|I give this album 4 stars because only a perfect album should get 5, but thats not to say that there's anything dissapointing about A Matter Of Life And Death. This is exactly what you want in a new Iron Maiden album. It's got that vintage Maiden feel and sound, but its not dated. It doesn't feel like it should have come out 15 years ago. They've managed to make an album that works today and feels \\"new\\" but without sacrificing anything you'd want hear from Maiden. The events of recent history are not talked about specifically but you know what they're referring to. They're angry again, and angry Maiden is great Maiden. At the same time, you can feel that they are still enjoying doing what they do. The hook in The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg will stay with you. Other highlights to check out are Different World, These Colours Don't Run, and The Longest Day. Over all, this album rocks!

B000FGGE68|5.0|This Movie Is Great.  You gotta see it.  There is so much great stuff in it.  There is Dimensional Compression, a Motorcycle, a Sweet Babe, and a bunch of cool weapons.  There is also a ton of fake explosions and fake smoke.  The best part of this movie is the amazing weapon combination of the Mac 10 and the Katana.  A SWORD GUN.  This has enspired me to create a number of other well known weapon combos.  The Nunchaku Sniper Rifle, the Chansaw LazerGun, and my personal best favorite weapon of choice, the Shotgun Maul.   YOU should see this movie.  No Question.
B000GTLQXU|2.0|To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old movies and make them at least as good or better. Poseidon accomplishes neither.<br /><br />The Poseidon Adventure (1972) was a better movie than Poseidon. It had better actors. And sadly the special effects were just as good in the original from over 30 years ago. Shameful.<br /><br />Here are some examples of random silliness without the movie trying to be silly:<br /><br />-Lots of fires but absolutely no smoke.<br />-Civilians are smart enough to try to find a way out of impending doom but none of the ship's officers agree.<br />-A guy blindly dives from a ledge into a flooded room assuming that it's deep enough and there will be nothing in the water to impale him.<br />-Several rafts conveniently waiting upon escape from the ship into the water.<br />-Immediately after escape the ship sinks...nick of time escape is goofy.<br />-Rescue calvary consists of 2 commuter-type helicopters...not the coast guard.<br /><br />Oh and there's plenty more silliness. Don't buy this. Don't rent it. Wait for cable at best.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|OK, let's be frank. The plot of this Aeon Flux movie would barely be enough for a 1960's Sci-Fi short story. Think Van Vogt revisited, 21st century style. Think video games, fast moving action, spectacular but harmless kicks, slow motion bullets. Now, to be fair, eventhough the whole package was wrapped into a better pseudo-clever scheme, Matrix plot's wasn't much newer or deeper... So why the \\"decent, if mindless, entertainment\\" rating? Well, if you are reading this, I guess you know the answer: Charlize Theron is stunningly beautiful and that movie is build around her body dynamics. You are just looking for a reason to watch her. Indulge yourself!<br /><br />PS: Marton Csokas is probably the only real actor on the set. But he lacks Charlize's sex appeal. At least from a male point of view.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|Man, I remember seeing Rainbow circa 1977 at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, NJ. I refer fondly to that period of time in my life as \\"My Dark Years\\", but due to certain circumstances my memories of that time are...well..a bit dark. So what a delight it was to see the release of Rainbow Live in Munich to be able to experience the show on DVD with a clear head. The problem is that the awesome performances on this disk are footage from 1977, so the video quality is 1977 video...and that ain't too good.<br /><br />Often times there are real reminders that the video is dated because of horizontal lines across the picture and just plain old low quality video. The experience is reduced to a mere DVD viewing after enjoying what was more of a front row seat experience with the quality HD video on some recent releases {i.e. Judas Priest (Rising in the East), Iron Maiden (Rock in Rio), Dio (Holy Diver Live) and even Rock the Nation by Kiss}.<br /><br />The audio on Live in Munich is a completely different story. The audio wizards took the soundtrack to the show on this disk, cleaned it up and they've offered it with a terrific 5.1 Dolby or DTS mix. I thought the DTS repro sounded the best on my system.<br /><br />Regardless of the horrible video, it was great to reminisce and watch as singer Ronnie James Dio, legend Ritchie Blackmore, inspirational Heavy Metal drummer Cozy Powell, Bob Daisley (Bass) and David Stone (Keys) went through some of the classics from Rainbow's first three releases.<br /><br />What's really sad is that Rainbow could have done this concert with a lot more than 8 songs. Ritchie Blackmore's infatuation with himself prevented that. In almost every song except the first, Blackmore self-indulges in out-of-place guitar solos that are difficult to sit through. I'm not talking about the bridge guitar solos that are on the studio releases; I'm talking about random intros or interruptions in each song to deliver a monotonous, rambling, wee-da-la-wee-da-la of the six-string. Instead of the guitar monotony, great tunes that fans really wanted to hear (like Tarot Woman, Stargazer, etc) could have been included. Just look at the guitar-solo-excessive times on these songs....They give you:<br /><br />1) Kill the King 4:42<br />2) Mistreated 11:49<br />3) Sixteenth Century Greensleeves 8:52<br />4) Catch the Rainbow 18:14<br />5) Long Live Rock and Roll 8:04<br />6) Man on the Silver Mountain 16:25<br />7) Still I'm Sad 27:33<br />8) Do You Close Your Eyes 15:40<br />Plus a Bonus disk with videos of LLRR, Gates of Babylon and LA Connection.<br /><br />But all in all, if you were a Dio-years Rainbow fan don't pass on this. Just be sure that your expectations are set for a view into the past with the past's video quality. The performances are 4 stars, the reproduced sound is 4 stars and the video quality is 1 star.uitar monotony, great tunes that fans really wanted to hear (like Tarot Woman, Stargazer, etc) could have been included.

B000001ELR|5.0|After the disappointment of 1981's The Elder, Kiss entered the  Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin work on 1982's Creatures Of The Night album with a more harder-edge sound than any other album they recorded before. The out-come, was a album that just blows out your ear drums from start to finish. The sound they got on this album is just monstrous, a sound they would try to reproduce on later albums but never quite got. Although the album really didn't do well chart wise, it did have a semi stellar hit with Simmons's I Love It Loud. Besides that song, this album also has such stand out tracks as War Machine, I Still Love You, Rock N' Roll Hell & the title track. The Remastered version of this album just brings out the huge sound this album originally had even more in the instruments. I've always said that if I was in a band making records, this is the type of sound I would want. In retrospect, if you don't already own this, you don't know what you're missing folks cos' this album not only rocks, it also has one of the coolest album covers in history. With that being said, you can't go wrong with this one.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon5's debut album Songs About Jane is still a major sucess despite being close to three years old. The songs include: <br /> <br />Harder to Breathe: Very upbeat song, one of my favorite, more rock and roll feel to it that the others. only track that has profanity (an f-bomb in the intro) <br /> <br />This Love: The first single and the song that introduced me to this wonderful CD and the band behind it. <br /> <br />Shiver: Short song, kinda risque but has a good beat <br /> <br />She Will Be Loved: What i consider to be kind of a \\"chick song\\", still good but not really my type of track. <br /> <br />Tangled: Another great song with a good beat and lyrics another more edgy R&R song <br /> <br />The Sun: Follows more on the R&B vibe and a little bit of spoken word mixed with a simple beat <br /> <br />Must Get Out: Another uplifting kinda song that kinda grabs more soulfully than by the ear. <br /> <br />Sunday Morning: Another one of my favorites and the single released after \\"This Love\\".  <br /> <br />Secret: Follows the suit of \\"The Sun\\" with the R&B, but alot more smooth and slow jam-y. <br /> <br />Through with You: Probably the track they rocked out on the most. My faavorite on the album. dubbed a great break-up song. <br /> <br />Not Coming Home: one of my least favorites on the album. <br /> <br />Swetest Goodbye: another chick song but i actually like this one alot. another inspirational track. <br /> <br />All around i give this CD an A. Look out for their next CD thhat comes out later this Fall!!!
B000H5U65C|5.0|It's true that less can sometimes be more in the world of metal, but Mastodon have clearly never even considered it. Fortunately, though, this Atlanta-based quartet have proven that they're more than capable of using the \\"more is more\\" theory wisely, and getting great results from it. Their enormous and expansive new album, \\"Blood Mountain,\\" is yet another addition to the group's increasingly epic catalogue.<br /><br />This is Mastodon's first release on a major label (they left Relapse to sign to Warner Music earlier in the year), so many immediately assumed it will sound overly polished and more melodic than the band's previous works. Both of those assumptions prove to be true to some extent, because the new disc isn't as raw or sonically heavy as, say, 2002's \\"Remission.\\" But when the results are as good as \\"Blood Mountain,\\" they're hard to argue with. This is a perfectly natural and creative progression from their two year-old masterpiece \\"Leviathan.\\" The newfound progressive metal touches don't dilute or restrain the album's heaviness, and they actually help to emphasize the heavy parts and make them even more intense.<br /><br />Like \\"Leviathan,\\" 2004's whale of an album which was based on Herman Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\" novel, \\"Blood Mountain\\" is also conceptual. It tells a tale about a character climbing a mountain and becoming stranded, and different things happen (the character hallucinates, runs into strange creatures, begins to starve and freeze, etc.) Couple this wondrously imaginative storytelling with such complex, experimental music, and the end result may very well be an album that's the new summit of Mastodon's career.<br /><br />Most of the songs are greatly unpredictable, but there are a couple hypnotic moments. \\"Sleeping Giant\\" and the album closer, \\"Pendulous Skin\\" (which begins with pretty acoustic guitar strums) are two gorgeous, brooding tracks with subdued drum beats, dreary vocals, and other ominously ambient sounds (i.e. guitar feedback).<br /><br />The rest of the disc, however, is a different story. Drummer Brann Dailor really gets to show off his talents on the album opener, \\"The Wolf Is Loose,\\" because he begins the song with a fast, bouncy, all-over-the-place drum pattern that makes the listener wonder how many arms the guy really has. The rest of this song is a crushing, bludgeoning avalanche of distorted guitar leads. The next track, \\"Crystal Skull,\\" continues in this same vein, with a heavy, bullying rhythm; but this song stands out from the one before it because it also features a mazey, spiraling guitar solo, and a cameo by Neurosis' Scott Kelly.<br /><br />\\"Capillarian Crest\\" is quite awesome. With occasional riffs, somewhat melodic guitar leads, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink drumming, and a strong, grumbling bass line, the listener is unsure where to focus his or her attention. Later, \\"Circle Of Cysquatch\\" and \\"Hunters Of The Sky\\" boast catchy, crunching rhythms that cascade like falling logs. \\"Bladecatcher\\" is also of note because it's a total head trip due to its rapid tempo changes, a careening guitar lead, and wild, almost schizophrenic vocals. Following that, \\"Colony Of Birchmen\\" is highlighted by some very melodic singing (by Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme), and a wailing solo. Next, the propulsive ninth track, \\"Hand Of Stone,\\" is fueled by a fiery, blistering flood of riffs. Lastly, \\"This Mortal Soil\\" and \\"Siberian Divide\\" (featuring The Mars Volta's singer, Cedric Bixler-Zavala, and the same band's keyboardist, Isaiah Owens) are both vaguely reminiscent of \\"Leviathan.\\" These songs have a restrained, slow beginning with the drums and guitars playing different time signatures, but then a whiplash tempo change kicks in and the song launches into a deep, intense, corrosive groove with thrashy, surging riffs.<br /><br />The thought of Mastodon having such a creative idea for their third full-length is pretty amazing in itself. But the fact that the band was able pull it off so excellently is downright staggering. The band set their sights even higher than last time, and as a result, Mastodon are not only officially among metal's best active bands, but they have made a record which probably sets a new standard for the rest of their career and almost all music released in 2006. The words \\"great\\" and \\"masterpiece\\" were made for an album like \\"Blood Mountain.\\"and set their sights even higher than last time, and as a result, Mastodon are not only officially among metal's best active bands, but they have made a record which probably sets a new standard for the rest of their career and almost all music released in 2006.

B00003CXAE|4.0|Though a bit uneven at times, this movie still packs plenty of entertainment. The songs are excellent and very memorable. With some musicals, the songs aren't very appealing when heard outside the context of the musical itself because they are theatrical by nature or they rely on the stage action for comprehension. (See \\"West Side Story\\" or \\"Miss Saigon\\") For the most part, this is not the case with \\"Grease,\\" whose songs are perfectly capable of standing alone. This is also helped by the fact some songs from the stage version were dropped from the movie and additional songs were written for the movie. We all know the story by now: greaser Danny and squeaky clean Sandy meet and fall in love over the summer, then say goodbye. Both are surprised to see one another at school in the fall and try to change in order to fit the image of the other's ideal. Aside from the fantastic songs, the film is elevated by some very good, enthusiastic performances by John Travolta, the gorgeous Olivia Newton-John and Didi Conn, among others. The stage musical's youthful exuberance carries over to the film as well, even though some of the actors appear a trifle too old to play high school students. (See Michael Tucci and Stockard Channing for two examples)  This is essentially a musical for folks who don't normally like musicals. Some language and sexual references keep this film from being appropriate for children.
B000HA4WT8|3.0|The real surprise of the third `The Fast and the Furious' film is its cameo appearance. I know I should not write who appears. Just wait for the ending. <br /> <br />Until then, you have to foloow the film's silliest story patiently. In order to avoid a jail sentence, a disgraced son Sean (Lukas Black) is sent to Tokyo where his father lives. In spite of his strict father's advice, Sean gets hooked up with the yakuza (Japanese mafia) there after a car race. Now every Japanese viewer would find the story not only incredible but laughable, for no yakuza, which is tightly organized group, would ever hire an American high school kid as debt collector (it is illegal and too conspicuous)  <br /> <br />But that is not the point, I know, and this film is not made as documentary film. The real selling points of `The Fast and the Furious; Tokyo Drift' is the glittering vista of neon-lit city of Tokyo, and `drifting' or unique style of driving, deliberately skidding your car when turning around a corner. The car stunts are mostly thrilling (mostly meaning when not using special effects), showing the great skills of the stunt drivers.  <br /> <br />My three stars all go to these professionals, not the actors. The film doesn't need to be a Shakespeare, but still some of the players here show atrocious acting that is simply unacceptable. The boys are handsome but cannot move a single muscle of their face, and the ladies are beautiful but they all look so wooden. <br /> <br />(By the way, some Japanese audiences hated the film because of its casting. Except for Sonny JJ Chiba, most of the main `Japanese' characters are played by Asian-American actors, not Japanese actors. Probably Non-Japanese viewers would not mind it, but Taiwanese-born director Justine Lin should have known that we (I mean, Asians) are sometimes very sensitive to the issue.) <br /> <br />All in all, it is a mindless OK film just like two other `Fast and the Furious' films. <br /> <br />If you like this film anddrift racing, try `Initial D.'
B000GGSM94|5.0|Oh man, this album is amazing.  Last time I listened to it was probably a few years ago on the original CD w/o \\"Hey You!\\"  It's awesome to have this masterpiece album remastered with much better sound in its originally intended form of all 18 tracks (Amazon has omitted \\"Torture\\" by mistake, but let me reassure you, it's there in all its edgy glory).  The build-up intro of \\"The Kiss\\" is unparalleled except for say, other Cure songs like \\"Open\\" or \\"Want.\\"  When the first vocals of the album burst upon you (OH KISS ME KISS ME KISS ME!!!  YOUR TONGUE'S LIKE POISON, SO SWOLLEN IT FILLS UP MY MOUTH!!!) you know you're in for a sick ride.  You've got your classic singles \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\" and \\"Hot Hot Hot!!!\\" along with the most famous of all, \\"Just Like Heaven.\\"  But this is only the icing on the cake.  \\"How Beautiful You Are...\\" and \\"One More Time\\" are both amazing non-single tracks, to compliment the rest of the album.  Also, if I were to ever have the opportunity to make a movie, I'd definitely have \\"Fight\\" as the soundtrack to a sick, crazy, violent fight scene...it'd be perfect.  I won't go into all the other tracks...just buy it and experience one of the best albums ever created.  It's so diverse, from crazy-cuckoo happy to dark, angsty, edgy, and anthemic.  Throughout it all, there's always great melody and passion.  Robert Smith is a genius and this release is one of The Cure's strongest...it showcases extreme talent and versatility.<br /><br />PS ~ The bonus disc is awesome for hearing a lot of the songs as they were first presented and comparing them to their end results that made it onto the album...a very nice insight.

B000G75AE8|4.0|Do Slayer have everything to prove or nothing to prove? At this stage in their career it's difficult to tell. Their live shows are still impressively brutal, their last album was certainly one of their heaviest, if not one of their best. And it's true that pretty much everything they released in their first ten years is absolutely seminal stuff. But that said, isn't it about time they released something really memorable again? <br /> <br />On my first listen, I was a little disappointed. It sounded flat and unremarkable, aggressive enough but not compelling. Then something happened.... I turned it up. A lot. Soon enough I was air guitaring and headbanging like a goon - 'Christ Illusion' is an absolute stormer of an album. They seem to have eschewed all notions of catchiness and all reliance on mid-paced 'Diabolus...' stompers, and have created a work of breakneck speed and aggression. It really is quite vicious. <br /> <br />Dave Lombardo has only got better and faster over time, and it's his powerful hands and feet that propel each song through their many rhythms and tempo switches, and their so-fast-you-won't-even-notice fills and breakdowns. Some reviewers have touched upon this album's \\"lack\\" of good riffs, but I think they're missing the point. 'Christ Illusion' seems to be an exercise in power and speed over heavy metal 'riff classicism', and it's not like there's no awesome riffs at all. The opening one on 'Black Serenade' is killer, and elsewhere they seem to have saved the rest for the very well placed mid-tempo breakdowns. Check out the middle section on 'Jihad' for proof. That song in particular is a highlight - a one-note chugfest main riff being propelled by Lombardo's punky kinetic-energy infused drums. In fact, there's more than a whiff of punk on here. I remember a section in 'Consfearacy' that's pure punkiness - and Slayer really nail the vibe, too. It slips perfectly back into thrash metal without seeming out of place, in fact provoking raised eyebrows of approval. <br /> <br />There are some riffs that are a bit Slipknot-esque (in the best way possible, as I happen to think 'Vol. 3' was a superb example of a supposed metal band actually DOING metal finally), and I have to say that these ones really are stompers. <br /> <br />This is 21st Century Slayer, and they're going to kick the crap out of you, because this album is their heaviest and most brutal yet. No, it's not as good as 'Reign In Blood', but who actually cares anymore? How long can you expect a band to deliver something better than genre-defining? Twenty years? Please! <br /> <br />'Christ Illusion' is f**king brutal - end of story.
B00005JNX0|5.0|The best DVD thing about MADAGASCAR besides the hip and funny zoo guys going  wild, the witty story, great character design, ultra-sharp wonderfully hued transfer and the cool commentary by the scene-stealing penguins is the absolutely brilliant voice work by Sacha Baron Cohen. Too bad he's not featured on the extras.<br /><br />If you missed this one and are looking for a riotous family film, all ages will laugh out loud and won't mind seeing it more than once.  The bar is raised very high.  Check it out.
B000I2IT44|5.0|It's a pleasure to watch & listen to this concert & bonus stuff, each time I play it. Considering it's PT's 1st official DVD release, I'm sure they'll continue to put out some really good stuff on DVD in the near future. This is only the start of something really good, although I wish they hadn't become so widely known, compared to back in the '90s. There is a lot of material missing from \\"Arriving Somewhere...\\" setlist, and I don't understand why it was omitted (Shesmovedon, Deadwing, Radioactive Toy). The question that comes up in my mind is: \\"Why release a DVD from the \\"Deadwing\\" tour and not put the title track on?\\"<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent, although they could've shown more of SW and the band. Personally, I think they honed in on the audience too much, and one of the cameramen went as far as zooming in pretty close on some salt-pepper bear-ish guy in the front row. PT are a fantastic band, but we need to see more of Steven Wilson & the band members...and not some shy & out-of-place audience member. Finally, the guy appeared rather uncomfortable, knowing he was in the spotlight on camera. Picture quality wasn't too great at times, and there were lots of grainy shots here & there. Also, I found it distracting when the picture would go from grainy to clear (in color) to black & white and back to grainy color & clear again (in color). I know this was done on purpose, but come on, it was quite distracting. What i did like were the closeups (not only of SW's face, but the band & instruments as well). Being a huge fan of the mellotron & keyboard arrangements in music (generally), I enjoyed seeing those zoomed in shots.<br /><br />I've been a loyal fan of PT since '99, when I first heard the Stupid Dream CD playing in a local music store. Since then, I've bought nearly everything PT have released. Having seen PT three times in Montreal (in person).....twice for In Absentia and once for Deadwing, I've come to realize it's far better to experience PT live and then watch this DVD, than to watch the DVD without first experiencing a live PT show in person. Given the songs the setlist is lacking, I'm a tad disappointed. But, like I said, the sound quality is superior and I appreciate owning the item. We pre-ordered ours from Burningshed too, but ours isn't one of the limited edition with postcards & number (a minor error), although we were among the 2000 who pre-ordered. Nevertheless, am still happy to own the item and will watch it from time to time without wearing it out. ;-) All the bonus features are super and have by far, met my expectations.

B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is really cute and kept my 4 year old and 2 year old entertained. It has nothing scary in it, which is hard to find these days.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I put it in just to check one song (saving the actual concert for having a few friends over to watch it)and next thing I knew it was over WOW!!! I don't know what caused this lineup to part ways but it was a huge mistake. Eric Czar matched Joe lick for lick. I've been a power trio junkie since my 1st concert (Cream) and these guys are at the head of the class. My only complaint is that I wou't be able to see this line-up live.
B00005JP81|4.0|Good movie but not great like everyone says it is. Great acting by everyone in the film.  Towards the end when Don goes to his parents house I really wondered when and how is this film going to end. My brain couldnt take the sadness much anymore. I was glad when this film was over because it's a real downer.
B000784WMW|4.0|There have been several films or series versions of Jane Eyre out there, but I've only seen this one.  This 1983 adaptation of the Charlotte Bronte classic brings up the best things I like about the book with brilliant performances, but Timothy Dalton (of James Bond fame) takes the cake here!  All of us who have read Jane Eyre know about the orphan girl who is sent to a boarding school by her uncaring aunt and the struggles she goes through in that school and how she grows to be a teacher and later governess at the Thornfield Hall, where she meets the brooding Mr. Rochester, falls in love with him and discovers his secrets.  All I can say about this production is that it brings the emotions and twists known from one of, if not the best gothic love story ever written.<br /><br />As said earlier, Timothy Dalton brings Mr. Rochester to life in a compelling performance.  He is able to portray Mr. Rochester as the dark, brooding, complex hero with a deep secret and fascination for plain Jane in a way that touched me very much, especially in the last episode, where I was brought to tears.  Dalton is gorgeous, which I find strange, for Rochester is often described as being unattractive in the book.  Bronte went as far as describing him as being ugly in several occasions.  But it doesn't matter.  It is nice to have some eye candy in an adaptation.  Besides, Timothy Dalton's acting is topnotch and that, to me, is the most important thing.  And I couldn't have pictured a better person for Mr. Rochester, who I always liked more than Mr. Darcy in any event.  I was underwhelmed, however, with Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre.  Even though she was properly cast due to her plain looks (or at least she was made to look plain), I don't think she captured Jane's independent spirit enough.  The whole point to an adaptation is to show Charlotte Bronte's impressive views on feminism -- impressive because her views were far ahead of her time.  Clarke lacked a certain... something and I'm disappointed with her performance.  I do like how the actress brings to life Jane's quiet confidence though.  And I do like the chemistry between Clarke and Dalton because they made you feel the romantic and sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester throughout the series.  Clarke gave her best performances when she worked with Dalton, who I once again have to duly praise his sensual delivery of Rochester.  I was also duly impressed with young Sian Pattenden as the ten-year-old Jane Eyre.  Her acting was quite impressive and she played the heroine just as I had imagined her to be as a child.  All in all, this miniseries with eleven half-hour episodes is wonderful.  The quality of the production isn't the best I've seen, but considering this was filmed in 1983, I think it does the book justice.  I highly recommend this BBC production, if only for Timothy Dalton as the striking Mr. Rochester.ointed with her performance.

031236198X|5.0|Organizational culture change has always been a fuzzy concept to communicate.  Being an airline pilot at a major US commercial carrier, I have been involved in the safety culture change effort known as Crew Resource Management (CRM) for the past 20 years.  This effort targeted improvement of knowledge, skills and attitudes for safer flight crew performance and accident prevention.  Faced with similar human factors challenges, the healthcare industry is adopting CRM principles to create change across large health systems including the Military Health System.  As a member of this change team, we were fortunate to be able to use a pre-publication copy of Our Iceberg is Melting in our change management course for core change leaders.  These clinicians have little time to read other Kotter books so this book is perfect as a simple 45 minute homework assignment.  The characters are easily identified in all of our workplaces and particpants come away with a clear focus of the challenges and path they must take towards real, sustainable change in their organizations.  I wish we had this book in aviation during our change efforts, in fact, I felt a strong connection to the seagulls.  Some particpants have reported reading the book as a bedtime story to their kids. Hmm, school work? Chores? Read this book and use it as a front line resource for lasting change.  <br /> <br />Steve Powell, Airline Captain
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I'm so glad the producers of this version of the debut by Boston didn't fall prey to the idea of 'making a great thing' better.  Instead, the only changes I've noticed is that the sound fills up my stereo a little better than the old version of this cd (or the LP for that matter).<br /><br />The effect is that you get to hear what the original purchasers of the Boston LP heard if they were lucky enough to own a high end stereo.  I wasn't one of those folks so I'm very happy to hear what I should have been hearing all along.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|This movie shows a regilious, oppressive, totalitarian regime that does not tolerate other religions, gays, and secular art or music --- hmmmm, does this remind you of any present-day nation?  However, in the movie the totalitarian regime is run by Christian Fundamentalists reminiscent of Hitler with a double cross as its symbol.  The secret police carry badges bearing the double cross symbol and rapes innocent women staying out past curfew.  A key good guy is a gay TV show host who keeps an Arabic version of the Koran becaus he likes to read it as poetry (in Arabic?!!).  This movie will insult your intelligence if you take it seriously.  It reminded me of \\"Sum of All Fears,\\" where wealthy old neo-nazis, not Islamic Fundamentalistics, exploded a nuclear bomb in the U.S.  The heavy-handed political correctness in the movie just ruins the credibility of the plot.  The theme of people willing to give up personal liberty for safety is worth thoughful consideration and is reflective of the choices we need to make today to counter terrorism.  However, in the movie the need for safety was created by fake acts of terrorism engendered by the Christian Funadmentalist government to secure more power, not by external terrorists.  I commend the producers for their courage in bashing Christian Fundamentalists, without any fear of repercussions as depicted in the movie. <br /> <br />Apart from the laughably strained political correctness, the movie had excellent cinematography, good acting, but little action.  I was expecting a lot more fight sequences from a movie written by the Wachowski brothers, but there was only one good fight sequence which occurred near the end.
B000000W5F|5.0|How can anyone give less than 5 stars to the cd where we finally get 'Start Me Up'?  The rest of Tatto You is pretty good too.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the spaced out mellow 2nd side.  'Tops' and 'Heaven' are incredible songs.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|This reissue is a MUST-HAVE for anyone that likes Tusk.  The remastering is outstanding, and as is written in the liner notes, the recording sounds like a million dollars.  I guarantee you'll experience this album unlike you never had before.  Listen with a pair of headphones in particular, and you'll notice never-before-heard details.  There's an incredible amount of music crammed into each and every song.   I've compared this to a very clean vinyl pressing, and it sounds fantastic.  Yes, I am a pre-1990s vinyl junkie, and it has been wonderful to hear the recording as the artists intended, with no pops, clicks, and groove hiss, etc., to boot.  Unlike the previous CD issue, this remastered version truly does render the double record obselete, a mere novelty.  So, if you are debating about saving a few bucks with the non-remastered CD, forget it; buy this reissue or don't get Tusk on CD, period.  Also, after listening to several remastered recordings from the 1970s and 1980s, this is at the top of the heap.  In some cases, I still prefer the vinyl, but not with Tusk anymore. <br />    <br />  The Second disc is a real gem, particularly for obsessive fans of Tusk and/or Fleetwood Mac.  Unlike other reviewers, I have listened to the bonus disc many times, and will continue to do so.  On the whole, the demos, roughs, and outtakes are presented in fairly advanced form.  It's not really comparable to the Beatles Anthology, as I recall, with rougher outtakes, and really rare mixes, but it opens the door a bit into the Tusk recording sessions, and how Fleetwood Mac developed songs.  There are also a few single and alternate versions included.  I've heard that Kiss and Run and Farmer's Daughter sound the same as on the Fleetwood Mac Live double album, but haven't heard that in so long, I cannot confirm.   <br />    <br />  The ONLY negative in this reissue is that the original album version of Sara is NOT included.  The shorter single version is on disc one, and thereis a rough, longer version on disc two. It's disappointing, but this is the only compromise you must make to enjoy this excellent remastered CD reissue.   <br />  <br />   The packaging is about as good as standard size jewel cases can be.  The liner notes are interesting; there are lots of additional photos; and the lyrics are included.       <br />  <br />If you are just being adventurous and are the type of listener that goes beyond top-40, I hope you won't hesitate to give Tusk a chance and spin it through a few times.  It captures Fleetwood Mac at its creative peak with no commercial constraints.  Nothing else in the discography compares to this album.  Rumors is very enjoyable, but this album hints at genius.
0380018179|5.0|This is one of those classic books, that never get old. I grew up watching the movie, and did not read the book until I was 17. I thought, oh, this is not going to be nearly as good. Quite the opposite! This was such an enriching, lovely drama. Tragic, sure. Yet, there is hope, love, and all things enternal to human lives and love.<br /><br />Read this book if you are a huge fan of the movie. Its better than the movie in so many ways. You learn more about Mary Carson, you see more of Fee's true character (and her family!!), and why Frank and Paddy are the way they are. Of course, you see in full play Meggie & Father Ralph as they grow up together, and fight the other through love, time, & religion.<br /><br />So worth your time! I read it at least once a year!!! :)
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie lives in a dream world and acts like a child when she is a grown woman, because she is afraid of life.  In the end she must decide to go after the man she loves and accept the pain of real life.  What starts as a view of the life of a girl becomes much more.
B000F0UV0E|2.0|I am amazed at the high rating of this CD by so many. I am a huge fan of both of these musicians. Emmylou's voice is a one of a kind gift that I will treasure until I die. Being a guitar player myself I have been a Mark Knopfler fan for what must be nearing 30 years. Sultans of Swing knocked me out and to this day still does. Dire Straits, Solo, Knotting Hillbillies, with Chet, and movie soundtracks.... I have enjoyed the ride. But this album just leaves me empty. I have that feeling I get when I see some old act revived on one of those specials and I watch an aging musician struggle to get that old magic back. The thing is....that's not the problem. Mark still plays the guitar as well as ever and Emmylou's voice is still a diamond. It is the material. These songs are just lame in my opinion. I bought this CD without having heard a cut, simply out of respect for my love of these two heroes. I am trading this disk in and playing some vinyl of Luxery Liner to cleanse my palate. I might have to go all the way back to Gram Parsons' album to remember when I fell for Emmylou in the first place.
B0001CKGOM|5.0|Given the number of excellent movies that have been made about sailing ships and the breadth of coverage of those movies, at first you might wonder how yet another movie is going to add anything to the genre. If you have seen this movie you need no answer to that question. This story is as compelling as \\"Moby Dick,\\" and the captain of H.M.S. Surprise is just as driven as Captain Ahab, though generally not mad as was Ahab.<br /><br />The story at first appears to be a classic story of a strategic sea chase between two captains. However, it cannot be, for the pursuer and the pursued frequently change position, and the English pursuer is the weaker of the two opponents. In order to have any chance against an enemy with longer range guns, more speed, and a nearly impenetrable hull, Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) will need luck, bravery, and a superb strategy. Fortunately all three will eventually work in his favor, at least sufficiently to make a grand finish to this movie.<br /><br />Three things set this movie apart from its predecessors.<br /><br />First, the detail in this movie is incredibly good. The research into the conditions about a sailing ship of this era was apparently quite extensive as the details in the operation of the ship were numerous. Details regarding the relationships between the officers and crew also appeared quite authentic, recalling from my dim past the book \\"Two Years Before the Mast.\\" While it would be easy to dismiss the attention to detail, that very detail makes much of this movie a delight to watch.<br /><br />Secondly, the two captains were every bit as crafty as any two captains have ever been portrayed. We only see the results of the French captain's efforts, but we see the result of those efforts on Captain Aubrey, and we realize that Captain Aubrey has met someone with a talent that is at least equal to his own. We have seen similar scenarios in movies such as \\"The Enemy Below\\" and \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\\" and yet in every one of these movies the scenario, while similar, is sufficiently different that you will find the course of the movie and the ending to be different.<br /><br />Third, the special effects benefit from decades of development of computer generated imagery. In the movies of days gone by the special effects would rely heavily on miniature ships floating about in a big pool. In this movie the special effects are so good that, just as in \\"Jurassic Park,\\" you never know when you are looking at a ship and when you are looking at computer graphics. While there are places where you can guess computer images were used, try not to focus on that aspect too much because it can distract you from the story.<br /><br />Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Captain Aubrey, well supported by a similarly excellent cast. \\"Master and Commander\\" received ten nominations for Academy Awards in 2003, and in any other year would likely have won many more awards than the two it won, but \\"The Return of the King\\" overshadowed this superb historical fiction. It is gratifying to see such quality in film making. This movie is well worth five stars and then some.<br /><br />Enjoy!d yet in every one of these movies the scenario, while similar, is sufficiently different that you will find the course of the movie and the ending to be different. <br /> <br />Third, the special effects benefit from decades of development of computer generated imagery.

B000002HPV|5.0|I had a similar experience with Homogenic as some other reviewers- what once seemed cold and alienating became my personal favorite.<br /><br />Homogenic could be regarded as Bjork's bridge album.  The early part of her solo career established her as a late-night MTV video darling, and alterna-pop culture icon.  Later on, cynicism set in, and she became a walking punchline, turning up on worst-dressed lists, not to mention celebrities gone bezerk.  Coincidentially, her music became more personal and obtuse, alienating passers-by, but endearing her more to the faithful.<br /><br />If you liked the It's Oh So Quiet incarnation of Bjork, well, she left the party quite some time ago.  In her place is Hunter Bjork.  Hunter throws down the gauntlet, mildly shocking you with its sinuous, military-march beat and eleventh-hour urgency.  This song quickly became a favorite, even before I came to appreciate the album as a whole.  Interestingly, Bjork said in an interview that this song is about having to \\"output\\" as a music artist, so that the small army of assistants around you can continue to have work.  It's a very pithy statement. Bjork infers that if she's gonna output, it won't be the usual cutesy-pie, cuddly affairs that come at the expense of artistic sensibility.<br /><br />Joga, the first single, is a triumph, every bit as urgent as Hunter, and perfectly crafted.  Here and elsewhere on Homogenic, Bjork proves that strings-and-synth is a potent combination.  Unravel, the third track, foreshadows later albums.  It has a rather morose, almost funereal atmosphere.  It's a love song, but the mood is brooding and wistful.  Midway through, an organ piano is introduced, lending a dirge-like element.<br /><br />Bachelorette could just as well be titled Isobel, Act II. I say \\"Act II\\" and not \\"part two,\\" because this is NOT just a repeat song with different lyrics.  It builds on the operatic quality of Isobel (from Post), quickening the pulse and emotion.  The twin nature of Isobel and Bachelorette is a firm testament to Bjork's musicianship.<br /><br />All Neon Like is the only weak link in Homogenic, in my opinion.  The lyics are fascinating, but that \\"duh-duh, dum-dum-dum\\" bassline beat irritates.  Far better is Five Years.  Now, this is Bjork that fascinates me.  First, the harsh reproachment of a former lover is compelling.  Bjork doesn't indulge in Alanis Morrisette \\"You Oughta Know\\" histrionics.  Her statement is bolder, less cliche.  She won't torch your clothes and your car, but she'll dare you, and take you to task for being a coward who can't handle a serious relationship.  I just love the way she sings, \\"I dare you\\" with every fiber of her being.  Second, the sonic landscape.  The song is dominated early on by a harsh beat that's like a distorted transmission from outer space, or a foray though an asteroid belt.  Then, it yield to ravishing strings.  This is pure genius.<br /><br />Immature bears the closest resemblance to her earlier albums.  The sound has a percolating, almost jazzy feel.  The lyrics are very minimal, but the way she sings them is addictive.  I can't help but want to sing along.  The feel-good sentiment continues with Alarm Call.<br /><br />Pluto is the most extreme song of the album, a blistering barrage of sounds, like sparks flying from a blown-out circuit.  Her distorted vocals make her sound like she sang them through a high-speed fan.<br /><br />From the harsh landscape of Pluto emerges All is Full of Love.  The ethereal, mellifluous strings and lovingly-sung lyrics end the album on a sublime note.  It doesn't hurt that the video made for the song is one of the very best ever made.<br /><br />Homogenic is a brilliantly executed album, one that will reward you time and again.re of Isobel and Bachelorette is a firm testament to Bjork's musicianship.   <br /> <br />All Neon Like is the only weak link in Homogenic, in my opinion.

B000BCE918|5.0|This set is one of the better Jurassic Park sets.  Each disk contains a lot of extras, many of which are fun to watch.  Fans of the trilogy that have yet to buy the DVDs will find this set a great one to have.<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park\\" introduced us to digital dinosaurs and how fearsome they could be with modern computer technology. This movie advanced horror and monster movies in a method similar to the way \\"Alien\\" advanced science fiction movies. \\"Jurassic Park\\" immediately became an audience favorite and the new standard by which special effects would be judged. Stephen Spielberg effectively combined in-your-face terror with special effects to keep people at the edge of their seats and in awe of life-like creatures dinosaurs.<br /><br />\\"The Lost World\\" unfortunately did not measure up to \\"Jurassic Park.\\" Many of the characters were unbelievable and there were too many plot holes that were too readily visible to make the movie enjoyable from beginning to end. While there were several parts of the movie that were well-done, there were at least as many parts where the actions of the characters were unrealistic. The bumps in the actions of the characters just did not allow me to focus on the plot throughout. Another problem with this movie is that it focused too much on action, and very little on the characters themselves. Thus, the movie comes across as more of a cartoon than a horror movie.<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park III\\" simplified the plot, added new dinosaurs, and allowed the characters to develop more than \\"The Lost World.\\" The short length of the movie forced the movie to be simpler than the previous movie, and that simplicity makes for a good movie. The best new dinosaur in this movie had to be the pteranodons, though the spinosaur was great also. The characters in this movie generally acted as I would expect them to, and there were fewer outright acts of stupidity. Even the theft of a raptor egg was done in ignorance. So while it was a convenient plot device, you would expect something like that by someone with only minimal knowledge of dinosaurs. I was very happy to see Sam Neill returning in the role of Dr. Alan Grant. His character particularly is very believable.<br /><br />Enjoy!device, you would expect something like that by someone with only minimal knowledge of dinosaurs.

B000000H3Z|5.0|If you want a good introduction to Sepultura, this isn't the best place to start(check out either Roots, their last good album, or Chaos A.D., which is one of the finest metal albums of all time). After you check those out, get Arise, which is also one of the best metal albums ever. If you enjoyed that,then run straight to your nearest C.D. store and buy this right away! Now, onto the album. While their next album,Arise, has a more Metallica and Iron Maiden inspired sound, this one is much more remenicent of Slayer or Morbid Angel. With that said, this album does NOT ever let up; it's just straight up, all out thrash/death metal, with some awesome solos and tight songwriting to boot. In fact, this album is so awesome, you wouldn't be crazy to say that it trumps even the Slayer classic \\"Reign in Blood\\", which to anyone who has heard that amazing album may seem like a bold statement. I argue that this very well might be the best metal album of all time, but if you just wanna rock out, then you definitly could do much worse. Very highly recommended to anyone who likes any form of metal.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I love this series, The second season is just as intriguing as the first. I can't wait till the 3rd season come on.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|I have been a fan of NIN since 1990, and although they have a rather sparse collection of major works (4 LPs and 2 EPs), The Downward Spiral is by FAR the closest thing to perfection that any work of art can ever aspire to.  From the opening words of \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\" to the final verse of \\"Hurt\\", one's mind and soul are taken for a non-stop emotional rollercoaster, albeit a downward one.  Even today with sensibilities that have become so jaded, this album will make an impression on ANY enlightened, intelligent mind.
B0000019PA|5.0|i've been with this album for some time now but i thought it fitting to write that there is no other album out that i listen to straight through more than this one... kinda funny that my roomate walked in today and i had just started the first tune... we talked a bit and i apologized and kindly said i had to get back to the album.  it's a masterpiece.  i've been reading some of these reviews regarding jeff's voice and that's part of what makes it... lyrics and arrangements are beautiful.  i consider this one of the greatest albums eva.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|This album has everything you could ask for but the big hit. It is by far my favorite Dire Straits album and for good reason. Every song is good in it's own way. Once Upon A Time In The West and Lady Writer are the best but all the songs here are good.
B00005NVT1|5.0|First of all, so you know how good this CD is, I must admit that this is my first review in 3 years. With this album, I just had to make this step.    Let me start with saying that for the last 2 or 3 years I didn't lay my hands on a CD that would totally blow my mind. It has changed recently thanks to Alive 1997.    If you don't like electronic music that sounds a bit repetitive - this is not for you. But if you like it, or you are open minded and like to discover new grounds - give it a try (you won't regret). The only thing you should do before buying this live album is buying HOMEWORK by Daft Punk or at least listening to Da Funk, Rollin&Scratchin and Alive. Homework is their first and in my opinion best effort (only minority prefers Discovery I guess). When you will be totally fed up with the tracks like Da Funk, Rollin&Scratchin and Alive (if it's possible) turn on this live album. It is by far the best live recording I have ever heard. There is only one track on the whole CD (which in my opinion is good, because it stops you from messing around with this 45-minute masterpiece) which contains big parts of the songs I mentioned before. I had to take my jaw back from the floor after the first listen. Too bad I missed it 5 long years ago, when it was released. And when you think it's great after 10-15 minutes it gets even better.    I had the oportunity to see The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers which was a stunning experience for me (too bad they didn't record any of their shows to make an LP), but after listening to this CD by Daft Punk I can say that I was also on Le Daft Punk gig. This album is so real, that everytime you listen to it, your legs and hands won't stop moving, and you feel like you are there listening to them live.    And I'm not even a big fan of DP. I think that every next album is worse from the previous one (only my humble opinion), but fortunately for me this one contains only songs from their first effort. The songs on this live set change into something you have never heard before - but you really love it (of course if Homework is the thing that moves you). There are so many unsuspected changes in tempo, volume etc.    When I heard this CD for the first time I decided that I have to see them live as soon as possible. After a while I discovered that they probably don't play shows like this anymore (after all so much has happened in their career since 1997).     It has only one disadvantage... it's way too short, it's not the whole gig, instead it fades out during alive and you only wish it would last forever...
B000024D4R|5.0|As far as my opinion goes this is my favorite Pink Floyd album. I am a huge fan and like all their music but this one is just amazing. It also seems unfair how under appreciated this album is. It may not have that one huge hit as some of the other albums had, but this one is classic Floyd. Must have for any fan of classic rock music.
0618551050|5.0|This is an extremely fine book.  Mr. Smolin gives an overview of twentieth century physics and explains developments in both string theory and quantum gravity (along with some other concepts that have not been popularized).  He does a nice job of exposing groupthink in academic physics departments and he seeks an environment where free-thinkers and seers are encouraged and rewarded instead of promoting another five hundred un-inventive number-crunchers. <br /> <br />Cheers and kudos for Mr. Smolin!  This groupthink seems as bad in academia as it is in the business world.   <br /> <br />And more cheers for Mr. Smolin encouraging significantly more study regarding the foundations of quantum theory and relativity!  I went to bed last night thinking about these foundations, trying to understand both relativity and quantum theory at the most fundamental level.  As my head hit the pillow, I thought... <br /> <br />Question:  How is it that relativity is a classical, continuous and causative concept while quantum mechanics is discrete and probabilistic?   <br /> <br />Potential Answer:  Space is an emergent phenomena resulting from a probabilistic mathematical construct contained within the sub-quantum level.  When the probabilities sum to one, a node of spacetime emerges.  These nodes are one Planck-length apart and spacetime only appears continuous because our present mathematical constructs don't allow us to penetrate further (than the Planck-length).  The key here is that seemingly causative continuity EMERGES from discreteness and, ultimately, probability.  If we could see the sub-quantum smaller than the Planck-length, we might even see the process of node formation as probability approaches one.  In effect, the birth of space (or a space-node) itself. <br /> <br />If true, mathematics or statistics becomes more primary than space itself.  And if true, this implies that math or statistics is more primary than geometry.   <br /> <br />Okay, now what about `time'? <br/> <br />Time is a classical and continuous concept.  We can measure time in various ways, such as the `time' it takes for a photon to transverse some distance (such as an atom).  But we are ultimately measuring change when we do this.  The photon was at point A when we started and now it is a point B.  The position has changed.  So time really has meaning only when something has changed, and by measuring this change, time can be thought of as geometric or spatial.  (Remember now that geometry is not primary...)  And, of course, changes are `caused' (and explained in the classical, continuous and causative concepts imbedded in relativity).  The key here, however, is that without change, what are we measuring with regard to the classical concept of `time'?  The answer is nothing.  Time does not occur because nothing has changed.  We have a still photograph or one frame instead of a movie.  <br /> <br />So time is also an emergent phenomena, along with space (and geometry).  Until a node of special fabric is formed, there is no time because there is no space, because without space... nothing can change.  Until a space-node is formed, we only have the possibility of space.  (We only have statistics.)  Once a node is formed, we have the reality and geometry of space.  And eventually... causation and change. <br /> <br />Thus, space and time are emergent phenomena.  In sum, we can say that relativity emerges from the sub-quantum, and geometry emerges from statistics.    <br /> <br />So there you have it... that's when I fell to sleep.  I think I may have read somewhere, and it might have been Roger Penrose, who said that mathematics was invented or formed to explain geometry...a way of understanding our physical world.  I believe it is ironic that it may indeed be the other way around, and that geometry is not primary at all, as explained above.  After all, geometry makes no sense at all at a sub-quantum level smaller than a Planck-length.   <br /> <br />So, in the beginning there is just an idea, an abstraction.  Possibility. <br /> <br />Maybe more people should be studying statistics in high school instead of geometry.      <br />
B000002L99|1.0|I really really really like Van Halen, but when David Lee Roth left that just did it for me. Even though Eddie still jams just as good as before I just don't like Hagar. For me Roth's voice made this band just that much better. Even though he thought he was bigger than the band his deparcher for me was the end of a great band. Van Halen was great, but Van Hagar is less then ok.
B000H305U0|5.0|The review title says it all the album is superb.Justin has completely changed his style lyrically & idealistically but kept his great singing voice & combined the best of both. The first five songs are in my opinion enough to merit the meagre cost of the cd & anyone who is a fan of great music is making a big mistake if they don't buy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> The title track come with lyrics like \\"cuz all i need is a moment alone 2 give u my tongue & put u outta control, after u let it in the skin 2 skin is just so natural\\" which being on such a hypnotic & alluring beat causes you to want to listen to it over & over. Sexy back is more of a grown up techno jam with a catchy hook. My love is one of the great love songs of this era with justin professing his love with the help of T.I. who gives it a release of sorts by means of his rapping. Lovestoned is the final song about which i will write as my fingers are getting tired ;) it is a great song for all you feminist & male chauvanists alike and is another superb combo of lyrics & rhythm of the beat.   <br /> <br /> <br />Over all The album is great and I gave it five stars cuz it deserves it the only thing that could've been better is the album cover & back.
B000002I2M|5.0|This was by far the best Doors album that they put out. After everything that they went through putting up with Jim this was a masterpiece. This album really showd that Jim could write some amazing songs.  <br />Riders On The Storm was a perfect ending for this unique band and Jim Morrison. I can listen to this album all the way through over and over again.  <br />Every song is a ten in my book. This was probly the last of the Doors anyway, but who knows what could have been.
B00005JMYI|5.0|\\"It seems our youngest, Chris was on something called acid and was firing a bow and arrow into a crowd.\\" <br /> <br />\\"No, Ron's coming, its the pancake breakfast, we do it every month.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I woke up in some japanese family's rec room and they would NOT....stop...screaming.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Brick, are you just looking around the office and saying you love things as you see them?\\" <br /> <br />I mention these lines to most people and a smile appears.  That is what a comedy is supposed to do.  People complain about Will Ferrell dropping in and out of the Ron Burgundy accent haven't considered that is Ron Burgundy's character.  When trying to sound masculine, intellectual, intimidating the accent kicks in.  This movie is funny, funny, funny with great performances all around.  Who could have imagined a trident being used to kill another newsman who incidently was dragging a rival newsman away using a horse and a net? <br /> <br />I can never grow tired of this movie.  \\"This burrito is delicious but it is filling.\\"
B00097DX3U|5.0|I really like all three of their albums but this one is by far the best one. Every song on this album is just awesome.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|This album is Diana at her best. She does the standards, and very well. The guys behind her do there job, and really swing. As a muscian I really appreciate her, and her talent. <br />                              Al Forman
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is great for any true Beatles fan. You have to understand the time and who the Beatles were to really appreciate this album. The drugs were at full use for this one and it shows from the lyrics just like a lot of other Beatles songs. I have never heard a Beatles songs that I didn't like and take no exceptions for this album.  <br />As this album goes I think disk 1 is better then disk 2 as a whole. I really like the stories in songs like 'Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill' and 'Rocky Raccoon'.  <br />The hardest song to listen to on this album is 'Revolution 9' But it really fits in whith everything else on this cd.  <br />Must have for any Beatles fan or someone looking for something new that is old.
B0002I831S|5.0|This is the first and best season of TOS.  Some of my own favorites from this season are \\"Miri\\" guest starring Kim Darby on a duplicate Earth (though a cloudless one) where only kids have survived a longevity experiment gone haywire.  But Grup Kirk comes to the rescue with \\"NO BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!\\"  and Kim's subtlety is a good foil to Shatner's intensity.  Also here is one of the \\"kids\\" Michael Pollard who was 26 at the time.  That one kid is so annoying, the one who always shouts \\"BONK BONK ON THE HEAD!\\"  Spock, who a few episodes earlier was saying stuff like, \\"Ah yes, one of your Earth emotions\\", is here explaining Miri's emotions to the others.<br /><br />  Another good one is Charlie X who sees Janis and asks Kirk, \\"Is that a girl?\\"  Actually a poignant take on adolescence guest stars Robert Walker Jr.  After Charlie says, \\"No laughing\\", that girl without the face is always scary.<br /><br />  The Naked Time is ill-conceived, though a vehicle for developing the show for later superior episodes.  The Enemy Within is good with the dubplicate Kirk. The Conscience of the King is here, the war criminal one and some Shakespeare thrown in.  Galileo Seven and yes, \\"City on the Edge of Forever\\" closes out the Season.<br /><br />  Some comments on \\"City\\".  How exactly does Edith Keeler influence FDR to delay entry into the war... do they mean AFTER Pearl Harbor he delayed?  Hmmm.  Also Uhuru's comment to Kirk, \\"Happiness at least sir\\" was so out of place...though not as much as her comments during his recent roast.
B000002KHB|5.0|This is one of the best albums (any artist) of all time. Deep Purple really made a masterpiece with this one. I really can't put into words just how good this album is. From start to finish. Smoke On The Water as famous as that song is, is far from the best song on this album. My favorite song is Lazy with its killer organ intro and then it just takes off and rocks. Great album and could be the best ever.
B0006GAOJA|3.0|I made it 20-something years without seeing this film, and I finally caved and bought it on the cheap.  It's good enough to spend $10 on, but I can't see anybody watching it more than 2 or 3 times, tops.<br /><br />The film follows the life and career of an Italian boxer in the 40's and 50's.  It is filmed in black and white, and the visual style is solid.  The boxing scenes (and one of my biggest disappointments is that there aren't enough of them) are very exciting.  Although I have no idea if this played a part in Scorcese's decision to film in b&w, I suspect that if it were in color the boxing would have been too gruesome for most viewers.  LaMotta is basically squirting fluid all over the place in his last fight against Sugar Ray.<br /><br />In addition to covering LaMotta's career, the film follows his relationship with his brother, Joey, and his wife.  His levels of jealousy regarding his wife border on the inconceivably insane, and consequently that entire dimension of the film is unbelievable.  Quite frankly, LaMotta would have to be mentally disabled to act that stupid.<br /><br />The film also suffers from a slow start.  We eventually do care about LaMotta, but it takes awhile.<br /><br />But ultimately, why do we really care?  We never see a single scene that shows us why he loves his wife, nor one that shows why his wife loves him.  They date, they fool around, they marry (in a montage), they fight, and then after all the bad times are apparently behind them she does something she should have done years ago.  Their relationship makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />In the end, we see LaMotta (in a scene most younger viewers will think was lifted from the end of \\"Boogie Nights\\") quoting verbatim a lengthy monologue from a much better movie, \\"On the Waterfront\\".  That's a good point, I must admit... why didn't I spend the last 2 hours watching \\"On the Waterfront\\" instead?
B000002I2I|5.0|I really like this album probly as about the third best behind The Doors and LA Woman.<br /><br />Roadhouse Blues is a classic and a perfect way to start this album.<br /><br />Waiting For The Sun is another great song as all the songs are. Jim Morrison shows again some of his poetic side with songs like The Spy and Blue Sunday. Possibly the best song on this album is the final track Maggie M'Gill. Very catchy lyrics and a very good sound. The Doors really did a good job with this one.
B000002J1M|5.0|Having grown up in the 80's, I really didn't understand what this band had once been until I became reinterested in prog rock.  The first time I got into prog, in high school, I became fixated on Yes and Jethro Tull and ELP.  Then through happenstance I listened to \\"Red\\" by King Crimson while a grad student, and I soon found myself immersed in the genre for a second go-round.  It was only during this renewed fascination with prog rock that I really discovered Genesis as they had been, as they are on this album.<br /><br />There are clearly four *essential* Genesis albums from the Peter Gabriel era.  Among those four, I actually suggest that this one be the first album for a listener new to the music.  The side-long \\"Supper's Ready\\" is fairly similar to other prog rock of the era and makes this album the most familiar-sounding to fans of the genre.  Overall \\"Foxtrot\\" isn't as lyrically and thematically dense as the supposed magnum opus of the band, \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.\\"<br /><br />Musically, it's much closer to Tull than to King Crimson, despite my own and many other's references to Crimson when discussing Genesis.  Unlike King Crimson, Genesis' essential albums from this period (including \\"Foxtrot\\", of course) are more consistently good throughout the album.  King Crimson made only two albums that were consistently good throughout, \\"In the Court...\\" and \\"Red\\" (which sounds nothing like any other prog rock made, so isn't a good comparison.)  Genesis is lightyears ahead of \\"In the Court...\\", as it is also lightyears ahead of early ELP.<br /><br />Although they get 0% of the radioplay that ELP, Yes and Jethro Tull get, they are every bit as good.  Classic rock radio can completely overlook them, but if you like those other bands then you shouldn't make the same mistake.<br /><br />At the listed price of around $10, this is a very good buy.
B000E33VWW|3.0|This movie is emotionally intense at times, but other than that I did not find it unique. Philip Seymore Hoffman's performance is what is worth watching. He is awesome-- his physically transformation and the way he affects Truman Capote's mannerisms is astounding. But the story is dull and the charactors uninteresting. In Cold Blood, the book, would be a better choice. I did like its depiction of Capote and Harper Lee's friendship, because I had know previously that he was Dill in To Kill a Mockingbird, but not that they remained close friends into adulthood.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Every saga or legend has it's group of fanatics. I'm sure someone told Goldilocks and the Three Bears better than most. I love this series like many others. I have purchased a few versions. I believe in keeping things intact but I am also open to changes. I am one of the few (if any) that likes both presentaions of this film series. I own the THX widescreen VHS trilogy because I thought it would be the best available. I also own the silver 2004 box set. Like many I was curious about this release. <br /> <br />Now, opinions are like...stars. Many, many out there. The theatrical versions of these DVD's are fine. There are certain imperfections but they're not that obvious. The picture is clear and rather crisp for an \\"untouched\\" print. The 2004 LucasVision prints are beautiful of course. If you're debating...if you like your THX widescreen tapes...I WOULD recommend buying this. VCR's can't protect your tapes forever. These are worth the money and they are enjoyable. The sound is decent as well. I have good but \\"square\\" televisions. I'm sure if I had a two thousand dollar plasma widescreen whatever then I might have some of the complaints that those do.  <br /> <br />However, if you like your TV and have a good tint with sharp picture then these are the best on the market. Will others come? Probably. But FOX and Lucas have given some fans what they want. I don't blame or hate him. He said he could never please everyone. Perhaps he will have the last say and put everything in one big box and wrap it with a bow and charge three hundred dollars.  <br /> <br />Put simply, buy them if you're a STAR WARS lover.
0784011176|3.0|I have seen this movie a few times over the years, but it is not a movie that really grabs my attention or makes me want to watch again. I liked the unusual love story between Baines and Ada, but found the story of the movie odd. Everything about the movie is pretty dull.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|I saw this movie at the flicks today and it was dreadful.  It is so far-fetched and it has a makes-no-sense story line.  Stay away from it.
B00005JLO2|4.0|This beautiful film is very complex, with a few flaws, but overall a good exploration of the concept of commitment.  <br /> <br />Whereas the plot requires that the script be spun around the concept of cowardice, the four feather insult, and the lengthy redemption - there is an underlying and subtle theme of commitment that rings very true. <br /> <br />Commitment itself is a complex emotion since commitment to one person or idea may compete with commitment to other folks or ideas. This is the dilema that faces handsome Harry Haversham, played well by the ever changing chameleon Heath Ledger. <br /> <br />Harry has made a decision to join the army due to family commitments, specifically his father who is a general. He has made commitments to his buddies, his fellow soldiers. Thi is especially true for his commitment to his best friend, Jack Durrance (played beautifully by Wes Bentley). He has made commitments to his young fiance, Ethne Eustace, played by Kate Hudson. And he has commitments to himself, for he never wished to become a soldier and go to war. A British offensive in the Sudan is the catalyst for Harry to resign his commission as an officer in the army and leave the armed services. <br /> <br />Harry decides to honor the commitment to himself, imagining that his relationship with Ethne will not change. Yet she is deeply impacted and can not imagine their life together if they are social outcasts.  <br /> <br />And so, by honoring his commitment to himself, Harry does not honor his commitment to Queen and country, to his father, to his fiance, and to his buddies. After the fellows become fully sunk in the wasp nest of the Sudan, Harry becomes greatly concerned at the report of the high number of deaths of British soldiers. He makes his way to the Sudan to save and protect his buddies and redeem himself in the eyes of others. <br /> <br />During this dramatic struggle Harry undergoes some of the trials and tribulations of the hero, many of which are explained in the writings of Joseph Campbell. For example, in many myths regarding heroes, the hero shows kindness to a lesser being and in turn is rewarded. Harry shows kindness to an African tribal princess who spares his life when her tribesman kills the camel train leader.  <br /> <br />The struggles intensify as Harry becomes an observant pawn in a strategic struggle between Sudanese Islamic insurgents and British imperial troops. <br /> <br />At this point he meets Abu Fatma, played exceptionally well by Djimon Hounsou. Djimon is an absolute mountain of muscle, a giant imposing character. Here the film becomes Jungian for in many ways Abu is Harry's shadow, the confrontation with the dark side of the self which brings about a stronger integrated personality. In classic Jungian theory, the Shadow is at first feared,and then becomes a guide into deeper feelings, and finally is integrated into the personality resulting in a stronger character with greater insight and compassion. This is exactly what happens in this partnership between Harry and Abu. <br /> <br />In the end, Harry undertakes feats of incredible bravery and daring. He redeems himself in the eyes of those who saw him as a coward. He does this not only through brave acts but by integration of competing forces within his personality. Harry emerges a far more centered man after his encounter in the desert with his shadow. <br /> <br />There are other well developed sub-themes such as Jack Durrance's heroism and sacrifice first of his eyes and then of his relationship with Ethne.  <br /> <br />The film ends with a fine speech by Jack Durrance about commitment to an abstract Queen and country as compared to commitment to the flesh and blood concrete reality of those comrades with whom we have bonded. And thus this parable tells us that our first commitment is to self, and then to those we love, but there is sometimes a steep price to pay for our commitments. <br /> <br />The grand sweeping palaces of England and the desolate prisons hidden in  African deserts offer vastly different views of the world of the British Empire. The film takes us on a grand journey of the eyes and of the character.
B00007146Y|4.0|Based upon the wonderful, well-written novel \\"Red Dragon\\" by Thomas Harris, this is a superior and chilling thriller. Grim and gripping, it features Edward Norton in the role of troubled, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer, known as the \\"Tooth Fairy\\". It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mindset and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by Anthony Hopkins. Unfortunately for Graham, Hannibal has not forgotten that Graham was responsible for his changed circumstances.<br /><br />It is Hannibal Lecter, after all, who was the catalyst for Will Graham's retirement. The viewer is treated to scenes of Lecter's life, before he was revealed to be Hannibal the Cannibal, one of the sickest serial killers ever to strike. The viewer sees the renowned psychiatrist in his milieu as an erudite, cultured, and wealthy patron of the arts. A noted gourmand, Dr. Lecter liked nothing better than to give intimate dinner parties for the favored few. Of course, some of the ingredients used for his dinners were best left unsaid. It was nice to see the always excellent John Rubenstein in the small role of a dinner guest, heaping accolades upon Hannibal for his dinner parties.<br /><br />The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Anthony Hopkins reprises his career defining role and steals the show (Really, Hannibal Lecter has become all but a cottage industry for him!). With a twinkle in his eye, he is, in his low key way, deliciously malevolent. Edward Norton, one of the best young actors around, gives a decent and sensitive portrayal of Will Graham, the angst ridden former FBI agent and profiler, but lacks the grittiness and hard-edged veneer that the role really demands. He also simply looks too young and soft for the role. Ralph Fiennes gives a fine performance as the tormented Francis Dolarhyde, but his portrayal is hampered by the fact that too little is revealed in the film about what makes him tick.<br /><br />Emily Watson affectingly plays a blind woman who becomes romantically involved with Francis Dolarhyde. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Moreover, Ms. Watson is a wonderfully talented British actress who manages to get her American accent down pat. Good performances by Harvey Keitel, as Graham's former boss, and Mary Louise Parker, as Graham's wife, round out this fine, ensemble cast.<br /><br />This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is subject to comparison to its 1986 predecessor \\"Manhunter. Having seen both, I call it a draw. This current version had a bigger budget, so obviously it has better production values. Also, the opening scenes in the current version are more interesting than those in the 1986 one. Music, however, was used to much better effect in the earlier version. Moreover, the final scenes in the earlier version were much better than in this later version, as they were much more suspenseful. Both films, however, are well worth watching. Do yourself a favor and view both. Then, judge for yourself.soft for the role.

B00005QGAX|5.0|The BAD album is one of those albums that in 2006 it still sounds up 2 date and sets itself apart from da rest.  BAD is often considered a flop by music critics b/c it didn't sell over 50 million copies like Thriller, which is stupid as hell.  Bad sold over 20 million copies and became the first album to put up 5 #1 singles.  The album also wuz in the top 5 4 every week for 9 months.  The singles dat hit #1 were BAD, The Way U Make Me Feel, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Man in the Mirror and Dirty Diana.  Another Part of Me Hit #11 and Smooth Crimial hit #7.  Those singles are all great, along with the much underrated Liberian Girl, Just Good Friends and Leave Me Alone.  Just Good Friends sounds tight az hell with Stevie Wonder in it.  The Bonus edition also features 2 songs that should've made it onto da album- the fast up beat song Streetwalker and the tight pop/ballard Fly Away.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Like death and taxes, the only thing constant is the 'refusal to change with the trends' sound of Maiden. This is without a doubt their most progressive sounding album since the mid-80's. I have this album for over two weeks now and it has grown on me to the point where i can actually recognize each song based on a riff or a galloping bass line or guitar rhythm that comes up. Does that ever happen in 'metal' albums these days? The sound is raw and more angrier and grittier than the previous two revamped 6-man line-up releases. Brave New World was good . Dance of death, well except for Paschendale and Rainmaker, the less said about it the better. <br />I always felt it was more of a filler release. But this, this is what they all got back together to make. Bruce actually sounds so different on the first track i was wondering what happened to the air-raid siren, it is a typical mid-tempo album opener still not quite on par with 'The wicker man' but this is more melodic.  <br />Then comes 'These colors dont run' and you know that you are in for something different. Its all there the time changes, the galloping sound and you can actually make out the three different guitars. The album has not been mastered, to heck with it , the whole thing has a vibrant live feel to it. Its even got the 'woo hoo hoo hoo's ' which some people hate but i absolutely love it.  <br />Most of the songs here have the typical slow start and then Bruce airing his lungs out and the three guitar attack kicking in . People say thats what they always do. Well yes but who else does it better? thats why we keep coming back for more Maiden. Maiden have never written a song like 'Brighter than a Thousand Suns' ya sure there have been epics but this one sounds dark and angry like something straight off a Dickinson solo album from the late nineties.'For the greater good of God' has lyrics that make you think. Nicko's snare drum has a sound that i never heard in the last couple of albums. Bruce doesnt sound a day older than he did in the 80's and you know that no one else can ever sing these songs, they are tailor made for him.  <br />Be warned that if you dont like those long epics (this record is filled with them) and just want to head bang for a few minutes then this album is not for you and u'r better off buying the new Slayer record instead. Otherwise give this a couple of spins and i bet by the third time u say \\"man how did i miss this part in the song before\\" . The album is alike a multilayered cake and it gets better as you go deeper with it and find new things.  <br />I could do a track by track but you can find that in other reviews. This is just meant to be another metal fan's humble opinion. Maiden in the new millenium is sounding great with six men on top of their game with their ego's aside. I've heard 12 new albums in the past two weeks but this has become a staple in my daily diet. This album will be hailed as a new classic by the end of the year and Maiden will continue selling out arenas the world over and someday the people at Ozzfest will learn. UP THE IRONS!!!
B000002KKS|5.0|Indeed, at the dawn of the 80's Black Sabbath, fronted by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio, seemed to be hinting the answer to this eternal question by releasing \\"Heaven & Hell\\". After surviving a string of rough years and (at least) a couple of uneven albums, Sabbath parted ways with original singer Ozzy Osbourne.<br /><br />Let's stop being fanatics for a moment and analyze things in their true dimension, if you please: I love Ozzy, both with Sabbath and solo, but the guy IS NOT a singer! He got the gig in Sabbath because he was the only soul who could afford the P.A system and the microphone required to sing. This is not fiction, this is a historical fact, and Ozzy has openly admitted as much! Of course, that was part of his charm: he was a John Doe who became a big shot, and even though he couldn't sing, he was charismatic and lovable, and became a fundamental part of Sabbath's sound and success.<br /><br />For whatever reason(s), this success story came to an abrupt halt at the end of the \\"Never say Die\\" tour. Regardless of the circumstances, Ozzy was gone. Enter Ronnie James Dio: a TRUE vocalist. He came aboard and Sabbath regained their focus, which was sorely missing in albums such as \\"Sabbotage\\", \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and above all, \\"Never Say Die\\", which featured some great songs, but were for the most part a dissapointment for the fans AND the band alike (again, this is not fiction: all of the members of the band have said as much, including Ozzy).<br /><br />Oddly enough, I was \\"introduced\\" to this album and this lineup of Sabbath basically by accident: after discovering Sabbath via a Greatest Hits tape that I borrowed from a friend, I decided to get some of their music. Of course, that tape consisted of only Ozzy-era songs. I was always reading magazines, so I knew about Dio replacing Ozzy, but I didn't know Dio's music either! So, after searching high and low (at that time, it wasn't easy to get music from \\"old bands\\" in my country...), I got \\"Paranoid\\"; then, the only other record I could find was \\"Heaven and Hell\\". So, hesitantly, I got it and...my musical life was changed forever!!<br /><br />Ronnie James Dio became my biggest influence! He is, as far as I'm concerned, THE BEST hard rock vocalist EVER! I recognized the sound of the band, it was Sabbath for sure, but it was a different, leaner, meaner Sabbath! The funny thing is that the band decided not to go back to its traditional Ozzy-era sound, which relied heavily on epic songs such as \\"War Pigs\\", \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Black Sabbath\\", etc. Instead, Sabbath forged ahead in a new direction, which retained the identity traits of the band's sound, but also presented something new. The songs are more straight forward, in the vein of songs such as \\"Never Say Die\\" and \\"Rock n' Roll Doctor\\", as opposed to being the typical 7 minute riff-fest of yore.<br /><br />This is demonstrated with the opening track, the brutal \\"Neon Knights\\": the moment you hear that riff, YOU KNOW that Sabbath is back with a vengeance! This is also true for other awesome tracks such \\"Lady Evil\\", \\"Wishing Well\\", \\"Die Young\\" and \\"Walk Away\\", all of them gems in their own right. Then you have 3 more songs that, while retaining some of the grand epic overtones that Sabbath became famous for, clearly indicate an evolution towards new sonic territories: \\"Children of the Sea\\" is a moody trip that starts quietly and then slams you in the head; \\"Lonely is the Word\\" is the magnificent, epic showcase of Tony Iommi's playing that closes the album (somewhat reminiscent of songs like \\"Dirty Women\\"); and above all, the title track, \\"Heaven and Hell\\", a true rock masterpiece. I won't waste any time writing about it, as I believe that it is unnecessary, and no matter what I say, it wouldn't do justice to the song.<br /><br />It's very difficult for me to talk about favorite tracks, since I truly believe that each and every one is a highlight, but I would have to say that the ones that had the biggest impact on me at a first listen were \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Children of the Sea\\", \\"Lady Evil\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Wishing Well\\".<br /><br />So, essentially, this is it: \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is, without a doubt, one of the few undisputed rock jewels of all time. If you don't have it, for whatever reason, you don't know what you've been missing! Do yourself a favor: Forget about all the preconceptions you might have about this lineup of the band and get this CD. NOW!\\"Children of the Sea\\", \\"Lady Evil\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Wishing Well\\".     So, essentially, this is it: \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is, without a doubt, one of the few undisputed rock jewels of all time. If you don't have it, for whatever reason, you don't know what you've been missing! Do yourself a favor: Forget about all the preconceptions you might have about this lineup of the band and get this CD. NOW!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Simply put, this is the best movie of the year.  <br /> <br />If you're an Austen fanatic you might have some difficulties, but if you simply like entertaining movies, you will love this film.   <br /> <br />Great acting, great scenery, great story-what else could you want? <br /> <br />This is one definitely not to be missed!
B0000033P2|5.0|Possibly regarded as one of Emerson, Lake and Palmer's weaker albums, Trilogy is actually on the same level as the previous albums released by ELP.  The only difference is that, this time around, they are trying to make the music more accessible to the masses.  Does it work?  I think so, yeah.  The title song has some of the best musical parts I've ever heard, and the vocal melody is pretty decent as well.  That song, along with \\"the endless enigma (part one)\\" are really interesting compositions.  The musical ideas keep shifting around, and I like it a lot.  Even though I'm past my progressive rock phase, I STILL like coming back to this album and absorbing those keyboards and drum tricks.   <br /> <br />The whole album reminds me of church, and looking up at those colored windows (I don't know what you call those windows).  Many ELP songs remind me of either the Washington Monument, church or the Philadelphia mint.  Thomas Jefferson, too.   <br /> <br />At any rate, Trilogy once again proves that Emerson, Lake and Palmer are doing something completely different in the world of rock and roll.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is my favorite musical! Christine is an innocent and sweet orphan girl, who grew up in the Opera house in France, and became an Opera singer. Everyone is surprised, when she suddenly shines with her singing, when before she had just been part of the background. Christine's secret is that she has a mysterious teacher who taught her how to sing and use her voice. However Christine herself doesn't know who this teacher is, for she only hears his voice through the mirror. So she thinks that he is her &#34;angel of music&#34;. Then Raoul, her childhood friend and sweetheart, arrives at the opera house. So the story starts with a love triangle forming between Christine, her former childhood sweetheart Vicomte Raoul De Chagny, and the mysterious Phantom of the opera.<br /><br />The only flaw of this movie, is the phantom's singing voice which should've been better, but I know that he's an actor not a singer. In addition to the three main characters, there was an array of colorful supporting characters including madame Giry, and Carlotta (the comedic relief of the story). Overall this is a visually stunning movie, that mixes a suspenseful atmosphere with romance in the grand opera house.<br /><br />On a side note, I hope to one day see this very intriguing story presented as a movie that is not a musical!
B00004ZBLD|3.0|Vivaldi might have composed this oratorio with the celestial and the majestic in mind.<br /><br />Breaking with tradition, even the sinfonia is grandiose and pompous. Not surprisingly, it is borrowed from the first and second movements of concerto grosso con molti strumenti that portends something big is about to happen.<br /><br />Noteworthy are performances by Magdalena Kozena, and Marina Comparato.<br /><br />Juditha Triumphans treasures one of Vivaldi's most beautiful gems and presto arias di furie, Armatae Face Et Anguibus. Taking the task of singing this battle cry, Marina Comparato met and overcame the high standard previously set by Cecilia Bartoli. While Bartoli immersed her character in incontrollable rage and furious vengeance, Comparato turned a spin and sank hers in fear and despair at the death of Holofernes. Her melisma in singing the second vocal run of the aria conveys the vulnerability and anguish of Vagaus, the eunuch, at the death of his beloved master. Both voices and coloraturas are beautiful in conveying different psyches of the same character. What a difference an opera makes for Marina Comparato! Her brilliance was very visible in Il Giustino, but her virtuosity is established here.<br /><br />Magdalena Kozena simply sparkles in her role of Juditha, and singing of the virtuoso arias \\"Veni, Veni, Me Sequere Fidu\\", and \\"Agitata Infidu Flatu\\".
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Im convinced those who gave this a low rating dont have a romantic bone in their body and also dont care for sci-fi. This is a movie to enjoy and cherish. Many strings have to be pulled together to make this time gap work. One thing for sure wether you love this movie or not if you see it you will be talking about it as you leave the theater. I for one loved it and cant wait for it be released. Im surprised they didnt hold onto it longer at theaters. The proof of its popularity is at the end of its run when its shown at the dollar theaters. I saw it at least 3times at the cheap shows and every time it was packed to the gills and that is something you dont see at the dollar shows. I dont consider this a chick flick, you will have to see it to believe it. It has a sense of wonder ,has funny parts, serious and it ties it all together beautifully. My favorite show of the year and Im not alone in that fact. I saw it at least 4 times and kept telling myself this time the tears wont fall, but I just couldnt help myself. Love and hope are still strong.
0812550706|4.0|I found Ender's Game an exhilarating ride of a book, one that kept me pressing ahead chapter by chapter to see what would be revealed next, what would happen to Ender. Card does an excellent job setting a world that is normal enough to create empathy with the characters, yet strange enough to give a sense of unease to the reader. Immediately Ender became the character to cheer for because he is put through such abuse. His brother and sister initially seem to be opposites, but this changes as the story moves along.<br /><br /> Ender's sister, Valentine, vacillates morally throughout the book between the poles of \\"good\\" Ender and \\"bad\\" Peter, though these designations are much harder to deal with at the end when Peter is the herald of world peace and Ender is . . . not. I was unsatisfied with the development of Peter within the story (why did he change?) but Valentine was well fleshed out. Her ideas of emotional control over those around her are quite interesting and prove to be true.<br /><br /> The philosophy of Ender's Game is certainly attractive and in the same vein of much science fiction. Humanity can and will accomplish whatever it sets its mind to, including colonize the stars, as long as it can overcome the evil within itself. I found that Card does not overdo his insertion of philosophy into the novel at the cost of story. Masterfully, Card uses the standards of this genre to bring out some hard questions about evil's role within each human, ends justifying the means, and the decisions of popular opinion or secret power.<br /><br />Favorite quotes:<br /><br /> \\"Humanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us to be brilliant on its behalf. Survival first, then happiness as we can manage it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Welcome to the human race. Nobody controls his own life, Ender. The best you can do is choose to be controlled by good people, by people who love you.\\"
B000002UJQ|5.0|i remember when this came out. i think i was in 6th or 7th grade. radiohead was known to me by the two songs \\"high and dry\\" and \\"fake plastic trees\\" from their bends album, so the name wasn't totally lost in my memory. <br /> <br />i was young, but i take great pride in now knowing what kind of music i listened to back then and still do now. i was really into the \\"alternative\\" scene. bands like janes addiction, my bloody valentine, sonic youth, and smashing pumpkins ruled my world. (and i was so young!) <br /> <br />anyway, mtv use to show good music back then and i remember matt pennfield showing the video for \\"paranoid android\\" on 120 minutes and it intrigued me so much. it was kind of scary and deffinitely weird, but so chilling and atmospheric moody at the same time.  <br /> <br />i went to blockbuster music (remember those stores?!?!) and asked a clerk at the cd center if i could listen to the album. i remember him giving me the booklet and the couple of seconds it took before \\"airbag\\" came on. <br /> <br />i was blown away by the guitars and thom yorke's serene vocals and mellow tone. this music actually frightend me at first. i deffinitely wasn't ready for this album. <br /> <br />maybe a month or year or more later i eventually picked up the casette. (i didn't like cd's back then. too expensive for a kid with no job or money...) i remember taking it on a long drive through oklahoma and listening to the whole album and watching the landscape pass by and the open fields and blue skies. <br /> <br />radiohead for me has been a blessing in the form of music thats pure and so full of life that i can't help but be inspired everytime i listen to it. <br /> <br />i see the reviews made by the many fans, and the reviews by the people who can't get into it. i'm not mad or suprised by this. like i said earlier, i wasn't ready for this album when i first heard it. i stayed far away from it. i didn't even know how many good reviews it got and grammy's, because i never watched those things. (and still don't.) i came into it the first time because i remember liking the two songs from the bends and i thought that despite paranoid android, this album would be just like the other one. <br /> <br />it deffinitely takes alot to appreciate this opus. not one listen, but many. <br /> <br />my favorite songs are \\"airbag\\", \\"paranoid android\\", \\"subterranean homesick alien\\", \\"exit music (for a film)\\", \\"let down\\", and \\"karma police\\". basically the first six songs, but the rest are remarkable in their own right. i still try to figure out what makes that serreal humming sound during the end of karma police when thom is singing \\"i lost myself\\". it sounds like a violin mixed with the moans of people or something else completly. so cool. that's how complex this album is. you get something different everytime. <br /> <br />i'm 21 going on 22 and in my 4th year of college. radiohead are still with me and still one of my favorite bands.  <br /> <br />here's to you and them.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\\"I MAY BE PARANOID, BUT NOT AN ANDROID.\\"
B000HEYVD6|3.0|The Camel Club is a story of four people who witness the murder of a Secret Service agent and become targets themselves which ignites a national and international furor involving the FBI, CIA, NSA, the whole Intelligent Agency network. It also stands that the intrigue involved is somewhat in-house, which is reminiscent of Richard L. Jones' The Vatican Knights. <br /> <br /> <br />But The Camel Club does have flaws, as most novels do. But it doesn't detract that it is David Baldacci and is still a stellar writer. If you want a better read that taps into the in-house vein of intrigue, then read The Vatican Knights' by Richard L. Jones. <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|The other day I ran into a friend of mine at a gas station/video store. She was asking me whether a certain family movie was appropriate for her 3-4 year old daughter. I said yeah(even though it's not the greatest movie) and I got to thinking whether to suggest a Ghibli film. Problem is is that most of them aren't exactly \\"for all ages\\" since there's no dance-y numbers, obvious comic relief and easy to follow plots. So we have Spirited Away, which despite being an excellent film, might not be the first one you should use to test your kid(s) on Studio Ghibli films. <br /> <br />Chihiro and her parents are travelling when they come across a tunnel. They go through it to end up in an abandoned town which has a lot of food. Everyone except Chihiro eats only for them to turn into pigs. Eventually, she ends up in a bath house which caters to gods and they're not particularly interested in humans. She has to somehow manage to escape the bath house and get home with the help of some friends. <br /> <br />Now just to clarify what I meant in the first paragraph, this is a 2 hour film and its quite packed with information and characters. Not to mention it's pretty much a talky film with no songs, or gags and jokes a la Shrek or even Toy Story. In many ways, you can consider this more a film for 8-13 year olds than 3-4. They'd probably like how colorful it is but this isn't like Dora the Explorer or Spongebob where the accessibility for a child is instant. As for the scary scenes mentioned, it's not really a big deal, depending on their tolerance. Let's put it this way: did they survive the dwarves hunting the Witch in Snow White or the Ursula fight in Little Mermaid? Yes? Then they'll handle it. <br /> <br />There's plenty to like here. First, the animation is of course great, largely hand-drawn which is certainly even more impressive watching it. And like Miyazaki characters, there's no black and white/good and evil characters which makes them all the more human and likable.Although some might not like Yubaba which qualifies has one of the more instantly unlikable characters. The voice acting like the other dubs is likable but I usually click the Japanese option right away. Not that I'm against English dubs, in fact that's how I watched Fullmetal Alchemist, it's just I tend to prefer the original. <br /> <br />What should you watch first? Well Totoro is probably likely as well as Kiki's Delivery Service but oddly, the most kid friendly is probably the Cat Returns since there's very little scary parts and it's not plot-heavy. But Spirited Away is rightly an animated classic you should watch.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|I have all Krall's recordings - my favorites being \\"Love Scenes, the Look of Love,\\" and the album which preceeded this one (the title eludes me at the moment)- but this album is sad.  The vocals aren't up to par and the songs chosen have trite lyrics.  The musicianship isn't bad - but there is a formulatic approach that leaves the songs cold and uninspired.  There is no life in this album.  A dud... Disappointing - I was excited to here more Krall.  Shamefully, I couldn't even find one song (save maybe \\"how insensitive\\") that I really liked...
B000GGSMF8|4.0|Not the same \\"wow\\" as the first album (as it came out of left field), but definitely not a victim of the sophomore jinx either. In regards the song selections, Punk Music had its time & place, and to hear these songs (which probably are familiary anyone who has listened to popular music from the early 80s onward) done differently is interesting, worthy of any true music fans attention (I would have loved to hear Nouvelle Vague do a version of The Clash's \\"Rock The Cassbah.\\"<br /><br />Nouvelle Vague's artistic angle reminds me of jazz, in that the \\"studio\\" or album version was just the blueprint, the springboard, and what the musicians do on stage can be markedly different. So-called pop music (whether it's punk, hiphop, bubblegum, ska, classic rock) could all be reinterpretted (like this straight raggae disc of Police songs that I heard -- it's those lyrics, but done with a Trenchtown groove) -- and anyone who tells you it can't or it shouldn't is being closed minded.<br /><br />And speakig of Sting, he does a lot of reinterpreting of his music (like on his Bring on the Night CD or the MTV Unplugged session) -- it makes it that much richer. Remember so-called symphonic classical music was improvised upon in its day.
B000002HH2|5.0|In 1995, Bjork released her second album entitled POST. This album sounds a lot like that of her first album, but this album seems to be a little more intense than that of the first album. Frankly, POST is actually even better than DEBUT, and DEBUT was amazing to begin with. I can understand why this album sounds a lot better than the first, for Bjork now has experience in coming up with new sounds, as well as the fact that she wrote Madonna's hit single, \\"Bedtime Story\\", for Madonna's 1994 album, BEDTIME STORIES. <br /> <br />ARMY OF ME <br />  The first single from the album. This song is absolutely incredible, and the video is spectacular. A great song. <br /> <br />HYPER-BALLAD <br />  The second single from the album. This is, yet, another amazing track. This is a song, just like \\"Army Of Me\\", that I can listen to over and over. <br /> <br />THE MODERN THINGS <br />  Great track. <br /> <br />IT'S OH SO QUIET <br />  The third single from the album. This is a great track. It sounds like it could be well-crafted into a Broadway Musical, like \\"Rent\\", or something. <br /> <br />ENJOY <br />  Great track. <br /> <br />YOU'VE BEEN FLIRTING AGAIN <br />  Great. <br /> <br />ISOBEL <br />  The fourth single from the album. Another great track. <br /> <br />POSSIBLE MAYBE <br />  The fifth single from the album. Great track, and great video. <br /> <br />I MISS YOU <br />  The sixth & final single from the album. Great track. <br /> <br />COVER ME <br />  Great track. <br /> <br />HEADPHONES <br />  Not bad, but it could have been a lot better than this. <br /> <br />    This album is truly amazing, and it definitely informs us that Bjork has a lot of talent and creativity. Yeah, I'll admit that she's definitely out there, but that's what I like about her: She's very strange, but she's extremely theatrical and I've always liked theatrical performing artists (Madonna, Cher, Marilyn Manson, to name a few). Great album.
B000H305U0|4.0|1. FutureSex/LoveSound- Ahh, the opening track to the CD. It also shares the same name as the Album itself. The track itself isn't JT's best work and personally I don't like it so much. However, it gives off a retro vibe and that trademarked falsetto of JTs isn't so apparent in the track. Still reminscent of \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\". 7/10  <br /> <br />2. SexyBack- The first single that helped JT bring \\"SexyBack\\". The problem is, Sexy never left the building. Great beat. Horrible repetition. Compared to the first single off of Justified, this doesn't even come close. Either you hate it or love it. However, I like the beat but the repetition and subject matter is somewhat lackluster. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. SexyLadies/ Let Me Talk To You Prelude- Let me make a note by saying that on FutureSex/LoveSounds, JT choose a few tracks to be \\"transitional pieces.\\" He attaches preludes and interludes to the end of full songs. Ergo, this makes a couple tracks in excess of 7 mins or more. He does it first on this track. When I heard this song I got a Prince-esque feel plus the retro vibe yet again with a little funk. The Prelude \\"Let Me Talk To You\\" is absoultely a great prelude to the next track. 7/10 <br /> <br />4. My Love- Trademark Timbaland production. First thing that people keep saying is that \\"This reminds me of Aaliyah\\". Classic Timbaland sound and the sound that makes Timbaland \\"Timbo\\". A love song mixed with an amazing beat. Good Music is Good Music. Confirmed to be the next single  9/10 <br /> <br />5. LoveStoned/I Think She Knows Interlude- Personally, one of my most favorite tracks on the album. Very original since it was born due to the fact that JT was just randomly beatboxing the beat before the song actually was born. Has many remnants of Prince's Controversy and you gotta love the lyrics. Another 7 min song that changes halfway into the interlude. Interlude is clearly JT singing over a Coldplay song. Classic. 10/10 <br /> <br />6.What Goes Around.../...ComesAround Interlude- Can someone say Cry Me a River Part II? I don't care what JT says that this song isn't about his famous ex-girlfriend. It has to be since no one can sing about the same subject matter twice in two consequetive albums. Lyrics are great if your girlfriend cheated on you and shows you that the love of your life will always be with you someway. For JT, its with his songs. Starts out with a sitar and sounds like an Indian song the first few 13 or so seconds then the beat kicks in. Lyrics are great. The Interlude is pretty good because it makes JT sound kinda pissed but in a good way. However, it will NEVER be Cry Me a River. Sorry JT, at least you tried. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />7. Chop Me Up (ft Three Six Mafia, Timbaland)- Oh God. JT's take on southern hip-hop. JT is trying to fit in with the hip-hop crowd a little too hard. Chop Me Up is just showing that he's thinking about other demographics instead of the teeny bopper girls. I can see this becoming mainstream. 6/10 <br /> <br />8. Damn Girl (ft Will.I.Am from the Black Eyed Peas)- Okay, James Brown/Al Green. Ooops, i forgot, this is a Justin Timberlake CD. This is clearly a beat that the Black Eyed Peas would use circa  ELEPHUNK. Then we have JT singing as if he's James Brown then we get Will.I.Am rapping with a stuttering problem. Could have been better. 6/10 <br /> <br />9. SummerLove/Set the Mood Prelude- Heavy Timbaland production is noticed when I heard this song. This could have been on Justified. Has an OFF THE WALL feel to it. The prelude turns into a Ginuwine song. Production is top-notch when the prelude kicks in. Look up Ginuwine for more of this kind of music. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Until The End of Time (ft The Benjamin Wright Orchestra)- Personally, I love this song cause I'm down with the whole slow R&B beats with cheesy lyrics. I know a lot of people who hate this type of song but ehh. Production is top notch considering the fact that JT brought in a live orchestra to record the song.Ladies will love it. 9/10 <br /> <br />11. Losing My Way- This song was born after JT watched a true life story of a Drug Addict who had a family, job and everything. Until crystal meth kicked in. Story telling song that can get to you. Classic JT experimenting. 8/10 <br /> <br />12. (Another Song) All Over Again- The only Rick Rubin produced song. Rick Rubin was the guy who mixed up Run DMC and Aerosmith for \\"Walk This Way\\" and most recently helped Jay-Z release his \\"last single\\" with 99 problems since he produced that joint. Has an alternative type feel to it. Completely out of place on FutureSex/LoveSounds. I give him props for going somewhere beyond the regular white picket fence. 9/10 <br /> <br />Overall, FutureSex/LoveSounds is NO Justified. Once you get over that fact, you'll eventually love this CD. The Neptunes are missing altogether. That was a BIG mistake in my opinion since they produced 75% of the last CD. Due to record label disputes, Timbaland was a great choice since the Neptunes could not participate. Justified was completely Neptunes time to shine since both them and JT won grammys for there work on Justified. JT was having fun with this CD and I think people will like the next couple of singles that JIVE will put out. He apparently comes as a guilty pleasure to A lot of people still(including me) and isn't as credible as Micheal Jackson was when Jackson released Off the Wall. If Justified was a modern update to \\"Off the Wall\\" then FutureSex/LoveSounds is a modern update to Prince's Purple Rain album. I'm still waiting for JT to do a modern take on \\"Thriller\\". Only then will JT emerge as the \\"Prince of Pop\\". The album hits high though after it is given a chance. A must try. <br />
B000002HPV|5.0|In 1997, Bjork released her fourth album entitled, HOMOGENIC. The title sure sounds weird, whereas the front album cover will have you looking at, while saying to yourself, \\"What the Hell is the matter with her?\\" But the album is brilliantly put together. Everything about it, the writing, the producing, the lyrics, the sound, the whole ancelotta, is worth the time, the money, and your listening pleasure. <br /> <br />HUNTER <br />  The second single from the album. Great song, complete with a great music video. <br /> <br />JOGA <br />  The fourth single from the album. Awesome tune. <br /> <br />UNRAVEL <br />  The third single from the album. Great song. <br /> <br />BACHELORETTE <br />  The first single from the album. This is a classic song, and it is one of my all-time favorite Bjork songs. <br /> <br />ALL NEON LIKE <br />  Great track. <br /> <br />5 YEARS <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />IMMATURE <br />  Great track. Really describes how most people in this world are \\"Immature\\". <br /> <br />ALARM CALL <br />  The fifth single from the album. I can't believe she actally used the \\"F\\" word in this song. I think she used it because she is still fuming at that reporter that Bjork kicked the crap out of. Just kidding. Great song. <br /> <br />PLUTO <br />  The sixth single from the album. Great song. <br /> <br />ALL IS FULL OF LOVE <br />  The seventh & final single from the album. This album version is not as good as I had hope it would be, but the single/video version is simply amazing. The reason why I like the single/video version better than this album version is simply because the single/video version was given a drum beat, as well as having the sound more efficiently like a Bjork track. The video is simply amazing, and the song is my all-time favorite Bjork song. <br /> <br />    This is a great album, and it is my all-time favorite Bjork album, with POST right behind it. All Bjork fans must already have this album. If not, then buy this album. Trustme, this album is purely amazing.
6305922756|5.0|How to be a part of real Rock History without being a musician, singer, producer or someone in the music business? Answer: Make a movie as this one. Almost every serious Rock fan and rock star must have seen this movie or if they haven't, they had better see it before they go out and give another interview. Believe me, there are bands and performers who still talk and give interviews like Spinal Tap did in this movie. This movie is made for these guys. Like me, if you have watched countless interviews of rockstars, popstars and movie stars you cannot do without this classic. The Lead guitarist was my favourite. I could give him an Oscar for his brilliant performance. If Jimmy Page used a bow on his guitar you must wait and see what the lead guitarist of  Spinal Tap does. <br /> <br />These guys literally become Gods by the way they poke fun at Rockstars and their mannerisms particularly when it comes to giving interviews and playing live. In fact this movie is so well made that it puts to shame serious rockumentaries made for real rockstars and bands.  <br /> <br />One of the most famous lines from the movie apart from \\"This one goes to 11\\" is when the band is asked about one of their deceased members for which the band mates tell the interviewer (played by the director Rob Reiner himself) that the bandmate died of choking on vomit but they didn't know whose vomit!  Hilarious and highly entertaining you'll love this DVD with tons of goodies which are worth the price of the DVD alone. There is so much extra footage on the DVD that is seems like Spinal Tap 2.   <br /> <br />The extras are as good as the original movie. I couldn't stop laughing when the band goes to the zoo and near the chimps cage when they are talking their usual ridiculous lines they say things like \\"'..chimps can't talk but can use computers..\\" and stuff. You wonder how brilliantly the actors have come together to pull off something like this.    <br /> <br />Neatly packaged even the liner notes are funny. Almost every move made and every line spoken is worth being labelled funny. One of the songs even caught my attention though the lyrics were insane. <br /> <br />A classic you cannot afford to miss.
B00005UEAR|4.0|The first disc of Six Degrees is absolutely fantastic, featuring such gems as The Glass Prison, Blind Faith, and Disappear. The only track that's sub-par is \\"The Great Debate.\\" But perhaps I'm biased about that, being an agnostic--DT has always had some christian influences in some of their songs, but TGD just takes it a little too far.  <br /> <br />As far as the second disc goes...It's a spectacular effort, and DT should be applauded for it. However, it falls a little short. \\"The War Inside My Head,\\" \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\", and \\"Solitary Shell\\" are ASTOUNDING tracks, but the rest are just flat, especially Goodnight Kiss.  <br /> <br />I would recomment passing this album over for now if you haven't yet bought such gems as Scenes From a Memory, Awake, and Octavarium.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I traveled one hundred miles to see this film at the Palm Springs Film Festival back in January and it was worth every cent of my gas. Beautiful cinematography, great acting, and a perfect interpretation of the original beouwulf poem. A must see film!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This album blew me away. John Mayer has truly transitioned from a \\"pop boy\\" into a \\"blues man\\". He tackles life/political issues, heartbreak and hope all in one album. This album is a MUST HAVE FOR ANY JM FAN and a MUST CHECK OUT for anyone who is curious.<br /><br />5 stars, I love it!
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I saw this film at the Sarasota Film Festival in Florida and was fortunate enough to have the director there as well. This movie has wonderful landscapes, a great story and wonderful acting. It's worth every $
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Way better than the old version!<br /><br />The old version is boring for the first half hour or so... dull, unimaginative, not alot going on.<br /><br />This version is fantastic beginning to end!<br /><br />Tim Burton & Johnny Depp make the best movies!<br /><br />I've seen it about ten times & never get bored!<br /><br />The second disc has great games on it my kids love playing!<br /><br />There is one where you get to make up gross candy recipes and feed them to the oompa loompa!<br /><br />Tons of fun for the whole family!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I loved it. <br /> <br />It's not just an action movie (though the action scenes are pretty decent). The plot is political and you could apply the same ideas to our current world. <br /> <br />If you care about dialogs, you'll love this movie. It's one of those movies that it's much more than just fights and killings. The main character was quite interesting (V)... His mask freaked me out a bit, but I got used to it after a bit. <br /> <br />If you're looking for an Oscar winner, look someplace else, but if you want a solid entertainment for 2 hours, get this movie. <br />
0060763280|2.0|I bought this book and the audio version too. The CD is difficult to understand with the sound fading in and out, up and down. Maybe T. Harv is not the right man for the job. His is not a smooth voice. There is an obvious lack of compression on his voice that is a bit distracting. Perhaps, reading the book first, then listening to the tape if you want reiteration, would help to understand Eker's message. The book does an excellent job of selling his seminars too. The first one is, of course, free. After that it can get quite expensive. I took two and decided to also take Eker's advice and stop throwing good money after bad.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This CD is an absolute blast to listen to. Not only is each and every one of the songs great, this CD also includes some of the onstage interaction between Cash, his band, and his audience that really livens things up. And this CD has very, very good sound that has been digitally remastered for the best quality of this recording to date. Crank up the volume on a good sound system and you can hear the prisoners shout all kinds of funny stuff. All in all, a very good portrait of a great entertainer.
B000F3A7LE|5.0|OK. This is really one of ym favourite albums ever. Fripss has never been in better form before or after. From the recordings of found dialogue to the music this is simply mind-blowing. If you also thought it was good before...this is even better. The recording quality is simply among the ebst you will hear for such a thing. This was recorded almost 20 years ago if I am not wrong. It contains songs such as the scorching punky \\"Light me up I'm a cigarette\\" to the usual Crimson-like guitar work-outs as well as some very romantic songs...The best track remains Exposure, of course, and wait till you hear the unreleased version of it at the end of the second CD, you will cry with joy.  Throw away all your CD's and keep only this one (OK and a few others)
B0000549B0|5.0|For haven's sake, let him be \\"crazy\\" and pleasant, don't make him \\"perfectly normal\\" and nasty!      I was led to believe that Harvey is a movie  about a drunk who sees a hallucination due to his excesses drinking. As a matter of  fact that is  not the case. Elwood P. Dowd (Jimmy Stewart) is a carefree philanthropist. His big smile is contagious and his selflessness and generosity are adorable. To him, every day is beautiful and every fellow human is important.  If you are fortunate to meet Elwood,  he'd buy you a drink or two and invite you for dinner at his home. No matter what the circumstances, at least he'll give you one of his cards (so you can always reach him) and a warm  compliment, and a peace of his golden heart.     Elwood shares his home with his sister Veta Louise (Josephine Hull), her daughter and Harvey, 6-foot tall rabbit, that only he can see. Harvey is Elwood's best friend and constant companion. Unfortunately, Elwood's obsession with his imaginary friend interferes with Veta's plans to marry off her daughter and she decides to put him in a mental hospital. Then a hilarious mix up occurs and Veta finds herself committed instead.  It is now up to Elwood and Harvey to sort the mess out and Veta needs to make a decision -does she want her brother to change and become \\"normal and nasty\\" or does she prefer him the way he is, loving, caring and generous. And what about Harvey? Well, he is part of the dilemma.    There are twists and turns in this much loved classic. Although a comedy, there is a lot of drama and wisdom in it and an important message delivered with refreshing sense of humour. The performances are brilliant, all of the cast play their hearts out. Josephine Hull is fantastic and she rightly deserves her Oscar for this performance but the show belongs to the ever-captivating Jimmy Stewart, who in my opinion was robbed again on the Academy Awards night. Lets not forget Harvey, he is brilliant too. If you've had trouble seeing him throughoutthe show, you can't miss him at the end. Trust me, he was there and I saw him, 6'8 foot tall, white rabbit! He will take you to a better world, where all days are beautiful and everybody is important and appreciated.     The DVD transfer is good quality with clear sound and picture in 4:3 ratio. There is a theatrical trailer and a special introduction by Jimmy Stewart, which was recorded in 1990. Harvey is a fabulous movie, one that simply  cannot be made nowadays.  The screen play is based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Mary Chase and with one of Jimmy Stewart's finest performances, it is a jewel to be enjoyed and treasured forever!
B001S86J2Q|1.0|When Grease was re-released to theaters in 1998, Paramount inexplicably remixed the soundtrack. There seems to be no good reason for this, but it was during a time when \\"special edition\\" releases were constantly messing with the original version of films. Unfortunately, there are numerous errors and changes in the remix. Some are downright inexcusable, like percussion and background vocals in the wrong place, bad music edits and even background vocals out of sync during You're the One That I Want. Foley and dialog balances are off throughout. It's a mess.<br /><br />Despite the fact that fans have been complaining for years, Paramount included only this remix on the 2 DVD versions they released. I had assumed they would finally include the original soundtrack on the blu ray, but they are STILL only using the botched remix. This is unbelievable. Including the far superior original soundtrack would cost them virtually nothing, and yet they continue to disrespect a popular classic movie and it fans, despite being repeatedly made aware of the problem. I bought the first 2 DVD editions, but refuse to buy a blu ray until they fix the soundtrack.<br /><br />The only way to hear the original, correct soundtrack is on pre-1998 VHS and laserdisc copies. I guess ignorance is bliss, and if you don't know what you are missing it won't bother you, but I can't stand to watch the movie with the remix.
B000002KBU|5.0|Captivating. There are few artists that can acheive that description. At the risk of sounding cliche, this album is (actually) a timeless masterpiece. Both melodies and lyrics are at a constant musical apex in many tracks like \\"River\\", \\"California\\", and my personal favorite, \\"All I Want\\". Just buy this album now and forget the possibility of buyers regret. If you don't like it right away, give it a few more tries. Like all good art, you will understand and experience it fully during a resonating mood. This is the paradigm of music. If you'll notice that there are few if any similar items, it's because nothing quite compares.   Also, don't let \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" represent Joni Mitchell. It doesn't do her justice.
B000FS9FCG|2.0|I know I'm going to get mass bad votes on my review, but I wanted to put in my 2 cents. <br /> <br />As far as the movie goes, the visuals and acting were pretty good.  Portman was believable in her emotion, and Weaving was great at portraying emotion even with his face concealed by a mask.  But for me, that's where it ends.  <br /> <br />I do not understand the opinion of who say this movie is 'thought-provoking' or 'deep' in any sense.  It has been pointed out in previous reviews, that right-wingers are the only ones finding any thing wrong with this movie, because it offends their political views.  Now, I'm not a conservative, but could it also be said that left-wing people find it enjoyable because it somehow supports their beliefs?   <br />First of all, the 'hero' wears the mask of a religious extremist himself.  How ironic is that?  A brief history lesson of Guy Fawkes will tell you that he tried to blow up the House of Lords not to gain 'freedom' for the masses, but because Fawkes was a Catholic and James I was a Protestant.   <br />So V tries to free everyone through violence, and in the end, he leaves everyone else to clean up the mess and fill the power vacuum that is left behind.  Just like a terrorist.  Create mayhem and destruction for thier own views, and leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces and move on.  This movie was juvenile in its themes and ideas, most notably that the UK would ever be ruled by a Christian regime.  I'll only say that if you want to see a good movie about authoritarian rule without all the blatant political propaganda, go rent Equilibrium.  That's a 4-5 star movie.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I must admit, that prior to this album, I wasn't a fan of Mayer other than liking his music but didn't own a record of his.  For some reason, after reading the other reviews upon the release date of Continuum, I took you all at heart and believed that my fellow listeners and critics wouldn't let me down.  Well, you didn't and what a great album this is.  From the beginning to the end, you find yourself mesmerized by the sound of both blues, jazz,and adult contemporary combined.  It needs to be put on repeat and with a great atmosphere, life just doesn't get any better.   <br />Todd Atchison <br />Lafayette, LA
B000DN6ZGC|3.0|Thanks to the newest musical contribution from the UK , we now have a revamped and improved version of Nelly Fertardo. Not to say that Corrine Bailey Rae's self titled cd is a Nelly rip off. However , she certainly sounds alot like Nelly.I have read where this young artist is reminicent of Billy Holiday and has the spirit of some of the old school blues singers of the past. However , I found this to be entirely false. Corrinne Bailey,sounds nothing like any of the great blues singers from the past. Whereas , she certainly has better singing ability than her American twin ( Nelly Fertardo ) , she's no \\" Lady Day \\". When I heard the first cut off of this cd , I thought of Nelly and Eryka Badu.  But if I put those resemblances out of my mind , I found this cd to be a worthwhile listen. Some of the songs are very well produced and the vocals are easy on the ears. This artist certainly has talent and has a very dynamic production team behind her. Some of the songs could get American airplay on the radio. However , the remaining music reminds me of the independent flavor of a Jonathon Butler album.I give this cd a 3 star rating because I think for a debut cd , Corrine Bailey Rae has done<br /><br />an absolutely fabulous job. I also think that if she's this good now , she'll only get better with time. I'd like to enjoy that ride with her and am recommending this cd , to you. It's not for a partying Saturday night at the club. But if you're cleaning the house , driving in your car , or just want to unwind after work , this is the cd to buy. My favorite cuts off of this album are \\" Butterfly \\" and \\" Trouble Sleeping \\".
B000BT97AO|5.0|I have trouble saying how much I enjoyed this movie.  The plot was well worn, but it didn't feel staid or plodding.  Visually, the movie is simply stunning.  Absolutely some of the best visuals I have seen in years.  The Jim Henson company outdid themselves this time.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Alas, Diana has come home to her jazz roots. This album is highly recommended to jazz fans who love big band and quartet arrangements. This is Diana's best album by far. Diana's sultry singing voice oozes with infectious sex appeal. The Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra's musical instruments make this album sound grand and beautifully sound. Diana is surely back.
0312330537|5.0|This novel was wonderful...I didn't want to put it down and was truly sad when it came to an end.<br /><br />I met someone recently from India who met GDR through a friend and had coffee with him. They discussed the book and GDR maintains that the story is true. Not that I doubted it but i guess it made it even more real.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - one of the best in a very long time!
B000G03Q2S|5.0|How many times is this album gonna be re-released?  As far as the DVD, the interviews were edited, and most of the content is missing.  Also, the HOME IMPROVEMENT on Mike's hat was fazed out, among other things.  I love Pet Sounds as much as the next guy, but if they're gonna keep re-releasing it, include the other tracks (Unreleased Backgrounds, Trombone Dixie).  I have so many copies of Pet Sounds right now, not only the new one, but the 1990 release, the boxed set, Brian's live version on CD & DVD, and the Beach Boys DVD released a few years back.  How about a legal copy of the original SMILE, or the Landlocked tracks (Celebrate The News, Breakaway...) actually released on the album they were supposed to appear on.  There is so much stuff not available, but they keep re-releasing Pet Sounds.
B000GFLKF8|2.0|Firstly , this film is predictable and unenjoyable. There's no surprise ending and there's nothing fascinating about this so-called \\" thriller\\". With that said , I am about to vent because this was an unexpected lemon. Secondly, I am a huge Denzel Washington fan and a huge Spike Lee fan. I've always enjoyed Willem Defoe , Christopher Plummer , and Jody Foster. All of these talents are immeasurable and can do wonders with good material. Problem with Spike Lee's latest film, about a New York city crisis negotiator who is dealing with a bank robbery and hostage situation, entitled  \\" Inside Man \\" , is that this material isn't even good enough to be called mediocre. Certainly the actors have done what they could with what they had to work with. It's painful to see talented actors reaching for more emotion to get anything out of a boring scene. Ultimately , I believe that this is a project that takes the normally focused Spike Lee , out of his genre and element. With hits like \\"School Daze\\" , \\"Jungle Fever\\" , \\"Do The Right Thing\\" , and \\"Malcom X \\" , Lee , burst onto the film scene with a visionary skill that noone could imitate. However , \\" Inside Man\\" just played out like a bad melodramatic soap opera. This film is exempliary of poor filmaking choices. Spike Lee is a visionary director with a focal point in all of his films. Without a focus , everything else is blurry nonsense. Not even the acting strengths of Denzel Washington  and the stellar cast can save this lemon , of a film. Then again, if Spike Lee intended on filming a movie and proving that he can also direct forgettable and generic productions , he's done a fabulous job. However , Spike Lee is better and smarter than \\" Inside Man \\". Hopefully , he'll re-recognized the power of his gift and I look forward to seeing his upcoming HBO documentary, about the devastating issues in New Orleans, entitled , \\" When the Levees Broke \\". The best aspect of this DVD is the behind-the-scenes footage. The interview between Denzel Washington and Spike Lee is revealing and provides glimses of their admiration for one another and their genuine friendship. Too bad this segment lasts for less than ten minutes. Lesson to learn ? Yes , beware of any film that has alot of big named actors on the cover. The producers do this to enduce the viewer to buy it because the cover is appealing. Usually to hide the stench inside. In this case , a useless and boring film. Bottom line , if you're a fan of anyone connected to this film.....be afraid.

B000HCO840|5.0|This movie stands apart from the first two - different directors, different visions.  While Singer's approach was darker, Ratner goes for a bit of both worlds.  Special effects are fantastic.  There are scenes where you will laugh at loud, something that was missing from the first two.  This movie was fun and didn't feel 20 minutes too long like the first two.  Now don't get me wrong...I enjoyed the first two.  It's just that this one was more appealing to me.  For those who worship the first 2 films, you will probably not like this as much.<br /><br />This movie does have its flaws, though.  Nightcrawler is almost fully absent in this movie, which was a shame because I enjoyed him in the 2nd movie.  Also, Archangel was underutilized (I think it's hard to fit everybody since there are so many characters and they don't want the movie to drag).  I also wished that Gambit would make an appearance in the X-men movies (he was always my favorite).  Ever since watching LOST, I thought that Josh Holloway (Sawyer) would make a good Gambit and then read that he was going to be Gambit (but something happened where they didn't write Gambit in, for whatever reason).<br /><br />Oh, and the scene where Wolverine gets shot by the arrow, he heals himself but his shirt no longer has the hole from the arrow...I guess his shirt is self healing as well!<br /><br />All in all, this movie was well worth watching (and watching again).  Hopefully there will be more X-men movies in the future.
B000H305U0|4.0|In the grand order of things, this is not a great album. When understood as a pop album, however, I applaud Timbaland for introducing sounds that its target demographic doesn't get much exposure to. I'm talking about the electronica elements. And when Timberlake (not Timbaland) starts channeling Micheal Jackson, and in comes the lean, diving and bouncing beats known in R&B; and in comes the synth hits known so well in electronica, they combine to form a propulsive Voltron of catchiness.<br /><br />It's too bad that Timberlake is better at Michael Jackson than he is at Timberlake. When he starts crooning sweet nothings like a teenage troubadour, things go downhill rapidly. As another reviewer said, the beats and the melodies are inspired, but don't listen too closely to Timberlake's increasingly silly and forgettable love letters to the microphone. I understand he wants to be an \\"artist,\\" but I think he's a far better singer than lyricist.<br /><br />Even at his best, Future Sex is most notable for its production wizardry. I think Justin has the personality to support the beats, but he's still writing for a mainstream pop album. And although he's a good-looking fella, his voice isn't masculine enough to convince me that he has every father in the nation hiding their daughters in the basement. He can sound naughty, but he can't manage the slight menace that says \\"sexy.\\"<br /><br />Such is the potential downfall of leading a charmed life; you just can't dig deep and say a lot meaningful things, because you haven't had a lot of \\"meaningful\\" experiences. He talks your ear off about girlfriends, breakups, being heartbroken -- it makes me say, \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've all been down that street before, Justin.\\" Of course, that's what makes this a pop album, so I can't really knock him for just being who he is. On the other hand, the level and approach of the production indicates that he wants to be taken seriously, rather than just entertain. Well, JT, if you want to be taken seriously, say something that sticks in my head after the last track has ended. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but don't bring your knives to a gun fight, you know?<br /><br />Still, the soundscape on Future Sex manages, just barely, to overcome his weaknesses. In fact, it makes me want to pick up whatever album is next on Timbaland's list.be taken seriously, say something that sticks in my head after the last track has ended.

006056251X|4.0|The second book in Lisa Kleypas' Wallflower series, It Happened One Autumn, ended with shy, virginal Evangeline Jenner making an outrageous proposal to infamous rake and seducer of innocents, Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent.  To escape her overbearing and abusive relatives, Evie asked Sebastian to join her in a marriage of convenience that would be mutually beneficial; the marriage would protect her from her relatives' plotting while her dowry and inheritance would revive his dwindling fortune.  So the two embark on what is supposed to be a marriage in name only. Evie agrees to sleep with Sebastian once, to make the marriage legal, but never again so as not to lose her heart to him.  They run off to Gretna Green to begin a life as husband and wife.<br /><br />This was by far my favorite book in the Wallflower series.  Kleypas found a formula that works this time and I actually enjoyed both the hero and the heroine.  Usually in Regency romances it's one or the other for me.  Sebastian adhered perfectly to the adage that reformed rakes make the best husbands with his constant doting on Evie, brash fits of jealousy, and reluctance to surrender his heart.  And once Evie managed to climb out of her fearful shell and take back control of her life, she became a new, stronger person who was a joy to read about.  I was angry when this book ended since it was in such stark contrast to the disappointing story in It Happened One Autumn.  I can only hope that the final book in the Wallflower series, Scandal in Spring, can keep up the momentum that this book has created for the series.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Last Christmas my grandmother sent me some money, and this album is one of the things I bought.  Having had no exposure to NIN (except through music videos), I was taken aback by my immediate liking of this particular work.  I've since obtained a copy of \\"The Downward Spiral\\", and while I find it to be fascinating--not to mention obnoxious at times--I have to admit that, at age 41, I prefer \\"With Teeth\\", which is more advanced both lyrically and musically.  Mr. Reznor's prodigious anger has thankfully been somewhat tempered by his new-found penchant for intelligent reflection and, yes, emotional growth. That's not to say that he's gotten boring.  His innate talent precludes that.  There are some genuinely beautiful melodies here to go along with his improved singing voice, but--not to worry--there's also the residual self-hatred, self-absorption, and loathing for existence shared by all nihilists.  I like to think that I have a little man that lives inside of me.  His name is Trent Reznor.
0385336691|4.0|Lee Child is one of my favorite authors, hands down.  The Jack Reacher series is in my opinion the best series out there.  10 books strong and I don't want it to end.  It's the only series that begs for more once the last sentence is read.  Whereas the Alex Cross series by James Patterson began to fizzle after 5 books or so, Lee Child's writing is getting stronger and Jack Reacher more likable each time.  And that says a lot about an author.  To keep things fresh (truly, this should have gotten stale a long time ago) shows the imagination and creativity of Child.  But I have loved every book.<br /><br />This book was no exception.  From the get-go, you are hooked.  You will ask all sorts of questions about the kidnapping of a man's wife and daughter.  And Reacher, who is rarely wrong, shows that he may be temporarily wrong in the short run, but in the long run you know he will see the big picture.  This is an easy read, entertaining, and you'll get through it quickly.<br /><br />The first 7 Lee Child books left me totally stumped as to what was going to happen.  However, with the last three (starting with \\"The Enemy\\"), I have been able to deduce what was going to happen before Reacher found out.  Even though I figured it out early , though, the way Child lays out the scenarios and Reacher's thought processes are amazing and still kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I am greatly looking forward to Book 11 and am hoping that Child keeps up the great quality of the best series on the market.  Oh and Jack...what time is it?
B00003W8NM|5.0|It took me a while to get around to it but I finally gave it a chance. Trailers and clips made FIGHT CLUB look like a film glorifying silly WWE-style backyard brawls.<br /><br />The opening credits zoom out of Ed Norton's body and up a pistol held by Tyler Durden (Pitt).  Norton narrates the story to bring the viewer up to speed.<br /><br />His character is firmly enmeshed as a dull, desensitized slave toiling as a claims adjuster, an easy, well-paid desk job. He rents a high-rise apartment bloated with designer furniture, name brand clothes, name brand food...<br /><br />He's addicted to and comforted by male support groups. Then, one day, a woman (Helena Bonham Carter) ups and decides to sit in.<br /><br />A chance meeting with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) prods Norton's character to blow up his safe, materialistic life and take residence in a dump on the edge of town. He and Tyler (Pitt) form a support group called FIGHT CLUB. Therapy sessions include gladiator tournaments designed to amp up aggression. Participants emerge pulpy but there are no losers. They are hirelings and chumps in the outside world. The brutish matches empower them. Groups prior to FIGHT CLUB reinforced their weakness, like E.D (erectile dysfunction. Ironically, a member of this group, a steroid abuser, has breasts). Finally they had a club no woman would join, a real MEN'S club.<br /><br />FIGHT CLUB is stunning and ultra-violent and open to interpretation including society's addiction to icons. As Tyler Durden (Pitt's character) says: \\"The things you own end up owning you.\\" The solution, he believes, is to fight and give up being perfect. Bruises, swollen eyes, broken teeth and cut lips are trophies. Another aspect of the movie is idol worship. There is one scene that is especially grotesque and beautiful in illustrating the paradox of FIGHT CLUB. Norton horribly disfigures a new recruit. Asked why he replied nonchalantly that he \\"wanted to destroy something beautiful.\\" This, to me, foretold the direction of the organization towards vandalism.<br /><br />The picture has a slick green hue similar to the sheen of the Matrix movies, or the hard, silver tint James Cameron uses. CGI is very effective throughout. Norton's fear is exposed in a chaotic sequence showing his internal physiology. In another, the picture jumps like a speaker to Brad Pitt's voice. Fight Club feels like a graphic novel-- very surreal and fun to look at. But it's not for everyone. Fincher did a great job. He could have shined it up and turned the noise down but didn't. I highly recommend it!iful.\\" This, to me, foretold the direction of the organization towards vandalism.    <br /> <br />The picture has a slick green hue similar to the sheen of the Matrix movies, or the hard, silver tint James Cameron uses.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|The Rolling Stones said it better than anyone- \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\". And so it is with 'Star Wars', the 1977 original that forever changed the landscape of the summer blockbuster. I don't care about the \\"anamorphic\\" widescreen; when I put the DVD in my DVD player, it works. I don't care about Dolby 5.1; the sound is how I remember seeing it as a 7 year-old. The picture isn't crystal clear, but I say, so what? It is nearly a 30-year old film, and if you want crystal clear picture, watch the 2004 version instead. That's what it's there for. I happen to appreciate a film that doesn't quite have razor-sharp clarity. It lends a bit of nostalgic value. 'Star Wars' doesn't have to look brand new to me, because it isn't brand new. I find it wonderful to finally have a DVD version of the Original Trilogy, no matter if it lacked in the restoration process. Some viewers, like myself, prefer the worn-in feel. I love it.
0375831002|5.0|If you love books and the comfort and escape they bring, this story is for you. The Book Thief's main character, Liesl, becomes the owner of fourteen books in this story, and the events surrounding how she gets each book lead us through her life as a foster child in Nazi Germany.  The events are narrated by Death, who is so intrigued by Liesl's life that he brings her a book himself. <br /> <br />This story shows how patient love can heal a damaged spirit and that the best gifts don't cost any money.  It also shows that kindness and compassion are liabilities in a world ruled by evil and that war claims its victims in many ways. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I will admit that when I got this series set, I spent DAYS watching from beginning to end. What a great series! Now I know this collector's set is expensive, but for a true fan, worth it. The casing is exquisite, and the DVD extras are highly entertaining. My favorite were the quizzes to determine which of the girls you are most like, and which of the \\"Sex\\" men you are most compatible with. Sure some of the questions are pretty transparent, but it's fun. If you're a \\"Sex-aholic\\" this is a must-have!
1563523302|5.0|If you only read one book in your life, read The Millionaire Next Door.  This book enabled me through education to change my life goals, be career-oriented, and start a successful small business, all at the age of 22. <br /> <br />My first few years of college were essentially a blur, as was my academic record.  One could count my achievements with one hand. <br /> <br />Then I found Millionaire. <br /> <br />As the title suggests, this is not a book about methods and schemes for making millions.  It is about the average Joe you already know.  It is about the guy next door who is sitting on a million dollars, and the discipline, genius, and sacrifices he needed to get there. <br /> <br />Thomas J. Stanley debunks the aristocracy myth with this statistic from his book: 80% of all Americans with a net worth of at least $1,000,000 are first-generation millionaires.  Armed with this newfound knowledge, he actually shows you how to become one of these 80%.  He explains the methodical process necessary to become a millionaire.  This book encourages you to cut out the excess in your life and become a smart saver and investor.  It can show you the path to self-discipline, and helps to reorient your priorities.  I recommend this book to any one high school age and up. <br /> <br />If you are looking for stock tips, hedge funds, or venture capital schemes, get a grip.  If you are ready to change your life, get The Millionaire Next Door.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|In the Zone marks a breakthrough in pop music as the bubblegum pop trend of the late 90s began to transition into electro-hip hop-(bubblegum)-pop.  Britney Spears, N'Sync, and Christina Aguilera were all growing up and ready to break out into new areas of the pop landscape.    In the Zone represents Britney Spears transition into adulthood.  It's a mistake to think the lyrics would be any less sexualized, this is pop music we are talking about.  But Britney has grown as an artist.  Her third album, Britney, is a pinnacle of the bubblegum pop movement, one of the most coherent bubblegum albums with minimal filler.  For In the Zone, she took a step away from being manufactured by stepping into the executive producer's chair and working with a revolving door of producers from R. Kelly to Moby plus a bevy of lesser known producers popular on the club circuit.  The result: Britney expanding her vocal versatility as she explores different pop sounds.    The strongest songs are when she moves towards electro-pop trance.  The pairings of Breathe on Me and Touch of My Hand puts her in Kylie Minogue land, and puts her breathy and husky vocals in a context that feels truly artistic.  They maximize the potential of her voice.  The stripped down ballad, Everytime, dares to put her vocals in a showcase, and it works, revealing an aching vulnerability.  Britney never may have had pitch range, but her voice strikes an emotional chord that not even the screaming Aguilera can GENUINELY reach.    The electro-pop reaches its peak with Toxic.  The acid violins on that song are now iconic and instantly recognizeble.  Even the video, an artistically campy tribute to Jennifer Garner's Alias, is a work of art.    The trifecta of Outrageous, Showdown, and I've Got that (Boom Boom) exemplify pop's infusion with hip hop to abandon its goody goody bubble gum roots.  The Outrageous Tribal Remix is better than the original but its fun.  Showdown reaches back to the Breathe Heavy Sing-Talk of Boys, and Boom Boom with the Ying Yang twins is a great club song with its thumping base.  However, Brave New Girl recalls the bubblegum of the Britney album, a fun upbeat song about fresh starts.    When the album came out, it was criticized for not being a coherent sounding album.  It wasn't supposed to be.  The acoustic Me Against the Music, dance Breathe on Me, and others proved that the album was about Britney exploring the sonic landscape.  At the time it was new for mainstream pop to go this direction.  Now, everyone accepts it.  Beyonce, Usher, and Adam Lambert have utilized the same cover-all-genres approaches.    Unfortunately, this is also the phase of Britney's life where she began to downfall--K Fed, shaved head, and all.  Britney was beginning to finally take the dance music that were just bonus tracks or B-Sides (I highly recommend Before the Goodbye, When I found You, I Run Away) into the main tracks of her album and hence push it more into the mainstream.  Unfortunately, with her breakdown, the people around her once again took full control of her career, which was probably also aided by weak album sales, and Britney lost her Exec Producer credit on Blackout.      I love Blackout, and Circus is a return to a \\"Britney\\" sound, but I can't help but wonder what would have happened if In the Zone had gone well and Britney was allowed even more freedom post-In the Zone.  But I just might found out.  Reports suggest that Britney will be seriously pushing the edges of pop on her next album (thank you for the push Lady Gaga).  Although, Britney shouldn't have needed the advent of Gaga to make her label finally take a chance on artistry, because Britney always had the goods to deliver--In the Zone proved that.

I was just playing with you.<br /><br />The thing I love about the Beatles story, is that they are a group of boys that all grew up close to each other.  They are the original Boy Band, without the pathetic unnatural \\"manufacturing\\" of the band.  Back when they formed, was a time when music was appreciated and composed, not manufactured.<br /><br />I do not have the CD of this album, but I have an \\"original master recording\\" on vinyl which is a very special treat for me to have.  I got this, as well as every other album of theirs, as a special set, for my high-school graduation.  It was an awesome gift from my parents (please see customer image section, where I show a picture of the album)<br /><br />But if you're not like me, and have a wonderful collection already, I would recommend this CD over many of the others they produced.<br /><br />Truly a classic!<br /><br />MC White said:  Two big approving thumbs WAY UP!!!

B000002JSP|3.0|Due to Jimmy Page and John Bonham chasing the tail of the drug dragon and Robert Plant's vocal chords being frayed - a portion of In Through The Out Door was recorded in a studio used by vocal group ABBA - it was up to bassist/keyboard player John Paul Jones to hold the pieces of the band together for the \\"comeback\\" album that was released in the summer of 1979.<br /><br />The original album featured six different inner sleeves, which when brushed over with water, would become fully colored. The \\"cover\\" was made to look like a brown paper bag.<br /><br />The band - unlike The Rolling Stones and The Who - was not known to bring a lot of material into the studio. Not only was that brought out in the previous weak studio albums, Presence and the double-set, Physical Graffiti, but fully demonstrated in Coda, a release of odds-and-ends that was better left on studio tapes, with three of the cuts not making it on In Through The Out Door.<br /><br />Jones co-wrote six of the seven cuts and flexes his artistic skill on Carouselambra, which clocks in at nearly eleven minutes. The CD kicks off on familiar territory, In The Evening, with Bonham's strongest drumming and Page ripping into a solo midway through the song.<br /><br />It is a mixed bag after the two cuts. The band travels over the same turf in Fool In The Rain and I'm Gonna Crawl. The rave-up Hot Dog and AOR sound of All My Love are interesting, but cannot carry the CD to the artistic heights found in the initial four studio releases.<br /><br />But in a summer where punk still showed signs of life, the album debuted on the Billboard chart at number one.<br /><br />In Through The Out Door was slated for release before the Knebworth Festival tour dates, but hit the store shelves slightly after the critically-acclaimed gigs. There were numerous bootleg releases of the Knebworth concerts and fans can sometimes hear the complete show on radio stations with \\"classic rock\\" formats.<br /><br />A highly-anticipated U.S. tour was slated for 1980, but the death of Bonham led to the band disbanding.<br /><br />Jones has taken a lot of flack for his work on the album. Plant and Page have left him dangling alone for the critics to take the brunt of the criticism over the years. Jones has been basically been persona non grata with his former bandmates.<br /><br />Jones was handed the task by default. And he ultimately demonstrated a professionalism that is hardly seen on stage in the rock industry.ipated U.S. tour was slated for 1980, but the death of Bonham led to the band disbanding. <br /> <br />Jones has taken a lot of flack for his work on the album.

B000GPI2EK|2.0|I'm a big mastodon fan and expected something better than what they did on this album. I mean, these are just rehashed riffs that they have used before, only now they are rearranging them. There are definitely some stand out spots that caught my attention but wow, overall, it's just a letdown. I'll stick with lifesblood and remission. This band is too popular to make an album like that again.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|WORLD WIDE SUICIDE! This song rocks my socks off! Complete with trite lyrics and a washed up lead singer, Pearl Jam really over did themseleves this time.  I thought they were simply a relic from the early 90's grunge scene - and boy was I wrong! They've brought back talentless music to the masses! Thank you Eddie & friends!

B0001KZM3O|1.0|I felt at the time when The Final Cut was released that Roger Waters wanted to destroy the band to set the table for his solo career. I have not wavered from that opinion over the years.<br /><br />Without the guidance of producer Bob Ezrin and guitarist David Gilmour, who kept Waters in check while developing elements of The Wall during the recording process, the path was clear for his self-indulgence to take center stage. It is Pink Floyd in name only, with Waters supported by a number of guest musicians.<br /><br />Keyboardist Richard Wright was told by Waters that he was sacked before The Wall tour, hence he does not appear on the album. It is questionable how much studio time was clocked by Gilmour or drummer Nick Mason.<br /><br />Waters decries the use of war as a tool by governments. He juxtaposes the the death of his father in the battle of Anzio in World War II with the Falkland Islands War and the Cold War hysteria that was gripping the superpowers in the early 1980s. New production techniques made for better sound quality on vinyl.<br /><br />But it fails on many levels because Waters is screeching to himself. It is a great representation of what happens to a band that fails to have the checks and balances of developing ideas into music.<br /><br />At this point in time, Waters delivered his final cut on many levels.

B000002OVJ|5.0|Originally released as a means to have an official live album in the catalog, The Who are heard in their sonic splendor mixed with the straight-ahead R&B roots in the Leeds University concert from February 1970.<br /><br />In the original single album release, the Young Man Blues and Summertime Blues were absolutely unbelievable and have such unbridled energy that makes the cuts sound fresh and urgent nearly 40 years later. The vocals by Roger Daltrey and frantic drumming by Keith Moon makes Shakin' All Over sound like an original composition from the band.<br /><br />This digitized reissue includes eight additional selections - bringing the number of tracks to fourteen - including a mainstay in the band's live shows, I Can't Explain, Fortune Teller - a R&B classic that was played in the early live sets by The Rolling Stones - Happy Jack and A Quick One.<br /><br />A deluxe edition includes the entire concert, with one of the earliest live recordings of the rock opera, Tommy.<br /><br />The Who was known for its live performances more than its studio work. This blistering set shows the band in their prime and demonstrates why The Who was perhaps the greatest rock group ever.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have seen John Mayer live three times over the last several years.  Not because i am a fan, but because my daughter (now 18)thinks he is \\"so cute\\".  The live shows were better than the CD's I had to listen to on the way to the concert, but I never became a fan.. I bought Continuum for my daughter and played it on the way home. I was extremely surprised.  This is a great R&B flavored album (reminiscent of Sam cooke and Marvin Gaye).  Mailed my daughter her copy, and went back and bought one for myself.  May have to go see John in concert again.
B0002858YS|5.0|Hot Fuss is amazing. Every track on the cd is worth listening to.

It's similar to the sounds of Hot Hot Heat, Franz Ferdinand, and The Strokes.<br /><br />This cd has songs that are upbeat and great to dance to. It's also great for when you are in the car.<br /><br />It's defenately worth every penny of what you spend on it.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Another jewell to DT's crown as masters of progressive rock. I've been fan of the band since Images & Words and i was only able to finally watch them live on February 26th, 2006 when they played a magnificent sold out concert in Bogota - Colombia. <br /> <br />This DVD was everything i was hoping from them. Video quality is amazing (better than Budokan). Sound quality is great too but i would rate it on a same level as Budokan. <br /> <br />Altough many people complains about the Setlist, i think is ok. It definitely works for me. The songs were well chosen and the orchestra in the second half of the concert was truly amazing. <br /> <br />I was surprised but pleased that the main star on this show were not MP or JP... but James LaBrie. His performance was absolutely phenomenal (Thumbs up for him) <br /> <br />The second DVD comes with the 20 years documentary plus some other features (Including some other live performances). <br /> <br />All in all this is a must have package for any DT fan or for anyone who loves beautifully played music. <br /> <br />Go for it right now, you wont be dissapointed. <br /> <br />Cheers! <br /> <br />
6305511055|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the novel \\"Six Days of the Condor\\" (1974) by James Grady.<br /><br />This movie is about a man named Joe Turner (Robert Redford) who \\"just read[s] books\\" with six others at a place called the \\"American Literary Historical Society\\" (ALHS).  Turner and his literary colleagues are also non-practicing CIA agents with Turner having the code name \\"Condor.\\"<br /><br />On this particular day it was Turner's turn to pick up lunch for the others at the office.  He exits through a rear door of the ALHS to do so.  On returning with lunch he finds all his colleagues murdered.  He now runs for his life.<br /><br />Turner reports this massacre to his superior (Cliff Robertson), a man he has never met.  He suddenly finds himself the target of both his employers and the unknown murderers of his associates.  He randomly abducts a lonely photographer (Faye Dunaway) who is forced to hide him and later helps him discover the answer to the following question:<br /><br />\\"What's the secret worth murdering everybody at the ALHS house?\\"<br /><br />This movie was an unexpected surprise for me.  While starting out tame, it turns into an intense thriller with excellent acting.  Redford, Robertson, and Dunaway give good performances.  However, my biggest kudos must go to someone I never mentioned in the above summary--Max von Sydow who ruthlessly and chillingly plays a maverick hit man.<br /><br />The background music adds to each scene.  I found the cinematography of mid-seventies New York interesting.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released Aug. 1999) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one extra.<br /><br />In conclusion, after watching this movie, you'll be asking yourself the same question Turner asks:<br /><br />\\"Do you believe the Condor is really an endangered species?\\"<br /><br />(1975;  1 hr, 55 min; wide screen;  16 scenes;  rated `R')<br /><br />+++++
B000FUF6QS|5.0|THE WICKER MAN concerns a hyper-religious cop named Howie (Edward Woodward), who gets caught up in a deepening mystery when his search for a missing girl named Rowan Morrison leads him to the small island community of Summerisle. Poor Howie is almost instantly offended by the inhabitants and their pagan beliefs! He is bombarded by the very \\"sins\\" his religion condemns! Howie's search for Rowan becomes almost secondary to his own inner conflicts and turmoil, especially when Willow (Britt Ekland) does a VERY seductive, totally nude dance (even better than Annik Borel's neggid number in Werewolf Woman), tempting him from another room! Let me tell you, she melted me in my seat! Where was I? Oh yeah, this movie uses authentic pagan rituals, which makes it realistic and cool. I felt myself wanting to enjoy life as much as they did, at least until the terrifying finalé! Christopher Lee is perfect as Lord Summerisle, the grandson of the man who introduced paganism to the island. His character is hard to read and that's a good thing! I still don't know if he was wholly sincere, a faker, good, or pure evil! I just know that his performance sticks in my head like the rest of this classic...
0446677450|5.0|I stole this book from a friend to read because he was taking too long to finish it. I think this is one of the GREATEST books i have ever read. What i like about it is that after you finish it you want more. You realise that everything you have been trying to accomplish could happen so much faster if you know what you are doing. My goal is to become a 'sophisticated investor'.  Right now my boyfriend and i are on a quest to become financially free. We are new borns to this investing world. At this moment i do not even know what a 'stock' or 'bond' is but believe me, this book has given me the fire i need to find out. THANK YOU MR. KIYOSAKI!

I can't begin to see how helpful it was to get the baby into a routine instead of dragging her around and keeping her out to suit my needs. Once you see how happy and rested you can be by following some simple routines it really made a difference. I would highly recommend this book.

Allbeit quite good, but I'm sick of people asking me \\"What kind of music do you like\\" and I say \\"I'm a metalhead\\" and they reply with some nonsense like \\"like metallica or iron maiden?\\"  HOLY CHRIST! The genre has evolved since 197?, whenever you felt you last \\"ROCKED\\" <br /> <br />This is a great album, buy it!  BUT don't feel like you're \\"rocking out\\" because it is POP music.  I pray I age better than most I meet and don't start referring chimaira, A7X, and bleeding through as heavy music 20 years from now. <br /> <br />Your metal is now pop, it's very good, but please don't insult heavy music.
1592400876|5.0|It's easy to see how the book's breezy run through \\"the notations of music of the spoken language\\" has made it a bestseller. It's a memorable reminder of the purpose of punctuation in the first place: to clarify syntax and meaning. Ms. Truss does that with élan! <br /> <br />From humorous examples of the daily bugaboos that make email unreadable (\\"let me know if your coming to lunch\\" and \\"are their any left?\\" were recently in my email) to the weightier influence of comma placement (Jesus to thief on the cross: \\"and He said unto him, today thou shalt be with me in paradise\\" or was it \\"and He said unto him today, thou shalt be with me in paradise\\" in which the latter leaves a huge gap for purgatory) the author provides a neat understanding of common - and not so common - grammar rules without any sense of reading a rule book. <br /> <br />With a dash of history, gracious pauses for appreciation of growth and flexibility in language, and a lot of good romping pillow fight fun you will get to the end of the book before you are ready. Enjoy!
B00005JOYM|5.0|This movie was obviously a very difficult one to see.  Unlike other movies people see, we all know the outcome to this one, death and destruction.  Yet, underneath all that we find ourselves happy that the two Port Authority police officers were two of the lucky ones that were pulled from the rubble.  We will never forget those who did not survive and will always pay tribute to them.  I believe this movie was made with class.  Oliver Stone did a great job and I believe he did it with the utmost respect to everyone involved in this horrible tragedy.
B000000H3Z|5.0|I was researching for a good thrash band on the internet & bought this album of Sepultura & the minute I listen to it I was hooked. I can't beleive that this Brazilian metal band existed since the 80's & I didn't have any idea how great they are or if they existed. Most of the songs in this cd are excellent eventhough they all sound the same. I will cherish this like I cherish my Vengeance Rising album for life & will continue doing my research to find the best thrash bands that are available to metalheads like me.
B000H305U0|3.0|This cd is overrated. I used to love JT, but I kinda knew what was to come when I saw him in concert recently.   <br /> <br />Futuresex/Lovesounds- 7/10 not bad, you can groove to it, it reminds me of older hip hop...maybe a lil gap band? Nevertheless, I like it. <br /> <br />Sexyback- 10/10 i thought the rest of the cd was going to be like this, this is an undeniable track, it makes you get up and dance like a fool, I love it! <br /> <br />Sexy ladies- 7/10 hollaback 80s.  This is the beginning of his bringing 80s back with bass.  Again, I'm getting that old hip-hop vibe.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it's just recycling, not the future. <br /> <br />My Love- 8.5/10 I love this song, but only because of the beat.  The lyrics are pretty mediocre, and as soon as I stop loving the beat, I won't like the song anymore. <br /> <br />LoveStoned- 8.5/10 This again, is a great beat.  I think I ignored whatever he was saying. <br /> <br />What Goes Around- 6/10 The lyrics are forgettable and so is the beat, it irritates me to even listen to this song in its entirety. I was bored when he sang it live as well. <br /> <br />Chop Me Up- 4/10 This sounds like every other generic hip hop song on the radio nowadays, and it reminds me of Kevin Federline for some reason.  Simply put, it's a filler track. <br /> <br />Damn Girl- 9/10 I love this song.  Yeah, ok, the lyrics pretty much are not good, but the feel good chords just make you want to drive with your windows down and the breeze of 75 degree air making your hair a mess. The rap doesn't really add to the song though. <br /> <br />summerlove- 4/10 I get so annoyed with this beat that I haven't even listened to the entire song yet, and I just tried again...I just..can't.  UGH!!  <br /> <br />Until the End of Time- 5/10 Reminescent of Genuwine's \\"Differences\\" no? I'll just listen to that song. <br /> <br />Losing My Life- 8/10 Not a great beat, but the lyrics are good.  It's the first time he's talking about something that matters, I wish the rest of the cd was like this (lyrics-wise). <br /> <br />(Another song) All Over Again- 7.5/10 I like the chords and the fact it is a piano based song. It's a pleasant listen and probably the most heartfelt song on the album. <br /> <br />Pose- 7/10 I guess it could be interesting to listen to after a while, It's not anything special or new. <br /> <br />Overall, some of these songs are excellent, but the main reason behind the successful songs is a man named Timbaland.  It's not really fair to say JT has grown as an artist because the lyrics from his last cd were actually better.  He has a couple filler songs, and for him to have us wait this long, there shouldn't be any fillers. The songs that are good are really good, but the songs that are not so good are not even worth listening to.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0671027344|5.0|I read this book with the strict recommendation of a friend of mine who turned me onto Jonathan Safran Foer, David Yoo, Dave Eggers, etc. I was really impressed and loved it!  All of the authors mentioned have this incredible ability to make you focus in, and feel what it is their characters are going through. If you haven't read this yet, I would do so at your first opportunity.
B000H305U0|1.0|This cd has only a few songs that have a good dance beat.  Seems that it's one of rip off deals where the single was pushed because it's one of the few good songs.  But, I'm sorry, you can dance to these few upbeat songs, but Justin just can not sing.  The vocals are horrible.  Bottom line, you'd be better off to just buy the single.  The rest of cd is just okay, and if you like good vocals, don't bother at all.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I have seen over 500 movies, and this movie is in my top ten greatest movies of all time.  This movie is JAM PACKED with action and exciting moments.  Just following along is EXHILARATING!  And the cast... THE CAST!!  You have Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Billy Bob Thornton, and William Fichtner.  Does it get any better than that?  I have seen this movie over and over and still love it.  You may shed a tear over it, so keep the Kleenex handy.  If you are an action movie fan, there is no doubt in my mind that this movie belongs in your collection.
B00005JP87|3.0|This is a film that offers so much silliness and hooey that I just couldn't buy in. I would have loved to see real illusions performed, rather than the cgi nonsense seen here. Watching a movie about magic, I'd much prefer to see David Blaine-like illusions rather than these hopelessly physics and reason-defying jokes. And having a book with Michaelangelo-like diagrams in it showing how the trick is built makes no difference. They are stupid and irritating.<br /><br />Many have pointed out how lovely this film is. That it certainly is. It looks great, and I never grew tired of the soft focus and sepia haze. Costumes, swords, helmets, trains, stage lighting, carriages all looked superlative. But look only goes so far. Phillip Glass has indeed cannibalized his previous work, though at least the score was not annoying. And we can debate whether this or that actor was good or bad. For my taste, Edward Norton was just too cold and cerebral; why would this woman love him? But generally I accepted the performances.<br /><br />No, a film like this lives or dies on plot, and if anyone was surprised by the ending, they must have been sleeping. I too was hoping some better illusion was impending, one that hadn't been telgraphed, telephoned, billboarded, and announced in any number of ways. But no, the ending we all thought was coming came chugging in, right on schedule, with all the remarkable coincidences and unlikely events (good thing the Prince didn't drink just a bit more, or less, of that potion, and oh, the convenient Friar Lawrence magic worked a little better here than for Romeo and Juliet) tidily cleaned up in fast-forward.<br /><br />So a beautiful film that promised a lot and didn't quite deliver. Not bad, and not one that made me fume, but they cheated way more than they should be allowed to.
B00005V9IK|5.0|Who will win?  You will have to watch and see.  Really though, this is a great movie.  The plot is there, the cast is strong, and it is really interesting.  Parts of it make you wonder if there really was an alien spacecraft recovered by the government.  It is very cool throughout, and \\"in your face\\".  There is never a dull moment.  I love Will Smith, Brent Spiner, Jeff Goldblum, and Harry Connick Jr., and they were ALL in this movie!  Honestly folks, this is one of the best Sci-Fi action movies ever made.  VERY entertaining.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I should, by all means, like this band. I love Rage Against The Machine. I love Soundgarden. Therefore, combining the band from the former and the frontman from the latter, Audioslave should be a home run, right? <br /> <br />Hardly. This album is decent, sure, but nothing really reaches out and grabs me. It's almost as if they played it safe and didn't take any chances. \\"Cochise\\" and \\"What You Are\\" are good, but the rest just bores me. <br /> <br />I dunno. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I am slowly slipping into senility. But the bottom line is, Audioslave is a decent rock band, but they are capable of more than this. <br /> <br />Okay, go ahead and click that jolly, candy-like \\"NO\\" button below.
B00005V9IL|5.0|If Sci-Fi is your cup of tea, you may want to buy this movie.  In case you haven't heard, there are beautiful benevolent aliens in it.  The villain is a human being.  Also, this movie contains one of the BEST resuscitation scenes ever created.  Extremely believable and heart wrenching.  In addition, there are more gripping moments besides that.  Ed Harris is perfect for the role, and the entire cast performs admirably.  There are some surprise moments, which will keep you on your toes.  Overall, a 4 1/2 star movie.
1400034779|5.0|I put off reading this book because I was afraid it was just a chick-lit entry, and being a guy, I wasn't looking forward to that. But how wrong was I. This book is refreshing and charming. Watching this lady grow into her job and solve crimes or offer assistance in a straight-forward, common sense way, all the while maintaining perspective and her humor, is just a lot of fun. The challenges grow from finding out if a stranger is someone's Daddy to undercovering human sacrifice involving high political figures, yet our heroine applies her ever abundant gift of simplicity and ingenuity to tackle every problem. This book is different from almost any other book in the mystery genre, but it's new and refreshing and proves that just because a genre is old and established doesn't mean it can't be expanded into new areas. What an enjoyable book. I'm now going to order the rest of the series.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is set in a period where emotions are banned due to them being unpredictable and often causing unfavorable results.  What follows by banning emotions and all things that would lead to emotion is a very oppressive scenario indeed.  People are ordered to take a drug to drown out their emotions, and all objects (including music and books) that could lead to emotion are destroyed.  As I said, very oppressive.  After missing a dose of his emotion-blocking drug, Christian Bale's character sees the light, both literally and figuratively.  What follows is a suspenseful action-packed plot, and ultimately a good ending.  Glad our government is not like that.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|This is a movie that I had hesitated to see. The trailer looked shockingly good, but then again so does every trailer thanks to the highly advanced art of hollywood trickery these days. Additionally, I had never played the video game, and I wasn't sure if it was anything to get excited about. Luckily, my roommate was the one to splurge $20 on it and not me, and I got to see it.  <br />Despite the fact that they're churning out video games as fast as they can, most of which are helmed by the repugnant Uwe Boll, this is a solid horror movie. I have no idea how much it lifts either directly or loosely from the game, but it does provide some remarkable visuals and even better ideas. It's not reliant on pure atmosphere like The Ring or any of the J-Horror clones that have become so prominent lately, nor is it just one huge gorefest like the Nightmare on Elm Street series or Friday the 13th. Instead it walks somewhere in the middle while adding a nice adventure element that I'm guessing comes fairly faithfully from the game. It's refreshing that the movie isn't themed to the point that it's a one-trick pony, instead it brings out a new and exciting monster or revelation every so often to keep it fresh.  <br />All in all, this movie may not be 5 stars, but it does deserve the title of the best video game movie (or perhaps the only good one) to date.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Stanley Kubrick had something to do with this story, and Steven Spielberg was very involved in making the film, so you know it's going to be interesting.  Haley Joel Osment plays a highly advanced robot looking to receive love and so goes on a quest to become real so his human mother will love him.  He believes that the blue fairy from popular children's literature actually exists, and can transform him.  Along the way he teams up with Jude Law's character, also a highly advanced (a lover model) robot, and Teddy, a stuffed bear supertoy that can see, hear, walk, and talk.  Rather than tell you what happens every step of the way, let me just say that this movie is brilliant, and tugs at your heartstrings in a big way.  I cried, saw it again, and cried again.  It helps if you are a Sci-Fi fan, but if you are not, you will probably still enjoy it.  The ending is quite unexpected, but goes extremely well with the movie.  I know I will see this movie again, many times over.
0767853636|5.0|The Amazon review by Tom Keogh is totally ridiculous. \\"Charmless and dull???\\" I saw this movie about 8 times when it came out when I was little and was loved it so much. It's full of adventure, great songs, and a story about wanting to belong that children and adults can both relate to. The performances are great. One of Carol Burnett's best. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it now.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|Insurrection grabs you from the start and doesn't let go.  You are drawn into the story, and you consistently find interesting things along the way to ponder or enjoy.  I was amazed at how captivating this movie was, compared to the previous Star Trek movies (it beats them all), or even compared to movies in general.  If you are a Star Trek fan or an action movie/sci-fi fan, check out this movie.  It will not disappoint you.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|From the first listen to the one now (about 63 times in a week), I find this the most enjoyable album he has made in 41 years. The blues predominates, his gravelly voice is exactly what the lyrics and music demand, and everything about every song is the best you'll ever get in the music available right now. Bobby is as good as he's ever been. Time to celebrate!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The effects and fight scenes are amped up this time around, matching the impressive level of its predecessor.  For instance, Trinity on that black Ducati sportbike!  She RULED!  Don't try that at home kids...  But let's not leave Neo out.  That one fight scene where Neo uses the sign post as a Bo staff and lets loose on like 100 agents at once!  BAM!  How about them apples?  I am a big fan of the Matrix trilogy.  In fact, the first one is my favorite movie.  But even so, in many ways Reloaded is equally good.  I recommend you get all 3 movies.  They are really hot titles, and their replay value is high.  Enjoy!
B00004Y3OU|5.0|I first saw Cinema Paradiso on a small screen (24?\\") T.V. in the shortened original VHS for theatre distribution version. O.K. A number of years later, I was fortunate enough to see the Director's Cut on the big screen.  Before or since, I never have shed tears like that in the theatre.  Not only for the sadness... but for the sublimity.<br /><br />Generally regarded as one of the greatest masterpieces of the art, by all means, do not pass judgement until you have seen the original: the Director's Cut.  Worth every penny! This version is how the film should be seen - in its entirety. Also - I saw it, up close, on a massive (not 'plexed') old time screen.  Then, one really gets the idea of the town square being at the center of the cosmos. See it as large as possible. Even then, this film will always be somewhat larger.
6304711891|5.0|The Rock features pulse pounding nail biting edge of your seat entertainment.  With names such as Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris, you know you are in for a treat.  It has some FBI action, some military action, and delivers intense action for the action movie fan.  Did I say action enough?  That is because this movie is full of it.  Highly recommended.
0441009425|2.0|This is one of those books that you need to work really hard to get into and be prepared for a lot of unexplained terms and references.  <br /> <br />The problem with this book is that it reads like it's the second in a series - not the first. There's so much back story that's left untold that I found myself scratching my head at the end of each section. The author references Pattern Jugglers and Shrouders and something sinister between them and the main character, Sylveste, but leaves them unexplained. This, in addition to Sylveste's apparent, yet unelaborated, physical anomalies.  <br /> <br />Regarding the main character, Sylveste - here's a man who has an obvious physical deformity incurred during a \\"razorstorm\\" (prior to the beginning of the book) which ruined his eyes and forced their replacement. Yet there's no description provided. All the other characters acknowledge it but the reader is left wondering - are they mechanical? Organic, but some odd color? What? What makes them notable? Is he scarred? Some mystery surrounding the main characters is healthy but the author crossed the line between vagueness and outright obfuscation. <br /> <br />With each section and accompanying main character I was trying not only to acclimate to a universe 500 years in the future but also to these very complex characters with intricate subplots and backgrounds. Then, when the author has given you the briefest of glimpses of the character and you've accumulated a bunch of questions regarding him or her, you're shuttled to a different character and the process is repeated and more questions raised and stored. It proved too difficult for me to get into and I ended up putting the book down unfinished. <br />
B0007RT9LW|4.0|If you like Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie, you have to see this movie.  Also, you get a taste of some hot cars, and fast driving.  Always teetering on the brink of being busted, the story is suspenseful and you wonder how the heck can they pull it all off.  But they are professionals, and get the job done.  For the most part.  Four stars.
B000H305U0|4.0|It's always good to see people recover from their mistakes.  While Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson continue to make ridiculous music with in the same talentless vein that they started out in, Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake both jumped ship at the proper time and have both put out two respectable albums since the end of their shallow-pop phase (and curiously seem to like releasing them within weeks of each other).  While Christina has been delving into weighty territory, Justin has been mostly exploring the experimental side of music with Timbaland--seemingly picking up where Aaliyah left off.  And what an impressive mix these two are!  Justin has a very keen ear for melody and harmony, as well as irresistable charisma at the microphone.  Timbaland, on the other hand, is perhaps the most important producer in R&B and hip-hop music of his time.  Of all his work, however, I think his best stuff has come about when he has been working with Missy Elliott, Justin, Aaliyah, and Brandy.  With the previously mentioned artists, he has managed to create music that blasts them into a whole new level, making their sound edgy, powerful, and addictive.  This album is no exception. <br /> <br />For the most part, Justin's album does seem to be driven by the desire for sex and love (as the title suggests).  For the most part, this actually works.  The tracks are very different from each other, and both the producing and vocal ends come together to make some really gripping music.  However, the one area where Justin does fall short, though, is in the songwriting.  While he sometimes comes up with innovative lyrics, he occasionally gets lazy and starts using the cliche R&B words and phrases.  Simplicity is fine, but not when your subject matter is pretty much the same!  He should sit down and listen to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill the next time he's thinking of writing a song.  A little vocabulary lesson can go a long way. <br /> <br />My only other gripe is that I wasvery excited to see that I was getting the Best Buy Exclusive bonus track \\"Pose\\" (featuring Snoop Dogg) when I bought my CD.  Sadly, I was disappointed by it and wish it never would have been put on.  To me, it sounds like Jay-Z's \\"Change Clothes\\" would sound if the lyrics were severely dumbed down. <br /> <br />To me, the stand-out track on the album is \\"What Goes Around Comes Around\\".  It sounds like it's pretty obviously a powerful diss to Britney Spears, following up on his \\"Cry Me A River\\" single.  Similarly, the melodies and harmonies are just as powerful as the venom-laced lyrics--the main difference in this song being that Justin seems to be implying that he has found all the closure he needs by seeing her personal life and career begin to nosedive.  Brilliant move, Justin.  You (and America) are better off without her!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Even though this film was released in 1985, now, more than 20 years later, it is still highly entertaining.  You get at least a few moments with each character, develop a feel for them, and come to like them all.  You really want to see them succeed, and the suspense of whether they will or not is constant.  This movie is good for all ages, and is rated PG.  The Cyndi Lauper \\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\\" song was a nice touch.  Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg created a magical movie that will be enjoyed for years to come.
B00001R3CQ|5.0|This is very early T. Dream when Klaus Schulze was on drums & Conrad Schnitzler was in them. Great Deep Space Avant-rock. Nothing like the later Soundtracks & stuff where thay got all technoey. A classic of early German Krautrock. Sounds like Ash Ra Tempel (Who Klaus Schulze also drummed on the 1st two LP's) if Conrad Scnitzler was in them.
B0001O3YC6|5.0|What is out there?  Will it get us?  These are the questions that run through the minds of the characters in the film.  Vin Diesel was born for this role.  He plays a convict that is supposed to be transported, but he ends up getting out and helping the characters survive the alien onslaught.  Riddick does a wicked good job making you believe he is hardcore and you shouldn't mess with him.  He is also the savior of the movie.  All in all, Sci-Fi fans everywhere should see this movie.  I liked it better than Chronicles of Riddick (Pitch Black 2).
B00005NKKY|5.0|\\"Bookends\\" shows a leap in creativity for Simon & Garfunkel, having been allowed more studio time by their record company, Columbia to really harness their craft and the end result is truly a work of art.  Their first album, \\"Wednesday Morning 3AM\\" showed Paul and Art in a purely 1960's folk music light, while their next two albums, \\"Sounds of Silence\\" and \\"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme\\" saw the duo enhance a \\"folk rock\\" style with some wonderful, sometimes whimsical melodies and beautifully poetic lyrics. Here on \\"Bookends\\" though, it feels as though Simon & Garfunkel have grown up. There's a more mature approach to the songwriting, the performances and to the production. They sound like young men with old heads on their shoulders, which could be seen as ironic as this album's theme (or at least side one of it) is one of aging. Paul and Art chose to start the album somewhat up tempo, moving to songs of reflection and ending with something slower and simpler, all in all to reflect the growing up and growing old in life while bookending the songs with a \\"Bookends\\" theme.<br /><br />Following the short \\"Bookends\\" theme intro, the album bursts open with the vibrant \\"Save The Life Of My Child\\" before settling down with \\"America\\". The imagery created by the lyrics in this song is made all the more vivid by the soft tones Paul Simon sings it in before Simon & Garfunkel's unfailing harmonies crescendo to lead the song into an instrumental fade. The song is such a wonderful tale of a young, innocent, naive couple, clearly in love and looking for adventure with no real direction, while at the same time looking for themselves. You can really imagine the sense of fun and excitement the couple are having on the Greyhound bus they boarded in Pittsburgh when Paul sings, \\"Laughing on the bus playing games with the faces. She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy. I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera\\". Towards the end of the song it feels as though the fun has subsided as something unpretentious makes Paul sing, \\"Cathy I'm lost I said though I knew she was sleeping. I'm empty and aching and I don't know why\\". Cathy was the name of Paul Simon's girlfriend at the time, so the song at that point really seems \\"first person\\" in narrative, perhaps based on a real life experience. It's a fascinating song whatever. \\"Overs\\" is a very simplistic song of dilemma. Simon feels his relationship with his girlfriend/wife has run its course after a long period of time (\\"We're just a habit, like saccharin\\", he sings), but each time he feels he has gained enough courage to break off the relationship he stops and reconsiders. Why he reconsiders is not clear. Perhaps after being in the relationship so long he's actually more afraid of being alone. The album's theme of growing older is addressed here with Art Garfunkel's beautiful bridge where he sings, \\"Time is tapping on my forehead, Hanging from my mirror, Rattling the teacups.\\" \\"Voices Of Old People\\" is literally just that, with some quite strange comments made by the elderly voices recorded. This leads into \\"Old Friends\\" which is a perfect musical metaphor for slowing down, reflecting on life and now finding it \\"terribly strange to be 70\\". We all hope to reach 70 some day, but at the same time we can't really imagine ourselves being that age.<br /><br />With the album's linking theme completed on Side One, Side Two continues with a very similar style in songwriting and sound. \\"Fakin' It\\" tells of Paul Simon's distrust of the 1960's \\"flower power\\" movement with the line, \\"And a walk in the garden wears me down\\". It has an infectious drum track at the end and features an interesting break in the song where, from out of nowhere, a girl with a Lancashire accent (from northwest England) is heard supposedly entering a shop and says, \\"Good Morning, Mr. Leech. Have you had a busy day?\\". \\"Punky's Dilemma\\" is a fun song and unavoidably comes across as such with lyrics like, \\"Wish I was an Englishmuffin, 'Bout to make the most out of a toaster. I'd ease myself down, Comin' up brown\\". The album concludes with three very recognizable songs from the Simon & Garfunkel songbook - one of their biggest hits, \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" from the soundtrack to the hit movie, \\"The Graduate\\", along with \\"A Hazy Shade Of Winter\\" and \\"At The Zoo.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bookends\\" tends to get overshadowed by its follow-up, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" which went on to become one of the most successful and biggest-selling albums of all time and the winner of five Grammy awards. Whilst it deserved every bit of success and acclaim, the only minor criticism Paul Simon later leant to the \\"Troubled Water\\" album was that it might have been slightly overproduced. Compared to \\"Bookends\\" this does ring true and as a consequence it feels a little more \\"serious\\" in its approach. \\"Bookends\\" at least adopts more of an air of looseness and fun, despite not sounding as instantly commercial as the \\"Troubled Water\\" album. For me, \\"Bookends\\" is the quintessential Simon & Garfunkel album with the duo on peak form before their personal and professional differences interfered with their relationship. In 1968 they were riding the wave of their success through a collection of classic songs that perfectly reflect the time in which they were composed and recorded.ish muffin, 'Bout to make the most out of a toaster.

B0001BKAEY|5.0|While it would be hard for any movie to top the original Matrix, this movie attempts to do so.  On some levels, it is the best Matrix movie yet.  It goes out with a bang.  Without ruining the ending, I will say that it is a climactic experience, and keeps you pinned to your seat thirsty for more every step of the way.  This movie, as well as the previous 2, belong in the collections of action fans everywhere.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|An OK Disney film. <br /> <br />I did not think it was as bad  as I  had heard it was supposed to be. <br /> <br />Made the story for today's audience, other wise getting points of view across not an enjoyable story to live through the ages & can be enjoyed by an audience 20 or 30 years from now, just for today`s audience.  Reminds me of Brother Bear. <br /> <br />A BIG disappointment , however, was the LACK of a Disney soundtrack.  What I mean here is rerecordings of older pop songs.  That was a shame. <br />
0634049011|5.0|I have played the guitar for many years and performed in a number of bands and was completely self-taught.  I decided it was time to se what others had to say about the organization of the fretboard.  Of all the authors I have seen, this guy get it right; is approach is also uncluttered.  The book is well organized and builds from the basics of where the tonics are (the first note of the scales), through major and minor scales and arpeggios and then into the more exotic scales and arpeggios.  His approach of writing, memorizing and playing is sound.  I recommend this for any level of player who is serious about learning the fretboard.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album helped me so much to understand the world and myself. I've struggled a long time with self-doubt. This CD taught me that all I got to do is BE ME!! Thanks to Cornell and friends: I AM ME!! I also got off drugs, stayed in school, and found Jesus. Happy days are here again!!
0385336691|3.0|\\"The Hard way\\" , like other Child's books, is still a pageturner and fast reading. But for the first time in these series I couldn't wait for the book to end. As other reviewers mentioned, it is really annoying to read \\"Reacher said nothing\\" three to five times on each page. Also, Child began to repeat himself; all those kidnapping plots lost their originality and the end was so predictable after first hundred pages that I continued reading just to get a closure. <br />As for the closure, I'd really like to get the last book in the series - where Reacher loses (he does not have to die, but at least to lose his composure... get married, at least!:-). His character stopped any development, and even though this stability has some charm in the first books, by now it became annoying cliche.
0393327655|1.0|Sam Harris...where do I start. I wouldn't want to live in Sam's perfect world, a world devoid of faith. He echoes the beliefs of early 20th German thinkers who felt that religion was the greatest threat to the new world order they wished to build. This 'new age' philosophy in Germany, centerd on humanism, led to Nazism and a committment to the destruction of religion. The Nazis did not need religion or faith to begin their reign of terror; you knew when the SS had been through a town because they would burn churches and break the legs of crucifixes (you can read interviews with German soldiers detailing these eyewitness accounts and testifying that the SS took blood oaths to destroy Christ, but I digress). Yes, the Nazis at first made deals with the Catholic Church, hiding their sins and portraying themselves as Christian, but we now know the truth. This same philosophy that Sam backs was also the driving belief in the lives of Stalin and so many others who sought to build a human state where religion could not 'poison peoples' minds.' If you want a view of what Sam's America would look like, watch the film \\"Equilibrium,\\" especially the sword fights (well, that has nothing to do with my point, but Christian Bale looks cool).
B00005NKKZ|5.0|You don't have to be a baby boomer to love this album, but if you do remember when it first came out, that makes it all the more wonderful.  The title track is one of my favorite songs of all time, and the acoustic demo track at the end, never before released, is awesome.  It lacks the gorgeous orchestration and the two-part vocal harmonies of the final version, but has a somewhat different set of lyrics that are breathtakingly beautiful.  I don't know why Simon changed them.  However, the more familiar lyrics are also lovely, so I'm not complaining.  But it's great to have both.
B00004VXF2|5.0|This album without doubt represents the zenith of Lou Reed's output, although admittedly it's not everyone's cup of tea.  I once heard a theory that it is an aural portrayal of the four seasons of the year, and it may just have something going for it, if you have another, closer listen, preferably with headphones.  MMM Part One develops a number of bright, fresh spring-like themes that repeated listening make more apparent.  These develop through MMM Part Two into warmer deeper tones, bringing forth images of summer, with some starkly conflicting themes towards the end, which presage MMM Part 3, which is strongly marked by a number of desperate aural clashes as each channel fights for supremacy.  But all too soon it's winter, indicated by MMM Part 4's more sombre, rueful tones, the repetitive rhythmic theme which this music ends with symbolising the cyclical nature of time.  Highlights must be the whole of MMM Part 3 (except for an annoying 30 seconds or so around 9:10) and the last six minutes of MMM Part 1, until just before it segues into MMM Part 2.  I've read that Hal Leonard Music are still working on the guitar tabs, one can only hope they get them out there soon.  A couple of demos or studio outtakes would have earned this CD six stars.
0316172324|2.0|This book is 50% \\"thin slicing\\", 50% lesson on stereotyping, and no real explanation on how to improve our already innate ability to thin slice. \\"Don't rush to judgement without a sufficient knowledge of the subject and don't question yourself too much if you have sufficient knowledge of the subject\\".  That's pretty much the whole book in a couple sentences.
0307346609|5.0|Outstanding and gripping.  \\"World War Z\\" has the most original mode of exposition I've encountered since reading \\"Time's Arrow\\", by Martin Amis, but don't let that stop you.  At first I was concerned that it might be dry or too episodic for plot development and a decent set of characters, but I've found that the book is filled with good guys, bad guys, heroes,  scoundrels, and most of all, human guys (and gals) trying to cope with things gone really, really bad.   <br /> <br />It was not my original plan, but I sat down to read it on a Saturday afternoon and did not quit until I reached the end, in the wee hours of Sunday morning. <br /> <br />A minor but charming detail I love is that the cover flaps and the quotes on the back do not deviate from the assertion that the text is \\"An Oral History of the Zombie War.\\" <br /> <br />I never got around to reading \\"The Zombie Survival Guide,\\" but I'm going to remedy that as soon as I can find a copy.
0451457994|5.0|This was such an amazing story!2001 A Space Odyssey is a must to read! This science fiction novel was really exiting, sometimes even putting you on the edge of your seat with much suspense! I personally loved the way it was written. The beggining was reaally good and gave out much detail for the sory's plot. The roles of the main characters are really cool and important. The events in the story want to make you read on and on till the end of the book. This book takes you to another world of science fiction. <br /> <br />This novel is crap story. This is the best science fiction story I have ever read in my life. I am telling you, Arthur C. Clark is no ordinary author. He takes science fiction to the max. This is one of the author's best written stories. The book may be a little tricky for some youngsters to read. The ending of the story is just brilliant, but I wont tell you how it ends. You should read it and find out. You would be surprised of what some of the main characters are. There re a bunch of turning points in this story, so this makes the story a lot more interesting to read. The mood of the story is what really turned me on. It is very lonely, dark, and suspenseful. I dont think many authors would create a story like that, the kind of stork that would carry out through the rest of the story. I think the climax of the story is the best part of the book. You would never think that the climax in this story cahanges as it does. You wouldnt beleive how the story ends. It is really unusual and acually really scary if you understand what is going on near the end. This book is the best.
B000H5U65C|5.0|MASTODON are a unique voice in metal music today. Stoner rock, sludge metal, whatever we must call them, all that really matters is that MASTODON Rocks. And its cooler to sing about mythological beasts these days [...]- though we can all relate to that material as well. Not a single bad song on the album. Tracks 4 thru 8 are nonstop metal ferocity. Then there's 9-12.. and 1-3. It's all good! Thick guitar riffs, spastic drums, and clever songcraft make BLOOD MOUTAIN a delight for children of all ages. And the vocals are varied enough to keep things interesting. Check out the album illustrations by singer/guitarist Brent Hinds - Cool Stuff
B00005JL78|4.0|'Minority Report' is a fascinating excursion into the future, 2054 to be exact, where pre-cognitiion is used to read the minds of the public at large and prevent the crime of murder before it occurs. Interesting concept don't you think, incarcerating someone for a crime before it's committed. However what looks at first like a error proof system, a flaw seems to appear when police officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the the pre-crime division appears as the murder suspect in one of the pre-cogs visions of the future.<br /><br />Be prepared for an entertaining adventure that boasts not only wonderful special effects, but a lot to think about as well.
0393327655|5.0|As a long-time non-believer, much of what Mr. Harris writes about resonates with my fundamental thinking on the subject of religion and faith. I found his discourse interesting and well written. There are two tests for a book of this nature. The first will be whether it will persuade anyone who thinks differently (a religous person) to question his \\"faith\\" and consider a life guided by reason and logic. The second test will be whether this book serves to motivate others who already agree with Mr. Harris and mobilizes a counter-movement against the evangelicals and fundamentalists who occupy more and more of the government seats of power in our own country. <br /> <br />I look forward to another book, possibly by Mr. Harris, but possibly not, that explores how a counter-faith movement in the US could happen without having to rely on the extreme-left liberals who are currently the only US political figures who don't claim to be guided by a mystical force. <br /> <br />Mr. Harris's main message in this book can not be overlooked. Even if we somehow fix the problems of the American theocracy, the forces of Islam *are* out to do us harm. There is no border that will protect us and we must be ready to fight for our freedom to not believe in anything but our own good nature.

I don't like how Rory quits Yale, and how her life seems to go downhill. However, I do like how Emily and Richard end up back together, and Lorelai and Luke end up back together. But overall, the first four seasons were better.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|In response to the \\"Prairie Cajun\\", I totally agree with you.  Yet the X-men films were utter disrespect to the comic/cartoon fans from da get go monami. (WHERES GAMBIT!!?) I hope they do scrap the idea for later x-men films related to these 3 and just start over with an all new cast, directors, screenwriters etc. and call it the UNCANNY X-MEN, that way there are no ties to the 1st set of movies.  <br /> <br />That way, under new management, then we could finally get characters with their REAL costumes and not excuses as to why they were never used. I mean come on, Batman & SuperMan have been wearing their costumes since before I was even born, in the movies. SuperMan was even flying (starring Chris Reeve) back in the day. And all we get is a goofy hovering, from certain characters, in the 1st two XMEN films!!  <br /> <br />Yes sadly, this film was an extreme disappointment. Personally, I feel they should have got someone with a deep passion for X-MEN, much like Sam Raimi with SpiderMan... TRUE GENIUS!!  <br /> <br />Growing up as a child this is not how I envisioned my favorite X-MEN on the big screen!! No not at all!! Its like a slap in the face.  <br /> <br />And dont forget, some years back we had the T-1000, liquid metal terminator, and those graphics for him looked better than ICEMAN!!
B000067J1H|5.0|When I first heard about this film I really wasn't interested. I thought the film was about an underground fight club. But it was more than that. This film is without a doubt one of the most stylistic and smart films I have seen, and is definetly Edward Norton's best film. Norton, who narrates the film has a dead-end job and an unfulfilling life. As he see's it, his life is one of a drab-consumer-oriented-yuppy trying to keep up with the american dream: such as acquiring as many material possessions as possible through his unrelenting purchase of consumer goods. This will make him happy right? Wrong, it only makes him despise himself and others like him all the more. There is an anti-consumerism message being played out here in Norton's pysche. And thus, an insomniac is born.<br /><br />Enter Norton's alter-ego Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who gives an equally impressive acting performace. I must admit, the film took me totally by surprise. As for the violence in the film, it is only a means to an end in telling the story. The fight club itself is not the main idea behind the film, only a vehicle for advancing the film. It's the mental breakdown of Norton, and his split personalities that I found totally original in the film, and how this is brought to a conclusion that floored me. The ending of the film is one of the best I have ever seen--and especially with the music of the Pixies blaring away as the building's are collapsing. A great film, and highly recommended. [STARS: 5+]
B00005JP87|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen in a very long time. The acting was supurb, in my opinion, and it captivated me from the very beginning. I will definately be seeing this one again and will add to my movie library at home as soon as it comes out on DVD.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Sabrina, or Bree, is working as a waitress in a Mexican restraint in LA, and is going to have a male-to-female transsexual operation next week. However, Bree learns that she has a 17-year-old son Toby whom she has not even known the presence of until then, and that he is now in jail. Bree decides to travel to NYC where she learns what Toby had been doing on the street. Without telling him the truth about her identity, Bree offers a ride back to LA for Toby, who wants to be in a porno film. <br /> <br />The topic of gender identity or transsexual is not new - see `Boys Don't Cry' - but if Bree and the film `Transamerica' are raising voices against discrimination, they do it more quietly. Bree only wants to be nice to the boy, and help him mend his ways, and as many well-intentioned parents do, Bree sometimes overreaches herself. The film's theme is more universal than its subject matter might lead you to expect. <br /> <br />Slightly downbeat `Transamerica' offers a few laughs along the way, but it basically belongs to the road movie genre that has been seen in the past films many times. On the way to their destination, Bree and Toby meet people, come to understand each other, and themselves too, sadder and wiser than before. The format is surely predictable, including such familiar items as young hitchhiker, crowded bar, truck driver, and reunion with family, but it works because of Felicity Huffman's excellent portrait of Bree, and the authentic acting from Kevin Zegers as a troubled teenager. <br /> <br />Capable supporting actors such as Fionnula Flanagan, Burt Young, Graham Greene, and Elizabeth Pena appear, but the segment of Fionnula Flanagan and Burt Young playing Bree's parents look a little out of place after watching the film's slower first half depicting the quiet and clever exchange of words between Bree and Toby. Fionnula Flanagan's over-the-top acting as Bree's controlling mother might impress you (like a character you can see in a sit-com), but not inthe same way as the off-beat rhythm of earnestness in Felicity Huffman's character, which makes her more human and likable without patronizing.   <br /> <br />I say this because `Transamerica' offers a curiously pleasant experience of watching a unique subject matter treated with orthodox approach. The film deals with sexuality, but it is not exactly about sexuality itself. The film succeeds because it refuses to be shocking or campy. It is not only about Bree and Toby; it is about you and me.

B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Ah, the power of sex, and sexual images and thoughts, tawdry or otherwise. For some reason, I respond to seeing SS on the SS (silver screen) no matter how bad the script. I even liked her in \\"Casino\\" and \\"Basic Instinct 2\\". Of course, \\"Basic Instinct\\" is the Grail of SS movies. This one has many flaws, but it was never intended to be a Turner Classic Movie. As mere entertainment which offers a break from the often heart-breaking daily news, \\"Sliver\\" is not as bad as the critics said.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Perhaps I am a little to liberal with my stars these days, but I think that Iron Maidens newest disc MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH holds up extremely well against the cannon of Maiden material from years past. The band is in full form here, from start to finish and with their hey day now almost twenty years in the past, Maiden have dropped an old school heavy metal bomb! I like it.<br /><br />Of course, I liked the previous two efforts as well, Wicker Man and Dance Of Death, but in those two Iron Maiden had taken a milder approach. The previous two were more progressive it seemed than metal. MATTER takes the band back to their way out, melodic metal days of yore. If one didn't know any better, I bet I could convince them that this album was released between Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son. Of course we all know that this isn't true. This album was released in 2006, yet it kicks! MAY-DEN!<br /><br />Bruce's singing flows completely naturally, and does not sound the least bit forced. The band jams out on every single track, with less electronics, and more guitars. ROCKIN!<br /><br />My buddy Dizzy, who gave me this disc, pointed out the fact though that there are too many intro's. After listening a few times I have to agree. Pretty much every song has an intro via Steve Harris, that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the song. Think back to when Sabbath did N.I.B and there was that lengthy bass solo at the beggining that just fades out and then the real song starts. Every song here has one of those, but it didn't really bother me too much. I think the disc is a worthy Maiden release, and I can't wait to see them perform this stuff live amidst other Maiden classics!

B000EGDAI4|5.0|The brilliance of this album has been stated many times by people with more jazz knowledge than me.  However I thought I should echo what the other reviewer states here: there are some minor problems with this disc.  Specifically, there is a flutter on the 4th track \\"Moritat.\\"  I thought I heard it 3-4 different times.  It doesn't ruin the music, but you might be tempted to return the disc.  The RVG series is stellar so I'm assuming it's a problem with the masters.  If that's not the problem then it may be in the manufacturing.  Mildly disappointing... <br /> <br />I would like to put in a quick mention of the genius of Max Roach.  His technique on the ride cymbal is revolutionary.  I could write an essay on it myself!  All in all, this is one of my all-time favorite jazz albums.
B000H305U0|3.0|So I'm not really a JT fan at all, but some critics I respect recommended this one, so I thought I'd check it out.  Basically, the whole thing was Prince-inspired (to put it mildly - I wouldn't be surprised to learn that JT changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol).  The sound and bumpin' groove is actually quite good in general, as are some of the vocal tracks, and the (former?) wimpy-@$$ boybander uses the word M&*(erF^&*er - on those merits, the album earns its three-star rating.  The problems though, are that he has neglected the existance of acoustic instruments (just about every instrument track on the album is electronically synthesized), the lyrics are completely uninspiring, and there is way too much muddy electronica for anything this side of Xiu Xiu (google em).  He alludes to James Brown, on the lead single \\"SexyBack\\" but obviously didn't listen too closely - the words \\"take it to the bridge\\" come 32 seconds into the song, which basically defines JT as the Anti-Brown.  I understand he's trying to be a 'bad boy' and be a 'sex symbol,' but even Prince and Brown would call him over the line on this one (maybe JT could give those two some more listens).  Tone it down a little, throw in a dash of symbolism, scrub out the mud (and that frickin' hyena sounding thing on \\"My Love\\"!!!), and u have a good album.  Sadly, it doesn't have those things...
B000H7JD4K|3.0|The first star is a given.  It's Iron Maiden.  Their contribution to the metal genre is massive.  I can give the album one star before even listening. <br /> <br />The second star is props.  The band is 27 years old with almost all its original members and still making an attempt to put out new music.  They continue to ignore popular trends and stay true to their style.  And despite little promotion, they're selling out shows. <br /> <br />Star #3 is when I begin to discus the content of this album.  Bruce still sounds great and although 3 different guitar players is probably overkill in the studio, the MELODIC instrumentation is great.  These guys can still shred with the best of them.  Steve Harris is a rock.  There's never any reason to doubt his playing ability. <br /> <br />But 3 stars is where it ends.   <br /> <br />Iron Maiden's music is formulaic, all fans know this, and to a certain extent we count on it.  But on this album it seems like EVERY song is cut from a single source.  Virtually all the songs are in the same key, begin with a slow into, and the I-VI-VII-I chord progression gets old quickly. <br /> <br />But even if the songwriting is a bit boring, the album would have still gotten four stars from me if it weren't for THE AWEFULL PRODUCTION AND SLOPPY DRUMMING!   <br /> <br />I read another review on Amazon asking, \\"Please bring back Martin Birch\\"...I couldn't agree more.  I implore everyone to go back and listen to the POWERSLAVE album from a production standpoint.  All the instruments are crisp and clean and the vocals are strong.  POWERSLAVE is a masterpiece of metal.  One would think that with all of the technological advances in musical recording in the 20 years since POWERSLAVE, Maiden would have no trouble putting out a polished, great-sounding album.  Unfortunately, the recording is a sludgy, mangled, over-gained mess.  Instruments and vocals get lost in the mix and the drums regularly peak out.  This might be a good artistic approach for Queens of the Stone Age, but not Iron Maiden! <br /> <br />Finally, let's talk about Nicko.  I love Nicko, but ever since Brave New World you have to admit that his better years are behind him.  Check out Nicko's chops on Where Eagles Dare (PIECE OF MIND) or Losfer Words (POWERSLAVE).  His drumming on this album is nowhere near the tightness of Maiden's \\"golden\\" period.  The up-tempo parts feel heavy, like the band is dragging extra weight around.  And don't even get me started on the sloppy, abrupt, mid-song tempo changes!  I've seen Maiden live a number of times and Nicko is usually spot-on, so it's possible that to a certain extent the poor production detracts from his performance on the record.  But now we're splitting hairs. <br /> <br />To sum it up, BRAVE NEW WORLD was a decent effort but the two albums since then have been disappointments.  Regrettably, I don't think the band will ever be able to recapture the spark of their glory days, but I'm glad their still around.  They are the godfathers.
6302902010|5.0|Several other users have said everything I'm going to, but their opinions may get lost amongst the overwhelming majority of comments lamenting the unavailability of the 1959 film version of \\"Porgy & Bess\\".  Let's just get some of the basic facts straight again.<br /><br />The \\"original\\" production of \\"Porgy & Bess\\" as an opera took place in 1935 on stage.  Even this premiere presentation was abridged, both to conform to the conventions of Broadway (where it was originally presented), and to spare the voices of the leads, particularly Porgy (which is why the \\"Buzzard Song\\" was cut from the first production).<br /><br />In a sense, the first time the opera was presented as Gershwin truly envisioned it was by the Houston Grand Opera in 1976, with the full score restored, as well as the recitative passages which were frequently changed to spoken dialogue in earlier productions.<br /><br />The film version was an aberration-- I've never seen it, but have read quite a bit about it, and it seems clear that this version was intended as more of a musical than an opera.  Also, most of the parts were dubbed by other singers, so those who complain about about this issue on the current DVD release of the Glyndebourne production should bear that in mind.<br /><br />The Gershwin estate *is* responsible for squashing any trace of the PReminger film, which I think is a shame if only for reasons of artistic free speech, but the censorship becomes more understandable when you see how many Amazon.com users have posted comments that demonstrate the 1959 film is, to a large degree, what the public sees as the true \\"Porgy & Bess\\".  And this is after almost 50 years of supressing the film from public view!<br /><br />OK, so all the above said, what about the Glyndebourne DVD?  I think it's exceptionally well done, but share some of the reservations noted by others:  the lip synching is distractingly off at points (particularly if you're watching on a large screen TV); I find the sound mixing occassionally off, sometimes drowning out the vocal lines.<br /><br />But these are minor quibbles.  I can't imagine a true operatic trreatment as a film.  I can't even think of a precedent.  It's taken for granted that cinematic presentations of Shakespeare will be abridged, rearrange, and reinterpreted, and the same holds true for film treatments of opera.  The forms just don't naturally jell.<br /><br />Television can present opera as opera, with just enough opening up of the action to prevent the story from feeling static or stagebound.  And I think Trevor Nunn has done just this, with some creative and original interpretations of his own.  Whether you like the change he's made to the ending or not, I think you have to admire the creativity behind it.  It's certainly not exploitative.  At worst, it's a bit sentimental.  I find it inspiring, in a metaphorical way.  I don't think the miracle is meant to be taken quite literally.<br /><br />The performances are uniformally excellent, powerful and dignified.  I was personally most impressed by Cynthia Haymon as Bess, who is really the only character to undergo a major transformation through the course of the story.  She is believable, earthily beatiful, and the sympathy you feel for her intensifies the heartbreaking tragedy of her fate.<br /><br />Those who have complained about the acting performances simply don't understand that opera acting is generally stylized, similarly to silent film acting.  There's also an unfortunate history of only semi-competent acting in the opera world, but I can't point to a single weak link in the cast of this DVD production.<br /><br />This is a creative, faithful adaptation for television of the opera as it was intended to be seen by Gershwin himself.  The 1959 film should be available for contemporary evaluation, but it's simply unfair to knock this wonderful 1993 prodcution on the basis of dimly nostalgic memories of the lost Preminger film.  I do wish the sound were a bit better, and that the lip synching was better matched to the dubbed vocals, but these are intellectual, trivial criticisms of what I find to be a musically and emotionally powerful presentation of Gershwin's masterpiece.sh the sound were a bit better, and that the lip synching was better matched to the dubbed vocals, but these are intellectual, trivial criticisms of what I find to be a musically and emotionally powerful presentation of Gershwin's masterpiece.

Stone Sour's 2006 disk is melodic hard rock, the singing is clear and there are songs on the disk that even my wife can listen to.<br /><br />So I say to myself, maybe I need to give Slipknot another listen. Clearly I must have a mistaken impression of Slipknot if Corey Taylor and James Root's talent ring out so clear in Stone Sour. If Stone Sour is so good, can Slipknot really be that bad? YES!<br /><br />If you're a more traditional Metal fan, Slipknot is unlistenable and Disasterpieces is unwatchable. Disasterpieces could not be more appropriately named.<br /><br />Slipknot is a special breed of Metal, folks. If you're into the chaos that the likes of Unearth, Lamb of God and Cannibal Corpse put out then Slipknot and Disasterpieces are right up your alley.<br /><br />If you like Iron Maiden, Disturbed or Stone Sour, Slipknot is nothing like them. Slipknot's music is all over the place. You can't understand the lyrics. It's total, absolute mayhem.<br /><br />The DVD is just as chaotic as the music. You can't count to 2 before the shot changes. Strobe induced epileptics stay away!<br /><br />There are guys in Slipknot that you wonder what they even do. One guy stands in front of and climbs on some giant kettle drums. But you never really hear them being played even when they show him playing them.<br /><br />Joey Jordison's drumming was amazingly fast and precise. But it's wasted behind music that is incomprehensible.<br /><br />Slipknot is a freakshow by design for fans looking for a hard-core spectacle...not someone looking for music.
0783116934|4.0|Citizen X (Chris Gerolmo, 1995)<br /><br />Gerolmo, who wrote Mississippi Burning, gets behind the camera for this one, and turns out a surprisingly good piece of work for a straight-to-cable drama in the mid-nineties. Ostensibly the story of the crimes and capture of Andrei Chikatilo (Hollywoodland's Jeffrey DeMunn), Soviet Russia's only admitted serial killer, it can't help but also be a scathing criticism of Soviet bureaucracy.<br /><br />Burakov (The Crying Game's Stephen Rea), a medical examiner, is put in charge of the case by Col. Fetisov (Donald Sutherland), one of the local politicos. It's obvious from this move alone that Fetisov is not going to be your typical bureaucrat, though Burakiv and Fetisov run up against all manner of those-- most notably Bondarchuk (prolific character actor Joss Ackland, recently seen in Asylum), the mayor of the town at the center of the region where the crimes are being committed. Gerolmo slants the film towards the interpretation that Chikatilo-- who was allowed to roam unchecked for almost a decade-- stayed free purely as the result of Soviet incompetence, and that Burakov was the only guy who actually got it. Which all may be true, but comes off as a bit heavy-handed at times. When it doesn't-- in particular, a lovely scene at the very end of the film where Burakov repeats a number of Fetisov's own admonitions back to him-- it works wonderfully. When it does, the film jars.<br /><br />What does work, from beginning to end, is the camerawork, and everything encompassed in that term. There are some fantastically-blocked shots in this film, and Gerolmo knows how to get the top mileage possible out of Chikatilo's crimes without getting too bloody; Gerolmo uses one repeated shot to denote each of Chikatilo's murders that we see, then varies little details about it. He goes about it in such a way that some of those differences are shocking, at least momentarily, and always creepily effective.<br /><br />A very good serial-killer film. Worth checking out. *** ½l-killer film. Worth checking out. *** ½
B000FQJAIW|2.0|George Lucas has already stated that \\"A hundred years from now, the only version of Star Wars that anyone will remember will be the special edition DVD versions\\". Mr. Lucas feels that the original versions are \\"unfinished drafts and artifacts\\". Most original fans consider the original versions as definative releases.     When you purchase this DVD you're actually buying the NEW (special edition) version of the film. The original version is an \\"extra\\" or \\"bonus\\". That's why no effort was put into restoring the original film. It's included here as a simple DVD extra, or as George Lucas would say, an \\"artifact\\" from the past.    George Lucas has NEVER FINISHED tinkering with Star Wars. Just before the release of the film in 1977 he changed the entire opening crawl and cut several characters from the film entirely. A famous quote from an ILM worker way back in 1977 was that \\"George Lucas would probably still be in the projection booth (at the premiere) editing and changing the film\\".    Don't get me wrong, George Lucas had every right to enhance the special effects in Star Wars. If a film relies heavily on special FX it's only natural that it may not age well as technology advances. If done correctly, an FX revamping can add new life to a film that has become dated. SuperMan the motion picture comes to mind as a film in serious need of FX revamping, especially near the end (the town flood, etc.).    Those who claim that a director should NEVER alter a classic film in ANY way are missing the point. As far as I'm concerned they can do whatever they like AS LONG AS the \\"new altered version\\" is NOT the only version available and being PUSHED as a \\"replacement\\" for the original. If the original version has been given the proper treatment that a classic film deserves (which hasn't happened with star wars) then by all means have fun to your hearts content with special \\"revamped\\" editions.    Fans of Star Wars have always wanted one simple thing, to have MORE of the classic film that they love. This means a completely RESTORED original version with an added bonus of ALL of the missing and cut scenes. Those scenes could be included as extras or perhaps with an OPTION to view them as an integrated part of the film. That's really not too much to ask, but instead of getting \\"MORE\\" of Star Wars, the fans ended up with LESS! The OVER USE of \\"revamped FX\\" did more to weaken the film than it did to enhance it. Again, I wouldn't mind the \\"new\\" versions AT ALL if the ORIGINAL VERSIONS were already RESTORED, AVAILABLE and treated with the respect that they deserve!    It's nice to finally see the original films on DVD. But the fact that they're a \\"bonus artifact\\" without proper restoration is an insult to original fans and to the film itself.    P.S.    The \\"other\\" ORIGINAL \\"crawl\\" (cut just prior to the films release):     \\"It is a period of CIVIL WAR in the galaxy. A brave Alliance of UNDERGROUND FREEDOM FIGHTERS has challenged the tyranny and oppression of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE. To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new BATTLE STATION. Powerful enough to destroy an entire planet, its COMPLETION will spell CERTAIN DOOM for the champions of freedom. Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, REBEL SPACESHIPS have won their first victory in a battle with the powerful IMPERIAL STARFLEET. The Empire fears that ANOTHER defeat could bring a THOUSAND MORE solar systems into the rebellion, and IMPERIAL CONTROL over the galaxy would be LOST FOREVER.\\"    An -\\"OPTION\\"- to view the film with this opening would make a great \\"bonus\\" on a truly revamped \\"classic\\" edition of Star Wars. Along with the Biggs Darklighter scenes, etc.     -JM
0452285186|4.0|Andy Riley, The Book of Bunny Suicides (Plume, 2003)<br /><br />This is the kind of book that was popular in the eighties and seems to have faded into obscurity since-- one guy makes a bunch of silly drawings, which then get released in a very short, rather wide book (Garfield and Far Side comics were often released in the same manner), but the artist hasn't got the benefit of a big syndicated strip in a newspaper. 101 Uses for a Dead Cat is probably the most popular of them ever.<br /><br />Well, move over, lifeless felines, because So Graham Norton writer Andy Riley is here with The Book of Bunny Suicides. And it is hysterical. There were some that actually had me unable to breathe for a few seconds. Not that they're all that brilliant, or the book would have to come with a warning label, but there's more than enough funny here to justify the purchase price. Andy Riley is a very, very sick individual, and he has allowed one particular facet of his illness to be released upon the unsuspecting masses. Take advantage. ****
B00003CWL6|5.0|From the opening moments of the movie, we know Lester Burnham is going to die; we just do not know the specifics, nor do we realize how little the knowledge of his demise will detract from our enjoyment of the film leading up to this final act. Things appear to be perfectly fine in the Burnham household: Lester and Carolyn are both gainfully employed, have a large, beautiful house in suburbia, drive luxury automobiles and their healthy, robust teenaged daughter is a cheerleader on the high school squad. Yet, every seasoned filmgoer knows to never trust appearances. Carolyn's career as a real estate agent isn't going well, so she's hoping that sleeping with the enormously successful real estate king will help rub off some of his fortune. Lester, on the other hand, doesn't have a career; he has a job. In fact, he has had the same job with the same employer for several years. The distinction between \\"career\\" and \\"job\\" is vitally important to those of us who merely have a \\"job.\\" Sure, it might pay reasonably well, though not necessarily. A \\"job,\\" however, is not something we envision ourselves doing for the rest of our lives and it is certainly not how we define ourselves. In fact, we would rather not respond when asked what we do for a living. It simply does not matter to us. What is worse, Lester does not have a sense of identity. \\"That's okay. I wouldn't remember me either,\\" he responds when one of his wife's acquaintances mistakenly thinks they are meeting for the first time. Perhaps not many people can identify with this, though I certainly can. Lester and I are equally unremarkable, failing to make an impression on most people we meet. Maybe at one point in the past, or even still today deep down, we want to remain anonymous. It does have its advantages at times. It is often frustrating or embarrassing, however, and we realize this. Sometimes when people are indistinct, yet want to be noticed, they resort to drastic tactics. This is how murder sprees happen. But I digress. Rather than murder people, Lester nonetheless does take radical measures. With an unloving wife and a daughter who finds him an embarrassment, he chooses to quit everything in an effort to start over. In a quest to redefine himself, he returns to life the way it was before he was supposed to define himself. He was much more comfortable then. \\"I want the job with the least amount of responsibility,\\" he tells the teenaged manager of the fast food restaurant at which he applies for a job. Few responsibilities, not accountable to anyone and no one accountable to him; hanging out, lifting weights and smoking pot; this is life the way it was meant to be. Unfortunately for Lester, the young man (Wes Bentley) supplying him with weed happens to have an authoritarian, unenlightened father (Chris Cooper) with a particularly strong homophobic streak.

B00005U8EM|5.0|This film has its place as a \\"Ground Breaking\\" idea.  It's comedy is will placed, subtle and genuinely funny.<br /><br />Some films, such as Star Trek, are trying to come up with warped ideas 100% of the time.  Good as food-for-thought, but it can get tedious towards the end of a series.<br /><br />I have truly enjoyed watching Groundhog Day for the 2nd time, which is probably enough for any film - otherwise it starts to become a Groundhog Day of our own.<br /><br />After the first time I came away with the feeling that the whole purpose was for our hero to win a bedroom conquest.  On second thoughts it was not so gratuitous (mainly because it isn't overdone).  But it still seems strange that it is the aim of the whole plotline.  Why can't they simply fall in love and then Groundhog Day be over?
079073804X|5.0|This is my favorite horror film for several reasons, though primarily because it is the only film to have truly frightened me. Granted, I first saw it when I was about ten years old, but it seemed very evil at the time. A large studio budget allows for a first rate production from top notch talent, which lends credibility and effectiveness to the film. In order to be effective, it is essential that a movie dealing with a subject such as supernatural phenomena be earnest and believable because if any single facet is done less than professionally, the viewer loses respect for it. Trust me, I believed the first time I saw this. Adapted by William Peter Blatty from his own novel, the film concerns a young priest, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller). As his faith wanes, he is assigned to investigate odd goings on within the MacNeil household. It doesn't take long for Father Karras to come to the conclusion that it would behoove him to invite the wiser, more experienced Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) to the house in order to share his appraisal of the situation. By this point, the viewer is scared enough to deem this a wise decision on the part of Father Karras. I find the film unnerving because we never really know what the demon is thinking, what motivates it or how it will react to a given stimulus. It is also a compelling film because a higher power for good is invoked to combat the evil. While the film contains some fine performances, the one that stands out among them is Linda Blair's. She certainly earned the nomination she received for best actress in a supporting role, though she did not deserve all the ensuing adverse repercussions from appearing in the film. Mike Oldfield's \\"Tubular Bells\\" provides a suitably eerie soundtrack for the film as well. Ultimately, one's own appreciation for the film and the extent to which one finds it frightening will likely depend on one's own faith. When one is young and has yet to form one's own viewpoints concerning faith or a belief system, the film can be quite terrifying. However, when one is older and has confirmed one's beliefs, the film is likely only to frighten those of the Christian, or possibly only Catholic, faiths. Why is it demons can only be exorcised by Catholic priests? Why not an imam, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk? This film has been popular among people of the Catholic and even Christian faiths, though it is understandable why it might not appeal to those of other faiths. I no longer find the film scary, which could be attributed to one or more of the following: I am now thirty-five years young and no longer frighten easily; I have seen it several times, so its impact on me has diminished; or, I am not of the Christian faith. Regardless, this film stands well above most other horror films and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror film. Chances are pretty high that you will find it chilling.elief system, the film can be quite terrifying.

B000002HH9|5.0|Man oh man oh man; I cannot fathom these 1 star reviews by people.  There must be SOMETHING they just DON'T get about this album, because it's brilliant.  I won't go into specifics, but let me just say that I own every single Cure album and song ever released, from Three Imaginary Boys in '79 to Self-Titled in '04, along with the Join the Dots (B-Sides and Rarities) release in '04.  In any case, my point is that I know ALL Cure.  Everything.  Many fans will compare this to other Cure releases such as \\"Disintegration\\" or \\"Pornography\\" or \\"Faith\\" or \\"Wish\\" and diss the heck out of it...just seems bizarre and strange to me.  This album has so many eclectic features and and an incredible range of diversity, yet it is still held together by all things Cure.  The songs are downright beautiful.  For people to call this slosh and self-indulgent is just plain ignorant.  To attack the lyrical content is downright immature.  So what if he's singing about cheating?  Each song is unique with a wide array of themes.  Pay no regard to the bad reviews.  You can trust me as someone who has everything The Cure has released that this is a more-than-worthy addition to your collection.  I actually prefer the second half of the disc more than the first, but still love the first half as well.  Do it up and treat your ears to a real work of art.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I wish the rating scale went up to 10 stars because I'd enthusiastically give them all to Sin City. I've watched it a dozen times and am still blown away by the dialog and gritty throwback feeling it evokes of the old 30's and 40's hard-drinking, hard-fighting tough guys. It actually inspired me to sit down the night I saw it, and jot down the outline for a Film Noir type novel that's now moved to my front burner after completion of my third novel in my McCarthy Mystery series. I just hope I can write something half as compelling as Sin City.<br /><br />The film makes no apology for the raw lust and violence and yet never falls into campy self-parody.<br /><br />But it's the film-work, the use of light and shadow and especially color that really blows you away. Yellow for the corrupt, cowardly blood of the pederast villain. Masterful!<br /><br />If you haven't seen Sin City, give your senses a treat and buy the DVD.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed!

1571200851|4.0|This book gave me some good ideas for adding something different to my quilts.  At first glance the instructions appear simple but some of the photos and diagrams need to be studied quite carefully to achieve the desired result.  I found practising with paper first, on some flowers, helpful as the paper holds it's fold.  However that is a disadvantage with other flowers. Experimentation is probably the way to go.  Some flowers would not be pratical on quilts that require washing.
0060872675|4.0|I think some of the reviewers who didn't think this was a good child's book probably didn't actually read it to a child.  My granddaughter (4) wanted it read over and over.  The picture of the \\"scary\\" troll was a perfect chance to explain that not everyone who looks scary is a bad guy, that troll is Sgt. Detritus who is a very good guy.  After I told her that, she explained it to her cousin, her father, and one of my dogs.   <br /> <br />It is true that there is more going on than what a small child sees.  But the child does see a Daddy reading a story to his little boy and loves the pictures and the silliness, and the adult can enjoy Sam Vimes attempt to make the \\"book within a book\\" more appropriate for a city boy and can appreciate that none of it matters.  That what matters is that Sam Vimes, whose life is so incredibly busy that he seldom gets enought to eat or sleep, comes home every night at six, and reads \\"Where's My Cow?\\" to his son.
0316168815|4.0|This past summer I was urged by my peers to choose Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" as one of my summer reads.  I was \\"warned\\" that it was a very depressing book, and I was eager to find out exactly why for myself.  The fact that the book starts out with the rape and murder of a young girl was very startling.  At the same time, I thought this was a very refreshing and creative technique.  I enjoyed the fact that rather than leading up to a tragedy, this novel shows what happens to those who are forced to endure a tragedy.  The constant contrast between the after life and life on earth presented the idea that it's never really over and that someone who cares about you is always watching over you.  This novel does a wonderful job in exploring the human condition and following a family that both falls apart and is brought back together by a tragedy.  Another positive aspect of this book is that it is extremely easy to relate to.  Everyone knows what it is like to deal with some sort of tragedy and it was nice to see an author eloquently capture those emotions and feelings on the pages within this novel.  Overall, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a wonderful novel that shows us that we all deal with tragedies and we all fall down, but we are all capable of getting back up.
B00030590I|3.0|I suppose I can't complain about a Chinese nationalist movie.  After all, we have many ourselves, some of which are considered true classics (e.g., High Noon; Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) and some are kitschy classics (e.g., Red Dawn).<br /><br />However, I have to note that Tibet and Formosa were not part of this first king's \\"One China\\" policy.  I also note that according to one source, \\"The wars [during the warring states period] that occurred were not generally ones due to diplomatic or territorial frictions among the seven states but instead were wars stemming from one state attempting to conquer and control all of the states. In other words, the formation of the empire came not as a result of anarchy but as a result of greed and drive for power.\\"<br /><br />Leave aside its politics for a second, the movie was too disjointed and too iconic.  By disjointed I mean changes in time, place, scene and from reality to fantasy without proper transition.  Maybe my difficulties come from the movie being in another language and from another cultural perspective.  By \\"too iconic\\" I mean each character had superhuman power, clarity or judgment when the film supposedly was about actual historical characters.  Moreover, the film's visual and iconic nature allows it to be easily parodied and in fact it and \\"Crouching Tiger\\" have been parodied by the movie industry itself, with the faux-Chinese film that they play at the beginning of the movie to instruct patrons to turn off their cell phones.  If you create an epic that's easily parodied, maybe there's a flaw in your epic.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|Of all the movies released on DVD, this is a gem that's long been on my list to acquire.  And just in time!  My sorry VHS copy was wearing out. <br /> <br />I was in my early 20's when this film was originally released, being young, idealistic, wanting to challenge everything.  It was easy to get caught up in the romance of the film -- the struggle with politics, both sexual and social.  But this film has more staying power than most other early 1980's film releases.  I found it to be Beatty's best effort and well deserving of the film awards it garnered. <br /> <br />Be forewarned.  It helps if you have some understanding of world events during that era as well as knowledge of the movers and shakers of that period.  My favorite witness -- Henry Miller!  The quintessential \\"sponge\\".
B000FVQYYK|4.0|This is an amazing album. It's like Radiohead meets Coldplay with a smattering of Queen (but only a smattering) and that one-hit wonder from a few years ago, Fastball... all of these but with some real guts behind it. The only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars is because whoever mastered this album should be drawn and quartered. There is no headroom whatsoever which can overpower the wonderfully bright vocals. However, I'm willing to overlook this simply because of the power of this album. My favorite songs... well, I like all of them. They've all got that Muse flavour that no matter what the tone is, uniquely sounds like them.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I saw both the 1989 and the 1994 concerts and while I was not among the fortunate group who got to see Dark Side in its entirety, the Division Bell concert was FAR superior to the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, which was documented by the Distant Sound of Thunder video. <br /> <br />Both concerts were true religious experiences. I have never witnessed anything before or since quite so magnificent. <br /> <br />As to those who decry this final iteration of Pink Floyd, as somehow \\"less than\\" without Roger Waters, I can only say \\"sour grapes\\". Yes, Waters was, and is, a brilliant writer, but his work became increasingly cynical and filled with despair. To label Gilmour's songwriting as \\"meaningless tripe\\", is only to say one prefers cynicism and despair over hope and altruism. Gilmour's \\"On the Turning Away\\" is a beautiful anthem to hope and one of the most powerful guitar solos in the Floydian repetoire.  <br /> <br />Having said all of this, I couldn't help but get excited at the Live 8 reunion of the Floyds, and despite Waters' sometimes off key singing, it was a real treat to see them all onstage together, with the hope of one last \\"reconcillation\\" tour forthcoming. Alas, it is not to be. PULSE stands as a testament to the musical genius of all these men, and is a MUST own for any true Pink Floyd fan.   <br /> <br />Debate the Waters or non-Waters Floyd all you want, but for me, it will always be Gilmour's ethereal guitar work that defined the music of Pink Floyd.

0618680004|1.0|I suppose this review is all in vain, since, after all, I am a just one voice among 713 others (and counting), but here goes nothing:    While I suppose critical discussion of religion is somewhat lacking in contemporary ages, what Scientist-turned-know-it-all Richard Dawkins offers up is a vociferous screed, resorting not to logic and clarity of thought, but to rhetorical clichés, paternalistic condescension, invocations of cultural icons (why should I care what Jefferson or Franklin thought about the church?  I am not a member of the cult of the Founding Fathers...), and the most monumental straw-man argument I have ever seen launched - against \\"God\\" no less (whomever that might be...).    There are so many ways to respond, and I promised myself I would be brief.  There are four lines of argument that Dawkins makes in attacking \\"God\\": he attacks particular cultural icons that we come to call deities, like the Yahweh of the old testament Jews and Allah (and, Dawkins seems to have overlooked Zeus, Gaia, Odin, and who knows how many other culture-specific personifications of Big-Fundamental-Cosmic-Forces people have imagined and invented); he attacks the idea of belief itself; he attacks (or at least tries to) philosophical arguments in defense of \\"god\\" and he attacks the specific cultural dogmas that are associated with the culture-specific personifications referenced above (such as the ideas of Noah's flood, garden of Eden... although he skipped over the house on top Mt. Olympus for some reason).      The problem with Dawkins' attack on specific cultural icons such as Yahweh and Allah is just embarrassing and a bit silly.  Does Dawkins really believe that sophisticated, intelligent folks in 2007 who have the money, time, and educational levels to read his book think the Yahweh of the Old Testament is anything but a sometimes strange deity?  He might as well be attacking the absurdities of Zeus and his gang atop Mt. Olympus.  Mark that down as an argument sent to the wrong audience.  But to attack any particular culture-specific deity icon is not to attack God.  It is to attack someone's idea of God.  Is the God of Whitehead and Hartshorne also as psychotic and objectionable to Dawkins?  Does a sound criticism of communism or fascism convince anyone that we shouldn't have government at all?  The problem is, Dawkins and others sit around using this word \\"God\\" as if we all know and agree on the meaning - the presupposition that is fundamental to Dawkins' arguments.  The same could be said of Dawkins' attack on the supposed absurdities of the Bible.  No serious, intelligent, educated Christians are out there wringing their hands whether to believe that the universe exploded in a big bang or was made by Yahweh in 6 days.  Dawkins spends an awful long time attacking Creationism, and assumes that Creationism is somehow a fundamental belief of all Christians.  To quote the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is as official a statement of what Catholics believe as any: \\"283 The question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers.\\"  In other words, God bless the scientists (when they are doing science, not theology). (OK, granted, the Church uses the word \\"Creator\\" but that is just a plug for the idea that the Church believes that if the universe is the object of the ver \\"to create\\" there must also be a subject to the verb.  It does not mean that you must accept the whole package of 6-day light from darkness, man made whole and complete and woman to accompany him...     Then there is Dawkins' attack on specific religions.  More power tohim, I say.  What we need is more critical discussion of religion from within religion itself.   I think there are people in this world today who claim to be Christians but who are doing harm to Christianity.  Somehow, out of fear of breaking some sort of \\"I'm OK, You're ok\\" taboo we Christians refrain from debating what it means to be a Christian any more and we leave it up to those boring Atheists to criticize those we oppose (and criticize us in the process).  But to show that any particular religion is silly or wrong hardly fulfills the promise of the book's title - that God itself is s delusion.     Finally, there is Dawkins' attack on belief itself, the idea that belief is foolishness, a delusion.  Here is where Dawkins emerges as the theological equivalent of an anarchist: all government is bad government, all belief that is not scientific is bad.  In response, I again resort to the Catechism of Catholicism: \\"2293 Basic scientific research, as well as applied research, is a significant expression of man's dominion over creation. Science and technology are precious resources when placed at the service of man and promote his integral development for the benefit of all. By themselves however they cannot disclose the meaning of existence and of human progress. Science and technology are ordered to man, from whom they take their origin and development; hence they find in the person and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and awareness of their limits.\\"  Science cannot replace belief about moral existence and progress - rather, scientists take to their work the beliefs they already have formed.  Science itself doesn't provide a moral compass.  For that, you need to go into philosophy, which is a terrain upon which Dawkins is not very well-prepared to walk compared to many of us with less-scientific, more-humanist backgrounds.

6305181810|2.0|I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and \\"must watch\\". That is how good it is.
B000E6UWE4|4.0|I agree with most of the reviews, here, that complained about the writing style in this book.  I almost gave up at least a dozen times while reading. <br /> <br />But, I stuck with it, and around page 224 (out of 488), I was finally starting to enjoy it.  And, it got progressively better from there. <br /> <br />The first of the book is a frustrating CHORE to get through.  You're never given a chance to figure out what's going on nor to become familiar with the characters nor surroundings. <br /> <br />It's like trying to see what a person looks like when you're shown a quick flash of an ear, then another quick flash of an eye, then a nose, a chin, the other eye, the back of the head, the other ear.  It's just too hard and not fun. <br /> <br />The scenes jumped around from character to character and place to place within a few pages of each other (sometimes just 2 or 3).  I couldn't keep track, and there was no way of getting to know who these people were. I couldn't figure out why I was following their story. <br /> <br />And, as was stated in another review, the author has a terrible habit of throwing out names of cities, races, and characters without even telling you what the name refers to.  For example, a character walks into a common room of an inn and sees a \\"Barghast\\".  Well, I couldn't tell if that was a job title, a military rank, a resident of a city, or a race (turns out it's a race, but that's not explained until MANY pages later).  The author throws out city names left and right as if they should already be familiar to us. <br /> <br />I expect if I were to re-read the first 224 pages I'd probably enjoy it because I now understand who these people are and what the various places are.  But, I'm not going to.  No thanks. <br /> <br />Anyway, finally at page 224, the story began to stabalize and I could follow it.  And, while I agree with another reviewer that the author is stingy with insights into the characters' mindset (and physical looks, for that matter), I DID find myself caring about the main characters. <br /> <br />And, unlike another reviewer, I thought it was somewhat realistic to not have an absolute good side and an absolute bad side.  Everyone seemed to be a little right and a little wrong. <br /> <br />I'm going to read the next in the series and HOPE that the author has figured out how to grab the reader much earlier in the book.
B00005JPFB|4.0|I couldn't agree more with the first review. I loved the books and how exited was I to find out that my yearly trip to Madrid (coolest city in Europe) meant I could see the movie I was waiting for over a year now !  <br /> <br />I loved it - however, too many battle scenes, not enough information on who, why and what and yes why is Angelica not blond ?? The end I found especially annoying... Viggo of course was fabulous - as always ;-) <br /> <br />Well worth seeing but, reading the books first is a must. <br />Manuela Rhea

0393327655|2.0|The book's jacket says that Sam Harris is a doctoral candidate in neuroscience. Unfortunately, there is no neuroscience in the book. There is no attempt to explain how faith and religion could have resulted from evolution, how faith affects the brain, or how it relates to human cognitive abilities or limitations. <br /> <br />Instead, we have a rant against religion based on philosophy that was old 100 years ago. This book consists of nothing but a series of assertions. Some of these assertions aren't even true. For example, Harris says that it's self-evident that ordinary people do not commit atrocities unless they are motivated by religious faith. That is not true - and anyone with a background in neuroscience or psychology should know that. The Stanley Milgram experiments in the 1970s proved that nearly 90 percent of people will torture and kill another human being as long as they're given orders to do so by an authority figure (in the experiment, the authority figure was a psychologist, not a priest). In another portion of the book, Harris also says that Buddhism is a better religion than Islam or Christianity because it isn't based on faith. I started laughing when I read that. A week before reading this book, I flipped through an anthology of the Pali canon (Theravada Buddhist scriptures). The theme of faith is almost as prominent in the Pali canon as it is in the New Testament! Harris doesn't even get his facts straight, so it's hard to take the book seriously. <br /> <br />Finally, I question why Harris is even viewed as an authority on these topics. His bio says that he's a grad student at age 35 and that he spent most of his 20s exploring \\"spiritual disciplines\\" from eastern religions. Has Harris ever held a real job? When you have a psycho boss, you get VERY comfortable with the idea that Hell is real.

B000EGCITG|5.0|First of all, I'm definitely not your \\"typical\\" Pink fan. I'm a Rock/Metal fan who grew up on UFO, Motley Crue, Scorpions and anything else that had big guitars and bigger hair. I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I have always liked Pink's voice and thought she could sing, but I don't like dance music and that's always what I had thought most of her music was- I was wrong. I saw her perform Who Knew on the David Letterman show and immediately bought the CD. <br />This album has it all if you like music that is varied and has vocals that that make you \\"feel\\" the songs. Pink has a voice that can rock with the best of them and then slow it down and feel the emotion of the lyrics.The songs range from \\"Pop/Rockers\\"(Who Knew, U & Ur Hand, Long Way To Happy and Leave Me Alone), \\"Ballads\\"(Nobody Knows and Runaway), \\"Dance Tunes\\"(Stupid Girls) and even \\"Statement Songs\\"(Dear Mr. President). <br />Pink writes with a few different people and I was a little suprised to see Butch Walker had co-written a couple of songs, I knew he had worked with alot of different people, but I didn't know Pink was one of them. If you're not familliar with Butch, check out Marvelous 3 or his solo work. <br />This album is simply a great piece of music and you should definitely give it a listen.
B00006JDS4|4.0|I spit on your grave is a fun film for fans of Wes Craven's \\"Last House On The Left\\" and other \\"Rape/Revenge\\" classics, There are some elements of this film that are genuinely gruesome, and others that are practically laughable, either way, it's not a bad way to spend 100 minutes of your life, not if your like me anyway. Joe Bob Brigg's commentary on this film is a great treat for anyone who has heard about this picture because of it's controversy, because he does a great job of explaining all of that, and also if your just a big movie buff and want to hear interesting facts about the movie, because that track is chock full of info that is a great addition and Joe bob is pretty entertaining anyway, Meir Zarchi also has a commentary track on this DVD witch is interesting because i had heard that he had kept pretty quiet about this picture since making it, but frankly i was ready to fall asleep about 40 seconds into his track so i can't really say i found it that interesting, all in all \\"I spit on your grave\\" is a fun midnight movie for hardcore buffs, and curious horror fans alike.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|I have never played the game so I approached this film with a completely neutral mindset. I had not read any reviews of it, prior to seeing it either. For me this was a film from Cristopher Gans, the director of the remarkable and original 'Brotherhood Of The Wolf.' As such his most recent outing deserved my attention. And in a nutshell, I was not disappointed either.<br /><br />Silent Hill is taken from the game of the same title. The scenario is an abandoned town which sits in mountainous terrain and has been abandoned by its inhabitants because of the massive underground fires which are burning all around, perpetually fed by the subterranean coal seams. The sky is grey due to the smoke from these fires. In an eerie and stunning visual (which is disturbingly like scenes from Auschwitz) ash continuously falls from the sky like snow. The inhabitants of this town are a congregation of religious fanatics, totally in thrall to their maniacal leader (another superb performance from Alice Krige). These denizens have to contend with a darkness that falls intermittently across the town. The advent of this darkness falling is the eerie sound of a huge warning siren (another piece of WW2 imagery) that beckons anyone in the town, to race for the sanctuary of the town's church, the only place that can withstand the darkness. This darkness is home to all sorts of Lovecraftian monstrousities. These move slowly but with terrible purpose, and the fate of anyone caught by them is not a pleasant one...<br /><br />Into this hellish world come Rose and her daughter Sharon, the latter having been tormented by dreams of Silent Hill, a place that she has seemingly never visited. Rose is played by Radha Mitchell (the pilot in Pitch Black) who turns in another strong performance. Accompanying Rose is a female motorcycle cop whose initial suspicions regarding Rose and her daughter are quickly displaced by the desperate struggle for survival that both she and Rose have to undertake in Silent hill, all the while searching for the now missing Sharon. Rose learns that her daughter is the 'good' part of another girl - Alessa who was horribly burnt by Krige's bunch of fanatics for being 'evil'. The 'evil' part of Alessa has remained in te town and has become the demonic entity behind the darkness, all the time looking for revenge on her tormentors - Krige and her fanatical following.<br /><br />This is a film of stunningly surreal imagery and horror images that in my opinion are very Lovecraftian, in fact superbly so. The viewer is left with two possible scenarios for the Silent Hill existence:<br /><br />Firstly, Rose, Sharon, and Officer Bennett died when their vehicles crashed and that Silent Hill is some purgatorial plane between Heaven and Hell which also houses the spirits of Krige and her followers.<br /><br />Secondly that the town is another plane of existence and that Sharon, Rose, and Officer Bennet have all been summoned to by Alessa to be part of her final confontation with Krige and her cohorts.<br /><br />The otherwordly scenarios of both possibilties are underlined by the desperate and increasingly futile attempts of Rose's husband (played by Sean Bean)as he wanders round an empty Silent Hill with another policeman in tow, sensing his wife is near but never able to communicate with her. The film's final sequence only serves to underline this.<br /><br />Silent Hill is a film of imagination and stunning surreal imagery. Whether you are a fan of the games or like me just wish to see a very original horror film, then Cristopher Gans delivers in spades, superbly moving on from 'the Brotherhood Of The Wolf.'<br /><br />Highly recommended.lent hill, all the while searching for the now missing Sharon.

1400034779|5.0|This is Alexander McCall Smith's best work - his story revolves around an independent, intelligent, admirable Botswana lady, Precious Ramotswe. This proud African lady solves life's little (and big) mysteries using nothing more than her brains, senses and the instructions of a mail order detective book. Delightful and moving, the characters that inhabit Precious' eventfully uneventful life not only teach us about ourselves, but also give us an appreciation of a lifestyle more about living and less about scheduling/acquiring/gossiping - while the landscape inspires a feeling of peace and longing for something simple and pure.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Please check it out - along with the rest of the series - all of which are worthy of your time and attention.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is what it is, a splatter-packed, nudity filled, violent vision of perverts vs. vigilantes, and shameless prostitutes vs. the world. The visual techniques are very impressive and make Sin City a film icon unto itself... it's not reality, nor any other movie you've seen, but occupies it's own niche as something black, white, and painted... something artistic.  <br /> <br />The plot follows a few short stories that all revolve around the main characters immediately getting knee deep in the dead. The characters narrate their own adventure with bleak, grim voices, which is a hit and miss technique. Women are portrayed very badly, as hookers and strippers almost exclusively, who rarely wear clothes.  <br /> <br />Overall, I really liked the ridiculous violence, stylized visuals that are actually not gimmicky, and atmosphere of the story telling. I'd warn you though that many women may feel differently because of the sexism of this type of male fantasy flick.
0743298020|5.0|It is a dark and stormy night as I write this. Or, to be more accurate, a dark and stormy morning. The weather reflects the exquisite melancholy that has settled itself upon me at the completion of The Thirteenth Tale. Diane Setterfield's debut novel is one of those all-too-rare stories that gets under your skin, that grabs hold of your imagination with both hands and won't let go. <br /> <br />I have cherised the reading of this book over the last week. All other books were set aside. When I wasn't reading The Thirteenth Tale, I was thinking about it, remembering it. I looked forward to those stolen moments when I might be able to read but a few pages as much as I did those hours that I could devote to the tale. I hung on every word and savored The Thirteenth Tale as one would a well-prepared meal. And now it has ended and, contrary to my normal habits I am not anxious to pick up the next story. I am not yet ready to move on. <br /> <br />To put it plainly, The Thirteenth Tale was bound to fail. It had to overcome the weight of considerable expectations. It seemed that everywhere I turned prior to its release someone or some thing was inducing me to buy this book. Comparisons to Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca only served to heighten those expectations. And as I stood in the bookstore holding this beautiful volume in my hands (raised letter dust jacket with an image to make a book lover swoon, serrated pages that smelled of new paper and fresh ink, gold embossed designs on the spine of the book itself) my expectations were at a fever pitch. <br /> <br />As I read those first pages I was nervous. Diane Setterfield was obviously attempting to speak with the voice of her gothic ancestors a century or more gone. A few of the initial sentences worried me. This style of writing seems always to be balanced on the edge of a precipice...one sentence fragment too many will tip it over that edge. I needn't have been concerned. Within a few pages it was apparent that Setterfield was a skilled performer. And really, if you think about it, she had an ace up her sleeve. Her protagonist, Margaret Lea, is a book lover. Sentences like: <br /> <br />\\"There is something about words. In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner. Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce you skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts. Inside you they work their magic.\\" <br /> <br />and  <br /> <br />\\"I still believe in stories. I still forget myself when I am in the middle of a good book.\\" <br /> <br />could be mantras for those of us who have shared our love of books of late. With the kindred spirit of the bibliophile I was willing and anxious to follow Margaret on her adventure. And what an adventure it was. <br /> <br />As I indicated at the beginning I will not spoil any part of the story for you. Simply put, The Thirteenth Tale is a grand novel in the gothic tradition. If you have read the book jacket you know that the story features a ghost, a grand old house, and family secrets. The novel allows us to witness the act of one person telling their story to another and in those moments Diane Setterfield's writing transports you to the very side of this storyteller, making you feel like the story is being told you and you alone. A delicious air of suspense pervades this story in both its revelation of the nature of evil and in its resolution of the various plot threads that are skillfully woven together by Setterfield.  <br /> <br />The back inside flap of the book jacket promises that Setterfield will, \\"in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life\\". She keeps her promise. <br /> <br />
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Iron Maiden has become too sophisticated a band to review after acouple of spins.  These men are geniuses.  Like a classic novel or painting,  there is so much excellent stuff going on that it needs to SLOWLY sink in and permeate your mind.  Most reviewers nowadays (even professional ones) simply don't take the time for quality work to sink in.  Please let this album play at least ten times over a couple of weeks and you will see that Maiden are incredible.  It's like when kill 'em all or reign in blood FIRST came out---you can't absorb that kinda stuff right away.  This type of Metal takes you to places beyond the 80's classic stuff.  SO GROW INTO IT ---  it is an incredible journey of an album.  The tracks only sound similar at first.  They will become distinct with time.  A true classic is not devoured all at once---that is the sign of boring and average music that is old after a month.  THIS album gets better and better.  I tell you, it's an amazing trip once you let it seep in.  DON'T BE SO QUICK TO JUDGE this masterpiece.  Can't wait to see them in Hartford where they open their tour!!!   Metallize Now and Be Happily Free!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000GFLE1S|4.0|KINKY BOOTS has a lot of positive things going for it- a cast that is committed, a pace that is fluid, the presence of some fun song and dance sequences, and a lot of sight gags and moments of introspection and awakening.  The problem is that, for all the sweet ideas the film explores, the story has been repeatedly done: small town folk facing job loss and identity crises turn things 'round to have a jolly ending (Calendar Girls, Billy Elliot, Waking Ned Devine, The Full Monty, etc).  But this film works on many levels and is definitely worth an evening's entertainment.<br /><br />Charley Price (Joel Edgerton) has been groomed since childhood to take over the Price Shoe Factory in Northampton yet when he finishes schooling he is off to London to lead his own life when suddenly his father dies and the shoe factory is doomed unless he returns.  Finding the production of men's brogues in disarray (he is on the dangerous edge of bankruptcy) he begins letting the long-term employees go until one of the spunkier ones Lauren (Sarah-Jane Potts) reprimands him into thinking about finding new avenues for the factory's future.  A tip to London and to a nightclub with Drag Queens sparks the idea of creating high heeled boots that can support a man's weight: the new market will be drag queens.  One star drag queen is Lola/Simon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is brought to the factory, startles the workers with her style, but comes up with a design for kinky boots that eventually the factory successfully makes and enters into the fashion line at Milan: the factory - and the people who work there - is saved and minds are broadened and changed.<br /><br />The story is at its best when it involves the numerous drag numbers by Chiwetel Ejiofor who is clearly the star of this film.  He is a compassionate person, plays his role with fire and spice and vulnerability and steels every scene he is in.  The remainder of the cast (including the very reliable Linda Bassett - Oscar and Lucinda, The Hours, Calendar Girls, Separate Lies, etc - , Nick Frost, Stephen Marcus, and others) is superb.  So for a storyline idea a bit stale (even though it is based on a true tale), the movie works: it is an ensemble creation.

B00005JP5J|2.0|Just before I sat down to watch the film LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE I was leafing through a copy of Douglas Adam's final anthology of writings called The Salmon of Doubt.  In an article he wrote called \\"Turncoat\\" he mused \\"I wonder if we don't have too much comedy these days...nowadays everybody's a comedian, even the weather girls... We laugh at everything.  Not intelligently anymore, not with sudden shock, astonishment, or revelation, just relentlessly and meaninglessly.\\"  After the movie was over I couldn't get that thought out of my head.  Here is a film that attempts to be dark, attempts to be charming, attempts to be edgy, attempts to be independent, and is yet drops the ball because in the end it has nothing cohesive to say.<br /><br />Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is the cutest little kid in the world.  The kind of kid who just looks at the world with wide-eyed wonder.  She sweet even if the world around her isn't so.  Her Dad (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker and an even worse role model, her mom (Toni Collette) is far to permissive, her brother (Paul Dano) hates his life and has taken a vow of silence, her grandpa (Alan Arkin) snorts heroin, and her Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) has shown up on their doorstep after a botched attempt to take his own life.  This motley family is about to make a 700 mile trip in a beat up VW Van with a busted clutch to get Olive to the National Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest in Redondo Beach. Will they survive each other?  Or will Olive's dream of becoming a beauty queen come crashing down?<br /><br />LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the kind of movie that will leaving you feeling good at the end only because it ends on such a high note.  The last ten minutes of this film are easily the best.  They're what you're going to talking about as you leave the theater.  As for the other 90 minutes well that's up in the air.<br /><br />The film is far to moody.  There is a fine line between dark humor and just plain darkness.  LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE spends too much of it early scenes developing realistic characters.  They laugh, they cry, and then the film betrays this honesty by asking them to fall into farce.  The screenplay goes into auto-pilot and the characters turn into independent film cliches'.<br /><br />The actors do the best they can with the material but alas the film feels so artificial.  You start to see some themes pop out that would make good talking points in an article or interview, but in the context of the film it's all just filler.  Every character gets to wax poetic then they get to do something silly.  Then the film makes some blanket statement about how life is as phony as a beauty contest, there is an act of rebellion, and then everybody hugs.<br /><br />The films biggest problem is that the screenplay is such a rip off of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION.  Except instead of Wally World the Hoovers are on their way to Redondo Beach and there is a Proust scholar in the car.  There is even a scene in which a dead body shows up and they have to put it in their car.  I was waiting for Randy Quaid to show up and ask Greg Kinnear's character for money.  That's what this film needed Uncle Eddie.<br /><br />LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a \\"dark comedy\\" that's far too dark and not really all that funny.  It has it's moments, and on the surface  it is very sweet and charming.  Little Abigail Breslin steals the show, giving Olive a wisdom beyond her age, and a wide-eyed wonder.

We could send back to him these awful DVD's along with the following request:    We want the original, unadultered Star Wars (no \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" nonsense):  - Remastered  - In ANAMORPHIC Widescreen  - In Dolby Digital 6.1 AND DTS 6.1  - With the ORIGINAL ARTWORK  - Comentary by George Lucas AND The Cast  Bonus Disc including:  - From script to screen  - Picture Gallery  - Deleted Scenes (with commentary)  - Original \\"Making Of\\" featuretes  - Original trailers  Third Bonus Disc including:  - The new Star Wars version  Easter Egg:  - The Star Wars Holiday Special    I suppose that all of the people at Lucasfilm including Georgie himself are considered \\"geniuses\\"...then how in the world haven't they understood that THIS is what WE WANT? Is it really too hard to comprehend?
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|This is a pretty cool movie and all, but at some point you just have to pause and say, \\"Huh?\\" To borrow a phrase from the great and wise Ricky Ricardo, this movie has some 'splainin' to do. Heaven knows I love watching a young woman kick butt every which way from Sunday, and there's nothing sexier than the bare midriff look Milla Jovovich has going throughout this film, but -- and maybe I'm old-fashioned -- I sort of expect a movie to explain at least a few of its most unusual facets. For example, our heroine in this film can pull weapons out of thin air, make her hair and clothes change colors on a whim, and has no respect for the concept of gravity. All I know about her is that she was a normal human being who caught an engineered virus that turned her into a hemophage, died and was restored to life for further testing, and then escaped. I can buy into the whole heightened senses thing, but how this allows her to morph and avoid hails of bullets fired directly at her is quite beyond me. While I'm at it, let me also say that the central storyline has more cracks in it than, uh, something full of cracks. The ending is pure deus ex machina squared.<br /><br />The movie starts off great, though. I really liked the comic book montage style of the opening credits, and the film itself wastes no time in throwing Violet (Milla Jovovich) up against hordes of bad guys trying to kill her. The point of her initial, solo raid is to steal a new weapon the humans have designed, a weapon supposedly capable of wiping out Violet and all of her fellow hemophages. Said weapon turns out to be unlike anything you would expect, and Violet's decision to protect it rather than destroy it sets the stage for the remainder of the film. Her hemophage allies want the weapon either brought to them or destroyed, Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund), the weapon's creator and all-around power-hungry tyrant, wants it back, and Violet has to forge her own path through all this mess.<br /><br />Obviously, the filmmakers just wanted to show ninety minutes of Milla Jovovich doing what she does best, and the plot they threw together is really just a means to that end. The basic storyline is easy enough to follow, but far too many of its details go unexplained. As for the special effects and fight scenes, there's some really gnarly stuff on display here, but a lot of the CGI work is just overkill. Additionally, the cameramen are like kids with a new toy as they experiment with every angle known to man.<br /><br />Despite its inherent weaknesses, though, I really enjoyed the first hour or so of this film -- and then the novelty of all the fast and furious action wore off, leaving me to wade through another half hour of a pretty slippery and generally unimpressive story. Even the action goes downhill as the climax approaches, as too many of Violet's fights prove to be laughably easy ' and accompanied by incredibly clich&eacute; dialogue. The bottom line is this: Ultraviolet will definitely get your blood pumping, but it inevitably puts your brain cells on standby.<br />Obviously, the filmmakers just wanted to show ninety minutes of Milla Jovovich doing what she does best, and the plot they threw together is really just a means to that end.

0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin rank in the top tier of presidential biographers, right next to David McCullough, with her newest book Team of Rivals. My eyes are weak & Richard Thomas' narration is just right in the audio version, which I highly recommend. Besides getting a sense of the political side of Liccoln, you get biographies of four great men you might not read about much. I came away realizing that Lincoln was,   despite his \\"aw schucks,\\" railsplitter routine, a brillant man & a master politician. One of the best ever. All four of these men, Stanton, Chase, Steward & Bates underestimated Lincoln. They felt superior to him & even hated him. All four had presidential aspirations & all four were towering figures of their time.  Lincoln was not. He had been a one term congressman over a decade earlier. All this Ms. Kearns-Goodwin lays out for us. To run for president any man (woman) must have self-confidence & yes, a healthy ego. Lincoln had these, of course, but he was able to overcome these emotions & make men, who had humiliated him in the past, important parts of his administration. Must have been of some grim satisfaction on Lincoln's part. You might imagine after hundreds (thousands?) of books on Lincoln there is nothing left to write. Ms. Goodwin made it fresh. The new angle was the great men of the time vs Lincoln. How they evolved from enemies to partners that grew to repect & even love him & to preserve the nation in the time of its greatest peril.
B000HKCRW2|1.0|It's incredible how a band with so much potential and a great debut could follow it up with such a dud. There is close to nothing capitvating or engaging on this record. The songs feel like poor B sides to the original album, and while nobody ever claimed them to be geniuses they WERE catchy, but even their keen pop sensibility is pretty much lacking here. Slightly amusing for one spin, but in the long run utterly fogettable. Not even worth your time to illegally download.

031236198X|4.0|Fables have been used to illustrate problem solving, among many other things, for hundreds of years. Remember Aesop's fables? Several years ago, Kenneth Blanchard successfully re-introduced using fables to teach problem solving techniques with his book, Who Moved My Cheese. John Kotter replicated that method of instruction with this fun little book, OUR ICEBERG IS MELTING. As with the aforementioned work, I believe this one will garner similar acclaim.<br /><br />Kotter's engaging story introduces the 8 principles of problem solving. This can be used in a variety of venues from business, church, child raising, sports, etc. Kotter illustrates how the penguins, faced with a tumultuous dilemma, identified the problem, created urgency, developed a team-building structure, and stepped outside the box. Along the way, the story is entertaining and includes a diverse array of skepticism, cynicism and other challenges that we all face.<br /><br />The book is also very well illustrated and can easily be read in a couple of hours. It is also readable for almost any age level and would probably make a good reading lesson for children as well. They will certainly be entertained, if not captivated by the illustrations and side notes. Well done.
B000G759LW|5.0|This woman can really sing, and it's a pleasure to hear such diversity from her.  The songs are great, the back-ups and instrumentation are outstanding, and it's pure joy to listen to this CD.  I hope this influences other artists to work on original vocal technique and presentation.  This CD is a shining star, and so is Christina Aguilera!
0679422714|5.0|The biography of Mao Tse-Tung is the history of modern China. The authors' extensive research into the life of Mao has produced a gripping story not only of an important historical figure, but also an interesting portrait of a megalomaniac who would stop at nothing to seize complete and total power. On the one hand the story is inspiring because Mao succeeded where many had failed inspite of repeated failures and aggregious mistakes along the way. On the other, this man was pure evil: inhumane to his subjects, un-fatherly to his children, unloving to his many wives and distrustful of anyone and everyone. He modeled a state in his own image with disasterous consequences.<br /><br />Impeccably researched, this book gives dates, details and accounts of the birth and life of the modern communist state that one can find in no other book. Excellent.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I have waited a long time for this moment.  The fact that this actually happened is nothing short of amazing.  Seeing what the extra material is on this only makes me want this version more!!  It's got a docu on the restoration, deleted scenes, an intro by Richard Donner, and what im most looking forward to.........a full length commentary with Donner and Tom Mankiewicz.  This will be amazing.  Truly amazing.  The fact that they even allowed Donner to come back and finish completing his film after he had been fired is astounding!!  This is not the version most of you are familiar with.  That one was directed by Richard Lester.  This one by Donner is considered the true sequel to the original Superman-The Movie, which Donner also directed.  Enjoy it my friends because this is movie history!
0688170528|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could throw it in the trash! There is one story, from the first page to the last. It is depressing and unbelievable. the characters are unreal, The story is weak and when you mercifully get to the end, you still have no answers. You still don't know why this privlidged, spoiled girl, has to commit suicide. You don't expect parents in the middle of crisis, one only child dead, the other a top student and amamzing boy, on trial for his life, to be caught in a flirtaous and ridiculous almost affair. Throwing in a litlle of the lawyer, who cares. I will never buy any of her books again. I hated it!
B000H7JD4A|3.0|Definitely not the best album Maiden has produced. Not as good as Seventh Son, Piece of Mind or Dance of Death. Fine songs in this album, but then it's all a matter of preference. For me I prefer Maiden's heavier songs and this album is certainly a little too less heavy for me. But not a bad album though, if you like more melody than heavy, and there is some beautiful music in here.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I very much enjoy the music to this movie. My favorite track is \\"The Secret Life of Daydreams.\\" This music is peaceful and resting. I did not like the movie except for the gorgeous scenery and a very few moments of good acting. However, knowing the orignial story I can imagine it to the music or even just enjoy it for what it is, great music. I highly recommend this cd. My personal recommendation is that if you have the software to take out the beautiful scenery in the movie, then make your own movie set to the soundtrack backround. This way you can enjoy only what you want of the movie, accompanied by this wonderful music.
B000G73UEU|2.0|Give this a pass and pick up Jennifer Warnes' Famous Blue Raincoat instead.  One listen to Stevie Ray and Robben Ford on \\"First We'll Take Manhattan\\" and Warnes' exquisite rendition of the title song will make you forget this mish mash entirely.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|Many people hear the name of this title and immediately it evokes violent and sadist images. The reputation of this film preceeds it. But in actual fact the shroud of mystery surrounding this shocker is lifted when you listen to the directors commentary. So affected was he by a real life incident that he made this film as a fitting revenge story for women ironically. Meir Zarchi's commentary is quite absorbing and even though he sounds like he's reading a book to five year-olds, seems quite articulate in his Italian(presumably)way. This film is way up there with the other classics of the late 70's, early eighties era when directors DID possess the power to truly shock and disgust and in many ways is representative of the lust we have to see real horror, be it supernatural or crime-related. As modern cinema drags us through the mincer again churning out yet more horror remakes with ridiculous budgets, and fresh-faced teen TV stars, it still can't reproduce the grittiness and reputation of a film like I Spit On Your Grave. Even the masters of horror - Carpenter, Hooper or Craven have lost their touch leading us to believe that these 'old' films were truly part of horror's golden age. So rather than try to re-invent the past, buy this dvd and re-live it!
B000068OCS|5.0|One doesn't look at life or the world in quite the same way after seeing \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\".    From the creeping slowness of shadows across red canyons, to the fitful churning of clouds, to the blur of crowds in fast motion, and the monumental stillness of a single human face emerging from the mass, this film pulls the viewer through an evolutionary journey from balance to disintegrating glory. The meanings, as Reggio says, lie somewhere in the space between the images and the music--but it is for the viewer to find them.     Watching \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" is something of a religious experience. I come away from it with an aching heart--aching from wonder at the world's beauty, at the fragility of humankind, and a sense of tragedy underneath it all.     \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" reveals the epic quality of ordinary life.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Thi is one of maiden's best albums!,it's unbelievable!, drums,guitars, bass and lyrics are in perfect sinchrocity...I love this cd and I don't care what critics say, this cd just takes you to a different planet!!, can't wait to see them in Chicago in October...UP THE IRONS!!..LONG LIVE EDDIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. <br />C.

B00064VR0W|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this, but let me just say I and the others I watched it with were extremely pleased! Rod's voice never changes, and to hear him sing the songs live without trying to change them up too much is a breath of fresh air. He can sing anything and sound great! A definite must for any Rod Stewart fan!
B000AADYUI|5.0|This album changed my life, but my newly purchased remastered copy has a skip in \\"Mau Mau (Amerikon)\\".  It's at the 4 minute mark right when Paul is about to say \\"Yang\\", but the word \\"the\\" hiccups two or three times before continuing.  The rest of the CD sounds perfect.  I did not buy this on Amazon but at Newbury Comics.  I returned my copy and went to a different store to get it only to find the exact same glitch.  It seems that the remastered pressing has a problem, but I'm wondering if anyone else has found this.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I am a relative newcomer to the band Marillion, although I understand that they have been around for nearly thirty-five years or so. Marillion hails from Britain, and could be succintly described as an art- or prog- rock band, which really wouldn't do justice to the soothing, smooth blanket of mood they create. This album is simply one of the best of the best in the progressive rock genre. It manages to be both soothing and uptempo, both experimental and traditional (in the rock idiom), both hip and intelligent, both mature and energetic. I simply can't sing the praises of this album enough. They make me feel like I do when I listen to Pink Floyd, sort of melancholy, yet hopeful. After many years as a band, their experience as artists really seems to culminate on this album (I have since purchased many more Marillion albums, and they are all just superb). Beautiful, melodic reverb-drenched guitar work that just bleeds emotion, phenomenal mellotron and synth work that perfectly frames and complements the rest of the band, and absolutely wonderful vocals from my man Steve Hogarth. Combine all of these elements with the fact that they are clearly working together as an experienced band who really responds to each other, and you have an amazing album. The lyrics are also very compelling, hopeful, and intelligent; the album is a conceptual piece of sorts, based on a series of vignettes interspersed throughout the album (Marbles I, Marbles II, etc.)telling the story of a young person growing up and his journey through life...very inspiring and cool. This is incredible music by an incredible band who deserves much more success than they have gotten stateside. Even better is the two-disc version available on their website, which includes several songs cut from the single-disc version, including the incredible prog epic \\"Ocean Cloud\\", which tells the story of a man alone at sea. Another great thing about Marillion is their seemingly genuine interest in their fans; they seem like a bunch of great people. This one is in my top-ten of the decade. A must-own for anyone who thinks and feels.....stunning!like a bunch of great people. This one is in my top-ten of the decade. A must-own for anyone who thinks and feels.....stunning!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I think I first saw these guys on Letterman.  They were great.<br /><br />This is the best record I've heard in a long time.  I love Cee-Lo Green's voice.  It's almost disco.  It has a sound that takes you back.  Kinda like Motown meets Disco.<br /><br />Awesome!!!
B0001AP158|1.0|Just about every Friday night, we have friends over to listen to various concert DVDs. After having a few mellow weeks, I thought we'd try Bon Jovi. This DVD was a HUGE disappointment to us. The problem is that there is no indication whatsoever (that I could see) telling you that this concert was going to have the band singing all of the songs in ballad style. \\"Bad Medicine\\" sung like a ballad? No thanks. We basically fast forwarded through the entire show, giving each song a few minutes and then realizing we didn't like it. I hope to find another Bon Jovi concert DVD that will make me happy.    To those that are disappointed in people giving this a bad review, it's different strokes for different folks. I don't think this takes anything away from the true talent Bon Jovi has, however, I will maintain that I'm simply not a fan of the band trying to sing their songs differently when so many people are used to what Bon Jovi has been for years. When you hear a song a certain way for so long, it's difficult for some to hear it sung differently.
B000GFLE86|3.0|Miss Peyroux reminds me a lot of Billie Holiday. She has an exceptional and beautiful singing voice. Her rendition of standards in this album is great. She should just record a real jazz album full of the great american songbook. <br />I am a big fan of her but I am still waiting for album of just standards.
B00002ND77|5.0|There are many lessons to learn from this 1992 bio. about slain civil rights activist , Malcom X. I think that one of the most obvious lesson wa that Hollywood wasn't teady for a film of this magnitude. Demonstrated by Denzel Washinton's snub at the Oscars ( Best Actor ) , for his piercing , haunting , and unforgettable portrayal of Malcom X. The film , based on the Alex Haley book , entitled \\" The Autobiography of Malcom X \\" , chronicles the life of Malcom Little ,from a poor negro child, raised in the openly racist and oppressive time of the 1920's and 1960's , turned hoodlum ,turned convict , turned redeemed soul , turned political activist. This film is very poignant, as it tells the story of one of the most influencial , charismatic , and feared revolutionaries of his generation. Spike Lee, does a phenominal job at capturing the essence of this story , with affection , direction , conviction and sensativity. As a matter of fact , this is by far the best feature film , the director has put out. Whereas , Speilberg has his \\" Jaws \\" , Lucas has his \\" Star Wars \\" , and so Spike Lee has his signature piece in \\" Malcom X \\". With riveting supporting performances by such notable actors as Delroy Lindo , Theresa Randle , Angela Bassett , Albert Hall , Al Freenman Jr. , Lonette Mckee ,Kate Vernon, Christopher Plummer , Giancarlo Esposito , and a host of other cameos. Although largely snubbed by the Oscars , \\" Malcom X \\" was nominated for 2 ( Best Actor: Denzel Washington , and Best Costume Designer : Ruth E. Carter ). One good footnote is that Denzel Washington did win Best Actor by the Golden Globes , aka : Oscar's little brother. The cinematography is fabulous and the score is memorable. This is truly a film that all the crew and cast loved passionately and it shows in the final product. \\" Malcom X \\" is a very poignant and important film. It illustrates the necessity to understand one another and the need to somehow cooperate with each other on a human level.Ultimately , this film is not only about the struggle between the races in America , but also about the dynamics of our cultures and the difficulties that we all have , in accepting our differences as people. Hard to believe that a single film can capture these elements. However , it does capture these elements , perfectly. Needless to say , I highly recommend this film., this film is not only about the struggle between the races in America , but also about the dynamics of our cultures and the difficulties that we all have , in accepting our differences as people. Hard to believe that a single film can capture these elements. However , it does capture these elements , perfectly. Needless to say , I highly recommend this film.
B000002GQE|5.0|DAY OF FUTURE PAST is my second favorite Moody's album next to ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM. Mainly, because they constantly play &quot;Night's In White Satin&quot; and &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; on my radio stations that I'm burned out on those tunes. I still like those songs, but just don't want to hear them everyday. But to tell you the truth in terms of production and creativity, this gem is one of the top four or five albums in pop/rock history. Since I'm an avid listener of classical music, it's good hear the blending of pop/rock with the orchestra. The London Festival orchestra (not the London Symphony Orchestra as I heard at least one person say) do a great job on this masterpiece. I don't know if this was nominated for a grammy but if it wasn't it's a travesty. You won't be dissappointed with this first album by the classic lineup (I heard one of your previous reviewers blasting a guy who said that ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM was their 3rd album but I think he was just calling it the 3rd album of the classic lineup). ENJOY THIS TREAT!!!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I simply LOVE this album.  Elton John is a phenomenal artist.  His lyrical flow soothes my soul.  This album is definitely my comfort music when I'm sad, and my fun music when I'm happy.  I pop in my cd while I'm driving down the road and it feels as though I'm taking a stroll down memory lane.  These songs fill my heart with wonderful memories and I find myself putting certain songs on repeat.  I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear some good music. <br /> <br />
B000GBEWHA|1.0|I don't know if it's only my purchase of Grease but it seems that there is a problem with this new edition of Grease.  It may seem to be the manufacturing defect!      I watched the \\"Rydell Sing-Along\\" feature from the \\"Special Feature\\" menu.  All the songs' lyrics on screen seems to create lines and pixels onto the TV screen within a few seconds when they start singing.  I mean, the movie ran smoothly but the Sing-along is my main complaint.    I exchanged a copy of it for the same one and still had the same problem!  Most of the lyrics jumbled around in the screen at the same time as my previous copy of Grease!  I bought it from Best Buy and was wondering if all stores will carry the defective DVD kind.      This is just a heads up to all those out there that own a copy of Grease:  Rockin' Rydell Edition.  The movie for me gets 5 stars, and have no opinion on the old version since I have not seen it myself.  The main complaint is the manufacturing process of the dvd........and perhaps I wish the deleted scenes were in color.
B0002CX4RM|4.0|I wavered between three and four stars for this one.  I have a personal love of this production, as it is one of the very first I ever saw at the Met (in the 97-98 season).  Dalilah was played in those first productions by Denyce Graves, who is a wonderful opera actress, and very beautiful.  Though Borodina's voice easily trumps hers, I found Graves' portrayal to be superior.  This production was created for Borodina, who skipped the first year because she was pregnant.  The performance on this DVD is the opening night of the 98-99 season.   <br /> <br />There are some great moments here--when Dalilah makes her first appearance emerging from the impressionistic fields, dancing in the short but well-choreographed ballet scene--then sings \\"Printemps qui commence.\\"  Both Borodina and Domingo are in good voice--which is good, because the entire staging of the second act relies on their singing.  The blocking is horible, there is no real chemistry between them, Domigo's acting is leaden, and Borodina has two looks--now I'm seductive, now I'm calculating.  BUT THE VOICE--when she sings \\"Mon coeur souffle a ta voix,\\" and when she releases that sublime \\"Ah! reponds a ma tendresse,\\" pretty much all is forgiven.  Fortunately for the last act there is another well choreographed ballet--this time the famous Bacchanale--because the rest of it is static. <br /> <br />The sheer power and tone of Domingo's voice, and Borodina's beautiful tone really make this worth seeing.  The sets, as is so often the case, are really beautiful on stage, and not as effective on screen--but it is an inventive, colorful production.
B000002GQH|5.0|I'm sorry to hear people talk bad about this awesome album as I was reading the previous reviews. This and maybe ABBEY ROAD and LED ZEPPELIN II are at least the best albums that finished off the 60's. This stuff is just incredible to me, and I buy into the album a lot easier than some of your previous reviewers. This does rival the DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, but beats it just slightly as my favorite Moody's album. This never even had to grow on me like some albums did. ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM is for when you're feeling kind of mellow and there's nothing to do like Sunday (kind of like the song &quot;Lazy Day&quot; talks about) and you want to kick back and relax for a while. Every song is amazing, even though I heard people say that John Lodge didn't do a very good job on this album, I think he wrote a couple of great songs and you guys are crazy if you think that about him. All of the songs are a 10 on a scale of 1-10. My favorites are &quot;Never Comes The Day&quot;, &quot;So Deep Within You&quot;, &quot;Lazy Day&quot;, &quot;Lovely To See You&quot;, &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot;, and &quot;Send Me No Wine&quot;. I think every member had a hand in writing at least one song or more. Usually when I hear Moody's fans talking about what their favorite albums are this doesn't make the top four or five list. It's so underrated it's not even funny. I guess it all comes down to personal taste, but believe me this is an awesome and brilliant effort by this supergroup. I'm surprised this didn't win a Grammy but I don't think this had enough big hits, but it sure deserved the Grammy for best album. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT PASSING UP THIS WORK OF ART!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Because I've seen the Firefly series, I really enjoyed this movie. It tied up a lot of things that were never really explored in the series and also brought out some great universal truths. I appreciated the balance between dark and light. A witty line makes all the difference in a story about destroyed races and death. Firefly and Serenity never take themselves to seriously, but still get their messages across. <br /> <br />All that said, not sure I'd be a fan if I hadn't seen the series. Some of the characters could have used some more development, but there just wasn't time to develop such a huge cast in such a short span of time.
B00008AWOD|5.0|As with other reviews i've done, i'll start out saying that Placebo is my favorate band ever.  And that this album came out during the height of my obsession with their music.  At the time, life was in turmoil, so their previous album(Black Market Music) and this one quickly became my personal soundtrack to losing hope.  I still can't listen to this album without getting some sort of intense flashback.<br /><br />The album isn't without its perky points, such as the opening blast of Bulletproof Cupid, or This Picture.  However a great deal of the album drives itself into that dark romantic feel that made bands like the Cure and Depeche great.  In the USA, its always amazing how the band never became larger then they are, as I find them a very easy hook for friends looking for a new group.<br /><br />Although if you plan to buy this album, I would recommend looking for the special edition with the covers disc included.  Its almost a full album in itself and very much worth the extra price.
0307346609|5.0|Having read the Zombie Survival Guide, I dropped this into my Amazon shopping cart before it even hit the shelves. I was pleased as punch when it arrived the other day, and I couldn't put it down.   <br /> <br />I've read a lot (a *lot*) of zombie fiction.  Frankly, most of it has a good story to tell, but much of the story gets lost in bad grammar and horrible (sometimes nonexistent) editing.  Alas, most Z-fic never rises (ha-ha) above the level of fan-fic. <br /> <br />Then along comes Max-- uh, Mister Brooks if you please.  Here is a writer worthy of being called \\"Author.\\"  Good enough to be published by a big house, and in hard cover, nonetheless! <br /> <br />As the title of the book says, it is an \\"oral history\\" of the zombie war, told to the chronicleer some number of years after the war has been \\"won\\" (at a horrible cost of lives).  It chronicles the years from the first outbreaks, through the heart of the war and into the cleanup years, all told from different points of view.   <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Brooks does an excellent job keeping consistency in his story, and an even better job hopping from character to character in each tale.  Each character has a distinct voice and personality.   <br /> <br />Mister Brooks doesn't go over the top with respect to gore in this novel, so if you're looking for a munchfest like \\"Day by Day Armageddon\\" (another fine book, though not quite on literary par with this one), or \\"The Rising\\" this isn't the book for you.  If you're looking for an intelligent read within the zombie genre, however . . . this is undoubtedly the book you should buy.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Been a fan of Steely Dan for years- since the early 70s.<br />This CD is really of very high quality- and as you listen to more of it you really respect Fagen and the music even more.<br /><br />The title cut is soft and drifting- with a nice harmony, that is cohesive and softly driving. The H gang is simply wonderful- one of the best songs Fagen has done.  The Great Pagoda of Funn is a shimmering song-  with Fagen saying in a lilting way- 'there's a strange new music in the street'... the song has  a wonderful trumpet used as a bridge in the middle- totally infectious- if not melancholy and dark at times. The night belongs to Mona is a another great song, with again an infectious harmony and wonderful vocals- but the subject matter is disturbing and again depressing, about Mona dancing 40 floors above the street...afraid to go out since the 'fire' presumably 9/11.... Mary Shut the Garden Door is another deep look into 'Fear' being used by the powers may be to  control and maintain power in the post 9/11 world.<br /><br />Fagen has created a most disturbing look at post 9/11  America- and the visions he sees are unsettling and dark. The music is superb- the story behind them is another matter.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|My friend had told me about a movie, a movie which was so disturbing and graphic that he had almost puked........ and this was that movie. I had rented it a few weeks later. I heard people talking about it being a Quentin Tarantino film, but when I had looked on the box I noticed that it was just presented by him and that it was directed by Eli Roth, knowing his previous work Cabin Fever I knew that this DVD was going to be nothing special....... and thus I was correct. This movie is basically like one of those SAW ripoff movies that promise you blood and gore, but give you a \\"gruesome noise\\" or a moment where they almost show him clipping off the toe of the girl when the camera quickly cuts to the next scene........ boring.
0230014208|5.0|John Kotter has given change agents like me a great manual to introduce the concepts of change to a board audience.   As a professed change agent who has worked in the academic and public sector for over 40 years, I have found this little book and its story to be an extremely powerful teaching tool.  The penguin and iceberg metaphors work and resonates with even the most sophisticated audiences. I have used this book in conjunctions with workshops on change in the area of patient safety to health care professionals and it is a powerful story.  Having grown up professionally with Everett Rogers and diffusion of innovation and other planned change models, I have found this small book a very practical tool to convey the complex issues around change.  <br /> <br />Our Iceberg is Melting is a must read for change agents or anyone hoping to bring about change in their organization.  <br /> <br />Long live the Penguins <br /> <br />James B. Battles, Ph.D. <br />A professed change agent and proud of it
B00003CY0V|5.0|Don Cheadle, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, and John Travolta star in this movie.  Nice.  Very nice.  And what about the plot?  It's there, and it's tight.  This movie has an up front in your face style that doesn't let up for the entire length of the movie.  You find yourself rooting for the bad guy because he's just so damn cool, but also rooting for Jackman's character because you want to see the good guy win.  Riveting all the way to the end.  Highly recommended.
B000F0V0LI|2.0|This is a review of the \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition,\\" NOT a review of the film itself. If you're considering the purchase of a two-disc special edition, you probably already know that the film is great; you just want to know if this slick package is worth the pricetag.<br /><br />In short, it's not. And let me be absolutely clear about one thing: I have known and loved this film for years. A few sequences look properly spectacular, but after watching this DVD on two separate (and high-quality) televisions, I'm amazed that all of the low-light scenes have been rendered almost completely dark. Like, too dark to tell what's even *happening*. For instance, the scene where Brad (Harry Carey, Jr.) runs off to his death, the scene where Marty's (Jeffrey Hunter's) \\"bride\\" is serving coffee along the river, and even the pre-dawn scenes leading up to the final storming of the Comanche camp, are utterly lost in the dark. By contrast, the bare-bones 1997 DVD release features noticeably richer colors in the daytime scenes and total clarity in the low-light scenes I've just mentioned. Don't waste your money on this special edition; you'll be much happier if you just shell out the $10.99 for the 1997 release.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|This movie is very violent and explicit.  That said, it is also a fabulous presentation of the brutal side of Roman times.  Right from the start there is violence.  This movie is definitely not for children.  If you can stomach the gore, give it a chance.  It is a great story starring Russell Crowe, the premier hero, and Joaquin Phoenix, the main villain.  When you see what happens to our protagonist's family, what he loves most, you will be intensely wishing for justice.  And justice is served, however bittersweet it may be.  This is the best movie involving the Roman Empire that I have ever seen.
B000301YY8|3.0|I don't have anything to say about technique, melody, etc.  I'm just irritated that I got an explicit lyric cd (in a store) without realizing it.  I had no idea since I bought this after getting hooked on Beautiful on the radio and seeing the video in the store - love the way he just stares into the camera!  I am not a prude, don't listen to Christian music, etc., just prefer the radio version without the f word.  I love to sing along, but can't now.  Can't listen in the car with the kids, you get the drill.  I don't really want to pay for a second, clean version - in fact I haven't even listened to it enough to know if there are other words...
B00000JLWW|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and Billy Zane star in this whopper of a movie.  You get to see the personalities of each of them, Leo as the adventure seeking good guy, Billy as the pompous arrogant bad guy, and Kate as the uncertain but later passionate and fun loving lady.  This film has realistic action sequences, an impactful storyline, and is heavy on the romance.  The movie is rather long, but it is very involving and time will fly by.  This is the top grossing film of all time, and has won 11 Oscars including Best Picture.  A wonderful film.
0060825219|5.0|When the stars align in such a way and time is right only then can the right person appreciate the right book. If you do not enjoy this book then perhaps it wasn't your time to read it or simply you didn't understand the true value of it.  <br /> <br />For me the timing was perfect and I could relate perfectly to this book. The book transformed itself and reveiled a more complex plot than one of a man obsessed for his wife. This book will take you on a journey within what love really means (or could mean). Before you look beyond you may search within. <br /> <br />Relating to the author is easy because he speaks in a candid way, so simple and honest. The main character in the book explains things in his life just the way they really exist in all of our lives. He expreses every detail, thought and meaning as he sees it.  <br /> <br />We will all experience a Zahir in our life at one time that is for sure. Reading about it enlightens us and makes us become more in touch with our soul and just a small step closer to understanding meaning of life.
