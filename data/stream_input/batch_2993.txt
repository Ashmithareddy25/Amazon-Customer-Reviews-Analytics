B00EBDXSOW|5.0|Hard to say which album is better -- Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning -- but whichever one it is is probably the best thrash album of all time. Flawless.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|LOVE this band! Wish the other members got as much attention  as Lucy does but their music is still great. Hope to hear more from them.
B00EBDXTJG|5.0|Arguably the best thrash album of all time. Pretty flawless. Only other Metallica album that challenges it is Ride the Lightning.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|Love this group. Love this CD. So I bought the CD instead of just having the computer files. Because I'm a bit strange like that. We need more Canadian singers like this instead of Justin Beiber. :/
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My grandson loves to play this and I must admit I tried it a couple of times.  It's fun to play
0812983459|5.0|I jumped in and didn't come up for air until it was over.  And what a wonderful way to portray fallen humanity in need of grace.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|I downloaded this game for my five year old grandson and of course he thinks it's wonderful.  I have only played it one time
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is the first book that allows the reader to develop an understanding of what causes us to get fat and why some people don't get fat. It finally dispels the strong belief that people get fat because they are lazy or eat too much. It is not just a diet book but it gives the reader the knowledge they need in order to diagnose what it is that causes them to become and stay fat. It also gives insight into what approach will work best for them. Everyone should read this book and understand it completely before they decide on a diet that they can live with and will help them slim down.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was almost scared to read this book for fear I would be so disappointed, but I took a shot! So glAd I did. This book was great. I couldn't put it down.... I love the twist and turns Mr. King took in telling us about a grown Danny'
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I had a pair of Sony MDR series for about 15 years.  To my discredit, i got annoyed an something and a broke off part of the headpiece, rendering them useless.  I looked at every kind of replacement to save money--but finally landed on these.  I AM NOT SORRY--- yes my budget is tight--but headphone affect your hearing.  The other brands felt like the audio was being blasted against my ear drum--it was aweful.  Sony MDR 7506 sounds like a surround-sound theater.  You can hear not only dialogue, but background influences on movies to make the experience more life-like.  the volume can be kept low because the audio-clarity is so high.  It is also in stereo and the ear pieces are marked for right and left ears...when i first got them, the movie i was watching had a phone ringing in the background--and i kept taking off the head phones to answer it....so how realistic is THAT??!!  i have adapted.  Now i do not answer my phone at all!!!  (jus'kiddn')  a STEAL for $77 on Amazon.com
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I grew up in my formulative years listening to Supertramp - and this was such a wonderful trip down memory lane :)
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Gregory Porter is an excellence singer. Love all his cd's, especially this one.Look forward to more music to come from the great performer..
0312330855|5.0|I LOVE this book that's why I ordered another OLD soft cover; the older versions have a much better cover. I received a LARGE hard cover this time so I put it in my apartments's library so the other tenants could enjoy it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A fitting continuation to The Shining. This book is definitely a &#34;must read&#34; for King fans. We finally get to see Danny grow up.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|I got this for my parents point and shoot Canon camera and it is a good size because I can put the camera in there, and I leave the foam slip the camera came in as well in the case and use it as a divider with the battery charger. Then in the front zipper, they have room for an extra battery and memory card. So the case keeps everything together for them and that is so important as they usually lose things otherwise.
B005HBP75K|5.0|This is the best season yet, in my opinion (but I haven't seen the first one). Everything's good and I laughed quite a bit. It's exciting. I highly recommend if you like dramatic intrigue.
B00000DR52|5.0|Got this for my aunt and uncle who loved this movie and the soundtrack. They say they listen to it all the time on long car trips and they were ecstatic to know this was available for purchase still.
B00CHMBQRA|3.0|Though nothing special, ERASED is a watchable thriller about secret and highly corrupt deals with other nations and a rogue agent who suddenly wakes up to find his occupation and entire reason-for-being \\"erased.\\" It moves fast, sometimes too fast--the pacing could use some work--and too much of the conflict is bluntly explained away in the script. ERASED also relies too much on shoot-'em-ups and punch-'em-outs, and the super-tough former agent who's done some terrible things but is a good guy at heart, blahly and routinely played by Eckhart, manages to beat some pretty unbelievable odds. More in the way of subtleties and layers of intrigue would have made this a much better film.<br /><br />ERASED makes for easy and enjoyable entertainment if you're not in the mood to think too hard. As others have noted, the cinematography is quite good, and the film makes colorful use of its Belgian settings. Some of the supporting cast play their roles pretty convincingly; moreover, the acting/characterization of daughter Amy, played by Liana Liberato, gets better as it goes.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Seeing this movie in IMAX 3D, literally improved the overall quality of my life, I never wanted it to end, I'm still trying to come to terms with the fact that all good things eventually do,my therapist says as long as the voices don't come back I should be OK at some point....LOL
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am sure that there is nothing that Google can't find for me. i don't know what on earth we did before we had Google to turn to. (Ungrammatical but you know what I mean).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter really loves this program.  This program allows her to work her kindle  like a pro.  I am really impressed with her progress.
B001AG52AG|5.0|The story line flowed well. The Characters were well portrayed and believable. The settings, costumes and lighting were perfectly balanced.
B000HIVIOW|3.0|Thought it was a blu ray since it was over $30 bucks- wouldnt have paid that much for a dvd when there was cheaper options. Other than that it packaged- good condition- arrived fast. Just not happy about price
1582701709|5.0|It was a great read. Lots of use full tidbits. Even eight years after the fact many people still discuss it.<br />Now to write out that blank check for a million dollars...
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved every minute of this trilogy.  The love that Grey and Ana share is so intense. Can't wait for the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|These aren't your typical teenagers.  They are teenagers that have had to deal with things that no one should ever have to deal with.  I almost put this down after realizing I was reading about kids with cancer.  It has touched me too close as of late.  I plowed through and thoroughly enjoyed the way this was written.  I enjoyed that these kids weren't typical.  That they pushed limits a bit at being believable, but really....they have a terminal illness, wouldn't they grow up quickly?  a MUST read!
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good book. Very similar to 50 Shades of Grey. But different in its own way.<br />Can't wait to read the second book.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I have had the pulse for about a week.  I've tracked my steps and my sleep with the device since I got it. I found the set-up to be easy and the healthmate app to be great.  It is quite informative of my sleep patterns and seems to map pretty well between what I considered a restful night and the amount of \\"Deep sleep\\" the device registered.  I don't think the app is particularly accurate at measuring distances, but I have found it to be spot on in counting steps.<br />I have found the pulse counting feature to be inaccurate enough to not both using it.<br /><br />The form factor is great and I can put it in my slacks or pants pocket and not notice it all day.<br /><br />I bought the WS-50 scale to collect my weight data and by using the healthmate app, the pulse and the scale, I am getting a really good idea of my progress towards my goals.  I recommend both the pulse and the scale.<br /><br />Follow up:<br /> I used the pulse 24 hours a day for about 6 weeks, but then the belt clip failed and I lost the device.  Withings customer service worked with me to make the situation right and a new pulse is headed my way shortly.  During the 6 weeks that I had it, it became the one gadget I had with me everywhere.  It provided me motivation to get up during the work day and to move around when I got home just to make sure I got my steps in.  I did have some complaints about how it measured distances when I ran and some of the sleep data, but I hear they have updated the firmware on the device to fix those issues.  I anxiously look forward to getting my replacement pulse device.  I am going to be more careful about where I wear it though because I've really missed collecting data and monitoring my progress.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last book was the best. Some sex is good. But every page? Ugh. It was good to know that Christian turns out to be a good guy.
B008MVPCL6|5.0|Great fit!! Always heard crocs were comfortable and was not disappointed with the shoes ! Looking forward to buying others soon .
0399159347|3.0|This was okay. I normally love most books I read, but with the secret being exposed midway through the book, I didn't see the need to finish the book. I did anyway, and the ending was all right. This is a minor thing, but one thing I didn't get was that in all of the recollections, Janie was in school on Good Friday, yet Cecilia's states that her kids are always home on Good Friday because it's a national holiday. This sort of discrepancy drives me nuts.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Perhaps one of the best books I have ever read. Truly inspiring! From the dark periods to becoming a true hero, Eric Blehm chronicles the life of Adam Brown.
B0039NK0LE|5.0|This was always a gift and she was happy. Good with the purchase and would buy from again if needed.
1451695195|3.0|This is a good story, and makes a good case for life after death. However, there are several parts in this book where the author way overexplains things. It is almost monotonous when he does this.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|Part of a funny series. I like it so I am very happy with this purchase and will probably gift it.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Easy sale, quick turnaround. Would love to do business again and again. I love this movie collection! Thank you so much.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. This is one of our favorite movies and I would tell anyone and everyone to get it. Such a classic!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This Silver Lining Playbook is one of my favorate movies, especially the ending. The whole premus of the movie is getting the two main actors togather and working out the problems togather.<br />Thanks for all the good movies I've received so far.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't think that Piper was self-centered, or harped too much on her &#34;credentials&#34; I think she was honest and open about her experience. Her character is easy to like.  However, the book was BORING!! It wasn't easy to follow, and was all over the place. Save your money, this book isn't worth your time even if it was free.
B00ALCBTWU|4.0|This movie is stuck in a difficult place, not a big-budget blockbuster, but not a low level sci-fi flick.  So where does it stand?  Well while not being historically very accurate, the acting is compelling with several surprisingly strong performances and the filmography is better than most strait to DVD releases, especially regarding war movies.  This movie is also filled with numerous fire-fights and the special effects aren't half bad either, some of the geographical shots alone are beautiful.  Because the movie was made as a tribute to the game, war movie buffs shouldn't be holding this movie to the same standard of something like 'We Were Soldiers,' or 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Nor should they be expecting garbage like Nazi Zombies, but I have to remind the Historian that this movie was not made to be historically accurate, so don't attempt to compare everything to reality especially with it's limited budget.  If you want a decent action flick that won't having you turning the channel, packed with shoot-outs, great locations, and compelling actors, then you will probably like this movie.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I have enjoyed this app so far. It is a good hidden object game if you like that type if thing.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|I already knew that I wouldn't like this CD, and I was right. I will NEVER buy this record. Outside of rock music (my favorite genre), this is the worst album of 2013. It took that spot even before this album came out. Her past albums and the Hannah Montana sountracks were bad, but they weren't as bad as this. She decides to become an immature twerk-star instead of a strong woman and invites rappers and... ta-da, here you go... a record full of playskool toy songs. I don't have anything else to say since anyone would know I don't like this record.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show! I would recommend this show to anybody I know. Great characters and witty writing. Stop what you are doing and add to your queue.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Power ups are a bit unclear as of to what they do but oh well. It's an awesome game :)
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|My eleven year old thinks it's great.  It's good for when we are waiting somewhere and he needs to be able to quit playing in an instant, the games are short.  The theme is of course amusing  to my pre teen.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|For me, it was an okay movie, but I had a hard time getting into it. No doubt it's due to me being &#34;old time&#34; Trek fan. I enjoyed the original movies much better however, the younger folks will enjoy it.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|The Blu-ray is excellent quality, the dvd is convenient for playing on a game system or car, and the digital copy is simple to install in multiple file types and qualities (though what I did notice is that I couldn't put the digital copy on my 3rd gen iPod, but it did work on a 3rd gen iPad)<br /><br />The movie itself is awesome, defiantly a must have for My Little Pony fans, especially in high def. The special features are ok, but the commentaries take the show, but those all together are about 20-30 min.<br /><br />Another additional note, it is region locked, and only works on region A players.
1612130283|5.0|I was absolutely blown away by this book. Exceeded my expectations completely! Great read. I just couldn't put it down, I read it in one day.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|I used the information contained in this book to heal my eczema, my ankles used to be two bleeding, raw pieces of meat, gapping sores that would not go away, even with expensive jars of prescription meds. Then I started applying the techniques described in this book to heal my ankles, and in a week they are almost healed.  Unfortunately,  there are times that I lose my focus, and during those times I notice my ankles start to itch again....sometime is scratch them.  But still, I am getting better.  I realized by reading this that it is not my ankles I need to treat, it is my manner of thought.  Anyway, maybe its all bullcrap, but it worked for me somehow...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is a good easy read. The movie followed close to the book. I'm ready to read the second in the series.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I want more please tell me where to get the rest of the book.  It's awesome I want to read it.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I know it's a story of redemption and growth but, I've &#34;gone to the woods&#34; all my life and I could hardly stand to read the first half of this book. I nearly discarded it because she was such a fool when it came to being on the trail and life in the &#34;wild&#34;. She could have made more mistakes but not many more. When she got into trouble she found a way to deal with it which was admirable. But, she didn't need all the trouble and pain to have an experience that would have nurtured growth and self confidence. She probably knows that now. If everyone who faced loss and needed to find themselves did it this way there would be many more casualties, I hope others see it as a cautionary tale.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|An intriguing look into secrets, what might have been vs. what IS?  Is anything &#34;meant to be&#34;?  Brought me to tears a couple of times and kept me on emotional edge. I loved this book!
B006M4F67A|4.0|As Mahjong games go this is a fun game. The unusual shapes are fun to play, the tiles are easy to see which makes the game easy on the eyes. I would recommend this game to other Mahjong players.
B00BXI26XC|5.0|You don't get bored,you just watch the flights and see the different flight paths,especially if you our off on your hols yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Wasn't a huge fan of the movie, but the music soundtrack is amazing. Great music and I listen to it on my way to work and it helps pass the time. Fun songs to listen to....
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Forever and always will be a top classic in my book! Mystery, suspense....The Goonies! A classic! A must see, definately!
0783225881|5.0|A classic movie and was filmed outside my hometown in Iowa...the field is still there and you can go visit it anytime. Such a good movie with great actors, all who have gone on to do great things. A must see for anyone in America..
B00A8ECU24|5.0|well its fun for adults and children. and if your a brony you would love this game!!! i LOVE this game. it has a lot of different character's like  ( rainbow dash) ( twilight sparkle) (Apple bloom) (pinkiepie) (Apple_ _jack) and (princess celestia)  and so much more! and if your a BIG fan get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|I really like this band and this album.  Nice track list, with a few surprises, nice amount of talent in the band, and always a pleasure to see an emerging female band that is good enough to not need to &#34;prove&#34; anything.<br /><br />Watching the videos available from their Youtube channel will give you a good idea of what they're like - if you like those songs, you'll probably like the whole album.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Have always enjoy a sweet love story. And also like Ed Asner. Keep up the quality films!
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|Two words sum up Joss Whedon's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING: redundant and lightweight. I am surprised Mr. Whedon has made a movid I'm so ambivilent about, usually I love his work- and MAAN is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays.<br />  It seemed that, with a couple exceptions, the cast didn't know what they were saying, and there was no urgency to what they were all about. They mainly stood around and looked pretty while talking funny. I was reminded of THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, where most of the direction had to have been, &#34;Lean against the counter and say your lines.&#34;<br />  I say the movie is redundant because we already have Ken Branagh's timeless version, which has more teeth, better performances and a clearer narrative.<br />  Kudos to Mr. Whedon for trying but...
B008Y212PI|5.0|I wasn't sure at first but after playing a couple of times, I was hooked! I really enjoyed it and would love to continue playing so I wish it was a lot longer. Overall, it's a really great, relaxing and different kind of puzzle game.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved that this is in the males perspective. I have always wanted a view from the other side. Very  funny with a down to earth feel to it. Awesome.
080701429X|5.0|It is am amazing book! I like it very much, which urges me to think the meaning of life, the freedom of man, and how to transcend himself to be a better person!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Channing Tatum dancing with very little on-what is not to like???  The movie is funny and there is a plot to it.  I love the music and you can't beat Matthew McConaughey's abs.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I grew up with these movies, seeing many of then in the theater.  Very happy to have them all in one collection and in such a quality format.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and recommend it to those who are looking for a great story and a complex I'm plot. Although the book was well written, there was a couple shaky chapters and an actual grammatically incorrect sentence, nobody is perfect, not even Suzanne Collins.  I am a fifth grader who really likes to read and enjoyed this book on a vacation. I hope you feel the same way about the book as I do and I would like to thank you for reading my review.<br /><br />P.S. READ \\"Mockingjay\\"
B00CHVIPP2|4.0|Bought this for the kids, but it's actually a very fun movie.  And the kids love the little Belt stuffed toy.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The combination of Afghan war history and our modern world ( thru the experiences of the Afghani ex-pats) is unique and compelling. As always, he creates characters that make your heart ache for them.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is still a really good love story with really hot reading on to book 3 nothing like reading while my daughter recovers from tonsils surgery
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie kept us captivated from beginning to end. Finally, a good and enjoyable sci-fi, which shows it can still be done!
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|All of the actors were artful and performed well.  However, the storyline was awful.  I guess you could say that the movie could have been named just &#34;Stupid&#34; and that would suffice to describe it.  What an awful attempt to be humourous and what an awful attempt to provide any redeeming entertainment quality.  Surprising that the Actors took this project on given its poorly scripted story.  Nothing about this movie will make you feel good.  If you give it any thought whatsoever you'll find it to be a sad portrayal of &#34;love&#34; and nothing really good.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|Well I have just watched episode 1,so hard to say . I do find it weird that there is still a fee,for that season. Did see it free on other website.
0575116722|4.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. My fault. Not the authors. The writing is beautiful. Like poetry. I'm really bad at poetry so it took me about 100 pages to get into the grove. Once I did...all I can say is STRAP YOURSELF IN FOR SOME FUN!!!! Locke is such a great character, as are all the Gentlemen's Bastards. And Gentlemen's Bastards right there should give you a clue: this is not a book for the \\"I hate rude language and cussing\\" crowd.  Mr. Lynch gives us some great backstory scattered throughout the book so we really get to know how these guys think. Lots of twists. Lots of surprises. More than once I screamed WHAT!! and even more times I laughed so hard my cat (who always sits on my lap while I read) turned and hissed at me. It's a long book. But don't get discouraged. It starts out slow put picks up steam until it's a freight train out of control and you live at next tight bend. Yikes. It's what book reading is suppose to be. Full of characters and details that movies never have the time to explore and many authors just plain ignore. ENJOY.
B00ET9T2WK|4.0|It has more than to units to choose from, lots of things to build, graphics are great, you get to battle friends and other people, make your own &quot;Guild&quot;, and the game itself revolves around strategy. Definitely worth your time.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|The story was very good, with many twists and turns. The only down side was that there were over 100 chapters!
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Always enjoy this movie. Remembering how it was takes your mind off today's life to relax for awhile. Whop bam boom!
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|Too many characters involved you loose track after a while..........The story line was good, and the way he rights very in depth
0061950726|4.0|Thank you for educating me about orphan trains which operated in early 20th-century America; until I read this, I did not realize such  events had occurred.  What a frightening circumstance for children thrown on the world through circumstances not of their making, shipped to another area and told to survive the best they could.  Can you imagine as an orphan standing still while adults inspect you and then do not choose you to live in their homes?  Oh, my, the courage they displayed!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a well-constructed story with well-drawn characters as usual with Stephen King.  It is entertaining and kept my interest all the way through, but the best part is the ending.  Many times I have been hugely disappointed in Mr King's endings and
B00117W1HQ|4.0|Everyone was all &#34;Supernatural this and that&#34; so I figured, what the hey. It's not bad so far (season 1) Sometimes I feel like it's moving too fast and hope the writers can keep things interesting. I guess I'll find out.<br />No spoilers here, but is it just me, or is EVERY female (including the 50yr old mothers/wives etc..) a size 4 or 6?<br />The Supernatural part must be the alternate universe of supermodels everywhere. Then again, with a name like &#34;Supernatural&#34; you're not exactly looking for realism are you?<br />If you can get past that, i think it would be enjoyable
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Yea so Ralph is a bit annoying but the music should hold you and keep you.Watch this movie and if you don't like the Blues in the end then you have a hole in your vsole.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|What an excellent and intriguing read. The storyline keeps you hooked from the beginning and when I was at the last page I just could not believe that I had gone through the first book already. Luckily the second version is also available as a kindle book!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|mesmerizing.  I find in her place...feeling and seeing what she sees.  The writer is insightful...I am finding myself better able to describe what is going on around me more creatively!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|WOW. I've followed Alter Bridge since the beginning, and they are yet to disappoint! Everything about this album is satisfying towards everything I am looking for in a solid Hard Rock / Alternative / Metal album. Mark Tremonti's range of melodic, aggressive, vicious and anthemic riffs come off as explosive as ever! Scott Phillips owns, as usual, giving one fantastic drum track after another. Myles Kennedy continues to deliver insane vocals, and dish out the guitar like a beast. And last, but no way in hell least, Brian Marshall is one with his bass, making you grit your teeth and wince your eyes with every strum!<br /><br />Overall, the album delivers on all fronts! From sick riffs, to melodic anthems, they deliver a wide spectrum of awesome songs. And the track \\"Fortress\\"? I never thought something would top Blackbird. Insanely composed, melodic, haunting composition, with a fantastic interlude that explodes, to symbolize the downfall of The Fortress. I love how the song's real meaning was masked by a perfect balance of symbolism and metaphors. \\"Cry me A River\\", \\"Bleed it Dry\\" and \\"The Uninvited\\" get vicious, while songs like \\"Calm The Fire\\" and \\"All Ends Well\\" deliver heart and motivation. One of my personal favorites is \\"Waters Rising\\", again due to the symbolism, the fantastic composing, and Mark taking a bigger slice of the vocals for a song!<br /><br />A bit about myself: I like Hard Rock / Metal. I am heavily into good song structure, good lyrical content, and wide musical & subject ranges per album. THIS ALBUM DELIVERS ALL THAT, AND MORE. END OF STORY!<br /><br />On the outside looking in...<br />Everything seems fine...<br />But The Fortress caving in comes down...<br />On me...<br />Tonight...
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like it. Successfully cleaned 6+ GB. And it is free! Way to go. Keep up good work!  Thank you.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|A Peter Sellers tour de force, with a plethora of brilliant comedic performances from the likes of Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens, and a personal favorite George C. Scott, just to name a few. For those too young to remember the &#34;Cold War&#34; this is a must see as it captures much of the feeling of the era. Before Duck Dynasty, we had Duck and Cover. In other words, it was a real blast baby.  ...
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|I've been long time fans of Panic! since their album \\"Fever\\" came out. With most of their albums, I've fallen in love with songs immediately while others took a while to grow on me. I assume \\"This is Gospel\\" and \\"Miss Jackson\\" became the most popular, because they were released a while before the album, giving you a feel of what was coming. I was able to digest those two songs for about two weeks, but I loved them the first time I saw the videos.<br /><br />Pros:Brendon is looking and sounding as fine as ever<br />-A fresh, different sound than previous albums<br />-Music videos are PHENOMENAL!<br />-This is Gospel<br />-Miss Jackson<br />-Girls Girls Boys<br />-Vegas Lights<br />-Upbeat mood<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Album is too short (I sympathize because of Spencer's absence and other issues)<br />-I WANT THE TWO EXTRA SONGS AT TARGET!<br />-Lyrics aren't as meaningful and complex as before<br />-Some of the songs had more potential<br /><br />Listen before you buy, but I'm glad I bought this!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|The Rosie Project is a comical view of life from a man who doesn't quite fit into the world around him. Don Tillman's life is organised and soon disrupted by his obsession with 'The Wife Project'. As the book unfolds we are able to observe the way his emotions overrule his logical thinking, even without his own knowledge.<br /><br />It is a very enjoyable read that will keep you turning its pages.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Able to store my SD and micro SD cards very nicely. Fast and friendly service. Thanks.<br />Recommended highly, for anyone who has a storage issue!
006054094X|2.0|This book is fun to read for a couple hundred pages.  Then it becomes overwhelmingly exasperating.  The central thesis runs out of evidence somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
B00FEN000S|1.0|There was obviously more money invested in the packaging and advertising the bad acting.  What's with the japanese submission??  if this movie is meant for US audiences it failed miserably...  I want my money back!!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I have not been able to put it down.  I am not sure if it is all the references to the decade of my childhood or if it is just a great book, but I am glad I made the purchase
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Watching this movie is fun and it always puts me in a happy mood.  It is a well made, well cast movie!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very entertaining and pleasantly written. A little melodramatic at times, but also joyful and romantic. Interesting to read about relationships between white indentured servants and black slaves.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini is a masterful story teller.  In &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34;, he gradually pulls the reader into the emotionally journeys of the multiple characters - wounded souls yearning for some healing - that span three generations.  He does so with such subtlety and understatement that we are drawn into their lives, their pain, shame, fear, and their small triumphs without ever feeling pushed to judge them or anticipate their outcome.  We become ego, id, and emotional companion to these characters.  Hosseini weaves and layers a wonderful texture seamlessly transporting us from 1950s Afghanistan to 1970s France to current day suburban California while darting back and forth along the story's timeline.  This is rich and rewarding storytelling !
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love the visuals and cute prizes and I like how the coins are replenished every 30 seconds and how you keep earning coins even when you're not playing
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My son loves this game but once it did an automatic upgrade the game wouldn't load. Its also frustrating when you try to purchase more coins or bandannas and it says theres no packs available.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This music not only mutates with the times, it sets the times by reshaping the world of music and it can only make one's head explode in awe. For one thing, the teamwork between Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones reaches its peak of perfection on this record. Quincy's laser-sharp production marks that pivotal point in which he taps into a new sound that really does separate the eighties from the seventies. His tautly-produced horns are hypnotic. Of course they wouldn't mean a damn thing if it weren't for the first-rate cuts and for Michael's singing chops. \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" comes from the impulse of dance clubs and, not only is it a superb opener, it's an instant party shaker. With the bridge-building \\"Beat It\\" and its guitar solo in the dexterous hands of Eddie Van Halen, there's just no better synthesis of r&b and rock. Underpinned by a monstrous bass groove, Michael's \\"Billie Jean\\" is an illumination on the dangers of fame. Then you'll find that panorama of sound that's the \\"Thriller\\". This time-stopping classic will appeal to anybody's sense of the morbid. That cameo with Vincent Price is a brilliant move - ah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah. On the flip side of things, Michael performs a benign duet with Beatle Paul to pretty decent effect. But \\"Human Nature\\" says something more about the human condition. It's just plain lovely. And the synths on the upbeat \\"Baby Be Mine\\" just might be proof of a heaven. These are all major things and they bring validation to the record's multi-platinum status.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hard enough to keep you interested, but not so hard that its impossible.  Similar to the 100 Floors game.  Love it!
B001JI7WTO|5.0|Fun family movie good graphics and story line makes you want to read good imagination cute characters would watch again
B0047SF41G|4.0|This is perfect movie to watch while hanging out with your significant other.  My fianc&eacute; and I watched it and didn't feel we missed a thing by talking through it a bit.  Good B-movie fun!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun and easy game. People of all ages can play it. It is the start to help you learn how to play mahjong.  ENJOY!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Brilliantly cast and sensitively played.  Enhanced my understanding of this syndrome.  I hope that is the correct word to use.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I like the show. It is very funny. I like all the things that happen to her. She is very hilarious
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The KING is back!  I enjoyed this book more then the past few books that Mr King has put out there for us.  If you haven't read The Shinning I suggest you read that first, even though Doctor Sleep will stand alone.  If you have read The Shinning I suggest you reread it to get yourself \\"there\\". I reread The Shinning and went right into Doctor Sleep and enjoyed every page.  For long time Stephen King fans this book is a must read.
B003YV64OI|5.0|When shopping for a CPU, it mainly comes down to price.  Being a technical person, I know that the processor is only one part of your computer.  If you have a weak CPU, with an extra couple gigs of memory and a good video card, you can get the more or less the same gaming performance as a $1,000 Alienware computer.  That configuration would get you more frames per second than an Xbox 360.  In fact, the new Xbox One and PS4 have about the same processing power as an Intel i5 and a midrange Nvidia graphics card.  Why do you think it's being sold for $499?  It's built on the exact same x86 platform.  If they put in a high-end i7 Intel chip, they would have to sell it for the same price as a high-end gaming PC.<br /><br />This CPU has been a rock solid piece of hardware.  It can stream HD and encode video with no problems.  I won't get bragging rights, but I don't usually brag about my processors anyway.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  It was a true story wasn't it?  I could watch it again and again and want to share.  I recorded it but I wanted a BluRay version.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Show nearby wi-fi networks. I don't really have a required use for it, but it's fun to see the crazy network names around town.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Could not have said it better.  Dawkins hits the high points in this Magnum opus.  Broaden your burka opening and begin to see the world as it is and be ready to be inspired by the possibility.  I don't know why Dawkins is considered a firebrand.  All that he presents is cool and well reasoned. If you don't get it it is because you lack the will to break from dogma.  Well done Dr Dawkins.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|I would give you more stars but they ran out, i guess we will definitely see you at the awards. Great album
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The original LotR movie trilogy was an astounding feat of cinematic glory. Perfectly cast, written, performed, and filmed. If you are looking for that magic to extend into the Hobbit prequel, you will be disappointed. It's about as different from the trilogy as the Star Wars prequels are from their original trilogy. It's like Peter Jackson took a holiday from actually caring about a good story.<br /><br />The film is much too long, but I can take long if it's good. The problem is...this movie is silly. The jokes are strained and Radagast the Brown is pretty much the Jar Jar Binks of the movie. I really wanted to like it, because some of the actors cast are really incredible, but they had nothing to work with. Hopefully the next two in the Hobbit trilogy recover somewhat from this disappointment, but I wouldn't count on it since they were all filmed at the same time.
0843135697|5.0|My 4-year old loves the Mr. Men series, but Mr. Rude is his favorite.  The storyline and illustrations are very similar to the animated series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm speechless and crying. I don't have anything to say other than the first sentence, but I'm required to have more than four words for this to post. John Green has rendered me speechless once again.
B003THJA1G|5.0|Castle is unfortunately or not something I did not watch during the seasons only got interested in reruns.  I have to say I am addicted.  The characters or interesting, funny and dramatic all things that I look for in a show.  Got my husband now watching!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham does it again. hard to put the book down as it has twists and turns. Fun reading. Go buy it !!!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Excellent book. Well developed characters.  A page turner to say the least.  This book would make an excellent book club read.  There's plenty to discuss.  It would also make a good movie for both men and women.<br /><br />Read it, try to guess the ending.  There's enough twists and turns to make it very intriguing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|There were no boring parts. The book kept you interested the whole way through. The ending came and you didn't want it to end. Leaves you wanting for the next book.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|I think its good but didnt have much use for it since the bluetooth headset itself never died on me yet....Maybe because its still quite new.  This charge case may have better use for me later when my batt gets weaker with age.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|I heard this on the radio recently and really liked the arrangements.  It is classic Doors at their best.  I bought the DVD of the concert also. I'm glad they finally made it available.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I used to play this game before I got my Kindle Fire (on the demo version in Staples ;) ) but now I have it, and I love it! It is completely worth the 99 cents. The tutorial is very helpful, unlike some other games. There are several levels so you don't become bored. I admit that there are a lot of ads, but they are only about other Cut the Ropes games. So, in the end, I say that you should buy this cute, fun game.
B0090O07S2|5.0|This is classic Doors.  I am so glad they brought it out on CD.  I never had the opportunity to see the Doors in person.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This is just sad.<br /><br />I've used Kik for 6 months and now?!?! It was working perfectly fine when I accidentally logged out. And I can't even log in or make a new account. I tried deleting it and downloading it several of times. My friends are going to think that I am avoiding them!!!<br /><br />I hope y'all fix this because then how am I supposed to talk to my friends without kik?!???!!
B00447G29S|5.0|Great movie, in 3D it's amazing.  Was really impressed with this movie.  The snowing falling is a really awesome effect.
B003UGLCIA|2.0|It had a lot of scratches on it and kept getting stuck, I would have to skip whole scenes to get it working again.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Took me about a week of casual play to beat it. Was fun while it lasted!!! Would consider buying a longer game.
B00E0SX118|5.0|My daughter and I loved it. I would recommend it for any age. She loves ot so much that she would watch it over and over.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|Nice game but way too much money--when I pay 9.99 I expect NOT to pay more to unlock decks and characters.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|To be completely honest, yes, this album doesn't sound like the \\"rock\\" and \\"pop punk\\" that Panic! is known for. It's exactly what the band has been saying it is, an tribute to their Vegas Roots. This album sounds very popish, and not very polished, and a lot more 80's inspired than anything else. It's exactly what Panic! At the Disco is known for, not being confined to one music style.  It sounds like Las Vegas. I personally love the sound of it, and my personal favorite song is This is Gospel. It's nothing like what you would expect from them, then again, if you've been following the band or are at least a fan of their music you'd know that what you expect is exactly what they don't give you. (Need I refer to the drastic style change between A Fever You Can't Sweat Out and Pretty Odd and then once again for Vices and Virtues?)<br /><br />Basically, I love it already.
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|I never made it to the big screen but knew I would rent it. It's good enough to watch but not for me to own.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had no idea that this was a follow up to The Shining, but even if you haven't read the other book (you should) you can still enjoy this one.  Being 6 years sober and having spent many hours in the &#34;rooms&#34;; the AA stuff was authentic.  A fantastic read---after all these years, he still has it!
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|i have not finished the series yet but i am enjoying the show and i love how easy it was to get
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I really liked the book. Good for all relationships. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about themselves and others.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I am an &#34;original&#34; Star Trek fan and still enjoyed this one and the previous one with Chris Pine. He does play a good Captain Kirk. I think all of the actors played their roles well bringing their own touch. I would not have enjoyed the movie if they tried to truly imitate their predecessors. As with the first plenty of action.<br />For any sci-fi fans this is a keeper.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Addictive! Can't seem to put it down. Hours of fun. Easy to win so it makes me feel great each time.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The gameplay is fun and addictive, with lots of replay potential given the added challenge of completing each level with every possible number of stars.  Nice graphics as well.  Runs smoothly on my nexus 7
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I find this app useful in some ways but cannot use it to it's full potential :-( could do with more advice about this app
B0087EACJK|5.0|This is a fantastic game and it runs extremely well on my Nexus 7.  Very creative game concept - you alternate between controlling the stick figure (like a side scroller) and pausing the stick figure action to control the environment (moving different environment tiles around for the figure to move between, rotating the direction of gravity).
B009AMAJVO|5.0|excellent movie, characters was great, especially the main characters, it was a unusual love story, it kept you on your toes. I watched it 3 times and have seen something that I didn't see before
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Riveting story.  I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I hope the movie does the book justice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it! Fun for my two boys and entertaining for mom.... don't forget dad, he loves it too! Makes me laugh!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Would definitely recommend to anyone who  likes shows that have a lot of family drama set in an older time period.
B00008CMR6|5.0|What can anyone say about John Wayne that hasn't already been said or written.  In the line of Westerns and Wayne movies, this is one enjoyable story.  The good vs. bad and the good guy coming out on top standing tall and proud.  I admit, I'm biased.  I am a John Wayne fan and think this is just another in a very long line of solid films that tell a good story.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A fun game that I can't stop playing when I am bored! Easy to understand controls and fun game play. Lots of levels from easy to harder. Try it!
B004V9MU86|5.0|The words flow out from this story with beautiful colour. It catches you and touches your soul. I loved this book.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Loved it. As always so many twists. Looking forward to more.  Can't wait to see the next one to see what happens !
B00CRJSWBQ|4.0|All works fine.<br /><br />Tricky to manually optimize; however, once optimized, works very smoothly and fast. New owners should be aware of processor cooling fan. Problem needs water cooled fan assembly to operate effectively during overclocking. Tower may be required depending on space.<br /><br />Tech support excellent if you can find their contact number on ASUS web site. Had to go to chat to get it. Once connected, no better tech support.
B00CW665VI|5.0|So enjoyed reading the the male POV, I laughed so hard in parts I snorted!  The writing was witty and sexy, I am really looking forward to see where these two are headed.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I've now completed all the levels of this game except for the bonus round in the fourth-and-final &#34;Crystal Mines&#34; world.  (The bonus rounds appear only after you have a 3-star rating on all the levels in a world.)  I've found the game to be quite entertaining, if sometimes frustrating--one slightly-off placement of a tool on the later levels, and there's no way to win, requiring that one start over...and some of the later levels can take more than 30 minutes to complete. Using the fast-forward switch is definitely necessary for one to enjoy the game. The obliviously waddling bunnies are amusing, but they're not THAT amusing when they're ambling slowly across several screens'-worth of layout, or gradually parachuting down from a height.  The high-quality animation keeps things from getting tedious too quickly (the bunnies are very cute), but the novelty does wear thin after a while.<br /><br />One of the most appealing aspects of this game is that there is more than one way to solve a level--all is NOT necessarily lost with a miscalculation.  There are usually more tools than needed, and they can be combined in unorthodox ways.  There do not seem to be any necessarily contrived solutions such as those found in some other games (e.g., open the bar, mix the orange juice and vodka, and use the resulting screwdriver to remove the access panel...) or unnecessary barriers to tool use (i.e., you can't use the pickaxe to break the mirror; you must use the hammer.)
B003TTKB5I|4.0|Its good enough to keep watching but its not &#34;edge of your seat&#34; drama. The characters are great and leave me wondering what will become of them.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book helped me understand so much. It spoke truth to my soul. Ii recommend it to everyone who would like to find meaning.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|too many ads in it.  i will probably delete it.  worse than some of the others. the game itself is fun.
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|This one keeps you guessing until the end!  I LOVE THAT!  Decades ago three young Mossad agents go to Germany to capture a terrible Nazi butcher of a man who escaped after the war.  They did successfully capture him, but their efforts to get him out of Germany....Ooops, I don't want to spoil any of this deliciously complex movie for you.  Jessica Chastain and Sam Worthington play two of the Mossad agents who have sexual chemistry that is palpable.  The three must make a life-altering decision that ends up haunting at least one of them.  The movie swings from this time period to the present when they are reunited because Jessica Chastain/Helen Mirren's daughter writes a book about their mission.  Sam Worthington displays acting chops worthy of an Academy Award.<br /><br />If you like intelligent, challenging films with stellar performances and ethical dilemmas, \\"The Debt\\" is the movie for you.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great series even after reading it the second time. Mr Card has a good imagination and great way to write when speaking from a child's point of view.
B00AEFYWJG|4.0|Edward Norton turns in an absolutely stellar performance which gives us all a glimpse of his acting genius to come.  He plays a young man accused (well, almost caught on video) of murdering a well-respected Catholic priest.  Richard Gere plays a media-hungry attorney who offers his services for free to Norton's character.  Laura Linney is the Prosecuting Attorney and does a wonderful job.  This movie has a number of twists that you never see coming.  They save the best one for last.<br /><br />A well-written story, well-paced directing, great musical score and excellent performances.  This is a must-see!
B00760BPOC|3.0|A little too long and meandering for my taste. Hurry up and get to the point please Mr Martin. The endless references to historical events and meticulously detailed descriptions of the scenery became a bit boring.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Best book to verter understand the sometimes gênios sometimes jerk iSteve. Thanks Walter for this MasterCard piece keek up the good job.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Ever. And this includes Breaking Bad, Dexter, Luther, I've seen all the greats... And loved all of them, but this show is stunning.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, well directed, brilliantly cast, fantastic character development, intelligent, makes you think and pay attention, riveting, un-compromising, artistic, refreshing.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Great book - such a lovely read.  The entire bookclub loved it.  One person described it as their book of the year.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was the best book. Great plot plus tons of 80's and video games references made for an exciting read and a nostalgic experience!!
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Great game, very addicting and fun. It has not froze once or glitched at all. the easy level is really easy. The medium level is challenging but the hard is VERY HARD. Enjoy.

B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Reading this short novella reminded me of why Steinbeck was a Nobel Prize winner and why he is still studied in most schools.  In a short novella he was able to develop characters and describe scenes so well that I envisioned the pond and the bunk house and could hear the characters voices as I read.

B008220BLG|5.0|It is more of a \\"girlfriend\\" type of movie but it's one a fellow doesn't mind watching too. Now that the Zombie Apocalypse is upon us it's cool :)
B000W7JWUA|3.0|The Settlers of Catan (Core Game), 2-4 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time: 30-45 Mins<br /><br />I still haven't decided if I like it or not. There is a luck element to it that I find hard to ignore yet there is some strategy in the placement of your cities and roads, as well as the thief should you roll a seven or draw a knight development card. I suppose I should stop there and explain the game before you begin scratching your heads.<br /><br />The board is broken up into hex pieces; each piece is separate from each other so that the board can be randomized in any way you'd like before the game starts. Each hex piece has a picture on it, representing a resource. There are five resources that you'll be collecting from these hexes: wool, lumber, grain, brick, and ore. After the board is assembled (via the recommended configuration in the manual or your own custom design) you'll place number chits on each hex. Whenever dice are rolled, players will look at the board to see which hex(es) that number represents. Players will earn resources for every settlement or city bordering that numbered hex. Resources are used to build settlements, upgrade settlements to cities, build roads, and buy development cards.<br /><br />Surrounding the outside of the hexes are harbor pieces that you also have to manually assemble, again, to allow for the possibility of customization. If a player has a settlement or city bordering a harbor, they gain a bonus to resource trading with the bank. A player would normally have to give up four resources to gain one resource of his or her choice, but the harbor cuts that harsh price down to say 2:1 or 3:1. Players are thus encouraged to trade with each other, if they agree to do so.<br /><br />The object of the game is to earn a set number of victory points before the other players do. Players earn victory points in a number of different ways. Building settlements or cities, having the longest road, and purchasing development cards (which have various effects) are the main ways to earn victory points.<br /><br />One thing I like about Settlers of Catan is that players can earn resources on anyone's turn. No matter who is currently rolling the dice for resources, all players earn resources depending on which number comes up and who has settlements or cities near that number.<br /><br />The thief element is interesting and is pretty crippling if placed on a hex you are actively earning resources from. When a player rolls a seven, they can place the thief token on any hex they want. Anyone who rolls that number will not earn resources should they have a settlement or city bordering that hex. Moving the thief onto a hex that borders an enemy settlement or city allows that player to steal a resource card from an enemy.<br /><br />I won't go into the rules in detail, but that pretty much sums up the game...start with and place two free settlements and roads, roll for resources, build more stuff, roll for resources, build more stuff, roll for resources, occasionally move a thief, roll for resources, build more stuff, roll for resources, build more stuff, occasionally (or regularly) purchase development cards...etc etc etc.<br /><br />Did I like it? I'm still on the fence as I've mentioned earlier. Having separate hexes and harbor pieces make the game very customizable, but the quality of the dock pieces are poor. The cardboard for the harbor pieces are warped and don't lay flat. Unless you're playing on a felt surface (or one which exhibits friction), bumping one hex will cause a chain reaction and cause the rest to slide under the harbor pieces on the outside. In theory, the harbor pieces are supposed to support the hexes and thus keep the playing board stable...mine do not.<br /><br />As I've mentioned, the pieces are separated and must be assembled prior to play...because of this, it took about five to ten minutes for me to get the hexes and the numbers that go on them all set up. The harbor pieces refused tosmooth out so I let them fold slightly and was just careful in not bumping a hex by accident.<br /><br />My son and I played the game in about half and hour...turns were quick and easy, most of the time we were waiting for the dice to roll a number for a hex that bordered one of our towns...this is where the luck factor kicks in. Even though you have a greater chance of rolling a seven than you do a ten, the dice determines when you get resources. You could do the math and put your settlements near all the numbers with the best odds of being rolled but random chance can still factor into play. I'm personally not someone who likes random chance.<br /><br />Overall the game is good and I'd recommend it for those that want a relatively quick to moderate resource game which has a mix of both strategy and luck. My son expressed his desire to play it again in the future, I just haven't figured out yet if he is only saying that because he won. There are numerous expansions out there that adds more features and players to the standard two to four player game.smooth out so I let them fold slightly and was just careful in not bumping a hex by accident.<br /><br />My son and I played the game in about half and hour...turns were quick and easy, most of the time we were waiting for the dice to roll a number for a hex that bordered one of our towns...this is where the luck factor kicks in.

B005DF2QMC|3.0|It looks like an old Walk Man, and functions the same way. While the production quality (tone, volume, etc.) is acceptable (the sound is coming from old cassette tapes after all), operationally there are some limitations. First, it seems that if you want to do a track-by-track transfer, you need to make individual recordings and transfer them separately. Second, if you are satisfied with copying one entire side at a time, you need to save the recording for each side separately on your computer individually -- when I tried to use the reverse play mechanism, the sound from the other side seeped into the side I was trying to record.<br /><br />I also had some difficulty transferring to I Tunes, but that may have been because of my technical inability as opposed to the machine.<br /><br />Lack of ease of use makes this of less than terrific value, but I have managed to salvage a couple of dozen of my old tapes into a digitial format at a price far less than that of this machine.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Zombie Dice: 2+ Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 10-20 Minutes<br /><br />Zombie Dice is incredibly easy to play and it won't take long for newcomers to the game to grasp the rules.  The components are sturdy and the graphics on the dice are easy to make out.  The manual is laid out well and explains the rules nicely, though after a playthru or two, you won't need it.<br /><br />The \\"press your luck\\" mechanic keeps things pretty interesting and it's fun to see how each player responds to the situation in front of them.  Some players might stop at two, or even one shotgun blast to keep the one or two brains they have while others might take a more risky approach and roll on absolutely anything.<br /><br />One might not think that there isn't strategy in Zombie Dice, but the fact that the dice are colored with three different difficulty levels makes one pause to consider the odds.  A player who has had a run of good luck but has been drawing green and yellow dice from the can might be hesitant to keep going as the odds of drawing red dice increase.  Red dice have more shotguns and less brains on their faces, so it's important to consider not only your current standing in that turn but also the dice that are left to be drawn.  There are no guarantees that the green dice will be kind to you, but the odds are much better that they will be.<br /><br />The kids had fun with it.  Vinnie (11) is in a zombie phase where he loves everything zombie and probably got the biggest kick out of playing the game.  Anthony (16) was less reckless than Vinnie, taking into account dice colors and odds.  Both took sadistic enjoyment out of watching me roll three shotguns on my first or second roll.  I was probably the most cautious of the three, stopping when I could simply because dice and I never get along.  It's well-known in my house that the odds of me rolling something bad is equivalent to the odds of a redshirt getting knocked off in an episode of Star Trek.<br /><br />Zombie Dice is a fast and fun game to play with friends and family.  The play mechanics will make you think each turn, keeping you actively engaged from start to finish.  Its short to average play time makes it ideal as a filler in between longer games and serves well as a quick pull-out-and-play kind of game on hectic school nights.  All in all, it's a wonderful dice game to add to your collection.Dice is a fast and fun game to play with friends and family.

B005FDW7AI|5.0|Having grown up with Shirley Temple's &#34;A Little Princess&#34; I was a little skeptical about this remake.  I have to say, this was a stunningly beautiful movie!  It is so nice to watch a movie and be reminded about what is important in life and to follow our dreams and to be kind to one another.  I can watch this movie over and over and never tire of it.

1119963192|5.0|Not a great read for those looking for a story, but excelent for those trying to beter their siwm. It covers just about everything, and has something for everyone, and for an instructional book it's written well. I was amazed to find what I was doing wrong for years, even some things I've read in other books, and have a new positive outlook because of it.

B00DONM9AE|5.0|This product is really nice. It's not too big either. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. The package was delivered on time but it was delivered to the wrong house! I had to walk next door and receive it from my neighbor's hand. Overall it looks really nice, nothing seems to be out of place, like a rip.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Excellent read. It was one of those books that I couldn't wait to pick back up, and stayed up too late reading. Worth reading.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Convoluted set of plots woven together to provide background for the future events we have already seen.  Well cast and well directed to yield a very enjoyable motion picture.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|always a good watch!<br />always on the edge of my seat!<br />not sure how the writers make you fall in love with a serial killer and hope that he gets away with it...genius writing on their part!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watch it from the beginning and get caught up before the next season begins in America in January 2014.  You will not regret it.  You will become a fan forever.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I'm unscrupulous about the music I enjoy, and Korn has written more than enough great songs over the years to earn my continued listening. With \\"The Paradigm Shift\\" Korn returns to their roots with great guitar riffs and heavier vocals... Sure, there's some new stuff presented here (people change!) but anybody listening objectively will find lots to love. Davis' lyrics are far more mature than they used to be, and I the catchiness of the melodies is off the charts.<br /><br />Bottom line: Head is back with the band that made him famous, and Korn sounds as good as ever!

B009JZWO3I|5.0|I'm a big fan. The story line continued with believability and the season finally really had me fooled. Diane's character traits seem to fluctuate at times but so do most people's. :)

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Sensitive story of a girl who goes through the child welfare/foster parent system and gradually allows herself to be loved.  Added to this complicated story is the love of flowers and the symbolism that flowers can be used to express that dates back to Victorian times.
0345347951|5.0|TL;DR: Wow.<br /><br />Although there's bound to be a few of you who have already read this classic, I will try to avoid spoilers. If you want the 30,000-foot view of the story, you can read the back cover blurb. I'm making this review more about its spirit rather than its text.<br /><br />When my wife asked me what it was about, I should have just cut to the chase, handed her the book and said, \\"Here.\\"<br /><br />We've all read books that were difficult to summarize, but often because they're rife with confusing plots, an overabundance of characters, and poor writing.<br /><br />This was different. My brain was churning thought-butter faster than my tongue could lap it up. I stumbled over ideas and metaphors, characters and plot points, all while trying to explain how they were linked. And the more I tried to just spit the damned words out, the more I realized my brain was forming new connections.<br /><br />Childhood's End is so many books in one, and by that I don't mean it's a rat's nest of stories. More a symphony of motifs and symbols. The beauty of such a notion is that one can appreciate the overall story while a keen eye can also appreciate the contribution of each component. That includes not just the notes, but the spaces in between.<br /><br />Amid a sea of concepts, the book explores the great contradiction of humankind: His search for control over his own destiny and simultaneous desire to be taken care of. It doesn't shy away from metaphysical questions and the mind-body conundrum. Ideas of space and time also permeate the text.<br /><br />This would be a hell of a book if written today, but I try to imagine what it must have been like coming across such a thing in the 1950s. It can't help but have some parts which reveal it as a product of its time (something was \\"faxed\\" to a spaceship), but really, how much can we fault the author who may have inspired the telecommunication satellite?<br /><br />This is one of a precious few books that I can't wait to re-read. I want to give the story more time to soak in so that I can come at it with a fresher perspective, but I plan on pulling it out again next year. I can't recommend it  enough. Even if you're not a fan of science-fiction, it deserves a top spot in your TBR pile.to re-read.

B00ECR7L0Y|4.0|First of all, if you can't past the idea of using the original William Shakespeare text in modern times, nothing will probably make you like this film.  I personally think it was a bold choice.  The works of \\"The Bard\\" have endured for centuries for a reason.  There are MANY examples of films adapting Shakespeare, many of them great (Forbidden Planet, 10 Things I Hate About You, Gnomeo & Juliet, just off the top of my head).  Whedon seems to be saying, let's let the words speak for themselves.  He then chose to put the words into the mouths of what Joss Whedon fans will recognize as a \\"Dream Cast.\\"  I've been saying for many years that Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof (as bickering lovers Beatrice and Benedick) should be bigger stars.  And while Whedon's film didn't exactly make them household names, it does put the pair front and center where they belong.  And who doesn't love \\"Avengers\\" and \\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\" actor Clark Gregg?  He makes acting look effortless, even in the strange tongue used here.  Add Nathan Fillion and \\"Buffy\\"'s Tom Lenk for some great comedy and \\"Firefly\\"'s Sean Maher in a rare villain role, and you've really got something.<br /><br />In the (22 min.) documentary, Whedon offers his justification for the choices he made--shooting in black & white, casting and location.  I think my favorite part is when Nathan Fillion gushes about Gregg: \\"I just watched him in that scene and I thought, 'So THAT's how it's done.'\\"  There are also commentary tracks with the director and cast, but I haven't watched them (as much as I love learning about how films are made, I usually get bored quickly with those).<br /><br />Like I said above, if you can accept the ancient dialects, it's really a very good adaptation.  The themes of the film--the joys and absurdities of love--are universal.  I don't consider myself well-read on Shakespeare, but the story was easy to follow.  Certainly, if you're a fan of Whedon and his cast, this is a must-see.
B00594XOZU|3.0|What on earth? I got this app, and I thought, hey, how awesome! My friend said I should get it so we could text. It works on her kindle, but it doesn't work on mine! start reading because Ijust got it and really haven't have it a good try yet.<br />It won't register. My mom got kik on her tablet and it worked fine. I gave it a three star rating because I really haven't used it a whole lot yet.<br /><br />I say, if you are an impatient person, don't get this app.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I was disappointed with this Summer's action movies.  Iron Man 3?  Meh.  Star Trek Into Darkness?  Disappointed.  Man of Steel?  Didn't even see it.<br /><br />But Pacific Rim... ROCKED.<br /><br />I did not watch this film like a 40-year-old expecting Academy Award level writing and acting.  I went into the film as a 12-year-old who loves robots and giant monsters.  And boy howdy, it delivers!<br /><br />Great action sequences, fantastic monsters and robots, humor, drama, and Ron Perlman just because it's a Guillermo Del Toro movie.  It was everything I was hoping for.<br /><br />To all the haters out there: What were you expecting from a movie with giant robots and monsters?  Shakespeare?
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Very gentle read, well written and beautiful descriptions of a middle aged couple's journey. The transitions of life exposed and solved.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of the most intense and realistic aerial combat books I've read.  You're there with each gunner, pilot and co-pilot, and essentially every member of the crew.  Same is true with Franz, the German fighter pilot featured in this book.  Couple of times I had to put the book down and walk away.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|excellent use of what I call sci-fact to tell her stories.  this is third (and, sadly, final) installment of this series (see Oryx & Crake, and The Year of the Flood) -- LOVE this series.  memorable characters (good and bad guys), humor and wit throughout, but serious when it needs to be; covers a wide range of human experience, emotions, reactions, intellect, gender issues, etc.  the psychology of her characters is present throughout, but in a good way ;-)  highly recommend the series.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I installed this app on my Kindle fire tablet and thought it would be something nice to have when I wanted to listen to some mp3 songs.  It started to sync inmediately, and downloading songs.  At first I thought they were some sample songs that normally come with new apps and services, but imagine my surprise when I found out that those songs belonged to CD's I had puchased in Amazon several years ago!!  I didn't see anything during the app presentation before installing it that would tell me this was to happen, so this was a very pleasant surprise to me.  Thank you Amazon !!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|A memoir to be enjoyed by everyone, but probably moreso for women.  Tina Fey presents an interesting life with good humor.  Some humor is laugh-out-loud, and some is more contemplative.  One does not have to be a fan of SNL to enjoy the explication of the show--it's still funny.<br /><br />The book is an easy read and is well worth the time.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|You know the drill: Book comes out and a movie is made...not a good movie. Well, this was really well done! I don't want to give away the storyline, but the realness of the characters was enough to challenge my dear wife into NOT wanting to relive the bad-guy part of the story. It was heart-pounding suspense...even though we had read the book... The surprise at the end is worth all the (reading) watching!
1401242855|1.0|Don't buy this if you're looking for the Hardcover. It's paperback and not Hardcover as described. Will be returning. Amazon has consistently been getting worse at listing Paperbacks as Hardcovers, I'll return every paperback I get when expecting a Hardcover.

B00E9P957Q|3.0|Have to agree with the other reviewers about the packaging. Having all the CDs in one box with sleeve covers is nice but not including the original credits and booklets exposes a label that doesn't understand the audience for their act. Rush fans are about the whole package: music, art, credits, lyrics - it's all important. Anyone can buy the original discs used for the same cost per disc as picking up this set. \\"Casual\\" fans (if there is such a thing when it comes to Rush) probably won't shell out even the bargain price this set is offered for since they probably don't like every album in the set. Unlike the collectors who WILL buy this box to get yet another set of remasters but no artwork and booklets this time. Sorry, Atlantic, but ultimately this is a letdown. Great job with the actual CDs and music, though, so credit where credit is due.

B002N44XSG|5.0|Perfect companion to any book in the Percy Jackson series!!! Can't wait for the House of Hades!!!!! A definite read.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|this unique and well written book taught me a lot about inhumanity and horrors of North Korea.  The story of the hero of the book, a slave from birth and his remarkable escape  are touching yet very, very sad.  A must read!

B0083ZM4TO|5.0|Many people remember where they were when Mother Theresa died. I was only young at the time, but I recall my parents speaking about her and her Nobel Peace prize among other things.<br /><br />Considering the incredible praise she managed in her lifetime, I am rather pleased with this &#34;pamphlet&#34;, by Hitchens. He writes at his best here, with an unrelenting barrage of clear writing.<br /><br />Some may find the topic a little much, and some may scorn Hitchens for attacking a soft target. I personally don't believe she is a soft target (dead or not), and I think her extraordinarily zealous attitude on topics such as abortion, divorce and suffering deserve to be remembered and not excused. It is worth remarking (as Hitchens does) that Mother Theresa was quite happy to discuss these views at length, and it is extraordinary that no one ever recalls some of the rather horrible things the woman said.<br /><br />I would recommend this to everyone, but it would be of particular value to those passionate about debating and journalism.

B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This is a good app for reviewing a language that you may have previously learned, but if you are starting from scratch, it will be confusing.  The lessons use terms that are not in the previous lessons and not set up in a way to allow you to know what they mean.  You can eventually catch up, but it may take several attempts before moving on.
B005T4SW7K|5.0|Neil MacGregor certainly provided a rich and insightful history of humanity and I enjoyed the way he told each story. Anyone interested in history, human development, science and where we came from and may be going would love this book.<br />I never always found the connection and flow between objects but rather felt he wanted to cover the globe and give everyone a fair chance. It never lessened the enjoyment and I suppose it made it easy to put it down and come back to again after a break.

B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|If you don't particularly like Cher, well, you probably won't like this album, but if you're anywhere on the spectrum from liking her to loving her, and you enjoy dance tracks or ballads, you WILL really enjoy this album.  For the younger (or young-ish) generation familiar with Cher circa mid 90's to now and into dance-pop, highly-produced, vocoderized/synthesized tunes (I'm one of them, they will not be disappointed with the first half of the album - the techno/pop dance portion.  All of these are are good danceable, hummable tunes and are all candidates for remixes. They will have your feet tapping (much to the chagrine of your fellow morning subway riders whether you want to or not.......(\\"My Love\\" and \\"I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream\\" are my personal favorites.....good, fun tunes on their own that are just waiting to be remixed by Freemasons, David Guetta or Benny Bennasi, maybe mixing in I Feel Love or The Chase by G. Moroder). And i must admit that I'm pleasantly surprised she was able to pull this off again with dance tracks.<br /><br />However for me, it's those knockout \\"well where the heck did THAT come from????\\" ballads!!!  That's the second half of the album.  They blew me away, and I'll be listening to them over and over again.  \\"I Hope You Find It\\" and \\"Lie to Me\\" are two particular standouts. And \\"Sirens\\".......simply beautiful with haunting melodies.  Girl, WHERE did you pull these songs from?!?!  And she sounds simply AMAZING.  Hitting those long, high notes without a break.  I repeat....GREAT, strong vocals.
B003JTHWPA|4.0|This was a very sad story but it kept my interest to the end. It was so interesting to see the deaf character blend with all the different people in his life. He was always there for them but they couldn't see his torments. I think it was beautifully written  and it was easy to understand why a movie was developed. I can see why it is rated as a &#34;classic&#34;.

B00EQ30RVY|4.0|When Stone Temple Pilots fired Scott Weiland this past March most fans pretty much thought that was it. For over 20 years Weiland has been the face and voice of STP and the idea of the band continuing on without him seemed absurd. Sure, some bands like AC/DC or Van Halen have changed lead singers, but for STP to do so, so far in their career seemed impossible. While the DeLeo brothers and Eric Kretz are very talented, I Personally thought that a Weiland-less Stone Temple Pilots would be like the post Bach-Skid Row, a band that was just a shell of its former self--playing to half-empty bars and releasing little heard new music to an apathetic, dwinding fanbase. And that's probably what would have happened to STP had they not recruited a big name singer--someone contemporary who might even bring in some new fans. Luckily Stone Temple Pilots were able to score a major coup with the addition of Linkin Park's Chester Bennington.<br /><br />To be honest, I was not overly enthusiastic when Bennington was announced as the band's new singer as I was never a huge Linkin Park fan--was just never really into the whole Nu-Metal thing or most 00s rock in general. I am also a huge Scott Weiland fan and didn't really want to see the band continue without him. That said, I decided to give the new line-up a chance. The band were smart to release a new single, \\"Out of Time,\\" as soon as the announcement of Bennington as their new singer was made as it would give the band a chance to, as the clich&eacute; goes, \\"let the music do the talking\\" and also maybe reduce the handwringing from fans eager to hear what the new version of Stone Temple Pilots might sound like.<br /><br />\\"Out of Time\\" is the first song on the band's new EP \\"High Rise\\" (2013), the first new material from the band since 2010's self-titled album. My initial response to \\"Out of Time\\" was \\"not bad.\\"  While it might be a by-the-numbers STP rocker, it's really what the band needed--a good, meat-and-potatoes 90s-sounding rock song in the vein of vintage STP. While not an instant classic like \\"Plush\\" or \\"Interstate Love Song,\\" it's a good song. The boogie-rocker \\"Black Heart\\" is another catchy song that sounds a little bit like \\"Days of the Week\\" from the band's fifth album \\"Shangri-La Dee Da\\" (2001) and the Beatles \\"Get Back.\\" The melodic, radio friendly \\"Same on the Inside\\" is probably the catchiest song on the EP and I'm a bit surprised that the band didn't choose that as their new single--it could easily get some airplay. \\"Cry Cry\\" sounds like the most vintage STP to me, maybe because Bennington seems to be channeling Weiland in terms of his delivery, especially those background harmonies--Still, it's a great song--catchy as hell, melodic and rocking. The closing \\"Tomorrow\\" sounds a bit like an updated, poppy \\"Still Remains\\" and makes for a good closer.<br /><br />While initially pessimistic about STP going on without Weiland, I got to say, I love this EP. \\"High Rise,\\" overall, sounds a little reminiscent of \\"Tiny Music\\" (1996) era STP and the Talk Show (1997) album (the lone album that the DeLeo brothers and Kretz made with singer Dave Coutts).  The new lineup have recorded five really good, well-crafted songs that fans of the band's more pop-sounding, latter work should like. There isn't anything groundbreaking about this EP, but it is very, very good. Chester has won me over and clearly has chemistry with the DeLeo brothers and Kretz. Hopefully new EPs or a new album will be forthcoming.g in the vein of vintage STP. While not an instant classic like \\"Plush\\" or \\"Interstate Love Song,\\" it's a good song. The boogie-rocker \\"Black Heart\\" is another catchy song that sounds a little bit like \\"Days of the Week\\" from the band's fifth album \\"Shangri-La Dee Da\\" (2001) and the Beatles \\"Get Back.\\" The melodic, radio friendly \\"Same on the Inside\\" is probably the catchiest song on the EP and I'm a bit surprised that the band didn't choose that as their new single--it could easily get some airplay. \\"Cry Cry\\" sounds like the most vintage STP to me, maybe because Bennington seems to be channeling Weiland in terms of his delivery, especially those background harmonies--Still, it's a great song--catchy as hell, melodic and rocking. The closing \\"Tomorrow\\" sounds a bit like an updated, poppy \\"Still Remains\\" and makes for a good closer.<br /><br />While initially pessimistic about STP going on without Weiland, I got to say, I love this EP. \\"High Rise,\\" overall, sounds a little reminiscent of \\"Tiny Music\\" (1996) era STP and the Talk Show (1997) album (the lone album that the DeLeo brothers and Kretz made with singer Dave Coutts).  The new lineup have recorded five really good, well-crafted songs that fans of the band's more pop-sounding, latter work should like. There isn't anything groundbreaking about this EP, but it is very, very good. Chester has won me over and clearly has chemistry with the DeLeo brothers and Kretz. Hopefully new EPs or a new album will be forthcoming.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I started reading Stephen King when he first published and I was just a teenager.  He has written wonderful stuff and he has written crap.  This is a good story and very glad he decided to bring Danny back.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

B00EY8A6BC|1.0|I ordered it, I paid close to $5.00 for it, but it never showed up on my tivo, so I guess it SHOULD be no stars, since we never even saw it show up.  It's going to be a hassle no doubt to try and rectify this, so not looking forward to hassling about that.
0451196716|4.0|I think I read this years ago, but it wasn't on my shelf (I save all my King and Koontz books to reread) so had to buy it to reread or maybe read for the first time.  King has many good books (and a few stinkers) but I find I have to read them all and go from there.

140006922X|5.0|I did not have much religious training as a child so much of this book was new information for me. I read it through once, went back and highlighted it and now I'm making notes. I wish there was a class on this book so I could study it with a group and become &#34;fluent&#34; in the history, culture, economics, religion, politics and more of this time and place. It's one of the most extraordinary books I have ever read. So much written about this time, place and person is way too academic for me to wade through. This book is not. If I can understand it, I think everyone could.
B001BEK8E2|4.0|I have been a fan of the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa for many years. His list of films he directed are all well known and admired by movie fans all over the world. Many are considered masterpieces including films like \\"Seven Samurai\\", \\"Ikiru\\" and \\"Ran\\" among them. The 1950 film \\"Rashomon\\" is another one considered a masterpiece by many. It was probably the first major movie to be made by Kurosawa after the end of World War II.<br /><br />I consider it an almost masterpiece. That is I like this film but don't feel it is ranks up there among he other masterpieces. Before seeing it for the first time I had read a lot about \\"Rashomon\\". Most of it with glowing reviews. So when I saw it for the first time while I did enjoy watching it and was caught up it in the story I was at the same time slightly disappointed in it. It seemed to me to lack a little bit in being called a masterpiece. I found I wasn't quite as caught up in the story or in the characters the way I was in watching other Kurosawa movies. In fact after the first time I watched it I felt even a little let down by the experience. After a couple of more viewings of \\"Rashomon\\" my opinion began to be more favorable towards it. Still for me \\"Rashomon\\" is just a near masterpiece.<br /><br />That is not to say the story to the film is not interesting because it is and very unique. The story itself takes place in 12th century Japan. A murder and rape has taken place but what exactly happened? We don't see the actual events as they occur. Instead after the body has been found and reported to the police the viewer is then presented with four different versions of what happened. We first hear from the road bandit, who is accused of both the rape and murder that took place, as to what happened. Then we hear from the wife of the murdered man who tells what she saw and how she was raped. Then in an interesting twist in the story we hear from a medium who the murdered man is speaking through who tells what occurred. Finally we hear from the woodcutter who found the body originally and who in fact may have seen just what had happened. The whole premise to the movie is just what is truth and who is telling it in \\"Rashomon\\". One version must be the right version of what just did happened. If so does that mean everyone else is lying as to what happened? Or is it that between all or some of the versions does the truth appear in bits and pieces leaving the viewer to take the parts from each version to form one whole truth? Or if you really want to get philosophical does everyone have their own idea just what truth is or is it human nature for people to lie? In that regard the film does prove interesting and compelling for the viewer to watch so they can put together just what they think the truth, as well as truth itself, really is. This is a movie that can get you thinking. At the same time there is some action to it as the road bandit and the murdered man, a samurai, get into a sword fight. There even is a touch of comedy in it. One of the versions of the sword fight scene becomes a little bit humorous in its portrayal as both men act like they want to kill each other while at the same time trying to run away.<br /><br />Two things that do make this movie worth the viewing is the acting and the cinematography. The cast of \\"Rashomon\\" is first rate with some of the best Japanese actors to appear in it. It is lead by Kurosawa's favorite actor over the years Toshiro Mifune who is the road bandit. I would rate this as one of Mifune's finest performances in his career. The cinematography is groundbreaking which helps to bring life to the movie with camera angles and unique shots which would become influential in other future movies by other directors.<br /><br />This is a movie everyone should watch at least once. Maybe if you do you will consider \\"Rashomon\\" a masterpiece as many others do. I will admit while I was a bit disappointed in it the first time I watched \\"Rashomon\\" it has grown on me little by little in subsequent viewings. If I had written a review after the first time I had seen \\"Rashomon\\" I probably would not have given it more then a 3 star rating. Now after a couple more times watching I have found the film to be a 4 star picture. Who knows, after a couple more times I might go all the way and give it 5 stars. The main thing is to give yourself a chance to see \\"Rashomon\\" and form your own opinion on it and how many stars you believe it is worth.n me little by little in subsequent viewings.

B008MWBY6W|4.0|I received this as a bundled package (including a 16GB SD card) with my D3200. The case is well made, with two side pockets and two front pockets. There is a handle on top, as well as a nice shoulder strap. There are two straps inside the bag that velco to the sides to hold the camera aloft so it's not sitting on the lens. There is a little room under the camera, but I wouldn't count on putting anything besides a camera with the attached lens in the main compartment. The case is really for limited carrying; there's not room for lots of things. The front pockets have some smaller plush velco pockets (for SD cards) and other tiny implements.<br /><br />Two things I wish of this case:<br />An extra way to carry the case, possibly with a belt strap on the backside.<br />Slightly larger side pockets; they are only really useful with thin items.<br /><br />Overall, it will serve me well protecting my camera. If necessary, I can place this bag into a larger bag to carry around.
B0071BGOJC|2.0|Initially I found it difficult to remember who was who and where that person fitted in the story.<br />The number of people from all over the globe who somehow got connected and, just by coincidense, had parents or grandparents that had also been connected one or two generations ago, were just too many to make the plot believable.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie has a great twist and is an awesome flick. recommend to anyone who enjoys twists and turns. Blu ray is a must for this one!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I admit that I am late to the game, but this is a great show. Watch it and find out for yourself.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Movies are good when they get you interested in the characters and have you caring about what happens to them.  This did just that for me.  I cared about the boys Ellis and Neckbone, and even though we know Mud isn't all good, I cared about what happened to him as well.  I have a feeling that the young boy who played Ellis - Tye Sheridan - is going to be a household name one day.  Definitely worth the $4.99 to rent and I would have gladly paid the $9.00 to see it in the theater as well.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Typical hollywood action offering.  A little more thought out on the plot than most.<br />Enjoyed the flick, rental was reasonable
B005LAIIN0|4.0|I say \\"surprisingly good\\" because I'm not the biggest Brad Pitt fan, and I'm kinda done with any and every zombie and vampire movie, show, comic book, etc.  I watched it anyway, as open-minded as possible, and hey, World War Z is a smart zombie thriller!<br /><br />Pitt plays a retired U.N. Special Envoy, having travelled around the world investigating for the U.N. and surviving who knows what while doing it.  Logically, in a zombie outbreak, he might be someone you want to locate and empower to help find out how it started.<br /><br />Pitt's character bounces around the world, watching society crumble as he goes, doing his best to remain calm and think critically through it all, as do many of the characters he interacts with (Spoiler Alert): I especially liked the Harvard virologist's speech about nature as a mass-murderer, and the Mossad agent's explanation of the \\"Tenth Man,\\" and how Jerusalem reacted correctly to an intercepted Indian report of \\"Zombies.\\"  All of the main characters' motivations are believable and relatable.<br /><br />Just what some reviewers are saying about how terrible this movie is, I don't know.  Maybe they're Pitt haters, don't like zombies, turned off by the gore, etc (can't have zombies without gore, c'mon).  World War Z is a well-written, well-acted, and well-executred zombie movie.  Kudos to Pitt for his acting and producing in this.  The only thing that bugged me were the sometimes distractingly obvious CG zombies, but CG is often overused these days (in my opinion).  I recommend you check it out.<br /><br />One more thing, the Blu Ray picture is beautiful.

0553251023|4.0|Note: I don't consider the below review to have \\"spoilers\\" since the killer and some of his characteristics are revealed very early in the book.<br /><br />While this book includes both Albert Campion and Superintendent Charlie Luke (with cameos of Oates & Yeo), it's not a whodunit, though there is some mystery as to how they try and catch the killer.  Mostly it's a thriller--esp. regarding several nice people and their relationships with the killer--who is easily identified early in the book.  It's been compared with [[ASIN:1934609579 The Tiger in the Smoke: Albert Campion #14]] which includes another \\"serial killer\\" though today it might not be considered so serial in that the killer's motivations are more mundane--as Allingham says in [[ASIN:1934609277 The Fashion in Shrouds: Albert Campion Mystery #10]] page 338, \\"He's got exalted ideas of his own importance.  A lot of them have...They honestly think a bit of their cash or a bit of their convenience is worth someone else's life.\\"  Yet, his psychology is explored a bit in this book--especially against several foils both young and old.  But, perhaps the most interesting character from a psychological point of view is Aunt Polly and her very odd relationship with Gerry.  This is particularly evident at the very end of the book.  The bond between the two is remarkable, though difficult to comprehend.  A good example where rationalization overpowers cognitive dissonance--a prevalent, though unfortunate characteristic of humans brought to an extreme herein.<br /><br />However, on a somewhat happier note, the interaction of Gerry and Richard is interesting, enlightening, and perhaps even humorous.  While Allingham inserts a considerable amount of cleverness regarding Gerry's activities, alibis, etc., the main thrust of the novel is in the characterizations, especially in the psychology of human interactions of normal people with rather unusual (fortunately) people.

The characters were well written and the story line intense... I couldn't put it down!

B008JFUO36|5.0|I had no plans to follow through with this movie. Lately every movie I've been waiting to go to DVD has let me down. The previews rock my world only to find I can't sit through fifteen minutes. Grrh! Oblivion had a couple things going for it before I even pressed play. Science fiction and Tom Cruise. I live for end of the world survival drama and Tom's been one of my favorite actors since Legend.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a 12 Monkeys vibe because the opening scene is a glimpse of the past. Tell me you all saw that movie. It is one of the best of all time. The pacing is slow with long looks and minimal dialogue, but the tech is sleek and sexy. Everything is white or feels white, clean, even the ruins, but then darkness and unknowns are thrown in, which is the least flashy way a movie can create conflict and I loved it. Quiet spooky stuff. Then the music came into play, and I was thrown into a Terminator vibe. Very futuristic everyone is going to die via machine kind of way. I loved it! I was completely creeped out. Tom played one of his most subdued roles ever, almost funny at times. Morgan Freemen excels at that and he did here too. There's a mystery to be solved, humanity to save, and the last man on earth to get laid. Okay, Tom's not the last man on earth, but here he is getting some and the world has ended! That was a little too much, but at least it was very understated, which pays respect to how sci-fi movies should be. Except when it comes to the modern version of Battlestar Galatica. They had the best sex scenes.<br /><br />4.5 stars for Oblivion and I'm sure I'll watch it again because it's that cool. One more movie vibe reference. Wall-E. Weird, but let me know if you see what I'm saying here.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I listen to the CDs from the movie series at work and it makes me want to have a Lord of the Rings movie-a-thon over the weekend.  Excellent quality sound.  Well worth the price.  I bought all three movie sound-track CDs.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I really liked the story. CBK's work is well researched with just the right amount of hope. There was much happiness and plenty of heartache but it's cleverly inter-twined to make the story that much more enjoyable. It reads very quickly and kept me glued to the pages wanting to see what would happen. I would have given it a 5-star if I could have allowed my teen daughter to read it. However, there are a few scenes describing  teen \\"encounters\\" that I find inappropriate and actually unnecessary to the story line. But, over 18, it's a nice read.
B008TRH5N6|4.0|I liked the concept in the book.  It takes a lot of practice to work your subconscious mind. The author has a list of the suggestions  at the end of each chapter to refer to. This helps to fortify the process of training the subconscious.
0307352153|5.0|Interesting analysis of why we act as we do. Being an Introvert isn't a negative thing, it's a way we react to life. Loved getting to know myself better and why I do what I do and how I react now to situations that used to bother me.
B0085TJUGI|2.0|You can probably pull 4 or 5 good quote-worthy things out of this book. Towards the end, it gets a bit preachy, even almost fiction-like. Just google her story and it will be the condensed version of this book and save you some money.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite drama/romance movies.  I honestly can't say that list is long but I like how the movie is done.  It feels very real to watch their relationship start out so strong and then to see the moments in between when you can tell it probably just isn't going to work.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I listen to the CDs from the movie series at work and it makes me want to have a Lord of the Rings movie-a-thon over the weekend.  Excellent quality sound.  Well worth the price.

It turns out there are a lot of people out there who enjoy the movie sound-track series as much as I do.

B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|A must have reference. Scott gives you a step by step pathway to your understanding of a feature packed application.
1449325947|4.0|Thoroughly covers a wide range of topics in clear language, not overly dense and complex, but not dumbed down and verbose like the &#34;for dummies&#34; series. it contains enough information in it that you're getting you money's worth (which is a complaint I have with many beginner's books -- that they're just an intro but don't give enough room to grow).<br />I think it's a good balance of clarity and conciseness and breadth vs. depth; works well for people who are technically savvy and have a little general background on CSS but no real experience using it. The author mentions in the beginning that he assumes the reader has some HTML knowledge (which I have, from years ago).<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone who has a little background on HTML who's looking to get into using CSS, whether you want to go through the book from start to finish and work on all the exercises and experiment until you know it well, or just flip through looking for the topics you're interested in.

193413712X|5.0|A wee bit of a slow and meandering start, this book blossoms into a lovely, perfectly-rendered tale.  We may not share the circumstances of the characters, but we certainly share their yearnings, their shortcomings, their joys, their sorrows and their unfulfilled desires.  The degree of description may put off some readers who are anxious to get to the meat of a story, but this book has to me considered more poetry than prose.  Some passages and whole pages need to be read more than once.  Each reader will encounter those passages that speak most directly to her or him.  This is a book not to be read while waiting at the dentist's office or during a noisy lunchroom break.  It is best enjoyed in a quiet place, suitable for contemplation.

0399159347|5.0|There's a reason we call it Women's Fiction. It comes with a caveat: Guys, don't bother. A novel like this, you simply will not understand.<br /><br />On the other hand...<br /><br />Ladies, if you love a novel that makes you wonder how a stranger climbed inside your head and heart to see your innermost fears and hopes...and then wrote them down and turned them into a book....<br /><br />This one's for you.<br /><br />Not that The Husband's Secret is your story. It's certainly not mine. But the characters...the depth of their emotions as they journey across the pages...you will relate. You will soar and despair and then rise again. That's what happened to me, anyway.<br /><br />Liane Moriarty knows what she's doing. The level of creative energy she must have poured into the crafting of these incredibly unique characters...well, it makes my head ache just imagining it. She sketches exquisite, soul-touching moments of pain and loss-and then delivers a heart-wrenching twist by placing these alongside an equally splendid moment of beauty and grace. The result is a riveting, utterly engrossing read from first page to last.<br /><br />The Husband's Secret is not a happy story, but hope fills its crevices, right down to the bittersweet end.<br /><br />Note: This novel contains some profanity and sexual content.<br /><br />Thanks to She Reads and Amy Einhorn Books for providing me a free copy to review. All opinions are mine.

0440237688|5.0|The Giver is an amazing novel. It was the first I'd ever read of this genre when I was probably in 4th grade when I got it in a book swap. I ate it up, and it sparked my insatiable appetite for stories like this. The Giver came before Hunger Games, Fahrenheit 451, and even Uglies for me. If you have a young adult or are a young adult, I'd certainly recommend it, even if you've read it before and lost you're copy! Reread, thankfully The Giver is full of nuances, and little bits of info you don't necessarily pick up on the first time. Now for my summary:<br /><br />The Giver is about an 11 year old boy. His name is Jonas. He's grown up in a perfect society, everyone's happy, there is no want or hunger, and everything is decided for you. Making decisions is dangerous of course, so here everything from your food to your spouse is chosen for you by the council. In this world, when you turn 12 you're job is chosen for you! What an exciting time! Jonas is attending his ceremony of twelves when he is assigned to be the next receiver, the one who holds all of the communities memories, whether pleasant or not.<br /><br />To find out how the rest goes, read the book!

B006PFC2S2|4.0|The musicals from the 50s were tops in entertainment and talent.  My daughter has tickets to see it at The Hale Theater, and she asked me what the story was all about.  All I could remember at first was the beautiful dancing by Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly.  A little village hidden by the fog came to mind, and there was some secret about the village.  I remembered the stars fell in love with each other, but I forgot Leslie Caron was in it along with some other popular stars of the 50s.  It was worth the money to go see that show because of all the quality talent presented.  We never got to see that much talent in one movie in the 50s on a Saturday afternoon.  It's a beautiful love story with singing and dancing and certainly worth watching if you like that combination of skills.  I can't help but believe the play being held at The Hale Theater in Salt Lake City will be outstanding, especially since it is in the round.  I loved the movie and may rent it again.
B000FC10MU|4.0|American Gods recently (kind of) passed its ten year anniversary of publication in 2011, prompting a new and revised edition, marketed as the 'Author's Preferred Text.' Gaiman went back to his original manuscript (as he describes in the introduction to this edition) and put some pieces back in that had originally been cut, as well as extended scenes and lengthened dialogue. As with most things (for me), if there is a 'Director's Cut' or an Extended Edition of any sort of media that I am interested in, whether I have experienced the original or not, I'll always choose the longer version. Why wouldn't I want to hear more of the story, or get to see more of the creator's original intended content? This truth made me glad that I had not yet read American Gods, a book I had intended to read for years.<br /><br />Gods is a difficult book to describe, and an even more difficult book to categorize because it simply does not fit into one genre (as Gaiman himself admits, again in the Introduction). Genres certainly serve a purpose, but in literature, we probably want a little variety, hm? And Gods satisfies that want quite well. It is a tiny bit Horror. There's a hearty dash of Fantasy. It has elements of Sci-Fi. And yet all of these poke their heads into what is essentially a roadtrip novel across America, with an initial premise that sounds like it has nothing to do with anything supernatural.<br /><br />It is primarily the story of Shadow, a largely apathetic and unconcerned middle-aged man whom, when we meet him, is about to be released from prison. He is there for murder, which he admits to though the details of the crime are never expanded upon. Upon being released, Shadow rushes for home to be rejoined with his beloved wife Laura. For sake of not spoiling anything, let's just say that plan doesn't work out... and what happens instead isn't pretty.<br /><br />Shadow is approached by a playful and cryptic old man called Wednesday (though it is clearly from an early time that this is not the man's true name) who offers Shadow an equally cryptic job. Newly aimless, Shadow accepts, and it is from there that the two embark on the strangest journey across America you will likely encounter.<br /><br />Between the main narrative are Coming to America segments. These feature a wide array of individuals from all times of history in one-shot stories recounting, in one form or another, their journey to America. These were some of the richest moments in the whole book, as they display Gaiman's appreciation for history and sheer creativity. American Gods could have stood on its own without these short supplements, but their inclusion certainly enhances the whole experience.<br /><br />An odd delight of American Gods is that it is not a novel that tells all of its secrets at once (which is generally a good practice in Fiction anyway). In fact, there is a long period where one can hardly be sure exactly what is happening or why the characters are doing what they are doing. While the narrative is enjoyable all the way through, the story is loose, bizarre, and spans many locations where strange practices are held. It feels in some ways more like a series of snapshots than a strictly straightforward, linear plot. It is not until roughly three-quarters of the way through that Gaiman pulls the threads together in a very satisfying close to the book.<br /><br />I'll be honest in saying there were times when I had trouble sticking with it, precisely for the above-mentioned reason of things feeling a bit disconnected and seemingly included without a clear point. Understand, it does all have a point, it just takes a good while for those reasons to be revealed. There is a chance you'll feel a little lost, mayhap even slightly bored, for certain portions of this book, but know that it is all worth the effort in the end. To put it simply, American Gods is weird, and it is wonderful, and to read it is to set yourself up for a real treat.that this is not the man's true name) who offers Shadow an equally cryptic job.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Is this really THE end--or is it another beginning?  Brandon did Jordan proud.  And in such a style that no one can argue with!
B005LAII3A|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie, constant action and entertainment.<br />I am not the greatest when it comes to being a critic, but I do know what I really enjoy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a really fun game, but it's very addictive. Everyone is saying that there was no update for 7.0, that's probably because Amazon didn't approve it, well now we have  7.5. Also everyone is complaining that updates are slow, it's because they have to have time to fix the bugs, adds stuff to the game, and get it approved, so hop off. It is also a good game if you can't get it for the pc or Xbox. But it is an awesome game and you should get it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I watch a lot of videos online and I was getting annoyed with all of the wires.  Thanks to Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player, I do not have to worry about any more wires!
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Worked great! Does what it has to do give you more memory. Let's see if it holds up for a few years.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would give it ten stars if I could.  I watched all three seasons and can't wait for more.  Well written and the casting is fabulous.  I am so caught up by it.  I gotta say the writers sure know how to make sure some characters can never be happy... I cried my eyes out at season 3 last episode.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|I highly recommend it, worth watching, It is a suspense thriller especially  at the end and won't waste your time.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie, constant action and entertainment.<br />I am not the greatest when it comes to being a critic, but I do know what I really enjoy.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I bought it about three days ago and I haven't stopped playing it. It is so addicting to play and watch the world burn and society crumble just because you infected a country with a bacteria or fungus. Overall great game and haven't stopped playing, not even for sleep, sleeps overrated anyway. Never froze up or got an error message in about three days of playing.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|I loved this book.  The short pages oddly anticipate our byte-size times.<br />Vonnegut's sense of irony is fabulous.  His approach to spirituality walks a wonderful line between pure irony and pure ideal.<br />I just loved this book.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I bought the motion sensing light because our hallway light bulb burned out. So, coming down the steps in the dark, I fell on the last two steps. I hurt myself but it could have been worse. I looked  at Amanzon products and this motion light looked good. We put it on the stairway wall and it works perfectly. It senses when you are going down or up the steps and then shuts off. This is wonderful especially for senior households. I am ordering more. Great Product.
B001EC3JME|3.0|overall its very good it has a strong belt clip and its made fairly well. I use this everyday on duty and it has lost some of its elasticity when i run the flashlight falls out.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Highly unreliable and cheap (in price and quality). Half the time I can't even get on the network. When I do it stalls and heats up like a pan. And did I mention you can't do anything with it except netflix, YouTube, and the useless browser plugin
B00FKE3H0G|4.0|I'm not a Miley fan.  I am slightly embarassed to admit that I found \\"We Can't Stop\\" quite a good driving song. Today I heard the whole album.  I might become a fan of the music...probably still not a fan of the artist.<br /><br />Truth be told, the album is catchy with a great beat and great sing along songs. There are some very in your face songs (give FU a listen) and some songs that are truly emotional (Wrecking Ball, Adore You).<br />All in all, give it a listen but listen with an open mind...you might just find it changed.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|This book was incredible.  I bought it after reading through the song of ice and fire series and upon reading through a short sample.  This is the best sci-fi book I've ever read, and I believe that's due in part to Martin's incredible attention to detail.  I was so engrossed in the universe that Martin creates that I couldn't stop reading. It makes you think, and question your own choices. I can't truly describe the book in all its glorious detail and seeming simplicity. All I can say for sure is I hope Martin returns to this series and continues the impossible story of Havilund Tuf.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|A book full of really unlikable characters who you really don't care what happens to any of them. If you want to know what happens just read the 2nd last chapter.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Ultraviolet instead of an ITunes digital copy.  That makes me pass on buying it.  Quit pushing this Ultraviolet crap on us and sell it with an ITunes compatible digital copy.  DVD sales would go up.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|love, love, love this app.  it's all i use now - on the phone, on the ipad - love it
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Good game. Controls take some getting used to, but really impressive graphics and sound. Picked this up for 99 cents during a special. I would definitely recommend even at the regular price.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I love mysteries, BBC, and David Tennant. This has all three, so of course I adored it :) It is well written and acted. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys GOOD entertainment.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book. First time that I read this author.  Kept me hanging until the end.  Interesting plot.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|pretty good, i bought this book by friend's introducing, was not believe it is interesting, but amazed when started to read
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The book was a page turner but at the quarter end of the book the plot became too obvious and was just a read through.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This show Hooked me in from the first episode...watching it on Amazon prime. would recommend it to anyone, thanks Amazon.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|When purchasing a series of TV shows it is important to have all the years that it was in production.  This year was the beginning year of this show's 7 year production, and therefore a necessity to own if I wanted the entire production.<br /><br />I like the continuity of this series stories, and their interaction within it's 7 year run.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to any serious MacGyver fan, or anyone that appreciates watching mysteries and how the &#34;hero&#34; reasons out the solution to different complex problems.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful, eloquent,and tearful up to the very end.  The book captures you from the beginning and keeps you till the very end.
0192789864|5.0|I confess I didn't love it all that much when I read it in high school, or when I wrote a paper on it in college.  Sure, there were lots of witty lines in it that made me laugh, but there were also too many long, pompous speeches I was ill-equipped to find amusing, and in general too many characters, most of them annoying, starting right out with Mrs. Bennet and the younger daughters.  Elizabeth's sensibilities were mostly lost on me.  But since then I've enjoyed several TV and movie versions of it, including my favorite, the 1980 Masterpiece Theater miniseries (five hours) with the charming Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth and the brilliant Judy Parfitt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Five hours let it really delve into the story, where movies have to cut, cut, cut.  I reread the book at that time, and found that it had improved enormously.<br /><br />Since I was attending a theatrical version of P&P I just decided to reread it, and found it to be a wonderful romance, as deep and rich as one could imagine, as well as an amazingly funny book that pokes fun at people and society.  The long speeches I found so boring are hysterical, and Mrs. Bennet is far more sympathetic.  Having seen Judy Dench's Lady Catherine is to find that character always astonishing.<br /><br />So read this book early and often.  It ages far better than we do.
B000ID3E9S|3.0|CRUEL INTENTIONS. (1999.)  This  98-minute television treatment, an intense  thriller, is based on a historic French novel.  It appears to be a star vehicle for the highly talented young Emmy Award-winning Sarah Michelle Gellar,(BUFFY; VAMPIRE SLAYER) who plays rich and attractive private school student Kathryn Merteuil. She challenges her stepbrother Sebastian Valmont, (who attends the same prep high school, the fictional Manchester School) as played by Ryan Phillippe, (SET UP), to a bet.  The bet involves Annette, (Reese Witherspoon, LEGALLY BLONDE), daughter of the school’s new headmaster. In this unusually star-laden TV treatment, written and directed by Roger Kumble, Selma Blair, A DIRTY SHAME, plays Cecile Caldwell, who will also be a new student at the school: Christine Baranski plays Bunny Caldwell, her mother.  The Oscar-winning Louise Fletcher, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO’S NEST, plays Helen Rosemond, Sebastian’s aunt.  Sean Patrick Thomas plays Ronald Clifford.  Swoosie Kurtz plays Doctor Greenbaum; Tara Reid plays Marci Greenbaum, her daughter.<br /><br />The acting in this teen  drama, which received an R rating, is good, and Gellar carries the picture with a sure touch.  The film also captures the rarified milieu of New York’s super rich, among which it is set.  Cinematography is fine, clothes and interiors are appropriate.  The plot is quick moving, as befits its brief length.  However, the decision to set it in the world of rich teenagers does bend the story line a bit out of shape, and it is given a much softer Hollywood ending than the original on which, like a long list of other films, it is based.  But it isn’t a bad movie.
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|Too long, too academically historical, and too boring for a crime thriller. Beautiful prose- occassionally inspired,  but immature story telling that is strangled by the structure.
1416550550|4.0|It was a good book and I needed to reread it for book club<br />It is just too much work to try to review your products
0061245097|5.0|Night Huntress Book 2 definitely did not disappoint.  It was action packed and gripping.  This series is turning out to be very entertaining.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Would not have expected some of the events that took place! This book was tough to follow in the beginning when we're meeting the characters, but once you start following the story you really just can't stop. I loved it.
1476727651|5.0|This book is definitely a contender for my favorite Stephen King novel. I loved everything about it. I think Abra was a wonderful protagonist character. At one point in the middle of the novel, I almost didn't want to go on, knowing that King can often be quite cruel to his characters (even the \\"good guys\\"). But, no worries. Abra has her share of problems, but isn't mutilated or burned at the stake or anything like that. In fact, King left it wide open for Abra to return in another novel.<br /><br />There are a couple of nice surprises along the way that I didn't see coming at all. Great story overall. Compared to his other works, I'd say King stuck to the story line a bit more with this one. There isn't as much elaborate description of every detail as in most of his works (which is nice because it keeps it under 1000 pages!). The story is also a great continuation of Danny from The Shining. But I thought Abra was definitely the star of the show. Ya gotta love her!<br /><br />One thing I could say that I would like to have seen is Rose being a bit more \\"colorful\\" in character. King didn't get that really, really sarcastic tone going as he does with a lot of his \\"bad guys.\\" That said, more humor out of her would have been good, but she worked in the story line just fine. He did make it clear that she was drop-dead gorgeous. Kind of makes it interesting for an antagonist...<br /><br />I also liked the tie-in at the end to some of the \\"ghostie people\\" (great party, isn't it?) from the Overlook Hotel. The final showdown is on the grounds where the Overlook once stood.<br /><br />Anyway, wonderful book for King... as always! This would make a great movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Like it it's cool I love hunger games it looks good and people say so, so I think it looks good
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Wonderful story line!<br /><br />Cast is great, just a mix of actual comedians, serious drama.<br />Each episode is long enough to entertain.<br />Plot is good.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|If you go and see Percy Jackson without reading the books, you'll love it because you'll think it is an amazing movie. If you have read the books, you are left with two options: Either don't see the movie, or go in to the movie expecting it to be vastly different from the book, because that is exactly what it is. As a stand alone movie, it is amazing. However, if you are looking for a movie that is based on the book, you'll be sorely disappointed, as it turns away from the book countless times throughout the movie.
B001SF8G1Q|4.0|New Morning is the best album effort of Dylan's \\"lost years\\", post John Wesley Harding and pre-Blood On The tracks.  This remastered version has a full bodied and crisp sound and gives the rhythm section its full due.  $7.98 for the amazon prime is a terrific price.<br />With more piano than usual, it sounds like Bob is in his parlor ruminating effortlessly on things both domestic and spiritual; light hearted, metaphoric, wry, casual.<br />The artist inaugurates his new open throated voice while exploring life from a variety of angles during his family years in Woodstock. After the choked croon of Nashville Skyline and the half hearted loose pitch of Self Portrait it's a unique voice in his ouvre and captures a week or so in his recording life; hoarse, perhaps with a cold or with a smokers throat, but full out.<br />Sign On The Window is its masterpiece, showcasing Bob's full vocal range on a lyric content both cryptic and mundane, with references to signs, rain, and rural bliss.  Also included are the pure pop of If Not For You, New Morning, and Winterlude, the personal in Man In Me, Father of Night, and the narrative of Day Of The Locusts, Went To See The Gypsy.  Some of the cuts were apparently written and slated for an aborted theater project but one would be hard-pressed to know which ones, there is a consistency in the sound that feels as if the album is birthed from one state of mind.<br />New Morning is a solid effort in the Dylan canon with great sound, Dylan singing well and upbeat, even fun at times.  Perhaps the least angst ridden of all (even lacking of the melancholy of some of Nashville Skyline) it is nonetheless a strong group of Dylan originals.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Not a fan of movies where the characters are so annoying and unlikeable that  no amount of special effects can make it a hood movie. Blah.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors.  He never disappoints me!  The action is fast and exciting.  I love it.
B00B2166BS|5.0|The (current) Nexus 10.1 has one micro USB port.  This is used primarily for charging.  The Pogo Cable allows the micro USB to be used instead for importing information, images, and so on.<br />The Pogo Cable is as advertised.  It does recharge the tablet quicker than charging through the USB port. The magnetic lock does prevent damage to the recharging cable, or tablet if the cable is pulled in some way.  The lock is firm, and very easy to connect.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Excellent movie. Recommend to anyone in the military especially in the Pacific region. Marines and Navy will be excited about this movie.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I can't remember the last time I sat down to read a book and finished it in less than two days. This is, and I'm ashamed to say it, my first time reading Sanderson's work, but what a great way to begin! Steelheart was an incredible story filled with memorable characters, intense action, and descriptive scenery. There wasn't one character I liked more than the others, all of them were fantastic. David was a great protagonist and narrator. His determination was balanced perfectly with his awkwardness. The direction that Sanderson took with the idea of super powers was very unique in my opinion. Even though super powers are myth and exist only in entertainment, we always assume there are good guys to fight off the bad guys. What if it didn't work like that though? What if power corrupted even the most gentle of souls?<br /><br />This was an amazing book, and I jumped in excitement when I learned there would be a sequel next year. The only bad thing is having to wait for it!
B004EPYZT4|4.0|I bought this movie for my dads bday and he loved it. No issues with it, it just wasn't there as soon as I would have liked. But all around a good product.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Excellent. I have always been a big fan of Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. Love having it on my Kindle. Makes verification of words and their meanings quite convenient.

B00FAIPDAE|3.0|Generic game play really. You build your village from nothing and earn extra resources by playing against people online or beating campaign missions. Not that challenging but it's really, really tedious and it can get boring rather quickly. Worth checking out but not something you will play long term.

I have tried others like this and was disappointed with the way they played....blocks VERY small.....different colors...really hard to use, even with a stylus.<br />I am happy to report that THIS app plays great whether with a stylus or with your fingertip!<br />Levels get progressively more difficult, but still doable.....with a few restarts along the way....<br />I think I would have paid for this app had it not been free at the time!
B0027MJU00|2.0|I really liked Gone Girl and picked this book as I was on a roll.  The story and characters were so abysmal, as was the setting.  I think we all know that this scenario exists, and I was so depressed after reading it that I have not read another novel since!  I will not give up on the author as she is a good writer.  I just need time to heal.

B000FC272M|4.0|Travels with a donkey is a well written beautiful story of an actual journey taken by RLS in France to recover from a broken romance.  Mosestine, the donkey, started off slowly and with poor equipment which was improved by and there was some doubt that they were ever to reach their destination.  Also included is the kindness of strangers, met along the way.  I enjoyed reading this little book.  As it was the Kindle Edition I felt that it may not be the whole story but even so, enough to give light reading.  Modestine does improve as she wanders along the tracks of the Cervennes and eventually they do learn to adapt to each other's ways with advantage to both. .
B00DQVKGOU|3.0|My husband enjoyed this book, and now he knows a little more that is going on in Elementary (the TV show).
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I purchased this DVD for a friend. I rented it from Netflix and absolutely loved it.  It gave me a new perspective on the history of the United States even though it's not a &#34;documentary&#34;.  Highly recommended!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Have your tissues ready! This is a great movie, but has it's moments which I cannot say anymore or I may ruin it for someone who wants to watch it. It's worth the money and it's based on a true story. Dog lovers will really like this one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series. The acting is top rate, and the portrayal of life in England and after WW2 is amazing

B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I've used the case now for over a month, and it's excellent! I have dropped my phone (as I always do) no less than 10 times now on surfaces such as tile and wood flooring and there's barely a scratch on the case.  The phone is very well protected, and I'm sure this case will last a long time. I will probably order a few different colors so I can change it up once in a while, but the blue is a good color.  It is a little lighter than the picture shows, but still a good shade of blue.<br /><br />The one thing I dislike about the case, which isn't really the case at all, is the little jelly bean buttons that it came with. I want to like them, but if you lay the phone face down on any hard surface the button sticks out further than the case and then Siri wakes up and asks you what you want.  I want to keep the button on, but if I do, I'll have to turn off Siri...  IF the button were just a little bit thinner, it would be perfect.  But, again, this has no impact on the case as these buttons were a 'bonus', so the case still gets a 5 star rating. :-)<br /><br />-Tim
1439156816|5.0|This book really explained so much about what the author had been through in his life and Stephen King inspired me to pick up my first work from the past and edit it taking out all of the stuff that people would skip when reading. I have now published 'Janus the Arrival' thanks to this great master whose 'On Writing' is a must for any author. Fantastic and written with real honesty.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Could not love this cd more, great music as always and great songs. This is a great cd and would make a great gift. Packaged well and arrived when expected.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This is going to be a short review but this is Korn getting back to what they do best.  I've been listening to this album non-stop for the past few days and it's easily their best album in the past 10 years.  If you're a Korn fan, don't miss it and make sure to give it a few listens.  \\"Never Never\\" being the single is deceiving - it's likely the worst song on the album.

And I'm frustrated with it, especially when my friends need to Kik me. Please get the app up and running correctly again like it use to ! Thanks ! :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the best Science Fiction TV show since Star Trek.  How sad that the executives at FOX were so myopic.  I hope that they are kicking themselves silly over this egregious error to cancel such a superlative series.
6304602944|4.0|This is one of my husband's favorite classics. It's a good movie, and we've enjoyed watching it. No complaints with the seller.

B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Not a big Tom Cruise fan, but this movie was ok. They just don't make very many good movies anymore.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|I loved the story line .. but the writing is clumsy and amateurish . I kept trying to read it because I really wanted to know who the murderer was. It was just so bad that I couldn't waste another second. There are far too many good books to waste time on a bad one
B00FJTYDKK|2.0|Definitely not worth more than 1.00.  The story was boring, the characters were weird and out of place and many were just there for show.  The jokes were old.  Most have been used in DreamWorks films so many times that they are getting boring.  Don't rent it for 3.99, find a cheaper place and DEFINITELY DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the entire trilogy in a week. That should tell you just how great this book is. It will have you looking at things in a whole new way. Great job E L James!!

B00D8HNR2K|1.0|:( the lyrics are simple,  someone else is pulling Trent's strings. He has more talent  than this.  It was sad to say the least.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|A hopeful book, that reminds us of what we all innately know. Light reading, does not require any thought, and provides guidelines for a more positive outlook on life

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|i love how the media made such a big deal about guest appearances.  if you know queens, you know that guests end up sounding like the band and rarely stand out. great album, wonderful return.
B00933JL0A|5.0|This game is sooo fun!! You can build all of these different little shops it is so cute and time killing!
B005IFSSK6|4.0|This book is a beautiful love story, that makes me jealous. If the whole werewolf part makes you uncertain, then don't! Totally read it for the characters, and love story.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun and addictive but it is so hard to get tokens yet it costs so much to complete missions such as revive or multiplier.  I ended up uninstalling because it is too easy to accidentally spend tokens.  There should be an option to use tokens or bananas to complete missions which would also correct the problem with inadvertently spending tokens.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Good good good great movie! This movie has everything! Amazing graphics! Most of all amazing storyline! Highly recommended! Watch it!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book has a very detailed description and it was glorious I am buying the series immediately. Anybody would love this book.
0486282112|4.0|What responsibilities does a creator have toward his creation? What is it that separates man from animal? What human experiences does everyone deserve?<br /><br />These are just some of the questions posed in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, \\"Frankenstein\\", the plot of which resulted as a challenge to write a ghost story while on vacation with Lord Byron. The story revolves around a scientist, Victor Frankenstein, who has created a \\"modern Prometheus\\" - an artificial man. However, his invention is so ghastly that he is immediately turned off by it.<br /><br />However, the monster he has created is disappointed in Frankenstein. He travels through central Europe, looking for a way to learn about the world around him and experience what it means to be human. Unfortunately, the reactions of man after man prevent him from ever fully integrating into the human race, resulting in a rage at his creator that wreaks havoc and destruction, not only on Frankenstein himself, but also on those he holds dear.<br /><br />This is not a horror story in the vein that we are used to. It's more a story of consequences, what it means to be human, and what we as individuals owe each other. Told in a series of \\"remembrances\\" enshrined in letters (as was a common method of storytelling in the nineteenth century), it is both the tale of the mad scientist and his creation.<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those books that everyone has heard of and few people have actually read. For those of you who are wondering whether or not to pick up the novel, please do so. It's worth the read!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This certainly is going to be in the top 5 of my most influential books.  Rarely does a book of this length keep me interested and I end up skimming through parts... But I didn't skim a word of this and thought the whole entire thing was a serious page turner.  I also like the study guide that's online.  So what did I really like?  The fact that Lin never gave up, no matter how bad it got, to start with.  I loved Khader's philosophy, and Karla's sayings.  The culture of India, and Lin's observations.  Lin's reasoning and survival..  how the black market works..  Lin traveling through the mountains and what a grueling journey that was!  I read this with Google Earth close by, to see where all the places were.  I'm thinking about this book now, a month after I read it.  What an epic novel this is!  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants a reading experience that will sure stay with them!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|By far one of the best novels I've ever read. The characters are just the right amount of complex without boring you to death with unnecessary details. I love that I had trouble predicting what would happen. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys constant suspense!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I think 3 1/2 stars might be more accurate.  Piper Kerman is a capable writer but I really decided to read this because I'm watching the Netflix series.<br /><br />Which is TERRIFIC...and Ms. Kerman is a technical consultant on the show.<br /><br />So, the book was a good and very interesting read and it can't quite stand up next to the over the top antics of the fabulous characters and actors in the series.<br /><br />It probably is not even fair to compare them, but in my case it was inevitable because I found the book through the series.<br /><br />In summary, good book, amazing series.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This a book that everyone interested in their health should read. An easy way to improve our lives. Something for every family.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|A quick and easy read - I totally relate to the content, principles and exercises. This is the book that I wish I had written. I bought many copies to give away.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|I spent one minute trying to find help - no luck. How am I supposed to guess the rules and objective of the game?
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a great app. Its great all around and has wonderful options for customizing alarms.  The only issue I have  had is that it occasionally stops responding and prevents my kindle's time from updating.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it. Free movies, pics, videos, and music. Paired with my mohu leaf ultimate, I get high def, high quality programming without the high monthly bills from cable or satellite. My only complaints:<br />Doesn't support amazon instant video (yet). Hope they do soon.<br />Doesn't play well with HDMI switches. I bought a 3 in HDMI pigtail switch. It works fine with my roku2, games, etc. But it gets no signal when I plug the chromecast into it. Its a known issue though and as my rating says, it doesn't detract from the device enough to matter.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|I had an oooooold atkins book from my aunt and I bought this to compare. This is not as strict but the idea is the same 20 carbs a day. I always have faster weight loss on the Atkins 1972 version (25lbs). If you're serious about knocking of the pounds I'd start there then consider net carbs. I just personally don't believe knocking off carb counts using net carbs will help people, especially considering that the FDA allows companies to knock of calories and carb counts due to fiber before we total it.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|The wave scenes are magnificent; however, the lessons that Frosty teaches Jay as well as their relationship and what Frosty gained through mentoring Jay are lessons that benefit each and every viewer open to learn.
1401242855|4.0|Although I ordered this because it was listed as a HC and not TPB (which is what it is) nor came with a stand for the mask (as shown) I still love this story.  This story is amazing.  And don't get me started on Capullo's art which i have loved since X-Force.<br /><br />I would say pick this up for those wanting to read a great story that leads into an even better story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|All I can say is wow. Such a wonderful story about first love and heartache. As an avid reader I have overlooked this book title more then once, but it was recommended by someone who has never steered me wrong. I'm so glad it's now in my forever Kindle library. A must read, just make sure you keep the tissues handy.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|While the author says in the very early pages he isn't able to supply actual historical facts of Jesus he does offer information that the reader can transfer if they have an open mind.  As with any religious topic the reader must be able to consider the data under the light in which it is presented.  If your convictions are hard set you may be wasting your time reading this book.
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely love this entire series. I am so excited that there is a movie coming out and I dont care how long I have to stand in a line to get tickets on opening night... I WILL BE THERE WITH BELLS ON!!! This was a beautiful love story and I love that someone was finally courageous enough to talk about some of the things that happen behind closed doors in many relationships throughout the world. I believe we all have some nasty in us but not all of us are brave enough to talk about it. I relate to this story in so many different ways, I just never knew exactly how to go about talking about it, or put action into it. Thank you for opening other doors in my personal life, it just keeps getting better. I strongly hope that this series continues.
B00DJZ06DO|5.0|DVD arrived as was described and is of high quality. Movie played perfectly fine and no glitches were experienced during playback.

B00594XOZU|1.0|This app worked for months and I deleted it a couple of times.But the Day I really need it. It won't let me log in. I was very disappointed because it use to work, now it won't let me log in I beg u strongly to fix this. I need this app! It's my only way to communicate with my friends and some family and I'm 13yrs old my friends and family are important to me right now I really need this app please fix..!!! Like seriously.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game but as someone else mentioned, I also wished there was an easier way to get diamonds.and there are so many levels,which is good in a way cause u get to play long, but so much is required to move from early
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I'm amazed that brad Pitt would star in this movie.  It was boring and repetitive. Almost dumb!  Original Night of the Living Dead beats it all over.  Really disappointed.
B008Y6OJGI|5.0|EXCELLENT! Well worth it to purchase this movie to watch again with friends on movie night. Plenty of Intrigue, action!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I use this product often for accessing my computer at home to do things mobile devices are not able to do well.  I find it most useful when I'm on trips and need photos I've taken edited in batch.  I'll upload it to online storage, Splashtop to my home computer, then download/edit the photos on my home computer.  I'm talking hundreds of photos so doing it on a tablet with even the most appropriate app available would take rediculously long.<br /><br />I love my Splashtop HD!
B005V20JKI|1.0|This game was my favorite: beautiful graphics, smooth and enjoyable gameplay, and fun multiplayer!<br />---<br />That was until the update rolled out<br />* A level cap at 20<br />* In App Purchases to gain points, and to progress into the game, and upgrade characters<br />---<br />These new features have destroyed the fun in the game. Listen to your customers and fix this! Bring back the Muffin Knight we loved!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Unlimited skips, ban artists or just a song, create a custom station by combining stations from a plethora of choices and only the occasional &quot;this is AccuRadio&quot; blurt...leave Pandora behind. This is the one app you need for your musical soul.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|it keeps you gripped the whole time. no boring moments. great continuity! just an overall fantastic book. keep it up!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story line. Love the actors and love the speed at which the action happens. Its not long and drawn out. The suspense of what will happen next has kept me watching. At the end of each episode I don't want it to end...
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song is a fantastic collection of songs from the very strong singer/songwriter Amos Lee. MOSROS represents a fine continuation of the pattern Lee set with Mission Bell -- excellent songwriting with deep, passionate lyrics and catchy tunes and very interesting guest appearances that really add to Amos' voice (and music) but don't overpower it. In particular, Patty Griffin is a terrific complement to Amos Lee and I'd love to see him do more songs with Griffin in the future. Recording with his touring band seems to achieve an instant \\"unity\\" to the Album that is noticeable.<br /><br />I first heard Amos Lee as the opening act at a Dave Matthews Band concert and was immediately impressed with his voice -- only to learn that his songwriting was equally outstanding. When you hear critics refer to certain songwriters as \\"craftsmen\\" you can think that the term is overwrought but it would seem appropriate to call Amos Lee a \\"craftsman\\" songwriter in a simple, straightforward way since he produces such \\"easy\\" quality.<br /><br />So I would recommend ANY Amos Lee album as a good purchase but MOSROS represents a very brilliant effort, perhaps his strongest to date.  My favorite songs (on first listen) are Chill in the Air, Dresser Drawer, The Man Who Wants You, and the title song \\"Mountains of Sorrow\\" but all the songs are strong showings. It's a very mature album and hopefully promises much more to come in the future from this very talented musician.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I actually felt kind of silly buying this album.  I've got to tell you, it was worth it.  This chick can sing!  She's got some very catchy lyrics and full of emotion and fun.<br /><br />I love all the music and it kept me interested without fast forwarding through it.<br /><br />Buy it! You'll like it!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This group is a full package- melodies and lyrics are amazing.  A few surprises in there too.  I was pleasantly surprised that I can play the entire CD without wanting to skip through any songs (very rare for me.)
1455526959|4.0|Michael Connelly books are always well written and interesting. Connelly usually develops his characters in a very believable manner as well as developing a very good plot line. Good escapism!!!!!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Please fix this app  I love this app and I really need it to work again it's hasn't worked for awhile
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was the best free calculator app I found and I reviewed a lot of apps!  This calculator is very easy to use!!

B005QI4TP8|5.0|The music is complicated, intense and captivating.  It is the kind of thing that you listen to at night though.  Florence+Machine is quite the compelling artist.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Another Reacher page-turner. Lee Child kept me guessing into the final pages.<br /><br />Reacher is likable as ever, as is his squeeze-du-jour.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is a perfect combo of subway surfers and temple run 1and 2 keep up the good work
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|From the first song and the first listening this album had me connected.  Real heart, real story telling, real Rod Stewart.  It has been awhile, but it was worth the wait.
B00001ODGR|5.0|This is such a great concert! I have been lucky enough to have seen them several times over the years! I love & miss Dennis DeYoung as the lead man! This concert does not disappoint! Delivered by date promised. Thank you!
0385523394|4.0|We selected this for our book club, and it yielded really great discussion! I used to think the prison was just a punishment (a loss of time of your life) and then you go back to what you have before. I now realize the system fails our community if it continues this way. Not everyone has something to go back to, like Piper, and some sort of reform really should be happening. Instead of a punishment it should be more like a reform (especially for those non-violent offenders). Ahhh though honestly, non-violent offenders should not be serving the same or longer sentences as violent offenders. Fines and community service would better suit the community and honestly THAT should be the focus when crimes take place. How can society benefit? What can we do to create better citizens?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i am completely hooked and cant wait til next season. I was sad to see two of the main characters killed off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very . Entertaining. I play it with my boy toy and I always kick his but. My high score now is over 165000 and he thinks he gonna beat it but he is seeking. I wuv my Patrick very very very much.
B0070XFNDE|3.0|Shadow of the Wind is a fabulous book. This is a sequel but it is rather thin and doesn't have the same heft and magic.
B0000667RO|5.0|I was looking for Bryan Adams songs I already loved. Love, love, love this CD. Love every song on this CD! Listen to it often. Delivered before date given. Thank you!
B00FEN000S|2.0|The movie is poorly cast. Don't get me wrong, charlie hunnam, you're hot. Buuuuuuut.......you're not good in this movie. Save yourself some $$$ and rent it off red box for $1.00 when it comes out. It wasn't horrible. It just wasn't worth the $20 we spent here on amazon.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I appreciate the author's brilliance and strength in living her life, and her courage in writing about it.  I read this book many nights at 2 a.m. as a salve for sleeplessness, and found incredible comfort in Sandberg's work.  Overachieving women, take heart: you are not alone.  This book was like a hug for me --- one I didn't want (I can do it all myself, thank you very much); one I didn't seek out (yuck, another best seller from this genre?); and one that surprised no one more than me (so. . . I was reading this book called &#34;Lean in,&#34; and...). But in the end, I surrendered to it, and was strengthened by Sandberg reaching out.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really like the game. It's fun, and It gives me a good challenge that I haven't had in a long time. I give it 5 Stars.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|I honestly thought that with 186 reviews and an overall 4 1/2 star rating, this book was a great find. Although I am not a stickler for perfect grammar, the writing was horrendous! I completely agree with other reviews that the author must be in middle school! On a single page, the author first refers to a character as \\"Detective Max Larkin,\\" then as \\"Max,\\" then as \\"I\\", changing from the third person to the first person and then back again. Thank goodness I only spent $.99 on this and because it was blatantly obvious from very early in the book who committed the murders, I can avoid wasting any more of my time finishing the book.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I read Outview a few months back and enjoyed it very much. I thought it particularly suited to a young adult audience, but as is the case with other well-written books and series for that audience, it works great with us more mature folks too! The subject matter to me is quite reminiscent of Carlos Castenada's books of alternate realities, but also touches on many other streams of mysticism and expanded consciousness - yet it's all written in a very fast-moving and entertaining manner that definitely keeps you engaged - it's a fun ride!<br /><br />The main characters are very much locked in an \\"us guys against the world\\" sort of on-going battle, with the shadowy government and/or corporate operatives being the bad guys, all of which is unfortunately all too believable these days. And there are a number of \\"there's help if you're open to it\\" times too to keep things from getting totally hopeless, and lots of instances of our good guys and gals having to grow and open more and more to keep up with the help offered. Sort of like life!<br /><br />I'm writing this while I'm getting ready to order the next installment, so you know I liked it.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Fascinating to read about the symbology of our nation's capital and how wise our Founding Fathers were. It's a good story, well researched.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Clever story great actors! I was skeptical at first but got sucked in from the first episode. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|It was a good love movie, but it didn't keep me entertained the whole time. I think it was missing something.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game to play with family and friends or alone. Also an awesome way to relax after a stressful day of work out school. I love this game!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Everytime John Mayer releases a new album, I always get a little bit nervous.  As far as I'm concerned, every studio release of his has been great and I'm always worried he might drop the ball...everyone does from time to time.  A lot of Mayer fans continue to clamor for a &#34;Continuum Part 2,&#34; so if you are expecting something along those lines, you might be disappointed. However, Paradise Valley exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Artists should grow, mature, and continually evolve their music.  If every successful artist released an album nearly identical to the sound that made them popular, we'd have a lot of music that didn't push boundaries or try anything new.  I think that Mayer started this evolution with Battle Studies, kept moving forward with Born and Raised, and now Paradise Valley is the culmination of those new sounds.<br /><br />Out of eleven tracks, there are only a couple I could do without.  &#34;Wildfire&#34; (the 2nd one) is sung entirely by Frank Ocean.  Not that Ocean isn't a good vocalist, but this is a John Mayer album.  When an artist releases an album once every couple years, you feel a little disappointed when one of the songs features someone else completely.  The two VERY country tracks, &#34;You're No One 'Til Someone Lets You Down&#34; and &#34;Badge And Gun&#34; made me do a double take when I first heard them.  They are unlike anything John has recorded before and although I wasn't a fan at first, after a few listens they grew on me.<br /><br />In summary, John Mayer is one of the best guitarists of the current generation, and while his style continues to evolve, you can hear that creating quality music is still his primary goal.  If you are expecting a copycat album of some of his older works, you might be disappointed, but if you listen to Paradise Valley with an open mind, you'll find some pretty great music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just buy all three books - I didn't know if I would like them, so I bought them one at a time. I was hooked after the 1st book. What a great writer!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books! They are thrilling and sexual at the same time. Fell in love with the main character!
0385743564|5.0|I thought this was a great book. While the pacing felt more like a movie than a book, i really enjoyed it. It looks like there will be another book inthe series and i am looking forward to it. Im constantly amazed and the quantity and quality of the books brandon puts out. He has never dissapointed me. Pardon my typos... im writing this on a tablet.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|I own everything there is to own regarding anything TWILIGHT!! ♥  So I cannot wait to get my hands on this so I can view it w/my sisters who are also fans of the series, but I take the cake!!

B00DQVSTCG|3.0|I like the video, but I think that in some areas of the video it needed some editing or the sound was just off.  The concert was so awesome the video just does not live up to the real thing.  Nothing like seeing Madonaa LIVE IN CONCERT!!!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince & Paul do a great job, but no one does it any better than the Hag & Buck themselves!
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|It was ok. I didn't like the fact that they were ending it. And to end it like that was no good to me. They gave him PTSD over the New York thing in the avengers. They could've just made another iron man movie they didn't have to link the avenger movie in to it. Iron man didn't even save the day pepper did. I think who ever wrote it should give it up.
B00AEFY0F2|3.0|I ordered this movie and I was really looking forward to it and it came in the mail right on time. when I began to watch the movie, the sound quality was not real good. I had to turn my T V up and it started to buzz. The picture was great and the disc looked fine.

B00594XOZU|1.0|Recently acquired my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with which I downloaded the recent update. I had been using the previous version with my account already signed in on my former Kindle therefore I hadn't noticed that Kik login doesn't work until now. Please fix this.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app.  It's so simple.  I no longer write notes in a paper notebook that I have to hunt down.  I keep everything right on my kindle.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It's good when a book grabs you by the tenth page. This one took a while, as the beginning was quite chaotic, characters being introduced one by one in a very fast succession. At first there was no connection among them, but then it was obvious that they will meet at one point or another. Good news is that it was a quick read and ended too fast. Unfortunately some secrets were not revealed by the end of the book.<br />It is about the skeletons in every bodies closets and about what would happen when those skeletons come out. The idea - ignorance is bliss actually is so true, because there are truth that would change how we see people around us, even our beloved ones. The book ended leaving a feeling that I want more, but on the other hand it is not a book I will return to very often.

0385351399|5.0|THE CIRCLE, Dave Eggers's latest novel, begins with Mae Holland's first day on the job at a company eerily similar to Facebook or Google. Taking into consideration the luxuries offered to her, as well as worldwide influence of the company, Mae believes herself to have found \\"heaven\\". The reader witnesses Mae losing her personalized life in favor of \\"transparency\\". Similar to the behavior of the hogs in Orwell's ANIMAL FARM, corporate rules are posted, being enforced by the ravenous HR `dogs' sent out to correct anyone not abiding. Mae, under the watch of \\"The Circle\\" must send out her status updates, called zings, and monitor results using nine computer monitors. Mercer, her ex-boyfriend, is the added voice of reason; her parents are the added example of what happens to those living outside of The Circle's influence.<br /><br />Eggers's deft prose can best be described as light and agile. Some readers may feel the characters in THE CIRCLE are a bit shallow or flat--perhaps even clich&eacute;d. However, I believe Eggers made an intentional choice in this regard, which allowed the character of the company, The Circle, to take center stage as the dominant personality and antagonist of this book.<br /><br />While THE CIRCLE is not a book of the horror genre, it is a scary book. Happenings in this book are on par with such real life examples as: Facebook opening a $120 million housing project, iPhones unlocked via your fingerprint, and Google launching computer-enabled camera glasses. Perhaps people will get angry at the issues Eggers brings about, but this is a conversation that needs to happen, making THE CIRCLE a deserving read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Almost like cityville. This game is cool. You can build your own city and make your people happy. It is a five star game!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Crippling story I couldn't put this book down. The question asked as I was reading is she getting away with the crime
B000M341QE|5.0|We wanted to see the movie with English-sub titles -- our favorite way to really grasp all of the words and content.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Every page held your interest... a very good read. Each character a story in itself. And the &#34;secret&#34; was unexpected to say the least!
B007VTUYWW|5.0|Love being able to choose from a huge list of movies, FREE, with my Prime account! Makes watching movies fun and easy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is a ton of fun. But the ads that pop up several times in a game are very annoying. Would like a way to opt out.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|KISS has been my favorite band since about the time they started rolling out records.  I ordered the cd here for my brothers birthday (I already had it) as he is a KISS fan like myself.  I'd recommend this cd to anyone that likes to rock n roll!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It was sort of a slow read at first, but eventually I became attached to Pat and had to find out the ending.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|The book was exciting from the first chapter. It is the First Reacher novel I have read but I did not feel like I missed any thing from previous novels it was a quick and thrilling adventure novel.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Good graphics, good interface, fun gameplay. The talisman mechanics add a lot of interesting choices for how you wish to play.
B002JI94J4|5.0|It was wonderful.  My father was very excited and happy he received them. I was very pleased with the prompted service I received.

B00F2362IE|5.0|My 5 year old son and my husband both love playing this game together. I purchased this for my son as a reward for doing good I'm kindergarten. Good incentive!
0770437400|3.0|This was not what I had expected since I do not read war novels I do not have anything to rate it by.  I think the book is simply weighed down by too much military lingo and the like.  I did not realize 'WWZ' was military-industrial complex propaganda.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so musch. It fun for the roads and when ur sick. Lol . You should Purchase this ideam!!!! &lt;3
B001BANK32|5.0|This is easily my favorite book by Stephen King. Love the setting. Love the characters. Love it all. This is the second time I've read it and it was just as good, intense and entertaining as it was 20-years ago when I first read it. What was Stanley Kubrick thinking when he destroyed this in the movies???
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Stupid, disgusting and vulgar. Need I say more? This is why we have a populace that has been dumbed down and desensitized by the garbage spewing out of that cess pool known as Hollywood.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Circle exists as the dream company, strongly. Evoking the real life image of Google and its ecstatic campus.  Here is the job envisioned by every striving college graduate ready to start life with a slavery equivalence of tuition debt.  The best that many of the bright and shining can wish for is an unlovely cubicle at the power company with good benefits.  The Circle provides every hip and/or esoteric interest to every employee.  The campus is lovely.  Management is accessible and each employee is valued.  In fact each new hire is given their own high technology tablet and phone.  Al the old data is loaded on to the monogrammed new tech, and the old units are whisked off for recycling...<br /><br />Mae is our well know entitlement member of the underemployed college graduates.  Her past is unsurprising and is filled with supportive parents and comfortable home.  Her best friend Annie, has been her constant presence and has just gotten Mae a job with her, at Circle.  From the nearly \\"Brave New World\\" midsummer party well oiled with higher alcohol drinks to the ubiquitous white boards spouting the happy slogans of \\"1984\\", the foreshadowing here is without subtlety.  Something ominous this way comes.<br /><br />How you view this novel depends on your views of transparency versus privacy.  I am reviewing this book on the digital giant.  My life is readily viewable, but I relinquish a lot of privacy for the convenience of driving directions in real time and linked pay options.  Still, my camera knowing where I took every question makes me a bit queasy.  These are the questions raised in this interesting novel.  I just find the plot development, well transparent even with the twists and reverses that comprise the story line.  Mae just is not that interesting to me., and as I already noted noted, within ten pages, two classic dystopian images are presented.  The book is fun to read with plenty of \\"tech porn\\" as new gadgets and ideas are rolled out.  If nothing else it begs the question how much privacy are we willing to cede to convenience and safety?s the question how much privacy are we willing to cede to convenience and safety?
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wow, I was hooked from the first episode. Great plot kept me on the edge of my seat. Claire Danes is superb in this role.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|this game is a wonderful gift for my granddaughters who live entertaining playing while in school are not very nice
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My son loves this jumperoo.  At 3 months, he had a hard time reaching the ground, but we placed the lid to a paper carton underneath and he finds great joy in bouncing to create light and sound.  It won't be long before we can remove this and he can bounce on the floor.  As he grows there are two additional settings to adjust to for his height (3 total).  Assembly was fast and easy.  I do find that the base is a little flimsy when moving around the room, but it doesn't seem to affect the function of the product, so I did not grade negatively for this.  I have found that my son now prefers to be in an upright position and we are able to use reclined toys like swings and bouncers less.  This gives him the support he needs while he is working on sitting upright on his own.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A well- written touching story, based on historical events, will stay with you. Interwoven characters are realistically described as they interact throughout the book.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Just when you thought it couldn't get any better!  Another melt-your-face masterpiece from one of the few bands that can pull this off with every expectation blown away!  I can't think of anyone since the mighty Zep who can continue to top themselves every time...... thanks guys for continuing to make albums/music that keep fans in mind as they create and present more gifts for the diehard rock audience!  I look forward to wearing this new collection out in the next few weeks and future!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|After trying everything else. this product did exactly what I needed to clean up my Kindle Fire so I could download
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Wonderful! My children loved the splashes of 3D rain and bubbles. Another winner from the always solid Walt Disney Co.

B00F91SCXC|5.0|Can a soldier find the medical cause for a zombie apocalypse while medical professionals are stumped? Of course! He's Brad Pitt for goodness sake. This is one of the best zombie movies. High action and even made me jump when I didn't see a scene coming which means it had some originality.

B009PMEEY2|5.0|Although it only took a day or two to finish the adventure,  it was fun. Haven't tried survival mode yet.
B00DH4BL4U|4.0|I got this book about 12 hours ago and read and finished it in about 8 hours to the exclusion of everything else. Yes it's an interesting, compelling inside-view on the business of modern football and what it takes to be an outlier that makes it in that world.<br /><br />Unlike many reviewers of the book so far, I can't claim to be a Zlatan über-fan. Obviously I know well who he is being a huge fan of European football and I also know well about the drama and controversy that surrounds him. However, I chose this book because of all the hype about all the excerpts that have been re-emerging with the recent publication of this English translation (vs the sensational excerpt translations we got a couple of years ago when the book first came out). I got this book wanting an inside view of Z's Barca years as well as his controversial behavior throughout the years.<br /><br />What I can say is that he is who he is. Il ne regrette rien, as they say. His attitude to past misdeeds is more &#34;yeah I could have handled that better but it's not that big a deal.&#34; As for rules, nice guys who play by the book are forgotten. In any case, like him or loathe him, you have to admire his self-belief in pulling himself up from his circumstances and believing in himself through many of his self-inflicted conflicts with authority. This book also provided a good exposé about the characters of people behind the scenes in the clubs he's played in and against as well as how dirty and underhanded the business of football is.<br /><br />This book is interesting and fast-paced with a narrative style that is easy and fun to read even when he's reliving football matches. Have no fear of disappointment because this also happens to read like a Disney sports movie where every difficult and controversial season is capped with a trophy. But this is the fact of this great legend's life. He's told his story unapologetically in a way that is only to be expected from Zlatan.
0786838655|5.0|Our library doesn't have many copies available and there is a long waiting list.  So I bought this for my son.  Great book for a young boy!  My son loves it.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|Very Very hard to work, needs info on how to work!! Not user friendly. Don't recommend. needs to be simple.
0132350882|5.0|A perspective employer told me to read this book if I wanted to learn a lot about writing code. He was right.<br /><br />This book is general to the sense that it can teach to anyone programming in any language. My peers and I have noticed a tremendous improvement in the readability of code after going through this book. Even if you are experienced and feel like you know what you are doing, there are a lot of lessons you can learn through this book. It is a quick read and well worth your time.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Loved the book, l liked the movie.  There was only so much they could fit in two hours but it was enjoyable.  I would watch it again.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Real looking toys , good quality plastic, never breaks even bending certain parts. I am looking for more collection.... for my self:)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I gave it a 5 star rating because I just couldn't lay it down.  I couldn't figure out his plot, either, lots of nice twists and turns!
B004J09ONG|5.0|It teaches you about animal life in a kind way without using cartoons.  Beautiful locations and people loving animals. Very nice.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|all I can say is that this book no this series has been really cool and surprisingly realistic with the Greek.and Roman mythology
B003F9G8B8|5.0|awesome movie, very underrated. Not a ton of rugby play or really accurate rugby play but a phenomenal story backs this one up
B008LXZFH6|3.0|Funny for the most part.  My wife did not see it when I did so we recently watched it together.  It was not as funny as I had remembered the second time around.  Still good entertainment for the most part.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was a great movie and to be able to get<br />Bluejay, DVD and streaming for the price I did was outstanding.  Delivery was quick.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This product is a well-built alternative to those cheap chargers you buy at the gas station. Solid contruction, charges quickly and is reasonably priced. Can't ask for more than that.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful writing.  Not what you would expect from the title.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.  Couldn't put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is one of the best book in the history  of the world<br /><br /> I recomend this book for kids who like  hary potter.<br /><br />  exept owen m

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|its super cool I played it on my friends kindle and we had a blast so now I'm getting it for myself!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book. Tremendous management lessons. It starts out sad & disturbing with Jobs' early life. Push through. It gets better. Great to hear about the backstory on all the Apple products. Bottom line:  he was brilliant because he kept focused & kept products simple (which may be harder to do!). He was also very sad and led a torn life. I wish he could have truly known the love of Jesus.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|As always, the lyrics of the songs are really meaningful and the music is just awesome and almost empowering to listen to! LOVE IT
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I had all the rest of the series so ordered this to complete the set.  It arrived in perfect condition and in the specified time period.
157330087X|5.0|When Stevie Ray Vaughan passed, we lost the greatest blues guitar player the world may ever experience. This tribute, and others like Eric Clapton's Crossroad Festival Concert DVDs, keep SRV alive for those of us that are true fans.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Fun movie! Not a telling social comentary. Not a profound documentary. Just a good old fashioned fun end of the world type of flick. If you are expecting something other than that you are wasting your time. Go get a burrito.
B00EUM4ZQE|5.0|I love Natalia and her music, it sounds perfectly put together in contrast to her previous album.<br />HOWEVER, amazon basically censored all the words that make her music HER MUSIC, so, if you're like me and enjoy the cursing, buy her album somewhere else.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD is so timely and is a serious indictment of our food industry.  It arrived in perfect condition and in the specified time period.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Funny....my daughter is 5 and gets a kick out of hearing Ben repeat her.  Not bad for a free app...it is entertaining.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun but a little repetitive. Not as fun as candy crush. Good kids game. I won't delete this one off my Kindell
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|Very cute. Almost as good as Shrek. Could have done without the sexual references. After all, this is a kid's movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|love this series...so happy to be able to finally watch this series.  Looking forward to watching all the rest of the series
B008469DGY|4.0|great way to waste some time. Not very technical and no knowledge of golf really needed to play. Just what I needed.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I am NOT a Angry Bird fan but the Angry Bird Space is actually fun and I can actually get past the first levels. LOVE IT!
B000QFQE4U|4.0|This movie was very long; however, it was good because I used it for a classroom discussion on diversity! Recommended.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the only thing I don't like is that I needed to download this game to complete an action in the epic game and it never gave me credit for it. I also don't like the word min on these rate games
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Nice to be able to access all the channels I follow on my Kindle too. Streams fine with no delays. Totally satisfied!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Currently about halfway through the second season and finding the story lines are beginning to irritate me.  So much tension between all of the characters.  Its really good one minute and the next minute I find myself saying... come on where is this going.  UGH!!!  Not sure how much more I can tolerate since the circumstances don't seem to matter as long as the case is won. Oh, and the dragging out of Mike's story.... who is gonna find him found out next and they won't fire him anyway  (Hey that guy was not in Harvard.., OMG STFU already.<br /><br />Well I am hoping it gets better...
B005LAIH4A|5.0|When this came up for sale I couldn't pass it up.  Great movie and even greater price!  Perfect Christmas gift.
B007AL48UK|2.0|It's too easy. Every game is winnable.  I need more challenge. On the other hand it was free, I think.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|Wow, from all the reviews out there I was expecting to be disappointed. However, this turned out to be an incredibly enjoyable Sci-Fi Action Fantasy film. The film is just GORGEOUS to behold in GRAINLESS! 4K Blu-ray 1080p MPEG-4 AVC. Shot, as was Oblivion, with the new Sony F65 4K-8K cameras. I can't wait for \\"film grain\\" to give up the ghost. Films like Life of Pi and After Earth make you feel like you are right there in the story. The picture is so life like. It's so cool to be blown away by all the fine details that catch your eye too. There so much detail that you are still discovering new stuff on subsequent viewings. Just beautiful like Life of Pi which was shot with the Arri Alexa Digital cameras. Top that off with an incredible DTS 5.1 Master Audio Soundtrack and it's impossible not to enjoy the movie. We don't have the best theaters here in Montana, so I'm so glad I waited to watch it as a fully maximized Blu-ray presentation on my home theater.<br /><br />I found the story quite engaging too. So much so, that I couldn't wait to get back inside after taking my puppy out at 4AM to get back to the movie. I found for me that MNS films are best enjoyed late at night when it's dead quiet and totally dark. That is because his films have so much invested in the cinematography and especially the soundtrack. As such, all my attention could be focused 100% in the movie.<br /><br />From everything I had read about After Earth, I was expecting to see just a glimpse of Will Smith with 99% of the film being all Jaden. I guess all the bashers didn't see the same film I did... There was just the right amount of back and forth between father and son to get me emotionally invested in the characters and their dilemna. Yes there were a couple of times I wish I could of reached in and slapped some sense into the kid, but hey, that is what teenagers are really like! And sure, it's a cornball totally predictable plot, but it's easily enjoyable if you can let all that go and just get into the story. As such, it's a good sci-fi film for the youngsters.<br /><br />I think Jaden Smith has had his best performance so far in After Earth. He did a good job portraying the confused, conflicted, unsure, and frightened teenager he was supposed to be. It was also nice to see some more serious dramatic acting by Will Smith too. It reminded me of his performance in I Am Legend.get into the story.

B00EE3FTNM|5.0|one of the best I have seen in years. now that breaking bad has ended i have another good one to watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The first two books had me on edge just because so much was happening but with the third book I felt relaxed. It was a great way to end the trilogy. Very pleased and I highly recommend.
125000098X|5.0|I've been waiting with bated breath for this installment to arrive. My expectations were met and I am committed to this series....if only Archer could write as fast as I read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun, good graphics, good sounds & music.  Well done.  Not something I play for hours and hours, but when I get the urge, it's a good time killer for 15 minutes or so.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is one of the biggest trilogies since Twilight.<br />I absolutely loved the writing , the characters . . .<br />This book wrapped up the series great :))
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I am so proud of them for making it to were they are right now, and keep making that amazayn music. Every single one of you, never give up one your dream One Direction I know I won't on my singing dream!!
140053271X|1.0|This eReader is a total crap! You can't view detailed images and charts in it as it doesn't have a zoom functionality! this limits it's use to just pure-text ebooks. This issue has been raised ever since it's released and yet B&N has never released an update to make the functionality available.<br /><br />I really regret buying it, no wonder people are trying to sell them off pre-owned. Buy a Kobo mini instead, at nearly the same price it has all the basic functionality you would need from an eReader.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Phil Collins always has had great hits and the collection that they put together makes it easy to buy and listen to all at once.  Love it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was a great follow up to the first book. Absolutely loved this book just as much as the 1st one ...<br />These books are so addicting you wont be able to put them down .
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|But close. A well done movie that is quite enjoyable. The dwarves were not quite what I expected but entertaining and the rest was excellent.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have played this game multiple times. I enjoy it very much. It helps past a lot of time and is fun and exciting. I recommend this game if you are going on a long flight or trip or just want to past time in a fun way.
B009E3EY38|1.0|If you do not have a Blue Ray, you can not watch this. The so-called DVD is a single a camera back of the stage tape of a rehearsal. The main video is on the Blue-Ray disc. Crap. Otherwise, If you like Led Zepplin, you have to get this. The music is so awesome, although on some of the songs, I think Plant is just thinking to himself the whole time, \\"I've sang this a thousand fricking times, I no longer have anything to add\\" and he lacks some enthusiasm, really comes out I think. OTherwise, the star really is Jason (this time), he's just on, like Big O, ON!.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is such a great love story. Yes it had the dirty details of their love affair that makes some of us blush .<br />But the books are so much more. Great writing, great characters ... Ive read them twice . You fall in love with the couple and cant help but root for them.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but it had some grammar errors. He gives you his honest opinion and I appreciate that.
B000I3PERS|5.0|PERFECCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT ooooooooooh my gooooooooood. i really cried watching the end of this. its soooo sad. i want to have williams babies XD hahaha
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Loved Hugh Jackman and rest of cast.  My only negative is the way the ending was portrayed. However, I loved it overall!
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|Colors are funky, but boy is it solid and shows awesome craftsmanship. It is a must buy for case cooling.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game! If you like logic puzzles, these are awesome!! Fun and challenging!<br /><br />Can't wait to try more of these games. Reminds me of a variation of minesweeper, but more challenging and fun!
B00594XOZU|2.0|It always tells me it is taking longer than it should and to try in a bit. It needs to be fixed.
159463176X|5.0|This is the best book My wife & I have read all year.  We absolutely loved it from cover to cover & could not put it down.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I thought it was a great movie.. filled with excitement too.. but.. the ending could have been a little better... but I would definitely watch more than once!!
0439023513|5.0|It made me laugh and cry at completely different times and it was an interesting ending. It seemed realistic considering the context of the situation.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The app is really fun and I love the story to it . This app is really cool if you like animals.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I love it. Great album I like just about every song on this. I wish it had the cruise remix on it too.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It is a very inspirational book and has an easy flowing style. Experiments are fun and easy to do. In my opinion, the way they are set up, they will likely work for most everyone. The author is not trying to have one manifest something extraordinary at all, so I doubt that divine providence is getting involved here :), but of course is fun to think that it is. Noticing beige cars, for example -- of course one will notice them once they start to pay attention outside. Or noticing other things, like unexpected gifts, no matter how small. It is likely that something like this happens more frequently than we think it is, so it will likely happen within about 48 hours. Still it's a fun read and it feels good to think that something bigger is out there, helping us, guiding us, and willing to fulfill our every request, as long as it is specific enough...
0439023491|5.0|This particular series grabbed my attention at the recommendation of a friend. It is awesome and I love the complexity of the character's lives and how they deal with problems.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|At first I thought it was going to be a silly game, but to tell the truth I can't  stop playing. I like it better than subway surfer.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent reading - enjoyable beyond expectations.  The book was chosen because of previous reviews, but I know that everyone has different likes and dislikes.  This book deserves all the praise.
1476734941|5.0|I still haven't had the weight loss that most people say they have had, but I have seen a difference in my waistline and I have dropped 5lbs. I have been following the 2 day plan for about 2 mos.  At this time I am more interested in the other results that could happen; memory improvement for one thing. It's relatively easy to follow so I am going to stay with it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't expect to like this trilogy but I was pleasantly surprised! Love it, I've finished the first two in 3 days!
B00F91G5BS|5.0|I've been told that this movie is not similar to the book in any way, shape or form.  Since I haven't read the book I wasn't in store for any disappointment.  This was a great movie and was filled with action all the way through.  If you're into zombies this is a must watch.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I want a simple game to play on my tablet that isn't a struggle to see, moves quickly and reasonably, and yet remains challenging. Compared to Mahjong on Win 7, the tiles are not quite as clearly marked - retaining the Chinese characters rather than offering any explanation - but it took little time to make the associations. The tiles were easy enough to read in their size and dimension unlike other Android versions that had tiles too small and not well laid out. It also has a variety of challenging layouts with an option to pay to unlock more. I have thoroughly enjoyed this version.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|So I guess it is o.k but I think that every new item should be free for a week but they sometimes make it 20000 dollars and that's for a laser but really that much for a stupid laser who would buy that? Oh buy the way... hi. Ok I'm done now
0770437400|4.0|Very interesting read with too many characters. It's the type of book that requires concentration. I bought it because it was made into a movie and I prefer to read the real thing first.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the main characters.  They seemed so comfortable with each other even after not seeing each other for such a long time.  As so often is the case, the sequel is a let down - Before Sunset definitely does not fit into this category!  I highly recommend both movies and, if possible, be sure to see Before Sunrise first!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|My husband really enjoyed this book and read several parts to me. I had not heard the story since my youth, so, it brought back many memories.
B002RKS81O|5.0|They are not called \\"classic literature\\" for nothing. I loved this book and really enjoyed reading it. Thank you Miss Austen.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|what I would like to write about this movie surely wouldn't get approved....that being said this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. it seemed to be a movie more about brad pitt than about a zombie apocalypse.now that being said there was really no story line to this unlike the many story lines of the book. other than zombies it had absolutely nothing to do with the book. even if I hadn't yet read the book I would still be very disappointed in this movie because it was all about pitt not about a working story. the zombies were more like roided out meth heads or someone on bath salts than zombies. the change time was also unrealistic 10 seconds from bite to zombie in every case.....if you really really want to see this save some money and wait for it to go on sale because it will.
140006922X|5.0|Many have written about  the historical Jesus in the last few years. As a pastor of 40 years, I've struggled with all the hoopla about 'who' the historical Jesus really was. So I was a little hesitant to read another book about him. However Reza Aslan draws upon good scholarship to see Jesus largely as a zealous defender of the faith beneath the weighty template of Roman domination in Israel. Relying on Josephus's ANTIQUITIES as well as secular historical sources, Aslan imagines a much more robust messianic-type Jewish zealot (of which there were many before and after Jesus). Although Aslan's Jesus is  unwilling to lift a military sword against the dominate force surrounding his people, he will nonetheless vigorously make his zealot imprint through his teachings and healing and passion - his own kind of 'sword' - to carry he banner of liberation as God forges a new kingdom for God's people. Aslan may recapitulate what many writers have already written about Jesus, but his kick ass honesty about Jesus as 'zealot' brings the reader closer to Jesus' historical reality than many previous writers.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|a friend got me to read this book.  She absolutely loved it...laughter to tears..the whole spectrum of emotions.  It did not do that for me.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|What else do you want me to say, they are awesome. I saw them live in Germany and I could wait for this album to release.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Decent movie, entertaining, and well made of course considering who is in it -- but lacked any really interesting twists or imaginative originality on the zombie genre. it struck me as very similar to The Walking Dead TV series only from the government's perspective and with much faster moving zombies. Probably worth a rental but not a purchase.
B002KKCWP4|1.0|Bought these for my husband for our Disney trip, and for the walking we did for our trip, they were fine, when they were new.  He has now owned them for less than 6 months, and wears them on the weekends at our lake cottage.  This past weekend, one of the straps came out where the strap is glued or sewn into the sole.  I had expected better quality from Teva based on the reviews I had seen before buying these. They were wonderful while they lasted......hubby liked the comfort and fit.  I just can't recommend them for durability.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is great app. I don't understand what's going on with other peoples devices because ot works just fine on my Kindle Fire. I've had this app for almost 2 years now and sometimes it will say 'force close' but then when you go back into it, it will work fine. I've always been able to find what I was looking for and you can even download movies! But hey, why don't you check ot out for yourself? I really hope you enjoy this app because I did (and still do)! :)
B008Y212PI|4.0|A very enjoyable game. Not too hard, but not too easy. Writing a review even gets you a bonus round. Well played a developers.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game!! Very into it love the concept very well put together. Would recommend this game to anyone that loves bubble popping
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Ender as the Speaker of the Dead is somethign I never expeced at the end of Enders Game. It makes sense as I progressed through the history of Card's writings.<br />There is a lot of unspoken meaning woven throughout the story. Knowing Cards hisotory will help to unravel his thinking and the reasons why he writes using a God head/Savior tenent.  An enxellent book. I recomment it highly.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I loved this on my PC, glad to see it available for Kindle Fire. So far the game plays much as it did on the PC, have not reached upper levels.  Fun game.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|What a terrific actor! Martin Freeman is as well! These stories are written extremely well and to have such fine actors portray these roles only make it better.
B00B2TUF62|5.0|I was skeptical of the band's new sound but I have all their albums on vinyl and have to say this does not disappoint!
B009CGCQPU|5.0|My favorite version of a wonderful classic.  Outstanding cast of characters that bring the story to life and make you feel a part of it all.
B00EZZ9W3C|5.0|He just keeps getting better. This album includes the song  &#34;Water Under Bridges&#34; , which I heard a few years ago on Gregory's website. That song is one of the reasons I fell in love with his voice and style. Brilliant.
B004132I20|5.0|I was at first apprehensive about a modern day Sherlock Holmes. However after watching the first episode those feelings were gone. The stories are just so fun and interesting! I wish I could be Sherlock!
B0084RSYEK|2.0|Not as funny as expected. Interesting but not funny. The cursing in this movie wasn't necessary. I think Eddie Murphy is better in action movies. He can be funny in the right movie.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Not a spectacular book, but pretty good. The characters are well developed and the story flows well. Not enough suspense for me though.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|there are 3 reviews on this board and one of the three is a snarky, nasty attempt at a putdown of the artist and her fans at the same time as demonstrating hatred for the current President of the United States.  Haters are all over the internet and now they extend it to music reviews.  Has anyone from Amazon read the nasty review?  That has no place on this board.  In any case, I can say that this artist has taken a big risk at her young age and the result is a terrific mix of musical styles sure to  please all her old and new fans.  It's better than I expected and reminds me of the breakthrough albums for other young female pop/ rock artists who dared to take a chance and hit \\" homeruns\\"  I am 50 years older than the artist and happy to say I can enjoy this without comparing it to anything else; enjoy it for it's own sake.  I think this is going to be a huge album for her and is a breakthrough from a teen idol to a rising artist
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really enjoy how they wrote these new Star Trek shows. I am a big fan of all the Star Trek shows, and this really compliments the original Star Trek without trying to replace it. Benedict Cumberbatch is a fantastic actor. I really enjoy watching him in all his roles. He portrayed Khan brilliantly.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is addicting. I really enjoy playing it. If you like solitare you will enjoy this game. Have fun
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it it is sassy to work with and fury.  . . . . . . .. . . . . ............@opposite ink. gyve. oh ya has. ben. nit wok. with. u
B006QNDDHW|5.0|This book is soooo good. It really explains what it takes to do an excellent presentation, and gives lots of examples. Anyone can use it to create presentations that are streets ahead of the norm.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Everything you need to schedule for M-F, 9~5PM job w/ auto repeat options.  I never ever have to change or remember to reset my alarm, and I could set an alternate alarm for my Saturdays, alternative Fridays, and Sunday mornings.  Couldn't asked for more from this app, I never forget my alarm even when I come home too exhausted and just fell asleep.  It does consume some battery to keep time, but it's far less significant when compared to other alarm apps out there.  Would not recommend ever shutting down your Kindle completely or let the battery ran out of juice when you have this app alarm on.  It would messes with the program and force shut down when you shut down/ ran out of battery on the Kindle completely.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a fun game, but the objects in the scenes can sometimes be hard to find. Otherwise, an interesting game.
B000MGATTE|5.0|I absolutely love the way Stephen King spins a tale. He always brings back past parts of the book and brings it to life again so the whole story sticks in your head and becomes a real story...A plus writing in my book can't wait to start reading the next book I ordered...
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. I can't seem to stop playing. Works well on kindle fire with no problems. I am writing this review to unlock the bonus puzzle.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Good movie, lots of action from start to finish. The Special effects were awesome. I would rent this movie again
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game very much  there should be a 2nd one. its very very fin i love it very much!
B004XZR63M|5.0|I really bought this book with some doubts of the value on it, but found out it's an extraordinary book with excellent advice. I would recommend it to anyone who is an employee of some form.
0312641893|5.0|I could not put this book down. I never thought in a million years I could get into something about &#34;Cyborgs,&#34; but it is totally awesome!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I only read this book after watching the movie, and I wasn't disappointed. I found myself enjoying the book more than the movie (But honestly when isn't that true?). I found the characters interesting and the story line fun and intriguing. Despite knowing what would happen I still found myself glued to the story and the romance.<br /><br />The romance is complicated (when isn't it?) and had a fabulous twist I hadn't thought was coming. The humor was fun and nerdy. Even if you have seen the movie, the book has its own flare that makes the story new and just as enjoyable.<br /><br />I will continuing reading this series because the ending of the movie was completely different then the book I am truly curious.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I loved this app but now it doesn't let you log in and it messes up. Now I hate it.
B00EJRSFC0|4.0|I enjoy reading Isabel Allende, so I picked up this book without looking at the reviews.  I expected a fictional story, but this was more like an autobiography.  I thoroughly enjoy Allende's style of writing so I was not disappointed.  I also like historical novels, so I found the background on Chile interesting and at times revealing.  I like reading in Spanish to keep up my bilingual skills.  So this book was a win win for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have had so much fun with this game!  I play every night before I go to bed. It really helps my mind to slow down.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|Not as flexible as I thought it would be.  Or maybe I just need more practice.  Maybe my granddaughter could instruct me to make better use of this.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Good application to use, makes memory free and makes your life easier... I see th  better performance in my kindle after running this scan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always had a love for horses and this way i can learn how to take  care of it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is great game for grandchildren. they loved movie now can play with those little guys. the 10 year old uses it the most because of the hand eye movements.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|My wife and I started watching this series on Amazon Prime Streaming a few months ago and did a lot of binge watching to catch up before the new season started on CBS.  Well written and well acted.
B005RZB65Q|5.0|I chose this rating because Dr. Dweck makes a forceful case in favor of the &#34;growth mindset&#34;. Having this kind of mindset in a school can make a huge difference in students' academic performance and subsequent success (and happiness) as productive adults.
B005544V6A|5.0|Season 2 is a lot better but Season 1 is a pretty strong start and keeps you entertained.  Fun show with light drama.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had to order this replacement cable because, like so many others, the original cord for my Kindle frayed at the end. This replacement works with my second generation Kindle and my Samsung Galaxy s2. I haven't had it long enough to know whether this one will fray as well. However, after reading through the other reviews, it sounds like a common problem.
0763644765|5.0|When this book first arrived, I liked it and felt it shows all the various parts of using the potty.  Soon after, my little toddler liked it too but then he loved it and would ask for me to read it over and over again.  He has sat on the potty several times and has been able to pee but no poop yet.  At times, he has even taken one of his dad's magazines from the side of the big toilet and sat on his potty just like in the book, waiting for something to happen.  I made the mistake of rushing out the bathroom to get the camera to take a picture of such a cute moment that I then distracted him from his task.  I highly recommend this one over other ones that show more details and use more elaborate language.
B002QBS9KE|4.0|Fits my ear, and performs to normal standards.  I love the fact that they send you 3 because one will always seem to break, so sending 3 will help my device last longer.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Excellant writing and it held my interest all through the book..  I will read all of his writings. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the Reacher novels.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Excellent material, can't go wrong with the Allman Bros. Mr. Betts rules on guitar. Rates with Carlos and Alvin Lee.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Gotta love how realistic Drew is to today's men. Super funny and honest. I also love that Kate is tough. Don't like wimpy girls in books, that need to be saved and provided for by the lead male.
B00BI5IXL4|1.0|The major issue I find with this version of the musical is the lack of music. Having listen to and seen the musical at the Kennedy center in DC their is no sound or punch with the score.. With today's technology this music should be driving the images put it does not .. It as if the music was an after thought... WEBBER's  brilliance is not in this score
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Pacific Rim was Del Toro's amazing homage to the glory that is giant Mecha robots. An anime-esque type of outing with a series worth of lore jam-packed into a movie length action romp that is a visual spectacle for the ages. Every fight was nail-biting-worthy and every actor held their own. The story and history they installed into this movie is amazing and definitely worth picking over other series that tries to do what Pacific Rim did right.
0486211045|5.0|this kind of information its not new, but it is important to have it in my workshop to use it easily.
B0035HKWM6|5.0|Even after watching it for so many years when I was a child, I found myself cracking up laughing as I watched it once more in HD.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|An absolutely amazing KoRn album, A must have for the(korn kollection). I highly recommend this disc to anyone, Love you guys.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|As author explains, there is not a lot of information to base the book on, however I now know some of the thought patterns of people who are not concerned with faith, but facts.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|So I never read the shining, just saw the movie.<br /><br />Was able to follow along from the movie.<br /><br />This kept my attention...<br /><br />This closes the story well and answers the question of what Happens to the little boy with extraordinary powers.<br /><br />I have other Sk books I liked better but if you are a fan of the first story.. This is a must read.
B00F2J2LRE|1.0|Ok I realize the COVER isn't really CHER's fault but the Cover reminds me of a cross between one of those Shopping mall Glamoure Shots photos and that lady from that \\" Life Alert\\" commercial that's yelling \\"Help I've fallen and I can't get up!\\" Bleached blonde hair Cosmetic surgery from head to toe Botox then obviously retouched photo and She chooses the title \\" CLOSER TO THE TRUTH \\" ????? lol OK. The vocals? Well some people like this old late 1980's style music but sounds like a a Drag Queen in a lounge act that isn't very good. Sad but true Money Fame and Influential friends are NOT synonymous with education and intelligence. CHER is old enough to know better then to make DEATH THREATS to members of Society that don't agree with her political views >  [...]  Especially after people are now learning that Entertainers are going to be EXEMPT FROM Obamacare and Pelosi publically stated that TAXPAYERS would be TOTALLY COVERING the cost of healthcare for performers under Obamacare >   [...]  And THAT'S \\" CLOSER TO THE TRUTH \\" !
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is the first figure I've bought, and I'm so glad I decided to order it! She's super adorable. She is smaller than I expected her to be, so I'm very impressed with the details that went into everything. Unlike some other reviews I've seen, the paint on my figure is crisp and precise.<br />She isn't as...ball-jointy (the only way I can think to describe it) as some other posable figures I've seen so that is a HUGE plus for me. Her hands are so, so tiny! The only thing I worry about, and this is solely on me, is that I might accidentally bump the package while switching things around and send her tiny accessories flying in a million directions to be lost forever. But the package has holders for all the pieces and if you're careful then it shouldn't be a worry. As for her pose-ability- I'm still new at this, so I'm pretty clumsy with it. At first I couldn't get her to stand on her base, but after some adjusting, the arm holds her there very well. The only thing that sort of bums me out is that from the pictures, it looks like her arm can reach the middle of her forehead if you put her in her transformation ending pose, but it actually doesn't quite reach. &#34;I shall punish you!&#34; also doesn't come out as precise. So just FYI to any real sticklers, the pictures have most likely been doctored. Not enough to downright lie- she can still make those poses- but they aren't going to be quite so accurate.<br />I've seen some other reviews saying that their packaging was poor and their boxes were damaged but mine arrived just fine.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product. Simple to use. Will get better as more applications and hardware become compatible. Worth the money. I was able to start using it in less than 5 minutes.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Women can be nothing but trouble, many of us can relate to this movie.  Pretty much sums it movie up!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Fun. Not too easy it too hard! Recommended! If you want an escape game to fill some time, but not so hard you bang your head against the wall, then this game is for you.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Chapman knows what he is taking about. 30 plus years of experience in his field really shows.  He has pinpointed my issues without having me as a patient. Easy read and interesting.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I really don't know what can I say about this concert. Her voice is amazing and the concert production is perfect. The musicians are amazing too. She speaks a lot during all the show and it gets a little funny sometimes.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|Lovely story, very entertaining.  If you haven't seen the YouTube videos yet take some time & find them.<br />Really enjoyed reading about BOB the big issue cat<br /> :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Plot twists had me riveted and by the end of the book couldn't put it down. Great read and loved the connections between characters.
B005544V6A|5.0|They're already onto season 3 and no season 2 yet.  Please make season 2 available as soon as you can.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Brings hope for the future. Loved this book. Excellent writing and well thought. I heard the book was way better than the movie and I can't imagine  movie getting close to the emotion and connection k. The book.
B00594XOZU|1.0|i think this app is terrible it keeps on saying that it is taking longer than it should,try again later. and it wont let me log in
B009LDD1X0|5.0|CBS did it again, another fantastic season for a fantastic series. This season does not disappoint. Cant wait til next season!
B0000560X3|1.0|This is a DVD audio disk.  It sucks that for $50 you can not put it on an ipod.<br />I will try and return it since it is a used item also.
B002X6PTH8|5.0|I like this movie the special effects the dance is a very nice movie for the whole family Great movie
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Wonderful and unique characters... but way too sad for me. I cried for the entire last third of the book. Interesting  thoughts on life and death.
B00AW57L96|4.0|A really great book... Perfect for some holiday reading. Just reading a second one from the same author and enjoying this one too.
B000MDJH9A|3.0|The movie was okay, but not something I would watch again or recommend to anyone. I thought the previous reviews gave the movie more justice than its worth.
B0076I624W|5.0|I purchased this blu-ray to replace the dvd copy I had of it. Love the music and the detailed picture quality in it.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I happened to be up late one evening and started watching a documentary on the War of Currents.  I unfortunately fell asleep, so in return this show created an interest in the subject.  I found this book to be very well written. I enjoyed learning the perils of this creation as well as the other patents that were created.  I had no idea about the scandalous events that were set through by our major innovators.  I also enjoyed that we need to remember to use imagination in our lives.  We never know when an idea may arise and we debunk it by rationalizing and moving on in our day.  It was a great read and thank you for stemming my curiosity in new books.
B00AFZ86BA|5.0|What is not to love about this complete set for a RATT fan!  No need to buy them seperately, they are all here in one nice set for a great price!!  Couldn't wait to open it, and start listening.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2.It's so fun playing this app. I would reccomend this app.I would love it if you guys and girls get this app.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is an awesome game! I have bought and loved all the &quot;Twisted&quot; games. Everything about it held my interest and kept me busy for a long time - well worth the .99. Waiting (im)patiently for the next one!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble again delivers his worldly voice in a great collection of old and new songs.  Songs will have you tapping your feet with rhthym or swaying with warm tones of an old fav.  I think I need another copy for my car.  You will NOT be disappointed with this albumn
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this set of books so much more than I did the 50 shades of grey set. Cant wait to read more in the next book.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I've been a Fringe fan from the beginning. I have the first 3 seasons, all in standard definition. The program can't &#34;be&#34; any better-in my opinion-but, it certainly looks better!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is perfect for saving notes, journaling, saving pics, etc.  you also can make audio notations.  This app is versatile without quirks.  The best part is you can always access your evernote account from any pc, or device without any complications.  I have used this app for a couple of years and have NO complaints!
B0000041WV|4.0|I became familiar with Kertesz and the LSO from his recordings of the Dvorak symphonic poems, which are from roughly the same period.  His interpretation conveys the ethnic flavor of these symphonies well, and the performance of the LSO overall is very good.  The sound quality is also pretty good (but perhaps not the very best) for the 1960's.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying arrangement of the symphonies on the CDs, but since I only play them from the computer or ipod, this is a non-issue for me.  The price is nice, and I recommend the set.<br /><br />One odd observation: Symphony No. 7, 3rd mvt, seems to have a couple of spots where the audio goes dead, the 1st beginning at 1:50 into the track and ending at 3:01.  Since my copy of this CD was positively confirmed with the Accurate Rip database, I think the error is inherent to the master itself.  If so, it is a sad blemish on an otherwise wonderful recording.  Has anyone else heard this?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|LOVED IT.  I enjoyed this set of books so much more than I did the 50 shades of grey books. Didn't feeling like I wasted my money like I did after reading them.<br />I finished all 3 books in one weekend. Cant wait for the next book.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I'm so glad to have received it ,because now I can enjoy my kindle better and faster thanks so much.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Great read if you can get over the language of a child! A book that highlights human survival and coping mechanism.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I definitely like the app for the game itself (I mean, who doesn't love Iron Man?) but I am still encountering difficulties with Gameloft! Constantly freezes my Kindle Fire. But I really do love the game, especially with the option to switch from touch controls to &#34;Gyro&#34; (tilt) control. Not a huge fan of the artwork ... wish Tony looked more like Robert Downey Jr ... but it still looks like Tony Stark, more or less. What's not to love?<br /><br />I would recommend this app, unless you have the same Gameloft issues I do. I loved the game but had to uninstall it because of that.
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed this set of books so much more than I did the 50 shades of grey set. Cant wait to read more in the next book.
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|A horrible mess of a movie. Way to much is trying to be conveyed--and none of it done well. The flying suit pieces are the insult to injury. The flying drone suits-the final straw. Epic fail.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|worst acting of john Travolta ever....<br /><br />now im just typing stuff randomly in order to be able to hit the submit button
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like this app better than other YT downloader apps because of two really big factors: (a) I can watch videos within the app, and (b) it looks just like mobile YouTube! So I can easily navigate the app and I also have the option to download vids in mp3 format, as audio in my music library! Definitely recommend.
B007SPPANM|5.0|It's 194 minutes of great writing and acting. I highly recommend this movie for nothing else than the great costumes.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King books are ones I can read again and again. They never get old.  I get lost in his world just as much the second time as the first!
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I found out about Passion Pit through listening to a ubiquitous internet radio app that I shall not now buzz market. &#34;Little Secrets&#34; from 2009's Manners plays on a regular, and I just loved it and found myself always dancing along. Gossamer has beginning to end synthpop heavenly beats that could make even the most stoic of people (me) start jumping all around. Track no. 3, &#34;Carried Away&#34;, has to currently be my favorite tune. I'll play it on repeat at least three times before moving on to the rest of this spectacular album. Thank you, Passion Pit, for making music that marries '80s dance with contemporary adult alternative.
B004QBWU02|5.0|I can watch this over and over again, I bought this copy for my sister and received it pretty quick, just in time for her birthday
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle. So I completely recommend it, No issues downloading the app or afterwards.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am so addicted to it!!! Yes it does has it cons but this is so much better than any other websites... You don't need to talk and its safe.. But beware once you start it there's no going back!!!
B001HIJYR4|3.0|Fairly decent film that will make you want to curb the bullet. Cough cough. Load of s*** but the surprise ending is worthy of a purchase. Film could have been way better wo Angelina Jolie in it...someone fun. Its typical Jolie again again again show the lips, make the guys interested/uncomfortable w your oh so powerful presence...the same routine. It could have killed w a badas* but fun chick...
B001LF4IA6|5.0|All the gritty Bruce!  great CD.  WEould recommend to anyone that likes his style of music. As good as any CDs of his that I have enjoyed in the past.
0470449756|5.0|I recommend this purchase because the book it is cheaper than buying it from the original website. The books is brand new and the same, so thats all I care about it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the story within the story..  This novel held me from cover to cover!  I will read it again.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is by far best game on the kindle. It has great graphics. When my friend saw me playing this he said it looks as good as mw2 on the xbox 360. Totally worth 7 dollars. If I could I would have given this game a 10/5 stars. Good job gameloft. Oh I almost forgot about the online. It is hard to get use to but its great and active (and slightly addicting).
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|No stereotypical characters here.  Instead these are people with complex personalities and motivations, just like people in real life.  I loved the twists and turns in the story.
0470449764|5.0|I recommend this purchase because the book it is cheaper than buying it from the original website. The books is brand new and the same, so thats all I care about it.
B00ECAXMLI|5.0|A timeless classic and always fun to return to and read again and again. I love the use words that are rare in our modern speech.
B000002LIM|5.0|Danny Elfman makes great music.  I've never had a Danny Elfman soundtrack before, and decided it was way past time to get one.  I chose Batman because I LOVE the character and the movie was one of my favorites as a kid.  Actually it still is a favorite.  What's great about this is how dark and moody the music is as well as majestic and heroic.  The conductor on this score was also great at making great music.  Shirley Walker went on to work on many Batman episodes for the animated series that this and Batman Returns helped to create.  As a Batman fan I am VERY proud to be the owner of this soundtrack.  Whether a Bat-fan or not, this is a great CD to add to your collection.
0810997827|5.0|Bought this collection for my sons and thank God he is actually reading them!  If you have a picky son who does not like to read - I suggest these books...

B000JCSBU0|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is a film you'll probably only want to see once. I saw it three times but i wouldn't necessarily recommend repeat viewings for everyone. this is not Trainspotting. there is absolutely nothing cool or fun about this film. it's an examination of addiction in all its forms and the director is relentless in driving his point home. Marlon Wayans has never been this good in anything before or after. Everyone else is amazing as well, i just point him out because he's normally quite a goof and i would never have imagined that he would be able to pull off such a serious role so well. see it when you think you'll be able to get yourself out of the dark place it is certain to take you to.
B00867HDTA|4.0|Quick loading and fun, fast play make this a superb cell phone game. Can't wait for achievements and online scores.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  I don't know if you were consider this a Family Night Movie - depends on the age of the children...
B000N90JG8|4.0|Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are great.in this touching film, but the film is twenty minutes too long. I still recommend it.
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|this is a mob classic that deserves all the praise it gets. wonderfully acted. more down to earth and probably realistic than something like the god father. but it completely broke my heart. don't worry, no spoilers here, but i definitely got choked up watching it and even just remembering it. completely engrossing film.
B004GYY714|5.0|i love free radio... as it should be.... always.SIRIUS SAT RADIO  can go back where it came from.......<br />MAKE TV THIS WAY TOO PLEASE!
B001DHXT20|5.0|The kids can't stop watching!  Neither can I; and I actually preferred this version than another one version I seen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game but I have an idea where there are inter sections  and on way to go is straight one right and one left and maybe some indications where smaller monkeys from the first game would jump or slide across the track in front of you or you could harmonious coming straight at you and you have to jump(no slide required). But other than some good ideas it's the best mobile game (and most addictive) ever!!!
B005UT29Z0|4.0|i loved it! these days it might be hard to believe you could have a great suspense w/ absolutely no action, no chase scenes, no guns, no shouting but this kept me at the edge of my seat. as every other reviewer mentioned it's a view into one firm at the beginning of the 2008 global financial crises and how they discover the impending catastrophe and how the management decides to handle it. if you don't like talkies this isn't for you. otherwise go for it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The box set is perfect for what I wanted and it didn't take long to get them either. I recommend this product.
B000066AXE|5.0|Watch this movie for a class and never thought about watching before when it was on Cable.  I actually enjoyed it!
B00BRUPICM|4.0|This was an inviting and satisfying read which took its reader through some unexpected twists and turns.  The conclusion is a bit rushed and the translation is not perfect, but overall a good read.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|An easy reading book on an age old subject of falling in love. But from a totally new perspective. Could not put it down, simply wonderful
B00AZ6RSFE|5.0|I am not a big movie watcher and I have watched this show at least 3 times since I got the movie. I want to say it got to my house 2 days after I ordered it! Very speedy! I am very pleased and of course it was less expensive than the stores! I give this seller a solid five stars!
0062119044|5.0|This novel sketches a perfect picture of the antisocial: smug, perpetually bored, narcissistic, without a conscience or the capacity to bond emotionally with others, Kevin is only temporarily filled with a sense of purpose in life only by acts of destruction. The reason why he kills his sister, his father and his classmates doesn't answer any cosmic or even social \\"why's\\" that people ask in light of such senseless tragedies. Like a much earlier novel on the subject, The Bad Seed, the novel accurately suggests that some people are born hollow, with the capacity for evil. In depicting evil for what it is: primarily as an innate (rather than socially-motivated) deficiency of empathy, of love, of caring for others, \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" offers a psychologically accurate depiction of the antisocial. The novel's compelling and stark characterizations, its literary style and the relentless irony--with many touches of dark humor--are reminiscent of Nabokov's Lolita.
B0044WUIHA|4.0|see it if you havn't yet. Tom hanks is a brilliant actor and film works well all the way. see it again!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen so many versions of this movie and this is the best! The actors are incredible and talented!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A lot of fun! Pretty challenging and not repetitive. I wish there were more than ten levels. I like all the different codes.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|If one is expecting a movie that examines substance abuse in all its depth and complexity as well as providing a totally accurate portrayal of rehab, \\"28 Days\\" is not the movie to watch. However, if one is content with a production that takes alcoholism seriously, does not see it as a laughing matter, and provides some insight into the tragedy of alcoholism and the skewered thinking of those tortured by the demons of the bottle, this is a movie worth viewing.<br /><br />We meet Gwen (Sandra Bullock) when she is on her way along with her playboy boyfriend to her sister's wedding. Drunk when she arrives, she manages to get even more drunk, makes a fool of herself, and before long crashes into the cake when losing her balance on the dance floor. Trying to make amends, she commandeers a limo and takes it on an unsteady ride as she loos for a bakery. Needless to say, she doesn't make it, but crashes into a house. Faced with the choice between prison time and rehab, Gwen chooses the latter. It's at this point where the movie gains in depth. For it is while Gwen is in rehab that we begin to see the real battle that takes place within the addictive personality.<br /><br />The multitalented Sandra Bullock is what makes this movie as good as it is. Always a fine actor, capable of filling many different roles, Bullock is at her best in this film.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Being alive is serious and not letting it all slip through your hands while wasting years on foolish fritter and waste can have devastating consequences. This book, uniquely written is a winner and delightfully easy to read as an e-book. I can pick it up whenever and read a few pages and feel the intention refresh artistic perspectives.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie was made beautifully! The actors were great and talented!  I wished they would make a part 2 continuation of the story!
B00FF8OKJE|4.0|I have not tried it, but when my daughter asked to download it - I had to restrict her screen time because it's like kid crack . I can't get her off it. She normally plays games like spore or minecraft so it must be decent. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't so addicting LOL
B0063GORYU|4.0|Don't know why I find this so addictive but I do. You should try it. Just say yes. You too can be late for work.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|The game was pretty repetitive and mindless. Good for a distraction, but I wouldn't pay money for it. Very limited replay value.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I love this version of this movie! the actors are great! If you want to see this movie I would highly recommend it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I almost read this book couple of years ago but put it down an  never picked it back up. Orson Scott card is a master at combining just the right amount of mystery and excitement that it is nearly impossible to put this book down. I can't wait to read the rest of these books!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Streaming any page of the browser to big screen, for $35 only, what? I was waiting it for several years!<br />It's easy to configure, just plug and use (chromecast software should be installed before).
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This series is amazing - it's well written and well acted.  USA has done it again and it's well worth the time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Our 4 yr-old loves this game. We just downloaded it, so we haven't played it a lot. But, so far, so good!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So much faster than the other versions. I can browse through my messages so much faster. I'm liking this app.
0440237688|4.0|When I first read the summary for this novel, I thought it would be similar to George Orwell's 1984 or a piece of modern, post-apocalyptic science-fiction. The story had similar characteristics such as: a \\"Big-Brother\\" type government and a society jaded by post-traumatic-stress, but surprisingly the novel set itself apart from other books of this nature. I was pleasantly surprised with the suspense throughout the novel. As soon as I thought I could predict their next move, the characters took me by surprise. Jonas comes across as a happy, satisfied child who wants-for-nothing. Living with his father, mother and sister, Lily, they seem like a very normal family. As the story progresses you learn of his communities need for \\"sameness\\" and callousness. When he is presented with his job as \\"Receiver,\\" he is honored that the elders chose him for such a highly-respected position. Although he doesn't know much about his assignment, Jonas is excited and eager to start his job. As the Giver starts to train him, the reader is on an emotional rollercoaster ride as they find Jonas' position being less of an honor and more of a burden. Every truth he encounters leads him to a lie about his seemingly perfect community. Every emotional forbiddance becomes more of a temptation. The safety of sameness becomes a danger! Besides the beginning of the book being a little slow, I would definitely suggest this as a must-read! I was in high school when this book was published. It is unfortunate that this wasn't on our required summer reading list!
B009RH9HDS|5.0|It is very easy to hold in any position or laying in your lap. I like that you can also stand it up on a table. All you have to do to open your book is to flip the cover open and slide.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|I use Foxit PDF Reader on both my laptops, and also install it on every system that I work on; it is an extremely well-written piece of software, and it NOT the massive resource hog known as Adobe Reader.  It only made sense to me to have it on my Kindle too!
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is ok but has bad graphics and takes forever. If you want to play a game just like this but better graphics and you don't have to evolve your dragons.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I bought this app because I was told I could download files from Dropbox and sync notes with Evernote.  Neither of these functions are working.  I am highly highly disapointed. .
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|I liked it a lot. I thought it was very interesting and funny too! It relates to so Many shoppaholics out there including me!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Randomized the d and a great deal with it was a few years back to go to bed at the d be friends and I
B0039PPW60|3.0|I've had this for a few months now and the first channel stopped working. I've since lost the receipt so my only resort is to send it to my local music store to fix. For the money I spent, it seemed to be a bargain, but I've reconsider the price I paid vs shelling out a few more dollars for a Mackey equivalent.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH. IT IS VERY CHALLENGING AND ADVENTUREOUS. I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE GAMES TO COME.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|So fun you will love it it Is so much like uno a lot do get this app right now!
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Starts as a poetic, spell-binding, dream-like narrative of the unimaginable horror of existing in North Korea and ends in the fashion of a worst possible, brain numbing Hollywood creation.  I have seldom been more disappointed.  The  Pulitzer  prize has become a political tool.  Shameful.
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|What is not to like, the same great artists as  LZ 1 and some of their most famous tunes. Whole Lotta Love, LL Maid, if you have LZ you have to have this.
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|Very good movie!  Not the hilarious picture I thought it would be, but very enjoyable.  My family really enjoyed it and one I'm glad that we added to our collection!
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|My friends had been talking about apps for just talking to random people and i looked up these apps and found Badoo. Its pretty awesome. Im already talking with people from all around the world.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love it! So nice I actually watched it twice. I watched the entire season over the course of a day.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you take this to heart, truly believe it, it will change your life.  This is so simple, so brilliantly easy.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Drew me in and kept me entertained.  The story is great and helps me to understand a culture that is not my own.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This game would be better if there were not so many advertisements and if your game play tokens would fill faster. As it is I can only play about three to four games a day.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Perfect game for my kids.... Great, awesome, this remains me when I was a kid. Thank you and thank you
B00F1RR3Y8|4.0|Don't know much about the app or its performance, but my daughter loves playing this game. She plays it regularly.
B003CH9PV8|5.0|I did not see this series from the beginning and only saw a few episodes.<br />In itself, this pilot would be a masterpiece.<br />The acting is too good to be true.<br />Must see this from the first episode to gain a feel for the characters.<br /><br />Pure magic.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Lovely entertaining and easy to read. Really enjoyed the characters and their idiosyncrasies.  great holiday read. Would make a great xmas gift
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app. I check it everyday. I like the different screens it gives you. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes keeping up on weather conditions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Be sure you have everything done that you want to get done for the day before starting this game. It's a time stealing,  addictive, fun game. You won't want to stop.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved the book. It's a great story, the writing is so easy to read. I never knew about the orphan train
B00EO10M54|4.0|Miley is controversial. Personally, I don't feel it is genuine controversy. What do I mean by not genuine? The strong attempt at trying to shed her child image, and throw away her Disney past is obvious. I don't blame her for trying to break into becoming a real artist. Often, child stars can't break out of that box and become has been's quickly, with age. Despite the desperate image and attitude change, the project behind the facade is an actual solid one. Every artist who begins young has a \\"coming of age\\", album. Take Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\", the only difference between that project and Miley's is Christina's true vocal ability. Miley's vocal hiccups are covered up on this album by strong production and auto tune. Yet, her vocals aren't bad enough for me to skip the tracks. She has high vocal moments on the project, but the low ones remind you that she's not really a seasoned vocalist, nor does she claim to be.<br /><br />The album takes you on a wild ride between fun, serious, and often meaningful records. Even, the fun records like \\"4x4\\", and \\"#GetItRight\\", have underlining lyrics that actually make sense. \\"Wrecking Ball\\", is the albums stand out track that actually sets Miley in the \\"potential\\" box, and proves that with a lot of patience, and assistance she can turn into something brilliant. All in all, \\"Bangerz\\" is an album worth buying. It provides great car ride music, amazing production, and a rebellious spirit. The title describes the album to a tee, it bangs. You will quickly find yourself singing along, and nodding your head, and then quickly second guessing yourself. Don't be afraid to like the album. I don't particularly like Miley, but I like her project. I'd recommend Miley stick with the same producers from Bangerz, I think they've set her up for an actual music future.<br /><br />Signed,<br />An unbiased (non super-fan) listener
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Naps, bedtime, baths, reading, de-stressing.... wherever and whenever you want to relax, this app takes it to a whole new level.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|my 8 year old son has a flare for picking apps...and he LOVES this one.  he has said he wished there were more vehicles because he unlocked them all in a matter of a couple of hours of playing time.  yet he continues playing and playing.  its the app he starts with when he picks up the kindle!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was my first introduction to JoJo Moyes....a recommendation from a friend in a book club....what a thought provoking and well written story...am already perusing Ms Moyes other novels and am looking forward to reading the next one on my list!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It's fun  but needs to have updates I love it the music the levels but I beat it in 1hour
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is perfect for any age and it describes many things that may have been happening in your life
B00F91RYL8|2.0|The subject line pretty much sums it up.  Impossible scenarios, constant &#34;he just barely escaped&#34; scenes, and a silly ending to set up for a sequel that we all know will never be produced.  No spoilers here, other than to say I think it should have been titled, &#34;World War Zzzzzzzzzzzzz&#34;.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So far it's an excellent calculator. I would recommend it to anyone. As a matter of fact I think I will.
B00CTT9646|5.0|great thanks it was very much lots of plenty fun for me and my wife kids plus shooting the dog many many laughing also and the cat.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is really entertaining. easy enough that my 8 year old can play. relaxing if you are tired of beat the clock games.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I remember the villain's character in the original series and the movie sequels, but this incarnation was vastly different and for those who have seen the originals, interesting, at least.  The crew is back, with slight alterations due to the change in time that took place in movie 1.  Same banter and interaction, same camera jerkiness when the Enterprise is using weapons, and same extreme vagueness as to how warp drive seemingly gets you from point A to point B in less than 90 seconds now.  Scotty takes a bigger and funnier roll (welcomed).<br /><br />Best Trek ever?  No.  Worth seeing?  Yes.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|To be honest at first I wasn't for sure about the book. But, the more I read the more I got into it. And before I knew it I was up all night waiting to see what happened next. That is a sign of a good story. I'm hoping for a sequel.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's awesome and I don't want to put it down. If there are any battle lovers out there this game is for you.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Easily digested. I loved the way death narates the story--this is an unusual twist.<br />Iloved the way it talks about a German girl as being a victim of the war, often not something considered in other books.<br />Very memorable and thought provoking. I longed to pick it up again and again.
006097625X|5.0|While the description \\"a comic book about comic books\\" may sound a bit gimmicky, once you read a few pages you'll see why this is a masterwork that could not have been written any other way. McCloud deftly uses the form of comics to probe the medium itself and why we respond to it so strongly.
B004Q3UL2O|2.0|If it were not for the actors, this film would have been a bust.  Speaking of bust, you get to see a lot of nudity that I don't believe adds to the movie.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|The movie that started it all. The movie that started the trilogy. The movie that got me to check and see if I could catch my toys coming to life.
B0032U45JW|5.0|Rent is my favorite musical that is a movie! I like the songs and cast! It is a little long, but it does not seem like it as you are viewing the movie.
140006922X|4.0|Great reading. As a religion scholar I found that the book, although written by someone of a different religion,offered a great scholarly writing.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I have this book at my school and I have to read it because I do not have the book at home.
B00CSJYYO4|5.0|Muy buen libro, te hace recordar q todo fue hecho x una misma mano, y ese amor q tu buscas esta en tu corazón. Aprende a escucharlo..
B00E03ULJS|5.0|This CD was better than I thought it was going to be. I like Krewella even more now after listening to the whole CD! There are only a couple of songs that I might not listen to often, but otherwise the rest of the songs are awesome!
B00FEN1C50|4.0|Fun movie with all the battle Royale movrs you've always wanted from a monster versus robot since you were a kid. Excellent effects.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i gave it 5 stars because i love this show,my whole familly sits together and watches it,i would tell everyone about this show.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|SG:U was one of the most promising shows on SyFy. But as all quality scifi content the bean counters don't understand it or how scifi fans consume content, so great shows get canceled. The HD package is impressive.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Great book. This series is amazing so far, and I can't wait until The One comes out in May 2014
B009LDD5HW|5.0|I enjoy so much watching Glee. I really enjoy the show. I used to watch it on tv, but I do not have time anymore, so I bought it
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Great book.  Why do I need to review something to rate it?  Thanks for the help Amazon.  And I have to write so much, great....
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Obviously, I'm in the minority here.  I really had intentions of enjoying this movie but that just didn't happen.  The scenes seem to be way longer than necessary, and the story line just seemed to drag on and on and on (zzzzzzz).  I'm sure much of this could have been shortened to a more tolerable level.  After all, how long is a childs attention span?  Certainly not what I expected after seeing so many good reviews for this \\"epic\\" movie.  To me, this seemed to be an effort on rewriting the book and then failing in the attempt.  After an hour of wasted time I just couldn't take it any more and tapped.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is absolutely one of my favorites, and is a timeless classic. On top of that, it's kind of awesome that there is a free virtual version here, for people without an actual copy. I'd recommend it to ANYONE, even if it's not for a school asignment, but this free kindle version makes it very easy to get your hands on it in a short amount of time for school.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Asian takes a subject that has the potential to be a real snoozer and brings it to like in a complelling and exciting way.  I was shocked when I came to the end... I thougjht there was more... I wanted more! But he has so many references that a good part of the book is taken up with the facts he draws from.  A compelling and informative book.  A warning though, Bible quoters won't want to hear anything about it.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|I do like all the tricks but the whole thing is different.  And on this on e, no Darth Vader when you lose.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|so much nicer to use than the stock Android app, and it's free what could be better? three more words
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Liane Moriarty has a sense of humor and a take on women that delights me.  I keep telling people the plot line as if these were all fridnds of mine.  An excellent read with wonderful twists and turns.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Not good. Stole slow-motion stuff from Sam Peckinpah, and the most of the movie doesn't make sense as there is no plot development other than the expected violent scene leading to another violent scene. I know why Karl Urban kept that stupid helmet on the entire movie. He didn't want to be seen playing such a bad part.
1478952733|5.0|I passed the Metropolitan Museum of Art the other day and was struck with a powerful and initially inexplicable melancholy. I had been affected by the experience of reading The Goldfinch, in the opening chapters of which a great tragedy happens there. The book is compelling and moving. Tartt is a master of foreshadowing, letting us know just enough of what is to come that we feel helpless to put down the book. I found myself staying up late for several nights, turning page after page to connect the dots. This book is every bit the equal of [[ASIN:1400031702 The Secret History]] in this regard. And it exceeds that earlier book in its great emotional depth. The opening section, in New York City, is terribly sad and in the hands of a lesser author this material would be difficult to get past. However, Tartt has signaled us well enough about the future of our protagonist, Theodore Dekker, that we stick with him. And from the second section of the book, while we have no shortage of continuing misery, it is tempered by hope or humor.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is necessarily realistic; it is structurally a Bildungsroman, and it constantly evokes earlier books rather than real life.  In the opening section, when Theo is still living in New York City, I particularly detected [[ASIN:0316769487 The Catcher in the Rye]]. When he moves in with the family of a wealthy school friend, his hope of being adopted by them evokes elements of [[ASIN:0486415864 Great Expectations]], a book that is recalled again when he returns to them over a decade later to find the matron of the family shut away like Miss Havisham (though for very different reasons). He is taken away to Las Vegas and falls in with a bad crowd, evoking [[ASIN:0486424537 Oliver Twist]]. As in that book, the reader understands that some of this crowd provide necessary support for the young man. Theo returns to New York and, years later, finds himself exploring dark places with Boris, his criminally inclined Las Vegas friend, following the trail of a missing painting. This reminded me of the best work of [[ASIN:0140121552 Stephen Dobyns]]. Some parts of the book even recall [[ASIN:0679722645 The Maltese Falcon]], though the book treats its namesake artwork as more than merely a MacGuffin. Others will find different precedents, I'm sure. This book is long and rich.<br /><br />Tartt took over a decade to write The Goldfinch, and polished its language over that time. In Las Vegas, for example, Theo describes his new quarters as \\"the kind of room where a call girl or stewardess would be murdered on television.\\" Tartt has so much fun with the speaking cadence of drunk Russians (or Ukranians), I have to imagine she spends a fair amount of time with Slavs. Dialect humor is rare nowadays, but here it is done with such love that it's inoffensive and often quite funny.<br /><br />I've not spent time in the failed housing developments at the extremes of Las Vegas, nor with Ukrainian drug dealers, but Tartt portrays these worlds so vividly I don't doubt her depictions of them at all. The quality of the plotting, the characterizations, and the dialog in this book are consistently excellent. As Stephen King wrote of The Goldfinch in the New York Times Book Review, \\"You keep waiting for the wheels to fall off, but . . . they never do.\\"<br /><br />What's not so perfect? Though Tartt captures the subtleties of several different kinds of relationships between men, much better than I would have thought possible for a female author, the relationships between Theo Dekker and women never quite ring true. One may give the excuse that Theo is so damaged by the loss of his mother that he is never again capable of normal relationships with the opposite sex, but I think this explanation takes one only so far.<br /><br />The passages in which Theo crams for university entrance exams seem hard to believe and, oddly for a tome like this, rushed.<br /><br />Finally, and this is not Tartt's fault,I'm sure, the paper in the hardcover edition is too thin. I suspect the publisher winced at receiving an 800 page manuscript and decided to print on thin paper in the hope of creating a less intimidating volume on bookstore shelves. When reading page 403, you have to ignore the backwards shadow of the words on page 404, overleaf.<br /><br />Tartt tackles broad themes in this book: to what degree can we control our fate? Or does life unspool in response only to forces beyond our control, including randomness? These are common enough topics for novelists, and I found myself dwelling particularly on some of the book's secondary themes, as they are less commonly discussed. Can humans create objects that have souls, and what obligation do we have to our creations, and is there any meaningful way in which artifacts make life worth living? What is the significance of authenticity, and can a copy ever be as significant as the original? Can we be moved sometimes by the absence of something as much as we would have been by its presence? In a profile of Tartt on October 21, the New York Times said that this book raises such questions as \\"whether it is possible to be good, what part love plays in our behavior and what in life is true and lasting.\\"<br /><br />It's a wonderful book, worth every penny and every hour needed to read it.I'm sure, the paper in the hardcover edition is too thin.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I so enjoyed this book- I would have given it 5 stars except I was so disappointed when it ended.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|Kids have really enjoyed the characters and songs. Very engaging. Sounds cheesy, but the 'happy feet' makes them want to dance more so than other Disney/Pixar movies.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Like most books of this type (self help, spirituality, new age) it has more words than necessary to convey the subjects.  But the subjects are great.  I  have gotten a lot from this book and I bought it a second time (after many years) to have it on Kindle format.  I would highly recommend it to those &#34;on the path&#34;.
1936608898|5.0|I am really enjoying &#34;It Starts with Food.&#34; In clear, understandable language, the authors teach healthy nutrition and the science behind it.  This book really calls for a decision, a commitment, to healthy eating as an important lifestyle choice. I highly recommend this book, especially to people I love and care about.
B00D9PUXQY|4.0|There is no pretense with Devildriver. They are a straight up, honest, grooving, modern metal band. Live, they are a phenomenal force.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, this album is a great progression in terms of the band's sound. It feels like the logical next step to Beast, and in particular the 'Dead to Rights' side/style of Beast.<br /><br />At times, though, I would like a little more 'space' for songs to breathe. I love Dez's lyrics, style and delivery. I just feel like the vocal lines are suffocating the songs a little.<br /><br />There isn't the same kind of space and groove here as on &#34;Last Kind Words&#34;, but then there wasn't on &#34;Beast&#34; either. And then, &#34;Pray For Villains&#34; was something different again - personally I think &#34;Waiting for November&#34; is one of their most heartfelt and underrated songs.<br /><br />But, I would still recommend buying this album. Get into Devildriver! All up, an underrated band and a brutal, brutal album you'll return to many times.
B000000OU6|1.0|Good guitar ...STINK vocal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! don't waist your money. The singer should be shot.Do not buy this disc, it sucks big time. Hear it once ,throw it away.....
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This blew my mind. Best book ever when it comes to get me going. This is how I learn. This is who I am.
B00CEJ2EKE|5.0|If you are complaining about this album after buying it, perhaps you haven't done your own research. Amon Amarth are not a prog band, a thrash band or anything else; they are a viking metal death 'n' roll type metal band. They don't stray from that tried and tested format. And for good reason: they are really, really good at it.<br /><br />&#34;Blood Eagle&#34; is my favourite track but the album is a ripper.<br /><br />Buy it! Support these guys. They deserve some of your hard earned after 20 years.
0439023491|5.0|I took the audiobook out from the library and my children happened to listen in.  They have been hooked ever since.  Now I will probably have to wait in bad weather to catch the midnight premiere of the movie version of this book:-(...Just kidding, I like it too.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|There is a generous little pile of cocaine on the cover of \\"Get Clean\\" and it sucks you straight into a story you know is written from experience and from the heart.<br /><br />\\"Get Clean\\" is laugh out loud funny as Jimmy Walker realizes he is slipping into addiction. He escapes grey fey England for Marbella without realizing that on what's called the Costa del Crime the young and well-heeled are snorting back lines of coke almost as often as they draw breath.<br /><br />It's fun. Until it isn't. That's when the laughter dies in your throat. The intriguing-named author Jams N. Roses turns out the lights and takes us on a journey into the dark side of crime, violence and cold steel fear as he discovers his sidekick, Jason, isn't just out of control, he's a psychopath. Well-written, fast-paced, I read this book through in one sitting.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|This is a tremendous piece of research based film work. Such a great testament to the artistic form we all think we know so well.<br /><br />The care and detail that has gone into this is evident upon first watching it. By the end of the epic series you'll be full of excellent information.<br /><br />Cannot recommend it highly enough.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|This book is a great read.  Rose is such a lovably naive character, it just made me want every possible happy ending for her.  Some of the wishes on Roses' list were just heartbreaking, but it just made me root for her more.  I will definitely read the rest of the series and look for more from this author.
B00CY5Y3A2|5.0|1987's Heaven On Earth is my all time favorite Belinda Carlisle album. I am so happy with the 3 DISC re-issue. Disc 1 has the remastered album and single edits as well. Disc 2 cool remixes. Disc 3-the main reason I purchased all 4 re-issues-THE DVD- I finally own the 3 classic videos from the album on dvd. Heaven Is A Place On Earth, I Get Weak and my favorite of all of Belinda's videos Circle In The Sand. And the 1988 concert Belinda LIVE! is included on the 3rd disc(I had the vhs copy bought in 1988) along with the 3 videos, a Belinda interview discussing the album and LIVE videos. The dvd plays in US dvd /blu-ray players. NTSC. Love the booklet with photos from 1987/1988. I am really happy with the quality and care that went into these albums.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Lincoln is one of my greatest heroes, not only because he was such a strong president, but because of his mental illness and courage in the face of profound loss.  I too suffer from chronic depression, and he was absolutely amazing in what he did as an individual and the legacy he left us a nation.  The script and the acting is brilliant and you will truly feel that you know Lincoln after watching this movie.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|This movie is about two boys who find a fugitive, who is basically a good man, and try to help him escape the law.  They are helping him build a boat to escape the island where he is hiding.  They have to scavenge parts, much like building ET's communication device to &#34;phone home.&#34;<br /><br />Action and suspense, two great child actors, and Matthew McConaughey's charm combine to create a fantastic movie!
B0012NVGHU|4.0|It seemed like real life, ending happily and sadly, but ending feeling worth it.  No attempt at adding false drama or false successes to real life.  Sound quality kept it from being 5 stars.
B00003CXCQ|3.0|I have not as yet viewed this video because they are to be given as Christmas gift for my granddaughters.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is my favorite all time Christmas movie of all time! I had a copy of it, but when we moved, it some how got lost. While on maternity leave last Christmas, my husband ordered this movie for me, because he knows how much I love it and how upset I was when I lost my first copy. Totally made my Christmas last year!
B006MVJ2L4|3.0|This sounds much like his first album.  It is okay, but didn't make me want to listen to it over and over.
1451639155|5.0|I do hope there is a continuation of Ivan & Tej's adventures and life story.  This book was entirely different than those about \\"Miles\\", yet somehow familiar.  It includes many of our favorite \\"characters\\" and environment.  The story was so engrossing, well written and entertaining that I devoured it in a mere three days.  This, while ignoring my regular chores with \\"I can do it later, I have to see what happens next\\".<br /><br />Well done, Ms. Bujold.
B0032W5H9C|5.0|What do you do if you are 16, an only child whose parents smother you, and you long for the sophisticated, expansive world beyond your school gates? You accept a ride, and relationship, with an older man when he makes an appearance. It's the 1960's and Jenny's (Carey Mulligan) trajectory is leading towards Oxford. Until David (Peter Saargard), twice her age, interrupts it. After accepting a ride home with him, he charms her parents into letting him take her to concerts and dinners and even trips. He has sophisticated and elegant friends who talk about subjects beyond A-levels.<br /><br />There's something slightly \\"off\\" about David, but Jenny and her parents can't quite see it. Jenny's father (Alfred Molina) is the perfect bumpkin foil to David's smooth sophistication. David chats them up, and seduces them as well. He seduces the audience too - we would be tempted to go for a ride with him, so understand Jenny and her parents' capitulation. Where will this all end?<br /><br />In 'an education' of course. In more ways than one. Jenny learns about the world and wiles. Normally a movie like this would end rather darkly, and you would ponder how another young life was ruined by exploitation. But I loved the ending in this movie, based upon a real life story by Lynn Barber, in which Jenny gets a second chance. A stern but temperate headmistress (played fantastically by Emma Thompson) and a sympathetic teacher Miss Stubbs (Olivia Williams) craft a different kind of education for her.<br /><br />Did life end happily for Lynn Barber? She says of her experience in THE GUARDIAN: \\"What did I get from Simon (aka David in the film)? An education - the thing my parents always wanted me to have. I learned a lot in my two years with Simon. I learned about expensive restaurants and luxury hotels and foreign travel, I learned about antiques and Bergman films and classical music. All this was useful when I went to Oxford - I could read a menu, I could recognise a fingerbowl, I could follow an opera, I was not a complete hick. But actually there was a much bigger bonus than that. My experience with Simon entirely cured my craving for sophistication. By the time I got to Oxford, I wanted nothing more than to meet kind, decent, straightforward boys my own age, no matter if they were gauche or virgins. I would marry one eventually and stay married all my life and for that, I suppose, I have Simon to thank.<br /><br />But there were other lessons Simon taught me that I regret learning. I learned not to trust people; I learned not to believe what they say but to watch what they do; I learned to suspect that anyone and everyone is capable of \\"living a lie\\". I came to believe that other people - even when you think you know them well - are ultimately unknowable. Learning all this was a good basis for my subsequent career as an interviewer, but not, I think, for life. It made me too wary, too cautious, too ungiving. I was damaged by my education.\\"<br /><br />Most of us have been taken in by unscrupulous folks sometime in our life and have to get 'an education' in being wary, cautious and a tad ungiving. Maybe it leaves more emotional scars when you are 16 instead of 26. This film captures the euphoria and misery of an education like this. It demonstrates that what begins wrongly, doesn't end well. It's a cautionary tale.ollow an opera, I was not a complete hick. But actually there was a much bigger bonus than that. My experience with Simon entirely cured my craving for sophistication.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|First things first.  I would take a \\"Walking Dead\\" zombie any day of the week over one of the zombies in this movie.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, picture \\"Infected Kenyans\\" and you will have some sort of idea as to what these guys are up against.<br />Overall, the movie was suspenseful and worth watching.  Good twists, but not really anything extremely new.  It's a good one-time flick...maybe twice if you're seeing it with someone who hasn't seen it before.  Check it out if you haven't yet.

Having the app on my device saves me from having to go onto the browser to bring up the maps.  It's great if you are travelling as it quickly identifies travel routes to hotels and restaurants and the time it will take to get there.  Also you are often offered a choice in the route as well.

B005LAIIN0|3.0|I anticiapted this movie for a few months assuming with Brad Pit as the leading man it would be a decent show, especially since its a Zombie flick.. *********MILD SPOILERS******** This movie starts quick and is fairly smart, It breaks from the normal mold of zombie flicks, and thats a nice change.. Brad pit is smart and measured in most everything he does, its clear he's a thinker just as soon as this show gets going it gets into a fairly smooth progression, I liked that. If your looking for a gore fest look elsewhere as this movie spends more time on suspence and story telling and alot less time on Zombies and gore. The story brought me in, hooked me, took me for a pleasnt mystery suspence ride.. and then towards the end it fizzles..  I get what scenes in the movie are suppose to be the climactic ending but i feel like they are a letdown. The ending in general was a letdown. Mind you im not saying it was a bad movie and if we could do halves i would have rated it at 3.5 However we can,t and i dont feel this movie deserves a 4 star rating.  The previews are deceptive and thats onother one of my gripes..<br /><br />This movie felt a lot like \\"ARGO\\" only a zombie flick..  it was never very exciting,however it wasnt boring.. i think it did ok up till the last 15 minutes then it just fizzled..
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|A movie when you see the second time make it even better -  wonderful story line - great twists & turns.  Highly entertaining and worth the time to turn off the world for awhile.<br /><br />MUST SEE again and again

B009LDD1X0|3.0|I LOVED the first two seasons of TBBT. Season three was OK. Season four started great and then took a really bad turn when they turned Amy into a Penny worshiping sex crazed groupie. They also dumbed down the show a lot after that. They've destroyed Leonards character with the Penny relationship. He should be with someone smart like Alex,or Priya, not a dumb bimbo blonde with way too much attitude who believes in psychics and gets mad when he points out to her that all psychics are frauds. Season six was better than season five but the show has lost it's direction. I like the additions of Bernadette and Amy, I just wish they were allowed to be the smart women they are supposed to be. Raj's character has also taken a turn for the worse. They feminized him and made him way too pathetic. The only character they have developed well is Howard. Bring the science back and fix the theme song, the Big Bang did not happen fourteen million years ago it was fourteen billion years ago.

Nothing offensive (except we don't like to say \\"that sucks\\" -- and the dad says \\"sucky\\" which I didn't like...but that's being extremely picky).  It was entertaining, but I found that we all laughed more at this movie than we had in a long time.  It was highly amusing.  Highly recommended.

It is all a matter of taking a different more involved and intentional view of how to live ones life.<br /><br />This book is really only valuable to those who are ready and willing to challenge existing beliefs about their own strengths and resources for enjoying their show (life).<br /><br />I salute those who get even a small part of what she shared.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is the best app that you can get in store it has everything: math science biology economics games, anything you want to know just ask it to Wolframalpha
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. It's easy and challenging at the same time - once I get started, I can't put it down.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I did not find it as Plug n play as advertised.  Set up is reasonably simple, but the USB needs a power source and micro cable AC adapter (now I have even more plugs in the AV system).  It also took awhile to get Chrome browser updates and app downloads to work.<br />Not surprisingly, Google services like YouTube work fine (but they work on my AppleTV too.  It does replicate any browsing on the Chrome browser, but several streaming websites are not fully supported, such as Amazon on Demand and any Silverlight streaming service.  There is a work around, but the volume won't go through.<br />It's inexpensive, that much is true.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I searched high and low for a free audio dictionary and found this to be the easiest dictionary to use with clear audio.  The extras such as word usage is excellent.  Farlex teases the user with bonus word games and education as well.  Related references to websites are easily useful links.  I give it my highest recommendation without reservation.  I am sure you will enjoy your continued everyday learning as well.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Seems pretty fun so far. Expect things will continue to become more challenging as I gain new levels. Still a free game so far.
B0052FG750|5.0|Having grown up in the 60s, the music of The Doors served as part of the \\"soundtrack\\" of my youth. At some point I had all these albums, but not always in the same format...(e.g. \\"Soft Parade\\" & \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" on cassette, \\"The Doors\\" on 8-Track, \\"LA Woman\\", \\"Strange Days\\" and \\"Morrison Hotel\\" on vinyl). Of course I also had some of the compilations (e.g \\"Wierd Scenes Inside the Gold Mine\\" and \\"The Best of the Doors\\" on cassette)<br /><br />I had a pretty good idea of what was going on with this music when it was released and I pretty much know all the lyrics by heart so I just wanted the music as it was released, I am not really interested in liner notes and the fluff and alternate takes that are normally associated with 'box sets'. Besides, after working on and flying helicopters for the better part of my adult life (over 30 years), my hearing isn't what it used to be so I am not going to notice some of the subtleties of other box sets that have been \\"remixed\\",\\"remastered\\", or \\"rehashed\\". All I know is that they sound great through my Bose 901s. End result? This collection is perfect for me.<br /><br />At $30 this is as good as finding all six of these albums in the $5.00 bargain bin at WalMart
B00CA4S27W|3.0|I love Blackmore's Night. I have all of the individual albums. This one I could do without though. There wasn't any track that really caught my fancy. I'd pass on this one.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this series to death it's full of so many twists and turns I've read this so many times I could memorize every word.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I got into this series by watching the first few episodes on tv, but knowing that the books are usually better than the screen versions I decided to buy this series and was not disappointed. I got the kindle version (I got a great deal on the price for this set) despite the many complaints and have no problems with it. I can see exactly where I am by the little dots on the bottom if you know what I mean. It is easy to navigate between the books and find the maps, but they are small and hard to read so I just look at one of the many great maps available online if I want more detail. This is a wonderful fantasy story with many twists and surprises, good character and plot development (there are a lot of characters) and pleasurable to read. What more could you want in a good book?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so AWESOME ,GREAT, AMAZING ,BEST ,NUMBER ONE LOVELY FAST AWESOME BEST IN AMERICA ,DESERVES 100 STARS IN rates.
B000FBJG04|5.0|A remarkably true story of a time and place in history where a group of individuals, molded like coal under pressure, became the diamond of combat units with their friendship and interpersonal bonds of trust being their singularity.

B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I got this app at the end of 8th grade (I think) and never used it.lately I have decided I wanted to get stronger and healthier and be able to complete my gym teachers warm-up.I have used this app for only 2 days in a row and I love that it offers coupons as a reward for completing the exercise,which also helps because I bring my lunch from home so I can see (and my mom can save money) what is healthy to eat.
B003V1WUKS|3.0|I get the feeling that Franco's literary influences are about the same as those of the author Luke Hartwell, but whereas Hartwell does extraordinarily original things in his fiction, Franco does seem like a copycat, as other reviewers have said. I wish I could talk to Franco and suggest he read Hartwell's Atom Heart John Beloved. I think it would help him see where he could be better. I did enjoy the varying first person points of view. That is hard to pull off. Faulkner did it, but, um, the comparison between those two ends there. It's okay. I doubt if it would have been published if he wasn't James Franco, but obviously a lot of his fans are enjoying reading his stuff, so I do admire him for putting himself out there and taking the criticism he must have known would come.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game! I love strategy games and this is one of the best. It's got a great storyline that keeps me coming back.
B00E1ZIZ3O|5.0|This album is a sort of repaying of the compliment by many of the artists whose songs Peter Gabriel covered on his Scratch My Back album in 2010. Whatever you thought of that album (I wasn't all that keen) I'd suggest giving this a try. It's very well worth hearing and there's some great stuff on it.<br /><br />I really like hearing other takes on familiar Peter Gabriel songs, partly because they are so familiar and a new version really makes me listen to what the song is about again. There are also some genuinely excellent performances here, although which ones you think they are will probably depend on your personal taste. For me, the distinctively Bon Iver version of Come Talk To Me, Paul Simon's largely acoustic Biko and David Byrne being David Byrne in I Don't Recall stand out, and both Arcade Fire and Elbow surprised me by producing really good versions of Games Without Frontiers and Mercy Street respectively. You may disagree with all of that, of course. Similary, lots of listeners will probably love Lou Reed's version of Solsbury Hill, whereas I think he utterly murders a beautiful song which has meant a lot to me for three decades and more. You'll have to form your own judgement.<br /><br />It's hard to give an overall rating, but there's a lot of really first-rate stuff here and I've given it five stars on that basis. I would urge any Peter Gabriel fan to try this. You'll probably love some tracks and dislike others, but I reckon it's well worth a try and there are a lot of tracks here that I will be playing for years to come, I suspect. Warmly recommended.<br /><br />(By the way, this is also packaged with Scratch My Back in a very reasonably-priced double CD if you don't already have it [[ASIN:B00E1ZIZ6G Scratch My Back/And...(Ltd.Edt.)]] )

B000I3UMKM|5.0|Wonderful classic love story in the early 60's New York City.  Beautiful music complements the beauty of both Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard.  Had been waiting for this one to hit \\"prime\\" for awhile.  Thank you for letting us watch it.  Amazon is fantastic.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I start reading The Racketeer during my open house slow real estate traffic. Time to end the open house arrived and it become a turning page with so many thrills and surprises. I couldn't stop reading and I overstay the open house closing time. Well it was a blessing for me because at the very end a buyer walk in and bought the house.<br /><br />I recommended to my husband and he is reading but he is not too excited. I guess different tastes. The last fifty pages were okay and predictable but not as excited as the first 100 pages. Overall very good!

And more: \\"Lover\\" should Number One-Hit! If ...<br /><br />This band will be one of the  most influential bands since \\"The Who\\", \\"Led Zep\\" and \\"Queen w. Freddie Mercury\\"! There's more to come, for sure ...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never liked a book so much that I wanted to support a new unknown author in hopes that he/she will succeed in making many more. Spoiler Alert: I almost put this book down because the author wrote a story that quickly sucked me in and gave me a love for the main character, causing me to yearn for them to overcome and triumph.... but then he killed them off. TWICE!!  Luckily he was only setting up the backdrop of a marvelously believable tale that I just couldn't put down. (Main character remains through to end.)<br /><br /> I have purchased the sequel only after five minutes of finishing this one. Why five minutes? I needed a bathroom break.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I started collecting his CD's recently and now I'm a huge fan!  I love that he can go from ballad to blues to any other style seamlessly!

B000W4E3OS|4.0|Three years ago, in reviewing Bernd Glemser playing Scriabin Piano Sonatas Vol. 1 ([[ASIN:B00000145B Scriabin: Piano Sonatas, Vol. 1 - Nos. 2, 5, 6, 7, & 9 / Fantasy in B minor]]), I wrote of the music's endless fascination. Here is fascination revisited on a vast scale. In this 8-disc compilation of Scriabin's complete solo piano works having opus numbers, Maria Lettberg effects classy performances as she lets Scriabin woo, dazzle or hold listeners rapt with his now sensuous, now edgy music.  The allocation of works on the discs is by type: Sonatas (two CDs), Préludes (two), Études (one), Mazurkas / Valses (one), Impromptus / Poèmes (one), and Miscellaneous Works (one). The compositions on each disc are arranged chronologically, providing a wonderful opportunity to follow Scriabin's changing style from the earliest pieces in the late 1880's through to the latest in 1914.  Lettberg had to come to terms not only with the evolving style but also the sheer number and variety of the works, calling for adaptability and versatility equal to the task. To mention a few things I've noted: She plays the last movement of Sonata No. 1 (Funebre) with aplomb. Her traversal of Sonata No. 2 is beautifully fluid; the Andante of Sonata No. 3, a model of tranquility. Sonata No. 6 would be high on any shortlist of the best works of this set that I may care to draw up; after a start typical of the composer's distinctive late style, she attains that sinister aura that made Scriabin shrink from playing the sonata in public. The Préludes can be addictive - the totally relaxed way she plays op. 16 no. 3 made me listen to it repeatedly; it's a marvel of simplicity concealing high art. Études op. 65 nos. 1 and 2 exude a brightness reminiscent of Sonata no. 7 (though compositionally different, the late works have a recognizable stylistic resemblance), as Lettberg plays them with easy elegance. Yet to suggest that she is always as relaxed would be to miss the point - she gives each piece its due, and when called for can play with intensity, taking good advantage of the rich bass sonorities of her piano to add clout to the performances. And for crisp articulation and crystal clarity of tone I find in Poème-Nocturne op. 61 a fine example.  I have listened to all eight CDs more than once and can cite personal favorites from each one. But the sum of it is that Maria Lettberg may best be described as a versatile interpreter, admirably consistent in playing well a multitude of varied, often difficult works.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|It's satisfing to use effective tools.  The Lansky system is best for maintaining knives. I carry a Leatherman pocket tool that I use frequently and in the kitchen we have high quality knives that I keep sharp. The key to sharpness is holding the correct angle for the hardness of the steel and the use of the blade.  The Lansky system guides the hone at the desired angle(s), resulting in a clean, perfect edge.  The downside is that even with a coarse hone, it takes a while to restore badly neglected knives.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I gave it a just OK rating because, though interesting, the characters are so warped it was hard to like either of them and therefore there is no mental cheering for either of the main characters to &#34;win&#34; in the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great if you want to turn you dumb tv into a &#34;basic&#34; smart tv.  Google is adding functionality all the time! Excited to see additional functionality for such an inexpensive device!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|DOES NOT OPEN AT ALL! I am so tired of the FB updates, they never work right. Ugh. Fix it!
B004V9MU86|5.0|A book that should be read by everyone. Gut wrenching story but well written and had some humour and plenty of heart breaking moments. Should be read so we never forget what happened!
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Weird but interesting. It had us talking for a couple of days about the plot and characters. I've not read the book so can not compare but the plot had many holes that should have been tied up a little neater.
B0055N0FZM|4.0|This was one of those books that everyone should read. I felt quite overwhelmed at times with the diary entries, and could only barely comprehend the enormity of being hidden in an annex for 2 years!
B001BANK32|5.0|Loved every minute of this book.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good scare. Can't wait to get started on Dr Sleep
B008B1BL4E|5.0|For a non expert on the subject like myself, this book explains the intricacies of WW! in a clear, multi perspective way. Highly recommendable.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|What can I say?  I was hooked within the first 5 minutes!  I am addicted to this show and thank God it's on Prime because I can just watch the episodes continuously like it's one really long movie.  Great characters, excellent acting.  Drama, comedy, suspense, this show has everything you could want (except maybe explosions and cgi, but that doesn't make it any less awesome!).
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|its help up well to my everyday use.  the inside cleans the screen when closed.  thin and good looking for professional use.  the red interior also gets some positive attention. its not an otter box, but im not a navy seal either.  so far ive had good luck with it.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Up until a few months ago I had only ever heard OF Joe Bonamassa but never heard anything he'd done. So during a discussion with a friend of mine about favourite guitarists and music in general Bonamassa came up and he lent me this DVD to peruse.  Initially superlatives actually failed me, I was totally blown away by what I saw and heard so much so that I immediately ordered both the DVD and the CD, to me, it WAS that good and, to quote another musical friend of mine I think Joe could get a tune out of a wet sack!! and make it sound incredible. Thoroughly recommend this to anyone interested in technically brilliant playing with bucket loads of feeling thrown in.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|There is some entertainment value, the movie isn't all bad. Very violent, bloody, lots of agonizing screaming and moaning. I wouldn't recommend it.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|The songs are fun and inspiring! Any age can listen to this. The thing that really made me buy this is that Owlcity is one of the only bands that could put my 4 month old sister to sleep. She loves him :) As do I.
0547258305|5.0|Originally published on my blog (reader.christiney.com)<br /><br />Title: Graceling<br />Series: Graceling Realm, Book 1<br />Author: Kristin Cashore<br />Rating: 5 Stars<br /><br /> It is really rare for me to find a book that I completely love, but GRACELING was one of those books. After reading it, I could not open another book for days (or work on my own stories) because I wanted a part of me to stay in that world for as long as possible.<br /><br />Nowadays, it seems like the trend for YA is a kick-ass, strong heroine and, while I love strong female role models, it seems as though the authors often overdo it to the point where the female protagonists often reads like a stereotype. The worst part is when the heroines fall in love and lose some of the qualities that I loved.<br /><br />THE STORY (From GR)<br /><br />In the Seven Kingdoms, people born with an extreme skill, \\"Grace\\", are feared and exploited. Katsa herself despises hers, killing. Her uncle Randa, King of the Middluns, commands her to punish and torture his enemies. Prince Po, with combat skills, becomes her friend, and she learns terrible truths about her Grace and a secret hidden far away that could destroy the realm.<br /><br />WHAT I LOVED<br /><br />OMG. The premise. I loved the premise about how different-colored eyes are graced with a special skill and I especially love how Katsa is graced with a gift that she never wants. After I read this, I think I went and stalked some people I know with different-colored eyes just so I could gaze into them...<br /><br />Another thing I loved was the relationship between Katsa and Po. It seemed more realistic than most of the other relationships I read in stories (instantaneous love at first sight... really people?) and I love how it slowly builds from companionship to friendship to genuine love. Also, there was this one scene that was more erotic than any love scene I've ever read in YA books (instantaneous love that can be soothed with just a kiss... REALLY PEOPLE?).<br /><br />I also love the twist about her abilities and also love how Katsa grows as a person. Unlike other books where the shift is apparent (usually after that *one* conflict), Katsa grows throughout the entire novel and the reader isn't able to realize it until the very end when we're reflecting on the story we just read. That is how we, as people, grow and I love how she was able to accurately portray that transformation on paper.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE<br /><br />Although a majority of her characters were well fleshed-out, I felt as though some of the characters were thrown in at the last minute to give Katsa a push plot-wise. For example, the captain. While reading, I thought the captain would get more mentions in the story (especially after she realized that the captain didn't need to stay in sea) but, sadly, that wasn't the case.<br /><br />Also, the mountain scene. I felt as though that was the weakest part in the novel but every book does have its flaw.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />GRACELING may seem like a typical fantasy and, to some degree, it is. But, Cashore's writing is very fresh and the pacing was well-done thus it seemed as though I was never struggling to read any part of the story. In fact, I devoured it in one sitting.<br /><br />I know that this is the first book in a series, but the series isn't like a typical series but, rather, like a grouping of stories told in the same world. Which does have its pros and cons.<br /><br />Pro: I thought the book ended at a great point and loved how it was written to be a standalone. In fact, I love how she decided not to monetize on Katsa's story by writing another book about her but on the other characters in the Graceling world. This way, the readers are able to learn more about the world.<br /><br />Con: I want to discover what happens between Katsa and Po!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />In short, great book. Will recommend it to anyone, but I do suggest that parents be wary when buying itfor their younger children.for their younger children.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first began reading the Hunger Games.  At the end, I find myself not only pleased at finding such a good story, but also moved by the real life comparisons to the world as I know it found in this book. This story may be a futuristic tale, however the present day implications about human nature should not be ignored.  I would recommend this trilogy to all.
0307895505|5.0|It did meet my standards thanks again for sending it to me with more information i needed on the game
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I really like the book but had to modify the plan. I'm a workout at home guy & don't have a workout partner so I have to be more careful with the heavy lifting. I don't increase weight as often or as much so gains are slower & takes more patience. Also, I don't have the equipment called for with some of the exercises so I have to find suitable substitutes and/or improvise.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie! It sure keeps you guessing. Wonderful acting and great story line. I would definitely recommend watching this! :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Laugh with the situation.  Get caught up in the attraction.  Feel the heartbreak.  Smile with the persistence.  A little of everything...a fun read.
B005USZML4|5.0|I liked the book a lot. Edge of seat read. Everyone should read this great book. Ages 8 and up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and addictive is what the writeup says. This game is all that and more. I highly recommend it for an imaginative challenge.
B005USZYDU|5.0|It was a great book especially if you are looking for a mystery.  I recommend this book because it unfolds then you get to read the second book.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Best writing I 've had the pleasure of coming across in a Long Time.  Great story line.  Well developed. ONE must read through the second third as characters become entangled. Writer was masterful bringing events, characters & timing together.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Phantom...Les Mis...does it get any better? I had to get the Blu-Ray version of this movie. Emmy Rossem's voice is pure gold and paired with Gerard Butler...well, it just doesn't get any better. Highly Recommend this movie!
B004XDYJRU|3.0|The TuneIn Radio Pro is okay but confusing to use when on the go. I strongly recommend to simplify its usage. It is okay but not friendly.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Mis or Phantom....Phantom or Les Mis...I can't decide which is my favorite! The story line in Les Mis is so powerful and the songs will tug on your heart. There are a few somewhat weak singers in the group...but this is not live theatre! This is a movie about a wonderful, compelling story and I think all of the actors brought power and passion to this movie. I highly recommend this movie!
0553381407|5.0|I really didn't understand what drove my wife until I read this.  It goes into depth about the damage parents do and how to deal with it.
B00006D295|5.0|If you have never seen it, then you wont understand the cult following...this was a &#34;standard&#34; for the midnight movies of the 70's
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Can't stop watching it!!  This is one of the best tv shows ever.  It's has excitement, intensity, and some tearful moments!  I give the cast and script, 2 thumbs up!!!  Wish I could give it an extra star!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My wife and I rented this from a vending machine, a bit skeptically. It was hilarious though, and we bought it here on Amazon right after we watched it. I wish there were more behind the scenes type special features, but still a great buy. We have since watched it four more times, which is highly unusual for us. A bit crude in places, unfortunately (the vomiting, for example). I look forward to the sequel, as long as all the main characters return.
B0052YAKS6|4.0|Really love Sia, Jennifer Hudson and Usher. Great CD to roll down the window, cruise and just listen to the music.  Thanks to Pitch Perfect in introducing David Guetta and his mixes.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very insightful.  I loved doing the experiments.  I highly recommend this book.  I'm going to read it again soon just to get pick up information that I may have glossed over!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|It was a lot of fun. Lots of action and visually interesting. Really good movie! I recommend it to anyone.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|I started this book thinking that it was going to the same story that this author has already told in previous novels but instead I was<br />captivated by each story and was sad when the book ended.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Surprisingly a good movie!  We all loved it!  It was a nice family night for all of us!!!  Loved the ending.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Liked the movie a lot...surprised to see Brad Pitt in this type of movie..scary fast zombies not slow walkers, but runners and rabid...
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I am so glad I took the plunge and purchased the second book in the series after buying `Operation Armada.' This one is actually deeper and more complex and a little more sophisticated than the first one. I really felt the author got inside Ian Fleming's head this time around. I also loved the evocative descriptions of 1940s Cairo and German East Africa. There are lots of cool action sequences, naturally, and the ending is amazing. The last line is absolutely perfect. This was a very enjoyable and absorbing read. Now I am feeling impatient for the third book in the series, `Operation Uncle Sam.'
B0050DIWFC|5.0|An interesting development throughout the  story.  A compelling read, one so realistic  it is difficult to remember it is a novel, not a biography!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I know all about Ian Fleming's life and I have read all the James Bond books. This author has craftily taken the juiciest parts of Fleming's biography and somehow managed to create a narrative out of the collage. For the most part it works. I would like to have seen more depth to Fleming's character but I suppose this is in the spirit of the genre - this book is more of a thriller than a literary biography. The action is nail-biting. The witty one-liners come thick and fast and for the most part are very funny. There's a femme fatale, naturally, and the character is actually one of the best in the story. I also liked the depiction of the French. This book is the first in a series. I definitely plan on checking out Book 2.
B00F52YOPA|3.0|Really like the game and the variety of of the elements.  Like that it reshuffles the scenes so locations of objects are not predictable.  I would like to know if Level 88 is the end or if there is more that is just no working.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I can still feel my heart in my throat. This has everything anyone could possible want from a thriller. I am still stunned. Bravo!
B000I9X67W|4.0|We have not seen Drumline in some time but like Nick Cannon from American's Got Talent. We bought it to have in our video library.
1594204217|5.0|Just a fun read. I have always ate well but now I got some delicious was of doing other meals. Ha sorry that's what I pulled away from the book the most. But really informative on how man does things with his food.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is my first time reading this Author. I loved her enjoyable  characters. The stories were relatable and I can't wait to read more by Liane Moriaty.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works right out of the box.  Using it in Singapore with VPN to watch uncensored movies on YouTube and NetFlix.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It was a little slow starting but I did not stop reading as I would normally do.  I love the Scarpetta character and ending up not being able to put this down.  I would recommend this, it was enjoyable.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|It's like reading 10 different nooks in one. Impossible to follow the story and characters. Not like his other books at all.

B004J4XGN6|4.0|I am a SCORE mentor and I teach business planning.  In that context, this book had a number of valuable insights which I have already passed on to my clients who are software companies. I agree with Ries' concepts of MVP and pivoting for example.  However, this book of is of little value if the company you are starting is not software related.  Despite Ries' claim for broader applicability, almost every example in the book relates to software development related businesses. Who else can profit from advice on quality or frequency or releases, for example?  Given the author's software background, this isn't too surprising. In fact, as long as you know that when you start reading, it's excellent. But, if you are in retail or manufacturing,the book isn't going to be of much value.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|While this movie had plenty of action, the Iron Man series seemed to become increasingly disappointing. 1 was better than 2, and 2 was better than 3. Iron Man-3 lacks the WOW that the other Marvel movies deliver.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Must own. Easy to use and manage. Probably one of the best free apps or tools available on kindle period.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Binged through 13 episodes of Hannibal last night. Wow. For the record, this is my first review ever on Amazon EVER and I felt I owed it to the actors and the producers and all the talent involved to tell everyone how incredible this show is. If you have ever read the books, this show is extremely loyal to the text, and therefore the character development and build-up is fantastic. The production and visuals are absolutely GORGEOUS, I mean flat-out delicious to look at. And they all serve a purpose, from Hannibal's exquisite dining dishes hand-prepared, to walking through a crime scene in the volatile mind of Will. The crime scenes are even more disturbing than Seven, you will be immersed completely into a beautifully dark world. The soundscapes are chilling. The tone is wonderfully dark. And the acting is top-notch. I've recently been such a huge fan of the extremely talented Mads Mikkelson, and he carves out a brilliant Hannibal Lecter that I absolutely find irresistible. Fascinating, scary, uber-cool and collected, dangerous, intelligent, refined, and primal all at the same time. The anticipation for when and how he will strike is worth every episode. His rendition of Lecter is iconic. Hugh Dancy no less does a magnificent job as Will. The way you see his character becoming engrossed into the minds of killers and the crime scenes, his descent towards madness and his inner delusions taking him over symptom by symptom becomes unsettling to watch simply because his performance is that genuine. Bravo to the leads for such committed performances, the chemistry between the leads is irresistible. Gillian Anderson and Eddie Izzard also make for wonderful supporting characters and guest appearances.<br /><br />I can't even wait for Season 2. If you remotely liked Seven, Girl with a Dragon Tattoo, Shutter Island, or any psychological thrillers, be prepared to see a wonderful slow-burn psychological thriller, gorgeous, dark, and something that will stick with you after the finale. Get this on BLU-RAY!finale. Get this on BLU-RAY!
B00BMEF8UA|4.0|I don't usually like dvd/cd combos as I pay for cds I'll probably never listen to. It's all about the dvds for me. That said this neat little package packs good value as the dvd is worth every penny of the purchase price by itself. Amazon shouldn't list this as an audio cd because the dvd is definitly the main selling feature. The packaging(very nicely done by the way)is cd sized so I guess that confuses them. On to the dvd, audio mix could be a bit better & I wish we might have seen a bit more of the Kourion site worked into the concert. I'm not familiar with the bands history but I can say that Stu Block's singing was impressive. Can't see any metal fans not liking this show, so pick it up if you're sitting on the fence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for all ages. Once you play this game for so much you get addicted to it.
B008ENA74E|4.0|Pretty amazing how the beginning of the books pumps up Goldman into such a great company, then it all turns. I enjoyed the book and read it quickly.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game and it is not a rip of! It makes me feel like I have a real horse .<br />Most games I buy are about horses but most of them are rip offs! I don't have a real horse but this makes me feel like I do.

B00D8HNR5W|5.0|I thought the Wave Goodbye Tour was the end for NIN, but Trent is back at it again with this latest album.<br /><br />Whilst listening I find myself thinking of the two latest albums to precede it, Year Zero and With Teeth. Many of the songs contained within the release feel like they pull from or pay tribute to those albums. For me, that works out great. I loved Year Zero, and liked With Teeth enough even though it felt 'toothless' at times. I've taken to combining my favorites from the previous two albums and placing them in the mix with this new one. It makes for a great playlist.<br /><br />Overall I think this a wonderful album and a great return to NIN for Trent. The only song I don't care for is &#34;Everything&#34; but that is just my personal taste.
B0034G4P80|1.0|This item was a copy.  Not a good copy at that.  It skips and gets stuck in the best parts.  Very frustrating.  I recommend not buy from this person again.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love anything Star Trek! I hope the reboot continues in this time line with JJ Abrams at the helm..
0452295548|5.0|I am finding this book to be very informative.  I am not a medical person but I am able to understand the information.  The information in the book has given me a new way to think about and appreciate what a marvel the brain is.  The best way to read this book is to read it slowly.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this album, loved it since I was in my mid teens and I'll always love it. Its because of this album Rock became palatable to me and I now have such a wealth of awesome music in my life which adds depth and richness and also makes me so happy and my life so much better. I'm so grateful for LP and Hybrid Theory without them I don't think my life would as it is now.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|High Rez sound with flac and MPEG 3 on home theater.  I also have Beatles Love in DVD Audio and wonder why the USB couldn't be produced like it as the DVD Audio has amazing sound.  Anyway, if you have nice equipment you'll enjoy !
B000ZK4466|5.0|I've never been able to articulate the love I have for TMV and their music and its no difference with The Bedlam in Goliath, to me its a awesome, well crafted album that I love but if your not familiar with TMV you might want to find something different. I also I learnt that regardless of how much I love this album I can't listen to it when I go to sleep as I tend to have really disturbed, restless sleep or really weird dreams (I'm guessing the creepy album art and the somewhat demonic ouija board played a part). TMV fans will not be disappointed and for the adventurous music lovers hold on as its a ride like no other. &#60;3 IT!
B00DQVST76|5.0|What can I say it's Madonna of course it's awesome. She will forever be the queen and I will forever be a fan!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is an awesome way to express your love for my little pony. Although it's not the best.....but I know I loved playing it and my sister loved it too. The minigames were awesome too.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|what can I say it's Madonna no need to say much more!!!! loves it! She will forever be the queen!
0670033375|4.0|For class use, but definitely a good book to read. As others said, might be a bit repetitive here and there, but the author chooses the topic right on spot. I am kind of surprised by the rich details and scientific evidences the author has used to support his argument. Now I am putting his another book on my reading list, Guns, Germs, and Steel, which seems even better than this one.
B0015NORBE|1.0|One of my favorite records of all time. Unfortunately, my brand new record was scratched at the beginning of &#34;I'm Set Free.&#34; Otherwise everything was fine, just... purchase with caution.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This is a very challenging Lego system that my son really enjoys, putting it together. We will be buying the whole set.
B0081336FO|5.0|This was great fun and genuinely entertaining. enough information is presented so that they foreshadow the next move. and it does (mostly) make sense.<br /> great  fun.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This game has such good graphics. You can do amazing things on this game. The LeBron James mode is my favorite.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Love the series. What more can I say. Miss them. Wish the series did not have to end. Need. More like this. Not reality tv.
