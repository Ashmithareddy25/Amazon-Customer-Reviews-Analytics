B008X9Z37A|5.0|Perfect! I love it. The size is right and easy to handle. Easy to use with Kindle inside and using it
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|movie worked well on kindle & like the x-ray effect & sound quality was very good it didn't have any buffering so the movie didn't stop or pause at any time
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is my first Asphalt game I've played. I usually don't buy games but this was only 99 cents and I love racing games so I said what the hay I'll do it! It hasn't disappointed me!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's a fairly addictive game. There's lots of puzzles and mini games to keep you entertained for quite a while.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Just started a couple days ago. It's just so cute and its fun. Find myself keep coming back to the game.
B008X9Z3UC|2.0|It doesn't quite fit the Kindle Fire 7 hd. Needs to be made about an inch larger. Present fit is just too small
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Impetus for people of all ages to follow ones own Personal Legend in which I call the meaning of life.
0596806027|4.0|Contains essential information for who wants to start the study of HTML5, very didactic.Recommend for all self-taught like me, good luck.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I was a little skeptical about ordering a used CD, but the product was much better than expected. It arrived in a timely fashion and appeared as if it had never been touched. Just as good as new.<br />Love this CD, can't stop listening to it!
B0037QGS0A|5.0|Simply great. I loved everything about this film: acting, music, the beautiful Toronto in winter. We rarely see such a nuanced psychological fare so beautifully dramatized on screen. Catherine, our heroine, faces disappointment in love. She becomes a lover herself. True love is always directed to a woman who doesn't have anything to give back. Catherine loves young Chloe for what she doesn't have, just as her husband ought to have loved her. Chloe &#34;incorporates&#34; Catherine's husband. Catherine is enjoying her own femininity IN ANOTHER WOMAN --- in Chloe -- at the hand of an unseen man, her husband. This film is even better than the French original &#34;Nathalie&#34;. I highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I usually get tired of games in a week but I've had this for a few weeks now and am still enjoying it. It's been very addictive.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|a terrific conclusion to the series. Definitely wraps the whole story up, without contradicting the plot lines from the show. Standalone, its a wonderful movie, but it feels more like the final episode of Firefly, rather than a motion picture.
0525950079|5.0|Fantastic Read.  I could not stop reading this very captivating story.  Best of 4 Ken Folletts reads and moving to number 5
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's a very enjoyable game for everyone. I do wish though that some of the selections had more instructions to help guide me. I do recommend this game to anyone!!
B004YM6JI2|4.0|I'm glad I bought this. They've gone about three seasons further than they needed to, but the cast is so good at their craft, that I watch it just for the actors/actresses. Not a strong story line, however. If you are so-so about the series, I would suggest asking a friend to loan it to you.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It is a fun movie to watch alone or with family. Waiting eagerly for part two to be released. :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had heard of this show back ten years ago when it aired, but didnt pay it much attention. until a friend recently introduced me to it. Cant believe what i missed all those years ago. for anyone who enjoys watching people grow together, overcome obstacles, and come out on top, this series is a must see. For those people who like westerns and sci-fi, then you'll be in heaven
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Jack Reacher is a fantastc character.  Would love more Jack Reacher movies if they were this good.  Love the old time movie feel.  Reminds me of Walking Tall with updated fight scenes.
0593071980|1.0|\\"The Kill List\\" is a huge let down. I am a die hard Forsyth fan and \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" is my all time favourite book. I've read and loved all of his fiction - \\"The Avenger\\", \\"The Odessa File\\", \\"The Fourth Protocol\\", \\"The Devil's Alternative\\" etc. and this one is by far the worst. While it has the traditional Forsyth research and detail, there's no suspense. Most of his books have roughly equally matched antagonists locked in a battle of wits so it is always suspenseful. The Tracker in \\"The Kill List\\" is leagues ahead of The Preacher in resources, intellect and foresight. As a result, there is very little suspense and the ending could hardly have been anything else. Anyone expecting the customary Forsyth twist will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />In short, I would not recommend this book to any reader. I'd rather read one of his old novels again.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|While this is an almost purely formulaic romantic comedy, Bradley Cooper and, especially, Jennifer Lawrence positively light up the screen with their performances and chemistry. Robert DeNiro adds charm way beyond the size of his role. This is a very fun, engaging movie.
B009HOU672|5.0|If you are a Vivaldi fan this will give you a whole new perspective on the work.  Max has really captured the feeling of the piece.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This Album Is Great The Bobby Caldwell Cover Is Amazing...Overall It's What John Always Does If Your A Fan You'll Love It And If Your Not It May Bore You. Strictly For Grown Up Music Lovers Leave The Kids At Home On This One Beautiful Album , Open Your Heart And Your Ears For Love In The Future
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Still so much left unknown, unfinished from previous two books and now the author adds the mafia, sex tapes, more exes drama and more complex relationships to keep up with than one book needs.  I wasn't anticipating book 3 would be a cliff hanger and I won't be holding my breath until book 4.  I like Day's books but this series has become too complex with too many entangled characters to tell quality stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game of the year. I say it should get five stars by everyone who has a brain
B003PIUBZS|2.0|HBO's Rome is the natural comparison for this series.  To get Spartacus, subtract the great writing by John Milius and add completely banal television writing, substitute journeyman acting for great acting, and add gobs of pointless violence enhanced by some of the cheesiest special effects I've seen.  I don't expect a series on gladiators to be Pride and Prejudice, but the graphics effects are embarrassingly dumb.  I almost expected balloons saying \\"Splatter\\" or \\"Smash\\" like on the Batman tv series.  It's not entirely fair to judge the actors by this series.  Some of them I suspect are competent to good.  But when you're a cartoon character mouthing cliches it's hard to do much in the way of acting.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that the first disc on my set worked poorly, freezing at a number of points.  It was a struggle to get the DVD player to play it.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|other than the G5 splash page when you first open the game, I'm not getting any in game ads. the individual tables aren't that hard, but the tiles are pretty. a decent time waster.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a simple fun flash game to play when you are bored. Solid Gameplay with a good upgrade mechanic.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is fantastic.  You can even type in portrait mode without feel cramped and clumsy.  I would recommend this to everyone!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Spectacular landscape shots, combined with mimalist living quarters is a nice touch. Overall the acting is good, the plot twists keep you wondering what is going to happen next and the science fiction isn't too hard to follow. Throw in a love story, hope for humanity and it is a good, entertaining movie.<br /><br />Having seen the movie now, I see some parallels with Stargate with a little bit of Matrix thrown in. There are a few holes once you're done watching the movie and you have time to analyze it. I read some reviews that the movie was too long, but I thought it played out fine.
B001EBWITA|2.0|Poorly written, poorly acted hot mess. This should have been so much better. Keanu Reeves was not a good choice for the role, and the story was confusing and not very interesting.
B00594XOZU|5.0|great app everyone should try it you really can keep in touch with all your friends easily its better than facebook
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Amazing yay great awesome I loved every moment of it. It was a true thriller tot the end. I love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|i got my child a tablet i found this game and she likes it :)  this means she'll spend more time on her tablet :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This captured me right from the start.  It was hard to put down.  Very thoughtful and insightful. So well written!
B005MLP71Y|3.0|Cute enough but not a great family favorite.  Safe, clean, funny, enjoyable enough.  Four year old grandson wasn't too interested so may recommend for a child 6 to 8 years.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Kids or no kids the &#34;Toy Story&#34; series will touch you and bring back loads of memories from Childhood - good and bad. We highly recommend all of the movies!
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|Everyone is going to have their own favorite tracks, but for me, the tracks that stand out in this album are Crimson Day and St. James.  I enjoy and appreciate that A7X is not afraid to mix it up with each album release.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|This movie kept stalling throughout trying to watch the movie.  I wished there was a way I could get my money credited back.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|This song makes me think of dancing the night away at a great party. I have been listening to it non-stop!
B000SEI230|5.0|This read was awesome! Shocking but absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed it beginning to end. Your reading a story of a story! It's romantic and truely eye opening
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Yes, you can pretty much basically see what's gonna happen before it does due to the old plots of the studio system and the typical awarements that are place in you through years and years of \\"who is and who done it\\" from movie watching. But, the film in and of itself was just very good and entertaining! Worth the money! I liked it! It was just - a good film. It felt good.
0316017930|5.0|As with all of Malcom Gladwell's work, a must read.  It makes you think about life and how you see it and live it. The take home point is grasp opportunities as they come, because they may not come around again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I enjoy using this app because it is always with me. It comes in handy when you need a fast answer. It is easy to use and the numbers are a nice size for seniors.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|I'm surprised by the rating of this game since Amazon reviewers are usually pretty discriminating. The graphics of this game aren't bad and I could see how it might keep young boys occupied for a little while. But it's really repetitive and not challenging. Maybe if I stuck with it a while it would get harder but I'm really bored so no thanks. It doesn't make it more fun that I can change his outfit. Just keep hitting punch and you win. And I got it for free, I'd be really annoyed if I had paid for it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This application is amazing. It is the best replacement for your Android keyboard. This app combines the powers of Swype and smart  words into one powerful app.
B005FITIDC|5.0|Great story about a guy's struggle with doing the right thing and his belief in God. A story about God's redemption and real life struggles. A must see. Not for children as there are mature themes.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Bought this movie for my wife and I love it. The shipping was quick and easy. There was no hassle in anything and it was exactly what I ordered.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is great, want more as interesting as this one.  Love this manufacturer. Keeps you on your toes and guard up all the time.  Not familiar with the wall and tracking but learning to piece together each clue.
0345472322|5.0|My wife, a teacher/administrator in Montessori, and I, a physician, struggle with finding the key to getting our students and patients to step up to the game at hand.  This book seems to shine light on this search.  We both want to learn more.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My Kindle Fire had most of its memory locked up to the point that it could only handle a few apps, a few books and two short video clips.  I tried to figure from within the Kindle to see what what taking up all the space but found nothing.  I scanned the web to see what others were saying about this issue with the Kindle Fire.  Many suggested that I do a hard reset but I didn't want to lose my settings or the apps already running.  Someone suggested Clean Master.  Long story short, I have now regained about 5 gigs of memory using Clean Master.  Clean Master found dormant apps and other left over files from deleted apps, music and video I had deleted a long time ago.  I have now installed Clean Master to my other Android based machines and getting them cleaned out as well.  Excellent product and worked flawlessly!
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Finally read The Vampire Chronicles after having seen IWAV a dozen times.  I like how Anne writes the books to appear as though Lestat wrote them knowing he wouldn't be believed. I've read the twilight series and all Charlaine Harris's Sookie series books, but had never read the \\"mother\\" of Vampire writers material. She writes darker obviously, but in a way that a person would think it really is to live as a vampire. She also has a philosophical and spiritual depth to her writing which I liked. If you've never read Anne Rice before, start here. I'll be reading more!
B00A27X972|4.0|A warm, satirical, and entertaining story of an alien assimilating into society as a human on Earth. But first, Professor Andrew Martin must die on the account of having solved one of the biggest problems in mathematics, the Riemann Hypothesis. Of course, this also means anyone that may know of the professor's discovery must also be eliminated, including his wife and son. Simple.<br /><br />The first half of the novel is entertaining enough as our nameless Vonnadorian alien slowly learns of the customs and ways of this new civilization he as come upon, especially the value of clothes. He pretty much loathes and despises these primitive ways. Suspension of disbelief is a must for the first half mainly for the descriptive language. There were some concepts and objects that he didn't grasp but had no problem using the understanding that vehicles were reliant on \\"fossile fuels\\" and in upcoming sentences, proceeding to call the vehicles \\"cars.\\"  This is a personal issues; something I had an extremely hard time with but considering the novel is 300 plus pages, I figured, I might as well finish it. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Into the second half of the novel the tone has shifted to an appreciation of the arts, dogs, familial relationships, and the complexities of emotion. By all means this is no \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" by Robert Heinlein; don't expect commentary on the sexual revolution, religion, greed, war or anything else vis-&agrave;-vis the late 60's to early 70's. Well some but it's to be expected when you do a clich&eacute; theme of bringing an outsider into human culture. Towards the end of the novel, we're granted 97 tenets of life and how to live as learned by our Vonnadorian. And you know what, they're not bad. It's nothing too deep or too profound; things you or I may already know, but Mr. Haig has a great way of putting them into words. Words that any human should live by.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I must start this review by saying I am probably not the intended audience for this book.<br /><br />This book is obviously the culmination of the Hunger Games series.  The whole premise of the series is somewhat interesting and has been attempted before in Japanese and other literature.  The story in itself is not unique.  All that being said, this story is how I would a child to view war and life threatening situations.  The themes in the story are timeless, ie self sacrifice, losing loved ones, violence, war, etc.  The way they are approached are childish.  The protagonist is more concerned with hurt feelings and love interest than gory gruesome violence surrounding her.  All of the dystopian violence in this book is extreme and would drive any narrator insane.  The narrator just goes through this war like a highschool girl goes about her day with no amount of heads blowing up or zombie animal attacks bothering her too much.  This is a really immature stupid book, I can't believe I wasted my time reading this whole series.  If you want a childish and sheltered life view of atrocity, that is what you get.  It is really popular with the younger crowd because of the lack of permanence and happy endings.  Not worth reading unless you are really bored and want to look cool to your kids or sumpin.
B0081336FO|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are incredible, a perfect team. The best Holmes-Watson I've ever seen. A must see, you won't be disappointed.
B000FA675C|4.0|A captivating mystery holds your attention right to the very end and leaves you wanting more clues to the story
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|Bought this as a wedding present for my bride, she loved it!  Consolidates all of the season DVDs in one box at a price cheaper than buying them individually
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have read in a long time.  I only began to read it because it had been recommended to me.  The story itself is rather interesting and intriguing until you get about halfway through it.  It becomes apparent that the author has some ulterior motive in writing this.  Perhaps she has some scorn for men for some reason.  I will not reveal the ending but it left me very annoyed that I had wasted any time reading through the whole thing.  Don't waste your money on this book unless you like trashy vindictive novels.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|So far I've only used this app a couple of times. And I found it to be a nice little tool. This is a very good alarm clock.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I get tired of all the really serious cops and robbers shows.  The big difference with &#34;Castle&#34; is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't show lots of blood and gore.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It learns how you type what you type when you type and predicts with almost 100% accuracy. I sometimes have to just keep tapping the word after hitting the first character. And it also has flow to satisfy people who are used to swype
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I am a Paul Simon fan and this is my favorite of all his solo albums'. The African inspired songs give new inspiration to his style and make it a pleasure to listen to over and over again.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. The DVD played flawlessly. My only issue was with the DVD case. Not sure if all cases are starting to be built like this but the case was really flimzy. There was not enough plastic in the case, in my opnion. DVD might not be protected really well in the case.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I thought this book would cover more of the genius behind Tesla's work. It more focused on his career timeline and partnerships.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The graphics were good and I liked the setup. It was hard to follow the plot, though, so that did detract from my enjoyment since it wasn't an immersive experience.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|have a terrible voice or not talented enough to sing or rap? Auto-Tune the living crap out of it like this clown!<br /><br />Even for Kanye this album is bad. What the hell was he going for? Over-Auto-Tuned EDM? \\"Bleed on the Leaves\\" literary made my ears bleed. he seriously needs to chill with the stupid effects.<br /><br />Kanye tries to be unique, he tries to be himself. and i like that in an artist. I really tried to like this album but it is just painful to listen to. Good thing I didn't actually go out and buy it. I used alternative means to give this album a listen. on the other hand, J Cole's Born Sinner is actually pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. I would look into that if you still haven't.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I own every entry in the Bootleg Series, which I think qualifies me to say this is the most fascinating entry yet.  What distinguishes this one from the rest is that it actually recasts this period of Dylan's work; Self Portrait is among his most reviled albums, but Another Self Portrait makes the case that this period deserves some critical revision.  While it's not his strongest period songwriting-wise, by reinterpreting so many traditional songs, it sounds like he's returning to his roots.  His voice in this period was perhaps at it's strongest (listen to \\"Pretty Saro\\"), and shorn of the excessive production that plagued many of the tracks on Self Portrait, it really shines through.  When I first heard that the next entry in the Bootleg Series was going to be covering this period, I was disappointed.  Having given it a listen, I would say this period in Dylan's career needs to be reevaluated.
B005F3XV62|3.0|We thought it was enjoyable, although not memorable.  Funny moments.  Families with children would most likely find this movie entertaining.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|I love this movie.  I finally bought it off of my amazon.com wish list.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|it is useful for people with hearing problems. My mother in law who is 96 likes it very very much
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good addictive but the Facebook or all these links need to go but just make fake stuff so it's ok
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Not for young children.  Lots of continuous action with plenty of bloody shooting and violence.  Tongue and cheek humor.  Viewers can tell the actors were having fun making this movie.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I loved the movie.  My son was disappointed because it deviated so far from the book, but I still think it was great
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Like all the Jack Reacher stories by Lee Childs, you can't put them down.  You always want to know what is going to happen next.  Always a lot of suspense.  Jack Reacher always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  The question is always the same, how is he going to get involved and what is he going to do, and to whom!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I have always liked his books they keep you guessing. Very hard to put down.Ready to start the next one.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|I related to many of the points Sheryl made in this book and saw myself in so many of her stories. An excellent book that provided great encouragement for me to lean in and sit at the table!
B0015AARJI|1.0|For this price, I wish the controller would have held the charge for longer. My original PS3 controller that came with the console, which is about four years old lasts longer than this one. I am not too thrilled with this product.
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|A super submarine movie. Plenty of suspense and action. I really enjoyed the interaction between the main characters, and the crew, kept me waiting for the next surprise.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a very addictive game. You just want to keep playing but sometimes you run out of energy. So either pay or wait
B003VTZTU8|5.0|I loved reading this book. For anyone working or studying within the sciences it would probably come across a bit simplistic, however for those of us that are not, it is an excellent must-read!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I was hoping to get the Candy Crush Saga GAME on my new kindle.  But then saw all the proprietary issues and realized that wasn't gonna happen.  When I went back to this to use it as a help guide it was worthless.
B008UWEFU6|5.0|This Trilogy was great.. in my opinion. I finished book 3 this morning. It's not hard core and I'm assuming by the lower ratings, others expected hard core. Though I loved it, I'm sure the very end could have been different and I would of liked the ending. I bought the Trilogy on Saturday and finished this morning. Though I didn't buy it here, I bought locally. Doesn't matter where I purchased, the review is same.
0061191981|5.0|I am obsessed with Gordon Ramsey. This book is like you are sitting down and having a chat with with him in person. I can hardly put it down yet don't want to finish it. I want the story to last forever! Its frank and entertaining and makes me laugh. Excellent read!
B003R50FRI|5.0|At the start I loved this book, and the protagonist. By the middle I found him infuriating! This is an excellent piece of work and one I would highly recommend!<br />As an aside - do not google the main character until AFTER you have finished reading the book!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I dislike the new upgrade (downgrade). It is too busy and the advertisements dominate.  I have no desire to earn points and unlock rewards, I just want to check the weather.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|really kept my interest and had a good solid plot. Had nice twists and turns to keep you reading till the wee hours
B008220BLG|5.0|Bought this for my 14 year old after she loved the movie.. she hasn't put it down yet! The story is a bit more complex than the movie, but most are.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun! I love the power ups and they have a lot of different rooms to choose from! I would recommend this game, I have no problems on the kindle fire!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Wasn't really sure what I was getting into...however, this has grown to be one of my favorite TV shows of all time.  I highly recommended it if you like TV shows like Mad Men/The News Room.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|nice handling of the plot and kept changing my mind as to what would happen.......like it when I can't figure it out in the first few chapters.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read. This is definitely a book that made me think about things in a different way.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Having a great time playing this game. Actually has a good progression.<br />Makes fun time for all.<br />Play it. You will see what I mean.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Challenging,  thought-provoking,  attractive,  flawless.  A bit put off by the hints for sale.  Would have liked an explanation up front on how to earn 3 stars.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Good animation.  Decent acting given the plot and characters. Not a bad way to spend an evening but do not expect great cinema.
B0039UTDFG|4.0|The picture quality of these discs is amazing!  Others have complained that they don't like Oprah's narration, but it doesn't bother me.  I don't know how they got some of the footage...truly amazing!  My kids (12 and 9) love to watch, and so do I.
B000T433CO|4.0|When you're not in the mood for violence and hard truths; when smut and profanity are irritants, not stimulants; when a sweet romance between charismatic characters seems just the ticket, this is the movie for you. The Holiday has been my \\"go to\\" movie for years. It's the one I turn on when I need to decompress. Light and lively, filled with beautiful people in a lovely setting, upbeat and funny, it is a soothing balm for a stressed out soul in a mad, mad world. On a really bad day, you might add a bowl of ice cream, but if you settle in first and let this charming movie work on you for a bit, you might save yourself the calories.
B002AS466O|4.0|The only problem was that it had English subtitles. The movie was packed with a lot of action it was a thrilling ride and it was funny.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Totally fell asleep. The movie never grabbed me. Super boring. The only good thing about it was Ewan McGregor (who I usually don't like), which makes me sad because I love Stanley Tucci, but I felt he was poorly used in the movie.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Other than Hannibal, my favorite of the Hannibal series. Again great insight into how Hannibal became the monster that we know today.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Short chapters with cliff hangers remind me of dan brown.  Good near-future sci fi that leaves the door open for other adventures.  I just bought the next series.
B005PK57NU|5.0|My wife and I bought a earphone splitter for our Kindle, downloaded season 4 of The Good Wife and watched it on our flight to visit friends for Labor Day Weekend.  A great togetherness experience.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros:  7.1 sound is fantastic.  very realistic, quality sound.<br />Cons: Battery life is a bit inconsistent and no way to charge when PC is off, Included drivers cause disconnections, can get warm over ears, documentation lacking.<br /><br />If you get these, visiting the logitech site is a MUST to get the latest drivers to stop the 5/30/60 min random disconnects.  Aside from that, they are well worth the value, after 3 weeks including a few drops, they are working great.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|While it sometimes feels like the game cheats, with enough determination I did end up unlocking everything without purchasing any additional content. In most instances I also figured out what I had done wrong the previous time but sometimes it does feel like it cheats (when for example, no matter what you do an island won't get infected) hence the 4 stars. Other than that I truly enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone that likes strategy games. Also I hate the idea of in app purchasing so I appreciate the option to unlock everything by playing the game.
1401230423|5.0|Wow why haven't i read this earlier fantastic series very good stuff will not disappoint! Neil Gaiman is my hero... ok that a bit much but he is an excellent writer and the illustrations arent bad to.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I love the case much better than the product. It's material is very good for protecting the electrical equipment. I bought the white cover and still the dirt did not stick with it because it can be easily cleaned with whatever you clean your desk.<br /><br />One thing though, the front cover is very soft so when you place the kindle in a standing position, it may fall.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I don't know if this is Buddy Guy's best CD, because I don't own any others, but I do know that somebody put together a serious band to back him up, and it works real well. Real good !
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Mi pel&iacute;cula favorita de Pixar. Lastima que no tiene audio en espa&ntilde;ol aunque no se necesita mucho, ya que los di&aacute;logos son pocos.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting &amp; I just love it. Sometimes the game freezes but that's ok. It's good for kids &amp; adults.
B00ENBS74I|1.0|Where is episode 3? This is crazy to spend this much for a full season and not receive it! Please add it soon!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Just need to get used to this new product but I think i will manage. I would recommend it to try it out.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|It's very rare to catch something on TV that doesn't have profanity or twerking! My kids love how MacGyver can make a device that saves the day out of a blade of grass and it has the usual explosions that such adventure dramas require - I only take away a star because of the horrible theme music. (Certainly the 80s have better TV themes than MacGyver!) But entertaining for a family trying to please from 5 years to 13 years old.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Showed the kids the movie after seeing it a LONG time ago.  Great family movie, but a couple cussing(s***) words and kind of scary scene with the brother.  Great Prime streaming movie for movie night at home...
B004I744AS|5.0|Awesome!  I love the extras (word of the day, quote of the day, brain teasers, etc.) and usually end up spending more time with it than expected. I also appreciate all of the info provided about the word that I look up. Definitions are there as well as thesaurus info &amp; root meanings.  Very detailed, and complete. Lots of good info!
0786838655|4.0|My family and I saw the movie first; and although we couldn't remember much about it (says a lot about the film) my son wanted to read the books now that the sequel is out and so we got the first book. My wife has been reading it to my son nightly and both he and I have been enjoying it, lol - thus leading us to watch the first film again.<br /><br />The book takes its time introducing the characters and slowly leads into the plot, where as the movie tells you the plot right in the beginning. This I thought took away from the story. I love movies, but can admit when the book is better.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show. I'm addicted to it. I can't wait for the 3rd season to start. September 21 2013
1781162646|4.0|Very well told, as usual, with a great treatment of characters. Nice memories of decades past. I love all his books
B004YW4L5K|1.0|Maybe it's just me, but I really was not taken with this book. I have really enjoyed other books by Gaiman, but this was I found boring and struggled to even get through it.
B00AG472DS|4.0|Great movie! Really keeps you engaged and on the edge of your seat. The extras on the Blu-ray are also interesting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great book! Twists and turns that I never saw coming. Not sure where it will go from here, but I'm buying Shift now!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I am very happy with my weather app, it is very consice and easy to read, so far has been correct....Roger Hagon.
030758836X|2.0|The book starts out with Nick, the main character admiring the back of his wife's head and a few chapters later goes missing. From there on out, I was hooked as I wanted to find out what really happened to his wife. I read half of the book and loved it and as I inched closer to the end, I was counting down pages thinking - wait, evil can't possibly win, can it? When I reached the end of the book, I felt sick. The ending is impossible and frankly so unrealistic. I feel like I wasted three days of my life on this crap. Yes, the book was well-written, but it simply wasn't enough. It seemed like the author just got sick of telling the story and thought \\"well let me finish my book at page 415, that sounds like a good number.\\" This book didn't really didn't live up to the hype.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie for little girls and big girls a like. A must see for the family. I'd watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its one of the best games ever. everybody needs to get his game. I love it so much. so many rooms.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I picked this up because I love John Green's youtube vids.  It's not a bad book, but I wasn't impressed.<br /><br />Basically, it's a cancer kid book.  The characters are very aware of the cancer kid cliches and point them out during the course of the book.  Then it doesn't really end up doing anything different than the usual expected cliches.<br /><br />The characters are all likeable and it's solidly written.  So if you really like books about people with fatal diseases/illnesses, this is an excellent one of the genre.  It's just not anything special and I really don't get the big to do about it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|...and I can't even tell you about the ending. *sniff*<br /><br />Daniel can finally put the catastrophe called Quantum of Solace behind him.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I downloaded this app for some *old time* games. These are similar to the old arcade games, which is exactly what I was looking for! Fun to play when I have a moment to fill.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I loved this whole entire cd! It was well written and if you're looking for a very chill cd, then this is it!

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I love this. It keeps my Magic Mouse charged at all times. Also looks great on my desk (glass top).
B0053TMP24|4.0|I'm an adult reader and have enjoyed the Percy Jackson series. I'm glad the characters have returned. I think a kid might give it a higher rating.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Just a great all around movie. Thoroughly enjoyed the acting, plot, and music. The facial expressions throughout are hysterical. Enjoy.
B000002GVZ|5.0|It's a great album.  I have always loved her work and this is just a very compilation of that.  Terrific
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love my solitaire, I can now take it to bed and don't have to bother with my lap top, fantastic!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|After 13 novels and one prequel, this epic conclusion has ended a chapter in my life.  Having spent the last twenty plus years eagerly awaiting the next installment of RJs WoT and anticipating the Last Battle, it was bittersweet to have the conclusion in hand.  Well, the Last Battle has arrived and it was AWESOME.  The Dark One, The Chosen, dreadlords and trollocs are all on the move.  The fractured forces of the Light must unite, resist and, hopefully, triumph.  It is all out battle which is a dramatic change from earlier volumes which focused more on character development and world building storylines.  Everyone is off to battle and, while it is not a GRR Martin bloodbath, there are fatalities among the core characters which are handled in a well thought out, though painful, process.  Overall, it was a very good but not perfect ending to a classic series.<br /><br />There were three concerns which kept this from being a 5 star book for me. First, I would have preferred for the transition from the previous carefully crafted character driven novels to this epic action driven novel to have been more seamless.  MINOR SPOILER:  Second, it was hard for me to accept that there were new additions to the Dark One's forces and that Demandred's obsession with Lews Therin led to very poor decisions.  ANOTHER MINOR SPOILER:  Lastly, the concluding paragraphs were too abstract and not as satisfying as I would have preferred.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time will go on but the series has concluded.  This was a good ending which I think that most fans will enjoy.  Honestly, it is impossible to miss for any who have read this far.  Please sit back and enjoy reading the grand finale of this epic series.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Similar to other reviews, good special effects (not great) and a theme that seemed all to familiar. I enjoyed it and did not feel like it was a waste of time. So it is recommended but wait until the rent is cheaper or free through Prime.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I was worried how they could pull this off, but this movie is amazing for any comic book or action movie fan. One of my favs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best interaction with entirely different social standings, if they live in the Abby they are family, no matter where they come from.

B000068FXX|4.0|I really love Fool's Overture and thought since I am a Supertramp fan I should own the whole cd and give the other songs a chance. A couple are too familiar from radio play, a couple others are 'eh'. and a couple others are good. So it is not a favorite cd to listen to the entire thing.
B001KZG99A|4.0|As always this is a great movie with lots of humor that keeps you laughing your way through.  You have either love or hate them all.

B0058VW36U|4.0|What can I say, this is a classic now!, I find it cute while omnom is chewing the candies.<br />definitely a logic puzzler that is presented in a non-boring cute stage.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The one liners Maggie Smith's Character gives are very witty and fun to experience.  The acting is superb and the story keeps you coming back.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Great pictures!! I like the idea behind the movie. It's rationale and big. However, I expected from the movie; specially at the beginning.
B003CP72QK|5.0|I enjoyed Law Abiding Citizen quite a bit.  It was entertaining throughout and you were able to feel for both the protagonist and that antagonist.  Well done.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is a great book in the series by far. I love how the author described the gods and camp half-blood.:-)

B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's really fun because you have to find different clue to get out of the room you are in. There is a 100 different levels in the game. The higher level you get into the harder it gets.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Just an casual game to pick up and play. But it'll eventually get dull.... until you ponder on deleting it from your device.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. John Green is solo talented and I recommend this book for all!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|while it was a good read and Chris Kyle did his best to make it a warts and all book, it was a very hard look at what goes on in these war zones, and what happens when they go home, these men pay a high price to serve their Country, but what disturbed me was his constant statement that he enjoyed Killing people , everyone knows it goes on and that solders are turned into Killing machines in the case of Chris Kyle I get the impression that they didn't have wind him up at all that he was ready to go the minute they gave him a gun and pointed him at the enemy, he became the most prolific Sniper in the American Forces for Confirmed kills, I think we would all be staggered if we knew how many unconfirmed kills this man had, and it beggers the question how do the Army, Navy etc unwind these men when they leave the forces how do they turn the Killer instinct off

B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I was faced with a dilemma.  I was running out of memory on my 32GB iPad.  I had over 10GB of photos, and 5GB of electronic publications on the device and I wanted to store more!  I deleted as many unused apps as I could.  I removed the publications that I could live without... not enough room.  I needed a way to increase my iPads storage.  I did the research and came across the MobilLite Wireless device from Kingston.<br /><br />This unit provides a way to share data with up to  three (3) separate devices at the same time by creating a WiFi hotspot.  You have the ability to secure this connection (and I highly recommend doing so) by following the instructions provided with the unit.<br /><br />The communications with the device is accomplished by using a FREE APP called MolibeLite found in the AppStore.  Once downloaded and installed, you can access the data contained in devices that are connected to the MobileLite's SDHC or USB ports.  You can connect, and access, 2 external devices at the same time.  Setup is easy.  And it works.  I connected 3 devices via WiFi and streamed video from a USB Flash drive to 2 IOS devices and video from an attached SDHC card to an attached MacBook.  NO LAG!  Worked like a champ!<br /><br />There is also another app that can be used with the MobileLite called FileExplorer.  This app is also a FREE app available from the app store.  I have not really used this app extensively.  I really cannot speak to it at this point.<br /><br />I currently have offloaded from my iPad: several GB of photography training videos/classes to USB Flash Drives;  over 3/4 of my photographs and all of my electronic eBooks to either SDHC cards or USB Flash drives.<br /><br />I have freed up over 19GB on my iPad!<br /><br />This device expanded my iPad's memory!  If I need more memory for the MobileLite, all I need to do is buy another USB Flash Drive, or SDHC card.  I basically have limitless storage...  Well...  as long as I can afford to buy additional storage drives.  Those are much cheaper than buying a larger fixed capacity Wifi storage device.<br /><br />Would I recommend this device to anyone? Yes.  Without any reservation.<br /><br />It does exactly what I needed/wanted it to do.<br /><br />BTW.. if you need an emergency battery backup for your iPhone...  the MobileLite can provide that too....  Nice little bonus.
0790731983|5.0|This movie is not for children. However, it is a well written, well acted, and most of all a well performed musical that uses the Kit Kat Club as a symbol for what was occurring  in Germany as the Nazis come to power in the 30's. Bob Fosse's choreography is superb. Liza Minnelli was at her best. Joel Grey killed the role of the MC. And then of course there is the young Michael York who the camera loves. I think I know the lyrics to the songs written by Kander and Ebb better than the lyrics to the Sound of Music. This movie was was one of the great movies of 1972 (Godfather, Sounder, Lady Sings the Blues, Cabaret). I'm glad I was alive then and seeing the movie again only reaffirmed for me its greatness.  One of the most terrifying moments in the movie is when the German youth starts singing &#34;Tomorrow Belongs to Me&#34; with an angelic face and voice to match, and gradually converts into a militant Nazi Brownshirt full of nationalistic pride and hate. Gives me chills. My girlfriend liked this movie and &#34;so do I&#34;.
140006922X|5.0|If you're looking for confirmation of your particular belief system, I don't recommend reading this book.  If however, you're interested in the political and social climate of first century Palestine from a biblical historical perspective, along with a who's who list of active participants and their respective roles in history, then by all means, pick up this read.  Reza Aslan delivers a quick paced synoptic overview of the area's verifiable history and the people that participated in early events.  He attempts to peel back the many layers of religious dogma surrounding Jesus of Nazareth and I think succeeds, although Aslan can be a bit of a philistine at times in his abrupt denouncements of what many of the faithful take as sacred.  To the charge that Aslan had an agenda in writing this history, I suspect that he's guiltier than he can ever admit.  See if you agree with me.  Read this book to be entertained, enlightened and informed.  Don't read this book for confirmation of an historical/dogmatic connection.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I admit it ... I adore this artist. Well, there was that one exception, but I forgive him that one misstep. Truly, his words and music speak to me. Right?

B00E193TM2|4.0|their last two records weren't that great this is kind of a return album but heavier on some songs. although I don't like hip hop the mama said knock you out cover song wasn't bad. Burn MF was not original but good. I thought it was weird on i.m.sin that max cavalera was featured on it he's a metal legend guy on a song that wasn't anywhere near death metal. overall not a bad record.

B007N3GZ9C|5.0|Everyone who knows a victim of brain trauma needs this book. I wish I had read it after my mother had her stroke. I spent 13 unhappy years as her caretaker. There was very little offered,23 years ago to the patient or the caretaker of brain trauma victims,and what was offered was not beneficial.My mother died feeling angry alienated and abandoned by her family even though she had round the clock care in her own home.I ended up resentful,exhausted and with health problems. If I had this book it would have helped me to understand my mothers very different personality and how to care for her post stroke.<br />My husband recently had a brain trauma and now I have the tools to help him.This book made all the difference for me as the caretaker.Now patient and caretaker are both happier.

B00EQUP3Q6|2.0|A few points on my first two initial listens to Hesitation Marks in its entirety...<br /><br />**First I want to say that I don't see/hear too many parallels to TDS.<br /><br />**There's a good amount of similarity to With Teeth and Year Zero as far as song structure and delivery. There's even a sprinkle of the sounds found on The Fragile.<br /><br />**However, this album feels very electronica heavy and yet too minimal and hollow at the same time. It's kind of wierd, actually.<br /><br />**I hate to admit it, but it almost sounds like Trent went through his entire back catalogue and found all of the tiny elements that made those albums/songs great and tried to incorporate ALL of them in here...the whispers, the little noises (machines and otherwise), the plucky piano, the thick dripping bass lines, the fuzzy guitars out of nowhere. There's no cohesive sound to the record as a whole.<br /><br />**I'm not super fond of the vocal delivery on this album and the lyrics feel hollow and almost disingenuine to me. For example... Remember your first heartbreak? Remember the first half dozen or so times you told other people that story? Now think about how much emotion and conviction is lost when you tell the same story more than 2 decades later. That's how I feel about the context and themes on this particular record. It's doesn't feel personal, instead it feels semi-scripted.<br /><br />**I don't hate this album. There are some very nice elements to the songs. But, I don't love it yet either. To be fair, when I was 14, TDS came out and I did not like it for a couple of years (with the exception of Closer and Becoming). TDS grew to be a wonderful monster in my collection that I am compelled to revisit from time to time. Also when the Fragile came out I was 19 and I hated that it didn't sound like TDS. I guess my point here is that, I am sincerely hoping this album grows on me at least a fraction of how those two did. It will never live up to TDS or The Fragile, but those were magnum opi.<br /><br />**So as not to sound completely negative about the record, there are some really nice soundscapes and funky synth lines here. There are even tiny little knives of sound in the tracks that you can truly enjoy and appreciate with a good pair of headphones (which is the only way to listen to Trent and Co.)<br /><br />As I further form a more in depth opinion, I'll update this review. If you never hear from me post on this album again, then it's because it has fallen to the way-side.<br /><br />**For the moment, it gets 2 stars.<br /><br />P.S. The poppiness of \\"Everything\\" is annoying the p1ss out of me as I close this review.re magnum opi.<br /><br />**So as not to sound completely negative about the record, there are some really nice soundscapes and funky synth lines here.

B00006879E|5.0|What can I say?  It's Maroon 5 and they are just awesome.  Very easy download from Amazon, great song, sounds great on my iPod.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love it!!! I hate to put it down but one has to work - adds so much to the series.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Surprisingly much better than Book Four...predictably as the author suggested, you are finally pulled deep into the story with the missing gaps and story lines filled in quite spectacularly. No wonder it took so long to write. To connect the various threads and introduce even more new colorful characters with more twists and turns and yet I can finally keep track of the various story lines and protagonists. In a word, fun.
1439152810|5.0|Loved the mixture of the past and the present in the story to always keep the reader interested.  Excellent story that leads up to an amazing and not-anticipated ending!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love it!!! I hate to put it down but one has to work - adds so much to the series.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Probably my all time favorite movie. In my opinion Matthew Macfadyen is the best Mr. Darcy. I also loved Kiera Nightly in this movie.
B00DGQF0K0|3.0|Its okay honestly that is the best explanation.  It will hold a small child's attention better I think.  It does have different ways for you to have to find objects to help you escape. (Shaking your device, holding your device sideways...etc.)
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|I like games that get me hooked. This doesn't do it for me'<br />Hopefully this helps. I would like less interruptions from the characters. Less notes I can see what I'm getting and doing I don't need pop up characters telling me what I just did and what I earned.
B004SIP6LS|5.0|The kickstart to the Jay and Silent Bob legacy. Kevin Smith is a comedy genius. Buy it, buy it NOW!
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! quite simply is the finest telling of the story and build up to the Pearl Harbor attack ever made.  Micheal Bay's film is a poor substitute.  the quality of the bluray is magnificent.<br /><br />Crisp sound and video, only complaint is the pictures make the book seem larger than it is. But that's a minor quibble when the movie is the main event.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|Loved the book but can't wait to read what happens next. I expect a twist of some kind ;) definitely recommend it to others xx
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This app is good for children. It's easy to understand. Although, I wouldn't spend money on it, because it's not very entertaining.
B001DJLD1M|2.0|my son like it so when he come to my home he put it on it keep him out of my way
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|High quality show because of phenomenal acting, writing, and balance of legal intrigue with character development. Watched in two sittings.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I could not stop watching this series. Cannot wait for season 4 to start.  Maggie Smith is wonderful. Watch it
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Loved the book couldn't put in down must get the next book a very pleasing read  didn't want  it to end
B00CFA222M|5.0|i got it for litter one so they would have something to see on  the dvd it keep then quit
B00CTESTA8|5.0|High quality show because of phenomenal acting, writing, and balance of legal intrigue with character development. Watched in two sittings.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this book was the best book I've read and it had me on the edge of my seat at all times
0470901071|5.0|Simply awesome.....Flow of thoughts throughout each chapter is simple to understand. Would highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to give his/her CCNA
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This is really fun! I like that you can choose different instruments. It's fun to play the same song on a different instrument and see how it sounds. There is a wide variety of songs, from Christmas songs to folk songs. It is easy to use, which is nice because most piano apps have really small keys and the songs are too difficult to play on a tablet. That is not the case here. The songs are cool, yet easy to play. I highly recommend this game whether you have been playing the piano for years or if you've never done so before. You'll love it.
B00CE28UTK|5.0|CD is good but vinyl adds extra life to the recording. Awesome listening experience!!<br /><br />Highly recommended for all AB fans!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik me! Bored!! 17 always have my phone (typical girl) I'm really sweet and will talk to anyone but DON'T BE A CREEPER OR YOU WILL BE BLOCKED!! Hope to talk soon... :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game it's so fun I can play it all day<br />At first I didn't think I would like it but it's better than ice age village keeps you busy ...<br />This is a must download!!
0525478817|5.0|Loved it!! Such a great book. It made me happy and sad in the best way that only great books can! Must read, even if its YA anyone would enjoy this book. It's easy to read but is still written tastefully.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It's okay game. Nothing special.............................. nothing else to say. It's just a game to kill time when nothing else to do.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I had to read it and it was not as good as it seems so I would not recommend it
B0049P1VHS|5.0|PRESSING PLAY ALL IS AN EDITED VERSION CAUSE PROGRAMING ON THAT BUTTON FEATURE Allows only so many minutes. so its PG13. But for playing 1 episode at a time you get the Mature content! My source is [...]<br />The Walking Dead is the greatest show on Tv! Season Features Ricky Grimes,Morgan an his boy,Shane,Lorie Carter-Grimes,Andrea,Daryl Dixon an brother Myrle,Andrea,T-Dawg,Carl Grimes,Carol an daughter Sophia and Glenn. 6 episodes averaging 42-49 minutes each no comercals wich is amazing!
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|Can't go back to a previous email while reading a present one in full screen without taking you back to the  home gmail tab.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|I love this TV show, it's amazing. There are so many amazing plot twists and great actors. If you haven't seen it yet I strongly recommend it. Do not be fooled: It is not, in any way, a girly show. It has incredible amounts of gore and some violence. Every season has tons of great episodes in it. I STRONGLY recommend. It only gets better. Great acting, great script, good story, and the characters all have inner turmoil. I can even believe I haven't watched this show earlier
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think that this is the best game I have ever played in my life I watch the tv show and all the things for it is as good as the game maybe even better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Its really fun and it also gets you to think. Great time waster. Really glad it was free! I really love thinking games like these.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't one for the teen books turned movies. But since I saw the first movie the hunger games Is all I think about! I'm so glad I was able to read the second book in time for the movie (knowing directors hardly stick to the original story) Overall, Great book and series!
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|We all know to expect change from nin, but change Isnt always for the better. Trent is now a reformed goth punker, get over it. He'll always be our hero, or at least in most of our books.This is a good album if you're expecting an album that is not rocking or hard, maybe if you never heard of nin before. It's not bad, but it isn't really great. Here's an album that loses everything that made Trent nin....him being himself in the moment, I feel like his music now is not really true to who he is now. He's changed, I understand that, but the music just feels contrived. Trent seems happy, but this music isn't exactly happy, it feels mediocre, not extreme in either direction, like it's confused. His melodramatic voice/lyrics don't really fit the beat and music like it used to. This album seems like just a response to fans who became non fans because of his constant change, listen to the lyrics, it mainly mocks fans who later hated nin. I understand There is no more angst, no more soul,extreme creativity, voice of the generation, innovation, something worth saying...the last great thing trent did was the girl with the dragon tattoo soundtrack!$.this album is basically a watered down version of his last 3 nin albums with nothing new to say other than \\"I'm just trying to find my way\\" and that everything in the past is no more, I have changed, get over it.Trent isn't really saying anything important or full of feelings fans can emotionally relate to. this new cd is basically written as a response to \\"fans no longer\\", people who use to be fans but no longer like his change.the lyrics just say look, I've changed, stop harassing me! It's a justification for confusing hard core fans. But it doesn't seem to work. this album is like the new kanye album yeezus meets the knife, only kanye and the knife are much better. it's trendy to a art hipster audience within the time. This album has no soul,or very little of it, like it's been too polished, thought out to death, things that aresaid feel very contrived, vocals don't match the music.inspired Elements of past bands could be found here: bjork, aphex twin, glitchy techno music, minimal techno, and more.<br /><br />The best way to describe this album is to compare it as a metaphor for our generation. This generation no longer has a zeitgeist, no heart, no soul that belongs to a voice of our time...it's like jimi Hendrix being replaced by Lenny kravitz, Martin Luther king replaced by Obama,! painting replaced by computer graphic design, nine inch nails replaced by happiness and fame, confusion. Trent has lost his place, he needs to just write happy music about the good family life instead of this contrived mess, at least then the music would feel real. Goth has been replaced by emo glam, so reznor decides to take a more sophisticated route, designed music...soulless, contrived, worn, energy less, lacking originality/grit//angst/true emotion/innovation/relevance/culture/message/art/rawness...this is a business man putting on a kitschy light show, overworked and stressed...not real...he has nothing left to say, no connection to his audience or the general public other than replaying his old stuff live. Everything is based on research and not heart or emotion.everything has been replaced by watered down versions.this is a reformed hippie punk kid Trent has become.he's more a business man and less an artist, which is fine. hippie culture turned hipster.rebellion shopping at Target stores..!truely the end of subculture.!Meaningless and made to sell. Trent you got my $9.99,and a3 stars I rate this album.!i believe its a great effort but not a great album. be true to your now self, write songs about your family and social life,and business professional life. This is starting to feel too much like Nirvana being replaced by the band Puddle of Mud.art should be about constant change and improvement, not watering down the last 3 albums and trying to be like the new kanye album and the band The Knife, Trent we love u.But 3 stars is for effort, nin still my fav band. I know this album will grow with lots of time. I'll try my best to give it the benefit of the doubt.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play spider just as much or more than I play mahjogg. Sometimes I have a hard time telling when I should be batting off to do other things.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book. It is so well written that I couldn't put it down. I can highly recommend it.
B000V9D5LG|3.0|Have not us it much, will soon. Have been very busy with work. In a few weeks, I will be free to take photos!<br />That is it now, I hope I have put in the amount of words to mail this..
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's memoir is about life and ways to deal with it, in addition to being a memoir of hiking the Pacific Coast Trail. She gets very philosophical throughout the book, and I find it fascinating. This is one I will reread often, I think.
1616551151|5.0|The World of Thedas is such a beautiful book! It has excelent materials for the pages and covers, then the concept arts for both games look even prettier, especially those of landscapes. There are very interesting points about the history of Thedas, although sometimes having less information than some codex entries on the games. The chronological line at the end of the pages through the entire book is very helpful.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  I have seen it twice and picked up other details in the second viewing.  Captures a river, small town movie very well.  The boys in the movie are excellent, tho a couple of blemishes in a couple of scenes where the acting is off(blame the director for not catching it). And well, McConaughey is McConaughey, he plays his part and does not over do it, which is good.  The father figures are excellent.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This and the newer Star Trek movie were my two favorite movies to see on the big screen this year so far.  Pacific Rim was a pleasant surprise.  I saw it in IMAX 3D and glad I spent the extra to view this fun action flick in that format.  Was like watching a good theme park 3D ride that lasted a couple hours.  Character development was quick and to the point, left much to the imagination.  But the characters were quite fitting to the movie, and the action was paced well, without over doing things.  Grab this movie in 3D when the blu ray is released, that is what I am doing.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a fantastic app. Lot's of personalisation capabilities. I love waking up to my choice of music each morning and having multiple alarms saved with their custom settings.
B00BR9XU96|5.0|Ideas and revelations and proven facts about the way one thinks which can change your life and enlighten you.  Loved it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i fall more in love with these characters every episode... can't wait for season 4 to begin!.... i may have to start back at the beginning before january...
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|There are two kinds of people in this world: those who love Baz Luhrmann, and those who can't stand him. I think the man is a creative genius, and \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was even better than I'd anticipated. Everything is perfect: the glitz, the glamour, the excess, and the complete agony of the situation. Critics have blasted this film, claiming that the overabundance of hype severely detracts from the heart of the story, but I disagree. It's amazing! A truly fantastic reimagination of this classic story.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Enjoyed watching this again! Brought back the same feelings as when I saw it years ago! Michael York was wonderful and the battles were intense! Thank-You Amazon!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, it had a pretty good plot, good action scenes without being overly violent, some good twists and the special effects were top notch. I wish Hollywood would make more movies like this.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Oh yea, and did I mention the dancing is enough to get any one up and moving?  A classic that anyone who is interested in dance and movie making should not overlook.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a good hidden picture game. You don't have to buy anything unless you doing have patience to wait till your energy replenish es . They are even making an add-on so you can play with your friends on Facebook and other places.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I recommended this book to many friends, but always with the caveat, &#34;not an easy read.&#34;  The arguments are convincing, the theory well thought out, but somehow the human spark is missing.  It was all so long ago, the layers of myth are very thick and hard to peel away, proof is lacking, and I got the feeling the author was kept busy making every sentence defensible. Interesting premise, though -- I like it.  We need more books like this one.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I think this movie would have been a lot better had they produced it in the spirit of Sound of Music where there was a mixture of dialogue and singing. But watching Russel Crow and Hugh Jackman struggling to sing through every single piece of dialogue was a little painful.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This show is amazing. There were times I often forward I was watching the SAME actress play all these different roles.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|Love it! Easy to watch and download. You should get it if you are a Veronica Mars fan in time for the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best series I've watched, I highly recommend it. If you like romance, period shows or great writing you will love this.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|simply love this movie as much as its sequel , nice movie to watch with the family highly recommend it, they did such great job with this animation especially the little agnes warms your heart !
0307887448|5.0|I've been hearing about this book for a while and I liked it. I'm no critic but it kept me wanting more.
B00E3I3KDE|1.0|I already bought most of the music on this album.  Please release a separate selection of the new songs only.  It could be an MP3 version only if necessary.  I think you may be sacrificing a lot of potential sales by restricting the release to an album that includes a majority of songs that fans have already purchased.  Otherwise I'll be waiting to find a cheap used copy of the album.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I really enjoyed this film. The costumes were fantastic. The acting was really good. The story was of course great. The Jay-Z soundtrack was stupid, a gimmick, and nearly ruined the movie. And I love Jay-Z.
0307740919|5.0|Got it for school, it was great and new and got it on time no problem! The story was good too.
B002ZG981E|5.0|OK, I'm basically a SONY guy. I know a lot of folks out there do not care for the SONY and their proprietary nature, but Blu Ray is AMAZING. I bought &#34;Inception&#34; (which is just a great suspense-action film filled outstanding visual effects) and took the free download option, while waiting for the Blu Ray to arrive. The difference in picture quality and sound was just mind blowing. If you have not seen this movie yet, take the plunge and see it in Blu-Ray!
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I think this is my favorite of the series. I have watched it several times on DVD and on Showtime.
B0031569HE|4.0|Appropriately difficult with lots of explanation of answers.  Would recommend for study along with additional reviews on specific sections. Review sections were helpful to someone who has been out of school for 30 years.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Only wish that It could be used for more than You Tube and Netflix, but it is a great device to own.  Can't wait until expanded for Hulu and Amazon.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|This is a great collection of ZZ songs. If you love the Texas Trio, you will love this CD. Better yet, as a Prime member, I took advantage of the instant download to my Amazon Cloud. The best of all worlds.....
B0029O08WA|5.0|This CD is awesome, like the movie.  It has such creative, fun and beautiful selection of songs. I would recommend to others.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Since Hearing about the debut of their new album and actually flying to Germany to see them on their European Tour before the North American Tour is obvious that I'm a devoted Fan and will always be.  The music has such a deeper and personal sound and really gives the band a much finer tuned piece of art that is music to my ears.
014241543X|1.0|I really thought this book would be interesting. I failed to relate to any of the characters, and I also failed to like them. The parents really turned me off; who knowingly lets their teenage daughter go have sex with her boyfriend up in her bedroom??? Anyway...<br /><br />If it weren't for the every-other-chapter flashbacks, this wouldn't be a terribly awful read. The flashbacks are so boring and make the book go by so slowly. I cannot finish this book, and I don't feel like I'm missing anything anyway. It's so obvious what's going to happen.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Great CD. If you like Neil Young, Traffic, Bonnie Raitt or the Allman Brothers, this is music to make your heart sing.
0375842209|4.0|This is a good test of a great book vs. a good book: remembering the story & the characters long after you have finished reading the book. The Book Thief's author paints vivid pictures of the main characters including it's unusual narrator, 'Death'.<br />Don't let the first few pages deter you. The opening pages are odd. But then the book launches into the life of a young girl named Liesel who living with foster (sort of) parents in pre-WW II Germany. This is a story written about people who hold onto humanity in spite of being in the midst of inhumane events. There is often dark humor and matter-of-fact telling of incidents that keeps the novel from being 'preachy'. I couldn't put the book down.
B00E8939CA|5.0|She is extremely talented and the music reminds me of the music from my family reunions growing up. Both of us being from the South, I love it....
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|'Lookout' scanned and identified this app as adware, immediately. Such a shame, looks like it'd be a nice looking alarm clock.
1607102110|5.0|i would highly recommend buying these books if you want a nice library . books are going out of fashion, these are great to collect!! covers are beautiful!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I can watch this over and over- My daughter and I are great Dr. Who fans- what more can I say?
B00AMB7VG8|5.0|The album is a really Purple's style. Hard rock with great songs ! Long live Deep Purple ! Long live Rock !
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I absolutely love this game and it's challenges, the storyline is not too bad either. I can't wait for a second one if they ever put one out.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A beautiful story of a life well lived.  It gives one a real sense of Indian life.  You will enjoy it.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade II is an awesome action packed vampire movie. It is based on the Marvel Comic created by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan.  This movie is awesome fun. I love everything about it. The action scenes are super entertaining, and the vampires are badass and scary.  Wesley Snipes and Ron Perlman are super cool, and Guillermo Del Toro directs this movie awesomely.  This is a superb action film and I highly recommend it.
B0065V2ISA|5.0|The album shows the quality, beat and melodies in the best of New Order's electronic dance music style. Even it does not become a best seller or never reaches the top of the parades the album Lost Sirens is one more great record from this super band ! Enjoy it !
0789723107|3.0|It's a classic. No one denies this. It was ground-breaking back when Krug published it at the turn of the century. These days, advice to use tabs to organize the content of a web site, and an implication that using DHTML is impossible falls flat.<br /><br />Toward the back of the book, there is some good advice on how to start doing your Usability Testing. However, you can safely ignore everything else -- page upon page of &#34;improving&#34; site usability did not age well. This book is best appreciated as pivotal historically, and recognized for its influence rather than its continuing relevance.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really enjoy this game, though it is a little hard for my 6 year old daughter, whom I assume it was geared towards.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|and Delicious. I would select this as an afternoon movie with your significant other. Michael is amazing as always!! Love him
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Good entertainment with action, romance and a twist in the story line that surprised me. I'm not a Tom Cruise fan but this was enjoyable.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|What can I say...if you like Halestorm, you will like this CD. There are a few more slow songs than the others, but it still a great album.
B005ZUR724|1.0|dumb i bought it a long time ago and u have to pay every month its just dumb...........other than that its a great game..&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;jfjeisjrjsksndjsjjdkskdjdoskdldpeleofndj
0763621803|5.0|This was our first introduction to Charlie and Lola.  The kids (3 and 5) both love this book, and we have purchased additional Charlie and Lola books because of this one.  Cute story and interesting illustrations.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are pretty flat, could be bassier - but these aren't your everyday consumer headphones for iPod consumption. They've got huge comfortable ear cups. I loved my first pair so much, I bought another. Comfort of these far surpasses any on-ear headphones. No discomfort from long listening sessions, or tracking. Works great as a guitarist because you can hear the amp through the semi-open cans. Yes you could monitor the guitar tracks, but it just doesn't replicate the same feel of playing, if you track in the same room. Vocal tracking is the same way, a greater sense of the room with open cans.<br /><br />If you're like me, and your left ear cuts out a lot and did some Googling for answers, you found these have a notorious problem (after prolonged use over the years) where the soldering in the left cup can lift. Random cut outs are quite annoying, especially after dropping retail years ago to buy these brand new. No amount of rotating, jiggling, or bending will get it to stay for the remainder of the listening session. So I contacted AKG support, and they said it would be $65 to ship/repair. At that point I placed an order for these (sold for $82.50 at the time) and fixed my other pair by re-soldering the wires. A bit of handy-work and now I have two pairs that work famously.<br /><br />These are such a great sub-$100 buy for anybody who wants to wrap music around your head.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a simple, easy to use calculator. It has never frozen up, or caused any problems for me. I recommend it.
0743435753|5.0|I recently discovered the &#34;Honorverse&#34; and am now hooked. This is exactly the kind of book I love reading. A tough, unique female lead, large spaceships blowing each other up...that's all I need to be sold. Everything else is garnish for me. It also happens to be written well, which helps a lot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Better than I expected.  Keeps you entertained trying to find the various items needed to escape to the next room.  Not too tough, but challenging in some places.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is done very well, you don't get stuck in one place and can't get out.The hints are very helpful.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I went back and started at the beginning with season 1.  Glad I did.  Great characters developed...good and clever writing.  Love Maggie Smith. Looking forward to season 4.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|What a story!!!!<br />I was hesitant at first about reading a book that had abuse in it but since I have read some of Jill Sanders other books I thought I would suck it up and give it a try and I can honestly say I was not disappointed. I think Jill did a great job portraying the emotional side of domestic abuse not just the physical side of it.<br /><br />Megan went to Pride, Oregon after her brother Matt was killed in an accident. She was suppose to visit him right before his accident but put it off because she had a broken arm and bruises that she didn't want her brother to see. Once she is in Pride for the funeral for her brother she is filled with guilt that she put off yet another visit because of the abuse that she was suffering from.<br />At the funeral she meets all of Matt's friends and neighbors that she has never met before and is overcome with fear about anyone figuring out her secrets.<br />Todd is Matt's best friend, business partner and neighbor. He hasn't had an easy go of things either with loosing both his wife and unborn daughter to cancer several years before he hasn't dated anyone and felt dead inside.<br />The friendship grows between Megan and Todd and its really sweet to watch how they both overcome their pasts to begin a future together.
B0018OFN4U|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this because Dawn of the Dead was supposedly &#34;funny,&#34; too... However, having someone coax me into watching it was a very good thing :) The characters are all so lovably irritating and the ending was actually surprising. Can't wait to see The World's End :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The is so much fun. I love it so much.<br />You learn so much. It is my favorite game ever.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Love it! Our 18 month old dughter goes crazy for this movie. The music and colors that they used are perfect. Great family movie, I even find myself singing along
0525478817|1.0|Went in expecting this amazing love story that triumphed through sickness and loss, and it fell flat for me.  I was hoping to laugh and cry like all the reviews I had read, but finished the book by doing neither.  Usually I prefer the book to the movie, however on this one I have a feeling the movie will be able to draw me in more than the writing did.  That is, if I pay to even go see it.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|This was a good read with an intriguing storyline. I always enjoy reading historical novels and this was book was exceptional in that  the characters were so real, and there interaction with each so believable it felt as though you knew them personally or could identify similarities within your own family members.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book was a great find.  I rented it in the Lending Library and I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good thrill.  The book keeps you interested and then at the end pulls a 180 and reveals what really is going on.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I didn't expect a history lesson or running lessons, anthropology, or one of the biggest scams put on the world (Nike). Good read!
159463176X|4.0|If you are a fan of Hosseini's writing, you will like how this story starts, about ten-year-old Abdullah, who is young and motherless and from a poor family and village in Afghanistan.  How he watches his stoic but desperate father sell Abdullah's baby sister Pari to a wealthy Afghan from Kabul.  \\"A finger had to be cut, to save the hand,\\" just as in the book's opening tale of Baba Ayub and the div.  This is the central event that shapes the lives of Abdullah, Pari and their families for nearly sixty years.  Hosseini chronicles these lives as the characters struggle with loss and emptiness and the feeling of being helplessly trapped in lives and situations that evolve over time.<br /><br />A great deal of Hosseini's early narrative takes place in Abdullah's village of Shadbagh, then in Kabul and later in Paris.  The storyline eventually expands to include characters from Tinos, Greece and California.  It's interesting to see how Hosseini develops this large cast of characters and storylines and then ultimately ties many of them together.<br /><br />Its epic proportions, however, become its weakness, as characters are introduced through different formats and narratives, which are not necessarily confusing, but somewhat distracting.  In addition, some characters draw attention and sympathy and are later lost in the story, never to be fully explained.  For example, the story of Parwana's twin sister Masooma seems to be important, but I'm left wondering why.  Maybe it's about the conflict between duty and breaking free.  Likewise, I think the side story of Idris and Timur, their return to Kabul and of the injured Roshi is excellent, but its conclusion is not satisfying.<br /><br />I think the author does a great job with Pari's life and of Nila, Mr. Wahdati and Nabi.  To me, these are the most interesting and tragic relationships in the whole book and there is a lot to think about here.<br /><br />I also think the story of Iqbal and his son Gholam and their disgust as they return to Shadbagh is moving and raw.  I wanted to know more about Adel and his friendship to Gholam.  I wanted to see how Adel handled his new understanding of his father the Commander.  But Hosseini drops that story.  Maybe he does it to show how some things are never fixed and therefore remain raw.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Markos Vavaris' character and think his drive to help the severely injured and disfigured citizens in Kabul shows how people from other parts of the world do feel strongly about the injustices that people in Afghanistan have suffered.  I also liked reading about his relationship to his mother.  I'm not sure why the author develops this storyline so much, particularly the relationship between Markos and Thalia and Thalia's mother Madaline, except for the obvious reference to Thalia's disfigurement, but I liked getting to know them.  I wonder if Hosseini is showing us the challenges of family ties from other cultures to broaden the emotions of his story.<br /><br />There is plenty of symbolism in this book and I like that kind of tie-in.  The feathers, the oak tree, the color yellow, Mr. Wahdati's rusted-out car and Pari's sense of longing when she sees a red wagon.  References like this make the story seem whole and to me that is quality writing.<br /><br />Maybe some will find the ending dissatisfying.  I did not.  Without spoiling things, I will say that the reunions, new connections and hopeful beginnings end the story with a nice feeling of optimism.<br /><br />I give it four stars because I do not think it's as good as The Kite Runner and I think I need to re-read A Thousand Splendid Suns to make a complete comparison.hey return to Shadbagh is moving and raw.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey while traveling, and it pulled me into watching all three seasons when I got home. Very well done.
B00COO2D6O|3.0|A nice follow up to the first game. Solid game play, nice improvements.<br />Cool new units, better system to get more stars.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Thought for sure that I would be sort of Meh on this book....totally blown away.  Funny, Insightful, and surprising.  Very well written!  Word of warning, it's a collection of stories that are put together and not a free-flowing action book.  Told in past tense as a recounted history.  Awesome Book!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Game play is easy and moves at a good pace. It is nice to build what you want yet still have help with what is needed.
1401938906|5.0|Great ideas, wise advice, easy reading that truly stays with you, original and super funny! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is ready to read material that you haven't heard and will not put you to sleep.
B0065AVS0K|5.0|The main characters supernatural ability to resist pain and injury is an unexpected and surprising story element for first time viewers. Very Good!
B009MYARIK|4.0|No life-changing by any means. But a fun read nonetheless. Missing a little of the trademark Kinsella irreverence. I was not laughing out loud with this one like I was with all of her others. Recommend for a beach read!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I Love this show! It's perfect to watch for a nice day inside! It's interesting, fun, magical and mysterious. I'm happy with it.
B000AP04MO|4.0|This film shows the unhappy marriage of two people who really do love each other.  Audery Hepburn is always a joy to watch-one of the ladies both men and women never tire of watching.  Albert Finney is also a very good actor.  The film is tedious to watch at times-it is not enjoyable to watch a couple fight the length of a movie.  At the end of the movie both characters realize they love each other and are better off  living with the other's flaws than alone.  Something that often happens in real life.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Amazing show, but it made me sad in season 3. The series is tremendously well done, and I really enjoyed receiving it with Amazon Prime.
1401307787|3.0|I liked the book but I think the book would fit for somebody who is not really \\"disturbed\\" maybe just stressed. When I say \\"disturbed\\" I mean somebody who has suffered with anxiety and or mild depression or any other mental stress that is more bothering then just plain stress from daily life's events.<br />In this book, Jon is trying to advise people to \\"just observe without judging\\" all of their thoughts , without giving any emotions to any of them. While that is fine sometimes I believe that \\"disturbing thoughts\\" or upsetting obsessive thinking NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGED AND JUDGE , SEEN AS WHAT THEY ARE AND DISMISSED.<br />I found the book by Jeffrey Schwarts \\" You are not your brain\\" to be helpful and life changing and also all the books by Albert Ellis. If you have anxiety, depression or any other mental stress please read Albert Ellis and Jeffrey Schwarts, they changed my life more then Jon Kabat because I am a rational person who likes proofs, facts  and down to earth methods to make sense of my real problems.<br />I would recommend reading this book after the books I mentioned above.<br /><br />UPDATE: 10/16/2013<br /><br />I finally found my cure for my problems ALL OF THEM. My problems were caused by  low magnesium, iron vitamin B12 and vitamin D. All my symptoms are GONE. I do not feel anxious/crazy/disturbed...you name it..please look into mineral deficiencies and vitamins before you spend $$$$ on books on end with wisdom but not a cure. Thank you magnesium for saving my life!!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It is a fun game, though the in-app market is designed so that you cannot really progress unless you happen to spend a good bit of (real) .money on.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love the New Girl!  Smart, Funny, and I can't get enough of every single one of em'!  I am late to this part but so glad to be here now!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great British series with characters and intrigue. Thank you for making Downton Abbey available, Amazon Prime! This show is really interesting and compelling.
B003B02O0A|3.0|Compared to all of Grisham's stuff, this one is obviously a first book.  Amateurish although a decent plot, too talky,  too descriptive. Not enough meat! His other stuff is so great, this just really falls short!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Very addictive book, difficult to put down. Am watching the series at the same time, but there is so much detail in the books (as usual). Looking forward to the next one.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game to play if you enjoy mahjong. Even for kids learning to match, hours of fun. Looking for a challenge, try getting stars for finishing in under 5,6 or 7 min
0062124293|5.0|Some females need this book. It can be helpful if they want to get along with a man. Good luck.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Instructions not clear. I started trying to play with what turned out to be the not so interactive instructions. I'm still not sure how I got past that. The game changes from Chinese charters to Greek which makes things interesting as you progress. Did not see a lot of ads. Game seems to use more power than some other apps. I'm still trying to figue out how I earn some of the icons that show up after each match.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Good story, some weird bits but overall a good story. Gentle humour and although an incredible adventure, it was written in a way which never made me scared, or disgusted despite the frightening and disgusting issues he faced. A story which stays with you when you are not reading the book. Keeps you thinking about the story teller and what happens like.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good characters. I liked the thoughts about what might have been at the end. True to life story. I liked it.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|It is the 2nd worst movie that I have ever seen.  Acting was terrible, plot was terrible, script was terrible, etc...
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This holder has a nice look, is sturdy and well padded.  It automatically turns off the kindle when closed and on when opened.  The stand is very handy and nice to have when reading..
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Fans of David Tennant in Dr. Who will enjoy his brooding and dark portrayal of Alec Hardy. His character reminds me of the tardis in his former role: &#34;bigger on the inside&#34;. At first closed and cold, we learn that his hard exterior hides a vulnerable core. I look forward to future episodes and the solution to the mystery.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Well written, wonderfully informative, spiritually challenging, and intellectually engaging. I enjoyed this book from page to page, cover to cover.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun for all ages. syncs to my face book. but no offline option to play. plays better on my kindle then my phone<br />but hey it is free.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Definitely worth reading. Loved the unique writing style used
B0091WNK8M|4.0|How can you go wrong with a movie like the Goonies?  I am trying to get my son to watch something other than the &#34;buddies&#34; movies, and this was a great choice!
B006903GX8|5.0|I can not wait for the next season to be on CD.  It is much better watching it on our time and being able to view the entire series without waiting.  Even my husband is watching this one!
B00003CXP1|5.0|What a great movie. Not for everyone though. Starts off great and then slowly descends into the darkness of drugs and addiction. You do get to see 2 ocsar winners and some great acting.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It's safe fun enjoyable. Cute little animals kids love it so much especially me niece. She is 4 about I think.
B00AAZSH0U|5.0|Sandra Boynton books are usually great! After number one chewed up the cardboard ones, we bought the Kindle version for number two!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I am enjoying this series very much.  After falling in love with Downton Abby I thought I would give this series a try and while it is similar the timeline is different and I am very interested in the characters.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This was a gift and they loved it. I didn't think it was all that. It felt trendy and not solid enough to last any amount of time.
B0093LINVK|1.0|As with many other people, I was very excited at the prospect of using this as a tiny solution for playing all my movies and music on my HDTV/home theater setup.  This is great execution form-wise--compact, quiet, generally runs cool, and still very powerful given what it gives up.<br /><br />The problem is that Intel's driver support renders this thing unusable for its biggest potential user base: those of us using XBMC for media management.  For nearly 6 months now, the built-in Intel graphics for this have not worked with XBMC.  There are tons of posts about this on the Intel NUC forums, but despite knowing about the problem, Intel still hasn't made it a priority to solve.<br /><br />If you search around, there are lots of tweaks and hacks and betas that *might* help fix your Intel NUC graphics actually work.  But for that same amount of searching, you can find a much better product that actually has a team that will support issues that might crop up with their products.  Buyer beware.
0385738765|5.0|This book was for my son who is currently reading the series. He loves the story line and the book came in perfect condition. Great deal!!
B007XC9BSK|4.0|I like that this serves as storage for my son's microdrifter cars, as well as something he can play with.
1593272839|5.0|Fundamental concept about Haskell: higher order function, functor, type classes are clearly explained. Although you can't learn functional programming skills by this book, but for Haskell language, this book is enough. There are some humor in this book, some people might not appreciate it(but I do), but it won't confuse you, you can ignore them without missing anything about Haskell. The pictures made by author is very funny, too.<br /><br />Functors and monads are actually from category theory, you should check it out if you like the concept. Monoid is from abstract algebra, read a good abstract algebra book would help a lot if you are a computer science student. Standard CS in college only mention abstract algebra in discrete math course, which is not enough.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|This case is beautiful and a perfect fit.. Many people have complained that the Flip part does not stay attached to screen but ..<br />if you talk like an hour by folding flip backside, there will be a half inch gap between screen and flip (it does not fall right on screen) .. and if you place the phone upside down or place phone in pocket.. with an hour the flip stays right on screen (in time it will stay on screen).. it doesnot  have magnet but still i think 25 bucks is worth the case ..
B0058VW36U|4.0|My grandson, age 7, really enjoyed this game.<br />It was right up his alley and worked well on the Kindel
B004H4XAXO|5.0|One of the best built fantasy worlds I've ever read about. The characters are engaging, the battles exciting and the pace is excellently maintained.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this for my three year old as well as myself.  The graphics are great. It is really enjoyable.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I got this on one of the deal for the day specials and it was a heck lot cheaper than going to best buy
B000002ADT|5.0|I LIKE LISTENING TO SMOOTH JAZZ.  THIS CD GAVE ME EXACTLY WHAT A WANTED, WHEN I AM SITTING IN TRAFFIC, POP IN THE CD SMOOTH SAILING ALL THE WAY HOME.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown overcame more crippling adversity in many aspects of his life. Perseverance seemed his hallmark. Inspirational. Truly made me question why I've taken such an easy path in life.  Many good books have been written about the SEAL experience. &#34;Fearless&#34; goes beyond that.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like all the options. Works fine for kindle fire. I did have a glitch, but it was my kindle not the app. I would recommend it.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell 's book is a fascinating collection of root causes. There are a multitude of answers to questions that I had never thought to ask. Malcolm Gladwell explores the roots of success to a depth that I never would have considered without provocation. I really enjoyed this book. I look forward to enjoying many new aha moments as I read the other books written by Mr. Gladwell. I had selected this book in hopes of discovering some recipe that I might employ to foster the interests of my children. I had hoped to discover the formula for helping to cultivate/ foster their ultimate success. This book did a great deal to inform my thinking. I do hope for a perfect storm of unique opportunities for each of them, but my strongest hope still remains their ultimate health and happiness. Thank you, Mr. Gladwell for the heaping mouthful of food for thought.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't read a book this engrossing for ages. Great story, wonderful characters, and a very believable world that it takes place in. It hurt every time I had to set it down and participate in the real world.<br />This author renews my faith in sci-fi.<br /><br />Just...<br /><br />Wow!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, will definitely be purchasing this author's other books. I was praying they would meet again.....
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Just downloaded on kindle fire.  So far no issues, first page does show all the games this developer offers, no biggie, just hit play button.  Currently playing story mode, first game is a walk through, which was very helpful. I like it.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This was agreat movie.It made you wonder how careless you can be in times stress  .We are not perfect.  mbans
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had heard this book is dirty. It is not dirty. I loved it. Love conquers all. Highly recommend to all.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|I cannot believe all the hype over this book.  I thought it was a big waste of my<br />time.  Had a really dumb ending.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like falling asleep to rain so on those sad days when its not raining I have an alternative. yayyy!!! :D
B009R659L8|4.0|this is a typical who done it. I like all the different characters<br />she uses. Mary Higgins is one of my favorite authors.<br />Sometimes I can identify who it is and sometimes I get a<br />surprise and I'm wrong.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Most thought provoking book, I cannot condone euthanasia but through all the sadness a heart warming story. Patience and tolerance, kindness and understanding is what we need when we deal with a person who is handicapped.
B004529NKC|5.0|I bought number four and so decided I needed the whole set and these where priced right so that I would have them available when my granddaughters and I want to have a marathon night.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I down loaded it and installed it but if i try to play it takes me to my home screen. ={ i really wish this would get fixed.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This has already been a FAoTD. I think it is a good game but there are too many adds. Thanks for reading.
B000FC130E|4.0|It was a pretty good read, but I wasn't able to get into the plot as much as I should have. The main character has no idea whats going on for the entire book, as a result I was pretty lost. It didn't feel like we were working through the mystery
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I bought number four and so decided I needed the whole set and these where priced right so that I would have them available when my granddaughters and I want to have a marathon night.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far it's fun nd challenging enough that I have yet to be bored with it<br />Like the fact I can zoom in to see items better
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Awesome game very addictive but the suits look completely different when your playing then when your looking at them in the menu so plz fix that otherwise great game
B000031WD9|5.0|oh it was a great movie!  I watched it so many years ago, so nice to watch it again with friends.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It's not all theory, but challenges you to try things out for yourself. It helps you to look differently at life.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I've actually seen this before but I streamed it again to test my monitor. Great resolution.<br />I liked the film because they took the time to develop the background story as opposed to a cursory development and then a jump into too many action sequences.<br />I love a good sci-fi story which I think this is. Haven't read the books though I understand they are much better.
0452289963|5.0|If you can give this as a gift, I highly recommend that you do.  It will help transform the world.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Guy Clark is music history walking. I have been fortunate to see him perform live on multiple occasions and he is one of the most prolific songwriters of the folk/Americana genre. I recommend this CD.. and all other CDs he has released in his lifetime.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Graphics were Great and the story line reachable.  The HD version was superb and would have been even better in 3-D.  Left us feeling very good!
0307454568|5.0|The third book in Stieg Larsson's &#34;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; series is simply amazing. I couldn't put this book down. It is an appropriate conclusion to the series, and the plot kept my attention from the first page. I loved the previous two books, too, but this one really highlights Larsson's exceptional writing, plot / character development, and dramatic storyline. I cannot recommend this book enough!
1577314808|5.0|If you can give this as a gift, I highly recommend that you do.  It will help transform our world.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Read it - it is important for all (women, men, young and old). So much you already know because you have felt the same - so much you didn't, but which makes sense.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This was a classic Nicholas Sparks story. Well written and easy to read. But, the ending was more predictible than some of his other novels. Not my favorite of his, but I still enjoyed it.
0060930349|5.0|Johnson is wackily right-wing, but he's also a brilliant writer who seems to have read everything and formed an opinion on everything. I've loved most of his books. His opinions are often too conservative to be offensive. For example, he asserts that our most admirable recent president was Calvin Coolidge. He believes Hoover had dangerously radical ideas and Roosevelt was positively Stalinist. Read him anyway.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I think if this were a free app it would be a bit more accessible to be over run with ads. If you pay for the app it's usually so you can enjoy an ad-free game. The adventure in the game is fun though so I overlooked the ads and gave it 5 stars
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Referred to by friends , and it is a detailed account of his time in war an  the struggles he faced back home.  He was a true warrior and a man's man.  I am jealous of his life!!!  Well parts of it, anyway.
B008220BLG|5.0|I saw it twice at the shows.  It's a warm and fuzzy, romantic zombie movie with a good ending and a lot of humor throughout.  Very entertaining and well done.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a very good work of literature. It is told in a unique voice by an unlikely narrator. It kept me reading long into the night. Highly recommend.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|it followed the novel qite well.  looked like it was actually filmed in bath.  good acting, and good  story. i am happy with it
B000QFQE4U|5.0|I am a Spike Lee movie collector.  Everytime I watch one of Mr. Lee's movies, I learn something else about the subject of his movies.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I took this book on a trip with me to Nepal while I headed out for service work.  It was a great read!  It's one of those books you don't want to put down because you want to see what happens next.  It was such a great read!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy the game but wish there were options to chose game variations such as being able to fill a blank row with any card rather than just a king.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is super fun and I like this game it's amazing if u ever see this game u should download it and play it you will like this game all u need to do Is give it a try
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|It's enough of a challenge to keep the kids amused for extended periods, and will get dad hooked too.  The quality of the graphics is well above the standard of that other flying animals game
B006G3JQ78|4.0|Love this movie! Great songs.It is a classic.  Everyone in our family has a different favorite scene.  You can't go wrong with this. Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are fantastic.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|One of the greatest author of our time. You can miss this one. Precious. Evil, suspense, good humor. A lot of surprises.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this for the kids and they love all the songs.  It is tolerable for me, but I would not be their targeted audience.
1439181780|5.0|This is such a good book! The book is &#34;nonreligious&#34; but the whole concept and idea is Christian based and I love it. A lot of people like it because it is not faith based and the only thing that doesn't make it that way is that it doesn't say &#34;God&#34; or &#34;Jesus.&#34; It is about a lot of believing and so is Christianity.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this every day for a variety of different reasons, from timing things that I have in the oven to reminding me to take medications..
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Hadn't seen the Doctor Who series in a VERY long time and didn't realize that it was still &#34;going strong&#34;.  I watched in black and white on a smaller screen then we have these days and the special effects compared to today was not that wonderful.  Now that I have been reintroduced to the series, I am definitely hooked on him again!..Love it and will be trying to catch up to the current series as soon as I can.
B00123MCGE|5.0|both the DVD and CD. its just...man...how beautifully amazing this is and foREVer will be. i just wish i could find &#34;Raise The Knife&#34; by itself as a MP3 or by itself on iTunes. so, i can buy it.

B002DQNH54|5.0|ok. look. A LOT of people will disagree with me, but, to me, this is MY favorite Slipknot album (Yes, i still say &#34;album&#34;, lmao, its a habit from my &#34;sperm donor dad&#34;. anyways, back to MIGHTY numbers as a collective unit - RIP Paul Gray - this to me is their darkest. yes, &#34;IOWA&#34; is their most angry and fun filled album, but, for personal reasons, this is their best and my favorite. why? i love the production. its raw and gritty. and the lyrics are more darker and in your face.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless is the compelling story of Adam Brown, from severe addiction to honored SEAL.  His faith in God, his wifes courage and belief in him as a person along with Eric Blehm's writing talent make it a great read.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Its good stress release I play it all the time. I have made it to 2 suites but 3 suites is quite the challenge.
B001AXNH92|5.0|look. as the classic lineup, they could do no wrong. all of the albums with James as vocalist, there is NOT one song, i do NOT like. these guys with Mike Portnoy were beyond greatness and this shows why. i just wish the DVD had all of the extra performances like the CD has. but, hey, you cant get what you always want.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Grisham's latest installment of his young adult series Theodore Boone hits a home run. Theo helps save his friends family farm by standing up against politicians and builders and \\"thugs\\" that beat and badly injured his dog, Judge. I loved it and can't wait for the next book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This isn't a very hard game to play. It is a little bit addictive too. The game play is flawless so far on my nexus 7.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is fun and easy to play only wish could play more at one time without purchasing more content. Has me coming back everyday
B005544V6A|5.0|Amazing show - smart and witty. The fashionable and good looking actors doesn't hurt either. Hooked after the first episode!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A book that brings you into the battle field in words as opposed to pictures or films . This book takes you on the road the author traveled to end up as a sniper in Iraq. Graphic descriptions of how the &#34;art&#34; of sniping is accomplished in the heat of battle and the dangers that come with putting yourself in that arena . It also brings to the reader the strong bond formed in battle between these mostly invisible gladiators on the battle field. This book has a very powerful American view of the war and leaves the political intricacies to other authors. It also gives the view which is very unusual in a war book of how the relationships one has on the home front are affected ,be that a wife or family .
B008YKGQR4|3.0|When I first downloaded full facebook, it took forever to be able to sign in. I kept getting a message that it wasn't responding. It did eventually work and is better than m.facebook.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This movie really helps you appreciate what our founding fathers went through for the sake of this great nation. Your whole family will enjoy it.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Just an overall nice easy read. I love the continuous storyline and the characters. Just a great read for anyone looking to dive into a new book/series.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Rey really outdid herself.... Been listening to every songs nonstop. Love, love, love! Can't wait to see what her future will be.
0062255657|5.0|Fantasy, fun, such imagination.  I enjoyed the twists of the book.  Sentences and structure are not even looked at as you rip through this book.
1781161313|5.0|Some years back I sought a copy of the colonial marines tech manual but everything I found was an out of print book that were pushing over 100 bucks so I resigned myself to never getting ahold of one. My luck held when the publisher started offering a reprint of the original. Its very good quality paper first off and I'm pleased with it its exactly the same as the original and I'm pleased to have it in my collection as a sci ti buff
B0067Q42BY|4.0|It's a fun game but it's a little hard to remember which tiles pair with any of the tiles and unless you use a stylist pen you can hit the wrong tiles and its a little bit slower then I would like it to be
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A gripping story that kept me focused on the book to the end. Recommend it for all science fiction readers.
1846554071|4.0|I am actually reviewing the hardback edition with all three books (same cover as above). Murakami's imagination and ability to weave together so many different strands without losing the reader is quite amazing. While the story itself is drawn from different planes and even different parallel worlds, the actual expression of the story does not belong completely to the fantasy genre, nor is it just a thriller or a romance: it is a mixture of all three and even more. I really enjoyed 1Q84; my only critical remark would be that, with Book Three, it is, perhaps, just a little too long.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book! If I didn't have to go to bed right now I would start it right now!
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Really enjoyed the tempo and detail. The author has the ability to keep your attention and to wonder: 'What next'
B004EPYZUS|5.0|loved this one . so very glad there working on another as we speak. tom cruise sure knew what he was doing taking over on the mission impossible products.
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|Joe's soulful voice can brings anyone to there knees, he is always so good and always brings it every time I would say run out and get this one.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I loved this movie. My bf had never seen it, so I had to watch it with him. He loved it too!
B000AP04OM|5.0|A movie that will always capture the heart of any feeling person. And the second disc show the love they had for being part of it. from Fred.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Originally GRRM meant to skip both A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons.  He wanted about a few year time jump between A Storm of Swords and what would have been the fourth book, and this fourth book would have flashbacks to the events that took place in between.  At the end of the day, it became a difficult mess, and GRRM decided to scratch this idea and instead write the events that would have needed flashbacks...and a lot of cushion since not enough actually happened to warrant one book let alone two originally.  This book feels drawn out.  I knew this was possibly the case going in since I already knew the above information and previously read a Feast for Crows.  Personally, A Feast For Crows is better.  The problem this book suffers from in addition to the tedium of the previous book, is finally getting some of the main characters on screen and not liking them so much.  Without giving away spoilers: Tyrion appears cruel and sometimes his storyline borders on the side of the ridiculous, though he still has great and memorable lines; while Dany becomes incompentant and shown lacking in Westeros culture and history, and no real desire to remedy this situation.  Arya's storyline was still good, still dark, and interesting.  Jon Snow's storyline while it drags on at the beginning, finally feels like it may end up in an interesting position by the end of the book.  The Reek POV is too disturbing for me to read, but for those that can actually get through it without wanting to scrub your brain, it is probably GRRM best writing in the entire book and a thing of brillance.  Those that have weak stomaches however, would be much better skipping it all together and looking up what happens (honestly not that much that wasn't told by previous POVs or guessed at, it's more about the shaping of the POV).<br /><br />All in all, if this was the first book I read in ASOIAF, it would be my last.  However, I stuck with it since there are two more books in the series to come out, and they will probably be back in the vein of the previous books, since they aren't really created to fill in gaps of time.  So I do in fact recommend this book, because I am sure the rest of the series will be quite a ride, and only time will tell if your favorites actually make it out of the series alive if battered.
B00DMM3WVM|2.0|My son figured out a way around the parental-control settings on his kindle & downloaded this. NOT APPROPRIATE for pre-teens. At least, not by my standards. It's gone now, and I re-set the password on his kindle.  So There!<br /><br />This is probably a fun game for adults or older teens.  Just not kids...
B00846WWVM|4.0|Its a good game to enjoy with your kids, They really love it and just don't stop from playing again and again.
B0053O89XI|3.0|Love the Big Bang theory. But it was sent to me broken and the discs were all smudged and very dirty. Easy fix however just wish that want the case. Great series though ! (:
B0009P66TK|5.0|I love this watch.  It's well build and looks great.  It's big and makes a bold statement without being too flashy.  The price is very reasonable for a watch like this one.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Very I spiring and good parts and bad parts. It was a real come from behind movie, I guess the little guy wins in the end.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|This is a great CD. I have had several friends listen to it and they all agree. If you like Lynyrd Skynyrd and  The Black Crows, you'll love this CD. It's some of the best pure music to come out in a long time!
B00594XOZU|3.0|California girl, looking for adventure. I'm a photographer, music lover, great at conversations and being a chill person.  Hit me up
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Bossypants is absolutely hysterical but really lets the reader know who Tina Fey is.  While it was all new to me I was happy to find that she is exactly as I expected her to be and I wish she was my best friend--what a BLAST that would be!!!
B00EEDJM2Q|2.0|only pick this game to play due to sewing . maybe try again. right now no not interested no fun
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome... book I loved it can`t wait to read book two and three... one of the best love stories Ive read
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is one of the greatest tv show i ever seen. Makes other zombies movies like craps. Highly recommend it to anyone. I can not wait for season 4.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|found this game very captivating required close attention and speed to complete required task to over come each level.  liked very much
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love playing this game .I've been playing this game since 2days ago.It  challenges you to think and I love that about this game. I probably won't stop playing instill I beat it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't have much to say beyond the title. It starts out simple enough and you can get very cocky but it does get challenging in a good way.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it very addictive once u get the hang of it, hopefully it lets me play past level 10 after this review.......that's the only bad part if it doesn't.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|No, really.  I definitely love this show.  I Watched all 10 seasons, and my only disappointment is that it's over.
B008KH3XHW|1.0|This product is really cheap and does not hold an iPhone.  The arm that holds the phone broke off while we were trying to put the phone in it and now the product is useless.  I would not purchase this product as it is poorly constructed.  I suppose you get what you pay for on this product.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was interesting enough that it kept me wanting to read it, but it was kinda boring at times.  Also I would have liked to know a little bit about her life after her release.  Things like how easy or difficult was it, even how long til she got married.
B00AEBBADG|3.0|Haven't watched the movie but very disappointed in the quality of the CD case, hoping the movie is great quality.
B0094KT8W8|1.0|This is an inferior movie. I had seen it on free TV.  I wondered how it got on my Kindle. Suggest  Amazon.com require your password to confirm a purchase from your Kindle. If you must see it, wait till it is shown again on free TV. It's definetly not worth the purchase price of almost $20.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's a cool game. It's fun entertaining and a good way on the kindle to pass the time. I like the story and the action. Just sucks that I'm low on diamond  to buy stuff and I'm broke.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|your site cut me off halway and i GAVE UP. i woke up the next morning and couldnt finish it....
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I absolutely love Diamond Dash.  I play on facebook everyday.  This game is a challenge to see how many gems you can destroy in 60 seconds.  I play with a few friends and we send each other &#34;lives&#34; as you need a supply of &#34;lives&#34; to play.
B005TVYVI2|5.0|The product arrived on time, was adequately packed and is giving me just what I need - beeps to time my strokes. It is easy to use, unlikely to get lost under my swimming cap and looks exactly as in the website. I hope it continues as is.
B00122N0MU|5.0|This album was definitely NOT a disappointment!  I enjoy it so much that I am going to order another because I am sure I will wear this CD out!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and this allowed me to easily be on pinterest on my kindle. I'm so glad I found this it works much better than using the browser.
B00003CXAA|5.0|A great american movie classic. The acting was great. The story was great. What more needs to be said about it?
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I like everything about this product. For the money, it is well worth it.<br /><br />I regularly use this kit to work on anything from computers to Motorcycles. (Not the heavy stuff on the motorcycles but the electrical components)
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Unimaginable that any human being would have to endure this unlawful imprisonment for so long right under the nose of officials...for 18 yrs.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love any every Angry Birds game and this is right up there with all the others. I love to play to pass the time while I'm waiting.
0141002689|5.0|Out Fleming's Fleming in every possible way. Smart, visceral, real, his characters and prose cut to the quick of every scene. No filler. Every page a gut punch of what real looked like in our post-war cold war world.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|It was recommended to me with a warning; 'if you can just get through the beginning', you will really enjoy it.  You need the background in the beginning of the trilogy but it is so dry it is difficult to get through.  I trusted this person's opinion so I bought the CD to listen to the beginning while I drove to work and then read the remainder of the trilogy.  I have recommended to friends and they have all been more than satisfied.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is a great game for everybody that loves horses. You get to train it feed it and take care of it. And every horse needs to be cleaned up after.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I have kids, so I use timers for different things. This let's me save and organize my timers so I don't forget them all.

B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song is an AMAZING come back song for Gaga. It's fun and it makes me feel good every time! Finally, songs that are not just about love and sex.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I like the game but I don't like the fact that it is hard to get neighbors if you don't know people who play. Other than that fun game
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book is a must! Could not put it down! Definitely leaves you wondering what will happen next! The storyline with a twist is absolutely amazing!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I have watched all episodes many times, and I still enjoy them as much as the first time.  These are an instantaneous anti-depressant.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Loved the book and my brother told me about it very good want to pass this on to my..son and it inspired me about courage and what this man went though for his country and sacrifice and his God it a amazing me what all our soldiers have done for our country and God is a blessing .
B00ET47USI|4.0|This game is pretty fun. Much better than the simple original game. I like  that it gives the option to add more suits when I want it to be more difficult.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I don't know how the creators & writers of this show did it. They managed to create a TV show that has so many characteristics all at once. First and foremost, this show is chilling & scary, but it is also a drama with funny moments, thrilling turns, and sexy elements. I didn't think I would like it, but I was hooked after the first 15 minutes. Every episode is a surprise and provides backstory into the \\"Murder House\\" and into the characters. Oh, and the acting is SUPERB. I haven't seen TV acting on a level such as this, except maybe in AMC TV shows like The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad. This show is just so unique and unexpected. Watch it - you won't be disappointed!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazon constantly 'recommended' this book based on my purchase history and I've informed for almost a year. Really bad decision. I could've enjoyed this book so long ago and I missed out. Excellent characters and great pacing of the mysteries involved. I agree with Amazon and all the other five star ratings. Excellent story.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great app for all kindle owners,but it's really good for those of us who are retired and are trying to keep our brains active,we need more than reading books.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|An article I read over the weekend mentioned this film, 'The Devil Wears Prada', and I realized I needed to see it again. The marvelous Meryl Streep has made 'the devil we know', a good thing. My gosh, she's a misery to work for, but what you learn in the process!<br /><br />A young woud be journalist needs to support herself, and she interviews as Miranda's second assistant. Her honesty, intelligence and lack of fashion knowledge give her the edge and he lands the job. She doesn't understand he job, until Nigel, played by Stanley Tuci, as the magazine's fashion director explains it in terms Andrea understands. She changes her style and hair and becomes the job and the assistant Miranda wants. Unfortunately it changes her relationships, and life becomes difficult.<br /><br />We all had dreams as a child, I wanted to be a 'secret spy', I still read all the spy mysteries and thrillers, and had a great career, buti did not follow my dream, obstacles occurred, as they often do. Andrea realizes her dream for awhile, and then it comes undone. But life moves on and so does Andrea. Miranda remains the same, alas.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 09-03-13
0684857219|5.0|If you're new to bodybuilding or need more info on the proper forms, health and fitness, this book covers it all.  It may seem odd to those of us who never heard of Arnold Schwarzenegger having a book like this.  We found out about this book on bodybuilding.com as many fitness enthusiast, bodyspace users, and bodybuilders swear by this book.  This book has rave reviews and a good resource for  amateurs like us to professional bodybuilders, participants and champions. Easy to read and understand, materials are well organized.  My husband was happy to have received this book from me as a surprise.  He is getting beautiful muscle definitions that he never had before.  This book is so motivating and very engaging one can get pretty absorbed in all its highly interesting sections.  It's a must have book for learning about the body, nutrition, etc.  Yeah, he highly recommends this book!
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|Entertaining to play with simple yet enjoyable game play. It's a little difficult to get gold star (perfection) on each level but that only adds to the challenge. I'd like to see more levels as well, There simply is not enough and it's very easy and quick to work your way through the game.<br /><br />It's original though, I give it that, and it's entertaining. I'd recommend it but it's certainly not worth the 3 dollar price tag, It's a 1 dollar app at best imo.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is awesome!! I love to play this app some of them are hard some are easy either way it's fun
B004XWLN20|5.0|I bought this for my son and he loves it. Very impressed with the packaging. We are looking forward to spending many hours watching this series again, as well as seeing episodes that we missed over the years.
B00DHHWY9I|1.0|Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor, however in this movie he could not pull off the what Robert Reford did. The sound track was awful<br />total waste of money and time
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Your typical build game based off My Little Pony. It looks average, not good but not bad either, and the mini games add a little excitement to it. Overall however, It's just not my kind of game. It doesn't do enough to separate it from other similar apps.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|I didn't know what to expect but I love action movies so I gave it a try.  I love it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Having a good time playing this game. Challenging but still very fun! Great way to occupy my time and definitely not mind numbing!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This has been one of my favorite shows of all time.  Every time I try to guess what is going to happen I am wrong.  I have yet to be able to predict how the plot thickens or turns.  Very good
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a beautiful peaceful pass-time.  Lovely music, and a &#34;less is more&#34; approach make this little game satisfying on many levels.  Do try it.
B001F12J0C|5.0|All three movies were great and i loved getting all three in the same set.  Lots of action and Matt Damon is a good actor.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I purchased this as I had recently seen Red 2 at a local theater, and liked it.<br /><br />This one is great also !!  I would recommend it !!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy to read. Read the whole book in just four days. very entertaining. Also enjoyed the second and third book.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|Very intriguing story and beautifully shot movie. Rich character development and great period piece. This dark tale is a full sensory experience.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Awesome and creative game. Great role playing game. Level up, loot, and take on multiple enemy types. Thanks for the free game that keeps giving.
B000002KIQ|5.0|Ry Cooder. Jazz.<br />This 1978 jazz album is hard to categorize as to the type of jazz that it contains.  It is a mixed bag of old-time songs done on a variety of instruments that make the album sound like a collection from an earlier era of jazz. Here is a list of the songs on the album, and the types of music as I see them:<br />1.) Big Bad Bill Is Sweet William Now  (Ragtime/St. Louis Blues, - to the tune of \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\").<br />2.) Face To Face That I Shall Meet Him (Gospel/New Orleans Funeral March).<br />3.) The Pearls/Tia Juana (Tex-Mex/Spanish Guitar/Calypso).<br />4.) The Dream (Hawaiian).<br />5.) Happy Meeting In Glory (Gospel/New Orleans Funeral March).<br />6.) In A Mist (Big Band Swing/Waltz).<br />7.) Flashes (Tex-mex/Spanish Guitar).<br />8.) Davenport Blues (Blues).<br />9.) Shine (Minstrel/Broadway/Swing).<br />10.)  Nobody (Minstrel/Slow Drag).<br />11.)  We Shall Be Happy (Gospel/New Orleans Funeral March).<br /><br />The musicians and their instruments are:  Ry Cooder (Guitar, Bottleneck Guitar, vocal, mandolin, tiple, harp), Mario Guarneri (Cornet), Randy Aldcroft (Trombone), Harvey Pittel (Alto Sax, Clarinet), Pat Rizzo (Alto Sax), Bill Hood (Bass Sax), John Rodby (Piano), Mark Stevens (Drums), Stuart Brotman (Cymbalum), David Lindley (Mandobanjo, Mandolin), Barbara Starkey (Pump Organ), Red Callender (Tuba), George Bohanon (Baritone Horn, Trombone), Oscar Brashear (Cornet), Earl Hines (Piano), Chuck Domanico (Bass), Tom Collier (Marimba, vibraphone), David Sherr (Bass Clarinet, Clarinet), Tom Pedrini (Bass), Willie Schwartz (Clarinet), Chuck Berghoffer (Bass), Quartet: Jimmy Adams, Bill Johnson, Simon Pico Payne and Cliff Givens.<br /><br />This is a very talented group of people giving us some excellent renditions of songs from an earlier time in our history.  The performances are excellent, as is the CD recording itself. Five stars for an excellent album.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A nice blend of action and wit, Clare develops a fascinating world right in the shadows of our own. An excellent and quick summer read.
0316247545|5.0|This book is amazing. I got it for my five year old daughter and she can't get enough of it. She can't read just yet, but that hasn't stopped her from looking at all of the beautiful pictures. The book is hard back and looks like it should cost a small fortune. It was designed to look just like the Elements of Harmony book in the show (my daughter showed me that!). It is really well done and includes a synopsis of every episode to date (along with pictures). This is a great book for anyone who is a fan of MLP (even my three year old son loves to look through it!).
B007YO6MRA|4.0|It's the greatest album that combines Funk, POP, and Jazz leading to a positive theme.  These artist do not need to use sex ,  foul language and other gimmi​cks to promote their product.  It's truly a classic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey brings us exceptional acting by favorites such as Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern and the delightful Maggie Smith. It will push otherwise not well-known actors into stardom.<br /><br />The story lines are delicious. The scenes of the inside and outside of the mansion are mesmerizing. I love this series!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is good but I don't want to spend real money on virtual ponies. I wish someone would fix it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Google says they are working on a fix...but for now...since I have an AMD video driver laptop...all I can cast are youtube videos. Anything on a chrome browser tab has a frozen video display. Google....any update? Any fix? Perhaps it's time to just return the product.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not my favorite. It took a while, but it did get interesting about halfway thru  and kept my interest until the end.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book and look forward to discussing it with a book club - such a powerful story of resilance and hope in the midst of such personal agony.
B005PK553C|5.0|The writing is excellent and Jessica Lane is fantastic. As well as the other cast. I've seen the 1st episode and I was hooked. Will recommend to my friends to watch the show.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was one if the best books I've read in a while. I couldn't put it down. A great story and very well written
1934429821|5.0|Such a great size book. Thick and full of wonderful illustration but you can handle it with one hand.May have to get one for my husband....the first copy was for my dad.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love Greek mythology and funny books. But there were combined which in my opinion is the best series ever :P
B007A2O3FO|5.0|An enchanting story, well written as well as well acted, by a superb cast! Streamed this from Amazon Instant Videos (love this feature) with opportunity to watch again! Excellent time spent being entertained!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|just wish they would bring out a new serise, one can only hope. be nice too see arnie in it once in a while too.
1451695195|5.0|Fantastic to hear of this doctors incredible journey.  I thank him for sharing this with all of us who are willing to hear ( and share ) his experience!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used different keyboards available and like most users I have to say it doesn't get any easier than this. If you're looking for a better keyboard, give this one a try.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It seems to be a pretty decent application,easy to navigate and great graphics. Although I became bored with it after a short time because it's a slower paced game then what I prefer, I would recommend it to others who enjoy slower paced apps.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great writing, great story, great intrigue! I'm not a big sci-fy fan, but this story is so plausible that I never entertained the thought of it being anything but relevant and believable. Can't wait for the next installment....I have become a big fan. I hope the cost is kept down, as a side note. There are a lot of us seniors on fixed income out here!
B006O6F932|5.0|7 year old loved it! Nice quality and it folds up neatly when not in use. I would recommend it.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|quite watching after 30 minutes,  which was 20  minutes longer than this flic  deserved.  Gatsby  just doesn't go with rap! and whatever story  line the director intended was a mystery to my wife and I.  Not even worth 1 *  in this viewers opinion.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Surprisingly...not ALL about prison life.  I was chatting with a friend who saw the tv series & found it a bit too graphic.  When I told her that some of the incidents she described in the TV series were not detailed in the book, she was excited to read the book.  It is well-written and a book that is hard to put down once you begin it.  Piper is a very likable main character & her navigation of prison life is quite interesting.
B008220D5K|5.0|It must be kept in mind that this movie is an &#34;adult comedy&#34; and not intended for children...and although there are children in the story, everyone including the kids are simply hilarious in the different parts that they portray throughout the movie. This is the kind of movie that is worth watching at least 2 to 3 times over again.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower was short and full of all the awkwardness of being a teenager. Hard to read because the kids life was just so terrible.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|It reminds me of The Shield, from the bad guys point of view.  I was a huge The Shield fan, and SOA ranks right up there with the Shield, Rescue Me, Nip Tuck, and all the other great FX series.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Basic premium game. Lots of fun and a good time sink. My only beef with it is you can not upgrade, merge or breakdown items without the Internet.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is the 4th time I will be reading this book.  Using Kindle as have given away all the others to friends and they don't give it back.  Who knows where these books are now - traveling the globe........A wonderful human story full of love, laughter and the human condition!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|No need to present this now-classic game, perfect realization, both fun and challenging when you hunt for 3 stars on each levels, new game mechanics at each tier... Perfect game
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I gave this to my daughter for her birthday gift. She requested this one. I have not heard any complaints about it so I guess 5 stars are in order especially for Amazon's Prime 2 day shipping when you want things fast!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it i also have it on my cell phone. Enjoy being able to ready my word no matter where I am at.
B003ODL004|5.0|Very nice sound track. I use it for working out.  I envision the people running through the movie, while I'm listening to the music, and it really gets me working out faster.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This works great! I now get YouTube on my tv. You can use chrome to chromecast as well. With the auto software updates works very well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Collins delivers once again with suspense and surprise in the 3rd book of the hunger games. A little darker than the other two, but a good, quick read.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Great cd. .............................boys round here is one of the best ever!  Blake Sheltpn is great.  Still like Eric Church better!
B00BLFY61M|5.0|This whole review thing is a pile of b------t for a movie I could have rented but chose to buy.  If your &#34;ratings' are going to be computer generated, then generate something that has relevance.  I could have hated the movie and liked the service, or vice-versa.  GET A LIFE!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Real nice book gives you insight on worldly issue but in that fantastical view nice can't wait to start reading volume 2.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a great show if you like sci-fi. It's a good show for the whole family. Recommend. Thank you.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works as claimed, and I have detected no 'hiccups' in the product. The display is  as clear to navigate as the full 'on-line' eperience.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very familiar with the game and enjoying it.  I especially like it on my Kindle so I can hold the screen horizontally giving more room and better vision.  Plenty of games no repeats it seems.
1616551607|5.0|The kit with 3 books is much better than I imagined and the finish of the case is sensational.<br /><br />Who is a fan of Final fantasy amano and have to have these books in the collection.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Really needed walkthrough for hardest puzzle. Lots of steps to the solution and they do not appear logical at first.  Worth trying however.
B00C6B9H46|5.0|I already owned this movie on DVD, but I bought the Blu Ray version just to support the franchise and increase sales numbers.  With the newest Riddick movie coming out in a matter of days, I want to support the films as much as I can to ensure Diesel keeps making them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|These are fun puzzles. There are challenges for math people, and other visual concepts.  There are to be more levels. I am waiting for them.  There is also a walkthrough blog if you are frustrated. Definitely a brain warm-up,perfect for train commuting or waiting for your dentist appointment etc.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This album is absolutely stunning.  After a lackluster and understandably-directionless release like \\"Nightmare,\\" I was worried that perhaps A7X was lost forever.  This album, however, is effing amazing.  For comparison, and to let you know where my personal tastes stand: I feel like \\"Waking the Fallen\\" has been A7X's best album up until the release of \\"Hail to the King.\\"  With this newest effort.... well, it'll take time for me to be sure, but so far I think this album may actually be better than \\"Waking the Fallen.\\"  I've only listened to it about a dozen times, I'll need to let it grow on me more to be able to decide for sure which is my favorite.<br /><br />Favorite track from the new album: Acid Rain.  Epic.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I enjoy this game but when the spread is shallow and large I have a  problem with reading the tiles.  This game would probably be better on a larger more magnified screen .I have this game on Kindle but would like better on a PC screen of 17 to 27 inches.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was a little disappointed after reading The Kite Runner, but this is still a good book. It is a<br />Iittle confusing at times switching from character to character. I found myself guessing how they would all intertwine. I was disappointed with the ending, or I would have perhaps given a higher rating.
B0002IQOZA|1.0|Bought this album as a replacement for one that was stolen. It's not the real CD as the real one came with a booklet and a music video for The Christmas Song. I could download all the songs and print out front and back covers myself for a fraction of the cost. I wanted the CD that was originally released, not a cheap imposter...
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Really did no justice to one of the greatest books ever written. No heart and all noise. The acting was fine, but the direction and screen play was horrible.
0061122092|3.0|This is a story about discovering yourself and using someone you've spent time with in your past.  An old friend/ love finds a woman who is on a set path but has never truly lived life on her own because of youth and seeking education.  She finds religion and love though this man only for him to leave her.<br />Personally I think the man is someone I'd never stay with, because his religion was about all his beliefs in a very overzealous fashion. This poor woman had no room to take it all in and was put in a position to believe her own life and friends had no value until she meet this man.  I would of enjoyed the story more if she would of taken the time to step away, finish her schooling and travel on her own to find herself.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Only wish that as a whole, the places would charge one &#34;overall&#34; shipping and handling charge when I purchase multiple CDs from the same company.  Every company does the $3.99 shipping and handling charge for each CD purchased whether or not you purchase multiple CDs on the same purchase ... When I buy muliple CDs from the same place (under the same transaction),  the CDs come in the same &#34;pouch&#34; so why not give a &#34;shipping and handling discount&#34; when we purchase multiple CDs from the same place ...  if you don't want to do this, then ship each CD in an individual packet (at least then I will &#34;feel&#34; like the $3.99 charge PER CD is then necessary since all the CDs will NOT be combined in one shipping pouch and the Company will then not &#34;gain&#34; more &#34;profit&#34; (per se) when they send the CDs in the one shipping pouch)!!!!!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|We recently watched The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey on our Samsung 3D TV.  It was great!  I'm not going to get into the story line and how it's different than the original or any other blah blah blah stuff.  There are plenty of those reviews for people to read.  This is a movie based on a book.  The story is great, the animation and special effects are incredible!  I didn't see any cars driving down the road in this one! :)  All of the characters are very enjoyable and I think they were all cast perfectly.  It's a great movie.  Don't get hung up on it not being true to the original or any of that.  Just watch it and enjoy it for yourself.  After all, you probably didn't read it. Don't comment if you did.  I really don't care. :)
B00CDT41RY|5.0|We really enjoyed this....I would highly recommend this.  Great actors and a great story line. Five more words are required.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|This game is alright to pass time, however I think you have to spend too much time and cash on boosts
0142000655|5.0|I can see why the setting is so important in John Steinbeck's novels.  It's the first thing we get to experience in East of Eden.  The descriptions that John Steinbeck writes about the Salinas Valley, where East of Eden is set,  made it sound like paradise.  I don't know why, but I was completely enchanted when they are digging a well in the valley and they discover shells from the ocean and redwood from an ancient forest that had both been there a long time ago.  It gave the setting this beautiful tie to something ancient since this story is a modern version of a Bible story.<br /><br />I absolutely adore books that are filled with allusions.  They feel like buried treasure for those who want to find them.  The story is wonderful on it's own, but there's a treasure hunt if you want to go on it.  And East of Eden was just brimming with allusions.  Some of my favorites that I picked out were:<br /><br />The Spaniards coming to America and naming everything (kind of like Adam did)<br />Charles talks about a mark on his forehead (that reminded me of the mark of Cain)<br />Biblical phrases scattered throughout like \\"fruit of his loins\\"<br />The shady inheritance that keeps getting handed down in the family (that is kind of like Original Sin)<br />Samuel tells Adam that Cathy was beautiful to him because he built her that way and called her Adam's own creation.  (Like Eve being made from Adam's rib)<br />\\"They were not pure, but they had a potential of purity, like a soiled white shirt\\" -pg 216 (reminded me of Christ and the Atonement)<br />And the ultimate allusion all in one scene - children falling asleep in the dust, the adults are drinking wine while they talk about the Cain and Abel story.<br /><br />Even the title of the book is an allusion to Cain being punished by God and banished to the land of Nod, which was east of the garden of Eden.  I felt like this novel is about how we all live just a little east of perfection.<br /><br />John Steinbeck has completely mastered the art of showing instead of telling.  Nothing is a joy to read more than a story you figure out on your own.  Plus I loved how he said things.  I think I highlighted half of this book.  This quote I found absolutely beautiful:<br />\\"They called him a comical genius and carried his stories carefully home, and they wondered at how the stories spilled out on the way, for they never sounded the same repeated in their own kitchens.\\"<br /><br />- John Steinbeck, East of Eden, pg 10<br /><br />And this quote is just as funny as it is true:<br />\\"The medical profession is unconsciously irritated by lay knowledge.\\"<br /><br />John Steinbeck, East of Eden, pg 587<br /><br />One last quote that just leaves me in awe.<br />\\"He stepped outside and looked up at the stars swimming in schools through the wind-driven clouds.\\"<br /><br />-John Steinbeck, East of Eden, pg 526<br /><br />I loved all the different variations of sibling relationships and father/son relationships that ranged from beautiful and normal to dysfunctional and sad.  My favorite relationship was Tom and Dessie's tragic relationship that was kind of an anti-version of Cain and Abel.<br /><br />And I loved all these characters.  There's Cal, who sees the world as it is and fights against evil that he sees and his brother Aron, who tries to run away and hide from the world and the evil he sees there.  There's this moral extremism in the characters - Cathy is evil incarnate, Aron is the epitome of goodness and Cal is on the middle road dealing with his own inner struggle and you wonder which path he might end up on.<br /><br />The big theme in this novel is rejection, how we all deal with it, and how possibly all human problems are caused by it.  Aron is crushed when Abra rejects his gift.  Cal punishes Abra for liking Aron.  And all the characters deal with jealousy in one form or another.  As I watched all these characters go through different kinds of rejection, it made me reflect on the rejection I receive and how much unnecessary rejection I deal out.<br /><br />Cal is by far my favorite character.  I loved watching him slowly change when he realizes he has no reason to be so mean.  I was glued to the book as I watched Cal go indirectly down the path that Cain did and just hoping that Cal's story would end differently.<br /><br />East of Eden brought up a point that I hadn't noticed before.  We are Cain's children.  Cain lived and had children. Abel didn't.  And we all have to face rejection like Cain did.<br /><br />So much of the story revolves around the idea of free choice vs. inheriting a good or evil nature.  Evil needs good.  For example, Cathy needs to control Adam. But the reverse is oddly not true.  Good does not need evil.  I love the way that Chapter 34 opens:<br />A child may ask, \\"What is the world's story about?\\" And a grown man or woman may wonder, \\"What way will the world go? How does it end and, while we're at it, what's the story about?\\"<br /><br />-John Steinbeck, East of Eden pg 411<br /><br />I loved that the children and adults ask the same question.  And I loved John Steinbeck's answer - that there is only one story and it's that humans are caught in a net of good and evil.<br /><br />I found it fascinating that the big turning point in the novel is about a single word - timshel.  It's Hebrew for \\"thou mayest\\" and it literally changes the story of Cain and Abel into a choice between good and evil.  It's lazy and weak to say that you're destined for good or evil.  And it's cowardly to run or hide from a choice.<br /><br />The characters of East of Eden discuss how a great and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last.  They come to the conclusion that the Cain and Abel story is about everyone, but I want to add that I think East of Eden is a story about everyone, too.  I did not expect to like this book as much as I did especially since I had started it as a teen and put it down because I just didn't get it.  I'm glad I waited toread it as an adult.  This is the longest and most in-depth book review I have ever written because I just had so much to say and love about East of Eden.<br /><br />Overall, it was full of amazing characters, beautiful writing, and a hopeful ending. This modern re-telling of Cain and Abel is really about the ultimate human story.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Pretty good movie.... My husband saw this movie some time ago and had it hyped up quite a bit, but all in all it was good.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Enjoyable game but once you've created a few looks gets boring.  I would recommend for young children below the age of ten.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod's cd is very good. Nice to hear fresh music from my boy. Anyone go see Rod in concert, he's fantastic.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player is a well designed and well built network device. It took about twenty seconds to install and set it up. I am currently using it to stream Netflix, Google Prime, and Youtube. All works perfectly. Highly recommend this product.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|While there are a decent number of similarities, Atlantis does a pretty decent job of not trying to copy SG-1 in another galaxy.
B007STXHTM|3.0|This is a nice housing, and I use it for scuba diving.<br />I would recommend purchasing some anti-fog strips, just for incase the conditions are cold or humid. (Not only in the water)<br />The only thing I really do not like about the housing is that the information display is half covered. Look closely at the picture.<br />Which becomes very annoying when the battery dies on a second or third dive. Learned my lesson though.<br /><br />I would wait until the next generation goes down in price. They come with a similar housing that had been thought through.<br />I lost 50% value on the camera, and about 30 % on this housing. In less than a year and a half on the Hero2.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband and I love this game. We play with family and friends as often as we can. With the game tiles you never have the same game layout as before.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I will admit it! lol I am 35 and play games with my children.  :D<br />It is really neat that you can link your games and invite your friends. I am linked to my 7 children whom all have kindles and this WONDERFUL game is a Multi-device game so you buy it once and all kindles on your account can download it and play it.<br />All of us play it and it is appropriate for every age from our 5 year old to our 15 year old....and me :D<br />The tasks in this keep it interesting and keep you coming back. The COOLEST thing about this game is you can play without even following the tasks which is perfect for the little ones (5 and 6 year olds) and the crops NEVER WITHER!! No more aggravating &#34;buy more gems or coins to revive your dead plants so you can cry and ask mom or dad just to be told &#34;No&#34; so said mom or dad looks like a real jerk!&#34;<br />Overall, a GREAT buy!!
B0078X2LKY|4.0|I bought this book for my son on the kindle fire after my sister showed me it on her ipad. The ipad version reads it to you and has you press points on the tablet, my son loved it. This one is just the book.<br /><br />It's still a good book, just wish I could find some like my sister has on her ipad for my kindle fire.
140053271X|1.0|My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.  Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.  This is not the way to treat customers.  I am canceling all my pre-orders and I will try a different ereader.
0345803485|1.0|I truly enjoy reading the reviews on Amazon. They are generally accurate and unbiased so I was surprised that someone actually bought a book on the \\"Best Sellers\\" list. Are you kidding? That is the absolutely worst way to choose a book. The masses are asses and will buy anything widely advertised. Just like the movies, mostly junk. Time to wise up and read reviews you can trust.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love the story line. The actors are fantastic.  I Wish it would be put back on the air .  absolute admiration for this show
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I have read this book several times and always enjoy it.  So far, I've enjoyed all of Baldacci's Camel Club books.

1442361557|2.0|It may be just the protagonists are unpleasant people, but &#34;The Red Queen&#34; was like that too. I got very tired of hearing Henry rant on about &#34;the boy&#34;, and I got very tired of Elizabeth his Queen. I was glad to have it end
B005IQZB14|5.0|Fun, inspiring and extremely entertaining story!  I would love to hang out with this chick - so adventurous and brave with a great view on life!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I like the Eva and Gideon storyline. However, I don't like when a book leaves me hanging. Looking forward to learning. All the things that make the characters unique.
B003PGNBNY|4.0|It's just a continuation of the first movie. The kids have matured and they have to try to save the camp.
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|THE DOWNSIDE for many reviewers starts with the fact that Mezco's Heisenberg is actually a small statue then an articulated action figure. I can understand that but personally I don't have an issue because I prefer to keep my figures (statue in this case) in the mint condition of the original packaging. Oh waaait I do have an issue! What happened to all of these Heisenberg's packaging??? Its like Amazon(?) sabotaged the collector aspect of it and then they put them in a flimsy thin box that wasn't exactly the right size for this item. There is tape holding part of the plastic clamshell packaging and the other ends are opened already. It appears to have been crushed flat between something. I read the warnings from other reviews but I took a leap of faith for the great price. It's obvious they are shipped in this condition. It's a real shame because now I am scouring ebay for my chance to receive a now more expensive collector's approved one instead, sealed and mint.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently Amazon dropped the ball with the crushed packaging, most likely from the wrong size box. Now after going to the local Toys R Us I see that every Heisenberg they had in stock showed signs of being opened, stapled and taped. That is done by the store because Mezco also dropped the ball with really bad adhesive(glue) used on the packaging. Even if you find one sealed it might still fall off at some point. Really bad on Mezco's part.<br /><br />The packaging itself is the same color green as the show's opening credits with a picture of Heisenberg's head top left and Breaking Bad written on the top right. Light images of a gun and lots of money are the background of the front side. And of course the smoke like the opening credits is visible. The back side of the packaging has the same background with a picture of the figure and information about other merchandise for sale.<br /><br />THE BRIGHT SIDE is that Heisenberg does look exceptional!  The paint job to me looks great from the green eyes and brown facial hair to the brown belt buckle and white buttons on the shirt, maybe not mind blowing but I wasn't disappointed. In my opinion he really does look like Bryan Cranston. Another reviewer wrote that the color pallet for the shirt, pants and shoes may not be completely accurate to the TV version but I can also overlook that as i'm a grateful fan this even exists. But I admit that it would have been nice to see a different color of pants like khaki since the shoes and jacket are already black. Of course even the stock photo has different colors for parts of the clothes compared to the real thing. It must have been the superior prototype. Also written in the reviews is the paint job around the hand and gun. The skin color kind of overlaps to where the gun should be black and vise versa. This probably is the weakest part of the paint job and it may vary but i'd say its not a deal breaker. Someone savvy can patch that up if they wanted to as well as anything they want. I have already seen some customized versions online.<br /><br />When in my hand it has a good weight to it. The removable hat and glasses are a plus, too bad the gun in the right hand couldn't be the same. The gym bag with money fits in the left hand good but unfortunately he tips over so perhaps some adhesive under the shoes will be needed to display him with it. There's also a bag of 99% pure blue meth that fits in the left hand's fingers via a hole on one side of the bag. I displayed him on top of my desk so he does stand on his own and he looks awesome! Overall I am very satisfied how this came out. Mezco did a descent job in sculpting \\"the one who knocks\\". It's not jaw dropping but still wonderful.  Just remember that it isn't a figure since there are no movable parts. You are buying a 6\\" plastic statue.<br /><br />SO if you are planning to remove Heisenberg out of the packaging anyway then you can still buy it here or at Toys R Us if they are still available. That way you can pick out the best one. And so far it seems that no one has mentioned any damage to the actual item inside. The packaging is  likely to be the only thing compromised. But for the rest of us collectors...well it really is unacceptable. I'd recommend searching for Mezco's green haz-mat suit Walter White very soon before Amazon decides to start throwing these out of an RV as well and sell them as \\"new\\". Unfortunately I fear for the packaging as it will probably be the same cheap adhesive holding it together. Good luck in finding your best purchase.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my first review!
0307895505|5.0|This covers almost everything you could ever want to know about everyone's new favorite RPG game! It's so thick and huge, you could kill someone with it!!! Comes with a huge, full color map of Skyrim and all the add on maps. My only complaint is that I wish it would include things like easter eggs and glitches. When doing the quest &#34;No one Escapes Cidhna Mine&#34;, it glitched out and I expected to be able to open this book and see if there was a remedy for the glitch or what causes it, any info on it, etc. The book however, doesn't include that. It also includes CHECKLISTS for quests, side quests, items, etc., which I LOVE! Overall, the book is amazing, the price is AMAZING, because I would expect a book like this to easily be fifty dollars!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book!  This book had lots of twists to it with a very big shocker at the end.  It was very well written.  It wasn't difficult to read, but you had to pay attention to follow what was going on. Definitely would recommend it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Wow. So good I couldn't even put this down! I didn't want to stop reading. This fast read kept my attention the whole way through. A must read!
B00006JI3U|1.0|It was defective.....when I put the DVD in it would not play. How do I get my money back????  It was for my daughter's birthday...she was so disapointed when it wouldn't play!!!!
B005NS0VNU|5.0|Excellent album.  Great hearing the old songs.  I like it when artists will put together an album covering the body of their work.
B002ZG9968|4.0|Another one of my favorites. Its just very cute, a lot of funny moments. And so many good actors in this movie. too!

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was the first Liane Moriarty book I'd ever read and I loved it!  The characters felt like real people; you can't help but care for them.  The ending may have been a little far-fetched, but it didn't spoil the experience of the book for me.  Since &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; I've read several more of this author's work and am now her biggest fan.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have all three Quell games and they are all really good games, but this is my favorite.  This is really two games in one.  First you try to get all the pearls, or turn on all the lights, or illuminate all the diamonds, or a combination of all three depending on the chapter you are in.  Once you complete that you need to find the hidden gem and sometimes the hidden level. Many of the levels are easier than the other Quell games, but some are really hard.  I had a hard time finding some of the gems and hidden levels. There is an outline of a gem in the upper right hand corner of the screen that tells you if you are looking for just the gem or a hidden level as well.<br />  I hate the mindless running and jumping games,so I really like this game. It is relaxing but makes you think.  Well worth the price.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Almost as good as 1st good effects leads into the next one with you wanting to see what they do now
B000NY12LO|2.0|I found the story very slow. Although bullying is very traumatic, I didn't think the character that was depicted in the story extreme behavior was fully developed to explain his actions. Big let down for me.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I truly enjoyed this game, slightly challenging, but also quite easy to get a firm grasp on the goings on in-game. Would highly recommend it to any interested parties!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The third season of Downton Abbey was great, although tragic.  I loved the character development against the backdrop of changing morals, economics, fashion, and societal norms.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I think it is a very good game.  I have found no flaws or anything negative to say about it.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Not too bad for a class B blood and guts flick  I normally don't go for those kind of movies. But it kept my attention, and was some what entertaining
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Glad I found this game it is fun and keeps me occupied while everyone is at work and school I can't stop playing .
B004OC07GM|5.0|Solid analysis of the innovator's dilemma, and great real-world examples of innovations and their inventors. Really liked it. Highly recommended.

B00D6B4PUG|3.0|I got this for my Kindle.  The display has been reworked and it's confusing  Haven't been able to figure out how to manage emails yet.  Contacts are three levels down in the &#34;down arrow&#34;.  Confusing.  UNINSTALLING this app and going back to the standard app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really good yet simple app. Helps a lot with math and looks great on the kindle fire. Definitely recommend for those who want a calculator for there kindle fire:)
1250029465|1.0|I am not a fan of cats so doubt I would like this book. Perhaps if the co star was a dog I would get it.
1401216676|5.0|Thinking about getting this? Well if you love Batman and the Joker then this is a definite must have!! The art is amazing the story gripping! Just buy it already!!
B004JMRDQE|5.0|I most definitely enjoyed the movie, The Legend of 1900, and was deeply moved by the story.  Tim Roth did a very good job of conveying the loneliness and wistfulness of the characters emotions.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you are thinking about watching Firefly for the first time I do recommend buying the series. It goes so fast you'll want to re-watch it again and again. And the ending is actually good!! I loved this!!! And am still loving it!!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enough good words can not be said of Downton Abbey. Fabulous costumes, magnificent setting and wonderful characters played by classical good actors makes this series one of PBS&#34;s best. Don't miss it.

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Wow- haunting. You will love it. Best 5 bucks spent. You won't be let down- and that's all I have to say.
0062511408|3.0|The pages in the book are in good condition, but all the answers were written in the book.  I had to go through the whole book to erase the answers, but I can say I am still happy about the book for the price I got it for.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Lovely film<br />The performances were amazing.  I bow to actors such as these.  The scenery was lush, yet serene.  Bravo !
B00782O7IY|5.0|A very fine movie. I have seen it; my friend had it on her Amazon wish list, so I bought it for her birthday. She was happy with it.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|It is very good pdf reader. It has access to you cloud and annotations. Smooth and very intuitive app, like it.
0439813786|5.0|I bought this for a friend's birthday, and she was very happy to receive it. It is a beautiful and imaginative book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|A movie that can be enjoyed with entire family. Kids really enjoyed it! Can't wait to watch Despicable Me - 2 now.
B00280LYIC|4.0|A solid and amusing book series. I came to it with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised!  A quick and easy read appropriate for almost all ages.
B004SIP88Y|5.0|This is on  of the prettiest movies i have ever seen. The story us easy to follow. I saw it for the first times years ago and hunted it down. Would make a great addition to your movie collection. Great for all ages
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fantasic book suspenful,keeps you guessing, will read her other books.  Should be 5 or older to read, a little sex
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful, easy, engrossing read. The book jumps from character to character leaving you waiting to know what happens to each one at the end of each chapter. As the stories evolve and become more entwined, they all find themselves facing hard life decisions. Makes you feel for each character and has you asking yourself, &#34;what would i do in their position?&#34; A beautifully written book that i would recommendation to all.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|if you like horses, then you'll LOVE this app. I know I do. TRY THIS APP PEOPLE! if you don't I will find you!!!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I thought that the game was absolutely wonderful! It works perfectly on my kindle fire, and the story line was interesting throughout. Fun and excitable, this game will never leave you hanging.
B005LAII4E|4.0|As expected - a fun to watch adventure with plenty of action.  Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the story.
B00A285OOW|4.0|She has read and loved everything Philippa Gregory has written.<br />I won't be reading it.<br />Note: Amazon just required me to add five more words and you just read them.  What's with that?
B008JFUO4U|5.0|A surprisingly good SciFi movie.  Tom Cruise pulls off another good character.  Story line was refreshing and a joy to watch.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|The first season is where this tv series monumental hit all started!!  If you are constantly hearing about the Walking Dead and have never seen it....This is the best place to start!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The fade in feature is terrific! I'm not jolted awake, and can just lie there listening to my own music. A good start to the day.
0062255657|4.0|Ocean at the End of the Lane wasn't as spectacular as Stardust by Gaiman was for me, probably because this one takes place in our world, but it is still an awesome read. It is creepy (not enough to give me nightmares though!) but with sentimentality and with passages I enjoyed reading over a couple times because they were written so well or just struck a chord with me.<br /><br />The characters in this story are wonderful. The main character, a young boy, narrates for us and we see events unfold through his eyes, which at times is heartbreaking and at others insightful and uplifting. It was very interesting to view some very adult situations through a child's viewpoint (though of course it was written by an adult, it's still intriguing). There are also three great otherworldly ladies; the Hempstocks. A grandma, mom, and daughter who really, for me anyway, made the story...I loved them. They were mysterious and knowledgeable and the kind of people I would love to know.  Then there is this terrifying really creepy villain who scared the bejeezus out me.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the story takes place in our world with the fantasy element being very blended into the real world. It's hard to describe the plot without giving too much away...so I will just say it was magical... and a bit heartbreaking... yet still wonderful!
0064471837|5.0|The Abhorsen Trilogy is one of my favourite series of books. All three individual books are wonderful, and Sabriel has that knack of pulling you furiously into Nix's universe without so much as a struggle. More than once I've missed stops on public transport while reading this book, and I can't count the number of times I've apologised to lamp-posts and bollards because I didn't want to waste valuable reading time whilst walking with this book.<br />Despite there being a serious event running through the length of the tale, Nix injects just the right amount of humour and wit to take the edge off the solemnity. The character development is amazing, and it takes barely moments to have your minds eye's version of what each person looks and sounds like. The descriptions are vivid and beautiful, too.<br />All in all; buy this book. And then you'll need the other two. You definitely won't regret you did, although the only thing you might end up being sorry for is explaining why you're late to work missing a stop on the bus.
159463176X|5.0|So I finally read this...I put it off and put it off because, honestly, I just didn't want to feel as depressed as I have with Hosseini's previous novels The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I mean they were wonderfully written, but I felt so sad after reading them.  But, I finally bit the bullet and gave it a go...and guess what? I'm not sad! This was an amazing book, very well written...and not thoroughly depressing.  I gained something from it, which is always a wonderful feeling.<br /><br />\\"J'aurais dû être plus gentille--I should have been more kind. That is something a person will never regret. You will never say to yourself when you are old, Ah, I wish I was not good to that person. You will never think that.\\"<br /><br />I was really confused when I started reading this because of the format it was written in. It's not your traditional linear story, nor your flip from present day to past with flashbacks between different characters.  It tells a cohesive story from the viewpoints of different characters throughout different parts of each of their lives, but they all fit together like one giant puzzle. And at the end you'll go `Ahhh!'<br /><br />For me, it was amazing to see how what seemed like one simple decision at the very beginning of the story, turned out to be one huge complicated...well mess.  It made me think \\"Hey, I shouldn't judge people so harshly because there is probably a lot more to their story.\\"  The characters were constantly changing, but it's only because of the different sides you of them throughout the story...it's brilliant!  And one decision can change everything and impact many, many people.<br /><br />I would love to read this again someday to explore all the different aspects of the characters and how Hosseini managed to pull it all together.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVED it!!!! Best book ever!!!!!! Please please please wright more!!!!! This one is my fav of the trilogy!!!! :D
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Plot twists...good guys and bad guys (some folks are both), strong acting and writing. Watch it, you'll be glad you did!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|THERE WAS A FREAKING POLAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT!!!!!  And I don't know what I have to do, I only had 15minutes to play! I wish it was longer.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much I will make time to see it again . . . truly delightful and worth the time spent.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|After a while its kinda boring. No fun. But it's more fun 4 a little kid... not me. So no 5 star.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|This is not a normal, PD James Novel, (no really!!).  I think it was a little too wordy, not enough dialogue, etc.  Read previous reviews.  However, I did finally come to like it.  It is simply a lite fun read!
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Wonderful French,  romantic story line, characters, backdrop and sound track. Loved this movie. May not appeal to men<br />who don't appreciate a mostly romantic movie.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|A bit too much profanity but there is too much in everyday real life already....too bad, eh?  Where is the movies these days taking our kids....young and old?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If there was a zero star, I would give it that. I read 5 chapters and deleted book from my Kindle.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|It is a great Lego set.  It was a really cool scene in the movie.  It comes with awesome mini-figures. There is not much detail inside the castle though.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I'd been searching for a spare alarm clock to keep on my side of the bed for the past couple of weeks, especially one that dimmed so it wouldn't be shining in my face when I wake up every now and again in the middle of the night, as well as one with a few additional useful functions.  This app is the perfect solution, and I commend the developer for creating such a useful and artfully utilitarian app.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This season's episodes are very thought-provoking and put us in as many moral, ethical and personal dilemmas as past seasons but this time they seem to relate to a wider audience.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|What a terrific bargain!  It is one of my all time favorites.  Have recommended it to my family and friends.
B000I5X81K|2.0|The first song kept skipping. Was unable to hear all of the song. Song 2  skipped over entirely. Had to seek track manually.
B00280LYIM|5.0|It was amazing and fantastic!!!!! Y'all should read!! So much action incorrect is amazing! I read the whole thing in one day:)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game even more since it was updated. It is a little glitchy on start up sometimes, but it s awesome.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|A paid game with ads. Lets all send a message to<br /><br />the developers, that this is not ok<br /><br />do it .... do it.
0345529057|5.0|This is\\"Lord of the Rings\\"on good steroids. An addictive plot, memorable characters, gritty medieval atmosphere, you want it it's got it.Relax and give in to it and you'll find yourself living in Westeros.Bring supplies it's a long journey.
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|Makes you wish Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had written more Sherlock stories. The clickable table of contents allows readers to easily switch between stories.
B00AG297GK|3.0|made it seem on the trailers that it was the funniest movie but is not, but if you liked Borat this movie is for you
B00DPY95D6|5.0|A great read, really gripping material. I found it to be a simpler book that focused on a single story-line with the intensity of a pit bull.  The suspense builds as the plot unfolds and you will happily keep turning pages. The book has amazing detail on the courtroom experience that you wont find in other fiction. All in all, this is an entertaining read that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading it. Highly recommend this one.
B00AH6CCK8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums.  Symphony & Metallica at the same time.... You can't get much better than that.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Re-read this after 14 years in anticipation of the book. Just as good as the first time. Sci-fi fan must.
B004HSRZPO|4.0|Great insight into the early life of Frank Lloyd Wright, a fantastic architect who was ahead of his time, and the tragic story of his second wife.
B00EQUP3Q6|1.0|This album is basically Trent singing over various blips, bleeps, and beats. Very little melody, and very little that makes me want to listen to it ever again. I've listed to it 5 times trying to enjoy it, but there still isn't a single song on it that I would regard as better than \\"mediocre\\". Don't waste your money on this. I agree with another reviewer that said this sounds like How To Destroy Angels...because it does.
048622709X|3.0|this isn't that bad, but it's not going to be a magic bullet for learning to draw hands. It really doesn't go into foreshortening. It might have hundreds of hands, but it's limited and repetitive on angles.<br />I actually formed a bad habit of drawing Bridgman hands whether they fit or not. This whole book was covered better in couple chapters in his figure drawing book.
0385349947|3.0|Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead is an inspirational and empowering book for women (and men). I have since shared it with many other women and they agree it brings an intriguing perspective about women in the work place - and really our lives in general. As for the order, the book was delivered to me in a very timely manner, even with a potential 3 week flexibility delivery window. However, while the book is in perfect brand new condition, it is missing the weather-proof clear slip cover.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a great story, and it did have you thinking about the rights to die.  But it was a touching story friendship, trust and  acceptance without judgment, just love.
B00866JL96|5.0|Awesome!!!!! OMG.. I love the story line it's put together Perfectly!! The Perfect drama love story.. I have watched it over 6 times already.. awe to be young again
B0049JPU8A|5.0|This is my absolute favorite album by The Script! It does not contain a single song I don't love. The music is great, and the lyrics are incredible! The songs covers a wide range of emotions that everyone relates to, regardless of your own personal emotional state while you listen. Everyone who loves good music should add this album to their collection!
0767812387|5.0|I Love the Older Woman Younger Man.. They play their parts very well... Steamy. And I love dancing, Dancing with the Satrs.. Just as good .. But Love Story too..
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the kite runner and this book too , names were a little confusing, problematic will read his other boom
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Awesome Spinoff of Hanzel & Gretel... I like action,suspense movies.. Withes, Vampires,Ghosts .... Don't mater.. From Disney to Rated RRR love them all.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|If you like Bejeweled but want a little more excitement. Or if you like Atlantis you will really like this game. The levels not only get hard as they progress (by the way there are 81 of them!) the timing goes faster!  In other words you have less time to beat the clock.  Making it all that much more exciting.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|This is a great jumper and keeps my daughter entertained for a long time. You want to have some great laughs at your child, put them in this and when they figure out how to jump in it, it is priceless.
B0056P5R34|4.0|4 Weddings... is a classic/classy English romantic comedy with great writing and acting across the board.Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell are just bubbling with chemistry and the rest of the cast is wonderful. It is a sweet, funny and intelligent film, with over the top directing and writing. Impromptu is a partly fictionalized version of the romance between the Polish Composer Fredrich Chopin and the woman writer George Sand. Judy Davis is amazing as Sand and Hugh Grant is perfect as the sickly Chopin. Emma Thompson is hilarious as the art starved Duchess. Again the exquisite writing and directing by James Lapine makes this a must see, and is much less fictionalized than  Amadeus, where 90% of the story is made up for commercial reasons, like so many movies on famous people, like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, where all the spy stuff is made up to sell tickets. The Paradise film is a flop as there is no chemistry between male and female lead. And the writing is clunky. But the DVD is worth it by far for the first two films above, Recommended EAN
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|The game is totally addicting. It's interesting how you seem to know when people are play in teams against you. DO IT EVERYDAY, AND LOVING IT!
B00138GZAC|5.0|Sade is the best kept secret in music. Her musical style speaks for itself a breath of fresh air live or in the.stuido
B00E00P5JC|4.0|When I took my 6 year old to watch the movie, I had no expectations whatsoever of this movie and during the movie I was wonderfully surprised of how well this movie was put together. Very nice and great music!!!!
B00187MXNQ|5.0|I bought this album just from hearing \\"My Mistakes Were Made for You\\" alone. What a great find! Alex Turner has an amazing voice that never gets old. The music twists and turns you and throws you in completely unexpected directions. Production was exquisite, with every single instrument (and there are many) being clean, crisp, and at perfect levels.<br /><br />Since I simply MUST find something to complain about in everything, I guess I could say my only desire would be that the songs were longer, which is more of a compliment than a complaint. I hear Alex and Miles are working on a second album; I can't wait!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I received the dvd in record time and was very pleased with it....It plays perfect and you are a great seller...thanks so much for all your help...Blessings to you and yours..
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Really fun film!.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and really enjoyed hearing Meryl Streep sing - she is fantastic!  Great movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is fun, but addictive. Sometimes it doesn't credit you with your winnings but since I play for free.....why complain?  It's fun it's addictive
0062255657|5.0|A children's book that's not for children?  It's difficult to describe.  An adult fairy tale?<br /><br />It's beautifully written, and captures the feel of childhood instantly.<br />A short book, but BIG on story.<br />It's fun & furious, uplifting & downtrodden, scary & scarier, and impossible to put down!<br /><br />It's a great starting point if you haven't read Neil Gaiman before.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show. It is fantastic. The Amazon Instant Video worked great as well. I downloaded AIV to my Wii and played it just like Netflix! It was awesome, free (once I bought the season) and no interruptions!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I learned a great deal about the world in which Jesus lived -- information not widely disseminated.  I had always believed -- and Zealot confirmed -- that the Christianity which conquered a large swath of the planet was created by Paul.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Let me say first off, that it has been over a decade since I last bought an album. With the era of the internet and free music, it became an obsolete concept to me, like many in my generation. This is the first album that I felt compelled to shell out for, and honestly, I could not be more happy with my decision to do so.<br /><br />Ariana Grande is one of the most underrated talents in a very long time. While other pop stars (who shall not be named) are out twerking, and selling sex, and messages about being as skanky and irresponsible as possible, Ariana is singing about being kind to your fellow human, love, life, and being true to the people you care about. She does this all with POWERFUL, natural, vocals. In most of the tracks on this album, there is not filter, no autotune, just a piano riff, and her booming, mariah-esque vocals. On other tracks, she has that classic, 90's, destinys child type R&B sound that brings you back to the days when music was still QUALITY!<br /><br />This girl is the real deal. If you are on the fence about this album, seriously, pull the trigger. You will be glad you did. This girl deserves your support. One day she is going to be a top selling pop star, and you will be able to be that hipster saying &#34;oh yeah, I liked her music wayyyy before the world jumped on board&#34;

B0071XO8RA|3.0|As others have pointed out, there are services that will provide an author with thousands of five-star reviews on Amazon. You'll note that many of the five-star reviews of this book consist of four or five lines with a liberal sprinkling of generalities such as \\"amazing,\\" \\"excellent,\\" great,\\" but no specific case made to back up the praise.<br /><br />This is a real review.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!  BE WARNED!!<br /><br />1. Writing.<br /><br />A. Someone should have helped the author pare back the prose. For starters, there are too many references, descriptions and discussions of cables and cords, wires and widgets, sumps and pumps, breathing apparatuses, electrical systems, hydroponics, etc. etc. etc. My eyes glazed over.<br /><br />B. Way, way, WAY too many descriptions of how tired these folks are climbing those interminable stairs. Sheesh! If they'd lived in the silo all their lives, most of them would be fit as mountain goats.<br /><br />2. Implausibility<br /><br />A. The cleaning. To me it's as if someone said the following to the condemned:<br /><br />\\"You haven't done anything bad except express an interest in the view from that window over there. But we're going to put you to death anyway. Oh, and by the way, would you spend your last moments cleaning the glass so that other people can enjoy that same view?  Awfully decent of you.\\"<br /><br />And we're to believe that NO ONE (well almost no one) ever says. \\"Sorry, Charlie. I think I'll spend my last moment contemplating the great unknown or praying to God or thinking about my life instead of doing housework for you murderers.\\"<br /><br />Nope they all clean. It's like asking someone on death row to straighten up his cell before going to the gas chamber.<br /><br />B. Why is violence inevitable after someone just once refuses to clean? Nothing is inevitable when dealing with humans and their variability.  This book doesn't make enough allowances for individual unpredictability. Psychology isn't physics but this book treats it as if it is.<br /><br />C. The villain. One puny guy seems to have power to control, manipulate, and harm others. Where are his minions? They're a pretty murky lot.<br /><br />D. The science. Read the review by Robert Richardson \\"Spargel\\". He says it better than I could.<br /><br />E.

B0013TXA5Y|2.0|sigh. so predictable.  I was surprised it has been made into a movie.  I hope they included the Ewoks too.
B0001I562I|4.0|I was fond if this movie growing up and figured my 2 boys would like it too.  Its a good change from the 3D animated movies kids watch today.  This was an immediate hit with my 7 year old.<br /><br />DVD came quick and was brand new.

0399159347|5.0|This is my first experience with this author, and she is a genius.  The book is brilliant, so comic and tragic.  The characters were swirling around in the pages and popped right into my brain as lively, genuine people.  I was mesmerized with her writing style.  I couldn't wait to read what the secret was; then, after knowing, she kept the suspense going forward.  What an excellent job.  This author is an extremely creative talent, and I have ordered her previous work.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|with so much going on around the nieghborhood this is a good tool to have and use for patroling the neighborhood.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|This book could have been really, really good.  The premise was awesome, and that is what drew me in.  But, once I got into the meat of the book, maybe 50% through, it felt like the author was just searching for words to fill the pages, saying the SAME thing, portraying the SAME situations, feelings, scenarios etc.  It is sitting unfinished on my Kindle.  I tried to go back to it a couple times, but just couldn't keep reading.  Why take 100 pages to say what could be said in 2?
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|love love lovveee this game! but I have had it for 2 days and now it wont open on my kindle :( so sad. great game though... just wish I could still play it :( any ideas what is going on?

B0064CJNHE|3.0|For some reason the book came already marked. It seems as if someone got a sharpie and marked it. Other than that it was in great condition. The content of the book itself is another story. Dull, very dull book.

It is a great deal for $35, makes web browsing on TV easy and works great with Netflix and Youtube.

B004SKHJF2|1.0|Best advice? ...stick with the FREE versions of both Shazam and SoundHound. Often when one doesn't work (ie, identify the song), the other will.<br />Reason? ...FIRST, and most importantly (at least to me), be forewarned that Shazam Encore, when purchased via the Amazon App Store App,<br />REQUIRES that the Amazon App Store App be installed for it to run. If you decide to uninstall the Amazon App Store App as I did (because Amazon provides no sign-out option!?!?!),<br />then Shazam Encore will cease to run, and prompt you with a message stating the Amazon App Store App is required for it to work.<br />At which point also, it will crash your phone (ie, remove all icons just showing the home screen, with a non-functioning home button), requiring a restart.<br /><br />Why Amazon wants to risk customer security by FORCING people to stay logged into the Amazon App Store, I have no idea? ...but, its enough to force me NOT to use it.
1451695195|4.0|What I liked was that I believed everything the author wrote about his experience. I had a much less in depth experience but it was similar.<br />What I didn't like was that it was a bit too clinical for me. Thanks! Peace, Roy Mainville<br /><br />roymainville@msn.com
B006M9NJFG|5.0|This is the best canteen on the market...bar none. It is over sized slightly and is tough. Love the included cup. The pouch is durable. I personally carry this hiking every week.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|It is nice because is small, but sharp the knives as we thought. I am not happy with it. Sorry
1609611543|5.0|I am slowly reading through this book and want to highlight many key things, but that would make most of the pages yellow!<br />The author has done his homework, and it shows well in the research of this topic. This book will help bring a<br />new understanding of modern day wheat and the havoc that it wrecks on the body, especially the digestive system. Highly recommended.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Oscar Wilde's plays have always been fascinating to me with their clever repartee and social commentary.  This classic means more to me now than when I read it in High School.  Beautiful language and Wilde's usual subtle sneering comments on society of his time.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Not for me. Could have been cute but the story got lost in an attempt to draw out the plot. The long loving profiles of Tom Courtenay looking pensive got old. It was a bit over-directed. Seemed like it could have been a tight, funny 30-45 minute movie and instead made an hour and a half feel like 3.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Great movie really enjoyed it. I do not know how they got the tiger to do all those things. The boy was very good also
B002RKS81O|4.0|Another story that I love by Jane Austen. By no means a quick read but a good one!  She is so talented.
B00633W614|5.0|Great read. Could not put it down. Can't wait to read the next level to this collection. Love the author.
B00000ITOY|5.0|Good for teaching counting and shapes.  Very durable, nice wood and nicely painted/stained.  I think they will hold up to a lot of use and abuse from kids.
B00006JIA4|5.0|All their best works, how can it get much better than that!  What a talented group and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to purchase this collection at such a great price!  Thanks!
B0067TQQI8|1.0|Initially I was very please with this product. On a road trip it charged my iphone 4s twice. But after a few days of use it stopped being able to charge itself. It's completely broken and I'm very disappointed.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I have been wanting this album for so long and finally I purchased it and it was a good decision.  This band is phenomenol!
0439023521|5.0|The book was in great condition when it arrived.  Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to read it yet.. But I'll be able to eventually.
B0000C23DO|5.0|I bought this for a friend but I liked it so much, I may get one for myself. Thanks much.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|It seems impossible that it's been more than 30 years since this movie first came out. I remember going to see it. I gave me the thrill of a lifetime back then, and now it gives me the same/different thrill now. I sure miss those days when people actually had an imagination.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love a good suspense novel and this one kept the surprises coming right until the very end.  I enjoyed the character development and the skill with which the author developed the story.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Oh my goodness - this movie makes us laugh hard every time. Second one is OK, but the first is a riot! HIGHLY recommend it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|After downloading the game over a period of days (intermittently), I cannot get the game to load.<br /><br />Thanks for wasting my time Gameloft and Amazon, not to mention my credits.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|LOVED the premise and the action. Very well done. Could watch this one again. Special effects and costumes were fun, cast well.
B00DYFCZ2Y|5.0|I must say I'm completely blown away how well love in the future sounds it's gotta be his best work. I got say compared to his last album it was very subpar while this album showcases his amazing talent and the whole cd doesn't have one track t skip.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love the basic game play and the sound effects! Updates continue to make this game fun. All around great time passing game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it<br />So much fun<br />I'm 16 and I love it yes<br />Play it all the time<br />Recommended for when you're bored or laying in bed fun pass time
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Didn't know if I would like this game with a movie tie in and all but turned out to be a fun game and almost as addictive as the others!
1932100660|5.0|Anyone who cares for their well being and health should read this book, it has changed my thoughts about the way i will eat.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Love the season theams for this one! My kids love seeing what is on each level for the holidays and seasons we are in! Good time passer as well.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I watched this just to re-fresh my memory in anticipation of the up-coming season premier on FX.  The first season lays the groundwork for the entire series, and it is great (along with every other season thus far).  Love, love, loved it!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love this game, started with the free version and quickly got addicted and had to have the full version. Kids also love this game and replay all the levels. I think I may have to buy some of the tie in games inside this one to keep the fun going when I complete all the levels. The challenges from the other games that come up are lots of fun as well.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is cool. The underwater effects are nice and the game is easy to play. I can't wait to play the next one.
B004XZR63M|4.0|Helps change the way you think about money and how you should go about accruing wealth. A good stepping stone.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This app really works it helps me check  my homework and when i go to school and check it i get it right so this app really works : )
B0044C5SCU|3.0|It is exciting, thrilling, startling, and can be quite loud and dramatic.  I have enjoyed watching the show so far.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This is honestly one of my favorite movies and it played fabulously!! I LOVE ME SOME LEO!!!! It was also easy to find the next day
B008MG1E4A|5.0|All the Navy Seals are heroes to those of us here in the U.S.  This book, along with Kevin Kyles' book, gives a honest account of what these men do and sacrifice to keep our freedom and right of free speech, which sadly, is often abused. A must read.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a very fun game that is also challenging because you play against strangers.  I really recommend this game
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I find myself wanting more information on the characters and their backgrounds.  I can't wait for the second season to start - hurry, please.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|BEST SHOW EVER HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ITS JUST A ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTION AND FUN AND LOVE AND AT TIMES HATE
B009AY04A8|3.0|As a few others have posted nothing fancy but a good time waster. Many puzzels with a few different types in each chapter. Alot of reading, but not that bad.(not a great movie script) Its was very easy, lots of time to solve everything.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Good movie. Great for upcoming parents and all families in general. Funny and breathtaking. You learn your values in life
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This was a great book, and is a great DVD and comes with both 3D version and regular version. I loved this movie in the theater, as the videography was spectacular
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Very practical book, with an even more practice lesson - use check lists. If lists are good enough for pilots and surgeons, they're good enough for me...
0152465073|4.0|A classic that everyone must read, adults and children will enjoy this book and the story is one to remember.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Just finished it, don't really know what I felt. Hard to follow the story line at times, but the characters were very interesting. Is this really North Korea? It seemed a little too one sided, felt a little like Cold-War propaganda.
034580404X|5.0|I have never read anything like this book!!! But I will say I love them and I am not big on reading.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I must say that Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner are two of my favorite books. This story and these characters were not as compelling. Sorry Khaled, I love your writing, but this one fell short for me...
0446310786|5.0|Quick and great condition Great condition quick shipping. My daughter needed it for school and it arrived as promised. Book is read in every high school
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I read this over a couple of evenings. Easy enough read, just too dark for my interests. I was hoping for redemption in the characters' lives.
B001HN6922|5.0|even though I haven't opened the pkg. I am happy in how fast I received it. It will be a birthday present for my 3yr old<br />great grandson. I'm sure he will be delighted with it.
B000H7I6CU|5.0|My 2yr old boy is a fan of disney cars. So, when he got the movie he was so excited.  I recommend it.
B0061S073A|2.0|Kid Mode in android market is much better if Idk why I can't find it here. It adds it's own apps without you actually having to do it. Idk?
B00004STPT|5.0|Gladiator is wonderful, but get In Paradisum (Gladiator) by Blake.  This is the last part of \\"The Battle\\" and is not available as a separate track.  Just do it.  There are a number of classical pieces titled In Paradisum.  The one by Blake is what you want.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Nobody get this app i have a virus protector on my kindle and it said it takes yor email and password for amazon dont get it !!!!!!!!
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|GREAT BOOK AND A EXCELLENT READ. The type of love that it took for one man to get the girl he loves is truly inspirational.....
0385528787|5.0|This third book in the MaddAddam Trilogy, named for that trilogy, continues with the split story telling of book two but with a twist -- this time it is not as clear who is talking merely by chapter titles.  No this time you have to read generally a paragraph or two of each chapter to figure out if the viewpoint is Toby, the former Eve of the Gardeners, MaddAddam himself known by the name of Zeb, or one of the Crakers who has learned to read, write, and storyteller named Blackbeard.  Each of these three main characters has a unique voice but when they are Telling the Story their words and pacing are almost identical much like oral traditions are passed down from one bard to the next.<br /><br />The trilogy ends with a small enclave of humans and Crakers who have started to live and mate together and most of the action takes place in only the course of a few months though we have the steady flow of memories going back decades and a look into the future of maybe a year or so... that is unclear but then the need to keep track of time seems to have faded with the destruction of most of the human civilization.<br /><br />The series is really build around this enclave, each previous novel guiding us toward this third trilogy suggesting that Atwood had a master plan from the start.  Yet there are hints of other groups of humans out there in the world and we are left wondering if the Craker-human enclave will become dominant and usher in new human civilization or if they will be wiped out.  If you can handle loose ends to your apocalyptic fiction then this trilogy may well satisfy you as it did me.  If you want solid answers and definitive outlooks, skip this.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|It's what I would call a travelling book.  No concentration required and you can leave it behind when you leave
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Another really good read from Ms. Flynn.  She does an excellent job showing how family dysfunction is generational and how the way children are parented can impact them in such profound ways.  This is another book that I thought I had all figured out about 3/4 of the way through, then changed my mind but kept on reading......her writing is so good even if you figure it out you want to continue with the book.  I'm reading Dark Places currently and it is riveting too.  I became a real Gillian Flynn fan this summer.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|Well written and very thought provoking. Given the latest lot of women held prisoner for years one thinks about this book in a new light
B009AY04A8|2.0|Too much talking between characters. Penalty for taps a that aren't random. Eh. Did I mention. Too. Much. Talking. The dialogue is inane.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I am just now getting into this show and so glad I am. Hilarious! The cast is great. Already looking forward to season 3 =)
0143122916|4.0|A good book that covers the experience/escape of Shin Dong-Hyuk from the harshest North Korean prison camp.  The author tries to put the reader into the head of Shin, to try and get some perspective on the mindset and thought process of a person who is completely isolated from the rest of the world.<br /><br />The hardest message to convey about people born and raised in these oppressive/propaganda driven countries is trying to explain why those people think the way they do, and why they behave the way they do.  The social norms and interpersonal behavior that the rest of the civilized world takes for granted as a natural part of growing up doesn't exist for people who are raised in an environment such as the one Shin was brought up in.<br /><br />This is not a long or difficult book, but an important one as it does give you some insight into the mindset of people who are brought up in an oppressive regime such as North Korea.  It also raises awareness of these prison camps that exist to this day, that gets largely ignored by both mainstream media and mainstream politics.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This would be a much better game if you were able to enlarge the screen more and the contrast was better between the scenes and items were better
B0060AY6FO|3.0|James should stick to writing great mysteries and leave Jane Austen to Jane Austen. This is not a great PD James.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A little something to keep you occupied while waiting...or to just pass a little time..either way worth pushing the coins around
B000MRX2DI|4.0|My boy loves meerkats so we got this for him. It is hard plastic so don't leave it on the floor... What can I say about a toy?
0061339202|2.0|A lot of content to wade through, in miniscule font on cheap paper, did not make for a good start.  The book pretends to be academic, waffles on a lot and presents a few relatively simple ideas in an awful lot of verbage.  could be summed up effectively into a quarter the pages.  I'd skip this one.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|ordered this tape as we were going to go on a trip and this came really fast and is a good movie
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is the best keyboard for android devices, integration with systems is really wel done.<br /><br />I would like customize the skin.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|i ordered this movie as we  were getting ready to go on  a trip and this movie came really fast and was a good movie
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What reader cannot aprreciate the painstaking care in which Mr Giaman writes? He can show you a frightful world with love & comfort triumphing at the end.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Actually I love the additional video disc of the live performance by the group.  Was looking for this disc for years
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This back pack is fabulous.  It has a place for everything you need to traipse around with your camera and gear.  I love the strap on the side for the tripod.  I like all the little places for all the little tiny pieces of gear you need to carry with you.  Thanks for the good price and fast delivery
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My grandkids wath this movie atleast three times a day, my 1yr old Grandaughter knows some of the songs and sings along, my two GrSons, dance n sing with the movie to, they love all the colors.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Glad it came with the USB cord extension because I needed it to plug the unit into my TV.<br /><br />Easy to install and get running. Works great and is inexpensive. Even this non-techy was able to get this working the first time, with no challenges.<br /><br />Giving four stars: -1/2 because I had to wait a couple weeks to get it due to demand. Note to Amazon-- don't offer it for sale, if you don't have it in stock. And -1/2 because Amazon Instant Video (AIV) is not supported by Chromecast, which has driven me to Netflix for content. Not certain if this is a Google or Amazon decision, but as a consumer, it would be great to see AIV supported.
B00821OX98|5.0|It just holds my attention & I want to keep watching more! I cannot wait to watch another episode.  I love the storyline.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I LOVED this book. I've always thought Gaiman is a genius, but this one hit all my hot buttons. I've always loved stories where seemingly mundane events and common folk hide extraordinary, life-altering qualities if we look just a little bit further under the surface. This one fit that description in spades, especially considering the sense of alienation the main character felt from his parents, and the fact that in their practical, adult perceptions, they could be far more easily fooled than he could in his much more open and fantastical sense of life as a boy. I would highly recommend it to anyone, even those who are not predisposed to reading fantasies.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Play it daily.  Never gets old.  If you have never played it I would strongly recommend it.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Slow story that could have been told in about 75 pages at most.  I was very disappointed in the character development and redundancy of the story.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book over 20 years ago and periodically re-read it.  A classic Science Fiction novel that everyone should read.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|I saw Grizzly Bear open for Radiohead on their &#34;In Rainbows&#34; tour and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I had not heard them until that point, but even without knowing any of their material I found myself engaged.  I thought &#34;I'll have to check these guys out!&#34; but didn't get around to it until now.  I'll admit it was the song &#34;Two Weeks&#34; that pulled me into this album - a song that seems to stand out from the rest of the tracks in it's pop sensibilities - in other words it sounds like it was designed as a &#34;first release&#34; single and is different from the rest of the albums smokey soul vibe (&#34;soul&#34; not in the &#34;soul music&#34; sense but in the sense of &#34;actual&#34; soul as portrayed by the neoplatonists).  In other words it is haunting and beautiful - full of depth, longing, and reverie - a soundtrack for the inner reality and complexity of the subtle dimensions of soul.  It is one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|very  good condition, good music as described, the person I gave it to as a gift loved it. good price
B002VUFKG6|2.0|Hard to get into! I have had the book for over a month & haven't finished it yet! When I pick it up to read it I only get a few pages done & put it down again!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|OK, after using this mouse for a little over a week, here are my observations. First, the price is unbeatable for a mouse of this quality, especially when the competition is charging 4 times as much or more for their products.<br />Ergonomics are superb. It totally fits my hand perfectly.<br />Button placement is well thought out and intuitive, but a few improvements could be made to enhance effectiveness. The button behind the scroll wheel is too close to access quickly for someone like myself with longer fingers. It requires really curling my finger to an uncomfortable extent and I have to break my focus from the screen to look at the mouse so that I don't accidentally hit the DPI sensitivity button.<br />The mouse surface gets really slippery when I have been involved in a really intense fragging session and my hands get sweaty. I need to frequently stop to wipe off the surface of the mouse and my hands to prevent slipping off the mouse and/or buttons.<br /><br />Overall, this mouse is very user friendly and the software easy to understand and quickly set up profiles, even on the fly while in a game if needed.<br /><br />For the money, this a really good mouse that I hope they improve over time that puts the $100-plus gaming mice to shame. The adjustable color LED's and pulse rate are really cool features too!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Omg this game is the best for bronies like me!!!! you have to use magic to clear the darkness so you can get more rooms to get more ponys and more shops to get bits witch is money...
B004U8ZH8S|4.0|Great animation and outstanding story.  I would hesitate to show to children under 12 due to dark undertones and some violence.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Product description was perfect, price was perfect delivery was perfect. A perfect transaction…Will purchase from this vendor again as the need arises...
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|Watched this movie with my son and all his friends for a fun kid movie night.  All the crew were ready in their pjs and popcorn curled up on the couches and floor.  The movie kept saying error messages, and stopping.  I dont have any internet issues screening from other sites etc.  Finally after a 15 min phone call and several failed attempts to fix the issue the rep was able to help and the screening began, not without buffering thought.  After a while it did stop but the issues were annoying and ruined it a bit for the little ones.<br />AMAZON if your screening movies lets make sure they work! Please!
B008476HBM|5.0|Product description was perfect, price was perfect delivery was perfect. A perfect transaction…Will purchase from this vendor again as the need arises...

B007ZD17XO|5.0|I am addicted to this game!  My husband and kids are addicted to it too.  I especially like playing the expert version because it keeps you challenged.
0062238868|5.0|Absolutely love this book. One of the best books written by an actual Navy SEAL sniper. Would totally recommend this to anyone interested in snipers.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|Started off good, but just left me feeling like I had wasted my time.  Like many new writers, Mr. Scalzi seemed to lose way and just finished the novel.  Will not be giving his other works a look anytime soon.
B0017VV816|5.0|Everyone one should see this motivational movie and watch it again whenever you are feeling unmotivated and need a feel good story.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Although this version followed closely on the heels of the European version, this movie was incredibly well made.  The acting was superb.
076421120X|5.0|i believe that this devotional is perfect for anyone who wants a better relationship with his/her creator. i believe that everyone should read it!
B000OW77UU|4.0|This is a very inspiring story about perseverance. Based on a true story (who appears at the very end of the movie as he walks across the SF street).
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great story of one of the fathers of the world of communications.<br />Tesla coils are still used today.The Internet,flat screen TV,the lap top and cell phones are all part of Tesla's dreams
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Great writing - held my interest to the end, and there were lots of interesting twists and turns.  Enjoyed all the various personalities of the main characters.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Not a bad alarm clock. It could be louder. I have to put my Kindle Fire right next to my head, otherwise, I would never hear the alarm sound off! I wish they had more ear piercing sounds. I still give it 4 stars.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|misplaced the original that came with my kindle.  This one shipped fast and was able to get everything charged up before our trip.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not what I expected. A little difficult to play on the 7&#34; screen , even though in the beginning a scored very high .
B00ENBS74I|1.0|Why is this missing episode 3 this is aweful. show is awesome but it skips right to episode 4 where is episdoe 3 plz provide this. Thanks
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I am an avid sci-fi reader. I enjoy a good space opera ( think Hyperion series). I heard many good things about Dune and was skeptical about just how good it would be. Dune has turned out to be  one of my facorite reads ever. The first few chapters were ok. Then it just captured me. Dont give up on this one. It truly lives up to the hype. Understandably written, a timeless classic. Just read it!
B00006LFGD|5.0|An icon of musical genius who is sharing with other musicians ... perfectly done and I am SO thrilled to have found this.  I came across this CD by accident while looking for something else.  GLAD I did ... it's a winner no matter HOW old it is!  I HIGHLY recommend this for your listening pleasure.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Meet the Doctor & begin a journey you will never forget. Great fun and a series you WILL get hooked on.
B000001EGA|4.0|There are some scratches on the cd that causes it to skip. I totally was not expecting that. Other than that, I am satisfied.
030758836X|1.0|The first part is actually a very good read and then it totally fizzles out,<br />I got sick and tired of the two main characters and did not finish the book!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best series ever. I have read each book many times and it still is awesome best series ever
B0091LS07E|4.0|This Ak cd great.  She is very creative and has a recognizable style.  Her songs are thoughtful and wise.  Bring us more AK!!!
B005544V6A|4.0|Love the dialogues, and world play. Although it is based in a very unrealistic fact, the show is very entertaining.
B00000JFV9|5.0|I bought this again to replace one that damaged.  This is classic soul at its best.  I love Curtis Mayfield, he is timeless and o so creative.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Another great addition to the series!! Although with some loose ends being tied up in this book, I'm very curious what direction the next book will take.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I love Joe's work and he has done it again.  This cd is s romantic.  I think Joe sticks to what he does best,  & B Love songs!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|It seems the app community will not tolerate paid apps that invade privacy or put up annoying adds. This particular app has annoying unnecessary adds and it's sure to get some bad reviews today as more people install it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play a few different hidden object games, this has to be the best.  None of them can compare to Mystery Manor I like the way it levels up. all around a great game! I reset my kindle accidentally and was hummed to see I couldn't reclaim my User name if anyone knows how I would appreciate the info...Thanks
B003VB5E2E|5.0|We just put on the DVD, pump it thru the home theater , and go about doing our daily house work. Great performances.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've never been a fan of zombie movies.  However, everyone I knew was talking about this show and I had to see it for myself.  Now I'm absolutely hooked!
B00280LYIC|5.0|differed significantly from the movie which kept it an interesting read throughout.  Definitely recommend as a light hearted read for teens to adults.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Looked very good from a cinematic perspective. Plot was slow developing  and hard to it up with until about halfway through.
B00192IV9U|5.0|I love Michael Jackson's music. I love this CD. I really don't have anything else to say except I love it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of those stories that is so heart wrenching.....you need your Kleenex.  I couldn't wait to put up my Kindle and continue reading.
1400052181|5.0|This was a great book.  Very interesting subject matter and it combined science with human interest.  A little sad and heartbreaking, but thus is life.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven kept me interested from beginning to end. I have read other Nicholas Sparks books and always enjoy the plot that unfolds.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoyed the game. easy. and good graphics.  only thing is you need crystals to advance and you have to buy thing. but. what else is new?
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|I thought that it was slightly larger but it is still a good representation of Henry as Superman. I would happily purchase a nice big 76 cm version on the same figure to match my Brandon Routh Superman Returns one that I have especially if it had a cloth cape. Also to add to that the same size, 76 cm, ones of Dean and George would be even better as I plan to buy a Christopher Reeve one later in the year.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|i enjoyed it just when you think you know what going on you don't fun movie to watch get it
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|The Great Gatsby had amazing characters who played and portrayed their characters very well. Also the setting was well created. If you haven't read the book it is still a great movie.... you may be a little lost though.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it..it shows you your previous total in case you need it. I used it to help me figure out my checkbook.  Great app
B0051OZ564|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out and saw it in the theater. Just rewatched it with my sister and still think it's great. I was trying to understand why the critics almost universally panned it. I dig films that play with the frame, get all meta on you and this is one of them. The director sort of intentionally misleads the audience, disrupts the normal conventions of linear narrative and clear-cut roles. So the suckerpunch of the title really is, in one way, directed at the audience. And I think the critics just balked at the arrogance of this move by the director. By not delivering a completely feel-good piece of fluff - which may have been what they were thinking they were settling down to enjoy, what with the extremely smooth visuals. Instead, the film induces a sense of ambivalence, almost complicity, in the viewer as we find that we cannot simply turn off our critical faculties to indulge in a guilt-free gaze at the pretty women. Rather, we are challenged to consider their control and objectification - within the storyline, and by extension, the film industry and society as a whole. So I find it interesting that so many critics lambasted this movie as just that - some sort of soft porn anime-inspired female exploitation. When in my mind, that is exactly what the film is commenting on. It's like the critics didn't get it, took it at face value, or just knee-jerked reacted to their own discomfort at the implications of the film, its weird mixing of genres and glamorous aesthetics with essentially gritty realities about misogyny and a culture where the lines between abuse and pleasure are often blurred with hypocrisy and a leering eye. Or maybe they were just too uptight and puritanical to allow themselves to take seriously a storyline that intermixed a corrupt insane asylum, an oppressive brothel, and an over the top world reminiscent of a thrilling fantasy video game. As a woman myself, I found the topics presented within each level of the storyline to be intriguing, exhilarating, and emotionally resonant. And the reviews out there which imply that this is simply exploitation of girls actually deeply offend me. One, for presuming to stand for the protection of women, in that condescending way that those within that camp tend to do. And secondly, for assuming that watching fit young women in killer outfits kicking tail is only something enjoyable to perverted men, and that such a scenario is so outrageously absurd as to be insulting (this is the movies, for heaven's sake, there is no reality but what we make of it and what we are willing to accept into our mindset - do you really think most of those men in action films could actually do the things they pretend to be able to do?). I know one day this film will be truly redeemed and appreciated, and we'll be able to catch midnight shows as a cult favorite. Forget the critics and watch this movie!
B007N31ZLA|5.0|Director George Roy Hill had a hit with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1969, and four years later he brought the movie's two stars together again in The Sting. Paul Newman and Robert Redford had a natural chemistry that appealed to audiences, so the comedy adventure of western cowboy outlaws in the first decade of the 1900s was followed by the comedy adventure of eastern criminal grifters in the 1930s.<br /><br />The Sting was another huge hit, with Newman as the wise old con man Henry Gondorff, and Redford as the up-and-coming con man Johnny Hooker. All the way down the cast list you find accomplished actors, and the intricate screenplay needed just such pros to make it work. Robert Shaw portrays an Irish gangster, Doyle Lonnegan, a tough who tells one of his henchmen that he would even kill a childhood friend if necessary to preserve his hold on the mob.<br /><br />Gondorff and Hooker, the small-time grifters, are out for revenge against Lonnegan for killing one of their old con-man accomplices.  Regarding Lonnegan, Johnny Hooker says \\"he's not as tough as he thinks\\", to which the more experienced Gondorff replies, \\"neither are we.\\" Gritty realism flows through the entire film, but the story is told with a light comedic touch. Of special note is the soundtrack music of Scott Joplin, now most famous for \\"The Entertainer\\" due to its use in The Sting. Joplin's music was actually from a time even earlier than the setting of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but its spirit does seem to fit the time of The Sting.<br /><br />When a film succeeds, or when it fails, much credit or blame is due the director. George Roy Hill took this complex story, delicately balanced between tragedy and farce, and made it work. At least four sub-plots are interwoven, and each is brought to a conclusion with no loose ends. The Sting is a greatly enjoyable film, and a tribute to Hill's craftsmanship and that of his stellar cast.<br /><br />This one is so good that it is worth the upgrade to Blu-ray. There is a bit of controversy about the aspect ratio, whether 1.37 to 1 or 1.85 to 1. I am normally very sensitive to such things, but seeing both versions years apart, I noticed nothing amiss. For what it is worth, the Blu-ray picture quality in The Sting is way better than that in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have really only played about three games of mahjong so far, so am not a good judge yet but I do like it so far. The tiles are easy to read and the rules are clear. So far it is a good game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book I have read it so many times along with the rest of the series. I liked everything about this book! I give it 5 stars and recommend it to everyone!
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I enjoyed the author's account of his self-imposed memory journey, and the interspersed history of capturing words and ideas.  It's given me a lot to think about, in terms of situating my ideas about remembering in historical and contemporary ways.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great sound, great mic, extremely comfortable, somewhat durable, reasonably priced especially compared to other wireless headsets. Logitech never seems to disappoint.
B009EE4YWI|4.0|So a lot of people are complaining that this movie stinks. I don't think it's horrible at all! I thought it was good. Sea of monsters was way better but this movie isint as bad as some people say. I thought they picked great actors/actresses! Logan Lerman is my favorite actor. I do agree that the book was way better! It's not the best movie but it was pretty good in my opinion! Family friendly too.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|A few years ago I saw a bootlegged copy of this movie ; needless to say it was a very bad copy and a waste of my money not because of the movie but the poor quality of the film. When I became a amazon member I search for both movies a d got them it a great price! The story line starts off a bit slow but once the main character is introduce it picks up. I enjoy a movie that set up for a sequel to follow and this movie let a lot of room . Vin Diesel's character is a non hero but a fighter for whats right. This movie is a great chance to see how Diesel transforms to action star..
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My 2 year old loves this movie. It was very cute and funny. We have watched it a few times
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am 19 years old and I loved this book! I read it in under 6 hours and couldn't put it down! It talks all about the problems of a young boy, and it can fit into a ton of different situations with young kids growing up. I highly recommend this book for anyone! :) ~Sara M.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game play it all day!!! But they need to give away not jewels and you should be able to breed but it is still awesome I love it
B009VMN3RA|4.0|It showed a whole different side of Shirley MacLaine.  Another star who put her career above family which is always very sad.  Very well written.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I am addicted to checking the weather so I can try and be prepared for whatever we are doing that day which is why I love the weather channel app but I do wish the info w a s a little better
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I was so excited when this movie came out in theaters. When I went to go see it, my high expectations were met. The action sequences and dialogue were so well thought out and put together. When I heard who was playing the villain(Benedict Cumberbatch)  i was even mire excited. To sum up: wonderful! I love everything!
B001PPLKI0|5.0|I just love Elvis when he sings Gospel. You can feel the emotion and his rich church background in each song.
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|I've only listened to a few tracks, but I hear the Metalica influence.  I'll give a few days to sink in and then update my review.  I will say, if you're looking for something like Nightmare, look elsewhere.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was AMAZING it was hard not to cry but it was all so funny!!<br /> I fell in love with this book instantly!!
B008HK3XYK|4.0|I would say there is a threshold to how much one should pay for a tablet cover, so if you can get this for a good deal then it's worth it. Otherwise just keep your Fire naked.<br />This is a good quality case though and fits the Fire HD perfectly as it should. The only gripe I have is that orienting it so that it sits in landscape for viewing (like in the picture), while also being able to intuitively access the volume rocker and sleep button, makes it so that the camera is on the bottom. So that's weird.
B00596WEVI|5.0|Greetings<br /><br />Assassination Games, very decently filmed, goes wrong early.  Comatose people do not lie with eyes open taking saline solution and are very not dressed with full body garments, those comatose are simply sheeted and blanketed.  At age 76 the year 2012 I was abed comatose five days, pumped with saline solution, heroic antibiotics, eyes closed, thoroughly intubulated, (Foley catheters, urinal, anal, for those comatose, what goes in comes out.).  Also important.  We do not lock external doors using simple shackle padlocks.  Go with  [[ASIN:B000Z36T6Q Master Lock 6270KA Shackle Padlock]]  MasterLock's so-called \\"Hockey Puck\\" exposed lock, which cannot be removed with the most elemental bolt cutter as other padlocks would be, so must be torched-off.  Assassination Games, pretty picture, getting actual life wrong though.  Plaudits to Romania, the scenes, the Romanian film industry, the land where Assassination Games was filmed.  This film itself is a study in cinematography, presenting sepia backgrounds, colour saturated foregrounds.  Brilliant filming. We might view films for plotting as well as for technique.  Assassination Games, which plays off an earlier film, Assassins (1995), with Stallone and Bandera in the USA, presents to me technical film making brilliance.  Also see Six Bullets, another JC van Damme Romanian film.  High studies in filming technique.<br /><br />Clinton Williams in Michigan
B004P68T30|5.0|This is a tricky oral read.  The fact you can listen to the story several times ahead of attempting to read it is a real plus.  I would view this as a story for school age children versus preschoolers.
B00E9PXI3S|4.0|I have to say, when I heard that De Palma was remaking the atrocious French \\"thriller\\" Love Crime my heart sank.  The original film had an interesting premise but was hampered by the fact that the most interesting character (and vastly superior actress) disappeared about halfway through the story and what we were left with was a dull and preposterous police procedural with the main character executing an unbelievable and far fetched plot to get away with a crime.  The bad news is that De Palma has stuck fairly closely to the original's plot, the good news is that he approaches the nonsensical plot twists by veering off into an expressionistic dreamscape where things like logic aren't necessary.  It's a bold move, and not always successful, but the film is saved by a bonkers performance by Rachel McAdams, his usual precise camera work and a great score by Pino Donaggio.  All in all, it won't appeal to the multiplex crowd, but those interested in seeing something a little different, or those who are fans of De Palma's other work, should take a look.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love the game but wish they didn't make it impossible to do quests without spending your own money as you move up in the game.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I absolutely love Lindsey Stirling's music.  I had an opportunity to see her in person recently, and she is an amazing artist.  My favorite tracks to work out to!
B008XG1X18|5.0|great for recipes, craft ideas, and more.  I use it several times a week. if you want an app that gives you great ideas this is it
B009JZTQOS|1.0|When first starting the movie you think it'll be good....but then once they get to the bar scene it's like wtf. Overall, I'd say a definite no.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This show is wonderful!  It's witty and makes you think, while still being a great show!  I really enjoy the actors, and ow they portray John and Sherlock!
B004K58GSO|4.0|I will not bother to review the movie itself, other than to say it is excellent.  Even the mild shortcomings of a movie this age are easily compensated by the pleasure of watching the cast do their thing.  I'm really not that old, but I'll just say:&#34;They don't make them like that any more.&#34;<br />The Amazon Prime Video was a little jerky on this viewing.  I haven't had any issues with Amazon's video for a long time, but recently I've relied more on NetFlix than Amazon because of some minor issues.  I won't be giving up on Amazon, and I'm still assuming it is either a temporary or isolated problem.
B009LDD54K|5.0|The history enlivens the story in a mysterious place and time, long before I lived in New Jersey. I enjoy the series with my husband by my side.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Whatever the stuff on the radio is... it ain't really country.<br />Thanks to Vince Gill, here's a little collection of some fine older songs performed faithfully country AND with the benefit of today's sound engineering technology.  I haven't heard most of these songs for a long time and to hear them so well produced just makes it incredibly better!<br />If you're a country fan... especially of the Bakersfield sound... you can't go wrong with this one.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This a superb game. I played it nonstop, it's addictive fun. The puzzles are just complex enough to challange and not frustrate you. Highly recommend games from Nevosoft.  Can't wait to download Magic Academy 1.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Clever and highly entertaining. Worst move Fox ever made cancelling this series, moreover with unaired episodes. Broadcast TV does not get any better than this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read, once started I could not put it down.  Going to find more of his work and but it now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game reminds me of temple run, which is not at all a bad thing. and in some ways it's even a little better because the environment changes and it brings in characters from both movies (which I adore). You have the option to buy coins but so far I've been able to play and complete quests without needing to spend a dime. well worth downloading!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Cool dream like vistas. Holds to the story. Not a fan of hearing rap in the movie about the 20's but they tried to not be annoying which was really nice and apparently that is what you do these days to sell a movie.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book in the series, and it had me anticipating the last and final book in the trilogy.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|beyond extremely in love with this movie, great new condition and great features and beyond amazingly kool to watch love it.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|If you are a Dylan fan, you have to have this album.  It is full of gems.  The different version of When I Paint my Masterpiece&#34; is better in my humble opinion.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|love this t.v. series so much lots and lots of drama.  Love dr. Mc-dreamy. so cute!!  love all the seasons.
1400096936|5.0|A bit more stretched out than previous tales.  Somewhat harder read.  More complex web of characters. The end will decide my overall thoughts on it.  Big qustion is will the end make all the reading worth it.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Better than I heard it would be. Good action movie that is not quite up to the original movie's standards.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|In my opinion it was not well written.  It was &#34;long&#34; in the middle and did not get to the point.
0689859414|5.0|I adore this book. I've loved it ever since I discovered it in the library years ago. I've asked for it for my birthday many times. And...no one has gotten it for me. So, tonight I finally ordered it for myself! :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Don't we all long for a single understood regimen in our lives?  What a wonderful story.  Looking forward to Season 4
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting &#62;&#62;gives the &#34;correct&#34; facts of what went down, not the media's version.<br />Most of the profits from this book go to organizations that benefit the families of fallen SEALS.
B000SOYEQY|4.0|If you want a slice of a slice of the events of WWI or you want to see how history is repeating itself, this is well worth the having to fast forward during the interminable desert crossings.  Peter O'Toole is magnificent as is Omar Sharif.  Please learn anything you can about this subject from any source if you want to be an informed peace-maker.  The book, Lawrence In Arabia is a must for anyone wanting to learn more.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|this was the best love story movie i have ever saw. it had an amazing story line and a twisted ending!
140006922X|5.0|Although &#34;nothing new&#34;, the retelling of The Story from an different perspective is very revealing and very entertaining.  Not all of the facts are 100% agreed on, but the setting, the general time frame and the issues make for a cover to cover read.  I just wish the reviewers would lay off the &#34;Aslan's a Muslim&#34; critique.  There is a lot to learn and question here.  I can hardly wait to read it again.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|this was the best movie ever! it had great action and awsome story line. you will love it! you will watch it over and over!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|You could easily spend numerous hours playing this game if you are not careful. Remember you can also get Bingo if you have all balls in each corner.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun, but I hope I get to play more after giving this review as I went through a door and seemed to get stuck.
078689136X|5.0|Really got into this series.  Had trouble putting it down but have things to get done as well.  Will order his next series as well.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|First of love the game but also hate the purchasing of potions with crystals. It should atleast be able to purchased at will with in game gold. And maybe expand the tiers more randomly found. Also allow for more free user friendly make in app purchasing a want not a have to
B00C6F624K|2.0|Ofrecía subtítulos en español y no los trae. En la caja se lee incluso que estos subtítulos vienen con la película, sin embargo, al revisar el video, éste no posee más que subtítulos en inglés para impedidos. Esto definitivamente frustró y limitó mis expectativas
B004K58GSO|3.0|The streaming broke up so often that I did not finish the film.  I think the Kindle Fire needs a better antenna.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is the third book of hers that I've read and definitely was not disappointed. It's a highly unlikely situation and circumstances that would never happen but still funny as hell!! She keeps you guessing and throws in quite a few curve balls all the way to the end. Every time you think you've figured it out she changes it up. It's an amazingly cute, funny and tear inducing story.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Classic 5FDP. Back to basics sound. Head banging great time. This band continues to impress me. I recommend this album to anyone who appreciates good old metal music.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Love this movie.  Made my husband watch it and he liked it.  My niece and nephew come over and always want to see it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I began reading this book very cautiously, afraid it would be one long lament over being a woman- a woe is me sort of read. Much to my surprise, this book addressed the lack of effort on the part of both genders and inspired change and action in all areas of life- both work and home. Inspirational and refreshing.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood is definitely the queen of country.  She has a beautiful voice with so much range.  And she stick to a country sound and doesn't sound like a hybrid like Taylor Swift.  Every song on this album is great.  Gee, I wish I was Carrie Underwood!
B0068AWQQ2|3.0|It wasn't what I expected even though I will watch anything with Colin Farrell in it.  It was kind of hokey.
159463176X|5.0|I wouldn't say Hosseini's 3rd book was as great as his 1st two, but it was written very well. It was somewhat difficult to get into at first, but the book picked up, and I found myself quite interested in the lives of the many characters of this book. The way he expertly intertwined stories and lives was amazing, and not many writers can do something like that. It was a good read.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|fast flowing story, interesting concept.  The story could have been longer.  Enjoyed it... Adult Fans of Harry Potter will enjoy this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large numerals, easy to use. Free is a &quot;plus&quot;! Those with a little trouble seeing small numbers on a regular sized calculator will like this one.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|If you are looking to replace the keyboard on you android phone, this is the BEST choice.  You must try this for at least a week to allow it to recognise your typing patterns.  Once it has, it's next word predictions will save you a lot of time.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|I doesn't fit in both my cars (Acura TL and Subaru Forester). I tried in both my cars and was not able to fit in the port of car charging adapter. It was too tight to fit and was worried about my car port getting damaged by this $10 Anker charger.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|The young boys in the movie were both very good actors.  Hope we see more of them in the future.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|Finely made, durable, much less money than comparable watches from other brands. It took a little getting used to but I especially like that the large sweep second hand is in fact a stopwatch.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's amazing, I use it for english and spanish keyboard really fast and accurate. And got it for free :)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Quick moving story with a great plot. Highly recommended reading. Looking forward to the next two books in the series.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|What can I say?  5FDP is my favorite band.  If you're a fan of theirs, this album delivers.  I got a free shirt with this CD as well.  Cannot beat this at all.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The critics panned it but if you are looking for true-to-the-art Science Fiction &#34;John Carter&#34; is a perfect example. I found it refreshing, exciting, well written and well acted. A true Science Fiction work.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I had fun trying to get three stars on all the levels. It did freeze and I had to reboot the kindle to get out of it several times. But overall, I had fun.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is one movie I had to own.  Couldn't resist - the cast is amazing - the music is wonderful and the laughs are classic.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Doesn't show updates, shares and such.. Doesn't play videos well. It just doesn't keep up. I find that I'd rather use my iPhone or laptop rather than use this app.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Classic - loved this movie from the first time I saw it!  The casting in this movie is absolutely PERFECT!
0395389496|5.0|As the title suggests, this is the book that inspired the movie.  While the book provides the general framework for the movie, there are many scenes and storylines that are absent from the book.  This said, I am grading the book on its own merits while providing observations regarding the differences.<br /><br />The first key difference is the artwork itself.  The book's simple watercolors do not match the rich color and detail of the movie.  It is more akin to something that you would see in a children's book from the early 1900s.  Even so, it affords the book a certain \\"antique\\" quality that is quite in keeping with the timeless story that it tells.<br /><br />The book's construction is exceptional with heavy, glossy pages held together by a tight binding.  The book itself is contained in a very nice dust jacket that conforms very well to the book's shape.  This book is perfect for display on a coffee table around the holidays or perhaps in the room with your Christmas tree on a small table.<br /><br />The book holds an audio CD containing a narration acted by the great Liam Neeson.  (He did the voiceover for the lion Aslan in the Narnia movies.)  His deeply resonant voice flows like the Polar Express' signature hot chocolate.  The CD is perfect for playing in your children's room while they go to sleep or in the car while you drive around a country road taking in holiday lights.<br /><br />Without providing any spoilers, the book's theme is about the magic of the secular Christmas tradition.  In a way, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining a childlike sense of wonder and appreciation for Christmas.  While the book is in fact secular, it does contain an underlying message of believing in things that you cannot always see.  All in all, I am deeply pleased to give this holiday treasure 5 stars.  If you love the movie as much as I love it then you will love this book too.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Listening to this right now - I had to buy the movie and the soundtrack and am now looking in to the next &#34;More from Pitch Perfect&#34;...really never thought of myself as an a Capella girl. Ha!

B005FISC52|5.0|I am so sad this series had to end.  This was my favorite show and the only one I followed every week religiously.  I can't praise the show enough.  Miss it on tv, but so thankful I can watch it over and over again with my dvds.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book interwove the lives of sincere, everyday people in difficult circumstances with real hard consequences at stake that were undeniably relative and heartfelt to a readers conscience and an awareness of human frailty that we must all face to some degree during a reasonable length of lifetime. The author created characters in relational situations that were real and touching to the heart. She also gave us a mirror look of life in down under Australia which has a unique geographical isolationism of sorts being so far away from familiar continental locales like the USA and Europe. It added up to grand entertainment and an emotional roller coaster ride read full of life's problems, life sweeping decisions, how they can effect and mingle families into a tight thread of support and life lessons to be learned therein. The pages in the book flew by quickly even though they represented a tale not easily told.To the author's credit that takes some doing with a complex story that weaves in and out of lives in spider web fashion. I thoroughly enjoyed the premise to conclusion, the ups and downs and all the little knick-knacks in between. I highly recommend this read especially if there's a secret out there in your neck of the woods that hasn't quite come to the surface of exposure yet. And stop that silly grinning right now!  For who of us doesn't have some hidden ground around somewhere, even just a tiny speck of mud or dirt out there, in this mostly glorious worldly space of ours called life. And to hidden truths attesting to our vulnerabilities. The Husband' Secret represents a bond to which we all hold dear even if we do not want to. It's delightful reading...
B002WTC92E|4.0|This author just writes well.  You can immediately get sucked in to the storyline and genuinely care about the characters.  It's nothing profound, but a very enjoyable bathtime read.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I love lost! The 6th season does wrap up a lot of things. There are still some questions that aren't answered, but there is closure on things. I enjoyed the final season.<br />If you have not watched the previous 5 season, don't bother trying to watch this. You will be lost...
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I love Joshua Radin. His voice is amazing.  His music evokes such emotion.  I thoroughly enjoyed this cd, it was so great!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is great on my kindle fire hd. Purely awesome. I'm addicted to the ease of control. Game on.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|How can you not love Ray?  He's just magical.  His voice is so beautiful, so pure.  His music moves me.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Works good. Use it all the time on payrole for my employees. Great app for the kindle fire. Thanks a lot.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I actually bought this for my dad for Christmas.  That's all he wanted was Lion King on Blu-ray.  It's such a wonderful story and my family enjoys watching it together often.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is the first time I've played any games like this, and it seems to be fun and challenging so far.
0345803507|1.0|I got this as a set preparing to be wowed based on all the hype it was getting.  The writing is terrible, the sex is just too much and unrealistic, and I cannot believe I bought these.  To each his own, but this is not for me.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|THIS APP REALLY HELPS ME TO WAKE UP LOL SO GO DOWNLPAD IT PEPPLE now no now nlw haha hah hah ha
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I AM VERY NEW TO CLOUD.  BUT I AM SO FAR EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH IT.  CANNOT WAIT TO SEE ALL IT HAS TO OFFER.  I'M EXCITED TO HAVE IT.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Emoji pop is a really fun game. It gets your brain thinking about these differences types of emojis. OMG it's fun and you should get its a great time-waster
B008MM9630|5.0|Love the game can't put it down. A few things would be nice like being able to make pots that plants won't whither in, and to earn more gems in quests.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is an excellent movie with an extraordinary cast.  I anticipated fresh new adventures (like alternate realities) as was alluded to by the broken time-line in the last Star Trek movie.  (Maybe I was the only one reading into the broken time-line.)  From Mr. Abrams in the new Star Trek movies, I expected enough familiarity to spark my interest, enough difference with new adventures and action to thrill, clever plots to amaze, and extraordinary deliverance from the cast to keep me coming back which Mr. Abrams delivered all these and more - keep up the great work.  (I too loved the old Star Trek movies and cast.  The bar was set high by them, and we are grateful.  The new Star Trek movies by Mr. Abrams salute the original Star Trek pioneers keeping the bar high yet forging ahead as greatness should.)  Viewers Enjoy!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day does it again and again. Most excellent read. Now I CAN'T WAIT for the next one to come out!  Bam!
0345505387|5.0|I have read all the Outlander books and each and everyone is excellent reading.  I highly recommend them to anyone that likes history, only thing you must read them in cronological order.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|If Neve Campbell's The Company reveals the emotional cost of a lucratic ballet career amidst images of the joy and beauty of dance, then Natalie Portman's Black Swan reveals the psychological toll of daily dedication to grotesque physicality, amidst images of madness, social isolation, body distortion, scratched skin, nail splitting, and bone crunching.<br /><br />A combination of Portman's dramatic performance, whirlwind cinematography, and choreography force the viewer into the nightmarish self-destruction of a prima ballerina through the guidance of a smothering stage mother, a demanding dance instructor, and a sly doppelganger.<br /><br />The cinema verite style bonds together within the theme of Swan Lake, one of the world's most recognizable ballets. Several movements from the ballet tease the viewer with increasing dread of the ultimate price of perfection achieved, life itself.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Intriguing suspenseful account of a<br />Seal's life from boot camp through his<br />Operation assignments in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Compelling story .. Hard to put down!
1416972250|4.0|So many things were resolved in this story and I loved it.  It left me with a happy feeling.  I have the next two books and I was amped to see what comes next until...I read the reviews.  I do not even think I'm going to read the rest of the series after reading what people are saying about the future for our heroes.  Maybe after the next book comes out if it has some more resolution I will continue on in this series, but for now I will live in blissful ignorance.  I also am going to wait to see the movie until I decide if I completely want to invest myself in this series or not.
0385486804|5.0|I loved how personal Krakauer was about all of the characters. He provided tons of details and even gave examples of others. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading. ANY type of reading.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I love to cook and bake and with Jamie's 20 minute meals I have some great recipes to cook on week nights that won't take a long time and my family can eat sooner.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is alot of fun once you get the hang of it. Theres alot of challenges.  You can play it for a pretty long time before you have to move to some other game. Definitly worth the 20 seconds it takes to download.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|People die immediately in this story, as anyone familiar with the term Redshirts should expect. The main characters try to solve the mystery of why there is such a high rate of death on their starship, while the 5 officers come away from every encounter practically unscathed. This is a book I wasn't able to put down.
B007SGM084|5.0|Amazing! I can't wait to read it again! I could not put it down! Such a great love story! Loved it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've been wanting to read this book since the title was announced (Nerdfighter here!) and I had finally gotten back into reading when this version was only a couple of dollars on the kindle. Suffice to say I absolutely adore this book and will probably end up buying a physical copy one day.
B000JML90Y|5.0|I love being able to have this reference guide right at my fingertips. I can flip through the pages and find just what I am looking for.
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|I live for music..all music...I believe every genre from classical to country and everything in between has some beauty and value. Kings of Leon are in my opinion the most amazing, talented band around today. Yeah, first song I heard was Use Somebody. Wasn't one of the lucky \\"indie-hipsters\\" who discovered them way back when, so what? It changed my world. I went back...listened and bought everything this band has given..Youth and Young Manhood to Come Around Sundown and every hidden treasure track in between. Seen them Live 4 times...this is not a studio band..these guys sound amazing and bring it. Sound biast, obsessed even? Maybe but name me a band who has over 80ish plus tracks that are awesome? These guys don't stay stagnant..they have grown evolved and changed!  If your like many who think KOL are just 2 hit wonders...it's ok..not your fault. Kings don't bow down for the radio love. Please, trust me...research, buy this collection or any other to experience goose bumps. Their music, their story and their sound is haunting. Try it you'll like it! So hard to pick favorites but here goes...Cold Desert, Arizona, California Waiting, The Bucket, Four Kicks, Taper Jean Girl, Red Morning Light, No Money, Revelry, Manhattan,Pick Up Truck..I could go on but I think you are picking up what I'm putting down ;) New CD coming soon...sneak listen..Wait For Me...Beautiful stuff. Oh yeah and last but not least...price on this collection...amaze-balls!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|\\"I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine.\\"<br /><br />Abby Abernathy wants to be seen as the \\"good girl\\". No swearing, drinking, partying, and wearing just the right amount of cardigans to blend in with the crowd and not be always stared at. When she meets Travis, the bad boy covered in tattoos with a hot body, she knows that they are wrong for each other but she cannot stay away from him. When things get rough, she needs to leave the past behind and decide if Travis is the man for her if she can overlook both of their flaws.<br /><br />Beautiful... Heartbreaking.. Amazing...<br /><br />Perfect example of how imperfect love is. And I know that some people think that the fights they had were immature and many the characters were not being serious. But trust me. I had fights with my boyfriend over a pillow. So shush. Oh and Travis Maddox will be my new boyfriend.<br /><br />I cannot describe the feeling that I felt after this book! Usually books that have a lot of hype about them disappoint me but I totally agree with over 40,000 people that rated Beautiful Disaster 5 stars. I really enjoyed the writing style, the way the story went and thought that every character was perfectly developed. Cannot wait to start reading the second book in this series and love Travis all over again.<br /><br />\\"It's dangerous to need someone that much. You're trying to save him and he's hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\\" I smiled at the ceiling. \\"It doesn't matter what or why it is. When it's good, Kara... it's beautiful.\\"
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am one of the few who lost interest halfway through this book.  While the storyline was exciting it was too repetitive for my taste.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been some time since I have enjoyed a book this much. I'm happy to express my excitement for continuing the series. Hugh Howey did an excellent job of keeping me guessing at veiled secrets and an even better job of keeping the pressure of multiple situations incredibly high. This author captured my imagination in vivid descriptions of the silo and the characters within it. I'm not even the kind of person to review products, but after finishing this I felt compelled to.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|MAYBE it was because my previous Kindle was not the HD version but this game is much improved since the new version.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good if you need to waste time for something. need to unclock most of the games though. only start with ten
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this series! It was hard  to put down! A must read for sure. Lots of excitement and sex filled adventure. All my friends are talking about this! I recommend it to anyone
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game.  It is so fun to play and keeps challenges up to make it more appealing.  The down fall of this game is it is difficult to gain coins.  You can rack up the bananas but the coins are more limited to get to upgrade to new minions.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game because of a coworker who downloaded a soundboard of the different laughs. reminded me off him. I would recomand this. the only issue I have is that I think the loading times are a little long.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My wife and I both enjoy the show. The characters are awesome and it reminds me a bunch of Entourage.
B00DPKQ60A|3.0|I went out and bought this cd, due to the catchy nature of the first two singles. Well to be honest I listened to the whole cd and was a bit disappointed. It was a bit juvenile with lyric choices which is okay. But I expected there to be more upbeat fun songs from such a young artist with the first cd released. Most of the songs were ballads or mid tempo songs. I recommend this cd for someone that likes the slower softer songs and not the upbeat fun catchy songs.
B0062P3392|5.0|Works perfectly & no damage, when received. Product is satisfactory & same as advertised. I would definately do business with them, again
B003KRJNBW|5.0|The Book of Eli was a very good movie played by my favorite actor. I enjoyed every moment. DVD was in great shape.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|Alright here it is once and for all.  You need to listen to the record twice in order to grab the grand scope of it, and after two listens im happy to say its Brilliant. Its better than the last two DM albums, and it sounds closely similar to Songs of faith and devotion. At least to me it does.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Works perfectly & no damage, when received. Product is satisfactory & same as advertised. I would definately do business with them, again
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this game is fairly fun...the Emojis can be misrepresented at times...making the answer more difficultvthan it really is.  Also there may be a glitch in the game because when you leave it and come back to it...the letter choices are not the same.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Works perfectly & no damage, when received. Product is satisfactory & same as advertised. I would definately do business with them, again
B0060CX8F6|5.0|My 2 year old has fallen in love with Tiana story. We listen to the Cd which i think is fun and has great songs too. she gets a little scared with the demons from the other side and we hide under a blanket for second but otherwise its a good hearted love story with cute characters, a little stereotypical, like the lightingbug Ray being a bit toothless from the Bayou but all Disney movies seem to have that element in them. Overall super cute with a strong female lead that stands on her own 2 feet without being &#34;rescued&#34; by a man! Yeah!!!
B000YRY7TO|5.0|Works perfectly & no damage, when received. Product is satisfactory & same as advertised. I would definately do business with them, again
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The movie had promise.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it was a bad movie, but there were plenty of moments during the movie that could've been shorter or eliminated as they were not necessary...as well as others that SHOULD have been longer that would've helped the story.  Not bad, but predictable and not as good as it could've been.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Works perfectly & no damage, when received. Product is satisfactory & same as advertised. I would definately do business with them, again

B006VR6VSQ|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS THINKING THAT I WAS PURCHASING THE FULL SEASON 1.  IT DID NOT SAY SEASON 1 EPISODE 8... I WOUILD NOT HAVE PAID $2.99 FOR JUST ONE EPISODE....AGAIN  IT DID NOT IRPT NOT SAY SEASON 1 EPISODE 8 WHEN I PURCHASED IT....IT DID SAY SEASON 1  PERIOD........I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE MISREPRESENTATION......

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and the story --- the book was easy to read and very entertaining, great epilogue.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|A fun game that is very addicting. You could play for hours and not realize that much time has gone by
B0000CFW87|3.0|...so I didn't really listen to it, but she loves &#34;On Eagles Wings&#34; or some song like that.  That's enough words.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was amazed at how much my accuracy improved when switching to this keyboard. The autocorrect feature comes in handy.
B00009RGBS|3.0|I love this movie. Awesome cast and a great spin on legal drama. It was very entertaining. I was very impressed with the singing and dancing by A-list actors.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Can even recognize Hebrew songs, work magicly, and I love the way it looks and function. The best recognition app.
B000002VMD|4.0|Whitney's best work. I love the movie and sound track. Timeless and beautiful songs. Her voice is very special on this album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a really simple calculator that works really well. It works really fast, and is great for any problems you've got!!!! If your looking for an awesome calculator, this is definitely the one you should get!!
0800141806|4.0|This movie helped the gay rights movement. It also helped the audience have a better understanding of help issues and challenges. Awesome cast and acting.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like playing BINGO, and this was a great way to play without having to spend money :D<br /><br />I don't play it daily but when I do, I enjoy every minute of it.<br /><br />B-I-N-G-O!
630542828X|4.0|I really enjoyed the acting. The story was very good and inspirational. I became more interested in reading the book after seeing the movie. I must see for pre-law and law students.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|While this game might not have been meant for adults I find it amuzing. My 4 year old nephew has this on his ipad and after watching him for half an hour, I had to find it for my kindle.<br /><br />I spend a lot of time playing it. It is a nothing less game with challenges and such. Collect as many bananas as you can, run farther than you have before, ride the rocket or unicorn. Just watch out for those objects that will stun/kill you.<br /><br />.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|The graphics are good.  The story line is fun.  The searches are good.  I gave only two stars because I have had to remove and install twice.  When I leave the game and save progress it won't restart.  Both times at chapter 4.  If problem did not exist would be 3 or 4 stars.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|We saw this together when it ran in limited engagement at select theaters.  My 6 yr old daughter loves the show and enjoyed the Powys becoming human for this movie. I purchased the disc and she has watched it several times.  The show is fun for her and I like the messages it presents
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not enough levels, only had ten levels..  But what levels there were was fun and made you think.  Not sure I did have downloaded it had I knew it only had 10 levels.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|I'm am constantly amazed at how well the effects for TNG hold up on BluRay. This show looks better than many new shows and movies.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Mahjong on the kindle fire HD<br />Is Awesome.<br />Not only can you see the puzzle better,but it's fun to play.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Really enjoyed the take on a person's life who suffers with Parkinson's.  The scene at the convention was hilarious.  It was very encouraging to see people afflicted with an incurable disease spit in its face.  Who doesn't like a happy ending?
B006M4F67A|4.0|I always enjoy playing the mahjong games...<br />It helps pass the time while keeping your mind<br />alert.<br />Plays it's free....
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Have only played the quest &amp; have enjoyed it. Can't wait to try the other game modes. I do enjoy the variety offered.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|This movie is so great, it is funny, and the actors play their roles so fantastic together in this film and others. They are a great team.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on the series and you have to read all 3 but they are all Captivating!!! Now I'm excited to see the movies, all thought they never seem to compare... Enjoy :)
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It was pretty much what I thought it would be and I enjoyed it. It's not a great SciFi film, but it is good. Worth the $5 rental on Amazon.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is a great game! Challenging but easy enough to keep playing. My 6 yr old loves to play this too.Great graphics, sounds, and thought put into this game. Defintely a great download.
0671646788|4.0|I have just returned from a business trip and have yet to use this product.  I would love to comment on it at a later date.<br /> I have just started this product and I want to ensure I give the proper feedback to it.<br />PS The five stars rate the timelessness of shipping and receiving this product.<br />Lamont Williams
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|The frequent changes in the format and capabilities are offputting. Each time I log in there are &#34;improvements&#34; that take time and effort to use proficiently. There is more to life than staying current with Linkedin.
140006922X|5.0|As a Muslim, Reza writes with a fluid detachment which tremendously rewards the reader.  I was stunned to learn that Jesus was only active as a Messiah for 3 years.  I had never understood tumultuous times that greeted the carpenter when he set out from Nazareth.  Reza's detailed description of how the early New Testament Gospel writers curated Jesus' image to blame the Jews and exonerate the Romans explains the bitter fruit served up for the last two thousand years.  I can now see that Jesus likely did exist;  even though there were many many other Messiahs aspiring to be King of the Jews.  Reza's description of how we might best interpret Jesus when he purportedly said \\"I am the son of Man\\" left me speechless; and bears paying close attention to.  This is the sort of book which may best read in stages - even going back to previous chapters before going on.  Before you start, go to Staples (oops, I mean Amazon) and purchase one of these .7mm retractable pencils (very thin lead).  And get ready to make notes in the margin and keep Google and Wikipedia at the ready.  Spare yourself and do not discuss this book with either your evangelical or your tea-party friends.  Let's keep it a secret.  Bravo Reza.  Bravo John Stewart and the Daily Show.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|If you watched The Expendables, and opt in for The Expendables 2, you should know what you are getting. Bad Acting, worse puns, and far fetched action 'splosions. Oh, and 80's nostalgia.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved this book.  Hesitant to read it because I thought it would be depressing.  It wasn't.  It was more about life,<br />Love and how things can change in an instant.
B00AC8ZIXO|3.0|If your a halo fan you may find this more than entertaining.  If you not  a halo fan it is still not a bad B grade flick
B0002KZAKS|5.0|We don't have a ton of money to spend on more expensive microphones, but we also don't want to buy garbage.  This mic is a great mid-tier mic for those who want quality but not at a price they can't afford.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|If you like shot'em up flicks this has plenty. Some pretty good special effects and lots of action here too.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|this is an adorable movie, great for kids and adults!! i will watch this again and again, even though i'm in my twenties.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Good concept and moral, but not a particularly interesting read. A great reminder to Be Here Now, if the literary value is a little scarce.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is great for kids and adults, i will watch this movie again and again even though i'm in my twenties.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Suspense, twists and turns in the plot, intrigue, and humor. I love the Camel Club series and it's quirky members. If you're looking for something fast paced, but not terribly serious, this book series is for you.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I like books where I like at least one of the characters and prefer the antagonist to be a bit brighter
B000UZNRS2|5.0|The Camel Club series has been my newest favorite in reading. Full of suspense, intrigue, and sometimes lighthearted humor from the quirky characters. It's not a serious read, but a good one.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|Im happy that it is faster than usb 2.0 but I have found that when I connected my usb3 or usb2 thumb drives directly to the port on my laptop they are faster than when I run them through this.  It is still faster than normal usb2 but not quite as fast as usb3 direct to pc.  Still worth it just for the extra connections since my laptop only has 1 usb3 connection.  For the price cant be beat!
B000VUFJ3C|4.0|This album came first than This Is Us and i found myself enjoying this one more. I love almost every track as opposed to This Is Us who only have a few that i really like. Still, if you love BSB you owe it to yourself to get these albums cause it's like they never missed a beat. It's BSB at their best.
