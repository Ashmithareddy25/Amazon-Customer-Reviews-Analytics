B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is a keeper. Lots of features but easy to get to. And the price is right. Probably looks better on a larger tablet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Like many of the people who post frequently in the forums I read about a book a day, and I consider Hopeless to be one of the best books I read in 2012. Colleen Hoover is an excellent story teller, and in Hopeless she weaves a well-paced plot full of suspense with surprising twists and turns that captured my interest from the first pages. The themes are mature and serious. Her characters struggle with with and begin to triumph over horrific events from their childhoods.<br /><br />In some reviews readers dismiss Hopeless as worth reading because it appears to fall in the New/Young Adult Romance category. I think that categorizing it Young Adult diminishes this great story because the plot as well as the quality of the writing transcend that genre. The H and h are so much more than self-absorbed teenagers struggling with the angst of first love. They are courageous and daring in their attempts to discover the truths of their childhoods while also learning to trust and love one another.<br /><br />After I finished this book I was left wanting more time with the characters, and many months later I still find myself wondering about their lives. When the characters of a novel become so real to me that I fantasize about their existence beyond the pages of the novel, I consider the book to be literature deserving of high praise. I will read all of Ms Hoover's future books.
B00BU18U82|5.0|It is a really fun game but i have a little trouble steering but it doesnt bother me very much. I would definetly recommend this to anyone that likes simulators
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Mr Peterson says things in a way that anyone can understand.  He gives you real world, everyday uses for what you learn.  Good read!
1439165653|4.0|Had no idea what this book was about when my friend gave it to me, only that it is a \\"charming story\\". I thought it more than charming, with well-defined characters living an immigrant story from India to France with a love of food and cooking as an eventual common ground. Both the scenery and food serves the characters and storytelling that I forgot it was fiction and not about famous chefs!
0345529057|5.0|Got these for my wife to read as she recovered from back surgery.  She couldn't stop reading them and went through them faster than expected.  Had to find her more books!
B006LSZECO|3.0|.Had a hard time getting into the writing style. Could easily put the book down the first 1/3, then it became more intriguing.  Didn't care for the ending.
1612680011|4.0|Buy assets not liabilities! That is the most important concept. Most people don't understand that. A house is a liability. Most things are. You can afford luxuries  when you have true discretionary income. Read this book to find out how.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I paid for this app, used it for two weeks and am now getting an error that does not allow me to use it. The only way to fix is to buy it again.  Not a chance!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read these in two days they were so good. I love the movies to. Read this before the next movie comes out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game, though I was sad when I realized there were only ten levels...at this time. It makes you think. I had a few frustrated moments when I thought I had clicked that spot already or done everything I could possibly do, but overall great--makes you think!
B000FCJZ4K|4.0|If you never want to eat alone read this! Useful tips to influence others. Most of its common sense but then again most people need a reminder about those things. I liked it. Theres some good stories in there.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It can be hard to find movie that my whole family enjoys but this one did it. Just enough romance and action to please the girls and the boys.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|For me, like many reviewers on here Queensryche was a great band in the 80's and early 90's. However somehow they lost their way around the mid 90's and were really a band that I had pretty much given up on over the last twenty years or so (man time flies bye!).<br /><br />With all the drama surrounding their camp lately, I thought to myself who cares really. Why is anybody even bothering to discuss this band as they've done basically nothing in like forever it seemed. However, I'm here to say that kicking Geoff Tate out has obviously rekindled this band. Like many on here, Geoff Tate was one of the reasons I first was attracted to this band, well that and the great melodic riffage. Tate's vocals soared above the pounding rhythm and that was the Queensryche sound. However over time that sound somehow got lost and a change was needed.<br /><br />Well Geoff's gone and from this first post Geoff Tate release, it's quite obvious as to where the problem lied. This new band Queensryche has begun where the old band stopped in 1988. It's got that old school feel about it. Think about Warning or Rage of Order and you've got the right idea. No it's not as good as those albums were, but it as close to that sound and time as they've come in years. Some may say that going that route sounds stale or rehashed or uncreative or whatever, I say thank God! They have truly gotten back to their roots and it sounds refreshing and is definitely a step in the right direction. The band sounds awesome and Todd was obviously the right man for the job!<br /><br />My only real complaint is that its not long enough. It needs another song or two, but I'm really looking for stuff now, so that should tell you something about this release.<br /><br />Well done lads!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, I like how the game has different themes and the game art is beautiful. I only play this game because it's really addicting and kills time, I recommend it to people who like fun games and who ever played temple run , you'll like this game.
B007B8H97Q|5.0|I loved the second season, and the Christmas episode is the best! It's a half hour longer, and emotions range from very low and super sad to ultra high and supremely happy! Amazing the difference one episode makes! I absolutely love this British drama, and I hope it continues for several more seasons. The first season was a great setup and really got me to care about all the characters, even the nasty ones. This second season has toyed with my emotions and tested my patience, and there has never been a dull moment. I am looking forward to watching season three soon even though I already know that there is a major upset in it. I'll not let it bother me since I know there is a fourth season on the horizon. I love this show too much to just give up on it no matter what may come.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun. You don't go through the rooms quickly. Do it's a longer game than you expect.  Although I wish there were a hint button or some such for those really difficult rooms.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|What's not to like about this?  The actors, plot, humor, costumes, beautiful scenery, Jane Austen and happy ending.  Who could ask for more?!
B00ATUFVDW|5.0|GREAT ACTION FANTASY MOVIE AND ACTORS WITH A LOT OF DRAMA.  I WOULD LET EVERYONE I KNOW HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a fun game. it was a good game to kill time with. looking forward to updates so I can play on.
B007REV4T8|1.0|We couldn't even stay awake for this one....we won't even bother trying to watch it again.  This is the worst of the Bond movies.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Sean Penn's performance in this movie was incredible...and that's the only reason I kept watching. Oh Crap, Amazon want's me to write 3 more words for this review...and this should do it (5 words Boyah!)
0140277447|4.0|The book is well written. I was not aware of the atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the invasion of China. I learned far more than I thought I would or even wanted too when it comes to details iof the atrocities.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I liked the plot. I understood the ending....which speaks volumes about this movie when you compare it to Quantum (Crap) Solace. Would've liked to have seen more gadgetry from the new 'Q&#34; though.
B00CM9JKXU|4.0|Nothing else to really say. If you liked the 80's Queensryche, you will like this. Todd La Torre is an amazing replacement singer...and unlike Sammy Hagar and Van Halen, which I loved, this doesn't change the sound...except it makes it way better than other recent Ryche efforts! Nice job, guys. THANK YOU!
B00992CF6W|3.0|This is a great app but there is one problem, I can't get on multiplayer. I don't know if this is just a glitch but my friend got it on his kindle and so I decided to put it on my kindle but when I tried to get my friend to play on my worlds, my worlds didn't show. I am asking either Amazon or the other people to tell me what is going on please. I definitely would have given this app five stars if it worked properly. If anyone has the answer to my problem, write a comment. Thanks :)
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Such a sad story.  What a brave girl. Some of the book is hard to read.  It's despicable what she had to endure.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Such adventure I find myself right in the middle of great writing. So looking forward to the next book<br />I will tell anyone if you like romance, adventure and family. Read these books
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have so many devices and sometimes I just need to access files all the time. I set this up on all my devices and computers. I save  my phone data and photos to dropbox and then download to my computer for instant backup. I always have access to important docs, resumes, photos, music, etc.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Great comedians on their--even better together.  Even bird watching is a competitive event and enjoyed watching the competition  Thumbs up.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|cant wait for book 6 or Hbo to get the series back on.<br />will be a hot boring summer till I can get back to Winterfell
1556438850|4.0|If there is only one text book out there and this is it...fine!  Great book to read as a teacher or a practitioner.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I hate this game cuz the time is too short and its so hard to<br /> Craft things and you can mine everything with your hand and if you attack cows they come after you
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like all the elements involved. Uses many different games to find the clues. Engaged me for a few nights. Not so hard that I became frustrated and not so easy that it was boring
B006H5120E|5.0|I watched this movie 4 times at the theater.  The aura surrounding the movie and it's subject, as we all know, grabbed the nation and held on for years.  I was reserved about it re-releasing in 3-D...being gimmicky.  I have to hand it to Cameron and crew.  This was done in good taste.  No &#34;junk&#34; 3-D.  It all has it's place and it beautiful.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|It was fun but ended to soon. would like to have more levels to it.<br /><br />I would play again . Maybe it could have something happen after you build the tree houses
B0091V6TF4|3.0|The Bond themes are very good.  The second disc leaves a little to be desired.  The music was a little cheesey and not all memorable.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Keeping in mind that a person's feeling about a controller is very subjective (big hands/ little hands, long fingers/short fingers, sweaty palms/dry palms, etc.)...<br /><br />My PS3 is basically used for playing blu-rays because I dislike the controller so much. There is just something about it that makes my gaming feel loose and not as...well, controllable as my playing on my 360.<br /><br />But not any more!<br /><br />I really love this controller! If you feel similarly about the 360 controller and use a PS3, I highly recommend you give this a try.<br /><br />Had a slight issue with the controller syncing at first--but then I found the reset button, pressed it, and now gameplay is basically seamless to me. As a 360 player, things fell right into place after a few hours of gameplay.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that I would have made the control sticks the same height or shorter than those on the Xbox controller. They are a teeny bit taller and I can feel it. To me, shorter sticks mean more control and that helps me \\"keep a hand\\" on my gameplay, ensuring tighter movement. But, considering how comfortable I am with gameplay now, I'm willing overlook it.<br /><br />I'm actually enjoying (what I consider) more control over my PS3 characters when I play them now!!<br /><br />I've already preordered my Xbox One (got a Day One Edition!) and I'm debating if I really need both next gen systems before I preorder a PS4...but if this company gets on board with making a PS4/Xbox One controller, that might help push me toward a purchase (my poor wallet will recover...eventually).
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room seems to take elements from many types of games and combines them with great graphics to produce something absolutely original. So much fun!
1451627297|3.0|This was my first King novel.  I had been told they were long and worth every word, but I only found part of that to be true.<br /><br />I loved the opening portion that begins \\"I have never been what you'd call a crying man.\\".  That whole section is wonderful, along with chapter one and small sections of other chapters.  His observational thoughts and conclusions can be so dead on and well-worded that I kept a notebook nearby to jot them down.  However, the book as a whole was too long, and there were several areas that could have been cut without hurting the story.  In fact, it would have helped it.  The extra verbage weighed down the flow and lost my interest several times.  His level of detail on one element or location of the experience(s) and frequent repetition does explain why the book is so long.  I guess all of his books tend to ramble on like this?... He is a marvelous writer, and he obviously loves to write - a lot.<br /><br />Also, I prefer more science in my science fiction.  More Michael Crichton, Preston-Child type storylines where it seems a science text has gone off on a tangent or is simply having a bad dream.  However, the \\"rules\\" and considerations King brings up regarding traveling back in time were interesting and thought provoking.  It just wasn't my usual fare or really interesting enough long enough to hold my attention.  This is much more of a drama and love story than it is a science fiction tale.  And it is one of the longest books I have ever read.  It made me remember my college days, struggling through a wordy James Joyce novel or \\"War and Peace\\" (but I'll have much fonder memories of this one).
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I saw this in the theatre and then bought it for my movie night with friends. The house was packed, everyone loved it, and I'm looking forward to watching it myself a few more times!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Love it, the kids and I play it all the time, we are trying to learn some songs, and It sounds exactly like a piano..
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I enjoyed this one. Tina Fey is one funny, clever woman who tells a story that you can relate to, no matter what walk of life.
B002GHHHKG|5.0|i would recommend that everyone see this movie.  its hard to take your eyes off. the end was really unexpeted
B008220BP2|5.0|Just watched this with my teenage nieces.  We all loved it.  Fun, romantic, not at all scary.  We wish there were more movies like this.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Excellent, product, may child love it because he can play similar with the iPad but in the reality.<br />My boy love it
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|My wife and I and our youngest son (22 at the time) went to this tour at Red Rocks in Colorado; the most rare, wonderful and awesome time we've ever had at a concert. They were all there, all good (except a couple that Brian strained through, but we all let that pass)and total fun. Our son commented that he had been born too late - wishing he was our age! :-)
0316187216|5.0|See subject line. Seriously.  Old faces and new in Joe Abercrombie's latest expand the map, and raise hell doing it.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Strong album. &#34;Should be higher&#34; and &#34;Broken&#34; are highlights (although the studio versions seem to sound better), but &#34;Welcome to my world&#34; and &#34;Child inside&#34; do no move me. &#34;Slow&#34; definitely moves me. Glad that these guys keep making music and each album sounds modern and distinct. (I must say that Violator and SOFD are really special though.) By the by, the beautiful David's voice is tops!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You should totally download it because there is no better way to connect to God than the best Bible app ever!!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I am a long-time Le Carre fan but I found myself having to re-read an refer back to earlier chapters to keep up with the story line.  And, I think I was expecting more from the ending.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I saw the movie, Serenity, before I even knew there was a series before it so I kind if knew what to expect going in. I was not disappointed. This TV series is creative, fun and addictive. As many have since pointed out, canceling this show so early in its life was a HUGE mistake.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! It gets you all wrapped up in the magic of a secret garden. Was a very easy and enjoyable read I would recommend it to anyone agrees 10 to 100
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It's a mix of temple run and subway surfers. Perfect combo! My son say he want to get a phone because of this game.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie is great. We already have it on Apple TV but got it for my dad for Father's Day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Decent puzzles that are not too complicated but challenging enough to make you think. I would recommend it for a light diversion.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|This movie is great. We already have it on Apple TV but got it for my dad for Father's Day.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've been looking for a military style watch for a while, specifically this watch. I had several watches on my list, but this one always stood out above the rest.<br />Looks, great.<br />Quality, great<br />Self wind was the selling factor for me.<br />Overall I am extremely satisfied
B00684J49U|5.0|I love the writers of the show. Most of the time the show makes me laugh but there are some serious times also.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Positive, unique and funny cast that has a breath of fresh air compared to the downward trend of sitcoms and an abundance of police dramas.  Thanks new girl!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book brought up many emotions, and even though you know the ending, it was an AMAZING read.<br /><br />Had trouble putting it down !
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love it it keeps on the eddy of my set I love the colors and the way it is lade out.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Like all movies by Cruise good plot and exciting . Most of his movies are pg-13 . He can make a good action film without all the vulgarity . Jai Courtney played a good role . I also watched \\"a good day to die hard\\" fast action They can not make a die hard movie without vulgarity .I won't watch it with my grandkids But I enjoyed it and will watch it again .
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I thought I'd never find a suitable replacement for the simple and wonderful Google Reader. Then came Feedly. Beautiful on my Kindle Kindle Fire, although I keep having to login again for some reason (not every time...but frequently). Other than that little kink though, the it's awesome. I don't even cry over Google Reader anymore.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Great book as are most of the Rebus books. I have read many books by Rankin and rate him as one of my favorite authors.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|lots of interesting puzzles to figure out. a bit more initial instruction would have been helpful but we got it eventually. pretty addicting!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|If you are a fan of the TV show, or just love good country music lyrics,, you will love this CD.  My favorite tracks are No One Will Ever Love You and If I Didn't Know Better.  Who knew that Hayden and Connie had such vocal ranges, as well as being great actresses.
B000BNI99K|5.0|These songs are poetry with musical accompaniment. Rod Stewart does a better job on these old standards than he does on his rock and roll stuff.
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm enjoying this show on Amazon prime without commercial interruption. Just started watching it. Much of it reminds me of other movies (the creatures faces look a  lot like &#34;District 13&#34; creatures). Sound effects remind me of &#34;Lost&#34;. And that's OK with me, as soon as they get past all the sappy emotions it will be a great show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best running game I have ever played.You should play this game .can't wait to see what's next
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Mr. Rucker is a great singer! Loved his voice as Hootie and now the country bit is great! So happy he's helping lots of people introduce to this style of music. Plus, he's clean and fun, don't have to hide the kids' ears!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is the mega superhero popcorn flick that everyone was anticipating on seeing, and it turned out GREAT! Joss Wheldon did a great job of wrangling together all these characters, giving them exposition, and then having an awesome blow-off at the end. While Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man is always charming and charismatic, the show-stealer here is Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk. It's the guy's first attempt at the big green monster, and pulls it off effortlessly. The movie closes in on 2.5 hours, but it never truly slows down in pace. On Blu-ray, this movie comes across about as colorful and flashy as anything to hit the format! Highly recommended, and a must for the shelf!
B008K8U13K|4.0|It's pretty cool to be able to play this title on the Kindle Fire and I have to agree with a fellow reviewer in that it was also sort of unexpected. The graphics are pretty and Sonic's usual brand of speed remains intact. I also like how the levels actually rotate 360 degrees when Sonic runs through a loop-de-loop. The game can also be ajusted for either touch controls, giving you a touch joy stick and jump button on the screen, or tilt controls, the difference being that the touch controls are more mainstream while the tilt controls can take some time to master. The tilt controls are automatically used for the special stges though, but that's fine because it works perfectly. It adds a little more challenge to those stages although I have managed to score a Chaos Emerald. I recommend the touch controls since they are easier to use and are really all you need in order to play. This is hours of fun on your tablet and/or Kindle Fire and is highly recommernded for hard core Sonic fans. My only complaint is that the touch controls could be a little less sticky so I'm giving it four stars out of five. This is a lot of fun though so it's definately worth a try.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use it all the time. I can even keep up on weather where my children live. Very helpful when making plans.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Some very inspirational stories . Awesome . Once you start watching you can get hooked . Only downside is the titles to some don't give enough information to what could be an awesome presentation
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love this ap. One of the best I have ever played. I have not found any one who does not like Dragon Story and would not recommend it to a friend.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|It came in and was wrapped really well. It's in great condition.<br /> Haven't watched it yet due to some serious eye problems but<br /> hopefull soon.<br /> Betty M.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|This book reminds me of the feeling evoked by a fresh new perfume. It gives hope that even the most broken of hearts can be mended and know love and loving after all.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Helps to build my eye sight and memory which seems to be fading slowly over th  years. I do enjoy playing and trying to beat my own. Score.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and interesting game....not sure I like being mandated to rate it in order to continue to play though.... very similar to the  elevator/floor game but more detailed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is not challenging but does make you have to think, which not a lot of apps make me do. I recommend this app for it's great brainracking abilities for all ages. One thing they need to do though is add more levels, but other than that it is a great app.
B00006FI51|1.0|Despite this DVD saying that it is Universal it will not play in my DVD or my Bluray Players. It's actually PAL. Be careful before ordering
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Very informative, excellent app. keeps me updated in the latest technologies. recommended one, recently only i came to know abt this now i am using it very often. .
B0030Y11QK|5.0|This is an really good French sad comedy for people who France! I loved it!<br /><br />The whole point of the film is young dancer (Romain Duris) who is very sick and his sister (Juliette Binoche) tries to take care of him while all of these people who live in Paris have a story to tell.<br /><br />The Bluray quality:<br />Picture Quality: 5 out of 5 *****<br />Audio Quality: 5 out of *****
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Not to the expectation level. . More calcualtion options has to be provided by the devloper. looking forward for the update.
B000R8YC18|5.0|This my all time favorite Robert Di Nero that he was ever made! I was expecting it to be one of favorite movies of all time! Excellent, excellent movie for the ages of 18 and over!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I am using file explorer in my smartphone which is very useful. when i searched for my kindle this app i found and this is serving to my purpose.
B00C391Y3I|4.0|The concert is verry nice, but is a verry simple blue ray disc, doesnt have any extras at all, is just the concert
B00A77II0U|5.0|Lov it the challenger in every step , it keep me going until the end!<br />it's got easy , r hard level before u star the game,the video is really good !
B00129H7VS|5.0|The series is amazing, the sound is amazing, the vidio quality is ok.<br />It have a lot of extra material
030758836X|5.0|There are so many surprises in this tale of a marriage on the rocks, so many dysfunctional characters and relationships, that I was constantly asking myself \\"What next?\\".  Even though I needed sleep, I kept starting the next chapter. Good writing, ingenious plotting, astonishingly believable personalities, and (despite what many reviewers felt) an ending that was, in my opinion, exactly what it needed to be.
B005H8DEMG|2.0|The Tempest is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, second to A Midsummer Night's Dream, so I approached this film with optimism and excitement when I found out about it. However, it really wasn't to my liking. If you are a fan of Shakespeare and whimsical, spirited adaptations, then you might not like this one. The use of sorcery in the story would warrant special effects, yet this one missed the mark with way too much in an attempt to appear provocative. The soundtrack also seemed odd and distracting at times rather than complimentary to the movie as it should be. Disappointed. Two stars because I still love the story and many of the actors, but the overall execution absolutely sucked.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This is a great trilogy moves fast and in blu-ray it is a wonderful addition to our DVD library.  Always in the market for good movies.
B004I8WD6E|2.0|Everything about this phone is great except for one thing; the back has an angular edge rather than a rounded back, making it VERY uncomfortable to hold for any period of time.  I've only had it for two days and I'm already planning on purchasing a new case.  It is very unfortunate, because I like every other aspect of this case.  It's attractive, slim, is easy to get in and out of y pocket, provides good coverage, and has a lip in the front to protect the screen.  Also it's a great price.  Unfortunately all of the positive aspects are rendered meaningless due to the one flaw.  If amazon fixes the back I would give this product 5 stars (based on my limited experience with it.  I'm not certain how protective it would be during an actual drop, I just know that it appears very protective.)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Makes you think without feeling lost, trying to figure out what to do.  No pressure makes for good fun. It's a must get.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Legendary release from Priest. Amazing quality and sound. I have this in my player constantly.<br /><br />The blue ray version is so spectacular
B00ADIT8U2|2.0|Good:<br />  Onboard map and hints.<br />  Lots of LITTLE mini-games.<br />  No HO scenes (good for me, anyway).<br />  Not terribly over-priced.<br /><br />Bad:<br />  Techno-ish music (can be turned down or off).<br />  Graphics ho-hum at best.<br />  No real story--more like a scenario.<br />  No tidbits of Tesla trivia (a little knowledge never hurts).<br />  TONS of back-and-forthing.<br />  Lag time between tap and response.<br /><br />Played months ago--seemed like it took forever.  Much faster, not as frustrating this time (I was a newbie then).  Not a bad game, not a great game.  Played fine on both Kindle Fire 1st and 2nd gen.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is awesome. After my mom bought subway surfers tokyo, at of no where it would just change and I started playing this game and I couldn't stop playing it
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|I have been following this series and just when I think I have it all figured out, there is a twist.  Love this series!!  Looking forward to season four starting soon.
B00BSBUZPK|1.0|I am a long time fan (35 years) of the Eagles. I have an enormous amount of respect for what they accomplished in the 1971-1980 phase of their career. I am not a fan of the \\"oldies tour\\" of the past 19 years, or their last album. With that, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Positive:<br />1) The live concert footage from 1977, by itself, makes this DVD worth buying DVD. Great song selection, sound and video. The 1976/77 tour to support Hotel California may be the last time their were really friends.<br />2) The footage of when they started out in the business was interesting.<br /><br />Negative (just a sample):<br />1) Glenn Frey - Too much ego, simply put. He comes across as rude and overly harsh.<br />2) Don Henley - Boring. He doesn't offer much insight about how the band evolved. I expected more insight from someone with his intelligence.<br />3) There should have been much more commentary about songwriting process, the incredible era (the 1970s) in which they rose to fame, etc. Instead, it's basically the Don and Glenn show.<br />4) After all these years, the animosity is still there. I doubt any of them are really friends, or associate with one another outside of the endless touring.<br />5) I don't think Glenn and Don ever had an appreciation for what Joe Walsh brought to the band. Joe always seems under-utilized in the song writing.<br />6) The interview excerpts from long time friends (e.g., Bob Seger, Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther) are too brief.<br /><br />Just my thoughts.
1402270275|4.0|I utterly couldn't put this book down.  This is steampunk at it's finest. I really loved everything about this world that Bec McMaster has created. Loved how the characters are so interesting and every one of the characters I came to love, even the minor ones.<br /><br />  The main two characters, Blade and Honoria Todd seem to have this magnetic attraction to one another. Right from the start they both need to quench their desire or put a halt to it. Blade is very handsome and what women wouldn't want to sink her teeth into the man known as Blade. Blade is very deadly, but the moment he sees Honoria he knows that there's something that he has to get to know this woman and possibly do more with her.<br /><br />  Honoria and Blade are very different. Yet Honoria is in a terrible position as she is trying very hard to survive for herself and her family. Her brother Charlie is very sick. When Honoria loses her job she finds herself in a very bad spot. Yet Honoria braces herself for the things she must do to survive in the world. Humans are used for many things. Honoria decides to go to Blade for help.<br /><br />  Blade is nothing like Honoria expects. Yet Blade finds himself very attracted to her and realizes that Honoria is keeping things from him. There are reasons for this. Yet what happens is astonishing. Their interactions are intense and wonderful. I really like their conversations and their sessions, or make out sessions were great, but always something seemed to be getting in the way. Also loved that Blade went out of his way to help Honoria when she really didn't deserve it because she doesn't exactly tell him the truth.<br /><br />  What Blade and Honoria have is something so great and intense that at times I wanted them to go even further. It was frustrating that they always had something or someone coming between them. Their kisses were definitely intense. Yet Blade steps up big time for Honoria because they are starting to have feelings for the other one that neither of them can deny. When Honoria and Blade make love for the first time, it's everything you want to happen between this man and woman. It's like what you are waiting for. A decadent delight of sorts being described and what you want to happen, it's like that moment when you think nothing can go wrong.<br /><br />  Yet as this book move forward, a whole lot of things come out about these two characters past. We also learn that Honoria's father did a lot of things that he shouldn't have done, but also tried to make amends for it. Then there's how every character hates Vickers, the villain who has made life quite miserable for everyone and doesn't care. All he cares about is winning. I do love when Blade and Vickers fought in the book. It was just a wonderful moment because Blade was willing to die for the woman he loved. I thought it was very important for his character.<br /><br />  Also the fact that Blade and Honoria end up in a place that neither of them thought possible was nice. Also Blade finding that he wants this woman by his side was nice. Also like that Honoria finds herself in love with a man that she shouldn't be with, but does love him with all her heart was nice indeed.<br /><br />Rating:<br />4.5 Heartsthat neither of them can deny.

B009IH0ICG|5.0|What more can I say but it works as advertised just as its big brother does what it says it will do.  I've submitted two pics.
B008PNBU30|5.0|These guys are one of my favorite bands!!!  The album is well put together and flows seamlessly!  I hardly recognize the transition from the last song to when the disc restarts automatically.  Highly recommended!
B002FQOI0A|4.0|A very nice book. A little complicated when they talk about time traveling. Otherwise it was a pretty good book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|really enjoyed the levels but wasn't enough of them.... what was there definitely challenged me to think but like i said there weren't enough for me to really get a lot from it... hopefully there will be more to come!
B008O9V4C2|3.0|Sunken Condos is the latest gallon of Steely-Don's gourmet strawberry ice cream. It's yummy. It's tasty. And guess what? It tastes like strawberries...just like it has for decades. And if gourmet strawberry ice cream is your thing, this is a must-buy.<br /><br />Otherwise, there is absolutely nothing here that warrants expanding your Steely-Don collection.<br /><br />Said another way, the line that used to separate Donald Fagen releases from Steely Dan used to be wide. (Just listen to Gaucho and Aja, then give The Nightfly a spin.)<br /><br />Three decades on, that line is long gone. The two entities are indistinguishable. Evidently, the primary difference seems to be how much Walter Becker is -- or isn't -- involved, naturally impacting who gets the money from everyone buying it.<br /><br />Which means Sunken Condos is precisely what we've all come to expect from Steely-Don releases for 25 years. It's funky, the production is top-notch and the performances are consistently outstanding. Even if Walter decided to sit this one out.<br /><br />Maybe the next batch of strawberry ice cream from will surprise us with some chunks of chocolate or black walnuts. But I'm glad I got my taste of Sunken Condos from the public library.
B004J64QSI|5.0|There are four ways to see this, the 10 year dream cast, this 25  year cast, live in the West End, or the newer movie. Each has it's special moments and this one is performed extremely well,  Not to be missed -- there's a special bonus at the end-- if you know anything about the history of this play on the stage it will move you to tears.
B000062YAZ|5.0|An all out classic speed metal album that launched Slayer into the minds of their rabid fan base. Grandfathers of speed metal.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I immediately noticed that the richly layered textures were more than just a bit familiar to me...my way of saying that I really enjoyed having a QR cd produced by my favorite QR producer of all time...the legendary James \\"Jimbo\\" Barton...  And, on this note, I always felt that after Promised Land...Barton's last album w/ QR...things took a turn for what certainly was an interesting ride...but not my favorite chapter in QR's history.  With Barton's return to the helm as co-producer and the enigmatic vocals of La Torre and the almost rookie-of-the year-like showing of Lundgren (any relation to Todd Lundgren...also from Seattle ?)...I am sold!  This album rings truer than any single QR album...and I am talking about the original album up to and including Promised Land...there is something very pre-Rage-era about this current lineup that captures and harnesses an integral part of the QR sound that hasn't been present for nearly 20 years...maybe it's the raw energy of infusing the new talent or maybe it's the production...I'm not sure...maybe the remaining members have just kicked ass better on this one than they have in a long time...I am in 150 percent.  I will submit to all of the other positive reviews that are more specific to each song on this magnificent album as I pretty much agree with their renderings. Go Ryche!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Rarely have I read a book which captures my waking thoughts. I started recommending this book to others in the first few chapters. This book should be read by all women of all ages. The author' s reflections on the death of her mother connected me to emotions with my father 's death last August . Loved it!!!!!
B001P7HUF0|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Highly enjoyable, a great movie. Matt Damon in one of his best.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is super fun. I really liked it. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. I have a lot of fun playing this game.
B00005AREQ|4.0|Having read the rave reviews about this DVD, I bought it along with &#34;Truth&#34; and &#34;Wired&#34; as a package deal. This one required a little more time to sink in, but over all it is a good effort.
B004ZJADNQ|5.0|On the 8th studio release by the Irish/American hard rock band Thin Lizzy, changes came in new producer Tony Visconti and the disappearance of guitarist Brian Robertson.  Phil Lynott, Scott Gorham and Brian Downey performed most of the album by themselves, but Brian came back and helped on several tracks and their tour in '77.  \\"Bad Reputation\\", (1977), came out during the start of punk, i've always found punk to be a shrill form of music, only some punk was really any good, just my opinion.  Thin Lizzy was full energy on this record.  The opening track \\"Solider Of Fortune\\", kicks this album off with gold medal results, Brian does a great military drum pattern.  The punk-ish title track, great single,  should of done something, Phil's vocals strike a chord.  \\"Opium Trail\\", song about the drug problems, going on inside the band, Scott's guitar rings true here.  The melodic \\"Southbound\\", another great single was the classic \\"Dancing In The Moonlight (It's Caught Me In It's Spotlight)\\", with sax by Supertramp's  John Helliwell, great bass riff by Phil, just a great funky tune, very Van Morrison.  \\"Killer Without A Cause\\", Brian Robertson gives us some nice guitar here, he uses the voice box on this one, the melody is so addictive.  \\"Downtown Sundown\\", gives us another shot of the softer sideof Thin Lizzy, nice lyrics by Phil.  \\"That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart\\", the dramatic tune with great guitar break by Scott.  The Gorham/Lynott tune \\"Dear Lord\\", with excellent backing vocals by Mary Hopkins-Visconti, very profound lyrics here.  The bonus material, you get 5 BBC session tracks, all up too snuff and 1 soundcheck called \\"Me And The Boys\\", a tough listen, audio isn't the greatest, but it rocks.  One of my favorite 8-Tracks in high school.  \\"Live And Dangerous\\", would appear in 1978.
B000I0QKDS|4.0|This is the one with Rod Stewart on vocals, and it is a strange one the first time through the songs. I am used to just instrumentals with Jeff Beck, so this was an acquired taste.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what can I say. no glitches to report. entertaining. good memory / probem-solving game. would recommend.  wish there were more levels.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|this is one of the BEST shows on TV!  I own all 7 seasons and watch them a few times each.  Dexter is my modern day BRONSON<br />or Dirty Harry.  He brings instant JUSTICE by eliminating certifiable BAD PEOPLE.  I feel better after watching Dexter &#34;remove&#34;<br />more of society's GARBAGE.  We don't need to sit through some long trial.  We don't need to waste taxpayer's money by housing these worthless scum, while awaiting their trial, and their numerous EXPENSIVE appeals to their conviction,  In each 50 minute episode, I see revenge and accountability achieved!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|really enjoyed all the episodes . love Fairytales , was a good mix of them all between future and past. Cant wait for the next season :)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Wizards did a great job implementing this newest version of dotp for the mobile market.  I got it for the kindle fire and it works just as good as the last one did on the Xbox.
032147404X|5.0|Well-written book and very practical.  The author writes like he's just talking to a friend and sharing some photography stuff.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|(Pouting) I loved the book but I hate waiting for the next one. I do hope the next book doesn't take long to come out. Gideon and Eva are so screwed up but so right for each other it's crazy. Cary definitely needs either his own book or to have an ending worthy of this series.  I truly hope all who read these books fall in love with the characters as I have. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|Downloaded Adblock Plus for android and was disappointed. My pages took forever to load or would not at all, as soon as I turned AB off pages loaded fine. Was hoping it would work but uninstalled.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is like a mini game that you would pay $30 for about 15 years ago for 1 of the handheld gaming systems. The game is challenging, yet simple.  The upgrades to your vehicle and ability to buy more maps &amp; vehicles, which are all very Unique, put this game in my Top 3 category. Fantastic job on this one!  I do not know how this free game could get any less than 5 Stars!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Additive and challenging! I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for more rooms to come out. This game rocks!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Words cannot describe the Epicness of this CD. 10/10 I recommend this CD to anybody. The Steel Case and Paperwork with it is Awesome Too!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I have enjoyed listening to this latest Lady Antebelllum album. My favorite song is &#34;Golden.&#34; I like a majority of the songs on this album. It is not my favorite Lady Antebellum album, but definitely worth buying.
1781162646|4.0|This was a bit of a strange story, not much in the way of horror that I am used to from Stephen King but I liked the main character and enjoyed the story.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My little one has a blast in it. I wish I would of got it 2 months ago. She belly laughs in it all the time. Must have!
0756666937|5.0|My husband loved this as a gift, he is such a kid at heart absolutely adores this, great buy for any Lego fan
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a awesome and a addicting game. I have enjoyed this game ever since see I bought it, and still enjoy playing it today.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This dvd is more than just a faithful reproduction of the Frank Miller classic. The filmakers give life tol the characters through facial expressions; winks and nods, grimaces and grunts, in order to bconvey the internal dialogue persisitent in the graphic novels. The movies convey the dialogue instead of burdening the viewer with too much explanation. I was unsure at first, but it works. Genius level animation and strict adherence to the storyline makes these dvds a five star viewing in my opinion.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|When I started reading I was still mentally in the world of Brandon's previous books and found the introduction to a new world a little bit hard. As I read deeper into the book I found myself having an increasingly hard time to put it down and as I fully started to grasp the world of Roshar and its characters there was simply no way to stop. The story entered my mind and the ways of the new world dominated my thoughts even as I wasn't reading. What I liked the best was the perfect balance between hope and despair, honor and betrayal, good and bad. Thank you Brandon for this book. Awaiting the next one with great need.
0307887448|4.0|I listened to the audiobook, and even after 3 trips through this tale, I still come back to it for another occasional repeat performance.<br /><br />Im going to do this review on the audiobook in particular, but give most of my references towards the story and content because as much effort was done in the audiobook, it deserves its own review.<br /><br />Pros: The story does such a good job of portraying the reality of a future based entirely on nostalgia, that upon listening to it, I actually forget it IS the future.  References are all over this tale poking fun at and idolizing things that I grew up enjoying AFTER they had lost their popularity.  I nearly screamed in joy to hear him recite his original passphrase knowing EXACTLY where it came from and remembering the hundreds of times I must have watched that flick, eventually wearing out the tape it was recorded on.  Then to make matters more fun, the characters live almost entirely in a world where you can be litterally WHATEVER you want.  Something I know Ive dreamed about Hundreds of times.<br /><br />The person they found to do the reading did an excellent job of putting emotions of ALL types into his voice.  It wasnt another trip through \\"ben stein's memoirs\\".  It was fantastic to listen to, gripping beyond belief.  I remember someone called me while listening to this, and I wanted nothing more than to hang up so I could go back to listening to it again.  He even slips accents into a few of his \\"characters\\" to give them even further personality.<br /><br />Cons: The writing style and format is very Juvenile.  Its a hard call what age bracket this was aimed at despite all the obvious 80s references.  The insults H and Wade toss back and forth at each other are freakishly immature considering both of them are almost 18.  This is the only reason I take off a star because it does get a little annoying at times, though its certainly amusing at first.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie teaches anyone about the trees and how important they are to us .I loved this this movie, my grandson loved it also.
159562015X|5.0|I utilized the book and training materials I found online for a team training session. It facilitated great discussion on how we can communicate more effectively.
0393327655|5.0|A must read for anyone who wants to go through life free of the heinous encumbrances of belief in things super-  natural that have no place in our natural world. Abnegating reason, worshipping & prostrating our valuable, unique humanity before the manufactured idols of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam...that's no way to live. Sam Harris, the erudite, positive, humanitarian teaches us a better way.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a good game to play when your bored! The only thing is the horse walking sounds get a little annoying... other than that it's really cool
0618918248|5.0|AWESOME in the non-cliche definition. This is a stunning work of science and humanity and reason, and hurrah for all three! Daemons speaks as delightfully as he writes, so don't miss his other terrific books -- all of them -- and listen to him on CSPAN 2 - BOOK TV on weekends and on-line.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have enjoyed using this interactive game. The graphics are nicely done. My son enjoys watching the horse. Great way to pass time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|started out simple enough but got very challenging towards the end. great way to pass some time and get frustrated at the same time. Great game if you like to challenge your mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game but you should let the viewers choose like if they want Paris truthfully have Paris.<br />But author wise I love the game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Challenging enough to keep you interested but not to difficult that you give up on the game.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This app is such an escape....hours and hours of intriguing fun. This is so hard to put it down and walk away. Definitely worth paying for the full version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! so many ideas, lots of DIY ideas, food, beauty tips. I'm addicted!!!!!!!! I'm on it everyday 3 -4 times a day<br />lots of awesome ideas!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Graphics and HO panels were very good. Plot was a little thin, with almost no climax.  It just stopped! Puzzles were mediocre, some very hard, some quite easy.  In general, I give it a B+.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its very addicting. you get stuck sometimes and the answer is the easiest thing. I'm stuck on level 6 any suggestions? I'm stuck on the number puzzle ...
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's all work, no play.you do get to feed the horse and pet it, but other than that, you don't get to do any thing fun. I mean, I'm ten! And if you're reading reviews for help,you should pay attention to my review. Just because I'm a  &quot;foolish child&quot; doesn't mean  I don't  know anything. The game stinks. I can't believe I even gave it a three.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|What a fabulous debut novel,  just loved it. The characters are brilliant and Don is just perfect, I can see this being made into a movie.
B004I654WQ|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves the Cars movie.  This is great because it has the DVD and Blueray disks.  That means we can keep the Blueray and give the DVD to her friend!
B009T8XBBO|1.0|this game controls the whole phones audio settings while you are not using the app. It  doesn't let you control the volume of your own device after a little bit. NOT worth buying or getting as a gift.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|never played the game but really did like the movie. just seems odd that a total waste of flesh becomes the hero in such a short period of time.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|When the game works is fun, but it regularly closes out and I have yet to finish a game due to crashing
B008QE9XD2|5.0|how could it be bad with johnny depp in it. was expecting a comedy but got a very good dark movie with a few laughs.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great for short and long range forecasts. Easy to navigate and has option for alternate locations. Recommend this app for everyone . Helpful and i use it everyday<br />I
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Charlize Therron gave new meaning to the term evil in this one. Hard to imagine that someone that beautiful can be so bad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft sooooooooo much! It's it's super fun! But I really don't think it's worth 7 dollars.other then that it's perfect! :)
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|everyone loves to love the hero,and captain America fills the bill in that department. looking forward to the next addition
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Ok so I know the movie is out on DVD already and that I would have been easier to just watch the movie instead of reading the book but honestly I wanted to read the book first, because well I think the books are way better and at some level you can connect with the characters. And I was not wrong at all I looove this book and can't wait to see the movie now :)
B003UYV08E|5.0|Micky Rourk was the perfect pick for the bad guy in this one. he just has that bad guy look
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love how involved each floor is! This is so much more exciting of a game than I anticipated. I look forward to more rooms being developed.
B0034G4P80|5.0|a very good story line of how sometimes myths can become reality and magic can become science. really looking for thor 2
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game is addictive. I wish I had found this sooner. so far it's free. just need to progress I. skill to earn other aircraft.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and challenging! Me and my cumin stay up playing this game! And we really want to go back to Sidney to get kim!!!!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie is really good.explains how Dr got his nickname and is action packed. Opens star trek up for a whole new timeline for new adventures.
B00847KFDS|5.0|He hasn't lost his touch and his backup band is better than ever. I can play the CD several times and not get tired if it.
B00151HZME|5.0|Never heard of M83. This is my first Cd of there's. I am very happy with the purchase. The music is melodically pleasing.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I heard the song \\"Next to Me\\" non-stop on a trip to NY. Loved it. But on my Jetblue flight back to CA she was featured on a channel. I am loving this, couldn't find anything but the single on itunes so Amazon will have to do even though i can never get the music to transfer to my ipod.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought it was one of the best books I've read. No doubt. I loved it. Every single word had me wondering what would happen next.

B009C7JS14|5.0|this is awesome I love it and I'm just doing this for more features but I would recommend this app to any one who needs it. So if you need this app and like weather good for you just buy it it
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|I like Sparkle 2 much better than Sparkle HD. This game is challenging and lots of fun. The balls are bigger which makes it easier to see and you can tell more of a difference between easy and difficult levels. I have finished the game and started back over again. Well worth your time to check out.
B00A44HRG2|5.0|It is really cool you can see all all over the world even India really i play it all the time

B00ACP3OOM|2.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2DO1BLH8PTI7C]]I ordered the FINIS Neptune Underwater MP3 Player and am quite disappointed.<br /><br />I will start with the good...<br /><br />1) Sound quality in the water is great<br />2) Stays on your head pretty well as the clips are pretty tight on your goggles<br />3) Comfortable and you forget they are on sometimes<br /><br />Now for the bad stuff.. and it is pretty bad.<br /><br />When I instantly got the product I immediately charged it and began loading MP3's onto the unit.  That went really smooth and I have zero complaints.  I converted AAC files over to MP3 and the instructions that FINNIS offers has an easy step by step guide on how to do so in iTunes.<br /><br />Once the music was loaded onto my FINNIS MP3 player, things started going downhill.  First, all of the artist information is in some sort of asian language that I can not understand.  I double checked the ID3 tags which contain all of the information about that specific audio file and everything was correct.  I have no clue what is causing this and I can't seem to correct it.  It is a total guess on what artist I'm actually trying to listen to.. it is insane and frustrating.  It took me a good 45 minutes to finally create some sort of playlist on the device because I had to guess and figure out where I was navigating the whole time.  **See Video Review for the issue I just mentioned above**<br /><br />The second issue is the battery life.  I must have a defective unit for the above item but also because the battery is ATROCIOUS.  I charge my unit via the USB on my PC and the OLED screen prompts me saying that the battery is full once it is done charging.  As soon as I unplug it, it loses pretty much it's whole charge.  I have taken it to the pool no more than 15 minutes after unplugging it to only find that the battery is nearly empty even though I was prompted with a full charge.  Pretty terrible.<br /><br />I tried switching to an A/C Adapter charge and it has a different battery charging indicator than the PC.  It will tell me it is full and soon as I unplug it, I am prompted that the unit only has 1 out of 4 bars on its battery meter.  I have no idea what the problem is but it only gives me about 1 hour of music at the pool with the volume at 1/3 the max.  It is pretty ridiculous.  This has been an issue since day one minute one with the battery.<br /><br />I try to maintain it really well by following the instructions by rinsing it with clean water to get the chlorine off the unit and immediately pat dry.<br /><br />I contacted FINNIS tech support for help with the unit and their support is incredibly slow.  It takes 2+ business days to get a reply and my conversations have required numerous replies so it feels like they are dragging their feet.  They finally sent a RMA request for my unit which now means I will be missing my MP3 player for a couple weeks while they figure out why their product is inferior.<br /><br />I'm not pleased by the FINNIS Neptune and the FINNIS Tech/Customer Service.  If you are interested in this product, please proceed with EXTREME caution.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game just fine except for the pic. It is pretty small on my Kindle Fire. Makes it kinda hard to see the hiddeen objects.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a cool game I enjoyed playing it and I hope some prices go down for buying more horses/unicorns otherwise I loved it :)
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have fallen in love with the characters in this story.  The innocence of Laura.  The love her parents for one another.  Dorcas's independence and yet yearning for more.  It is a wonderful story and a beautifully staged show.  I always tell my husband how much I love my Kindle but most of all I love the Prime program that has allowed me to view such wonderful programming, free of charge.  Thank you Amazon for bringing Lark Rise to Candleford to Kindle viewing.  It is magnificent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome it is more than awesome it amazing. Everyone should play it. I thank the person who made it. J don't want to be mean but it better than temple run me temple run is all right but subway surfers is amazing.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I added this to my camping pack and it works pretty good at putting an edge on most of my knives.  The edge on some of my knives wears a little faster than others but I chalk that up to the knife material.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Lena was able to hide her claiming moon, but her mother has found a way to pull her next claiming moon out of time and hurry the process along. Lena is convinced that she has done evil things and will have to go dark, but at the same time is seduced by the mysterious John Breed and the notion that there exists a Great Barrier, where magic simply exists and does not have to be light or dark. Ethan, Ridley, Link, and Marian's new assistant, Liv, join together to try to save Lena from her mother.<br /><br />I did not think this book was as well written as the first. Characters seemed to pop out of nowhere with little explanation as to how they got there, or at least how they got there so quickly. I found myself rereading passages often because I was confused about what was going on. And as for the ending, leading up to Link's injury...while all of the characters seem to remember this final fight happening, I reread that chapter, and it simply never happened. It was a fun book to read, and I love that Lena really embodies a confused, transitioning teenager, but there were definitely some holes in the plot
B0087X728K|5.0|Let me tell you what:<br /><br />It + AMD FX-8350 + CoolerMaster GeminII S524 + AsRock 970 Extreme3 = A CPU temperature never higher than 41 C.
B007THA4FI|3.0|At first glance, this book is about a &#34;casual vacancy&#34; (caused by sudden death) on a local town council. I almost gave up because I don't care about small towns and know nothing about British politics.<br /><br />But I paid too much money for this book.<br /><br />The story began to weave around and through the mistakes people make, the lies they tell others and themselves, and how vicious ongoing gossip and self-importance can truly damage people's lives. While the story is about adults trying to live adult lives, the teens are the catalysts as they bully one another, rebel against norms, and lash out against their parents using the town website...which none of the adults even knows how to manage. None of the story is overblown or predictable, and it's easy to see how the small things in people's lives lead up to the terribly tragic ending for some, and bright rebirth for others. These are the things that happen everyday. And that's why I'm up too late on a school night; because I just couldn't put the book down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so much fun. very challenging really makes you think.<br />it is fun for all ages. love it. can't put it down.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Wow. The third book in the series focuses deeply on the troubles of war. Everyone is scheming and no one can be trusted. It took me a while longer to get into this book. There are so many more points of view, so it takes longer to get back to certain characters and the battles and intrigues were sometimes hard to keep up with. About halfway through the book, however, the author deals a HUGE blow that at once both gave me great respect for the author, while also leaving me feel very empty for the rest of the book, like I wasn't able to admit to myself that certain characters were gone. At many times it is very difficult to remember that this is just a story, and these people aren't real. Where six people may have made a claim for the throne, by the end of book three, only two of those people remain, while two siblings may be raised to battle against each other for the throne in Book Four. I can't wait to begin!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I luv it!!  its just like Mario bros. and I really really wanted a Mario bros game on my kindle fire. this app is about the same if I were you I would totally get it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The fourth book in A Song of Ice and Fire focuses in on just the characters of and around Kings Landing as they seem to be bringing a close to the war that broke out upon Robert's death. Bands of outlaws roam the roads, bringing their own brand of justice to the lords who have crushed the small folk. Cersei Lannister, trying to be the &#34;son&#34; her late father would be proud to have, hatches terrible schemes to rid herself of anyone who makes her unhappy, including her young son's beloved wife, while her brother Jaime tries to restore honor to his name by finding solutions to problems without breaking the vows he made to Catelyn Stark. As the great houses fall to the Lannister/Baratheon throne, the ironmen begin their own campaigns in earnest, crowning for themselves a new king who threatens to bring a new war to Oldtown, seat of the Citadel and training of the Maesters. The Stark sisters take on new identities to survive their own trials, but large packs of wolves are becoming a problem for everyone in Westeros, led by a large she-direwolf...and I see a connection to Arya's Nymeria.<br /><br />The books seems a bit bare, as half of the characters are missing. I know they will fill the pages of book five, but then I'm going to miss these characters. This continues to be an amazing series, and it's a real bummer to have to wait for the final books to be released.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It does the job. It tells you how long your battery will last using it for different things. I like it and it's free nothing to whine about
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a cool game to keep u occupied. it keeps u adding things and building on ur space to expand it.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|If it would function properly it would be a fun game but it malfunctions to often to be enjoyable. Very frustrating.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Another great added to the series! I read it in 1 day couldnt put it down. Cant wait dor the next! Would have given 5 stars but it left more questions then it gave answers
0517548232|5.0|A great book Dr. Ron Paul and Mises Institute recommended. if you want a basic understanding of how economics works this is it. breaks it down to an understandable level and dispels some common myths
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and its really adicting! you can choose difrent adventurers and run from evil demon monkeys all while collecting gems and getting bonuses! and best of all its free. definetly a five star game
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The story continues with just the right mount of suspense and twist.  On to the next book in the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy playing this game game the missions are fun. It has pretty nice graphics graphically the music sucks and I don't like that wants you to log on to your Facebook
B003VANOFY|4.0|Overall this is a very nice headset, very durable and the sound quality is amazing. One consistent problem I am having is that it randomly disconnects from the receiver quite often, which gets really annoying. And it comes in waves. It'll randomly d/c, reconnect and repeat every 5 minutes and then randomly stop. Really don't know why this is, people have said things like a wireless modem/router can cause the issue, so I changed the frequency on them, even turned the wireless completely off, still getting d/c's, and I have no other wireless broadcasts.<br /><br />All-in-all, it is a very nice headset and I'm glad I made the purchase, just hoping for a fix for the d/c's soon.
B0012LAO5W|5.0|NOTE: This is NOT a DVD. It's a 12\\" Laserdisc. These record album-sized predecessors of today's DVDs were visually superior. Until the advent of Blu-Ray technology, Laserdiscs were the best video format available.<br /><br />.<br />Writer/director James Cameron's original Terminator film has Arnold Schwarzenegger as a cyborg sent back in time to 1984. He's programmed to kill Sarah Connor before she can give birth to a son who is destined to lead survivors in a post-apocalyptic war against a self-aware computer network and its army of killing machines.<br /><br />THE TERMINATOR was a huge summer hit, grossing $78 million worldwide in first run vs. a $6 million cost. Its sequel, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY was long in coming, but well-worth the seven year wait. In almost every respect, this sci-fi thriller surpasses its predecessor. The concept of TWO terminators in the story equalling twice the film just may be true, thanks in large part to Robert Patrick's grimly determined T-1000 prototype, a superior poly-alloy mechanism capable of morphing into anybody (or thing?).<br /><br />Sarah (Linda Hamilton), who was understandably confused and terrified in the first movie is now confident, buff from working out, and ready for the coming conflagration. Her only obstacle is confinement in a prison-like psych ward. Arnold returns as Cyberdyne model 101, but this time his mission is to protect, not kill Sarah, and especially young John (Edward Furlong). Again, the unseen adult John is trying to make sure he lives in the pre-machine war past, and Arnold is his weapon and shield against a superior cyborg. The battle between the two terminators is epic and to the death, but first, Sarah must be freed.<br /><br />\\"T2\\" is enhanced by brilliant Industrial Light & Magic special effects and the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston. The pace is breathless, the sense of danger unflagging, and the action, mesmerizing.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.6) Terminator 2: Judgment Day (USA/France-1991) - Arnold Schwarzenegger/Linda Hamilton/Edward Furlong/Robert Patrickr poll rating.<br /><br />(8.6) Terminator 2: Judgment Day (USA/France-1991) - Arnold Schwarzenegger/Linda Hamilton/Edward Furlong/Robert Patrick
1595825045|5.0|what I really like about this book is that it do not only have the final art used on the show, but also a lot of concepts. Every episode made has a entire page of explanations in this book
B002JI94MG|5.0|After the long-dormant Star Trek franchise was revived with Robert Wise's widely anticipated but often slow-paced \\"[[ASIN:6300216802 The Motion Picture]],\\" a film that had a \\"sex with a computer\\" premise, everything was put right with this sterling follow-up effort.<br /><br />In PARAMOUNT's second Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN (directed by Nicholas Meyer), the decades seem to drop away and we're right back amidst those vintage Trek TV shows, thanks in great part to a spot on script and Ricardo Montalban's magnificent reprise of the evil superhuman of the \\"Space Seed\\" episode, marooned so long ago with 80 of his followers on Ceti Alpha V by Capt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk.<br /><br />Furthering the illusion of time stood still in this swashbuckling sci-fi adventure is Leonard Nimoy's recital of a revamped \\"Space... the final frontier\\" opening speech, also a self-admittedly aging Kirk's assignment to the equally high-mileage original USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), which has been reduced to an outmoded training ship.<br /><br />Kirk and his crew of newbies, among them Vulcan/Romulan designated commander Lt. Saavik (Alley) are on a two-week milk run that includes the infamous Kobayashi Maru simulation, when barrel-chested Khan Noonien Singh and 15 other genetically engineered survivors take control of the USS Reliant and its commander, Pavel Chekov.<br /><br />Khan and Reliant attack Space Station Regula 1, where Kirk's lover and adult son are developing a Genesis Device. After receiving Regula 1's SOS, Kirk relieves Saakik of command and warp speeds toward the station. While enroute, a surprise attack from Reliant cripples Enterprise and kills many of its green crew. Next comes a cat-and-mouse war sequence inspired by [[ASIN:6301662954 THE ENEMY BELOW]] (1957), a battle of wits between two old adversaries in which only one will survive.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.7) Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) - William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy/DeForest Kelley/James Doohan/Walter Koenig/George Takei/Nichelle Nichols/Paul Winfield/Kirstie Alley/Ricardo Montalbanan (1982) - William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy/DeForest Kelley/James Doohan/Walter Koenig/George Takei/Nichelle Nichols/Paul Winfield/Kirstie Alley/Ricardo Montalban
0740785508|4.0|the content is kind of repetitive, but it surely helps. I would recommend for the great quality you find within the text and the material
B000BF0D9M|2.0|I don't think I could stand hearing the penultimate.<br /><br />Musically tedious but technically astute, this new age pablum is ideal for not listening to while you're doing anything else but listening.  Almost every cut features the same thudding 4/4 time signature, and includes boring chordal progressions (when there are any) with the same flourishes of flamenco style playing thrown in to add \\"interest\\".  A few cuts are flavored with \\"exotic\\" percussion played in very unexotic fashion.  If your IQ is in the double digits or you find disco music rhythmically challenging, this is perfect.<br /><br />Mr. Cook sure can play guitar, but he wastes his talent cooking up this aural oatmeal.  When the title of a song is more interesting than the actual playing of it, you're in trouble.  If you're entertained by watching American Idol, you'll find this to be interesting  music.  C'mon, hop in my elevator and we'll turn it up!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved the book as It was very interesting and hard to put down.<br />Lots of info on guns and what they was using at that time.
0061438294|5.0|Interesting indeed, the book made me pay attention to people around me more.<br />It teaches you body language skills and entertaining at the same time. Buy it...especially if you work with people.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Always liked the adventures of Haviland Tuf, would like to see more. There are more aren't there? I would recommend this to anybody that likes science fiction.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super d mega awesome ! IT has awesome people.I enjoy playing this game. It is free! Play to your heart's content
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Game is a nice story, graphics are great. $4.99 is too much!. They suck you in with the FREE app only to nail you with that BIG price to be able finish. $2. maybe $3 max for this. None of the puzzles had any instructions. You had to guess your way through to maybe hit on the formula to solve it. This is very frustrating for someone who loves the puzzles. Could have given a 5 star.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|enjoyable<br />gives one an insight into the old australia<br />was not aware of the war impact<br /><br />alls well that ends well
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|When I buy into what's purported to be a trilogy, I expect it to be a trilogy.  Shame on you, Sylvia!  The series as a whole is \\"OK\\", and even if it had ended with this installment, at $30 for the three, I feel as though it's pricy for what it is.  Having said that, to come to what was supposed to be the end and be confronted with: \\"AUTHOR'S NOTE Yes, dear reader, you're right. This can't possibly be the end. Gideon and Eva's journey isn't quite finished yet. I look forward to seeing where they'll take us next. All my best, Sylvia\\"  Puh-leeez!  Not a good way to keep old fans happy (myself included) or endear yourself to new ones!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love figuring out how to get all the parts you need to move on. bring on more levels.  enjoy this game very much
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I bought this game and now all I get is a sign saying I do not own this game......it won't let me do anything else. Why do they sell games you can't play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The title of this review says it all. If you love puzzles and strategy games, then this is the game for you. Unfortunately they con you into writing a review so you can continue to play.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|it was a gift for my son and it worked for a month and no one could fix the error.
0802473156|4.0|I heard about this book during pre marriage couseling, but didn't read it.  Finally decided to pick it up and am glad I did.  I'm in a LDR and a lot of things should be common sense but let's face it, sometimes we need help.  We get lazy, are clueless, or sometimes just need something to bring us back to taking care of each other.  This book shows you the way.
B005J4TLQG|4.0|I really did enjoy watching this movie. Not sure yet if it lived up to all the hype I heard about it. I may need to get some more viewings in
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was an amazing read for me. I love Nicolas Sparks who makes romance meaningful and not pornographic. Excellent book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I think those other people are haters and this is the best . App It is an example of candy crush saga  I really love this I get to play with my friends on Facebook
B003G4W49C|5.0|Picked this up because the movie intrigued me - now I'm very happy I read this before watching the movie. The depth of Ender's character could never be portrayed on the big screen the way Card writes it. Excellent book - looking forward to reading Speaker for the Dead.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the most awesome game I know. I hope that you do to. I really like it. I'm a kid and I'm awsome=)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it love it love it on kindle fire people say u cant update it but just wait it updates its self
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|i loved this video so much and i watched it at least fifty times! little girls who are below ten will probably love this extra-special double-feature. i liked it because i like the characters' personalities. i received this product from my mother for a performance. again, i loved this video so much and i watched it last night on my mom's TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is an awesome game. It keeps me engrossed and entertained. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained for hours on end.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Pretty realistic view of growing up in a prison camp based on past family beliefs. The inspirational escape & journey to freedom was a window into the realities from a different world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun and easy to play. It gets addicting because it is fun.You get to collect keys. Which makes the game fun.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Not only is this wonderfully addictive game enjoyable, it is beautiful!!!  The colors and ability to move the cube make this game the best of the best.  I want to draw it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesomely awesome who ever made this game thank you for making this game be like temple run but the next generation
1616550414|5.0|This book is gorgeous! the pages are in full color with high quality paper, and has the official time line of all the Zelda games, Grab it before becomes rare and out of print
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great, It's a great improvement from the last one. I hope the next one will even add more stuff, powerups, and upgrades. That's if they make a new temple run
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This album is amazing, all the way through, I can't get enough of it! I love that I can play it online too
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book touched my heart dearly and still made me laugh. I would recommend this book to anyone who was looking for a good read.
1608871452|5.0|great book if your a fan of supernatural, lots of information on cast and crew, probably the best book yet, it's a big book, pity it was damaged on arrival, but well worth it if you can get it on sale
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the product because it very cool and I like the new suits for jake and tagbot only. Also you should erase spike because I think children might follow after him and spry paint everywhere. One more thing you should add new clothes for the ninja.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a great season of a great show, and it looks fantastic on Blu-ray!! Worth the price!! A great edition to any library!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it and I just had to have it. I purchased it a few years ago and it got lost at my mothers house. I've recently had the urge to indulge myself and watch this movie. Unfortunately, neither walmart OR best buy had it! I turned to Amazon and got it at a fair price.<br /><br />The movie, although quite long, is a great pick if you love older music and the beatles. The actors/singers provide a great twist to the classics that will have you humming all day! It gives insight to all the issues going on in the world during the 60's, the African American Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam war and its devastating effects. The actors are all great and perfectly casted. The music all fits in beautifully with the storyline. Not to mention Jim Sturgess amazing accent in the movie! ;)
B00992CF6W|3.0|used to love it now I don't. I'm having a really hard.time getting on to the stupid realms. then y'all are going to start making us pay?!
B002ZG98J6|4.0|I see why the ones who read the books were disappointed , but the movie was very adventurious and fast moving .
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|Very slow until about 50% reading. Good story but it was very hard to concentrate many times  I do not approve
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its so so freaking awesome so easy to lots of levels and fun lots of cool games to play on here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Makes you think. Rare thing in a game. You have to consider all the phases of water and how to change them to the phase you need.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I am often ashamed at how I devour each of Rollins books....when I know how long it must take him and so many others to produce these wonderful, informative and insightful novels. The Eye of God is another great feature...introducing new larger than life heroes and tie up some loose ends with others!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I love  it .At first it's rather easy but it gets challenging latter on in the game well worth the money.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book sucks and it makes my eyes hurt every time I read it 3 words this dictionary sucks. See  you later losers
1857885082|5.0|Very interesting look at how the English react to things, how controlled their emotions, how they act with strangers, etc. I found it helpful when I recently visited England.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I love these games, they're some of my favorites. I would recommend this to any one who likes this story play games. Although, as much as I like this game it is a little short.<br />  The first time I played it, it took, maybe a day, and that was only because of the interruptions and time out took to figure things out. But after that, it takes a couple of hours to complete the entire game.<br />  Not only that, I did buy it for $4.99, I mean I'm not complaining about the price, but for a sixteen year-old without a job $5 is a LOT. Plus its just TOO short a game to pay five bucks. I'd rather pay a dollar or even two (just some advice for the creators of these games).<br />  Also since I've been playing these games for a while I thought I should let you know it's not FREE, it's just a free trial of part of the game, it's actually five dollars, as I said before.<br />  And in closing I thank the creators of this game and a lot of the others they made, make, and are in the process of making. (P.S. I would like very much if you did lower your prices, or if not lower them then at least lengthen your games they're just too short. Also for the good of all of your other customers (not just me), I'm sure they are all in agreement with me. Other than all that, this game is great...
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I watched this show when it was originally released and always enjoyed it. The rumpled raincoat, the line, &#34;Just one more thing.&#34; and the storied.<br /><br />It's just as fun to watch today.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|Got this dvd in perfect condition. Just what I wanted and no complaints about the quality of the audio or video. Although the Cliff's is not that powerful for the old rock and roll songs, it is just perfect for the rock ballads and love songs. Thanks for the music Cliff and the Shadows.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|And it takes two weeks to get a refund. Disappointed with both Game soft and Amazon. Won't play game anymore and will delete from my kindle fire.
B00069FLC2|5.0|Fantastic audio. This dvd is so well recorded that you would not believe the sound. Even on my moderate priced home theater, the music is crystal clear and it rocks. Highly recommended for all Shadows fans. All their best pieces are here and sounding wonderful. You can see that the Shadows really enjoyed themselves on this tour. Hope that is it is not the last.
B00AYE8C70|4.0|I love using Viber for text messages. My family and friends get the messages instantly.However, I updated the Viber app and now I can't send pictures. That's the only downside I didn't like. It tells me to change the privacy in the settings, but it's nowhere to be found to let me make the change. I still use this app, but not for sending photos.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a great game to pass time and challenge your brainpower.  totally enjoyed the experience.  hope to see updates in the near future.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so shocked when Gale said there was no District 12! What the heck?! I am so amazed! Awesome!!!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I haven't read any of the Jack Reacher books, but after seeing this movie, I'm going to check them out. Non-stop action and a great story. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Can't wait for the next installment. Tom Cruise was great as Jack Reacher and I'm not particularly a fan of his.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to my friends.
0679805273|5.0|This is a great book with great meaning and of course the best turns of a phrase around. Great Graduation Present
B007W8S2MG|4.0|This is my first persona game and I love it.  It's up there with the best rpgs of all time like Phantasy Star 2, Final Fantasy 7, ys, zelda stc.  It;s a twin peaks like murder mystery/dungeon crawler but so much more.  I couldn't put it down.  Graphics sound and music are all fantastic.  Vita has some new features over the ps4 version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Hi. My name is Brenda and I'm a Pinterest addict. The app &amp; site work great, maybe TOO good, on my Kindle Nook &amp; Droid phone... I'm hooked.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|After all the SEAL &#34;wannabe&#34; flicks, this authentic reflection of how these awesome warriors actually operate is soberingly refreshing.  Packed with non-stop action and realism.  Bravo Zulu to the folks that put this excellent piece of work together.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|This book bounces around to much and doesn't go anywhere. Very slow. Will try book two and see if it moves any faster. That is why I only give it three stars.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|started with another game and moved onto this one which was attached - still playing - really like all the levels - hope it goes on for a long time!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow &amp; it's really free. Fun &amp; not stupidly hard or rediculously easy. I don't just hand out 5 stars either this was really that good.
B00785P2QC|3.0|i like it, but i would love it i could better keep track of my trucks' routes and my trash trucks would quit disappearing. I also don't like quests that are dependent on facebook interaction.
B00AK57N00|3.0|It kept me amused for a few minutes. I've played it twice and doubt I'll play it again. I'm glad it was free.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this app. Anyone looking for a weather app will find that this one has a lot to offer. I like everything about this
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Pretty good movie, but not the best 3D I've seen. I suspect it has something to do with it being converted from 2D into 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids and I live this game. They love saving up coins to buy specials, which means not spending on other things. A good life lesson.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I love this movie, despite it being intended for kids. It looks sooooo much better on Blu-Ray. worlds better. If you like this movie and have an HDTV, get this!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I haven't found a lot of free sudoku apps that are great enough for me to leave a five star rating like this one. So, this one being the free app of the day, allowed me to play a paid game and I enjoyed this one a lot better than the free ones I've played so far!<br /><br />In this game, there are eight different sudoku type puzzles, like classic and percent. There are also eight different levels of difficulty, so there's a type of gameplay that's good for everyone. When playing, you choose the number then click on the box. The bottom box of numbers allows you to put the corner numbers on (as a \\"I think this number goes here\\" but you aren't sure), which was a nice addition, since most of the sudoku apps (or at least the one I usually play), you have to hit the pencil button (or similar button) for your \\"not sure\\" numbers.<br /><br />Though it did take me a bit of time to find the settings button (located, on kindle, in the pull out menu, under the button with the lines), you can enable the hint option, which is disabled by default. You can choose the type of hint you want, which is great! You can also change the screen orientation, along with many other options, giving a greater sense of control on gameplay for the player. Very nice!<br /><br />Like other reviewers have noted, I believe the openfeint and Flurry have been taken off of the game, since I don't see it in the permissions or when I first start up the game.<br /><br />Overall, nice graphics--simple but well done. No music/sound, which is nice since a game like this doesn't need any. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who enjoys sudoku puzzles.<br /><br />EDIT, as a side note, for anyone who has problems understanding the other styles of sudoku (or even the classic one), if you go to the menu (again, under the pull out menu for kindle users) then choose \\"more\\" click on \\"help\\", there it will give you a general idea on how to play those puzzles.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book ever.... Who is going to play Christian grey in the movie? I hope that it is matt bomer
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Cajun society is like no other in America.  This movie shows the interconnections between<br />different layers of the community that is typical of Cajun society and by exposing this shows us<br />something about all humanity.
B005HEDIHG|4.0|Wanted to watch some of the old shows before I saw the new movie. They really are great! I am amazed at what special effects they have for the time period these were made in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game for anyone who loves horses. I personally wish I had a real one. But for now raising care of beauty is what I do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It really makes u think everything thru! Works well and the graphics are good too. It sorta reminds me of the movie saw without the clown guy, or dangerous stunts.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|If you want to watch a concert at home and crank it up this is a good one. ROCK ON
B004QL7K6G|4.0|I read some of the 1 star reviews and was very surprised.Both me and my wife really liked this movie .when Paul Rudd is trying to psych himself up to have sex with Malin Ackerman, we were both dying laughing! If you aren't easily offended ,watch this movie and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Very funny movie!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Great movie at home especially when you crank it up with your surround system. The neighbors probably dont like me but who cares
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So far I am enjoying this app.  Not so difficult you want to give up, but definitely makes you think.  Looking forward to new rooms.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I like this album as much or more than the last several albums that Clutch has put out.  They always stay true to their abilities and strengths and I like that.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great game cant put it down...love to see what dragons I can create!! makes you want to play all day! ! Feels like your really creating an island!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Clever,but not as easy as you think. Can not wait until there is more rooms to play and figure out.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|I'll admit the first episode was a bit grainy, but you have to realise that was a pilot episode, so the quality won't be the best. Every one after was great. No problems what so ever.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Overall a good book.  Not quite as good as the author's other books but it gave the reader the same feel of being in India.  the book like the others does an excellent job of making the characters real and showing how their lives become intertwined.  Good novel for people who like to follow characters through their lives and adventures.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a good time waster. Don't need to over think anything. Just keep tapping and you will solve it eventually. Good times!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a great game just wish the puzzel would have been a bit harder.the graphic were very good but tge story line was kinda lacking.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD. I love that the numbers are large for easy viewing. Have had no problems with it at all.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I really wanted to expand my literary background and rediscover some of the classics and Wuthering Heights was a great place to start. The characters were intriguing both easy to love and hate at the same time.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have this game on my iPhone I love it,to bad it can't be transferred from my phone onto my kindle fire.  I really don't want to buy it again so since I beat the first levels I will just continue playing it on my phone.<br /> .
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was a quick read and different then most crime novels I have read in the past. Not quite as intriguing and engaging as I would have liked but I enjoyed it.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I rated this books five stars because with a lot of sequels it isn't as good as the first. That's why I usually don't  read sequels but I had to with this series it is amazing. I recommend to anyone who loves a romantic and sort of funny book well written.
0525425772|4.0|Right up the same line with Grisham's other books in this series. Has an emotional side to it. Easy reading. Typical Grisham story-like.
B000V6I7WG|1.0|The seller was great and I got my prodcut in a timely manner, factory sealed. The movie however did not live up to the hype I had heard, the twist was something that was somewhat obvious, and the ending was not satisfying.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I like the smooth, durable case for the Kindle.  The strap is handy. The thickness is just right to protect the Kindle.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very enjoyable. I had a lot of fun finding all the items in each place. I wish there were more items to find tough.
B000002KDX|5.0|I was driving home from Florida. Music was playing in the car (naturally). The source was an iPod that I had programmed for 23 hours of play, all albums. On came America's Greatest Hits- entitled History of course!) As I listened and enjoyed I recalled just how much I had played the band's LPs during the 70's. Yet all that I had on CD was this compilation.  I made a mental note to pull out the vinyl and give it a listen and, thus, here I am now, some three months later, spinning the debut from 1972.<br /><br />Let's get this out of the way first. The critics pretty well hated the band. Robert Christogau is typical ([...] I, on the other hand, while acknowledging that the lyrics are most often no more than shallow pop, have to say that I loved the prettiness of the music from the very first notes that I heard. The passage of forty plus years has done nothing to diminish my opinion that America was a first rate folk-pop group who specialized in creating music that is great tasting candy for the ears. The vocal harmonies are pitch perfect; the acoustic guitar work innovative. On this first record the songs are almost uniformly pretty, delicate, airy, pieces of delightful fluff. After an evening of Led Zeppelin they were, and remain, just the thing for the ensuing warm summer afternoon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it all day. I found out about it when I was at my friends house. So I found it in my kindle. I love the game. BUY THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The storyline is very well done as well as the richness of the graphics. The puzzles are challenging. I enjoyed the many combinations of interactive used to solve each situation. Great game.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is very entertaining, even for adults. Funny, but full of life lessons to learn. Certainly take the time to sit down and watch this movie with your children, and don't forget to watch again every couple years as the children will surely pick up new things every time.
B000FC13UE|4.0|I just finished reading this book on the Kindle.  The bonus stories are nice that aren't included in the physical copy of the book.  I also liked the introduction on each short story.<br /><br />I liked reading the stories, some of them were a little disturbing but they were all good in their own ways.<br /><br />I was worth the money.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|trying to figure out how to get all the items for this game. might be fun once I figure it out. seems fun though. try it yourself. see if you can easily escape too!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is amazing! So much fun! I would call it G rated and G stands for GREAT! I love this game it is awesome!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I'm addicted to playing this game. I just wish you could switch between the Miami and Paris scenes like you can switch characters.
0312330537|5.0|This book is so great, one of the best I have ever read. I read alot. I highly recommend it. It's thick but I didn't want it to stop when it did end.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This update has been broken for quite a long time now yet no fix.  I have even  tried uninstalling then reinstalling and that didn't work to resolve the update issue.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I've always tried to get into this band. I just couldn't do it with the other two albums. Not that the first albums are bad, just that it's not the type of music I can dive into and fall in love. This album changes that. The songs are sooo good and catchy. From start to finish it doesn't skip a beat. I can't wait to see them live.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors (999 for short) is an amazing game that is a new classic of the DS library and adventure/visual novel titles.<br /><br />999's story is written by the excellent Kōtarō Uchikoshi, also known for his work on the 'Infinity' series of visual novel games. The script and depth of the plot intrigues and keeps the player guessing up until the end. It's one of those games with a rich in-game world filled with its own history and secrets.<br /><br />Much of the game is told in a visual novel form, where the player is reading most of the dialogue and occasionally making choices that effect the direction of the plot. There are many different endings to the game, and only after experiencing at least some of them can the player find out the dark truth behind the strange life-or-death 'game' they have been forced to play, and the identity of the culprit behind it all. This encourages replay, and really the game isn't truly over unless you've attained every ending and solved every puzzle.<br /><br />Speaking of puzzles, 999 on the DS also revolves around a form of 'escape the room' puzzles. These puzzles are interacted with via the bottom touch screen. It follows typical adventure game/point click puzzle solving formula with the ability to combine items found into something new and useful. Often, you'll find out bits of story or setting by exploring the various puzzle rooms. Within the rooms themselves, you'll frequently encore what amounts to mini-games/puzzles within the larger puzzle. Examples of this include sliding ice cubes around a tray by sliding the stylus around on the bottom screen, only unlocking the tray by dropping down the cubes into the correct slots. Games like this help keep the puzzle solving interesting, rather than simply just the point and click style of gameplay.<br /><br />999 is game that everyone should play. The story elevates itself above the normal drivel of the medium, and the brain teasing puzzles keep you on your toes--you'll likely even want a physical pen and paper to take down notes at times!--it's just a highlight of the DS system and of storytelling.<br /><br />Also of note is this game's sequel: Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, which takes places after the events of 999. It is currently available for the 3DS and Vita, and apparently a puzzle/gamplayless version of just the visual novel scenes will be released on iOS. If you play 999 and like it, then you need to also pick up Virtue's Last Reward immediately. The games tie into each other and enhance the experience dramatically. Plus, you'll be able to enjoy all of the sequel's perks such as an on-screen memo pad, 3D visuals (actual 3D on the 3DS), and voice acting! Story wise Virtue's Last Reward can be played by itself, but I highly encourage you to play 999 before you jump into Virtue's Last Reward, as the sequel contains spoilers for the first game in a major way.<br /><br />So pick up this game immediately if you like adventure games, good stories, or both!ou'll likely even want a physical pen and paper to take down notes at times!--it's just a highlight of the DS system and of storytelling.<br /><br />Also of note is this game's sequel: Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, which takes places after the events of 999.

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this is a good game its easy to get into easy to play and it gets addicting quickly so I recommend it
B007MB5OCE|5.0|One of those books whose simple absurdity imparts great wisdom while making one chuckle throughout.  Wonderful English translation preserves the dry humour.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It has a nice storyline..love the seek n find games!! The graphics could be . A little better but other than that I would play other games from these guys.
159102594X|5.0|My friend suggested this after reading the Song of Ice and Fire series (which is supposed to be two more books, Curse you George R.R. Martin!). Much smoother reading as there isn't 20 Character changes every other chapter. Character are interesting and am already on Book two.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Yes I'm frustrated this is being stretched out to yet another book.... but I thought this book was just as great as the others.<br />We get closer to Gideon and Eva as a couple and their stories continue. I love I can read more...just frustrated I have to wait for it
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I installed this on very inexpensive Android tablet and was able to send PDFs and picture files to an older Wi-Fi enabeled printer immediately. Until you register you cannot print documents and per HPs site can only print to newer ePrint enabled printers. I registered and was surprised to see it prints anything on the tablet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This has got to be the best book series that I have ever read in my entire life. Thanks for writing this Suzanne Collins!
0060574216|4.0|Good marital advise for ALL men and women to follow if they want to repair or improve their marital relationship
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I got this to listen to some good old music. It brings me back to some good memories. Was in excellent condition and fast shipping.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Like the first season, hard to turn off after an episode and go to bed made for sone late nights
B00847KFDS|5.0|Tastefully done. Really like &#34;Lodi&#34; with his sons. Paying tribute to Ike & Tina in &#34;Proud Mary&#34; was also classy.
B0072OFOM6|1.0|It will not play on my player, this is the first blue ray film that won't I love the series but will have to but the normal DVD when I can
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I bought the album then found out Boz was coming to town.  I got tickets to the best concert ever. (mostly older people in the audience and so much better behaved that when we were young).  Now the album reminds me of a great night out.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Great entertainment and good fun to watch. No complicated plot well worth the price and add to collection to watch again next year when you just want to watch a film
B0074QGGK6|5.0|What a freeing read. The book was written in the spirit of the title it bears...making it clear, credible, and inspiring. Austin, I don't know you personally, but thanks for sharing a snapshot of the world through your lens. It was well worth the price of admission.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|An awesome and addictive game. I play all five lives at least 3 times a day. The amount of time on the timer is perfect between commercial breaks.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Great game!!! You can create your own restaurant and how it looks and can also decide what your restaurants sells...... but can get boring!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like these kind of games. This one is just hard enough to be fun but not to hard to figure out!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|In the year 2093, a crew of scientists and workers such as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw with her lover Charlie Hollowy, Dave the android (Michael Fessebender), Merideth Vickers (Charlize Theron) and more were preserved in sleep for 2 and a half years as they have woken up as they work for the Weyland Corporation owned by Mr. Weyland (Guy Pierce) himself. They are on a routine mission to find the source of mankind if they have a link to an ancient race of aliens on a mysterious planet millions of miles away from Earth as they explore this uncharted world to find the answers but however, they discover that they are in danger especially when they find a living organism that creates creatures especially when one of the ancient aliens awakes from his long time slumber.<br /><br />A well made and enjoyable prequel to the popular \\"Alien\\" Saga! Ridley Scott who directed the 1979 sci-fi horror classic \\"Alien\\" returns to his sci-fi roots in this movie as director and Damon Lineouf as co-writer. This movie does have some plot holes but you have to remember that some movies aren't always perfect, the story is quite complex and there is visually stunning backgrounds/sets that hark to H.R. Giger's vision like in the original film with nice visual effects with both CGI/practical effects with good modeling too and good performances. It's a fascinating film about what if life was made by aliens and how we got to see early hints of chestbursters, facehuggers and even a bit of xenomorphs.<br /><br />This blu-ray 4-disc set is outstanding! you get 3D BD, regular BD, bonus features BD and DVD/digital copy versions. The picture and sound quality are out of this world as are the extras like deleted scenes with alternate beginnings/endings, The Weyland files, The Weyland Corporation achieve-photo gallery, 2 commentaries and a really neat 3 and half hour documentary on the film, a bargain!
B00368PSN2|5.0|Jim Caviezels just good in whatever movie he's in and this is no exception. You have aliens,dragons and Vikings also you have the great John Hurt,and Ron Perlman who is a great character actor. This is a great sci -fi movie and worth buying.
B004WKOCP8|3.0|Instead I got another album like Morning View.  Love Brandon's voice and the band is as tight as always, but where are the guys who made S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Light Grenades?  Is BB in love again?  lol.  It's a good album, but not what I wanted to hear.  Maybe it's me who changed....
B000F5GJNC|4.0|This version was closer to what the original literature or story was about and this movie was actually filmed in Iceland. I'm  not the biggest Gerard Butler fan because he simply cannot hide his thick Scottish accent which most good actors are able to do nowadays. I had the same problem with Tony Curran in The Thirteen Warrior. I also found it amazing whatever role Sean Connery played he had the same problem and he's considered one of the greatest actors ever. Anyway I thought this movie was better than the newer computerized version with Ray Winstone, Brenden Gleeson film, judge for yourself.
0571288006|1.0|I seldom write reviews, but 'Death Comes to Pemberley' was so appalling that I need to write this one.  On the one hand, a classic, witty novel, with richly drawn characters, and on the other, one of the greatest ever crime writers; most fans of both would have been excited at the combination.  It is hard to believe that this book was even written by someone who has actually read P&P.  The characters were vapid and two dimensional, and the plot crude. And without wishing to give anything away, why is Lydia never brought into the story after her husband is jailed?  She isn't even mentioned during the trial, although she was a prime witness in the carriage?  It seems wrong to be writing this about something written by James, but it really is not a decent example of her work.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|i'm sorry to say that this book could have been reduced in halve and the plot would not been effected .dan you a terrific writer but i think you lost your way with this book . take a long vacation and  firer your editor and start again on something new
B00006CXSS|5.0|I loved the production and direction this film has. The actors were picked perfect for their roles. Very well done! Lots of action that looks very realistic
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love a the challenges. Great game. Need to play more. Just wish there were more levels. What other games do you have like this?
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Van the Man is at it again. No track on this CD is bad.  If you're a Van fan, you'll LOVE this one!
B000UGS97U|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old (along with Wicket). I was a little worried that he would be too small, but he is a good size to cuddle with and my son loves him! He's also definitely better looking in person than in the picture shown here. My son also loves that the little pouch that he comes with opens up, that was a plus. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Star Wars stuff, this Chewie is super cute!
B007CKNX28|2.0|I heard one of the songs from this CD on the radio in Houston and decided to give the CD a try.  It's a good compilation.
0142501123|5.0|The book is a classic and my kids loved it and now I am buying t for my friends' kids.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|How can one NOT like this DVD?  Captain America and Iron Man make the movie work.  LOVE IT!  You will too.
0333710932|5.0|The book is a classic and my kids loved it and now I am buying t for my friends' kids.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun, like to do the levels with the kids. It's a &quot;video game&quot; that makes them think.
B00007FOMP|5.0|This was truly one of the best albums of all time. The social commentary and vocal and music skills exhibited in 1971 made this a monumental landmark album. One of Marvin Gaye's best (if not his best). I bought it to replace it from being ripped off from my collection years ago. And also the congas and percussion used to get that inner city message across to the universe. A job well done!
B0011Z939M|5.0|Lots of good cuts here.<br /> Rock and Roll to the nth degree!<br />I'd like to hear that &#34;How many more times on FM radio now a days,<br />Ha!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Love this author.  Full or mystery and entertaining.  Good read to the end. Always enjoy her books, some more than others
B00138CYD4|5.0|I wish it had some newer tracks but it's real good working music. Pop in the buds and roll 'n spray  away.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is a awesome game better than minecraft! If you get it you will love it and it is hard to stop playing. And i could not believe it was free! It is the best game ever so if you get it rate it 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|enjoyable game. Tricky and makes you really think. worth downloading and would recommend this definitely. good game. nice graphics and responds well.
B006PERRMY|1.0|While the premise of this movie (money is literally time!) is not novel, it is interesting and I looked forward to seeing the movie. Unfortunately, the premise is ruined by the plot -which is absurd and has too many inconsistencies to be taken seriously.<br /><br />We are told that prices are constantly going up. Yet whenever prices go up, the characters in the movie act shocked. Basically, when their wallet, printed on their arm, goes to zero, they die. Their wallet also ticks down during the day. So, some careful budgeting is required. Yet people routinely cut things to the last second then realize the transportation they need to get home has experienced one of the many previously mentioned price hikes so now they are out of luck.<br /><br />We are also shown that crime is rampant in the city and you can kill people and take their money from their arm. How much sense does it make that people would be walking around with the equivalent of thousands of dollars of benjamin's taped to their forearms?<br /><br />But anyway...apparently this advanced society apparently hasn't invented ATM's or paypal or remote money transfer yet. In one hilariously inept scene, Will's mother has only an hour and a half left to live but two hours walk until she can reach Will! (who will give her some more time I guess). So she decides to run. At the same rime, Will realizes something is wrong and starts running down the path towards where she would be. I don't know about you, but I can easily, easily run two hours worth of walking in an hour and a half, and these people are all permanently frozen at age 25 and thus in excellent shape.<br /><br />In such a future, you would have ATM's sprinkled about and ways for people to transmit and receive money remotely - and in fact, we SEE SOME OF THESE WAYS LATER IN THE MOVIE. But alas, Will's mom dies comically and hilariously right as she flies into Will's arms and before he can give her the handshake of life. Why didn't he just wire her like..20 minutes? We are shown that technology for the remote transfer and tracking of money exists. Every family would have a shared account set up for just situations like this.<br /><br />The movie also mentions that the constant price increases are a dastardly plot by all the evil rich people to curb overcrowding...these are the very same rich people who apparently let everyone live for free until the age of 25 and then give them a years salary, for free. Needless to say...even if every single person was dragged out and shot at age 25 the population would still keep increasing because of all the sex and child birth and what not that happen during those wild teen years and early 20's. The evil guys evil plan to prevent the world from being overpopulated doesn't even pass the laugh test.<br /><br />It's hard to take a movie that earnestly tries to present a new vision for humanities way of living remotely seriously with such glaring inconsistencies and plot holes. Suspension of disbelief is fine, internally contradictory and incoherent world building is not.
B00D8WMASM|5.0|Cole, you made a classic with this one..... This albums is one I'll be playing years from now, Hip Hop is not Dead!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Wow!  With such a line-up of great actors, who would have thought this could be such a stupid, boring movie.  I know it's all about re-incarnation, etc. But this was poorly done.
B00797MB0O|4.0|Dreadfully, comically dark . . . I love Charlize Theron and I love her in this movie.  She makes you hate her and want to shake her but you still feel bad for her.  I love movies like these.Even my boyfriend, who would never watch this on his own, really got into it.  It's one of those laugh-as-you-cry things; if you want a feel good movie, don't bother. But, if you have a but of a dark sadistic streak in you, watch this.
1449437524|3.0|You can read pretty much the whole thing for free on the authors website. If it were priced a little cheaper, I would recommend it more.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I love kik, and use it daily-But every time I have to restart my tablet(Velocity Cruz T301) I have to uninstall, redownload, and then install it again. Truely a good app, but seriously. I am done with this installing crap. Would have given it a five, but they need to work out the bugs.<br />D:&lt;
B001M790RE|5.0|Rancid did an excellent job coming up with this album. They covered every emotion on this slamming CD. They  are a great band and can't wait for the show this month.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A classic--what more can you say?  Love being able to have it with me to read anytime with the kindle edition
B003KNDMXG|5.0|If you simply like fun music, then Janelle Monae is pretty much a sure thing. Like a great movie, it is enjoyable, but deeper than you might expect.
0446547654|4.0|Loved it. It's a great read and I was able to receive this purchase very quickly and for an affordable price.
B000BZISTE|5.0|This has always been on my top five favorite movies. After watching again it has moved to the number one spot.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I got Behringer Minimix Mix800 Ultra-Compact Karaoke Machine with Voice Canceller And Fx as well.  I compared the two and decided to keep Behringer Xenyx 802 Premium 8-Input 2-Bus Mixer with Xenyx Mic Preamps and British EQs.  There are couple of reasons:<br /><br />(1) more inputs<br />(2) better mix quality<br />(3) more control buttons<br /><br />Behringer Xenyx 802 Premium 8-Input 2-Bus Mixer with Xenyx Mic Preamps and British EQs has drawbacks too.<br />(1) no power button, which means you need to unplug it when you don't use it.<br />(2) the power adapter sucks!  Not standard connection.  Very loose and easy to broke off.<br /><br />Solid build.  I think it is a good buy.  I would recommend it to my friend.  But I really wish they fix the power adapter problem and add a power switch button.  Also it will be nice if they include 1/4 inch cables or connection converters.  :--)
B0085FF55W|5.0|I bought this cd for one song, Hero, and ended up loving almost every tune on the cd. They are a fun group to listen to for all ages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very fun. It's a great way to pass the time!!<br />I can't wait for them to add new levels so I can keep playing.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|best battery app I've used. very light on memory usage in both space and ram, and incredibly accurate with it's battery life estimates .
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This is a simple, but challenging game. By simple I mean that is has no super elaborated graphics, nor out of this world effects. It isn't complicated either; very easy to play with. The story is nice, the challenges and powers that you have are cool. Personally, I can't play it for more than 20 minutes, but maybe others can get deep into it and play nonstop.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Too short or it would get better rating. 10 levels and its done. Should have made it longer before releasing.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Parties giddy with delight, parties up in arms. MAN OF STEEL's reaped enough box office duckets that they can for sure green light that Justice League movie. But MAN OF STEEL was always going to make money, even if it had sucked copious bat guana. If you loved the movie, I envy the he11 out of you. I wanted to love it. Instead, I'm ambivalent. I liked it okay, did not love it. I think Mark Waid's scathing review has merit. MAN OF STEEL falls short of my expectations. Mostly, it's the adaptation I'd dreaded Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder would produce: overly somber and ponderous and absent of that twinkle in the eye with which Richard Donner's 1978 version has charmed generations.<br /><br />The narrative unfolds in non-linear fashion. It occasionally skips back to Clark's childhood past but not in sequential order. I was cool with that approach. If anything, I wish there'd been more flashback moments with young Clark and his parents. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are solid in fleshing out Ma and Pa Kent, with Diane Lane providing the film's emotional linchpin. Russell Crowe's take on Jor-El is the most kickasss incarnation of Clark's biological dad yet. I thought he was fantastic, before and after he died. I love Amy Adams so I won't discuss her Lois Lane. I did like that sequence in which she proves her mettle as a Pulitzer Prize reporter by back-tracking the trail of good deeds done by that mysterious good samaritan.<br /><br />Speaking of whom, Henry Cavill is tremendously buff and earnest and humorless as Clark Kent. It's weird but there were moments in which he resembled Tom Welling. I don't know how to feel about that. I thought, overall, Cavill does a fine job with what he's given to work with. It's almost as impressive as his dating Gina Carano.<br /><br />The sometimes iffy trajectory of plot and character shortchanges the film. Equally debilitating, Cavill and Adams have minimal chemistry. I guess I'm crying out for that classic Lois & Clark banter. A huge positive is Antje Traue who as Zod's Sub-Commander, Faora-Ul, is attractive in a ruthless, genocidal kind of way. On the field of battle, Faora impresses as someone even more lethal than Zod. The film showcases her application of super-speed much better than it does Superman's.<br /><br />It's a Nolan and Snyder joint, and we should've predicted the dark and incredibly serious tone. There are some good bits, even some great bits. It is visually stunning. For the most part, it's an exhilarating spectacle. But while the film focuses on the majesty of the Man of Steel, it's missing that sense of joy. One of the few times that the film really captures the spirit of Superman was during Clark's learning-how-to-fly sequence, which, by the way, trumps John Carter's learning-how-to-jump-really-high sequence. Clark's gleeful grin when he finally stabilizes himself in the air is pretty awesome. I anticipated more joyful scenes like that. There's a crap1oad of epic CG-generated action set pieces - and, yay, we should celebrate a big screen Superman who goes ba11s out in exhibiting his otherworldly skills set - but the final 40 minutes are so overwhelming and unrelenting that there eventually is this desensitizing effect.<br /><br />The \\"You are not alone\\" broadcast inspires a genuine frisson of disquiet. Sucks then that it's undermined by the sheer lack of suspense as to who's transmitting the message. For a film loaded with the actiony stuff, too much exposition goes down in which things are told to the viewer rather than shown. Paraphrasing a conversation between a scientist and some grunt who should've known better:<br /><br />- Scientist: \\"They're terraforming!\\"<br />- Grunt, on cue: \\"What's that?\\"<br />- Scientist: \\"Well, terraforming is a process in which yada yada yada...\\" (You get the picture.)<br /><br />Further stuff to ponder and also this ***SPOILER*** tag (you've been warned):<br /><br />- MAN OF STEEL is still miles ahead of SUPERMAN RETURNS. The one cool scene in SUPERMAN RETURNS? Bullet bouncing off the eyeball.<br />- Jenny Olson spends a huge chunk of her screen time in need of rescuing, so thanks to whoever thought up the gender swapping for a long-established character. What was the point? Somewhere, Katee Sackhoff is laughing her a-- off.<br />- It's baffling that Clark isn't stronger than these Kryptonians newly exposed to yellow sun. Clark had only been soaking up the sun's rays for, like, all his life.<br />- What's up with Clark's finding his spiffy Superman suit on a ship that's supposedly been buried in ice for over 18,000 years?<br />- When Clark steps into the suit, it doesn't feel like he'd earned it.<br />- As a tornado descends on the highway and everyone flees, but the Kents' dog gets left behind in the car, it's ridiculous that it's Pa Kent who goes back to fetch the dog, instead of his son who, spoiler alert, is friggin' superhuman.<br />- I don't buy Pa Kent's sacrifice. You can't convince me Clark was willing to just stand there and watch his dad die because the world isn't ready yet for what he is. Bu11crap!<br />- In one flashback Pa Kent advises boy Clark that he was wrong to save the bus full of drowning children because it might have exposed him. WTF? Which leads to this next one...<br />- Pa Kent needs to have a beer and a chat with Spider-Man's Uncle Ben.<br />- What does it say when a film either plays it so coy or is so embarassed of its source material that it shies away from calling our guy \\"Superman\\"?<br />- For a hero who's supposed to be so concerned about saving lives, Superman seems awfully oblivious to all the folks in danger while he was punching and getting punched thru the cityscape. The casualties must've numbered in the hundreds of thousands, easy.<br />- That was an awkward, unearned and uncomfortably extended kissing scene between Clark and Lois, given that in the backdrop you can see the smoking ruins of Metropolis and its people trying to pick themselves up.<br />- I miss Teri Hatcher and Margot Kidder. And Dana Delaney.<br />- Michael Shannon's Zod kneels before Terence Stamp's Zod.<br />- And, yes, the most controversial element is Superman snapping General Zod's neck, thanks to Snyder and script doctor David S. Goyer's need to explain Superman's aversion to killing. Why must you explain why someone doesn't want to kill? Isn't it enough that he doesn't want to kill? I don't at all buy that Superman had no other recourse but to kill Zod. This act absolutely jettisons what he stands for. It redefines Superman. It lowers him to Wolverine's level. Superman's killed before in the comics, so it's not like it's unprecedented. But this just smacks of being incredibly contrived, with Snyder and Goyer intent on making their mark on the Superman mythos.<br />- The Clark Kent (finally with glasses) that we see in the last two minutes or so is pretty great. This is the Clark Kent I was waiting for, warm and awkward and human and not vigorously waving that messianic flag.<br /><br />Okay, finally, (and, again, SPOILERS!!!!) here are a few things Clark could've done besides celery stalking Zod's neck:<br /><br />- Tell that endangered family to MOVE, dammit.<br />- Cover Zod's eyes.<br />- Distract Zod by telling him Terence Stamp is talking smack behind his back.<br />- Using a raspy voice, whisper in Zod's ear: \\"I'm the g0ddamned Batman!\\"<br />- Ticklefest.e in SUPERMAN RETURNS?

B005K17RU0|5.0|Absolutely love this app.  Works great on my kindle...  I like the fact how detailed the weather app is especially the day predictions.
B00AECGQF2|2.0|Paid for it and it did not download onto my kindle. I am upset that I lost out on my money because the app is dumb.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|Two records,sound great,completes my Hendrix collection.And that is all I have to contribute about this purchase,now please find out where my Cobham album is.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The app is really cool I love it I want to find herobrine on the app  it is so fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a totally awesome game. Temple Run is talked about more, but I think that this game is a much better runner than Temple Run 1, at least. It even gives Temple Run 2 a run for its money. (Get it?:)There are tons of characters and outfits, and the graphics are more well done. There are lots of missions and challenges, and you can compete with your Facebook friends. This is an overall totally great game and I would highly recommend getting it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it because it is humorist, to me it's not just for kids it for adult too. So they can enjoy a nice story time.
0199653488|3.0|is not so good as I was expected. Too expensive and not of excellent quality. For example the perspective of greek law was not very good
B000V4NX04|4.0|Lives of Others is very well written and acted.  It offers a glimpse into the human aspects of the insidious dehumanizing growth of totalarian survellance bureaucracies. Quite timely especially in light of widespread awareness of the invasions of privacy we all live with today.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The most thrilling book that i have read in awhile. I recommend this to anyone that's liking for thrills along with romance
030759565X|2.0|After all the hype I was looking forward to trying the recipes in the book. It was selected by my cookbook club for our dinner meeting. The head notes to the recipes are too wordy and personal and not helpful to making the recipe a success. Several of the recipes sounded good but the flavors are not well developed. There is a lack of seasoning. There is no technique and there are times when technique is needed. This is probably because she has no training. The best dish was the Sugar Snap Pea Salad with Miso Dressing. The cheese Rosemary Gruyere crackers are quite good but the recipe needs liquid; the dough is very dry and difficult to work with esp. to get 100 crackers. The Tomato-Scallion Shortcakes with Whipped Goat Cheese were okay however the dough has too much liquid and it wasn't a short cake at all; Sesame-spiced meatballs and smashed chickpea salad pretty good but monochromatic; Broccoli Slaw good but nothing new, the kale with Cherries and Pecans too many calories and definitely for those who don't like greens with all the cherries and pecans; Zucchini Ribbons with Almond Pesto looked pretty but was rather dull in taste. The Corn Risotto-Stuffed Poblanos okay tasting too much work for the result.  The Seared Halibut and Gazpacho Salsa with Tomato Vinaigrette the fish needs a light brine to add flavor the gazpacho salsa...really and the tomato vinaigrette added nothing to the dish it needed herbs.  The desserts peach Peach Dumplings with Bourbon Hard Sauce-well this isn't a dumpling it is more of a galette and the baking times were off and the dough too moist. The  white chocolate pudding with blackberry curd was missing something it needed some acid to brighten it and the white chocolate pudding was too rich paired with the curd. I wish the recipes were tested. And remember it is a book from a self-taught home cook, wish I did.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game it makes you really go into detective mode. Math is also part of your escape solving and the color part of it is like a memory game it self.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Ok I normally don't review movies but I put off buying this one cause of the bad reviews. I've read the book it was somewhere around 23 hours long and the movie was 2 hours so come on you cannot put 23 hours into a 2 hour movie. So that being said the movie was fantastic. The lead actress played a fantastic part. I thought this was a great adaptation of the book. I know there are going to be 2 more books in this series so I really hope they make more movies in the future too... I am glad i bought this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love the game, except for sometimes the game won't load. Also trying to figure out how to earn more things is frustrating.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I just reviews the digital copy that i bought on Amazon because of the bad reviews. As i said in that review you can't put a 23 hour book into a 2 hour movie. This movie was fantastic and the main actress played a fabulous part. I might actually buy the blu ray now also just so i have it. I loved it... I really hope they come out with more movies whenever they finish the books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has kept me entertained for hours, this app is SO much fun. This is a MUST GET app! Will entertain kids for hours, guaranteed.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|My husband and I both really like watching the Shield on Amazon instant prime! It is easy to navigate to get into and find shows and movies, we are very happy with our instant video on Amazon Prime. It also saves your spot so you know where you left off and can continue with the next show!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|His undiminished quest for excellence is an inspiration for everyone. He is a person everyone can relate to and aspire to be like.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very intriguing. Sometimes too much of the sex details. But the revealing episode is breathtaking;) The movie must be very interesting if they make it.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|This is the best value if you can use the entire set.  These hold up well to heat and dishwasher.  The built in rest is great because I hate washing a spoon rest every time I cook.  The colors are pretty too.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Can you please put a limit on the number of jewels of generosity a player collects and move on to another jewel? Or maybe allow so many (25) of them to be traded for a needed jewel? Also can you take the 5 credit limit off the credits allowed to collect in the news feed? Can you also get rid of the limit on the credits we can receive in our mailbox? If I get five on the news feed I cant receive any from my mailbox.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have played this game on my cousin's tablet. I recommend it. Good for all ages! I love this game!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Works well. Enjoyed the new artwork. And the campaign is still fun. Cant wait to pick up my promo card.hopefully they update with new content through out the year. Perhaps with the block that follows.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|The authors present an interesting but not always convincing thesis on development and failure - this argument seems appropriate for certain countries like the USA

0894803123|5.0|You're probably about to get an ice cream maker and wondering if you should add this to your order.  Yes Yes Yes.  We just bought an ice cream maker and this book made all the difference.  It doesn't cut corners or go diet on you.  It's all about living life, a big smile, and some of the best ice cream you'll ever taste.  The book also shares the Ben & Jerry's story.  It's a great inspiration for all and especially entrepreneurs.  Enjoy!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am still a bit overwhelmed by the captivating tale Mr. Hosseini has written. It sweeps over time, continents, and emotions to show how our everyday lives link. It's about family, duty, honor, loyalty and love. Mostly, the story shows it is never too late to be a part of someone or something.
0894803123|4.0|Out of publication, but has many basic and off the wall flavors that made what ben & jerry selections are all about.  Good ice cream information was the best part of my interest.  Just a vanilla person myself.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's the update it been like one month when the other mobile devices have it. So what is the problem?
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is very entertaining and keeps my son busy for hours lol.I think this app is one of the best apps in the world!!!!!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|My kids and I couldn't figure this one out.  Maybe it would be fun if we knew how to play it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A very touching story. All pet owners will love and treasure this for a long time. Beautiful tale for families and children--anyone who loves a simple and beautiful tale about a wonderful dog and his owner.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I read the book, so it was one of those \\"the movie didn't explain as much as the book\\" scenarios.  Although even viewed as a standalone movie, it wasn't all that great.  Go see Dead Alive instead.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Different perspective on great CCR songs.  This s a fun album. It gets better each time I listen to it.
B00000DWHG|5.0|last album that keith moon played on.  not their best but better than later albums. best song is who are you
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a very fun app but like I said it needs more levels hopefully we will get them soon.
B000002KIT|5.0|one of the all time great live albums. starts with jailbreak and ends with the rocker. has one of the best one-two punches in history with a cowboy song and the boys are back in town
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I've played..I love playing this when I'm bored! I really do enjoy playing thus game. Five stars.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My kid likes this book and he read it so much I gave him a test of the book and he got an a+
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|Installed on my first generation kindle fire but force closes every time I try and open it.  Like the other 1 star reviewer I have tried removing the app and downloading it again multiple times with no avail.  The amazon app store is running very short on quality games. Developers like G5 seem to come out with plenty of new games for google play or ipad but not for kindle so I was looking forward to playing this. Lame.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Amazing guns I love this app but the only problem is that there's not enough guns I believe there's only five guns please add more guns please
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Another good game to keep me occupied. I like the fact that there is a story and each step is part of a bigger objective.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a really fun game but it could have been harder. I cant wait until they update it. hopefully they will make it a lot more challenging.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|This game and reviews looked pretty easy and the concept is one of my favorite type of game to play.<br /><br />However, I must have missed something.  The controls are not easy to manuever and I bump into everything.  I tried it both with the touch option and the tilt option.  I got motion sickness with the tilt option..but that is more my fault then the game.  If that type of game upsets you, I'd pass on this.<br /><br />There was no clear place to stop.  I'm supposed to<br />stop at the next store, but if I chose pause then it gave me menu options, not stop the boat.  I just kept on ramming into each house I sped into.<br /><br />Again, great concept.  I'm not an idiot when it comes to playing games or manipulating the phone but I had to unistall because bumping into things was not my idea of a fun game.<br /><br />Edited:  Since I must have missed the directions somewhere, I went back in it and gave it another go.  The first time I played, it did not automatically stop the game when I reached the end point (the shop)  .  Second time around, the boat stopped where it wad supposed to and I was able to buy/sell items.  That part of the game I enjoyed.<br /><br />Because of this second run, I did increase fr my 2 star rating to 3 star.  Controls are still not great (I just used the touch).  It's a good game to waste time once in a while, but I have other games that do that better for me.
B0091UGEVY|4.0|Enjoyed the concept of a new way to look at an old fairytale. My daughter loved it. Would recommend this movie.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|MAN OF STEEL delivers one of the most visual and dramatically rich films of the year.  Brilliantly crafted and realized by director Zach Snyder, the film wastes not a moment in weaving a complex tapestry that redefines the greatest superhero in history on an unheard of epic scale.<br /><br />And make no mistake, this is the Superman of the 21st Century.  Director Zach Snyder and writer David S. Goyer have combined elements and touches of the most definitive Superman comics and graphic novels of the character's last 27 years to insure MAN OF STEEL is a faithful reboot, unlike Bryan Singer's failed \\"Superman Returns.\\"  References and scenes abound from `Man of Steel,' `Earth One,' `Secret Origin,' `Battle of the Supermen,' `Birthright,' `Last Son of Krypton,' `Secret Identity,' and `New Krypton,' along with the New 52 re-launches of `Action Comics' and `Superman.'  Snyder and Goyer also courageously mix in new mythological elements that address our own world's controversial geo-political issues, all of which are grounded in the character's high morals and science-fiction mythos.<br /><br />Those with pacemakers, heart conditions or in walkers better get out of the way - this is also 21st Filmmaking at its best.  Snyder has become one of the leading stylists in a new breed of directors who mix film stocks, exposure speeds, camera movement styles, visual effects and processing textures for narrative purposes - and he's never been more in tune with his gifts than he is here.<br /><br />At times, the tone and drama of the dialogue and performances fly at you just as fast as his visuals, with each line and intonation as vital as his visual effects.  The extended opening on Krypton is layered with as much philosophy, religious contemplation, and environmental debates as it is with stunning renderings of technology and creatures.<br /><br />Yet, Snyder takes time to slow down when emotion, performances, earthbound reality, and narrative tone demand it.  Writer David S. Goyerhas structured his screenplay in a fashion similar to \\"Batman Begins,\\" which he co-authored with MAN OF STEEL co-producer and co-story author Christopher Nolan.  While Nolan maintained a consistent pace and stylistic approach in \\"Batman Begins,\\" while cross-cutting `timelines' in that film, Snyder utilizes stylistic shifts to allow his visuals to become a visceral extension of Goyer's screenplay structure and dialogue.<br /><br />With regard to the film's performances, the casting could not be more perfect.  Henry Cavill embodies his triple roles as Kal-El, Clark Kent and Superman with levels of subtlety, regret, humanity, humor, compassion and - above all - humility.  He paces himself in each scene as `evolution' is the key demand of the role.  This is really a Clark Kent story, as film reveals to Clark just who he is and who he is destined to be.  In the first half, Cavill portrays a Clark Kent expressing loneliness, heroism, determination, and - yes - wit and humor as he wanders the country, struggling with a personal crisis - who am I, and what should I do?  Once he discovers his Kryptonian heritage, and identity as Kal-El, he `suits-up' as Superman.  Tragically, he must immediately face General Zod and his troops.  Cavill is a Superman who has yet to be anointed with that name by the people of earth.  Worse, he has yet to gain their trust.  For the balance of the film, we witness a Superman learning how to use his powers, protect the people of earth, and realizing you must have faith in people first before trust can be established.  It is a lesson he instills on the US military - those who most doubt his insistence he is a loyal American, through and through.  By the end of the film, Cavill delivers audiences' expectations of seeing the fully formed Superman and Clark Kent.<br /><br />Amy Adam's Lois Lane is the exact embodiment of what we'd expect from an aggressive, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter.  She expresses hard-edged yet beautiful humanity when she stumbles onto the story of the century, only to realize she can't run it as it means ruining a man's life.  Michael Shannon brings to Zod a level of depth beyond just rage and vengeance.  A key revelation in his character is a tragic one.  We learn that he faces fulfilling a destiny he did not choose for himself.  As Clark's mother, Diane Lane balances showing concern and fear for her son as his powers emerge and he begins questioning why God made him this way.  Lane treats her Kryptonian adopted son as she would any child, hiding her fear and learning how to help her son control his powers.  Her goal is that of all mothers - teaching her son that childhood is just a phase of life, not its end.<br /><br />In the Superman saga, the most important parental figures have always been the fathers - Jor-El and Jonathan Kent.  It's the casting of Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent that illustrate to audiences who Clark is when we meet him, and how he becomes Superman by the end of the film.  In Snyder's MAN OF STEEL, it is done better than in any previous cinematic version of the character.<br /><br />Costner's Jonathan Kent is a complex man.  Upon learning young Clark has saved a school bus full of his classmates from sinking into a river, Costner is angered.  Insisting Clark must keep his powers a secret, when young Clark asks him if he should have let them die, Costner honestly responds, \\"Maybe.\\"  He is a father desperate to protect his son from a world he knows is not ready to accept him.  A world he fears will turn its mightiest weapons against his son to kill him.<br /><br />Yet, with each flashback featuring Costner's Jonathan Kent, the wisdom he departs deepens, as does the love he has for his son.  And Costner's Jonathan Kent imparts unto his son the ultimate example any father who truly believes in principles can - showing your son that you stand behind them at all cost. It's the film's most moving sequence.<br /><br />Russell Crowe's Jor-Elis equally full of dimension.  His role in the film is not limited to his scenes on Krypton.  When Kal-El finally discovers a way to download his father's `consciousness,' Crowe plays the scenes with kindness, reason and - above all - a powerful conviction of faith in his son.  Crowe is able to balance acknowledging the burden his son will face as he reveals Kal-El's Kryptonian origins to him, and the awesome responsibility Jor-El as a father is asking of Kal-El as a son to use his powers in becoming an inspiration and symbol of hope for the human race.  Like Costner's Jonathan Kent, Crowe inspires confidence in his son by reinforcing principles.<br /><br />There is a sense of consistency in the values of Jonathan Kent and Jor-El as played by Costner and Crowe - a bridged gap that seems almost cosmic.  As if the two fathers are at once separate, yet part of a whole.<br /><br />This is not a Superman for those clinging to the Fleischer animated shorts, the Reeves TV series, or the Richard Donner film.  And it doesn't need to be.  For those longing for those depictions of Superman, they will always exist - wonderfully preserved on Blu-Ray and DVD.  MAN OF STEEL does not negate these past incarnations, and it shouldn't.  Audiences should always treasure these previous versions of Superman.<br /><br />Yet, the vitriol and anger expressed by critics and some Superman fans against MAN OF STEEL mystifies.  The accusation that the last hour of the film is just an over-the-top, empty, bombastic, visual effects laden disaster movie?  Not true.  There's as much drama, character development and emotion to be found in these scenes as there is in the rest of the film.  Furthermore, the film's climax is a `toned down' version of many modern Superman PG-13 animated films, graphic novels and comic book sagas, including the classic 1993 \\"The Death of Superman\\" story.<br /><br />In 2007, the DC Animated Universe division released a direct-to-video film of this story entitled \\"Superman: Doomsday.\\"  Rated PG-13, it contained more killings, violence, brutal action sequences, destroyed cities and adult content than MAN OF STEEL - and its running time was only 75 minutes.  I can only imagine what critics and many Superman fans would be saying this weekend had Warner Bros. chosen to release that 5 year old animated film instead of MAN OF STEEL.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|Five years ago, back when I was getting into WoW raiding back in Burning Crusade, I was looking for a nice replacement for my old Logitech G15 keyboard, the original model that suffered from breaking LCD screens because of the hinged display. I had picked up the Belkin Nostromo, but after plugging it in I quickly became dissatisfied with the product. It didn't feel right, the D-pad didn't feel reliable, and it had too few buttons for what I needed. I promptly returned it and thought little of it until I found the Logitech G13.<br /><br />First off, it was a Logitech Product, which attracted my attention because while my G15 had died on me, it had given me a few good years of use, as had my Logitech MX1000, which lasted much longer. It had a similar shape to that of the Nostromo, but perhaps most notably had more buttons than the Nostromo. I picked it up, brought it home and went about trying it out.<br /><br />It had more than enough buttons to suit my needs, and the design for their layout was pretty great, particularly the concave design of the four center buttons which felt very natural unlike the Nostromo's more staggered design. I used it constantly, through Burning Crusade, Wrath, and even Cataclysm before I took a break from World of Warcraft. I never really used it for much beyond that, but then WoW was one of the few games I could play on my old computer, which was a used Mini-Mac.<br /><br />A little while passed, I moved onto a new computer and a few new games, particularly some other MMOs, but during that time I neglected my Logitech G13. I didn't treat it particularly well because I didn't think I'd ever need it again and I never really wanted to set it up for another game, which was not a problem with the software or the peripheral itself, just a disinterest of my own.<br /><br />A friend eventually convinced me to give WoW a try again with the Mists trial and I did. I enjoyed myself and pulled back out my Logitech G13. I spent a few minutes setting upthe software and my keybinds, but found it entirely as it used to be. The keys were just as responsive, the display works still perfectly, as does the backlighting for both, of particular note I'm delighted that the keys haven't worn off like the Razer Keyboard I had used for a while. It's been a few months since I started playing WoW again and the Logitech G13 is still great. And while my frequent use has broken off a slight chip on the small analog nub, it works without problem despite that one point.<br /><br />I have not been a great owner to my Logitech G13, perhaps even abusive. It has suffered being kicked around, spilled on, tangled cords, and a Mac Mini(the poor thing), but it remains strong. I love my Logitech G13, and could not recommend it more to any gamer, particularly MMO gamers.<br /><br />If I had any complaints about it there would be a few. One, is the analog nub, which while very agile and responsive, is a bit small and can take some getting used to, not only to maneuver, but also to press down on. Two, while it is very comfortable to use, the ergonomics are not great. Three, it's not as attractive as say a Razer Nostromo or Orbweaver. Three, in the five years that I've used it I've seen Logitech redesign many of their products, remove old and add new, but the Logitech G13 remains unchanged.<br /><br />While the G13 is great, it is not flawless, and could use a new version, maybe one without the LCD display that I have never personally used, a better analog nub, and a more ergonomic design. Were it not for Razer's unreliability compared to Logitech and the lacking number of keys I would most certainly retire my old G13 for something a little sleeker and more comfortable. It's not a complaint about the product itself, but as a fan of the original I would love to see a successor.<br /><br />All of that being said, if you're looking for a very reliable and fantastic game pad/command pad for your gaming needs, I would highly recommend the Logitech G13. It will take whatever abuse you dish out and return it by faithfully serving you for years with continuing high performance. It's worth every dollar and has earned every star.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|If you're looking up you can tell what stars you're looking at.  I just haven't ever used it. Some day I'll remember I have it and try it out.
0316098337|5.0|I read this book a long time ago, when it was Book of the Month on Amazon. I must have read close to a hundred books since then. But today it popped up as discounted in an email, and it prompted me to leave a review. This story is unforgettable. I normally don't read books twice, but I will be reading this one again. The fact the author was able to basically write the entire story in one setting (the room), and it came out with such depth is simply art. I cried and cheered for these two characters. This is a Must Read!
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|The subtile interplay of characters keeps me watching.  I like the characters and stories.  Here are my six required words.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This is a very good book. It deserves five stars for the well-written characters alone. The story had me on the edge of my seat, I had to read in one sitting.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This escape game was challenging. Not to easy and not to hard. Each level has the right degree of difficulty to keep you intrigued and entertained.  Can't wait for more.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|This movie boils down to love & visual effects.<br />You have your classic tale of two young lovers from different worlds who aren't supposed to be together.<br />Combine that with a futuristic setting & masterful visual effects along the lines of \\"Inception\\".<br />What do you get?? Upside Down.<br />I really enjoyed this movie.<br />I would rate it:<br />5 stars for visual effects. Stunning! That's all I can say.<br />5 stars for creativity, ingenuity & originality! This is one of a kind. I love movies that can step away from the norm & do it well.<br />4 stars for the acting, plot & love story in general. It's not the \\"Notebook\\", but I've definitely seen worse.<br />All-in-all...Definitely worth watching!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I brought this for my 16 month old twins. They absolutely love it! There were no HOLES, as some others have complained about. I would recommend this product to others. I give it 5 stars (had it for 2 wks now).

Imagine the disappointment when your new &#34;parents&#34; only wanted you as another field hand or housekeeper. This follows the stories of some of these orphans from the trains.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game for all ages and above. You'll find yourself competing with your Facebook friends' scores as well as mini games with the different powerups that you purchase. its just a fun way to play games.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game very much, remind me of Mario days. Graphics are great. Hope they add more stages soon.
0060245867|5.0|And it stuck with me for life. I use that phrase all the time and give the books out as gifts to children. Great moral and lots of fun to read!
B006N0YWGY|5.0|The race, the concept, I am simply amazed that for such a smsll game it not only works but can keep me entranced for hours.<br /><br />Pilot your swamp boat, grab bonus cash, play the economy, steer clear of slowing obstacles, and cash out as much as you can. Grand Theft Auto meets the Loisiana swamps, and lemonade stand, with a lil bit of cajun thrown in to spice things up.<br /><br />Missing features are versus and leaderboards. This is still a must have game for anyone who enjoys racing type games.
B00005JLIU|4.0|This movie, which stars Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, Beatrice Lillie, and Carol Channing, is a very entertaining spoof of The Roaring Twenties, with good songs (both newly written for the movie, including the title track, and period pieces, such as \\"Baby Face\\") and some really good dancing.  Although the white-slavery subplot slows down the film a bit, the movie is very entertaining overall.  This film was the basis for [[ASIN:B000066B4Y the 2002 Broadway Tony Award-winning musical of the same name; I own the original cast CD]].  While the new musical is much better, the original film is still enjoyable.  I used to own this film [[ASIN:B00004R79D on VHS]], and now I have the DVD, though there are few extras, except for the theatrical trailer, an advertisement, but no trailers, for three recommended DVDs: [[ASIN:B0000714BR The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]], [[ASIN:B00007J5VN Sweet Charity]], and [[ASIN:B0015FQZI0 Xanadu - Magical Musical Edition (With Complete Soundtrack CD)]], plus English and Spanish audio tracks, and English and French subtitles.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I choose this rating because it felt the game was to young for me. You should have a rating of not sure. I recommend this game for children.

B00992CF6W|4.0|We need more updates and ideas it is doing well but we need more  monsters  and more interesting things  like electricity  more diamonds and gold  and caves more animals
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Definitely one of the better escape games. It makes you think, but isn't ridiculously hard. Looking forward to more levels!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is definitely an asome game. It is is just like a real hourse. It is EPIC  X10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br />A must have
0920668372|5.0|Want to laugh and want to cry...love this book.  Author is our favorite.  Always give his books as gifts to our friends with new babies...can't go wrong, with a gift like this.  READING IS 'FUN'-DAMENTAL...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lot of fun and addictive wish it had hints some of the items are hard to figure out how to use. Its still a lot of fun trying to figure out where to use each item you find.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The movie kept stopping every couple of minutes to re-download. A real bummer. The movie itself, though was entertaining and liked.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Got a few minutes to 'kill'? Make good use of them and enrich your mind or at least entertain yourself.
0061950726|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  We have members of our reading group from three generations of our family.  This is the first selection for the group.  The book is easy enough for the younger members of the group and thomembers.  ught provoking enough for the more mature members.  Ages are from 14 to 75.  Several members of the group have personal acquaintenances with ancesters who were orphan train children.  Those personal stories added to the value of the story related in the book.
159463176X|5.0|If you enjoyed the first two books by Hosseini, you will love this one, The storylines weave together seamlessly and the characters slowly come to life as they enter your heart. I have raved about it so much that my friends are lined up to borrow it when I finish.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I was reluctant to say the least when I heard \\"Alice in Chains\\" had a new singer and a new couple albums.  I had an enormous emotional wall up because of the band's previous singer's passing.  Layne was amazing, and I don't hold it against the band at all that they move on.<br /><br />As for this album, it is hard to express how I feel about it, except for sure to say that I think it's amazing in more ways than one.  For starters, this is an \\"Alice in Chains\\" album.  The new singer's similarity to Layne is so incredibly similar and yet authentic.  I hear the band there.  I feel guilty about it, but I love it.  It has some kind of novel yet ghostly appeal.<br /><br />The sonic style I'm familiar with is so here on this album.  I'm glad Jerry Cantrell stuck with it.  I just ordered the previous album.  The truth is that like many, I had my heart broken when Layne passed away.  I was much younger and it took me a decent amount of time to try out this music.<br /><br />It was totally worth it though.  You just have to buy it and listen.  I hear the band there.<br /><br />This was a solid purchase for me.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Everything the trilogy is and should be on that beautiful Blu-Ray quality!<br /><br />Shopped around and got this set on Amazon for less than any store was offering it for.<br />Comes with a cool behind the scenes photo book too!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a quick easy read and extremely entertaining. I can't wait to see what happens next! But first...back to the \\"a song of ice and fire series\\"
B000FCKGPC|4.0|But how could it not be? After killing off the majority of the characters in book three, of course book four will be a challenge as the author has to get us into the heads of those left --and most of those are folks I didn't really like in the first books.  That being said,once I got over the fact that this book was more focused on Kings Landing and didn't Dr with the wall or Bran, I enjoyed it greatly
B009KEN87O|5.0|Wasn't expecting much when I first downloaded, but was pleasantly surprised- the game has an old-school pixelated vibe (in a good way) but has quirky, unique modern twists (such as 3-d &quot;invincible mode&quot;). Easy to pick up, hard to put down!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|All in all this was a good book. But I did not like the end. I feel like someone has to die in Nicholas Sparks books.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Last month, a South African friend of mine turned me on to this guy, telling me he was huge in South Africa in the 70s; saying he was better than Dylan (and just about the biggest thing in his native S Africa at the time).  Like just about everyone else, I had never heard of Rodriguez until now.  And like most everyone else, I am singularly impressed with Cold Fact (and also with Coming From Reality).  Not a bad song on either album - it's amazing to me that these albums were ignored upon release in the US.<br /><br />I am just listening to Cold Fact for the first few times, so I don't have a track-by-track analysis.  But, as mentioned, so far I find that the entire album to be great.  I'd say \\"Sugar Man\\", \\"Crucify Your Mind\\", \\"This is not a Song\\", \\"Hate Street Dialogue\\", \\"Inner City Blues\\", \\"I Wonder\\", and \\"Rich Folks Hoax\\" immediately stand out from the rest, but only slightly since the whole album is of high quality.<br /><br />Rodriguez is a top poet & storyteller.  Definitely recommended.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games (Book 1)<br />great book, this is one of the recommended books from my Eng teacher. The contend is not too scary as my friends told me.
1616550414|5.0|Even after playing all the games up until Skyward this had a lot of nice info in it...The time line was nice to see in printed material.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Jerry has continued the legacy of AIC in nothing less than the best possible way since Layne left this world.<br /><br />AIC will be always be on the greatest of the grunge era.<br />AIC should be RR HOF inductees as soon as they are eligible. Who knows tho, took those idiots forever to induct RUSH....
B001ILFUDC|5.0|They sure don't make em like they used to! I recently had a fit of nastolgia and purchased a bunch of classic Diseny movies to watch with my then 5  year old. Its amazing how I forgot the lessons I learned from these movies and how they teach us to overcome obstacles. I thought my son would be bored to pieces but we loved watching. I miss Mr. Cricket.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly enjoy playing this. Its fun and its the type of game that makes you want to best your best score
0345803507|5.0|Christan Gray need I say more. I enjoyed the triology and this was a good ending. Kind of the adult version of twilight with sex.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|Full of action must have! My whole family enjoyed this movie The item came in perfect condition thank you very much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very fun and challenging set of puzzles that are difficult to solve (for some at least) and yet not quite so hard as to be overly frustrating to figure out.
B002APU580|5.0|I thought that this movie was very well done. i realize that there other versions out there, but with the talent used and the quality of that talent, it was done perfectly for the period and theme used. Keira is one of my favorites so i have no problem with her ability to work this role. It was her that led me to buy this movie, and am glad i did. my opinion is not the final say so by any means, i just know what i like. everything was done in good taste, and the scenic effects went right along with the movie. very moving, and entertaining.
B000FCK65W|4.0|I really liked reading about Francie's neighborhood and all the variety of people she observed.  It reminded me of when I was a young girl watching people from my front porch.  I lived on a street with a church at one end of the block and a saloon or bar at the other end.  Therefore there were a variety of people in various states of stress, intoxication or excitement and I could relate to Francie's description of what she saw and heard from her perch on the fire escape or window.<br /><br />Francie describes the family unit and their difficulties to survive and strive to make a better life for themselves.  Reading about Francie's life is very different from current day living.  The current generation may find her descriptions hard to believe or even visualize, especially when she's talking about pennies to purchase items.  The technology we have today was non-existent then.  Many in our current generation wouldn't even know how to survive the way Francie and her family lived.<br /><br />A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is good to read for comparisons and maybe to make us observe things around us a little more and realize just how good we have it.  It is life in reality about relationships, romantic attractions, childbirth without medications, hard work, disappointments, scraping money together to survive, favoratism, alcoholism, responsibility, short lifespans, and how education can lead to a better life.  This would not be a book for young people not ready to hear about some of these realities.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It is a really good book.<br />I liked every part of the book.<br />I would recommend this book to kids or adults that likes Greek mythology.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun.  each level is more challenging.  engaging . it keeps you busy and on your toes,  clicking,  thinking &amp; trying to figure out where the puzzles &amp; what the answers are.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some of the &quot;clues&quot; don't make sense so takes a bit longer to figure out but kept my interest and will keep playing.
0767836324|3.0|Not Too bad, Thou not as good as I remembered but still a pretty good family classic from my childhood!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Jeffrey Archer had his ups and downs, but anyone who reads the Clifton Chronicles can be in no doubt about its classification. This is the Jeffrey Archer as we've always known him. Excellent build-up, full of historical details that makes the plot all the more fascinating. You just can't put it down. Masterly.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Good buy. I listened to the music from the movies and knew I wanted to buy the sound track. Cohen brothers have good taste in music.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|The Clifton Chronicles are well written and highly entertaining. Archer still is a storyteller in a class of his own. Don't miss this one!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids love this game. Always asking me if they can use the tablet to take care of their horse. Must have for kids
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I am very happy with this battery app.  It provides detailed information to help you manage battery life.  I highly recommend this battery app.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a parent I can understand the narrator's position.  It took me a while to get through it, but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />It's definitely worth the read and once you're finished, I'm certain you'll have so many questions swirling around in your head.  The question is to what lengths what would you go to protect your child.
0345803485|5.0|I actually read book three first, now I'm reading book one and it has a connection, I love the books. I can't wait to get book two!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I like the script and the film and I can watch it over and over. The performance, especially Angelina Jolie is, as always the best. It could be considered an action, but without so many artificial, digital effects film, that makes it more real.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Although the first part of the book was a little slow, the premise and characters were great and I couldn't wait to read the next one.
B005OK721G|5.0|I like the script and the film and I watch it over and over. The performance of Zoe Saldana is excellent, and I can't imagine anyone else in this role anymore. The script is close to the reality and it makes it more real. You miss too much if you haven't seen it yet.<br />It is must-see film.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|If you're a fan of sociology and cultural phenomena or just a curious person this is an excellent book. Gladwell has a jovial and knowledgeable way of explaining just about anything.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|can't wait to see what they come up with next.  I would like to see the same people in it but who knows
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Excellent buy, very good product and good quality, love it, recommend it, and I give five stars for all that I mentioned before.
B004UFEJVW|2.0|Initial themes of death, aging, loss of a spouse & inability to have children may be distressing for some adults for whom any of these touches a raw spot.<br /><br />If none of those apply or are recent, go for it! The fertility/loss of a newborn (ambiguous in movie) theme is likely to go over younger kids' heads. The visuals are fun as is typical for this studio, though as an adult there are other cartoons I would prefer to this one.<br /><br />Many may disagree, but for our household this was the wrong movie at the wrong time.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|i like the movie alot of action too watch.it was a little hard too figure out when fighting who was good or bad. but it still was a good movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Please make more soon.  I want more.I'm addicted. I don't know how much more I can wait. How much longer
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album absolutely, positively rocks. It is as nostalgic as being there the day Black Sabbath debuted: heavy, dark, mysterious, intense and insanely Ozzy. Even his voice stands the test of time, no matter how much engineering may have gone into that. I can actually understand every word! Shocking! I do, however, have two minor problems with the album. First, \\"End of the Beginning\\" is great, but far too long, including Iommi's solo. It it were something more memorable, say in the vein of Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" then fine. But it's not. His work is similar to that of Kirk Hammett of Metallica. Both produce memorable hooks and chord transitions, but not particularly memorable lead versing. This aside [because no musician is perfect] I actually went down to Barnes and Noble and bought the CD because the album is so damn good. Every single song. Like the old days. Metallic should study this album carefully because it has their classic - and wildly popular - \\"Black Album\\" written all over it...and then some.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another great book by kate Morton.  I know you will enjoy this book if you like her other books.  I will keep the secret a secret from you as you can find out the unexpected just like I did.
0765334798|4.0|A clever idea may be carried a bit too far, but Scalzi's underlying fondness for people, their loves, and their foibles redeems it.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I was intrigued by the first book because it was so different than anything else I had read. I couldn't finish this book because I am so bored with the concept now. If you are into the erotica genre, then this book is for you. Too much sex, not enough of the story line. The book is filled with so many sex scenes; trying to skim past them becomes a chore.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|From start to finish, this movie grabbed me and didn't let go. What a great story, exceptional acting and beautifully shot. True grit, not a happy-feely kinda movie. Not a typical Hollywood feel good, all wrapped up in a bow at the end kinda movie. Sweat, blood and pain pours thru the screen and into your heart. This is a MUST see film.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy playing it a lot, but there are some thing needed adjustment . The game will just stop and I have to start over again. But I like playing the game.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Yeah, it's not saying much, but the app is very good, has a ton of time-related gizmos outside of the alarm itself and it's freaking free. It's a must have, whether you need a new alarm clock, travel or want to increase the Kindle Fire's functionality.

B00C5W3SBE|2.0|How pathetic is it when a CGI China Doll turns in a more engaging performance than any of the human actors? While I won't go so far as to say I hated this movie, I sure didn't like it much.<br /><br />Whoever thought it would be a good idea to have James Franco anchor this film should be made to go back to casting 101. He was neither great nor powerful as the womanizing con man or the reformed Wizard.  Oz the vapid and inept was more like it. He had two basic facial expressions, grinning like a crazed monkey and constipated. He alternated between over-acting and just phoning it in but I never got the feeling that he was ever actually in character. I've seen grade school plays with better performances.<br /><br />The three witches were not mucn better and the worst if them was Mila Kunis' Theodora.  Kunis does petulant and spiteful really well (i.e. Jackie in That 70's show) but \\"magnificently evil\\" is way beyond her skill set.  And when she morphs into the Wicked Witch of the West the green make up actually emphasizes her chipmunk cheeks and instead of looking like she would eat kittens and small children - as a proper wicked witch should - she looked like a 7th grader in a Halloween costume! I kept looking for her plastic pumpkin to see if she had collected any candy. The great Margaret Hamilton, who WAS magnificently evil as Miss Gulch/WWW, must have been spinning in her grave.<br /><br />The movie was too long, too boring, and while I was glad I rented it on PPV instead of paying to see it in the theater, it was definitely not worth the 5 bucks I spent on it.  Unfortunately, it apparently made enough money that they will probably film a sequel.

B000GWE44U|2.0|I was a little young to watch The Shining when it was originally released.  Since the movie, Room 237, was released recently, there has been a little more \\"buzz\\" about this film.  I decided to read the book, then watch the movie.  The movie was a big disappointment for me.  I realize that movie effects have come a long way from what was available in 1980, but in the book, the hotel itself seemed \\"alive\\" and almost like another character.  In the movie, the hotel was just haunted by some weird characters and you weren't sure if they meant any harm or if they were just incidental.  The movie didn't explore the history of the hotel and didn't even really hint about the tragedies that happened long before the Torrances arrived.  It would have been scarier/darker if there had been more foreshadowing of the paranormal events.<br /><br />There was also no explanation of why the Torrances didn't just leave.  In the book, you had a good idea that this was Jack's last chance at keeping a steady income while working on his play.  He really needed the job to provide for his family after being fired from teaching.  There was so much that could have been covered using flashbacks, but it was ignored entirely to the detriment of the story, in my opinion.<br /><br />I think Jack Nicholson was a great choice for the lead character.  He portrayed a seemingly stable person who could snap at any given moment.  Shelly Duvall was OK, but more importantly, I don't think she was given a role that worked well in the movie.  The little boy was pretty amazing, but I thought the idea of him talking to his index finger in a deep voice was laughable.  In the book, his pretend friend, Tony, was a shadowy figure, only visible to Danny, and gave him information.  Tony could have been portrayed as a shadow (as opposed to Danny's index finger...), that leaves the room when someone else besides Danny comes in.  It could be a shadow that you may see out of the corner of your eye, not knowing whether your eye is playing tricks or not.  Though Tony was not, ultimately, a scary figure in the book, you weren't sure if you should trust him.  The appearance of Tony was always a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />I think this movie could be re-made by someone with a deeper understanding of the book and characters.  I never felt an attachment to the characters in the movie.  Special effects have also come a long way...

B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Two people, who don't quite fit in with those around them, make an instant connection with each other with just a look. They find themselves separated in a place between life and death. As they travel through the different worlds of the various Cirque du Soleil shows, they are helped, tempted, or hindered by those they meet.<br /><br />You don't have to love Cirque du Soleil or even have seen any of its shows to enjoy this movie. All you need is the ability to appreciate the talents of the performers, the musicians, and everyone who worked behind the scenes to bring an up-close view of what Cirque du Soleil represents.  I have to admit that the first time I saw this in the theater, I didn't understand why there were so many scenes in slow motion.  Now I understand the genius behind those sequences as every time I watch this movie, I see something new and can marvel at the performers' form or the choreography involved to transition between one movement to the next.  I am so grateful for everyone involved in the creation of this movie as it inspires me with its display of how awesome and unique people can be, both on- and off-screen.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Definitely worth the money, It will get updates for more guns and is something to mess with when your bored.

I keep getting kicked out of the film at the end of random chapters and sent back to the main menu, which is more than slightly annoying.

I get much more from watching the series after having read the books!  The character development and detail are so rich, and the unexpected turns and twists keep me turning page after page to see what's next.  Love them!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My daughter has been playing this with her BFF as they are on vacation together and sent me an email asking if she could buy it with her own money.

0385366752|3.0|There are plenty of reviews about Gone Girl, which I found generally very intriguing but with a flat, unbelievable and disappointing ending that left me thinking \\"What?\\".  So I'll just comment on the production of the audio version.  I found that the actress reading the role of Amy was exceptional.  Her voice was perfect for the character and very nuanced as Amy's character continued to be revealed.  Loved the job she did.  The actor who portrayed Nick was not bad or distracting but I just didn't really see him as Nick.  Maybe it was just the way his character was slowly developed over the first part of the book but I just never warmed to him at all.  Overall, a nice production.  The primary complaint I have is that each disc did not come to a logical endpoint, e.g., some discs ended mid-sentence!  The next disc started with the rest of the dialogue.  I found that very awkward.  I really prefer that audiobook discs stop at the end of a thought or even chapter, when possible.  Similarly, the next disc should repeat the last sentence of the prior disc to ensure a feeling of continuity.  This one did not.  However, if you like audio books, there is no substantive reason not to get the CD version of Gone Girl.  It moves quickly and has excellent sound quality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Perfect combination of challenging and fun but not so difficult that you get frustrated either.  Can't wait for more levels to be released!

B002PMPTIO|5.0|It could never be easy to rebot Star Trek.  It has such a large and developed mythology.  However, that same mythology can be stultifying and hinder some very creative stories.  Hence, a reboot.  One which stays true to who the characters and the foundational worlds ultimately are, and yet changes them enough for us to appreciate where they will eventually go.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I was sorta forced to see this as what little I knew about it didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />But I also thought that about 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' too and boy was I wrong about that one!<br /><br />This was a very good movie. I understand about some possible problems with the movie and certain scenes.<br /><br />I, personally, no longer have young children (my daughters in college now) but I think I would view this situtation as a 'teaching moment'. However, this is a not a movie for very young children or any that are very sensitive.<br /><br />But this is a very fun movie otherwise. It is very well written. The voices are 'spot-on' and fit the characters perfectly. I also thought they depicated the change of heart of the main character (Gru) very well. I'm not going to go into the story other then to say it's very good and that most people will enjoy it greatly. It's funny and has heart as well.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies that I'm actually looking forward to see the sequel which opens on 7/4/13 which is next week.<br /><br />I would give this a 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow!  What can I say.  This was a fun, fun book.  I was both elated and somewhat embarrassed that I picked up on EVERY single one of his 80's pop-cultural references, even the esoteric sci-fi/fantasy ones.  I didn't always get the anime ones though.  But the book isn't simply a litany of ain't-it-cool references.  It also has characters who grow, are challenged, and become better people in the end.  I would want to take away a half-star for one area: his future world's economy and military makes absolutely no sense at all.  In his future world, most everyone is impoverished.  Cities are graveyards.  In such a situation, large corporations won't be making huge profits.  After all, who are their customers?  No one should be able to afford their products.  And without significant cash flow for R&D, there won't be innovation, especially because the education system in Mr. Cline's future world doesn't exactly produce world-class engineers.

B0090SI4OC|5.0|Tuesday 9th April 2013<br /><br />The Host<br /><br />From the book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer. Time of show, 1305hrs, Cost of Tickets $6:00 each.<br /><br />Cinema AMC Colonial 18<br /><br />825 Lawrenceville-suwanee Rd<br />Lawrenceville, GA 30043<br /><br />After all the hullaballoo surrounding the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer, of course I had a little look at the books at the library. I'm only marginally interested in what has become Young Adult writing, and I've never had any interest in Vampires whatsoever. They weren't my thing at all.<br /><br />I wasn't much interested when the book, \\"The Host,\\" came along, but the original cover was so creative and was such a beautiful haunting image, well, I bought the book.<br /><br />So sue me. I had no idea it would become my favourite book ever. Even eclipsing the riotous, \\"Fat Ollie's Book,\\" by Ed McBain.<br /><br />They HAD to make a film out of it. For some time, despite the clamour of the fans, not much happened until Saoirse Ronan signed on in about 2010. It meandered about in development hell until we were finally informed it was coming out in 2013.<br /><br />It is fair to say that the critical acclaim has been missing. At Rotten Tomatoes the procrits give it 11%, while the audience gives it closer to 60%. Both are ridiculous low numbers, and would be for films which are utter crap. There's something else going on here, as if someone doesn't like Meyer's view of the world, or what, I don't know. The critics are unreasonably harsh, when they were gaga over the complete tripe that was, \\"The Avengers.\\"<br /><br />Do we not seek drama with tragedy and a happy ending any more? Do we just want explosions and gals dressed in leather? Big, hairy men dressed in spanx?<br /><br />Maybe that is what we want. Shoot, weez in trubble.<br /><br />The Host's essence is love, or perhaps the power of love. I have opined many times that it has parallels to the story of Jesus of Nazareth. That view has been universally mocked. Which makes me think I am an alien or as mad as a box of frogs. The similarities in the stories, the sacrifice, the re-incarnation, the trans-substantiation of a spirit/soul into another body?<br /><br />Seems clear to me. Hah, wouldn't be the first time I've disagreed with the entire world.<br /><br />The action takes place in some Western Desert location, later revealed to be New Mexico. I liked the peculiar white look of the scene making and the simple construction of the shops and their contents. Susan, my spouse stated that perhaps there could have been more introductory exposition as to why the Aliens/Souls came to Earth and took it over. On that point, there wasn't much exposition in the book, so if Director Niccol added it, I would have found it outside his aegis. Which is to tell the story in the book, even if he must truncate that, as film must.<br /><br />Wanda's wander into the desert is much shaved from the book, which is a good thing. The spectacular car crash was a bit daft. Safe Volvo's might be, but surviving a roll-over at that speed would be beyond any human I know of. Dis is da movies, don't try that at home.<br /><br />William Hurt out-Jebbed Uncle Jeb. He was perfect in a role which could have been cloying, but it was deftly done. Excellent work by a fine actor. Susan thought Hurt was Jeff Daniels. (She identifies anything in a beard and above 40 as Jeff Daniels.)<br /><br />The young men, were handsome young men. Very tall logs of wood. Not required to do much acting, as is the modern way, and they had spent much time in the gym getting ready for their roles.<br /><br />Diane Kruger was excellent as The Seeker. Not quite the creature of the book, but compelling and vulnerable at the same time. Long and lean, the camera enjoyed looking at her and her impossibly long, graceful legs.<br /><br />To be fair, so did I:)<br /><br />There's been a lot of rabbiting about how the double indentity of Wanda/Melanie was to be handled. Some people have been critical, but here's the thing, if you can't tone down your skepticism for a movie about Aliens coming and taking us over, when is it that you do? You must suspend disbelief, or no movies makes sense at all. Movies are about magic, and this was magic.<br /><br />I found the voices off, with a different tone and accent to delineate the two characters convincing. Saoirse Ronan's facial expressions during this difficult technique just right. It was a fascinating challenge for the film maker and the actor, and they pulled it off. I have always said that I would have chosen Summer Glau for this role. Glau is perhaps too subtle, very technical and has an ethereal nature that would have given the role a different feel, for me.<br /><br />Ronan was chosen and that's it, she did a great job. Whaddoino? I'm no director.<br /><br />There is a scene in the book, in, \\"The Docs,\\" room. Wanda stumbles on humans attempting to extract souls from taken over human bodies. This process kills both parties. It is a pivotal and tragic scene. The filming and drama of this scene and those that follow, with the representations of the souls/aliens was very convincingly done and beautiful, if tragic. It reflects the question Capt Adama asks at the beginning of Battlestar Galactica. \\"What we did, what we do, there has to be a purpose, what is it and is it worth it?\\"<br /><br />At the end of the movie, I asked a few people close by what they thought of it. Most gave it 8/10. Maybe they were reacting to the rather strange man with the odd accent who isn't from rahnd heah. I choose to hope they were being honest.<br /><br />I said right from the start that I would be happy if Niccol and his band of players took the project seriously and addressed its themes with care. They did that, in spades. In my opinion, it made a super movie. The haunting themes of vulnerability, love and the power of that love to supersede everything came through loud and clear.<br /><br />I loved it. Ignore the critics and go and see it. 9/10<br /><br />brendanle have been critical, but here's the thing, if you can't tone down your skepticism for a movie about Aliens coming and taking us over, when is it that you do?

B00C5XBAOA|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that the castle shipped to us first (didn't buy from amazon), and the castle was so terrible, that perhaps these shine in comparison! I was originally going to rate this a 3 because I think they are just OK but my daughter loves to play with them so much that I had to bump it up an extra star for her. However, I should warn you that I could draw a picture of Sofia on a piece of cardboard and she would be just so happy to play with that b/c she loves Sofia so much! Here's why this toy is terrible:<br /><br />1. As everyone has said--the heads pop off so often that its almost as though this was supposed to be The French Revolution Play Set. Especially Amber--for some reason whenever you try to make her sit down--off comes her head. The King is the only figure that does not lose his head because it cannot manuever like the others. In theory, it was pretty brilliant that they tried to make these toys able to sit, turn their heads, and work with a talking base but somewhere along the line they forgot that the target audience was primarily small children... Honestly, the trade off of the hourly \\"oh no! what happened!\\" as your child hands you her doll minus the head was not worth the extra articulation. Makes you look at the much less attractive fisher price little people dolls with the appreciation they deserved all along!<br /><br />2. The figures won't always talk in the voices that they are supposed to. I'd say about every 20 phrases or so the base gets it wrong--a non-Sofia character activates a Sofia phrase. I'm less concerned over this because for our set it at least goes back to working again. That doesn't seem to be the case for everyone..<br /><br />3. Some of the softer plastic will chip--some of Sofia's hair has managed to chip off--I am not quite sure how it happened and was surprised that it was even possible--I've seen paint chip but never the actual plastic.<br /><br />4. As others have mentioned, getting the dolls to sit and stand is frustrating. The queen is perhaps the one figure that stands upright easily but she doesn't sit. The King does not sit either--but good luck getting him to stand upright. Sofia, Amber and James suffer from variations of these same issues. The figures are just awkward.. The dresses of amber and sofia have a soft plastic overlay to hide the hinge which is an interesting detail but I should take bets as to how long it will stay on.<br /><br />On the bright side... The heads pop back on easily. So far, none have broken irreparably. That's actually kind of sad that the pro's consist of \\"you can put the heads back on,\\" maybe I should deduct a star after all...<br /><br />Bottom line: This toy is awkward and fragile but my child doesn't seem to mind as it is played with everyday so I think I am much more disappointed than she is. I think a 14.99 price point would have been more reasonable but Mattel has inflated the price on this whole series. The disney store makes a more durable Sofia play set if you can catch one in stock. If you can't though, get ready for headless doll duty.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|When I watched both discs I was pleased to see that all of the former Eagles were interviewed and seemed to be able to be honest about their time with the band. My opinion is that the band isn't really as good since Henley and Frey fired Don Felder who seemed to have a great working relationship with Joe Walsh. The difference is really obvious in the Farewell DVD. This history contains some really good footage of the early Eagles that I hadn't seen before and I have quite a few DVDs of the early performances. I recommend it.

1856697061|5.0|I just received mine yesterday and I have to say this book is perfect, I ordered all three, two have arrived and I'm waiting on the third next week. What I love most about this book is the detailed technical explanation of how to developer the patterns. As an architect I really appreciate the construction drawings. Though for people who are not conversant with technical drawing it may serve as a challenge but even then it's pretty basic and straight forward. I love these books and I am going to post this same review on the other two. I'm very happy with this purchase. Let me add here that I'm happy with amazon that I can get these books, I live in Nigeria, so acquiring books like these locally is not easy

0375842209|1.0|The only thing that I find the least bit interesting about this book, is that it was ever published. Someone actually edited this thing? What it needs is some little pictures, so that the people that like it, can color them with crayons as they read. How can you care about the story, when it's presented in the form of endless, and insufferable blathering? But you have to love the irony, in that, this is the first book that I've ever wanted to burn.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series but very disappointed with the ending....I waiting to see what happens next with all the characters.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's really well drawn, looks very good,<br />but it's like a tamagochi,<br />you need to pet and feed the horse, and learn it tricks. if you do, you can grow and learn it more stuff.<br />It's probably one of the best drawn free games on an android platform<br /><br />But it's really nothing for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good times playing this game. Not as obscure as others like it. It's free which is awesome b/c I've played other games like this where they try to gouge you for hint money.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game. All the free games want you to buy something. Good instructions to go along with this one. Like it.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Upon finishing this book the first feeling that I had was elation that I had actually finished it. Infinite Jest is an extraordinary book, but it is difficult and you do have to want it.<br /><br />Catch-22 and Brave New World seem to have influenced Wallace in writing this book. There are tons of characters and the point of view changes at the drop of a hat. This is not a book to be read casually. I read every night before I go to bed but this book requires both concentration and dedication, do not try to read this after you've had a few drinks, you'll probably get lost and crash somewhere in the desert. (If you're lucky you'll get to talk to a cross-dressing spy.)<br /><br />There are points where Wallace gets a little Ayn Rand-ish. He goes off on long tangents (usually about tennis) that don't hold a lot of substance for the story, but I think that if you focus on it, it's easy enough to comprehend and there were only a few times I found myself bored.<br /><br />Despite all of my dread warnings, I really did enjoy this book. It delves into the meaning of entertainment, addiction, and possibly where the two intersect. This is a fantastic book, but it's not for everyone. Most of the story takes place between an elite private tennis academy and a halfway house that share the same name in 'near-future' Boston. Part of what makes this book difficult are copious undefined acronyms - intentionally undefined acronyms, most of them are resolved by the latter third of the book, but trying to work out what exactly they mean both engages the reader and is kind of fun.<br /><br />Published in 1998, Wallace managed to predict the rise of the internet in the life of a modern American, the War on Terror, and the continuation of vapid consumerism in our culture. It is incredibly relevant today.<br /><br /> \\"In a 2008 retrospective by The New York Times, Infinite Jest was described as \\"a masterpiece that's also a monster -- nearly 1,100 pages of mind-blowing inventiveness and disarming sweetness. Its size and complexity make it forbidding and esoteric.\\"<br /><br />This book made me fall in love with David Foster Wallace, but after reading it you have to decompress. I'm (slowly) making my way through Consider the Lobster which is a collection of his essays. If you're unsure whether or not this book is for you try a few of his essays to see if you enjoy his writing style or not.rming sweetness.

B0086700CM|5.0|Lots of fun, which for a few more instructions.<br />all the free games want you to buy something every so often
B009NY43NY|2.0|The writing in this is oh-so-bad. Worse than usual. I'm so glad that she decided to wrap the series up, and while the romantic conclusion for Sookie is satisfying, it's not enough to salvage the book.<br /><br />It's like Harris threw it all together, really quickly, before HBO could announce the last season of 'True Blood'.<br /><br />Probably worth a read for those that have followed the book. At least it's relatively short and hopefully true to the title.
0739352687|5.0|Even better than I expected, Rick Riordan has a great gift, and look forward to reading more books by him in the future.

1455803197|5.0|Rick Riordan in the start of this series proves that he can make any mythology more interesting, whether it's Roman, Greek, or Egyptian.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is an amazing new concept for this genre of games, combining what could easily be two different titles then adding on to this with yet another incredibly creative 'kid's with their fantasy creatures.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|A quick read.  Good for air travel and getting through an evening when one is too tired to think. Interesting quick study on characters with conflicting values.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I have read every Sophie kinsella book and I love all of them ! They are funny and witty and a real pleasure to read. Light hearted and full of surprises.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I bought this because I was afraid my kindle was going to get scratched during transport and for the fact that it props it up nicely on your lap when you are reading and surfing the net.  I love the case and would recommend it.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Great game really liked it Perfect for those that love object games. The graphics make it so much interesting and the whole plot just doesn't let you put the game away
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I have a built in bluetooth kit in my own car, but my Mom and wife don't so I thought I'd try this. I'd bought two blueant kits previously for them and they didn't pair well and were difficult to operate. But this one reviewed well so I thought I'd try again. My Mom has started using it (My wife has not gotten around to it yet) and raves about it all the time. She said it was extremely easy to use and pair off with her phone, she hears very well through the speaker, and says that people on the other end can't even tell she's on a speakerphone. Also she loves the fact that the magnet at the back makes it so easy to remove. The only criticism I would have is that they should provide an ac adapter for it to charge at home, and that the cord should be a little longer, but I knew all of that when I bought it so I don't think it's fair to deduct a star for that (maybe half a star. Amazon?)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and it is addictive. Even my 2 year old nephew likes to play this game. Great game for the entire family.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its fun so far its confusing and stuff is exspensive but caring for the horse is all that matters my horse is gonna be a champion to Me the game is fun and I hope you thinking so to
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Ehhh...it was ok.  The story was cute, but it's pretty easy to tell that pretty much the whole movie is done on green screen.  I'd say it was more of a kids movie than anything else.
B0012NO316|5.0|\\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" is an astonishing, exhausting film that must have raised quite a few eyebrows in 1966 for the language and subject matter. I must confess that I knew virtually nothing about this movie, and when some friends of mine said I absolutely HAD to watch it, I put it at the top of my queue, though I had no idea what to expect. No, Elizabeth Taylor does NOT play novelist Virginia Woolf. Instead, she and Richard Burton play the most dysfuntional, most co-dependent couple in the world who invite another couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over for a nightcap after a party. And WE, the viewers, are forced to participate in the increasingly nasty proceedings in a vicarious sort of way. I have to really hand it to Liz for her performance. Known heretofore for very glamorous roles, here she is completely over the top as the quintessential haridan. This is the movie most responsible for instigating the MPAA rating system, because audiences up to then were simply not accustomed to such frank language in a film.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I am a fan of LinkedIn and finally got a SmartPhone.  This was one of the first apps that I downloaded.  Use it all the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best game that has ever been created! It's very descriptive and creative it truly feels like it caring for your own horse:)
1451675046|3.0|I bought a hardbound version and loved it (well written and approachable). Last week, I gave this paperback version as a gift and was disappointed to hear that the paperback lacks the beautiful color illustrations that brought the original to life. Apparently the paperback version has a few b&w sketches, but that's it. I will now order a used hardback to send as a follow-up gift.
B0000024YL|5.0|Anyone who remembers these guy's will truely enjoy this CD. It is truely their greatest hits. Just listening to this took me back to the good times when they were popular.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|It's a pleasure to see the fine cast of veteran English actors work together. The scenery is evocative. The story is a little thin.
B0001US62I|5.0|Interested in watching this movie? The less you know about it, the better. DO NOT read any reviews. DO NOT ask your friends what it's about. And when you finally allow yourself to be immersed in the steamy charms of this striking psychological & supernatural thriller, don't ask too many questions; just be content to be swept up in the mystery. The payoff is worth it, trust me.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|The graphics are great. I play it on a kindle Fire HD 8'9 with no problems.  What is bad about this app is that it runs too fast.  You have no speed control . You end up crashing into every thing and can't accomplish anything. I think that the developers created this app for their own enjoyment. They think that since they have no trouble playing the app why would anyone else. They don't consider or seem to know that buyers of apps are different from them with different abilities and capabilities.  If they want to have really popular and high selling games then they have to consider the needs of buyers.  This is a good game if you have the reflexes of a 13 yr old. I'm glad that the app was free so no money of mine was wasted.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really awesome , but it's so addicting. I can barely put it down to do what I need to do during the day.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|Just when you think every great vintage show has been uncovered, along comes the Holy Grail of Supertramp-dom! Having seen the band several times (pre \\"Breakfast\\"), I knew they were an incredible live act, but quality video footage has been a rarity (or perhaps non-entity: there's the broadcast of the \\"last concert with Roger Hodgson\\" that's been floating around for years, but the sound and picture are nothing to write home about). The \\"Live in Paris\\" album has been a favorite of mine for years - a great live rendering of the band just at the cusp of superstardom. However, I had no idea the show had been filmed. And instead of this being released in some shoddy manner, the producers have remastered the film and soundtrack, providing a simply classic piece of concert memorabilia of a great band at the top of their game. The sound (in particular the 5.1 DTS) is stunning for a show now 34 years old - and the picture quality is equally as pristine. It wasn't long before Roger would become disillusioned with the direction of Supertramp and quit the proceedings, and what followed the mega \\"Breakfast in America\\" album after this tour was a series of forgettable records and the entire break-up of the band. That all makes this an even better find. While it's unfortunate that five of the songs from the Paris concert were never filmed, \\"Fool's Overture\\" and \\"Child of Vision\\" (not to mention nearly the entire \\"Crime of the Century\\" album) are worth the price of admission alone!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am very pleased that the clues and solutions do not seem to be repeating themselves from room to room. The graphics are excellent too.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I'm not sure if it's the time period it's set in or the way the author treats the subject here, but this is really an amazing book.  Must read!
B00009W0U4|5.0|Last week I watched Gaspar Noe's first film, \\"I Stand Alone.\\" This week I watched \\"Irreversible.\\" And all I can say is WOW. After seeing \\"I Stand Alone,\\" I suspected that Noe was a truly audacious, uncompromising talent worth watching and \\"Irreversible\\" has surely confirmed this for me. As you may have heard by now, the film is constructed as a series of short episode that are arranged in reverse order that is, we begin with revenge (bloody, visceral, BRUTAL revenge) and work backwards from there. Some might say that this is nothing more than a pretentious gimmick on Noe's part, but given what we gradually learn from the story, it works really well. The notorious rape scene occurs almost exactly at the midpoint of the film, and YES, it is also as brutal as you have been led to believe, but this is not to say it is gratuitious, just very real. Between the non-linear presentation, the swirling camerawork and sound design, \\"Irreversible\\" has an almost hallucinatory quality right to the very end. Gaspar Noe is a rare talent with a unique cinematic vision, not unlike the Stanley Kubrick he reportedly reveres so much. I'm going to be paying attention to this man's career.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|QUITE A LOVELY FILM.  FUNNY, TOUCHING, AND ROMANTIC, WITH WONDERFUL MUSIC.  PERFECTLY CAST:  WHO DOESN'T LOVE MAGGIE SMITH! AND THE OTHER MAIN CAST MEMBERS ARE JUST AS GOOD.  THE BACKGROUND OF A ROMANTIC HISTORY UNFOLDS DURING THE CURRENT DRAMA OF A GREAT PERFORMER OVERCOMING FEARS.  ALSO A STRONG THEME:  RESPECT FOR OLDER PEOPLE.
0425263924|5.0|This is an awesome book! Cant wait to read number 4 and see what happens with this amazing love story!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Never have to worry about looking for my hard cover dictionary because I have my kindle HD in the palm of my hands!
B0045HCIZY|4.0|I recently saw \\"Before Midnight\\" in the theatre and after that I simply had to re-watch \\"Before Sunset\\" for the first time in 9 years. Strange as it may sound, I had never watched the very first movie in this series, so finally I gave in and saw this.<br /><br />\\"Before Sunrise\\" (1995 release;  101 min.) brings the story of how Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) and Celine (played by Julie Delpy) meet (on a train to Vienna). The only leap of faith I felt I had to make is that within minutes of starting to talk to each other on the train, Jesse invites Celine for a bite to eat in the train's lounge car, and she accepts, even though at that point he is a complete stranger. But after that it plays out exactly as you would expect it. As in the other two movies, it is basically just those two characters talking and talking, and talking some more. If you are expecting anything else (as apparently some of the reviewers who rated this movie 1 star), please save your time and money and do not watch this. But if you like a talk-movie, this is about as good as it ever gets. The standout scene of this movie is towards the end of the movie, when Celine and Jesse make pretend phone calls to their respective friends and talk/confess about having met someone. Just sublime.<br /><br />Equally interesting is to see how Jesse and Celine have evolved as characters in the subsequent movies (and how Hawke and Delpy have evolved as actors in these roles). The contrast between \\"Before Sunrise\\" and \\"Before Midnight\\" is stark on many levels, as it should be, given that 18 years has passed. And not always pretty. But it makes for fascinating viewing. I'm already looking forward to the next installment of this series in 2022 (gasp!).
B0012NO4WO|4.0|Good suspense, a very pretty girl and interesting action.<br /><br />Believable action sometimes, terrible, crazy villain.<br /><br />I doubt the bus could have made the jump.
B005FJ7DOM|3.0|A couple of years ago I read Justin Cronin's post-apocalyptic vampire epic \\"The Passage.\\" Last night I watched \\"Stake Land,\\" and if I didn't know better, I would say this film was STRONGLY influenced by Cronin's novel. This movie's vision of a fragmented America barely surving in the wake of some unexplained vampire apocalypse could easily have been based on a few chapters of Cronin's novel that were edited out before it was published. So IF a proper film adaptation of \\"The Passage\\" ever makes it to the big screen, anyone who has already seen THIS film will think to themselves, \\"Been there, done that.\\" That having been said, this movie is OK but not especially groundbreaking in this day and age.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Very difficult to do a lot of the puzzles because the background is so dark. It would be nice if you could change the background color.  Since getting my Kindle with the larger screen the puzzle pieces are a really strange shape and can't be changed.
B009POCFTG|1.0|I was so disappointed that Matthew McConaughey would act in a movie like this.  I found it disgusting with all the unnecessary sexual innuendos.  He was nothing but a pedophile in this movie.  I would not recommend this movie to my worse enemy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is clever and is challenging but not overly so.  Definitely fun me me and my kids (11 &amp; 14)
B00CELB94E|4.0|Let me admit upfront that I was (still am) a huge fan of Beady Eye's debut album \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\", which I had as my No. 1 album of the year for 2011 (and which I thought was miles better than Noel Gallagher's debut album--a view that is not shared by many, I fully realize). As soon as I saw that the new Beady Eye album was out, I immediately ordered it from Amazon's UK website. As it turns out, the price difference for the regular album and the deluxe edition there is next to nothing, so I gladly ordered the deluxe edition with its 4 extra tracks.<br /><br />\\"BE\\" (deluxe edition; 15 tracks; 64 min.) starts off with a nice \\"Flick of the Fingers\\", with horns and brass upfront. \\"Soul Love\\" slows things down, and has a 2 min. outro that is about 1 1/2 too long. \\"Face The Crowd\\" is a hard-charging rocker. \\"Second Bite of the Apple\\" (1st UK single) \\"borrows\\" liberally from The Zombies' \\"Time of the Seasons\\". \\"Lz Rite\\" is a great 60s-sounding track. \\"I'm Just Saying\\" is about as Oasis-sounding as anything on here (with a great opening line \\"You might think the grass is greener/Here I am on the other side\\"). The first half of the album is excellent and I rate it 4.5 stars. However, the guys (all songs are credited to Gallagher/Archer/Bell) cannot keep the momentum up in the second half of the album, starting with the 8 min. \\"Don't Bother Me\\" (which initially sounds to be another \\"Champaign Supernova\\", except the 4 min. soft instrumental outro just goes on and on). Most songs after that are in a similar slow, pensive vein, leading to a lack of energy in the album's second half (check \\"Ballroom Figured\\" and \\"Start Atop\\"). The 4 extra tracks from the deluxe edition are quite good. The best of these are the 2 min. \\"Dreaming of Some Space\\", drenched in mid-60s psychedelia, and \\"The World's Not Set In Stone\\" rocking nicely.<br /><br />Bottom line, this album is not bad, but at the same time I feel that it falls short of \\"Different Gear\\", an opinion I know will not be shared by many, looking at most other reviews on here. I just don't hear nearly as many memorable songs and hooks on here, as compared to \\"Different Gear\\". I had the good fortune of seeing Beady Eye live at the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC when they were touring in support of the debut album, and they put on a tremendous set (but no Oasis songs). And Liam remains one of rock's best lead singers. As to \\"BE\\", if you're going to buy the album, make sure you get the deluxe edition for just pennies more.t be shared by many, looking at most other reviews on here.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|this product completely sucks for real though there are other things to do when you pause it like near a train and when you go back you die so i personally think you should kind of update the game.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We first got this jumperoo two years ago for my daughters first Christmas.  She was 7 months old at the time.  She enjoyed the seat and used it occasionally but it was never really her favorite.  She was just beginning to crawl and was more interested in moving around on the floor.<br /><br />Now with my second daughter we were able to get this seat out for her when she was first big enough to fit into it, which was around 3 months old.  She has absolutely loved it from the first time we put her in it.  Sometimes she'll jump as hard as she can, while others she'll just pull at some of the toys while resting in the seat.  It is the first thing I'll put her in when I have to get something done.<br /><br />I've decided I think the big difference between my two girls is the ages in which they started using the product.  My first daughter was old enough that jumping wasn't as exciting for her anymore.  She had other ways of moving around and it just didn't keep her attention enough.  Therefore I think this is probably best up until your baby really starts to crawl around and be more mobile.  My daughter is 6 months old now and not quite crawling yet so she is still really enjoying it.  It is a product that has a fairly limited time span for a child, but I think it is worth it for how much fun they have with it.<br /><br />The product has held up really well after being taken apart and put back together between children.  The quality is great and it still looks like new.  I'm sure I will be able to use it again if I have more children in the future, which helps to make it worth the somewhat steep price.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Do not like the layout. I like the current temp, but if I wanted to look at other data I would select another screen. This has the info, just not the presentation.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is a great movie, I would recommend it to anyone.  It deserved the Best Picture award.  Will watch this one more than once!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Instead of calling this game [[ASIN:B006N0YWGY Shine Runner]] I would have called it as Hovercraft Derby! - This game delivers fast paced graphics and works beautifully on new generation of tablets. It also works fine on original Kindle fire. The controls are \\"touchy\\" and it is hard to get 'floating cash' on the screen because of the incredible speeds at which the hovercraft flies across the swamps & crazy routes.<br /><br />This is no race game but more of hi·lar·i·ous hovercraft destruction derby of some sorts and earn cash on the way which can be used to purchase goods and sell them to make more money :) The game offers tons of laughs & fun and can easily entertain you for hours. The included maps offers excellent quality graphics in daylight with very good water effects, night with moon, fireflies and tons of wooden house structures & police hovercraft to bump into and destroy things. The goal is not to destroy but merely to collect cash on the way but as the hovercraft has no brakes :) you inevitably destroy things by going out of control and crashing endlessly.<br /><br />Overall the game offers pure fun game-play and worthy of 4 stars. If developer adds better control of the hovercraft then it has the potential to become five star game.<br /><br />I do recommended this game for pure fun & high quality graphics!
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|Puzzles make good practice to build your skills for the game.  Still exploring it, but I like it a lot so far. Developers removed permission for location, although that didn't bother me since my device doesn't have good.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|The game was not very challenging. Hopefully the other levels will get harder. The graphics are very pretty though. It was cheap so I guess it was worth the money.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Thank Goodness. Oh how I could write so much... but I won't go in to all the drama. It is truly joyous to hear the music and the sound signatures of Queensryche return! The music is awesome and Todd La Torre's voice is a perfect match. He brings enough to the game that he is more than a Tate clone... but there are moments that I forget that it is not Geoff... that is how seamless this record is. This is Queensryche.<br /><br />There are standout tracks but all of it is a welcome relief to much of what is being released today. I really enjoy the instrumental lead in tracks... just like what Sabbath used to do.<br /><br />If you love Queensryche and have been waiting like I have for that unique sound that elevated them.... this is it. Good luck in the court case boys. The only thing anyone has to do is to match up Queensryche (2013) against Frequency Unknown. It is pretty easy to say which group really is Queensryche. He has huge ego, but I bet Geoff Tate is amazed by this offering from Michael, Scott, and Eddie... he should have taken more time.<br /><br />I can't give this 5 stars because it is not a classic album.... but 4 stars because it is classic ryche.

B004TI5N38|4.0|David Baldacci is an excellent writer.  This book takes John Puller into the hills of West Virginia in search of a multiple murderer. Against protocol, he is the only army investigator assigned to the case. It really gets exciting when the Department of Homeland Security gets involved.  After the A-Bomb goes off, Baldacci seems to get a little lazy about tieing things off, but on the whole, an excellent book.<br /><br />Richard Ruppel

B00BVYLBP2|5.0|the actress that plays several of the characters in this story is incredible, and should win some sort of award. the other supporting actors are also wonderful. the mystery is often surprising (which is rare, nowadays), and the science fiction, while still far from developed, is not bad, either! well worth the time for you to spend...
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This was by far the worst novel of the trilogy... no discernible story, very little character development, anticlimax after anticlimax, and the pairing continues to be so dysfunctional I can't root for them to make it.  The only reason I give it two stars is for the parts where she writes from Fifty's point of view.  She writes his thoughts better than her heroine's.

B00005RFVL|5.0|After an opening track of his own that sits comfortably with the oldies here, Robbie sings his way through a selection of classic songs from the swing era, whether solo or in duets with others.<br /><br />Among them are Well did you evah?, a song that Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby recorded together, and which must not be confused with Did you ever>, which Frank's daughter Nancy recorded with Lee Hazlewood. Frank and Nancy together recorded Somethin' stupid, here covered by Robbie with Nicole Kidman. They sound great together, but apart from Frank and Nancy's original version, I also have a great version by the Mavericks with Trisha Yearwood.  Here, I also particularly like Things, on which Robbie sings with Jane Horrocks, and Robbie's solo versions of Straighten up and fly right (an early Nat King Cole classic) and Beyond the song (originally the French song La mer by Charles Trenet, but popularized in English by Bobby Darin).<br /><br />This is an excellent album from start to finish  I imagine that Robbie introduced a lot of people far younger than myself to swing music via this album. I  didn't need him to steer me towards that music, but I'm impressed by his recordings of these songs.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a really fun game that is also very addicting the only thing I would complain about is that sometimes when you try to move to another side it will make you roll or jump otherwise it is a really fun game to play especially with all the missions and daily challenges it is great to entertain kids with for hours on end!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also it can also entertain you as well
B009NY43NY|1.0|I cannot believe I waited a year for this. I think she just hurried through to just be done with the series. I was so upset to find out they were gonna end, but if that's how she would have continued on I wouldn't have read the next one!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game as i said its fun and hard but still cool i do have the toy version of robot he is so cool<br /><br />Coooool
B00476Q8KO|4.0|Since I like mythology, this movie was entertaining and fun too watch.  I would definitely watch it again.  Would you?
B00992CF6W|2.0|I got the newest update for Minecraft on my Kindle Fire and I went on one of my survival worlds and there were no buttons/ controls on my screen because before the update there was arrow keys on the screen you pressed now they aren't there. Also my inventory spots don't show up on my main screen, so I have to guess how to guide my guy around because there aren't  any arrow keys on the screen anymore and I don't know what I'm holding in my hand because my inventory slots won't show up. My piont is that Minecraft was better before the new update, unless they decide to come out with a newer update that actually makes the game better.
B001SGEULA|5.0|A very good band with a soothing voice for a frontman. Very good for the price. A good follow up to Whats the Story.
0385349831|1.0|The book is very small,<br />It seems like the pages have been copied, not the original ones<br />The pages have diferent size and are not cut well,<br />Very very poor quality...
1619699826|5.0|What an awesome book written by an awesome author.  Angels Flight was written a few years ago but just recently recorded for audio listening.  The story is so very good and Harry is at his best as always. Each Bosch book I finish becomes my favorite but this is really soooooo good. If you like audio books this is the one for you to listen to.  Keep them coming, I am hooked.
0307476073|2.0|So, how did this mediocre book make it on Opra's list?  Dumb luck?  Or maybe Opra has no taste.  This genre has been done so much better by so many others; take any Paul Theroux book, for example.  I have read many travel/adventure books by many others and I can't remember one so boring and predictable.  Not only is the 1100 mile hike in 100 days not that impressive, but her little adventures along the way weren't  either.  Bill Bryson did a much easier hike on the AT, but at least made novel and interesting observations.  This author simply strung together boring details from her troubled personal life with a hike and somehow got on Opra's list and made a pile of money, I presume.  And for that bit of brilliance, I award her the extra star.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|I like movies based on a true and inspiring story.  Given our current state in the US, this movie leaves you with a &#34;do good&#34; feeling.  If only we could all do a little something for someone in need, we may be able to turn things around.  First off by starting with new politicians!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I like the product because it passes the time if we're stuck in an airport or doctor's office.  Great game.  As always, Amazon was superb with their dellivery.
0743454537|3.0|I liked the story line of this book a lot - I think it brought up some very interesting and important issues.  It was the characters that gave me pause.  Even in the discussion questions and the author's notes at the end of my copy, I disagreed with what Jodi Picoult thought readers should take away from the \\"Sara\\" character, mainly empathy.  Sara was the character I had the most problems with.  I personally think that throughout the story line, she made me dislike Sara more and more, every time she opened her mouth.  From the very beginning, when the first blood was drawn from her daughter, Anna, to transplant into Kate, she blatantly lied to Anna, not telling her what was going to happen to her and how it was going to feel.  She repeatedly guilted Anna into doing whatever she wanted her to do for Kate.  It felt to me that her daughter, Kate, came first and always ahead of her other children.  Everything she did, every decision she made, was to benefit Kate, even if it was at the expense of her other children.  I think that it was her fault that her son was setting fires and that her daughter, Anna, felt invisible.  Although Sara repeatedly said she loved all her children, there was, in my eyes, a definite division of that love - the most going to Kate - whatever was left being divided among the two left standing. I realize Kate was very sick and needed a lot from her, and she was obligated to give her what she needed, but to me it felt as though nothing and no one was more important than Kate. Even when Kate was tired of living this way, Sara still would not let her go.  Coming from a family where one sibling was always treated better than the others and held up in higher esteem, this hits really close to home for me, and that is what I took away from this book.  I know there are plenty of other readers who totally disagree with me, but as I said, this is just MY impression and what I took away from this book.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This will become a testament to one of the greatest innovators of our time.  As I am writing this review I am chuckling to myself as I am writing it using my iPad.  I think Steve is probably some where laughing to himself as well.<br /><br />I really appreciate the raw emotion and searing truth of this biography and Walter has definitely accomplished the goal to tell Steve's story - warts and all.  It serves as a true testament to a great innovator who is truly human.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Reading &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; is like walking into a kitchen full of people and being seduced by the fragrant spices of their cooking perfuming the air.  It is a delicate, invisible tapestry of senses that spirits you into a cosmos so similar to your own, but viewed through the glasses of a sorrow poet.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini inspires me to be a better person.  His books are better than therapy.  His insight into characters is so acutely focussed that I find myself as inspired by their flaws as I am their divinity.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Sounds like old Ryche to me. I am a guy who got into Rage for Order, Mindcrime and Empire during my teens, so I always had a soft spot for those records. This new album sounds fresh, creative and innovative. I mean, it's not reinventing the wheel for metal music, but it's like drinking a cold, cold coke on a very hot afternoon. My favorite tracks are Redemption, Spore and Fallout, but they are all really good songs. I'm happy for these guys because they deserve the support they are getting. Hopefully we will get a more ambitious, proggy Queensryche album from these guys soon. This is the REAL deal.

B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My granddaughter chose this movie for our Kindle because the Monster University was coming out and she wanted to watch this again.  Of course, she's watched it over and over and over again.  It is very entertaining and she just doesn't get tired of watching it.  I highly recommend this movie for children and adults alike.  It's not scary, but just cute...

B00CFQMVLS|3.0|I think this was Bruce Willis ending the DIE HARD series with a smile on his face showing the world that he ended up having a good relationship with his children.  Too bad the public had to pay for his sniveling attitude.

It is pretty simple to use, even for a 57 year old with RA (rheumatoid arthritis)!  The only problem I have with this app, is trying to find out if it's going to be a bad day for a migraine headache.  The whole map never shows completely up.  No matter how I turn my Kindle Fire,just part of the map shows up with blank spaces in between.<br />But other than that it's easy to use.  I open it up first thing in the morning!!  I will give it a 4.5 Star Rating.  Many Thanks ---DEBBIE in Fort Wayne,IN

B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress for this? Silver Linings Playbook is the worst sequence of formulaic movie tropes I've seen in a long, long while. Of all the movies released in 2012, I could pick one out of a hat and it would be better than Silver Linings Playbook.<br /><br />There is nothing original in this movie. It is flippant in places where it needs to be serious, it is trite in places where it needs to be original, and it is formulaic in places where it needs to be insightful. And the soundtrack is cloying.<br /><br />Take the following: \\"Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow. Minus the whore thing, for the most part.\\" Here is a line, bereft of verisimilitude, that is so ingratiating as to be nauseating. Set aside the annoyance that a serious actor could ever deliver such a line with a straight face (and Jennifer Lawrence can't keep one, so conscious of her adoring audience is she--I implore you to go back and look), but, ask yourself what kind of writer could put such a line to paper. That is what people are celebrating here.<br /><br />I was able to leave without pausing when I needed to pee, having predicted the previous half dozen plot moves to my viewing partner--and come back to her report that, \\"It's exactly what you said would happen\\". It was once written by someone--I cannot recall whom at the moment--that a good story will take you to an inevitable conclusion in a way that still surprises you. By logic, a bad story will take you to an inevitable conclusion in a way that is entirely predictable. Silve Linings Playbook is infuriating in its predictability.<br /><br />The problem is not the arc of romantic comedies. The problem is not Hollywood's over-use of The Magic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG's can be charming, done right). The problem is the way in which emotions play out in life. Emotions are sometimes predictable and sometimes not, but they matter to the person having them, and that is a matter worth taking seriously. This movie was not only predictable and dismissive, but it was consistently so all along the way to its inevitable and entirely prosaic denouement.<br /><br />This movie could have been saved (For contrast, Juno, just as nauseating, could never have been saved) with better writing, a cast that showed up to act and without the tortured football metaphor. But I'm the odd man out here. I see that the TomatoMeter has it at 92%. If this is how people see themselves and their romantic involvements, I pity them. And if this movie offers some emollient to those couples who need convincing that they are not in the wrong relationship... it still sucks.nsistently so all along the way to its inevitable and entirely prosaic denouement.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I listened to this book through Audible before seeing the movie and felt the movie did a descent job holding to the book.  The story itself is unique and worth seeing, hearing or reading.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|My older children, ages 19 and 21, had never seen this movie and honestly, they weren't enthused about seeing it when I suggested it. They ended up loving it and continue to quote lines from it! They also continue to clap like the aliens. I think their friends are beginning to wonder about them.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|A 68 year old male friend fell in love with Adele's music through the radio at his workplace.  I bought it for him as a gift and he listens to it every day!  She is passionate and soulful.  What he didn't like, though, was her potty mouth when bantering with the audience.  It didn't bother me a bit---after all, she is young and exuberant.  I enjoyed seeing the real Adele in action.
B00133KFGW|5.0|The young star in this is really wonderful.  Freddie Highmore gives a stellar performance.  Another one of my favorites. This young man was in &#34;Finding Neverland&#34; which is another of my best pics.

0812993845|3.0|I like a lot of the other readers here love Sophie Kinsella books.  This one was a bit disappointing.  The characters are more annoying than anything.  Lottie seems to be a whiny girl who has refused to own her mistakes or see her part in any mishap that occurs.  This was probably my least favorite book.  \\"Can you keep a Secret\\" and \\"I've got your Number\\" are way better.  Definitely disappointed by this last one.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I got this game for my daughter but the amount of time and frugality needed to get anywhere in the game is mind numbing.  I try to earn a pony for her every few days, the biggest bonus is just logging in once a day to get the free bits, but the currency system in the game is painfully slow and to play the minigames you have to have some knowledge of virtual microeconomics because you do run out of bits fast.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I like this movie because it offered a different bent on the Bourne Identity trilogy series.  I actually did not like that trilogy.  I like the original Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberland and J. Smith.
0062024329|1.0|I didn't have any expectations when I opened this book. My husband picked it up from the library and since I like graphic novels, I thought I'd give it a try. I had just finished Noah Gordon's \\"The Last Jew,\\" also set in Andalusia. However, I was irritated just a few pages into it by the ridiculous rendering of the Goddesses of the Forest splashing around in a lake: nearly naked nymphs with hugely surreal breasts and cascading, impossibly long hair. The Alchemist fondly ponders their romp with \\"what a lovely story.\\" Is his comment supposed to be ironic? He's drawn practically drooling as he contemplates these scantily clad women.<br /><br />We soon meet the merchant's daughter, who sports the same freakishly inflated breasts and big hair. Her dress literally is falling off of her hips. This cannot be a period-accurate representation of a typical Andalusian woman. Of course, the protagonist, Santiago (no need to specify male protagonist--ALL of the protagonists in the book are male) completely lusts after her. Who cares what they talked about for two hours--she's hot, right?<br /><br />I could have overlooked both of these issues, however, if it weren't for our first encounter with Fatima. She's modestly wrapped in drab brown fabric from forehead to ankle, and there's no sense of her body shape at all under her gown. Will she be the hero's true love? Certainly--because Fatima is the only woman in the book who looks totally asexual, she is therefore pure and thus worthy of Santiago's attention. Fatima's perceived value is later driven home by the Alchemist: \\"If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil.\\" We see Santiago's response: \\"...the boy knew [the Alchemist] was referring to Fatima.\\" The Alchemist validates Santiago's assessment that only a chaste woman is of any worth.<br /><br />The graphic artist's sexist illustrations are a minor distraction from the thin story line, which can be summarized in one sentence: \\"Life really is generous to thosewho pursue their personal legends.\\" Snooze. Perhaps men reading this book might be led to that conclusion, but what about women? The most that they can hope to achieve in life is to marry a personally-fulfilled, rich guy as long as they wrap themselves in a burka?<br /><br />On a technical note, it's strange to consider the time and effort spent to illustrate this novel, only to start it off with personal letters from the author and contributors that are not typeset or even edited for grammar. In addition, towards the end of the book, there's an unfortunate typo in one of the story's key proverbs: \\"...Everything *that's* happens once can never happen again.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the original novel is more compelling, but I won't bother after this disappointing edition.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|Heard about this band from the Isle of Man youtube video and their song &#34;Faster&#34;. took a chance on buying the album, and i don't regret it. it actually gets better with more listening.  a few of their songs stick in my head afterwards - usually a sign of a good album. they are reminiscent of TransSiberian Orchestra, with their hard rock yet melodic style. album is themed to a graphic novel or similar story, but i havent yet gotten the connection.  yes i'd buy it again
B00979CS50|5.0|This double CD has been played so much that it must be about worn out by now! Vintage Neil with Crazy Horse! Awesome music!
B004W1GCVE|3.0|If you like \\"Downton Abbey,\\" you'll probably like this show because it's another serialized costume drama set in the early 20th century.  I prefer the characters and stories on \\"Downton,\\" but this show is entertaining in its own right.  Season 1 is very short (just 3 episodes).  Season 2 is twice as long and by the end I was pumped for a third season as Britain was on the brink of WWII.  Sadly, there won't be a Season 3.  I never saw the original \\"Upstairs Downstairs,\\" so I can't compare this to that one.  It wasn't until I was finished watching Season 2 that I learned two of the actors from the original series were a part of this updated version.  (I'm not sure if this series is a reboot or a continuation of the original series, but either way it was enjoyable.) The video quality was good but not great (it was a bit grainy at times), and the audio was clear but disappointing because it was mono.  Recommended.
B008MF3OEY|5.0|She just received her kindle fire and THIS cover today for her 16th bday and she absolutely loves this cover.  It fits the kindle well, and it looks like a &#34;real&#34; book which makes it even better for her! Two thumbs up (now I'm going to go get me one!)

0385344228|3.0|Is there a murder gene? How do parents react when their loved one is on the spot? This could have made a fascinating book: it has all the ingredients for a thriller with a good subject, good trial drama and intense family situations.<br />It did not work for me. I did not connect with the son or with the parents and not even with the trial drama. Maybe it is because all the characters are so well set in their roles: they taste like cardboard, and it goes to the point that they are too predictable, it is not good in a thriller.<br />The book is slow, a bit like these TV series when you skip a week: everybody is at the same place with the same problems when you come back. The book could have been 100 pages shorter.<br />I am real sorry I did not like the book, it could have been great. This is an excellent writer. I am full of hope for the next one.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Wow. I had no idea what an astonishingly ingenious and imaginative individual Tesla was... I'd never even heard of him until recently. And he practically invented the world as we know it. You'd think there would be scores and scores of books about him, that children would learn about him and his multitudes of inventions in school, etc. History and science go hand in hand, and it is my opinion that they should be taught in such a context.

B00AVTMCYW|4.0|Poignant coming of age tale set in the late 1980s yet not too obviously so, nor is the timeframe of any consequence to the moral of the story. This is a story of human connection, frailty, strength, grace, and celebration. It could have taken place in any year and at any stage of life.

Learning about the different artists that helped them along the way, like Linda Ronstadt, Bob Seger, Kenny Rogers, Jackson Brown and on. Really a lot of fun, great story & great music!
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|If ever a TV show needed a no-spoilers review it's this one. The trouble is, everything's a spoiler when \\"Orphan Black\\" is concerned, and the less you know going in, the more fun you'll have with this show's onrushing tidal wave of plot twists and turns.<br /><br />So--what can I tell you that will let you know whether you want to see this or not without spilling all those beans? Well, I'll try.<br /><br />1. Don't see this if you need glossy, upbeat Hollywoody science fiction. There isn't a single Dudly Do-Right in the entire cast of characters. Everyone has issues. Everyone has baggage. Problems can't always be solved by sweet reason, Star Trek style. And who's a Good Guy or a Bad Guy isn't always clear, even when you learn just who and what they are. And with some of the more damaged characters, they can't necessarily be fixed--ever. Some things you can't come back from. And problems don't have quick fixes. That is, there's no pandering to your inner 12 year old. This is a show for grown-ups.<br /><br />There is hope, and character growth, and goodness--but not unmixed, and not come by easily. Think about Egon Schindler of Schindler's List--a womanizer, war profiteer, Nazi collaborator--who also saved over 900 Jews. He'd fit right in here.<br /><br />2. Don't see this if you have to have a saintly, lovable central character who always does the right thing without hesitation. If you're the kind of person who likes to sit in judgement of others, and who thinks nothing in a person's upbringing/environment can excuse anything wrong they do, skip Orphan Black. There's no black and white morality to be had here.<br /><br />3. Skip this if you need your science fiction to be 100% scientifically plausible. The basic premise for the show isn't possible in the timeframe of the show (it's set in present-day Toronto). I forgive the show for this--it would have made the show too expensive to produce if it had been set 40 years in the future. And the show is so character-driven that that this flaw is overshadowed by the rest of it anyway.<br /><br />4. This has moments of sex, violence and bad language that aren't outside the envelope of today's television, but it sure ain't \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" or a Hallmark Special either. And the general intensity level is HIGH. A Russian friend of mine thought it was overacted, but she's the kind of person who expects characters to always respond to events optimally--which I see as a holdover of the \\"Soviet Realism\\" she was raised on--where every show is expected to function as straightforward moral instruction. This show has a moral center, but it doesn't wear it on its sleeve.<br /><br />5. See this if you loved the best of Hitchcock's movies--scary, intelligent, suspenseful, sometimes white-knuckly, more fear, less gore. Don't see this if a little gore is too much for you, though. There's a scene of self-surgery that's rather stomach-churning, though it isn't gratuitous. And it's not the only Ewwww! moment in the show. Forewarned is forearmed.<br /><br />6. See this if you admire great--not good, great--acting. The show's star, 28 year old Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany, from Regina, Saskatchewan, won the Critics' Choice award for Best Actress in a TV Drama (the drama being Orphan Black), dumbfounding all the Hollywood Establishment types who perhaps hadn't even heard of this show.<br /><br />I love great stars like Audrey Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart, who cultivate an onscreen persona and mostly play that throughout their careers. Maslany is a different kind of actor--the kind who can play ANYONE. The kind who can disappear into a role so deeply you forget the actor and only see the character they're playing. She's an actor's actor, like Alec Guinness was. Maslany plays multiple roles in Orphan Black, and in each role she's that person--character, mannerisms, dialect, everything. You're never unclear as to which character you're looking at--including when she's playing one of her characters pretending to be another of her characters.<br /><br />Acting schools will have their students watch Orphan Black to see how it should be done. James Lipton will be camping on Maslany's doorstep to get her on his Actor's Studio interview show.<br /><br />The other characters are well-acted too--particularly the young man who plays the central character's brother. I've seen him in interviews and he's nothing like his character. And it's a role that could have been overplayed; instead it's given a nuanced performance by this actor.<br /><br />7. See it if you like mysteries that gradually answer your questions, without copouts. This isn't like \\"Lost,\\" where the final resolution of the plot left most viewers going \\"Seriously?\\" Not here. You'll have a lot of questions, and you'll get a gradual stream of answers--though many lead to more questions, but those get answered too, and so forth.<br /><br />8. See this if you prefer serialized shows; don't see this if you insist on episodic shows. That is, the first season of Orphan Black is a 430 minute movie. Don't even think of seeing it any other way. You'll be lost, and not in a good way.<br /><br />9. See this if you like to pay attention. Don't try to play this while you're doing a crossword puzzle. You'll miss something important.<br /><br />10. Humor: not much. There are frequent light touches, but mostly it's a drama, and a drama on the white-knuckle side of things. Called it fast-paced is an understatement. My spouse and I returned from our honeymoon in Japan on the last airliner out of Tokyo before they closed the airport due to an incoming typhoon. On our takeoff roll the rain was blowing horizontally. One we were airborne that fully-loaded 747 bounced around as if it was a little Cesna 152. The passengers were audibly gasping in unison every time that huge airplane abruptly dropped a few dozen feet.<br /><br />Orphan Black moves like that.<br /><br />As I said, the show is set in the present day. The science fiction aspects are real but don't involve the visual props of most sci-fi--no space ships, no aliens, no time travel, no teleporting, really very little requiring CGI other than what's needed to put Maslany on the screen in several places at one time. I can think of one little thing, but you only see it briefly and I'd have to give you a spoiler to tell you more.<br /><br />This means that people who don't go for the really futuristic stuff might like this one. On the other hand, those who love the futuristic stuff might question whether this is really sci-fi (it is, though).<br /><br />I hope I've told you enough to get you to see the pilot--provided none of my cautions are a problem for you. I watch way too much TV for my own good, and I've found myself looking forward to the next episode--and season--more than almost any other show I've seen. Right up there with Game of Thrones, only on a miniscule fraction of the budget. And the fact that it delivers so much bang for the budget impresses me, though strictly speaking I suppose I shouldn't give it credit for that.<br /><br />If you need to find out what the plot is, read any of the other reviews here.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a brilliant game for all ages. It updates all the time changing its location and with lots of characters it's my favourite game
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I was not expected that the story is so touchy, I haven't read the book too, but when I watched this movie, this movie successfully gives me the whole picture about that time back there, and it is good to know :) I love the actress as well.
0446615625|1.0|Baldacci has written some excellent stuff in the past such as \\"Zero Day\\" and \\"The Innocent\\" are two that come to mind, but \\"The Camel Club\\" was a real shocker. It was 700 pages of terrible storyline, unconvincing characters and a shocking ending. Don't buy this one! Do yourself a favour, save your time and money and buy something else.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Another classic. I have read it more than once over the years and I still love it. My reading friends have been introduced to it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I am  having so much fun playing this with my mom! We love seeing what each dinosaur evolves into. I love this game.
B000000WFZ|5.0|The music is hauntingly beautiful.  I had heard Gabriel's Oboe several times and had to have a copy for myself.
B0001I561E|4.0|This movie is great fun for the whole family.  Robin Williams is excellent.  I withheld the fifth star because it was pretty expensive.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|One of my favorite shows.  This season moved a little slower, but was still exciting enough to watch every week.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|As someone who really enjoyed [[ASIN:B001OMJGD0 Superman Returns]] - which I know puts me in the minority as far as fanboys are concerned (although, to be fair, also puts me with the the majority of Rotten Tomato movie critics)- I had hoped that Warner Bros. would  give director Bryan Singer the opportunity to make a sequel in the Richard Donner-verse he had reprised in his 2006 film.  However, with the prevailing opinion that Superman Returns was not a good movie and did not do as well as it should have financially because Superman doesn't punch someone, we were given this \\"Man of Steel\\" reboot.  Given my disappointment of a studio doing yet another reboot (on the heels' of last year's too-soon [IMHO] [[ASIN:B009B0JSD0 The Amazing Spider-Man]] reboot), this movie had two strikes against it in my mind when I went to see it.  However, color me \\"pleasantly surprised.\\"<br /><br />Okay, if you're on the fence as to whether to go to see \\"Man of Steel\\" (or buy it on DVD/Blu-Ray), I'll keep this simple.  If you enjoyed the fight scenes between Superman and the Phantom Zone villains in [[ASIN:B000059XUI Superman II]], and would like to see them played out over the course of 40 minutes in a CGI slugfest of punches, explosions, and buildings being demolished \\"Transformers\\"/Michael Bay style, you will love Man of Steel.<br /><br />*Spoilers ahead*  In short, Man of Steel combines the plotlines of the original Superman and Superman II - giving us, once again, the destruction of Krypton to begin the film.  Then the movie proceeds in a non-linear manner, showing us Clark Kent's upbringing, eventually leading to his donning of the iconic Superman suit.  The non-sequential manner of the initial scenes- beginning with Clark as an adult, then as a young child, then as an adult again, then as a teenager, etc.- was initially confusing, but I came to appreciate their merit as the movie progressed.  Eventually General Zod and his henchmen arrive on Earth and the battle royal is on, withSuperman fighting the Phantom Zone villains in Smallville and eventually in Metropolis in an epic clash featuring excellent CGI effects that I found thrilling (even if they go on a bit too long- more on this later).<br /><br />*Casting* Everyone is perfectly cast in this film.  Henry Cavill is excellent as Clark and Superman; I look forward to seeing more of him in the (presumably) inevitable sequel, when hopefully he is given some lighter material to work with instead of constantly having to wear a grim expression as he goes about saving the world.  Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) is excellent as always, as is Russell Crowe (Jor-El), Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent).  Michael Shannon is also good as General Zod, but perhaps falls a bit short of Terence Stamp's almost regal villainy as the original cinematic Zod.  A special word of praise has to be directed to Antje Traue's performance as the Phantom Zone criminal Faora.  Channeling Sarah Douglas' Ursa from Superman I/II, Traue's Faora dishes out death without hesitation or remorse; moving and fighting in a vaguely serpentine manner, she takes pleasure in her killings and destruction, making her a delicious villain to watch.<br /><br />*Soundtrack* I consider John Williams' soundtrack from the [[ASIN:B0012QVJXS Superman: The Movie]] to be not only classic, but iconic; thus, I would have preferred that director Zack Snyder and composer Hans Zimmer retain the Williams theme.  Alas, this was not to be.  The talented Zimmer gives it his best shot and swings for the fences, hitting a solid double with his Man of Steel soundtrack.  It probably won't make you forget the Williams theme (or have you absent-mindedly humming it to yourself, as many Superman fans- myself included- have done with the Williams theme), but it is appropriately epic and even memorable in its main theme.<br /><br />I would have given this movie five stars but for two reasons (again *Spoilers Ahead*):<br /><br />1.  *The movie's length*  At 143 minutes, this movie is probably 30 minutes too long.  In particular, I think the final battle between Superman and Zod could have been trimmed down.  This Superman-Zod fight sequence comes on the heels of an extended battle sequence between Superman, the Phantom Zone villains, and the U.S. military- as a viewer I felt a bit spent.  I love the final battle itself, leading to the brilliant scene depicting  Superman's first choice as to whether to take a life in order to save innocent lives, but I didn't need to see another 10 CGI buildings destroyed with the accompanying explosions.  I'm sorry but eventually endless CGI mayhem gets a bit numbing, and loses its punch (no pun intended).<br /><br />2.  *Where's the joy?*  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Superman learns to fly.  In a manner reminiscent of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man learning to web-sling in [[ASIN:B000O19EWK Spider-Man]], Superman gets the hang of flying and you can see the joy and wonder on his face as he zooms across the world, and eventually into space and back to Earth.  This sequence was one of the few where we see Superman actually experiencing some fun of being a God-like superhuman (as I'm sure we all would feel in his place), and I just wish there were more scenes like that.  Richard Donner really captured this whimsical aspect of the Superman character in his iconic 1978 film, and I think it is regrettable that writer David S. Goyer didn't heed the advice of one of his iconic Batman characters in writing the Man of Steel screenplay: \\"Why so serious?!\\"<br /><br />In summary, Superman is back and I look forward to the next movie installment and hopefully a Justice League movie.  If the next film retains the epic nature/scope of Man of Steel, while upping the \\"fun\\" factor of Superman's character and not going overboard on the CGI, we may have the ultimate Superman movie to look forward to.<br /><br />In the meantime, Man of Steel is a dandy film, and well worth your timeif you are a Superman fan or a fan of action/superhero films in general.  To borrow the catchphrase from the original 1978 movie, you will believe - again - that a man can fly.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Very entertaining movie . Keeps your attention throughout the entire showing. It made for a very enjoyable night home for my wife and I. Amazon Rocks !!!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I watched this movie tonight.  It was very powerful.  It had a tight script and was well acted.  It made me forget about my petty problems and think about what it means to be a good man.<br /><br />I have always like movies that had to do with a person trying to do the right thing risking a lot.  I also have always been interested in movies having to do with standing up for your ideals of what's right against communism, socialism, or Nazism.<br /><br />I am glad I saw this movie and that there are directors and actors willing to make movies that may not make tons of money but make people think.  As well as the director expressing ideas that they have convictions and probably experience with.<br /><br />Kevin
B0063IH60K|1.0|i didnt like it much it was not very much fun for me didtn play like regular solitaire for me
0345529057|5.0|Love the first book in this series.  This is a great price.  I have the hardcovers for home, but for in my car, bag, and at the office I have these cheap paperbacks that I can mistreat.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's not the full set (which isn't finished yet), but it's a good start to the series.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|This story is now famous.  But having just read this, one part of the story that maybe isn't focused on enough is how amazingly well Billy Beans adapted his life in baseball.  Failing baseball at first and then becoming recognized as one of the best, if not THE best GM in the game, is life lesson in itself and a great reason to read this book.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game easy to play time !  Rules are easy and having a time limit and amount of hearts is nice.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Had a hard time thinking of Lee Childs description of Jack Reacher applying to Tom Cruise. But Cruise carries it off pretty well. The movie stays close to the book and I think that helps make it seem more realistic to have Cruise in the role. Well done. More, p[lease.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|Nice game, the control response it's excellent. However, it's too short and completelly lacks of power ups or other stuff that make it more fun.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great fun i lke how you get extra things to help you get by a level and knock all the monkeys down!
0553103547|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read.<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />If you like the HBO TV show, you would love this book, it's even better.  There are lots of deleted scenes and private thoughts of the characters that you don't get in the TV Series.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great game for a rainy afternoon. Big Fish always does it right! Really enjoy the fact that I can play it on my Kindle Fire. Being free is a real bonus. You can't go wrong!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It Is Cool As U Run On Train Track With Jake And His Friend As You Avoid Getting Hit By Train Try It It Is Addictive
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|This movie flowed better than Peter Jacksons other movies, Less drag time in his developement of the charecters. It varies some from the book but overall stays true to the story. entertaining and keeps you involved. I would strongly receommend this movie.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I hope Brad Pit does this book justice.  I loved that it is all interviews with survivors and what they went through.  Fabulous!!!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This was really awesome!!! Each time I got onto my Kindle,straight to Scribblenaughts! But the bad things is that they need more levels,because I completed it in a couple days!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|only got stuck once because game would not respond would not pay for this game. hopefully some of the new ones will be more challenging.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it and the entire time questioned the bad reviews. I have been waiting for more Gideon Cross and have to say I am thrilled this isn't the end. What more could people be looking for? This book was hot and had me turning each page for more. Good read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever. I play it 27/7. Love it!! It gives me challenges that I like and pushes me to complete them. So great! Subway Surfers is officially my number one game.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|A good action packed part of the movie series.....  Good graphics and story line.  Worth the buy i believe so go get it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved that Eva and Gideon fight for their Love.  I love the friendship Eva with Cary. Can't wait to see how the wedding turns out.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|Wasn't as sturdy as I hoped.  But it did the job that I was hoping I could do with it.  Went on two flights and my camera was on my lap with the case.
B00AEFXXZU|2.0|The only thing that makes this movie is how hot the girl is; way to much language and drug use (plus the fights are stupid) I would not recommend this move
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun. I am so glad that I got this game. It is awesome.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really liked it because it looks at mental health in a new light. Sadness happiness so many emotions are packed in this amazing quick read.
0738212415|5.0|I had my doubts if I could learn to draw at my age (59), but this book made a believer out of me. Funny thing is, it was sooooo much fun!!! My family was surprised at my progress and my older sister is getting the book so she can learn as well. This book would be great for age 10 and up. You just need to be able to practice.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|Really awesome movie! I fell in love with all of the characters and the beautiful actors who played them perfectly. Truly an amazing cast!!! Excellent!!!!
B004ZQ74G8|5.0|I was totally immersed in this book from the moment I picked it up. When you think about how technically difficult it would be to write a book like this it is overwhelming.  However, one doesn't think about it until one actually puts it down. And putting it down is not easy.<br />The fact that the author tells the entire story through the perspective of a five-year-old is truly amazing and makes for an unusual and unique read. I think it also makes the writing and the story much more powerful.  It could have easily become trite or been obvious as a tool, but instead it just sucks you into the story and makes it somehow more real.  I haven't enjoyed a novel this much in a long time and it is sticking with me in a way that many novels don't.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very good app. I found it very challenging. The items are sometimes very hard to find or figure out how to use.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|Just love this movie.  I recently rescued a femal chihuahua from shelter and she is as spoiled as Chole.  My Kaydee actually sits and watches it when she hears all the barking.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I have given this rating by otimo artist he is very good and the music he makes. There's no downside to the latter his job.<br />I recommend to all who enjoy this type of music.
B000000ORE|5.0|this also showed up earlier than promised. I had a copy before and lost it. This is a great replacement and the sound quality is very good.
037582913X|5.0|I read this to my daughter when she was young will all the dramatics I could muster. She loved it and so do her two children a Girl & a Boy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am not sure how I feel yet..... I need to process my feelings toward the ending of the book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very entertaining. I love solving puzzles so this is the perfect game for me. A fun way to pass some time.
B00CE004XM|5.0|Along comes Beth Hart with Joe Banamassa. What a special pairing they make.  They seem to bring out the best in each other. I have always been a great fan of Etta James and Beth can sing the heck out of her songs. I definately want to see more front this dynamic duo.
B000M341RI|5.0|The sound track really enhances this film. Glad to hear it received such great recognition! The British accents are a bit &#34;thick&#34; at times so it warrants another viewing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game, but it's too short. I finished in less than an hour. Once new levels expand it a bit, it will definitely be a keeper.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|If you like the books by Jane Austen as well as the thrilling books by P.D.James - you would definitely enjoy this book. P.D.James has managed to keep Jane Austen's style, you really do feel that this is part II of Pride and Prejudice - at the same time - this is a true detective story. Do not read book if you haven't read \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (or if you do not enjoy Austen's books). I enjoyed it thoroughly!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun to play highly recommend it to all. Very easy to play great for all ages graphics are good.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is my first Joe Banamassa Cd. WOW; are they all this good? I have been meaning to check out his music for quite some time now. But when I saw that he recourded an acoustic set in the Vienna Opera House I knew he had to be someone very special so I ordered the set.  FANTASTIC CD! This man can play!  Now I have to have more of his music. Three more this week and they just keep on satisfying my love of the blues. If you want to hear the blues at their finest pick up a Joe Banamassa Cd.  You wont be disappointed I promis.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Damn good. Love it. best ever. Would recommend this to everyone to watch. You thought all of the other ones were good. This one tops it. Thanks
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app.  Use it all the time.  Looks great and easy to use.  I looked at other calculators and this one is the best for everyday use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and shared this app. It became the amazing race for the family. Sorry it ended so soon. Wondering if the seeing eye symbol is a clue to the next level. Reminds me of National Treasure the movie.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|love the series, finally reading the books. Quite a bargain for all 4 books. hardback was too heavy to hold.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's once again, classic Rapp and Kennedy saving the world...but both are getting kind of old to be doing this alone!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great!  I loved the challenge and can even play it with my kids.  Gonna look for more games made by these guys.  Never gets boring.
030759565X|5.0|In 2006 I vowed not buy any more cookbooks.  In 2013, I checked out &#34;Smitten Kitchen  Cookbook&#34; from the library.  I had to own it.<br />First, there were so many recipes that I really would try.<br />Second, the prose is good reading on it's own.<br />Third, I just couldn't get over the fact that the cooking is done in a New York kitchen.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|Robert De Niro and Robin Williams are spectacular and this movie deeply touches the soul.  Excellent story of loving those where they are.
1609611543|5.0|I have not started this book yet, my husband is reading it before I am. He just started the book and stated to me that \\"everybody\\" should read this book. His exact words \\" wow! very-very informative.a EYE-OPENER for sure\\"
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not quite as good as the first two but an enjoyable read just the same. I had to finish the series.

0374533571|5.0|I saw the movie so to me it makes the book that much better. I could relate to the characters better. This was a thoroughly enjoyable book and movie and I would recommend it to everyone.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Good game for passing time and doing nothing but mindless matching.very addictive. Good game for kids as well.fun fun fun
B004TWOXIU|5.0|Both Mario Cavaradosi and Floria Tosca are excellent actors and singers. Also Scarpia, terrific, a wonderful performance. I truly recommend it.
1401937519|5.0|I have read many books on near death experiences and life between lives. Anita's book is written right from the heart. I encourage others to read it, too. You will be pleasantly surprised!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this with little expectations of enjoying, but I am pleased to say that my son loves playing this game. I wish I could give it more stars.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|I liked the plot and felt like the directors had something original going... but it just kind of fell flat towards the end, went from shocking to completely predictable about half way through. Still worth renting and definitely a fun fright night weekend flick!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book about Teasla. All who read it will enjoy and be inspired by the writers presentation. Reccomend highly.
B00142X56Y|5.0|The beloved Magic Flute here encounters its very best performance. The Queen of the Night is out of series. Everything is arranged in order to produce a result of the highest quality.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|Simply put this is the most profoundly beautiful film I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. One caveat, I'm a male so that just goes to show the mystique of this film is genuine.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game and I was really happy that it was free.  Wish everything wasn't so expensive like the saddles, clothes, etc. I'm not one who likes to buy pretend stuff for real money.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This book is very helpful and when I need some somebeneficial look ups .Thanks New Oxford American dictionary. For helping
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game. It's a lot of fun on those long boring trips and it's fun to compete against friends!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Very fun need more multiplayer. I think they should give more free gold coins woop woop. Download this for sure
B004EKCNMA|2.0|I actually could not finish it, I felt it was too boring.  But I could see where others would like it a lot.  It's a Christmas Carol with an interesting twist.  It just couldn't hold my attention.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|I gave this game 5 stars but for some reason it disconnected me from Facebook and took all the upgrade  I already bought. Including all my boards, characters, jetpack, magnet, sneakers, score boost, and my highscore!! Which I was very proud of. I had the number one of my friends and it took me almost an hour on one continuous life to achieve this. I'm very upset and I can't seem to get it back. I uninstalled and reinstalled but still won't fix. It's even more messed up because I've spent real money on this game to buy the upgrades that are now gone!!! PLEASE FIX NOW OR I WILL REFUSE TO CONTINUE PLAYING.
B003WJ81MA|4.0|Would it not be for one iconic performance, Legend would be remembered as a piece of pure 80's cheese. The film with a troubled production history, where Tom Cruise played a child of the forest.<br />Thankfully it is so much more then that. The costumes and makeup are all around perfect, and Cruise manages to pull off his role. He's actually not that bad! Mia Sara fares better as the lovely princess. The scenery and cinematography are obviously sets, but great sets they are. The sound editing is excellent too; with bird chirps and forest ambiance giving the impression of a real forest.<br /><br />But that is all merely forgettable. Ridley Scott is a damn good director (Watch Alien or Blade Runner if you need reminding), but he feels hampered and held back here. The film is cheesy in parts, and simple in others. The plot is simple and childish. But the film is saved by one incredible performance:<br /><br />Tim Curry as Darkness. And what a performance it is! Scott and Co. (Makeup artist Rob Bottin in particular) got everything right, from the diabolic design, to the horns and hoofs, to the blood red prosthetics, to the deep baritone voice, to the dialogue, to the character, to the chilling evil laugh....everything is brilliant! And talk about dedication! Tim Curry sat in the makeup chair 6 hours a day, wearing heavy prosthetics, makeup, and costumes to deliver one of the most towering, menacing, iconic, brilliant villains in a fantasy film. He steals every scene he is in, menacing both physically and sensually. The perfect embodiment of pure evil.<br /><br />\\"Let the age of Darkness begin!\\"

B006LEHOL2|5.0|I'll just echo what the majority of others have said about this CD: It's fantastic, one of her three best albums for certain, and very possibly her best. I'm not sure there's ever been an artist treated more wrongly by the public. People forget that the whole tearing-up-the-Pope's-photo thing was a protest against sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church, and she did that years BEFORE the scandals broke. The world owes her an apology that she will never receive (did the Dixie Chicks ever get one? No.). While I've been disappointed with many of her albums since that event and cannot blame her fall from popularity completely on it, I am ecstatic to hear this album and know she's as relevant today as ever. Good on you, Sinead!
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|This is one of my favorite M.N.S. movies! I can usually guess what is going on by the end of a horror movie, but with this one I couldn't which makes it great in itself. I love the last line of the movie, and indeed it does give comfort in the world we live in today. Can't really say much else about the movie without giving it away, but I also like that it doesn't really feature &#34;Big&#34; names in the movie industry. I think that adds to it. I am an M.N.S. fan, and while I haven't liked some of his movies, this one IS probably the best to me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book. It has great insights on the nature of war, and also is great science fiction. Buy it. Read it.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I see where some reviews are shocked by their behavior, but this was the time when The Carpenters probably wild. As a long time Eagles fan this is worth it for the concert alone, so glad they had a old concert with Randy Meisner on vocals, you can't beat him doing take it to the limit & his harmonys. The History dvd's were great, loved the old interviews! Now they need to make a 3 dvd set like this about Linda Ronstadt with an old concert from the 70's
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|The developers don't support the Amazon version. The new version has been on Google Play for a month but they won't release it on the Amazon Appstore because they don't own a crappy Kindle device so they can't test it. This sucks for those of us that unfortunately bought it from Amazon even though we don't have Kindles. If I was able to get my money back I would go buy the app from Google but I hate the idea of paying for it twice.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is by far one of my absolute favorite novels!! I already have the book, so I downloaded this through Kindle. I must say the themes of love, loss, betrayal are all wrapped up so perfectly and well thought out it this book. I've probably read it at least 10 times. It's a good read, without all the trashiness that seem to be mainstream in today's &#34;literature.&#34;
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Yes, Channing Tatum is a doll, and we all live to hear him deliver his quippy lines and see his cute little smile - but let's face it:  once you've seen this movie all the way through the first time, owning the DVD just let's you skip ahead to the 'good parts' in every subsequent viewing  ;-)<br /><br />* Skip the lead-up and go straight to Matthew Mc's opening dialogue at the strip club (so funny!).  The scene in the back room where all the strippers are grooming themselves before the show is effing hilarious.  Then watch the dance numbers that follow - nice!<br /><br />* Skip to the scene where Matthew Mc' is teaching the new young guy to dance.  You will fall out of your dress laughing.<br /><br />* Skip past all the dialogue and 'plot' to the scene when the female lead first sees 'Mike' dance.  Have on hand something to fan yourself with.<br /><br />* Now just fast forward until you see dancing.  Seriously, the plot and dialogue are of no consequence.  Tatums's hip-hop number is amazing.<br /><br />* Do not miss Matthew Mc's final scene, where he takes the stage himself to entertain the ladies one last time.  Hysterically funny, plus you get to see his highly toned legs and backside - that's worth the price of the DVD all by itself.  ;-)
B008J34466|5.0|Excellent CD! Enjoyed every song! Work is evident in the playlist, love love love this CD, AND WOULD RECOMEND IT
0061122416|5.0|There are a few books that I won't get on Kindle because they are such treasures that I want to physically own them.  I took a chance that this would be one of them, and I was right.  I bought a second for a friend's daughter who will be graduating high school.  It is the perfect story for a graduate about to go on a journey to find herself.  I'll read this again and again.
B009LITFIK|5.0|snapped right on, easy to clean and see through, what's not to like. got here a little quicker than promised which was nice too.
B000FC1192|5.0|My child loves the movie Coraline and honestly I do, too! I thought I would read the book to see if it was just as good, and it was! Although some may be a little disappointed that there is no Wybie in the book (esp. if you watched the movie first, and then read the book like I did). I can't wait until my kid gets a little older so we can read this one together.
B00026WU7I|5.0|In a myriad of amazing albums by an iconic artist, Blood on the Tracks is a stand out.  I used to own this on LP (WAY back in the day); just recently decided to repurchase it on cd and listened to it start-to-finish for the first time in probably 20 years.  I was absolutely transported.

B0051MKNV8|4.0|Is it possible that the mind could be totally tapped for all its potential? This movie explores that premise with the usual corny and false idea that a person only uses a small fraction of their brain. We all use 100% of our brains. It is just that some brains work better than others. Given that minor flaw, I loved the story and wished I could take a pill that made me a super genius. Dream on. But it was instructive, I thought, that given a super brain doesn't automatically make one more moral or able to make good choices. That seems to be a different power altogether.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think I can't stop playing it because this game<br />Is so fun I don't want to stop  playing because<br />This game is the best I recommend  you kindle<br />Fire users to buy this game. And u gaming people.<br />I think this is the app for u.

B008JFUPLC|3.0|Monsters University is an enjoyable film, a riff on the college comedy, borrowing liberally from \\"Revenge of the Nerds.\\"  But the more I think about it, the more problems I detect with its execution.  Which is maybe further proof that it's better just to watch movies (especially summer-release movies) and not think about them.<br /><br />To begin with, what age group is this made for?  Tonally, it's definitely pitched at kids - it lacks the kind of deeper resonance that has made Pixar films favorites among adults for the last decade.  And I'm okay with that, these days I'm feeling like we need to let Pixar off the hook a little, and let them just make decent kids' movies.  But does \\"Monsters U\\" work as a kid's movie? The premise of \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" felt a little difficult for children to grasp, and it's even more so here.  You need to understand that in the monster world, children's screams are a valuable source of energy, and the monsters evoking those screams are just doing their job.  But what does a first grader understand about energy production and usage? Do they really get that the TV and dishwasher and nightlight all work because of the coal plant?  I doubt it.  The first movie hedged this bet effectively, both by explaining it to death, and by forging a paternal bond between Sully and Boo.  When watching \\"Monsters, Inc.,\\" a five year old doesn't need to understand the dynamics of energy production in the monster world to understand who the good guys are; they see Sully cuddling Boo, and they get it.  But in \\"Monsters University,\\"  there's no Boo.  There's no explanation either.  The children are scarce, and when they appear, are a source of energy, and nothing else.  How does that play for a five-year-old, especially one who hasn't seen the first movie?<br /><br />Serving as a prequel to \\"Monsters, Inc,\\" we get to know one-eyed, walking ping-pong ball Mike Wazowsky and intimidating-except-for-the-purple-polka-dots Jimmy Sullivan (Sully) as polar opposite students.  Mike is all book knowledge and technique; he can ace a pop quiz and demonstrate zombie drooling with profiency, but can't spook a tabby cat to save his life. Sully comes from a family of prestigious scarers, and skates on his reputation; he's got a mighty roar and intimidating physique, but not much else.<br /><br />The two are rivals until they get kicked out of scare school (for the dumbest of reasons) and must find a way to prove to the dean (Helen Mirren, onscreen as a creepy cross between a dragon and a centipede) that they have what it takes to be truly scary.  The path to victory has them enlisting a fraternity of lovable losers and competing in the scare games, which bear more than a slight resemblance to the Triwizard Tournament in Harry Potter.<br /><br />Surprisingly, \\"Monsters University\\" never deals with its biggest plot point: Mike loves scaring but just isn't scary.  Where does he fit?  Everyone around him says \\"nowhere,\\" including the dean of the school, who relegates him to classes on can manufacturing.  Anyone who's seen (and remembers) the first film knows that Mike never manages to become scary. In \\"Monsters, Inc.,\\" He's basically Sulley's handler, but in the timeline of \\"Monsters U,\\" that job doesn't exist. (Until the montage at the very end, when suddenly it does.)<br /><br />What changed? Since Pixar movies generally try to play by the same rules as the real world, you would assume that the change didn't happen easily.  No corporation is going to employ two people to do the same job they used to get done with just one person. Mike and Sully would have had to fight hard, and demonstrate compellingly, that the handler position was necessary.  There would have to be some kind of sea change in the scaring industry.  This is a movie I'd like to see; it'd be a creative take on the \\"workplace crusader\\" genre.  Granted, it would be hard to make it kid-friendly, but Pixar has never before shied away from a challenge (for heaven's sake, \\"Wall-E\\" was about a lone robot stranded on a garbage suffocated planet, but they made THAT kid-friendly) but that's not the movie that got made.<br /><br />But I'll confess, willingly, that this is just me grousing, because that's what I do - I think, and I grouse. There's a lot to like about \\"Monsters University,\\" but none of it is all that interesting to write about.  The animation is beautiful, as it always is.  There's a lot of fun attention to detail on the college campus.  The voice work is very good, and I'll give a special shout-out to Helen Mirren, who makes Dean Hardscrabble quietly scary.  The supporting characters are fun variations on old stereotypes. It's well-paced, and never feels like it's trying too hard.  And so forth.<br /><br />A lot of ink (or... pixels?  what-have-you) about the decline of Pixar, and \\"Monsters University\\" does nothing to reverse that trend. It's about on-par with \\"Brave,\\" (not the adherence to formula in both) better than \\"Cars 2,\\" and not even approaching the four films before that.  I'd say that at this point, Pixar has settled in to making perfectly adequate kids' entertainment, similar in quality and style to DreamWorks.  They're not annoying, and they're better crafted than most. They're not the uncontested champs in the animation world anymore, but they're still top tier. What's so wrong with that?

0345529057|5.0|Thats all that sums it up. I started doing bad in my classes because I couldn't put these books down. G.R.R.M. is an amazing writer and my only complaint is having to wait for the last few books. Especially after reading the 5th book. Those nasty cliff hangers and his amazing yet horrible way of knocking off the best characters. I must say that these books are some of the best I've read.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|I find this a very difficult, even painful, review to write.  Considering the fact that Pride and Prejudice (P&P) by Jane Austen is my favorite classic and P.D. James is a favorite mystery author, I thought this was a sure winner.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This book lacked all the humor and insight found in P&P and all the interest of a usual mystery by this author.  If it hadn't been for the fact that the characters had the same names and positions in society that they had in P&P, that it was situated at Pemberley, and that portions of the story from P&P were rehashed at times, I would have never recognized it as being drawn from P&P.  At best it's really just historic fiction that is a mediocre mystery that's depressing and dull.  And, unfortunately, that's the best I can say about it<br /><br />I found the Prologue mildly interesting, because it was an opportunity to see some of the original P&P story through the eyes of others -- especially their gossip.  However, the Prologue held promise that was not fulfilled by the remainder of the story.  I realize this is a mystery based on a tragedy that occurred, but even small flashes of the humor seen in P&P or small peeks into personalities and relationships would have elevated this story far above where it landed.  The main characters of Elizabeth and Darcy fall completely flat, secondary characters are handled with even less care, and the story is completely uninteresting.  If it weren't supposed to have been based on the P&P story, I doubt if I would've even bothered to finish the book...and a book has to be pretty bad for me to feel that way.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />I particularly take issue with the way the mystery is explained:<br /><br />1) Louisa grew up on the Pemberley estate, as did Wickham.  They would have been well acquainted with one another, so I find it completely unbelievable that she did not recognize him at all.<br /><br />2) Wickham never saved a dime or cared to.  He leftlarge debts behind him wherever he went and never gave a second thought to the people he was indebted to, because he only cared about his own comfort and the style in which he could live.  So, again, I find it completely unbelievable that he would sleep in the woods to save a little money.<br /><br />**END SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Maybe someone who never read Pride and Prejudice would enjoy this story a little, but, if you like P&P at all, I fear you will be greatly disappointed with this book.  And if you're a fan of P.D. James, this is far from her best work.  I probably should've given this book only 1 star, but out of respect to the author, I'm giving it 2.  I'm sorry to say that I believe the author and her publisher took advantage of her fans as well as those of Jane Austen in an attempt to cash in on this story.  And I believe she owes us all an apology.
034580404X|3.0|I remember starting to read this story on a Fan Fiction website before it was ever published as a book. I can remember starting...that's about it because the writing style is so blunt and slightly childish I couldn't continue to read it. The content is interesting which is why its gotten so popular, but that can be attributed to peoples attraction to cheap sex scenes and perversion. I got these books in hopes of being surprised and reading a much improved version, but I was wrong. I didn't even finish the second book. I ended up lending them out and then stashing them in my closet. Like I said the content is interesting and can draw attention, but I have read far better even just on the Fan Fiction websites, this one probably should have stayed on the amateur sites. As for the shipping and quality of the items bought it was just as expected and I have no complaints.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I forced myself to listen to the entire thing once for the sake of fairness.  Then I promptly gave it my friend who has bad taste in music.  I like Kanye but this was plain garbage.  I suspect he's jumped the shark.  I honestly don't think he has any concept what constitutes good music anymore.
B008GGA5EQ|1.0|I was really disturbed by the book. I strongly dislike it and had to stop 60% into it. It is so wrong to keep reading it. I was expecting some steamy erotica, this was just wrong. It is a very depraved woman who gets kidnapped and arguably raped. She finds herself enjoying the rapes - which is where this story goes so deeply wrong. It's almost like the sick story some defense attorney would come up with in a rape trial. The sex is NOT hot. Almost all is wham bam and done, yet this character keeps getting off on it. Whatever floats your boat, but billing rapes and true captivity makes too light of the serious issues of sex trafficking in our world.<br />This book might have had potential to be more like captive in the dark but due to the language barrier you can't bond with the bad guys and this chick is so twisted I found her to be a really awful person who probably has mental illness.<br />I will note that I enjoy reading erotica and I enjoy reading bdsm, but this wasn't like those at all. I'm deleting this from my account, too wrong to keep it around.
1250004217|5.0|Poignant and heartbreaking.  A reminder of what we must never forget, the<br />holocaust and its aftermath.  Beautifully and sensitively written.
B00ACP3OOM|3.0|It's not a bad unit but I prefer the older SwimMP3.  Do you really think you need to see the track info while swimming?  Aren't you just going to drop a group of tunes, any of which you'd be willing to listen to, on the unit before leaving home?  So why have a big display box on your head that you don't need.  It's a needless function that drives up the cost.  Find an older unit on eBay or somewhere and save some bucks.<br /><br />FAIR WARNING: read the reviews (especially for the older unit) and look at the service model imposed by Finis.  It is not real time, but rather a email \\"ticket\\" system.  It works like this: you contact Finis with problem or question, a day or two days later you get a generic \\"canned\\" response.  You respond again, another day or two goes by, and then you get another response, usually questions that you've already answered.  About the third or fourth go-around, you'll get an actual response that is direct and helpful, but now a week or more has elapsed.  One of the other comments called it \\"foot dragging\\" and I think that's fair.  Seems like Finis tries to weed out a lot of support requests through attrition.  Why not have a \\"real time\\" response system?
0553801473|5.0|i liked this whole series of books and this one doesn't disappoint. other than the occasional \\"what happened to rickon?\\" type moments that seem to happen in all of this series books.<br />but be aware it will make the show slightly less enjoyable. i wish i didn't know about the red wedding and now i know so much more. i'll still watch anyway.<br />i also wish he could put these out a bit quicker.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|First of all, this type of series usually is not something I gravitate to.  But, on a recommendation by a friend, I watched GOT season 1 and was hooked.  Bought this as a gift, knowing full well I would have access whenever I wanted to watch.  It is so believable and the characters so well articulated that I can't wait for season 3 to come out on DVD so I can watch the entire story again.  I have to admit that HBO did a free weekend recently and I was front and center for all 3 seasons.  I am saddened by the number of characters who have met their demise already, but the story has to develop.  I am seriously contemplating buying both seasons for my video library, with a preorder on the 3rd.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As usual,  this book is amazing.  In what I THOUGHT  was the conclusion to the series,  I was continuously enthralled with the story.  I have fallen in love with the series and even though I must wait for the final book,  I'm excited because that means one more book!  HOT  HOT HOT!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Ordered the black on a Sun. and it arrived on Wed. Opened the box and immediately ordered the green one. it arrived 3 days later. I can't say enough about the look, feel, and overall quality of these watches. Seiko automatics for around 50-60 dollars! Dont know how you can beat that price? The watches are on the small side but I have small wrists so they seem to fit perfectly. I have an Omega Seamaster auto and have had to replace the mainspring twice costing over $200 each time. Can't tell how long these will last yet, but for $60 I'll just buy new ones if they break after 3 year warranty is up. I would highly recommend these watches to anyone who wants a simple nice looking everyday casual watch. Also, not having to change batteries is a definite benefit.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Wonderfully done & produced. Gritty, bloody and heart-wrenching account of the Island hopping campaign in the Pacific. Characters were hard to distinguish at times due to the mud-covered costumes they wore. It makes you realize 21st-Century USA is totally unprepared to support the kind of total war the &#34;Greatest Generation&#34; fought and supported stateside. If faced with a similar conflagration I think our current leaders would &#34;sit it out&#34;.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeff Archer is an  outstanding writer.<br />He keeps you guessing. His ending was spectacular. Never expected it.  You can be sure I will be waiting with baited breath<br />for the 4th of the series.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Great movie. Just when you thought you figured things out you didn't. What happened to Channing Tatum's character upset me though. Didn't expect it. One to watch.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The beauty of this book is that depending on which viewpoint you adopt while reading it, the experience is unique. As a book about a circus, ignoring the humans that inhabit or visit it, there are wonders for all your senses. Or you can read it as a tragedy about \\"fathers\\" and their imagined creations a la Frankenstein. Or from the lens of how your actual or perceived opponents shape your life using AH and Prospero, Marco and Celia, Tsukiko and Hinata, etc. And so many more choices of perspective ... as many as there are striped tents that magically show up with a new experience and chance for the visitor to be enchanted while becoming more self-aware.
B001974DG0|5.0|I am a Big fan of the author, but he has yet to surpass this one.  All the themes he has subsequently become known for, distilled to perfection in a single book where your desire for the characters' well being and &#34;happy ending&#34; is almost painful at times.  A must read.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|This film is caught up in a whole set of rather odd philosophical ideas that are somewhat pervasive in modern culture. The primary one being the religion of the alien.<br /><br />The religion of the alien presupposes the coming of the \\"alien\\" savior who will banish all human ideology and religion by only their presence. Reason and \\"science\\" will conquer all and the aliens will guide humanity to its rightful place as gods. Strength is the ultimate morality and what is to be worshipped. The unworthy, clinging to the failed past, will attempt to kill the alien savior but will fail.<br /><br />David S. Goyer takes it a step further by grafting a sort of philosophical darwinism on the top of. A philosophical darwinism where there are \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\". There are those who follow the path upward and there are who do not. Those who do not follow the path upward don't simply make themselves extinct, but must (apparently) be made extinct by their betters.<br /><br />Krypton deserved extinction for turning its back on genetic evolution as well as the battle for Lebensraum out in the universe. But under the careful protection of Superman, that mistake will not be made on Earth.<br /><br />The is an odd basis for a superman film. But this is where we are in 2013.<br /><br />The film starts out with a dying planet (Krypton) which is dying seemingly for turning its back on progress, expansion and genetic evolution. The politicians do nothing. The military tries to preserve the status quo. But the father of little superman seems to see their destruction as a moral judgement. They must all die so that the path upward can begin again but only through HIS son of course. No small irony in Jor-El attacking Zod over choosing bloodlines when he decides that only HIS son should survive.<br /><br />Young superman comes to earth. Then the survivors of his people come after him. After a whole lot of pointless overly destructive fighting, Superman makes an active decision to carry out the genocide of his own people. The film doesn't dwell on the awful moral nature of that decision or the questionable reasoning behind it. Humanity will be led forward by its new shephard and the fate of those not moving forward is to be made extinct. Though each side has what the other needs, there can be no negotiation or second thoughts. Its a pure darwinian struggle between those who will survive and those who will be made extinct.<br /><br />The film then degenerates into a pointless excess of destructive violence. The excess makes it all very uninteresting. Its a very boring fight that ends in a very predictable way. Superman fights without a second thought to the consequences of his actions. He destroys his home town. He destroys the city center of Metropolis. He never even makes an attempt to take the fighting away from places where many, many people will die. If someone in front of him is to be killed, it somehow matters. But the deaths of thousands of people who can't be seen in front of him are not worth a second thought.<br /><br />The film could have been rather emotional had Zod actually made the accusation of Genocide and talked of bringing Superman to justice before their final fight. But the film always repairs its moral shortcomings by making Zod irrationally homicidal toward humans. Even when he supposed to be angry beyond words at Superman, killing a few humans always seems the higher priority.<br /><br />In terms of disguisting ideas, the only thing I can compare it to is \\"300\\" which is not exactly ironic considering that they share the same director. Oddly enough, many of ideas are also a \\"blowing up\\" of the ideas of the Dark Knight from the scale of a city to the scale of a world: the lone orphan sacrificing himself to become a sort of civilizational avatar. The overtly fascist undercurrent in all these ideas is somewhat disturbing.<br /><br />Michael Shannon gives by far the best performance in the film. He escapes from the shadow of Terence Stamp and makes the character his own. Kevin Costner plays his predictable character actor role. Russell Crowe appears to have prepared by watching Star Wars Films.<br /><br />Henry Cavill looks the part but is given almost nothing to do as an actor. I cant think of a single memorable scene with him. Laurence Fishburne was trying to be Ed Bradley rather than do a fictional character role and is in far too many scenes in which he was not needed.<br /><br />Its not a bad film technically. But its philosophy is horrible and the whole urban alien invasion thing has been done to death in films. Raising the level of action up didn't make it seem any more fresh.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|I would reccommend this movie to everyone my 4 and 3 year old granddaughters love it.<br />Very entertaining clean fun
B002ZG976U|5.0|If you like musicals, this one is great!  Christina Aguilera's acting isn't so hot, but her voice more than makes up for it!  Cher is amazing in both the acting and singing (as usual!) and the supporting cast and dancers are awesome!  The story line and the music is something fresh and different.  If you like Cher and Christina, you'll love this movie!
B002BWP4A6|5.0|'White Ribbon' postulates an answer to a hitherto largely unasked question of \\"elephant in the room\\" proportions: is the pathology of right wing extremism, Germany's Nazis in this case, the result of environment or of some innate type of psychopathological defect?  Is it Nazi nurture or Nazi nature?  If nature, is it due to an \\"anti-nature\\", the possession by some sort of primal malevolent spirit, such as proposed by the great and too seldom seen movie \\"Fast Runner\\" (enthusiastically endorsed by the late Siskel and Ebert)?<br /><br />In 'White Ribbon', 'Something Evil This Way Comes' came early in the 20th Century to an unsuspecting Germany.  Future Nazis demonstrate their spiritual sickness and psychopathology as children in a series of vile acts; acts that pass the boundary between over-zealous juvenile delinquency and wanton \\"depraved mind\\" criminality.  Parents troubled by their children's horrible behavior and lack of empathy precede a world later stunned by that same defect, a defect of soul and psyche that ultimately manifested itself in a global crime spree of a magnitude never seen before or since.<br /><br />'White Ribbon' is not only an entertaining and well-made movie, but also an essential and unique historical proposition in the sense that it prods its viewers to consider a possible explanation for an otherwise inexplicable evil.
140120841X|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone especially if you enjoyed the movie. Great story about revolution and making a change.

B007MDB71O|5.0|John Carter is based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs Classic Sci Fi Novel \\"The Princess of Mars\\". It is an action packed tale of a Virginia Cavalryman from the Post Civil War Era in American History that though a twist of fate finds himself fighting for the independence of a great city state called Helium on the planet Mars. He finds his phsical abilities to be greatly enhanced due to the lower gravity of Mars. He is captured, fights free, wins friends and finds a woman and a cause worth fighting for again. This is a great movie.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Here's my summary: (spoilers)<br />In a world where certain people are \\"graced\\" with certain super powers-ranging from something useful like  mind reading, to something less useful, like swimming well- a girl named katsa is graced with killing. Her uncle the king-one of the seven kings(there's queens too)- sends her on missions to torchure/kill people that have disobeyed him.<br />----<br />This is a great fantasy book. I recommend that you read this book before Fire or Bitterblue.<br />Also, my summary may not be the best, but this book is not all about katsa and her uncle sending her on missions. It takes a twist and a turn (spoiler) and suddenly katsa is rethinking what her grace REALLY is.....<br />Read this book!
0307730700|5.0|After reading Eric Blehm's \\"Fearless\\",  I came away again thoroughly impressed with the dedication and tenacity of the men and women of our Armed Forces.  There are certainly a lot of books written by and about the service men and women in our recent Middle Eastern wars, many of which are written from a first-person perspective -- \\"Lone Survivor\\" and \\"American Sniper\\" being also among some of the best in the genre.  However \\"Fearless\\" is quite unique in that the protagonist was killed in action, and the author re-creates his path through interviews and snippets from his life.  It is an excellent book about redemption and faith, in that Adam Brown (the subject of the book) did not always lead such an exemplary life until the time when he entered into the US Navy.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone seeking a story of true hope and character regardless of the obstacles.  It is a story of the support of others in times of trial, the strength to lift one's self out of life's miseries with the help of God and the love of country and fellow servicemen in both peace and war.  And while we know the outcome of Adam Brown's life, we can't help but be incredibly thankful for these amazing men and women who are willing to give everything for our American ideal.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah's Blogging for Books program in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.

B00CMB8MXC|1.0|We had high hopes for this sequel soundtrack because we loved the original one so much. This sequel soundtrack has duplicate songs from the original plus some terrible songs by the minions. The minion march song from the original soundtrack is good, but the minion songs on this sequel soundtrack are like nails on a chalk board. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this one.
034580404X|5.0|I HAVE VERY MUCH ENJOYED READING THE FIRST BOOK, AM NOW ABOUT HALF WAY THRU THE 2ND.  THE BOOKS ARE VERY ACCURATELY DESCRIBED ONLINE AND MAY NOT BE EVERY READERS SUBJECT OF CHOICE BUT, I'D HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE BOOKS I JUST HAD TO GET A SET. AND READ THEM FOR MYSELF.. IT'S HARD TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN ONCE YOU START READING!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|very entertaining for what it is. It's an interesting idea about zombies. It's a little corny but the storyline was great and there was never a dull moment.
B005HEVBGG|3.0|Voyager was my favorite of the Star Trek series.<br />I was really excited in find out I'll be able to enjoy all of the seasons with my Prime account.<br /><br />Of the 16 sessions I've watched so far I've had problems with half.<br /><br />The first problem was something wrong with Adobe Flash Player, I had to get tech help with this.<br /><br />Next came the program of reloading at some point in the viewing. I either had to restart the session or completely get out of brower.<br /><br />Once when I reloaded the session I got an error message saying the program could not be opened because it was already open.<br /><br />So far I've been able to get the session to restart but its a pain to have to keep doing it!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|My father gave me this book when I was a young girl and told me to read it.  I tried to read it several times and it was difficult to understand.  Then when I got a little older, I tried again and couldn't put it down!  It's the most profound love story.  I read it almost every year and enjoy it each time as though it was my first.  I never tire of it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The book was so descriptive of life in Afghanistan. Showed the common problems of life anyone can relate to as well as circumstances of characters' lives.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The best graphics out of a lot of games I have tried on  my kindle. Easy to play and fun as well. I recommend this one to anyone who wants a cool game on their device.
0547258305|2.0|[Contains spoilers] Decent, but a far weaker fantasy novel than I expected. This book had its ups-and-downs. The romance aspect, though believable in its own right, was my least favorite part of the book. To be fair, I should have expected that given the reviews and the book's \\"girl meets guy and everything changes\\" plot hook, but their romance was the main thing throughout the novel. And Katsa's not just in love with any guy--oh no--it's a PRINCE. Of course.<br /><br />The main character also varied between likable and unlikable for me. Katsa, already cursed with Special Snowflake Syndrome, is very obtuse for a majority of the book, which was annoying but easy enough to forgive. Most main characters suffer SSS after all. (It's also ridiculous for me that her name is Katsa, and the author's name is Kristen Cashore haha. Someone should introduce these two to Cassandra Clare and her protagonist Clary.) Thank goodness this book was not written in first person, trapping me deep in Katsa's head for 300 pages, or I would have quit after a few chapters of \\"woe is me.\\"<br /><br />Katsa does have a good deal of dignity and justice, which I liked. Ultimately, the reader will side with her against the obstacles she faces. However, until she meets Princess Bitterblue, she has a tendency to avoid, look down on, and/or pity all other women. Other than Hilda, whom she seemed to tolerate rather than like, she has no female acquaintances or friends. While Katsa makes up for this at the end of the book by deciding to teach girls how to fight, her view and treatment of women truly bothered me. I get that some of that demonstrates Katsa's character flaws; due to her upbringing, which isn't her fault, she's not good at reading people and doesn't like to make friends in general. But it's tough for me to call this a feminist book when the FMC views other women as alien rather than human. That's not what feminism is. Cashore does better at introducing other women as actual people in the 2nd half of the book, and by the end Katsa is able to overcome some of her issues and relate to women (as well as men).<br /><br />Good stuff: there are lots of interesting elements in this book! Cashore's got a good world-building foundation, filled with varied cultures and landscapes. There was just enough action to keep me entertained in the first half, and the last half of the book has plenty of suspense as well, once Katsa and Po find Bitterblue. My favorite section of the book was when Katsa and Bitterblue survived the winter mountains on their own, second only to the chapter where she killed King Leck. (Some readers might not like a book where the villains are one-dimensional, but I don't care as long as they're a real threat.) The politics were fascinating, and its \\"magic\\" system in the form of people born with Graces had so many possibilities that I wish Cashore had explored this a bit more. Okay, a lot more.<br /><br />I would be hesitant to recommend this to others as a \\"good fantasy book you should read.\\" The author invested more heavily in her themes and relationships than in her world-building, which is not good because it's not like her themes are saying anything new. Marriage isn't for everyone? What a surprise! Hell, if it wasn't for the Graces, you could have easily set this story in a completely different setting (maybe even the real world), and that's what separates weak fantasy novels from strong ones. Its re-read value for me is pretty low, too, which speaks a lot to a book's lasting quality for me, whether it's fantasy or not.

B002X9W50E|5.0|I never knew this CD existed until I was looking on Amazon in the<br />Bowie section, so I took a chance and ordered it.  No stab in the dark here, it's perfectly done.  It's nice to hear Bowie s earlier and newer songs live on CD.  If you're a Bowie fan you just can't go wrong with this one, Nice package to add to your Bowie collection for sure.  I can't name a &#34;best&#34; track as the whole selection is totally SWEET.  If you're a novice Bowie fan, this is a nice way to start into his live hits from all of his various eras.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Sometimes it wouldn't work. I like it because it has many things to down load and if you already down load it , it would be easier to open it up Internet or no Internet.

B0053FANS6|5.0|I purchased this series to get the best picture and sound to replace my DVD copies. All three movies are full of action, but some people may have a problem with the third movie's relation to China. My recommendation is to just go with it since it was so entertaining for us.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|Emma Stone's creates a relatable character in this comedy about those lies we all told in High School to make ourselves seem &#34;cooler.&#34; It's a great comedy, but it also serves as a sort of unofficial expos&eacute; on High School culture and the slut shaming we see in society. Highly recommended.<br /><br />PS -<br />If you enjoyed movies such as Mean Girls or Saved!, then you will likely enjoy this film.
B00005N6KG|2.0|They sound okay and are waterproof, but the cord is too short.  It barely reaches an MP3 player clipped to my pocket and I am only 5'8\\".  Because the cord is stretched tight, there is no loop at the bottom for the sweat to drip off of and it goes right into the player.  It has now shorted out two MP3 players (one I have had for years and the latest one for less than a week).  I can no longer use them for running.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like this very much.  I don't have problems sleeping but when I use this its a different kind of sleep.  It seems deeper to me.  You can mix your own favorites. I recommend it and its sister products free at the app store
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the graphics. Without the clues, the game would take longer to get through the boards. After I completed, both my kids got into The Room. Can't wait for the next level to be updated.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|The film is beautifully filmed, and the quiet moments between the characters tend to be the more powerful moments. There is ample (and, for the most part, believable) character development seen in most of the characters, and the child actors are marvelous, particularly Kate Maberly, who plays Mary -- the film's protagonist.<br /><br />Lovely film, overall.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I would not see this movie again! There were too many simultaneous stories, and I could not figure out the plot. I think this movie had great visual effects, but missed the basic idea of solidifying a plot. I would not even rent this movie to see it!

B00AOMR2S2|3.0|I love the music to this movie, and that the cast members are actually singing the songs. I just feel a little ripped off that the songs are not full length. Most soundtracks play the entire song, even if it was only sampled in the movie.

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|While the casting for this movie was odd (Franco did a fine job but I can't help but feel Johnny Depp would've been better) my wife, daughter, and I really enjoyed this whimsical and nostalgic re-imagining of the classic Oz.  Special effects were of course fantastic as were the sets and costumes.  It really felt like the land of Oz and Sam Raimi did his usual great job in bringing humor and light-heartedness to the story.  The story definitely had a great message and was entertaining throughout.  One minor drawback was Mila Kunis once she became evil.  She just came off as a bit cartoony and wasn't really scary enough in my opinion.  Still the plot was fluid and kept you moving at a good pace.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone looking for a fun and enjoyable flick to watch with the family!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Literally could not stop, just loved trying to figure out what was needed to unlock the next room.  Not too easy and challenging enough to keep me looking for the next clue.  Need more rooms!!

B00DD49R0E|4.0|Didja love The Minions last time? I know I did! So I'm happy to report those little yellow fireplugs are back...in FORCE! It is clear that the filmmakers knew how much the children loved them; AND like last time, they saved their best 3D effects for the final credits, so I $ugge$t you $kip tho$e extra charge$ unless you already have your 3D DVD player from Amazon.<br /><br />Our hero is asked to come out of retirement to help find a villain who can inject the sweetest creature with a serum that turns it into an indestructible force for Evil. Gru would rather stay home and host a birthday party for one of his beloved daughters, so he turns down the job.<br /><br />In this PG family outing:<br />  * Steve Carell (\\"Hope Springs\\") returns as Gru, our favorite villain-turned-marshmallow, the fellow who adopted three little girls under false pretenses in the first Despicable Me, then learned how to read bedtime stories and become a really good father.<br />  * Kristen Wiig (\\"Bridesmaids\\") is Lucy, our hero's sidekick, a pretty tough cookie who obviously has a \\"thing\\" for him.<br />  * Benjamin Bratt (\\"Snitch\\") is Eduardo/El Macho, the proprietor of a Mexican-food place in the mall.<br />  * Moises Arias (\\"The Kings of Summer\\") is Antonio, the muy guapo heartthrob who sweeps Gru's dazzled daughter Margo off her feet.<br />  * Miranda Cosgrove (\\"Despicable Me\\") is Margo, the oldest of Gru's three girls, just entering her hormonal years...to her father's dismay.<br />  * Russell Brand (\\"Rock of Ages\\") is Gru's assistant Dr. Nefario, who leaves his employment for a better deal.<br /><br />At the theatrical screening this week, I enjoyed the children's giggles of delight with The Minions and I appreciated the well-balanced parenting I saw from Gru. (Those are the nicest little girls!) In addition, it always pleases me to see some professional voice artists used in these projects, so kudos to the casting folks! The grandparents in my JayFlix.net group will love showing this oneto the little 'uns.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I devoured this book.  From the very first page, I was interested in these characters and the story that connected them.  I found it to be a very intriguing plot with an even more impressive format.  Reading two people's perspectives about the same events simultaneously really enhanced the story.  Even though you know the outcome of the tale from the very beginning of the book, the author still made you want to find out every detail that led to that conclusion.

I first heard about the book in the magazine Book Marks and on Books on the Nightstand's podcast.<br /><br />First Line: I listened to this one, but here is the first line...\\"At one end of my desk sits a nearly 400 year-old book cloaked in a tan linen sack and a good deal of mystery.\\"<br /><br />Buy, Borrow, Listen, or Avoid?:  I'd recommend either buy/borrow or listen.  I don't know if I'd have finished the book quite so quickly if I had not been listening.<br />[[ASIN:1594484813 The Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession]]<br /><br />[...]/>[...]
0425252868|5.0|My husband loved this book. He would often read an excerpt to me telling me how much the story was informing him of the untold stories behind WWII. He could not put it down. An easy read, very captivating.<br />If you appreciate history and WWII untold stories of real heroism, buy it!

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games Review?<br /><br />The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins...Wait, I know what you are already thinking...Do I really need to read another review of The Hunger Games? Well, lets talk about what a review really does. A review allows the reader to digest...so to speak...their reading experience. It allows said reader to mull over the key virtues or defects the reader found in the book he or she has just finished.  A review is a personal comment on the reader's personal reading experience. So in essence, by penning a review the reader is allowed to connect with the reading community at large, which doesn't often happen; since reading is usually a solitary activity. So, yes, I do want to offer my personal take on the colossally popular YA novel.<br /><br />The Hunger Games has been sitting in my To Be Read (TBR) pile by my bed, since it first came out. What I'm saying is, I didn't just jump on the bandwagon, because it became this giant hit in 2011/2012. I haven't even seen the movie. Honestly, the dystopian genre has always been a favorite of mine. Science fiction is what I called it back in the day, but now this offshoot of science fiction has emerged with its own characteristics. It is really amazing to watch a whole new genre come to life from the ashes-so to speak-of science fiction. I guess it is important to identify what classifies a book as dystopian. Robinson Wells defines dystopia on his blog as, \\"Utopia with a fatal flaw. Think of all the classic dystopias--1984, Brave New World, The Giver, etc.. These novels all show worlds that attempted to create a perfect society, but that 'perfection' was attained at a horrible cost.\\" (I'll add Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery to this list of past dystopian classics) I like this definition, so lets go with it; since there are dystopianites all over the world debating the \\"real definition\\" of this genre as I press the keys to click out this review.<br /><br />Now for the review...I read the The Hunger Games back in May/June 2012, it jumped to the top of my TBR pile when I was asked to write the English Department's request to add this novel to our seventh grade approved list of \\"teaching novels.\\"  You can't very well write such a document unless you have read the book, but I seem to continue to digress.<br /><br />I read the book and wrote up the request, but I did not write my review.  Before I felt comfortable penning my commentary, I needed some mulling over time.  I now have had several weeks to carefully consider this novel, and here are my thoughts...The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is one of the best dystopian novels, I have read to date.  It has so much to offer.  With that said, I will add that I am going to present my review in a most non-traditional manner.  First, I am going to assume that anyone who is reading this review already knows the basic premise of the book, in other words, I'm skipping the summary part of the review.  Instead, I am going to focus on the themes the novel has to offer in the hopes that YOU, the reader of this review, will make some connections and develop new original thoughts based on the various and sundry themes floating amongst the 374 pages of this dystopian YA novel-and there are many.  Here is what I came up with...<br /><br />Friendship<br /><br />Friendship is seen in many forms throughout the novel:<br />Katniss and Gale<br />Katniss and Peeta<br />Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch<br />Katniss and Cinna<br />Throughout all of these relationships, friendship is revealed to be a crucial factor in the triumph of Katniss.<br /><br />Family and Sacrifice<br /><br />Loyalty and protection of family - Katniss makes the ultimate sacrifice to save her sister by volunteering as a tribute in the games. This is an important theme for young people, as the life of social media, and fragile connections between friends and family is now the norm. Through the lens of the novel, teens will be forced to imagine if they would be braveor valiant enough to stand up and protect family members, and thereby, decide how much personal relationships mean to them. Would they give up their Gameboys, their Internet or Facebook? What about their cell phones? Young people today are so connected with their technology, they often don't think about what is at stake.<br /><br />Survival<br /><br />Survival/Importance of Nature - There are many interesting techniques dealing with surviving in nature on one's own found throughout the novel. Katniss shows the importance of knowing how to stay alive with no technology, or help of any kind. This is important for young adults today because of society's heavy reliance on technology. Through the protagonist, Katniss, teens are forced to imagine life with no technology. Questions such as-How might a modern day teenager communicate, eat, or provide for their families if they lived in the world of The Hunger Games?- can be addressed by the reader of this dystopian novel.<br /><br />Freedom and Oppression<br /><br />Freedom of Speech - The Avox character in The Hunger Games is a distinct representation in our \\"real world\\" of the dangers of losing our Constitutional rights as citizens. These servant characters have had their tongues removed for slanderous remarks, or simply questions pointed to the capital of Panem. The novel allows teens to examine the importance of the Freedom of Speech, and think about what we, as a society, should be doing to protect this right.<br /><br />Materialism<br /><br />Loss of Identity through Fashion - The character of Effie Trinket is a colorful, and fashion driven lady who is \\"always up on the latest fashion\\". She does a wonderful job of showing the reader how far fashion trends can go. She is the bridge to discussion of social classes and the gap between rich and poor. The wider this gap becomes, the more apparent it is to outsiders to be able to identify the rich from the poor. The fashions become a symbol of social status in the world, and something that the rich are unaware they are marketing. A great eye opener for fashion driven teenagers.<br /><br />Class Structure<br /><br />Defining the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\" - Through the novel, teens are forced to compare and contrast the population of the capitol with the population of the districts. Young adults are forced to use critical thinking skills to decide what is important: the relationships of family and friends as shown in the districts, or material goods as in the capitol. Also, the novel allows teenagers to examine the unfair nature of government, as it is portrayed in the novel, as all products are filtered through the walls of the capital, and thereby the reader is allowed to examine what is wrong with the capital's system of government.<br /><br />Media<br /><br />Dangers of the Media - In The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins makes a clear issue of the dangers of reality television, something that our whole society is exposed to on a daily basis. The concept that the reader should be taking away from the novel, is that with little provocation, our society is very quick to forget about the people (tributes) involved in many \\"media challenges\\". As viewers, we disregard the human aspect of television, and focus on entertainment alone. Panem's capitol is representing the future of our culture if reality television keeps going in the direction it is aimed. The novel forces teenagers to make connections by relating the media circus of The Hunger Games to shows like Jersey Shore and Hoarders. Very savvy teenagers will readily see the dangers of using people's problems as entertainment. Mature teenagers will also ask questions, such as, do we see these people as people or characters? In asking these types of questions teenagers will become aware that media has a way of making us forget just who is on the other side of the camera.<br /><br />Identity<br /><br />Loss of Identity through Media - Peeta's struggle to be more \\"than a pawn in the games\\", is a large theme in the novel. His fight to keep his loyalties with Katniss though the games is honorable and is a good example of overcoming peer pressure. The teens will observe the methods that Katniss and Peeta use to overcame the game's influence to become killers, and instead hold fast to their morals, and only do what is necessary to survive. In contrast to other characters, Katniss and Peeta did not abide by the capitol's wish to \\"put on a good show\\" for the viewers of the games. They often use the influence of the media in their favor, as well, in helpful and peaceful ways, as opposed to the violence used by the other characters in the novel.<br /><br />Symbolism<br /><br />The mockingjay pin - The mockingjay pin worn by Katniss in the novel, symbolizes the revolution of the districts. Using the \\"historical context\\" of the pin, which is a jab against the capital (mockingjays were created to spy on the people of the districts, but the districts discovered the birds and used them as a way to feed the capitol false information), becomes something that represents not only the revolution, but hope, freedom, and the ability to change.<br /><br />Historical Context<br /><br />The Hunger Games Arena - The Arena that the tributes fight in is very much influenced by the Roman Era Arena. The whole idea of people having to fight to the death as entertainment for the \\"upper class\\" is parallel to Roman times gladiatorial competitions held in coliseums all over the Roman Empire. This might potentially opens up a teens interest in a historical time period. It can also allow teens to identify elements of the novel that are inspired by history.<br /><br />Whooh!  I have come to the end of my list of themes. I know this is not what you might have been expecting since this is labeled as a review, but do note the question mark in the heading of my review.

B008602KQI|4.0|The book is better, probably because you get more of the back story and understand the motivations better.  The director took some liberties that take the heart out of the plot.  The meaning of the gift of bread from district 4 is essential to understanding how and why the revolution spreads and he skipped it entirely.  the movie just seems like Hunger games lite.  It could have been bolder, bloodier, and more tense.  But if you have not read the book you would probably enjoy it.  Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland were particularly well cast.

B000031EGV|4.0|Never a dull moment in this movie. The animals and plants are great. The monkeys are mischievous and remind me of the creatures in Gremlins. A sequel would be nice but not likely to happen.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and well paced.  Even though the effects seem a bit cheesy (as do some of the lines in the movie) these only add to the comedy of it.  Overall, I suggest it for any get together of friends that are 15 years and older!
B00371XIJE|5.0|Watch a trailer before watching the movie so you know what you know about the tears you will be shedding from this. Great movie with wonderful acting. Brought back wonderful memories of a great pet (Siberian Husky) I had as a kid that was just as loyal. Made my entire family cry with tears of loving memories.

B00CH26TL8|5.0|This is a fun game.The problem is with this game and all the other free games is that they always want you to buy extra coins or extra life.What is the point of FREE when you have to spend money to continue playing?
B008JFUO72|5.0|I'm the first to admit that if you take this stuff seriously, meaning this is a documentary about a real person with a real suit of armor, you'll be disappointed.  No doubt there are changes and even errors compared to the Iron Man rulebook.  On the other hand, if you can take a step back and realize this is a movie that pokes fun at both itself and current events, it's a lot of fun.  A guess would be that the people involved thought a sequel to the sequel wasn't really necessary but if you're going to do it again, why not have some fun with it?<br /><br />After seeing Man of Steel, which was long, somber, predictable, expensive and really kind of dull, I wasn't expecting a lot from Iron Man.  But I think a comparison is appropriate.  Both these movies cost millions and have state of the art effects.  Iron Man has some wonderful, funny exchanges between Tony Stark and the little kid (nothing like that in Superman) and of course the hilarious Mandarin who deserves a movie of his own.  Whereas Russell Crowe is wasted on corny Krypto-dialog and Diane Lane is hardly in Superman, in Iron Man, Ben Kingsley creates a new, totally incongruous character that people will remember even if they didn't like the movie.<br /><br />Now, what typically happens is, you have to choose between interesting characters and plot or tons and tons and tons of action.  But Iron Man 3 has both.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love the pink haven't used it as much as I want but it's cool to read a book on it. Still getting uesd to it son said he would have it if it wasn't pink. Told him I have my reasons for the pink one LOL
014241039X|5.0|Roald Dahl's books are timeless and this is no exception.  This is a great book for a kid that loves to read or a great choice to encourage your child to read.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|A brief/quick and engaging history of Islam and of the Crusades.  Worthwhile read for people just beginning their education about many current conflicts around the globe.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Everyone loves Tarantino, myself included, but this movie goes on a bit and was predictable. My girlfriend felt the same way.
B004UFEJW6|4.0|A non typical Kurt Russell film that has a good storyline and lots of explosions...Not his typical comedy type of film at all
0812983459|5.0|This debut novel is a signal to watch out for this writer:  Rachel Joyce.  She tells a story with great conviction.
0312430000|5.0|Let me make this clear up front -- I would read just about anything Atul Gawande writes. He's simply a terrific writer and storyteller.<br /><br />As you can tell from the title, this book is about checklists (not simple \\"to do\\" lists). He talks about how in the medical field, the amount of knowledge we have gained far surpasses the ability for one individual (such as a surgeon), or even a team of people, to fully comprehend.<br /><br />He begins with the history of checklists in aviation, and then talks about checklist systems used in building. I think we take for granted how safe, reliable and efficient the processes of flying airplanes and constructing buildings has become. It's apparent that checklists are front and center in their success.<br /><br />This book is useful for anyone who works in a field that is complex. It has excellent examples of checklists in the financial services (investment) field, as well as the aforementioned aviation, building and medicine fields. He introduced a checklist via WHO funding and saw dramatic improvements in the surgical field. In short, it's a no-brainer to introduce checklists in a variety of different endeavors. If you don't believe me, read the book! After all, it's an easy, short read and only took me a few hours to finish.<br /><br />I was interested in this book because of my own experiences with checklists. When I worked with a group of contracts professionals, I pushed my boss to establish a standard checklist for the contracts folks. He agreed and we went ahead and put together a fairly comprehensive but easy to use checklist, with the help of various other disciplines. Unfortunately, my boss was unceremoniously fired just as we were to present the checklist to management for approval and insertion into standard company processes. And much to my chagrin, the checklist basically died in utero as successive people didn't deem it important. Another funny aspect of this process was how most of the contracts people -- most of whom were in desperate need of assistance with their work, as it was sloppy, uninspired and far from standardized -- reacted. Just like the surgeons in Gawande's book. They viewed it not as a tool to help them manage the highly complex job they have and reduce errors, but as an affront to their skill set, experience and ego. This reaction shocked me, as I always felt that I'd love to have a checklist in every aspect of my job. Unfortunately, my area of the legal field (IP) isn't necessarily checklist friendly all the time, although this book has inspired me to make the attempt.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, along with most of the other books Gawande has written.<br /><br />9/10
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We liked watching this 3D version of AVATAR BETTER THAN WATCHING IT IN THE THEATER. The picture has incredible clarity and depth and scenes just flow off the screen. Would highly recommend to people who like sci fi.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|This is a good follow up for Believe.  I thought that the songs kept the feeling the same and helped expand an already great concert experience.
B007V65R54|3.0|I love Nate Silver, so I was really looking forward to this book, but I felt like there was not much in here to spark my interest.  This reads similarly to other books in this genre, and didn't really provide anything unique for me to consider.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|its a lot better than the other ones alltho I'm only a hammerhead But is awesome so the game is a real record breaker compared to other shark games.
0767903862|5.0|I love this book. I read A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson and well so thought I would try this one and it's fantastic. I know so much about Australia now and even want to visit! There are hilarious snippets and quotes threaded throughout the book for a fantastic read.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|It is still a great game. OpenFeint was removed sometime last year, so ignore the posts that bash the app for having data mining schemes.
B00785P2QC|3.0|great for when your bored, but the energy concept allows limited action over a long period of time. if you could do more and play for 5 minutes at a time, then the game would be great
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I made a plague called Facebook. When it wiped out earth I died laughing. I recommend this game to everybody.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This album is a disgrace to rap.  And the worst part about it, Kanye is 100% convinced he is a genius creative artist.  Do yourself a huge favor: save your mind some agony and preserve your IQ level by not buying this album.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have DVD already, buy you won't wanna miss blue-ray.<br />The best show I've watched. I watched  at least 50 times. lol
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Very irreverent, dirty, twisted puppetry - it was great!  Not for kids, but if you like South Park, you should love it,.
B000XXTCF8|4.0|Even when you find a greatest hits album, there is usually at least one song on the album that you don't really like.  Not true with this album.  Just good music by Van Morrison.  If you like Van Morrison, you like this album.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another lovely mix of fact and fiction where fact trumps fiction in the usual exciting Rollins fashion:) Couldn't put it down!
B001IFZL50|5.0|it's a good show so I bot blue ray though I have DVD already.<br />different view of war, worth to have it.
0439813786|5.0|Now THIS is a graphic novel!  My son loves graphic novels and he is an avid reader.  This book is truly remarkable. It was recommended to him by a teacher and it has become a favorite.  It rarely sees the shelf because either he is reading it or has loaned it to a friend.  It is such a great find!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun challenge to get  to next rooms finding random items and clues. Not too hard but  challenges your brain.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|This is one of my favorite books.  I wondered how they would condense it down into a movie.  I guess I was disappointed because so much had to be cut and the ending was not what I expected.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm stuck on level six with the pyrimid of numbers after you read this leave a answers for me firing to know
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I recently joined a book club and this is our first book. I had seen Sheryl Sandberg's TED Talk a few years ago so was excited to read this book and get more of her perspective on women's issues. I recommend this book to all women; whether working full-time, being a stay at home mom, or somewhere in between. Being a new mom myself, I struggled when deciding whether to return to work or stay at home with my baby full time. After reading this book, I feel empowered to be able  to manage my career and my family life and hope that after reading this book more women feel empowered to lean in to whatever their life's passion may be.
B00BUT5I84|2.0|What happened to the 30 Seconds To Mars I knew and loved? This sounds mostly like Jared Leto trying not to fall asleep while everyone taps a few keys on a keyboard. I just don't know how a band that made such a unique and lively album such as The Kill and their self-titled album can keep us in suspense since This Is War and give us this? I forced myself to listen through it 5-ish times (some songs I skipped as they were boring instrumentals) and none of it sticks with me except their two singles, Up In The Air and Conquistador. Their poster is on my wall, picture in a picture frame, and their logo is on my keychain and was on my computer. I love this band and I'm so insanely disappointed at this album. 2/5 stars :(
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cool game fun to play build build and keep on building can't stop building and playing. Good no great way to pass some time
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It wasn't as great as owning a horse of your own, but it was pretty realistic. Totally worth it to get it.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|(By the way, this is Julie's husband, I'm the person buying the movies  :-) ) It has all the right ingredients, action, action, action. Not for the kiddies but it sure as heck was fun to watch; of course I am a fan of Gemma Arterton so what's not to like? I figured out the sub plot about a third of the way through the movie and I must admit, I really like it. It is definitely an adult version of the fairy tale, really not appropriate for the kiddies. Another \\"by the way\\", I really don't care what critics say, I'll decide for myself, thank you.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've owned magic cards for 20 years. Really got into magic during Mirrodon block. This is by far the most fun electronic version you can play. MOTG just feels like the games don't matter and people concede at the beginning of games. This just feels like magic. I'm very pleased. If you are a fan of magic get this. You also get a code for an actual real promo card!

B0071BGOJC|4.0|I did not enjoy it as much as previous book, found it dragged and has taken me months to finish.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is better than a love story.  I loved the first two books and this is turning out to be a great addition.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Started slow but then the story builds on to a very well written story. I will now have to read the rest of his stories
B0095P31L6|5.0|I found myself watching this with two other adults  on a nine inch kindle screen.....laughing.....while eating popcorn...and no kids!  It was a funny movie and entertaining.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|The real Queensrÿche is back with a very killer album.  Finally a worthy follow up to Promised Land. The Geoff Tate solo era has finally come to an end. Goosebumps.  Thanks guys!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Was expecting it to be the final book...felt like there was a lot of rambling. Don't know if I'll read the next one.
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|This is an excellent documentary with the latest fossil findings that includes some the most recent dinosaurs found in Asia.  This documentary is very well thought out, detailed, educational, and outstanding facts.  I would recommend this documentary to any dinosaur enthusiast as well as aspiring paleontologists.
B00DGQF0K0|3.0|I had the other one but that was confused and it was hard but this one is 99 cents. and its just like the other one
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Customer Service is really great.  I needed a little info to move forward -------and their  reply was<br />Quick and  very helpful.  This customer attention  matches the games that are so well created.<br />Thanks!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a great puzzle game.  Age appropriate for all who love to work out their brain.  The graphics are very nice on my kindle fire.
B000YDAYCW|5.0|I'm usually a 9 and ended up with an 8. Besides that, the boots are GREAT!. No break in necessary, they feel great and look very nice with jeans. As always, excellent experience buying at Amazon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was wary of this app due to the sheer difficulity of these types of games. however the puzzles in this app are challanging but not rage inducing. 5 stars.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|all the single ladies all the single ladies all the single ladies oh oh oh, if you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|A few months before I bought a Swann DVR/camera system I checked for the FREE Swannview app through Kindle apps and found it.  Now after purchasing the Swann unit the app is deleted and Amazon redirects you to this $4 app.  Now I have to try installing from Google Play, what a nuisance!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Alas I have a basic Kindle and cannot install Swann's app from Google.  If you have a Kindle Fire you can do a round-a-bout install.  Just look around, there are often free apps out there for your DVR - Amazon seems to be leaving some out.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|The book was entertaining, but not great literature. A good way to pass an afternoon, but nothing to make your life better
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is great at forcing my old brain to recharge...an excellent problem solver which forces the user to look for openings which are far less than obvious.  The quell games are awesome.
B009T3AHDE|5.0|A good David Cronenberg film is never something easy to watch, it's never something shallow or even likeable.  Cronenberg's filming style has always been about strangeness and perplexity, the portrayal of his characters' own strangeness and perplexity.  There's not much humor in them, they speak in epigrams, often dark ones, and come in and out of the film in a very enigmatic way.    However, the progression of the film is totally cerebral and quite complex.  It's claustrophobic too although this does not come from the closed spaces in which the story unwraps but from a deeper and more obscure anguish, one that can not be traced and is consequently expressed in a labyrinthine and disconcerting way, same as de Lillo's book and faithful to Cronenberg's own filming style.    Cosmopolis gives the Canadian director the chance to connect his more recent themes such as corporate politics, how the past shapes the present and the origin of violence with his older and more strange themes like the mechanization of the conscience, the correlation between technology and the body and the link between biology and power.  All of these topics and many more are present in the film, and these are exactly the themes that have placed David Cronenberg as one of the most original directors among contemporary filmmakers.    Pattison delivers a fine performance far removed from the ones he's done in more commercial and often stupid films.  Let's hope it does not take so long before he's able to shake off the s***ty Twilight stigma.    Cosmopolis is a towering achievement, another one in Cronenberg's gigantic and marvelous filmography, a real treasure... but only for those who think.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a great game for people who love puzzles. It is easy enough to complete the stages on the first try, but much harder to complete them in the minimal amount of moves.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Is either an incredibly intelligent movie or the most anticipated piece of elephant dung. Take your pick. I want my money back. Worth buying only for the references to HR Giger.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I really enjoy this game!!!!!! I have only had one problem when I was on level 13 I exited the game and when I came back a few minutes later it started me all over.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I love dragons and downloaded this game. The first thing I noticed when I ran out of room was that 1. It took a lot of coins to expand 2. When you expanded it took even MORE coins to clear the stuff. I felt with it and got up to the level where you can get the light dragon. My kindle totally freaked out and my OTHER apps stopped working! I deleted the app and things went back to normal. Buy Dragonvale instead, it is WAY better.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game that does not require internet to play. My kids like it too. Nice game to play if you have some time to kill. You can play in several different ways including tournament and free play if you buy full version. You get your money's worth.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I bought this as a fathers day gift for my husband and one for my dad. they were a great hit. both loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app you get to pick your minions and defeat Victor and I just love this app I would suggest it
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I've only played a couple of Gameloft games and this one for me is my personal favorite.Pretty decent time to download, nice graphics, smooth animation, and overall a great game. There are some cons though, sometimes when I open the game it doesn't load and it just stay on the title screen and I can't press the home key on my kindle. In fact, the only way for me to continue using my frozen kindle is I have to shut it down and wait for it to start up again. It doesn't happen all the time though it just happened to me twice. Love this game though I play it every day. You should download it you won't regret it I'm sure of it. ;)
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Every mode on this app is easy to use.  I have tried others on friend's tablets.  Once I showed them this one, they also added this app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is rather entertaining. I enjoy playing it while working g overnights its not complicated but gets annoying that have to wait so long to keep going...
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It was so funny I was on the edge of my seat  laughing jeff did it again  make #8 please
B005S9EJ46|5.0|By the time I chose to watch it, it did not work.  And I was outside the return time.  Very upset that I paid for something that was defective and now I can not exchange it for a replacement that does work properly.
