B00006LLJ4|4.0|If you could see the future, could you prevent it from happening? Or would events somehow conspire to make it come true?<br /><br />That's the question -- never quite answered -- that lies at the heart of \\"Minority Report,\\" a tightly-plotted, well-acted sci-fi movie that dabbles in chronophilosophy when it isn't bouncing through intertwined murder mysteries. Steven Spielberg's direction is tight and dramatic, the actors all do excellent jobs, and the one downside is the lackluster fight scenes.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant future (next Sunday A.D.), murder is no longer a problem in the Washington DC area. The PreCrime Unit uses three \\"precogs\\" to predict where and when a murder will happen, and apprehend the murderers before they have a chance to kill.<br /><br />Ever since his son was kidnapped, Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has thrown himself into his PreCrime work. His faith in it is absolute, even when the justice of it is questioned by a clever young auditer, Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). But then one of the precogs sees a vision of Anderton committing a crime: in 36 hours, he will shoot a man he has never even met before.<br /><br />Like anyone else, Anderton immediately goes on the run, hoping that there is some way that the precogs could be mistaken about what will happen. His former partners and coworkers are all trying to hunt him down before he kills, but they aren't able to keep him from kidnapping the precog Agatha (Samantha Morton). Is Anderton doomed to his fate, or is the future not what PreCrime thinks it is? And who has set him up?<br /><br />You can't really have a story about knowing the future without delving into the whole \\"free will vs. determinism\\" debate -- are we masters of our own fate, or will the future unfold as it was foretold? While it only lightly touches on the debate itself, \\"Minority Report\\" hinges entirely on those questions -- and while obviously it can't answer them entirely, it wraps the story in twists and double-twists that swing it both ways.<br /><br />Spielberg's direction is tight, sleek and fast-moving, and he tosses in casually cruel touches (the eye-scanning spiders) that show the lack of real justice in PreCrime's world. He also shows that he's pretty amazing at making a murder mystery, twisting together some seemingly unconnected murders with a truly plausible precog-related motive. Everything makes sense by the end.<br /><br />The movie's biggest problem is that the action scenes just aren't that good. The most ludicrous one is Cruise and Farrell fistfighting in a car factory as giant deadly robot arms assemble a car AROUND CRUISE, followed by Cruise simply driving out of the building. Yeah, that won't need fuel or anything.<br /><br />As for Cruise, he's pretty good here. He's playing the same character he usually plays -- a pure-hearted yet tormented man fighting against the Big Bad System, and his flaws (addiction to a drug I didn't really understand) don't detract from his heroism.<br /><br />Honestly, I was more intrigued by Colin Farrell's subtle performance as Danny Witwer -- a quiet, religious, intense man whose sense of justice is needled by the existence of PreCrime, and whose hunt for Anderton makes him realize that there's more going on here.. And there's a ring of other excellent performances -- Samantha Morton's ethereal Agatha, Max von Sydow, Neal McDonough, and the wildly underused Kathryn Morris as Anderton's estranged wife.<br /><br />\\"Minority Report\\" is a solid, sleek action movie draped in a mantle of philosophical ponderings, and only the clumsy action sequences bog it down. Even if you're not a fan of Cruise, this movie should be seen.ists that swing it both ways.<br /><br />Spielberg's direction is tight, sleek and fast-moving, and he tosses in casually cruel touches (the eye-scanning spiders) that show the lack of real justice in PreCrime's world.

B0091V6TJ0|5.0|I've grown a little leery of the various recordings of \\"lost music\\" and \\"new albums\\" by the artists from back in the day. New albums by Zappa, Hendrix and others turn out to be collections of inferior takes or the same old material shuffled and repackaged for maximum profit. I wonder what Frank would think.<br />  Can's Lost Tapes\\" is a different kind of produce. Since I like reviews to be short, concise and (hopefully) helpful, this is what you should know:<br />  This is a musical statement by an innovative and accomplished band in their prime. It really took me back. And forward as Can will do sometimes. The sound is above average. There is debut material and a few quality live versions of old material heard here for the first time. This album is a sonic gem and should not be missed. It also helped to solidify, for me, the idea that the sons and daughters of all the people who bought Tago Mago back in the day went on to start their own neo-psychedelic band today. Though it was canned forty years ago it is still that fresh.<br />  Enjoy with your preferred garnish.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am not much of a game player but I got the angry birds game original on my phone and found I would play it from time to time.  I am not a Star Wars fanatic; however I do enjoy the movies and lean toward action and SyFy in most cases.  There are so many little nuaces in this game that really make it very fun.  For several nights I would play this non stop for an hour or so.  The charcters they have made into birds are really fun and interesting how they have chosen to portray them and what 'powers' to give them.  I really like they provide the different worlds to play, tattooine, death star, Hoth.  After you have beaten so many levels they even give you little snipits from the movies angry birds style.  I find those very entertaining and cute.  I have found for the most part I can get 3 stars on each of the levels with some effort, so it is challenging but not impossible.  I get a sense of accomlishment but also had to work at it to get there.  There are also bonus games you get after so many points, little golden eggs (extra games) hidden for you to get as well.  You also get to play with the millenium falcon (this is very fun) with so many points earned.  I will also mention that I really like is there are images of the dark side (stormtroopers for example) on the entry screen you can 'blow up' by hitting them with your finger on the screen.  That is outside of the angry bird games (on the main selection screens).  That has been fun when I just can't get the the 3 stars and I want to get out some frustration.  Love the sounds and music as well.  This is really a fun game and well worth the little you pay (I have a kindle HD).  One note: to get into one of the worlds you must hit 3 stars on each of the other world levels - this is a lot of time or you can pay 1.99 to unlock it.  I am going to try for the 3 stars because there is so much else to do in the game but you do have that option if you want.  There are 3 other worlds to play plus the bonus games without that 4th world so if you are patient you will be fine without paying the extra.at 4th world so if you are patient you will be fine without paying the extra.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great discussion book for a book club. Several themes to discuss. I will be pondering this book for awhile. At the moment I'm speechless.
0307271757|5.0|I love A Christmas Carol, and collect all versions of the book.  This was a lovely copy, and it has very nice illustrations.  A very beautiful book!
0547848412|5.0|I purchased the book because I saw the movie. The wonderous adventure of mind and soul are represented beautifully. It reads very easily.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This was a great show and I was glad to purchase the entire series.  Comes in a cute case with some extras - two booklets - including where some of their phrases originate.  My only complaint is that each DVD only shows a couple programs each, so I find myself constantly having to get up and change the disc.
0345803485|1.0|Seriously...don't buy this.  If you have to read it, get it from a library.  It is a poorly written beginners guide to BDSM, the characters have little to no substance, and you can find better \\"scenes\\" in Jacqueline Carey or even Yasmine Galenorn.  This book is not worth the hype!  If you want to learn about \\"the lifestyle\\" the internet is a better place to learn about contracts and such.

0307341550|5.0|I wanted to read Gillian Flynn since her book GONE GIRL has been on top seller list for so long; and even though these are not in a series I decided to read in the order they were written. This was a read I found hard to put down. I did'n't guess &#34;WHO DID IT&#34; until the story ended. I highly recommend this book and have started her second DARK PLACES which again so far is a good mystery WHO DONEIT. Can't wait to read GONE GIRL.
0307887448|5.0|Supremely good. For video game nerds, pop culture aficionados and anyone who loves a good adventure story. Easily the best book I've read all year.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addictive.  Love it.  I can't hardly put it down.  It beats watching tv because there is nothing on worth watching.
0316228532|4.0|Easily 100 pages too long, but strangely addictive if you can make it far enough in to really understand Rowling's web of characters (most of whom are, somehow, both underdeveloped and overdeveloped.) Her efforts to prove that this is certainly, definitely, absolutely not Harry Potter are abundantly obvious.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Wow, Kenny Loggins, Gary Burr and Georgia Middleman have hit the nail on the head with their first release &#34;Finally Home.&#34; The trio just gels together with somg great songs, some up tempo and some slow and meaningful. I've always like Kenny as a solo artist but haven't heard this balanced melodic singing since the he and Jim Messina in the 70's. Gary and Kenny together blend so well singing, add Georgis and you have the glue. Three artists that really have something here.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For the first 70% of this book, I was so refreshed by the wit and sarcasm that I couldn't wait to get home to read it. We say &#34;LOL&#34; so frequently, and yet how often do we really do it? Well for me, it was 70% of the time I read this book. But I knew the last 30% was coming. I knew the tears would come, and the good byes would be made, and I knew I would have to keep going. And just like Hazel Grace and Gus would say about their love...it was so, so worth it.

Even calling it \\"pop-punk\\" makes me sick...You cant use PUNK ROCK in the same sentence<br />as these whiny sounding rich kids who arent even singing about ANYTHING that pertains to anything or anyone.<br />This music is as intelligent sounding as wiz kalifa, rick ross or any other rap music. NOTHING to offer, except killing off brain cells.<br />You interested?

075669812X|2.0|Ninjago came to our home by way of school friends.  It's one of the better looking Lego themes with great number of colorful characters.  However I, don't think themes and interactions invented by Lego are that educational and Ninjago cartoon series, from the few that I've seen are full of violent encounters and in my opinion more for 10+ than for 7 years old.  \\"Ninjago has to fight otherwise it would not be Ninjago.  It is not real and so why you so afraid of it\\"? - my son says.  To me, as a parent, the turn off was couple of Ninjago tv series I watched.  One, for example, had a scene glorifying suicide - as I was watching it with my son I was happy that he did not fully understand the gravity of the situation but I still had to come up with a PG explanation when it came up in a conversation.<br /><br />As for the book, overall I think the book is colorful and imaginative, I wish however that it was a gateway to something more educational.

Amazon if this is the way that it's going to be...then your going to be losing an all around customer. How much money do you need that I have to buy a Fire Hd to get what I've paid for? Maybe you should merge with Comcast and learn how to really stick it to your loyal customers. BOO AMAZON!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Look, I am not a huge reader, am not in a book club, and don't have much literary history to call upon for a proper review.  But I will say that I was intrigued to read this series. It was hard to get started. I think it took me a few weeks to get into much of the first book.  But somewhere mid-book, I became hooked.  And I agree with reviews I had read, that it seemed so simply written.  Not much depth to the descriptions or dialogue.  But it is very cult-like (i.e., Twilight series).  So, take my review with a grain of salt. But it was entertaining, and overall enjoyable.  Certainly not a work of literary genius. But fun.  It is what it is.  Oh, and some crazy sex stuff, almost makes ya blush.  Enjoy.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Really good to have Rebus back, 'though only 4 stars as I felt the ending slightly disappointing. Finished too easily somehow.
B004SIP9B0|4.0|It was entertaining.  Of course the parts that show Princess Diana were difficult to revisit.  If her life touched you as it did mine...you will hurt again.  Helen Mirren is a great actress and she does a good job.  British movies are so popular I think this could be a movie you would call a good British watch. Not an action or comedy for sure.

B0029XFNA8|5.0|My wife and I met in NYC and lived there for many years. While we never joined the Herald Square crowds at 34th & B'way to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, we always went down to Columbus Ave and West 77th to watch them inflate the balloons the evening before, right outside the Natural History Museum. The next day, we'd watch the parade from Central Park West, right near The Dakota (72nd Street) where much of this particular film is set.<br /><br />Because of that, \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" holds pride of place with our family as the first Xmas movie we watch every year from our now-always-temperate digs in SoCal - we watch the Macy's Parade on TV (well, at least until the insipid TV hosts send us screaming) and then segue neatly to the film, whose opening scenes are set at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.<br /><br />Personally, I still like the film a lot, even though its theme of \\"all you have to do is believe and things come true\\" is a bit juvenile...and even after realizing that the whole premise that gets the case against \\"Santa\\" dismissed is based on the fact that the USPS apparently breaks the law - the very law that had just been read in open court by defense lawyer Fred Gaily only moments before - when they \\"illegally\\" deliver all of those \\"Dear Santa\\" letters to the court in which Kris sits as the defendant. I guess one isn't supposed to notice such things when a feel-good story is reaching its climax.<br /><br />The BD comes up very well in its new transfer. Be advised that the BD does NOT contain the colorized version of this film that seems to be so popular. For that, you need to purchase the 2-disc DVD set that was released in 2006. That set gives you a number of extra features that aren't on this single BD as well, including the TV version of the story that was aired on December 14, 1955, and that features Thomas Mitchell (aka Uncle Billy in \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\") as Kris Kringle, with Teresa Wright as Doris and Macdonald Carey as Fred. This 46-minute version was produced for the \\"20th-Century Fox Hour.\\"<br /><br />Considering the fact that the 1947 Miracle has been an evergreen pretty much since its original theatrical release, one wonders why in the world it has been subjected to numerous updated versions, none of them particularly successful, despite featuring casts that at the time were considered to be quite capable. In addition to the 1955 version that appears on the DVD set mentioned above, these include a 1959 60-minute color TV version starring Ed Wynn as Kris (with Orson Bean as Dr Sawyer and Mary Healy as Doris), a perfectly awful 100 minute TV version from 1973 featuring Sebastian Cabot as Kris, Jane Alexander as Karen (aka Doris) and David Hartman as Fred, and - most recently - an overblown and irritating full-length film \\"remake\\" from 1994, featuring Richard Attenborough as Kris with the insufferable Mara Wilson as Doris' daughter, Susan.<br /><br />None of them comes close to the freshness and vitality of the 1947 original, so why did they bother?<br /><br />Stick with the original, and in the original B&W on BD, if you please.<br /><br />Recommended.his 46-minute version was produced for the \\"20th-Century Fox Hour.\\"<br /><br />Considering the fact that the 1947 Miracle has been an evergreen pretty much since its original theatrical release, one wonders why in the world it has been subjected to numerous updated versions, none of them particularly successful, despite featuring casts that at the time were considered to be quite capable.

B006OKOZGU|5.0|I've owned this film on VHS, DVD and now BD. It's one of my all-time favorites: a perfect match of story, cast, director and location.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality of this BD are an improvement even over the DVD, which was pretty good. There's more grain in the BD, so more detail. The colors pop nicely as well.<br /><br />I've been to the Côte d'Azur a couple of times, so I know Cannes pretty well. This movie always brings back very fond memories of the time I spent there, including driving along the Basse Cornisch between Monte Carlo and Nice. I'd watch this movie just for the scenery (which happens to include Grace Kelly and Cary Grant. Some scenery!).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0036OS3EM|5.0|I couldn't be happier with these boots.  They are super light weight yet so warm at the same time.  Easy to slip on and off.  Perfect for snow and rain.  They are very easy to clean.  I never use the adjustable strap, it doesn't ever seem necessary with the elastic around the top.  Depending on your outfit they could seem a bit bulky.  But overall wonderful boots.

It did seem a bit of a fairy tale at times (I am 50+) - the child we like to imagine. But also great tragedy in the book that was a bit like a cliche.  But I still found this very absorbing.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought of this quote more than once while reading Hopeless. From my initial expectations, over what this book started out to be, to what it turned out by the last page-we've gone a long way together and I'm glad to attest to the fact that it is a very good book.<br /><br />The first few chapters raised a red flag or two; I just don't like the brooding stalkerish emo hot guy character who, more often than not, doesn't have any reason to act the way he does besides being a a-hole. Not Dean Holder. His concern for Sky was sweet and genuine. It was incredible to watch him picking her up time after time as the past comes to catch up on them. There's this sentence in the summary that bothers me: \\" Sky soon finds that Holder isn't at all who he's been claiming to be.\\" Misleading? It's the reason why I expected that the story would go in another direction. So glad it didn't.<br /><br />This book is carefully constructed so that it's impossible to see the full picture until the end, when all the pieces fall together. If you think you know what the big secret is (I assume, if you've read some reviews, you already know), I'm sure you're in for a few surprises. The full extent of it comes to show at the end. There are consequences for almost every character involved, and I suppose that is my favorite part of this book. Consequences, people. No cop-outs that drive me insane, but tackling the issue from every angle, with honesty and sincerity.

The only thing I didnt like is it doesn't have the option to have the LED light on. It only turns on if you press it and it's in the other side of his bedroom which is a bummer.

B005LVR6ZA|5.0|This is a science-fiction masterpiece that does a great job to explore the boundaries between life and death. When reading through the book, it becomes clear that films like Inception have drawn a lot of inspiration from it. Starting with a rather dense prose, and at times bordering comedy and absurd, it evolves into a very engaging and thought-provoking story towards its middle, and a gripping one towards the last few chapters. Highly recommended.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! It's a shame that it didn't get a lot of publicity....that may be due to the raw political context. A must see!!!!!!

B00AHTYGRW|1.0|I was looking for a little more than what this movie was about.  Being old enough to remember all of this situation and following it through my younger years, this movie was totally incomplete. The story about how the entrance into Iran was OK, but the rest of the movie left little to be desired.<br /><br />The Quality of the Blu-ray was grainy and terribly produced. I don't know if I got a bad disc, but I have DVDs that have better quality than this Blu-ray. Additionally, the movie had a very bad lip sync problem.  Even with my DVDO, I could not get the lip sync right. I was near right at a + 5ms, in my OPPO BD-93, but still bad enough, that I took it out of my OPPO BD-93 and put it in my Pioneer Elite Blu-ray player, to no avail. The picture was still grainy and the lip sync still bad enough that it took a + 6ms increase in the audio delay from my DVDO to make it watchable. That is still an ongoing issue with blu-ray movies, and you would think after all the years blu-ray has been out, they would finally be able to sync the sound with the movies. Most of the time it is OK, but every now and then, you get one like this. That is why I am still angry that HD DVD lost that format war, because the HD DVD was a much better format.<br /><br />Back to the movie; if you want to see this movie, wait till yo can get it in the Wal-Mart $5 bin, or buy the DVD or stream it, but not only would I not recommend this to a friend, I would not even recommend it to my enemies.<br /><br />Update: went back to Best Buy and exchanged it.  Same problem.  Lip sync terrible and grainy picture. Took it back and got the DVD, and it was better than the Blu-Ray.Lip sync to only+ 1 Ms to sync, but Blu -ray has a problem.

B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I never knew if he was a patient or a friend.  It was a confusing story line.  It started out him waltzing onto a boat that appeared to be Hoffman's characters and given a job but I'm not sure what the job was, then the next thing is he's a patient.  I Just don't know...maybe I couldn't get involved enought in the movie to be able to figure it out.

B001FVV2X2|4.0|I'm watching this on Prime, never having seen the series before, and am impressed by the fact that it's five seasons long.  How'd I miss this one? Although it took a number of episodes (about 10) to get the characters in place and tone down some of the hyperactive portrayals, the stories are always good, the scientific theories credible and the flow is even paced and sensible.  I'm looking forward to the next four seasons.  Seeing the discussions of how they series ends is a blessing and a curse.  It gives me clues to the development and foreshadows the eventual demise of what I expect will be hours of enjoyable Sci Fi.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|My son was born on Groundhog day, so this movie has special meaning for me.  I love Bill Murray's dry sense of humor.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It kept you interested until it became a little too unrealistic with too much pornography which makes for boring reading.  But the storyline was still interesting.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|The movie is excellent on all counts. The mix is Horrible. At least on the Amazon instant download.  Thevoicesarereallow ANDTHEMUSICISREALLOUD . And the voice track is real low .AND THE MUSIC IS REAL LOUD. And this is a movie about a recording studio. Does Dave not know how to mix ? That's pretty funny.  I tried it on my tv, laptop and iPad . Same results. Great movie otherwise. Hopefully the blu ray is better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book got you interested in the tales of a rich sadistic individual who cares about pleasing himself, if you believe this.  It is also portrays ways to excite the inner person, if you believe this.  Besides all of the pornography which engulfs this book there really is a good story in here, if you believe this.  Interested yet?
0446585041|5.0|I love Ellen DeGeneres and this book had me laughing from the very first...Her humor is just so unique and her writing in my mind sounded like she does..I could hear her saying what the book said... I am still smiling, she is such a gift.  The book arrived in time for me to take on vacation...good surprise.
B00797MB0O|5.0|I watched this movie on the plane, expecting an edgy but ultimately fluff comedy. Instead, I was treated to a stark, yet strangely tender, look at what it means to grow older without growing up. Theron gives a supple and \\"adult\\" performance, making hairpin turns from desperation, determination and denial to humiliating scenes of tenderness. She paints a portrait of a pretty girl that is ugly and, in its way, more truthful about the pains of aging and confronting the limitations of one's own nature than many \\"serious\\" dramas. The role has more meat on it and more room for Theron to maneouver than many self-serious psycho-dramas. This movie made me hunger for more psychologically complex roles for women, and for Theron in particular.<br /><br />I have no idea how this movie ever made it into the \\"comedy\\" category, but suspect that this label was itself meant as a joke--and to fool a public that would have little idea what to do with a movie that is properly uncategorizable.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|it gives me plenty of backplates for options, the touchscreen is way easier to use to change settings, I prefer this over the wifi app by far. A must have!

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Arrived quickly and well packed.  Could not wait to see the continuation of this most unlikely pair doing the unlikely task of making meth.  Each episode is as suspenseful as the next.  We finished watching the whole second season in three days and ordered the third season.  Put this season up for sale in near perfect condition and will continue this process until we catch up.

B000X97Z60|5.0|Fast delivery and I really  liked this cd.  I saw them in concert last fall (Sept 2012) and was impressed with the show.  The new singer sounds very close to original singer.  I didn't own any of their stuff prior to going to concert, but I've quite a bit of their music on Pandora.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|The best book I've read this year.The way she describes events and emotions, she is gifted.For example,the evening at the concert.I could hear the music and feel the hairs on my arms stand up.I found the book dominated my time because I couldn't put it down.It was funny and very sad.I recommend it be read by all.

B00A812HOS|5.0|The sophomore release from UMO is much more of a grower of an album compared to their self-titled debut.  While the debut was characterized by in-your-face riffs and melodies, there is more of a diverse, subtle, sprawling soundscape throughout, reaching out to territory the debut didn't touch.  It's a soundscape that takes multiple listens to fully delve into, not to say that there aren't those same kind of awesome riffs and melodies we've come to love present here as well.  While the debut is still slightly superior, both albums are excellent, and among my favorites, and UMO is definitely one of my favorite bands around.  See them live if you can, they're incredible.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Love everything about this album and band  ordering was easy and got cd before time estimate Love Lady Antebellum !!!!
B00A93ENX8|2.0|Rush on CD has been a mixed bag over the years. Counterparts is one of my favorite RUsh albums and arguably the best between 1990 and now for many. I never thought the original mastering job sounded bad. The loudness wars had yet to truly kick in and ruin things (see: Vapor Trails - which has more problems than just mastering - and Clockwork Angels). The remaster done by Atlantic a few years back wasn't much, if any, improvement to my ears.<br /><br />That said, when I heard that Audio Fidelity was going to do Counterparts and make it a hybrid SACD, I was cautiously optimistic. The Bad Company gold disc I have from AF sounds decent, but I was very disappointed in the mastering on my favorite album of all time, The Grand Illusion by Styx. That particular disc was also mastered by Kevin Gray as was Counterparts. I did not like that version at all. Here's a snippet of a review I wrote of a GI shootout elsewhere as a point of reference:<br />In terms of the two new pressings, I came a way a bit cold after listening to the Audio Fidelity. Between the narrower soundstage and the overall tonality, I can't help but feel it sucked some of the fun out of the album. A song like \\"Miss America\\" sounds too restrained; it needs to rock. A song like \\"Fooling Yourself\\" needs to sound open and airy; it doesn't here. \\"Come Sail Away\\" (its middle) and \\"Castle Walls\\" are moody; they aren't on this release. Overall, I'd say the AF is closer to the D32Y but with more resolution, slightly louder, and a narrower soundstage. Quite frankly, I feel GI loses its majestic nature on the AF, and this version feels like a missed opportunity since it's clear Universal/A&M will not be releasing album remasters.<br /><br />I could almost write the same about Counterparts. CP here has a much narrower soundstage versus the original, and to me, just does not rock at all. It's too polite. There feels like there is no immediacy to this presentation. It's like someone gave the album a small lobotomy. However, a song like \\"Nobody's Hero\\" - at least the first part - sounds improved here up until the point it needs to kick in.  I guess I should have learned my lesson after Grand Illusion.<br /><br />I own plenty of SACDs and gold discs in my collection, but I don't see this one gracing my player again any time soon. I wish I felt differently.<br /><br />As a comparison, I got Yes' Close to the Edge and while not as good as Mobile Fidelity's version of The Yes Album, it's better than Counterparts. Whatever you may think of Steve Hoffman, he did an OK job on that one.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like Kevin Gray's mastering style, this version of Counterparts may be for you. It's clear Mr. Gray and I are 0 for 2.

B008ALA6DW|5.0|Not much to say, this is Apple's product and worked as I had expected. Much faster data transfer than using a USB to Ethernet adapter.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock is so helpful because of its great ability at waking me up whenever i need to! I can wake up to the radio, my favorite song, or one of the provided alarms you can choose from. I also like that you can make an alarm repeat whenever you need it to so that you dont have to remember to turn it on again. I highly recommend this app!!!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is my second reading of this excellent novel after several decades and the equally great movie of the same title with Donald Sutherland starring in the role as the infamous German espionage agent.<br /><br />I also appreciate his more recent departure to his two trilogies with construction over two centuries of the English cathedral and pre and aftermath of our wars in the 20h Century.  These two sets of novels are a departure for Ken Follett that amply reflect his  genius as one of the greatest novelists of all time.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Not good, don't waste your time on watching this. The picture quality with Amazon wasn't as good as expected either.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A feel-good book with a spiritual twist. Fast read. Nicholas Sparks at his usual best. No interest in seeing the movie.
B009LGO88E|5.0|At first I thought it was defective but after learning more about it I was able to get it working and works great. I also love the added size to help fit your hands better.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|These really are the best of the Batman franchise movies.  Very gritty, and dark.  Not comical like the rest.  It is a long movie packed with a lot of story and action.  I enjoyed it a lot.
B000VNMMR0|1.0|Mark Bomback wrote the story and screenplay.  Trite and marvel comic book writing.  I do not see how a mature human being can sit through the movie.  I only made it through the first fifteen minutes.  Bomback should have gone to France and hired any third rate script writer to help him improve the script. Terrible!
0307341550|4.0|Months after finishing Sharp Objects I'm still thinking about this book.  The main character is terribly flawed, but more than that the complex characters and breakneck pacing will pull readers through the booking kicking and screaming.  There were several times I wanted to quit reading this book, since none of the characters really have any redeeming traits.  But I had to know what happened.<br /><br />And the ending?  Like a punch in the gut.  A brilliant story.

9889979942|5.0|I first heard about Tom Carter (The author/Photographer of this book.) about 3 or so years ago.  You see, I have plans, and am currently working on a similar project, to travel all of China to photograph it and in the research learnt that Tom completed his journey in 2 years.  I have now been in China for nearly 5 years and can only say that I've traveled to less than half of the provinces!  The scope of this country is so large that getting and sharing minute differences takes time and effort of which Tom wonderfully mastered with his travels.<br /><br />I can say with authority on traveling the country and attempting to photograph it's many cultures, histories, and people that what Tom did with his book, China: Portrait of a People is something that will not be done again.  The manner in which page after page creates stories, brings you IN the moment is wonderful.  As a professional photographer, I employ many things Tom doesn't really like so that my photos look polished.  Tom's body of work presented in this book show that it doesn't matter how much Photoshop you do, but more importantly that your images create and convey a feeling.<br /><br />Lastly, I just want to say to Tom, and those of you looking to purchase a photo book on China, is that I feel this book showcases what makes China great.  I hope more people within China, and especially those outside China, look at images such as are those in China: Portrait of a People and began to respect the similarities in their own culture, and especially realize the differences are just as wonderful.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I loved the first season, and I love the second season as much, or more. Cannot wait for the third season to come out. The amazon digital service has worked great for me. So easy to use. Haven't even taken out the DVDs or Blu-rays. If they come out with Blu-ray/dvd combo with digital, I won't think twice about getting it. Love to have options.

B00AB55BS0|5.0|It seems every TV series I start to really get into, they cancel. I hope it doesn't happen to this one. It is a very raw/real show in my eyes. But that is what I love about it. They don't hold back anything. By far, this is my favorite show out there right now, and I hope it continues until it is completely over.

B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I knew from the first time that I heard the music that Gaston Leroux would be turning over in his grave at the direction that his characters had been taken in. That being said, in what other direction could a Phantom of the Opera sequel go? The story of the Phantom of the Opera was wrapped up so nicely, both in the book and in the Lloyd Webber telling, as to prevent a good sequel being possible.<br /><br />The sequel was created anyway. And, like any good Phantom of the Opera fan, I was drawn to it, even realizing that it couldn't possibly be good. Our beloved characters became people that they never would have become and did things that they never would have done. Christine's fate seemed to be the best possible ending. It would have been a shame for her to discover that she was merely the prize in a cock fight, for lack of a better term. The final showdown between the Phantom and Raoul demonstrated, not a great love for our heroine, but a fervent desire to win.<br /><br />Still, no one tells a bad story quite as well as Andrew Lloyd Webber. I enjoyed watching it, in spite of its short comings. The sets were gorgeous, a few of the songs had merit, and the singing was good.

1451683405|1.0|The way this book was introduced to me, and upon reading a spattering of reviews, I thought this might be a reasonably good argument against free will which I could look through while writing up my argument in favor of free will. I was wholly mistaken, as I quickly learned upon reading assumption after assumption completely lacking in introspection or actual insight into the matter at hand. In fact, every time Harris brings up his introspective process it inevitably ends a few questions in with \\"I don't know.\\" I'm quite sure that \\"I don't know,\\" has never been an acceptable argument for how something is, as it merely displays ineptitude of the person saying it in the course of finding answers. It's even more disheartening when the person in question is relatively well respected and is showing a complete lack of ability to understand himself. How can anyone expect him to make accurate broad statements about humanity when he can't even determine why he read a given book nor why it compelled him as it did?<br /><br />He has an irritating habit of using the phrase \\"Where's the freedom in that?\\" when it's entirely uncalled for, which simply displays that he feels a need to push the point where there isn't one. For instance, after mentioning a book he read he describes various groups of people according to whether they'll read it and whether they'll find it useful, and asks where the freedom is in any of that. The answer is blatantly obvious - it's in the individuals choosing which category they'll fit in to! But of course from Harris's limited perspective there is no free will, so he's completely unable to see that answer.<br /><br />All in all he's full to the brim with dogmatic assumptions, devoid of any meaningful insight, and actually self-conflicting in that he espouses the importance of freedom and speaks of how, upon realizing you are a biochemical puppet, you can grab hold of your strings. He has a point there, and it destroys his whole argument - upon true realization of some aspect of yourself, upon a heightening of self-awareness, you gain another degree of conscious control by being able to manipulate that which manipulates your behavior, and thus FREE WILL.

Probably not for the younger crowd, but for old coots of a certain age, this is one of those movies that you have to have in your collection.

0061978078|4.0|This second installment of the Delirium series takes place both in the wilds and in New York during a resistance movement, moving back and forth in time. The chapters are pretty clear about where you are.<br /><br />The story starts soon after Lena escapes over the fence and how she survives in the Wilds. I loved the addition of some of the new characters, especially Raven. I have to say, though, that there were a few logistics about their life in the Wilds that drove me crazy, like: Why do they wait until winter's there before they move camps? Why don't they just live somewhere warmer and set up a homestead and try to become self sufficient? Why do they have to rely on the cities for so much? Why, if there is a hardware store nearby, do they only have one shovel? OK, enough of that rant. These are not deal breaker issues, the story was still great, just things that frustrated me.<br /><br />On the other hand, this time in the Wilds was compelling, the dynamics of the community, the constant peril, the heartbreak of peoples stories...<br /><br />In contrast, the story alternates in a future time as part of an underground resistance movement in New York. There were some great twists in this part and, again, the addition of some new characters. I liked Julian, the son of the DFA leader, and how he grew and how the alliances and betrayals worked out.<br /><br />I really love this series, though I didn't like this book as much as Delirium. Oliver's writing is brilliant and absolutely beautiful - she crafts words like an artist. And, I love the premise behind this book - that of a dystopian future where love can be \\"cured\\", along with the consequences of that. After the dramatic twist at the end, I can hardly wait to get my hands on Requiem (one of the advantages to coming to a series late!)

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is great! There are no flaws, the app works perfectly, is fast, and very enjoyable. There are five \\"packs\\" and each pack has 150 puzzles inside. There is also a time version when you have to finish a certain amount of puzzles in the given time period, 30 sedons, 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 4 minutes. There are also additional packs you can purchase for 99 cents, but the app itself is free. I would definately recommend this to anyone, any age; my three year old cousin even \\"plays\\" the game!

Once I figured out how to use the quick macro button properly I found it incredibly easy to keybind things with it as well. This gamepad is also very useful in my professional work with programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign as well.

0812992784|4.0|On February 14, 1989, Salman Rushdie, one of the era's preeminent novelists, awoke to find that he had been sentenced to death.  Not by a court of law after a long trial of evidence for some heinous crime.  Not by a doctor who after exhaustive tests had determined that he had a fatal disease.  No.  Rushdie had been put under a fatwa by radical Islamic extremists who objected to his latest novel, The Satanic Verses.  Most had not read it, but decided that it was blasphemous and that he must die for his ideas.  For the next thirteen years, Rushdie was a marked man who had to live under the strictest security imaginable.<br /><br />Joseph Anton is Rushdie's memoir of this time in his life.  Joseph Anton was the pseudonym he chose, Joseph for Joseph Conrad and Anton for Anton Chekhov.  For thirteen years, this was his name as he lived undercover.  He was moved from location to location, rarely having the luxury of being in the same place for more than a few months.  Airlines refused to fly him and countries refused to let him enter due to the security issues.  He had four policeman who lived with him for those years.  Imagine how this works.  You are trying to live a family life but there are four strangers always there.  Strangers who decide what you will be allowed to do.  You can't go to your child's school functions, and there are whole months that you can't even see your child.  You can't decide to walk down to the corner store or go see friends.  You can't even go outside to check your mail.<br /><br />During this time, life did go on after a fashion.  Friends came and went.  Children were born and they grew, knowing only the reality of a restricted life and the constant fear that their parent would not be there tomorrow.  Marriages were made and broken; a constant wonder about whether love would have lasted without the artificial restraints it was lived under.  Governments showed courage at times, but often only political expediency, and the constant recalculation of whether standing up to the terrorists was a smart political move.<br /><br />Salman Rushdie has long been one of my favorite authors so I knew I would like this book.  The writing is superb as he takes the reader through the long years of disenfranchisement and constraints.  The issue about whether freedom of ideas and speech is indeed an issue we are willing to protect is paramount.  Does one stand up for that right knowing that death may be the result, or cave in to those who would take it from you?  While Salman survived, there were those who didn't; translators and editors who were targeted and killed, rioters who lost their lives.  Can a society give in to the fear that a dedicated group of extremists is willing to die to defeat?  All these are important questions, and Rushdie's book gives the reader the ability to frame the discussion and make a decision.n of whether standing up to the terrorists was a smart political move.<br /><br />Salman Rushdie has long been one of my favorite authors so I knew I would like this book.

While Ico's gameplay mechanics show their age and Shadow of the Colossus didn't quite take me to the same place it took me more than five years ago, this collection astounds.<br /><br />Technical updates aside, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus deserve more than just one trip down memory lane.
0307960471|4.0|After his last case, the pursuit of the serial killer The Snowman, Harry Hole's life has changed.  He left the police force in Oslo and moved to Hong Kong to pursue a new life and try to escape the demons that pursue his dreams.  But, plans often don't work out as one plans, and Harry's plans are not working out either.<br /><br />Harry is drawn back to Oslo when news arrives that Oleg, the closest he will ever have to a son, has been arrested for murder.  The victim?  Oleg's best friend and unfortunately, his partner in crime and addiction, Gusto.  For both young men had become addicted to violin, the synthetic heroin that has overtaken the Oslo drug scene.  They soon turn to selling the drug to support their habits, and now Gusto is dead and Oleg fits the mold as the killer.  But Harry is not able to reconcile the young boy he loved and helped raise with a cold-blooded killer and drug addict.<br /><br />Harry is not a policeman anymore, but that hardly seems to matter.  His old friends on the force and in various jobs throughout the city still are willing to help him.  Soon, Harry has peeled away the skin of the setup Oleg has been fitted with, and is deep in the search for the men who have brought violin to Oslo, and those in the government and perhaps the police that have joined with them rather than stopping them.<br /><br />Fans of the Nesbo series will not be disappointed, and those who are reading the series for the first time will be enthralled.  Harry is definitely not the average policeman, but there is no one better at determining the truth than this deeply flawed man.  The plot becomes increasingly tense as the book progresses, and the reader will find themselves putting the book down periodically just to take a break from the tension.  This book is recommended for mystery lovers who will be thrilled to read of another Harry Hole investigation.
B008B68J2G|5.0|Monster High Travel Scaris Caf&eacute; Cart<br /><br />The plastic pieces in the kit are fairly well made, with minimal mold flashes and sharp edges. The bat on the top is rather cute.<br /><br />The color and the overall design is very good. The use of the vibrant colors made it very attractive and pleasing. The assembly wasn't too difficult, as only a few decorative items had to be snapped onto the umbrella. Compared to the Coffin Bean play set, the Travel Scaris has more detail and vibrant colors, and the cart has moveable wheels.<br /><br />The cardboard background scenery is a great design, because it can also be used as a backdrop when playing with the cart or for other craft projects. It easily stimulates the imagination.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars, makes a great addition to a Monster High collection!
0307887448|5.0|It is 2044, and Earth is not a place most people enjoy living.  Due to over consumption, energy is massively expensive so most do not travel.  Living quarters are cramped with multiple people sharing houses.  Jobs are scarce and most people just live off the grid.<br /><br />But there is one thing that makes life worth living.  OASIS.  OASIS is the next generation Internet, and gives everyone the ability to live in a totally virtual world where they can be anywhere as anyone, anytime.  OASIS is the brainchild of James Halliday, and he became so rich that he made sure it would be free for everyone.  When Halliday died, he left his entire mega-fortune to whomever could solve a series of riddles he had concocted around his fascinations; coding, video games and the cultural icons of the 1980s.<br /><br />Wade Watts is one of the people who lives virtually.  The virtual world is so much better than his reality where he shares a trailer with 18 other people when his aunt lets him in the door.  Socially inept, his only social contacts are in the virtual world, where he attends school and has become known for his gaming knowledge.<br /><br />After five years of frantic searching for the answers to Halliday's riddles, the search has died down.  That all changes when Watts figures out the answer to the first riddle and becomes an instant celebrity.  He becomes friends with those who also figure out the riddle, and they all fight against a huge corporation whose only purpose is to solve the riddles, gain Halliday's fortune and take over the OASIS as a moneymaking venture, ending life as it is now.  Can the group of underdog friends use their knowledge and skills to outsmart the minions of the corporation?<br /><br />Cline has written a wonderful novel.  The pace is fast, the plot satisfactorily twisted.  The real draw, though, is to those interested in technology, fantasy and gaming.  The book will remind all computer nerds (like me!) why they fell in love with technology and remind them of the mindless obsession that can keep one up all night getting to a new level or solving a technical issue.  This book is recommended for anyone interesting in a fast-paced quest with a satisfying resolution.remind them of the mindless obsession that can keep one up all night getting to a new level or solving a technical issue.

0307278409|4.0|Zhung is a young Chinese girl who is sent to London for a year to learn English by her parents, factory owners, so that she can fit more easily into the new Chinese economy.  She arrives with very little English, tossed into the ocean of new faces, words, meals, customs and cultures.  Her most useful possession is her Chinese-English dictionary, which she uses incessantly as she tries to learn enough to maneuver through this foreign environment.<br /><br />Her days are taken by attendance at the English language school; her nights are lonely since she knows no one and has no idea where she might go.  Finally, she discovers the cinema and starts going there at night.  She meets a man there and moves in with him within a week or two of their meeting date.  She lives with him for the next year, experiencing England through his eyes and how he perceives the world to work.<br /><br />Zhuang, or 'Z' as she comes to be known for convenience, finds the gap between how she has experienced the world and how her lover does to be extremely wide and difficult to bridge.  To her, moving in with her lover means they are exclusive and that he will satisfy every need she has.  To him, while he professes to love her, his need is for some space and time for him to pursue his relationships with his friends and even former lovers.  Z has a difficult time understanding this.  Their time together is marked by her attempts to get her lover to commit to only her, and to his withdrawal and anger at her attempts to restrict his life.  Throughout the time, she learns more and more about the English language, but the English outlook on life continues to elude her.<br /><br />Xiao has created an interesting novel.  Each segment is started with a word from the dictionary, the definition of that word in a formal sense, and then how Z experiences what that concept means in this foreign environment.  The reader is allowed to watch her grow and learn and to see how her culture differs from the one she finds herself in.

0385536828|5.0|The year is 1972, and Serena Frome has just graduated from Cambridge.  She hasn't exactly covered herself in academic glory and is unsure what to do with her life.  When she is recruited by M15, based on the recommendation of her tutor and lover, Tony, who worked for the service for many years she accepts.<br /><br />Much to her dismay, women's liberation has not made its way through the doors of M15.  Women officers are delegated to secretarial work and expected to be grateful for the task.  After months of this, Serena is excited to be given a chance to do something worthwhile, something that will make a difference.  The service is starting a new operation; one that will support authors who seem to be fighting the liberal bent.  They will be given enough funds to allow them to concentrate on their writing without having to work at menial jobs.  In return, without the author realising it, the government's views will be out there serving as a counterpoint to the established liberal bent.  Serena, known as a reader, is given the task of signing up Tom Haley, an up and coming author.<br /><br />Serena goes to meet Tom, posing as the employee of a foundation.  The foundation exists, it just doesn't advertise that its money comes from the government.  Tom is sceptical, but soon realises he can't pass up this marvelous opportunity.  Neither can he pass up Serena.  Soon they are madly in love, spending every weekend together.<br /><br />The book focuses on the dilemma Serena faces.  She never expected to fall in love with Tom.  If she comes clean about how they came to meet, he will undoubtedly leave her for her deceit.  Of course, she would also lose her job.  But can she really continue to fool Tom about her part in his career?  Will he decide that he has no talent but that of echoing the sentiments the government finds most pleasing, or if so, can he ever forgive Serena?<br /><br />McEwan has written an interesting story, full of plots and counterplots, ethical dilemmas and the ways we fool ourselves to get what we want.  There are layers upon layers of intricate plans and secrets, betrayals and loyalties which are tested.  This book is recommended for readers of literary fiction and for those interested in how love can work and if it can ever survive betrayal.s and the ways we fool ourselves to get what we want.

B001R3YRG2|5.0|Who hasn't had a bad day where everything in your path seems to go awry?  I think a lot of people could easily just snap but thankfully they are few and in between.  Customer service is at an all time low, gang violence increases daily, people are downsized at an alarming rate, etc and we would all like a solution to it.  Another good example is the experienced officer who is retiring and the younger inexperienced officers think he doesn't know what he's talking about.  They think they know better and probably couldn't solve a crime if it happened before their eyes.  We might fantasize about retaliation but there are so many other ways to deal with life's shortcomings but I enjoyed this movie.  Now that I escaped life for a short time, it's back to reality.

B00A5IYXY6|4.0|\\"Aki Kaurismaki's Le Havre strikes on many different levels as being altogether a French New Wave homage (Truffaut brings to mind), a social critique about immigration, and a comedy-drama about a man trying to help a young Gabonese boy flee to London. While a film of this calibre maybe perceived as pretentious, and annoying because it is a French film with subtitles, it is however not together all that bad. More striking, being a first-time Kaurismaki and a new-found viewer of world cinema, is how the film takes its direction on a rather controversial subject by today's matters and converges it to a more apolitical fable about caring and human emotion. Le Havre is not necessarily bawdy or much in the vein of a slapstick film but moreover an intelligent piece that seems to do excellent in the department of style, cinematography, and sometimes screenwriting. It is something original and mild-mannered that, during a time full of noisy, violent, and often too opinionated films, films like this one are one in a few. While I may not understand the culture of the northern French town as well, it is always interesting to see how believable yet ironic moments can be here. Aside from all this praise, the film does suffer from timing and pacing, a striking climax, and monotony in the acting department. If this was intentional, then it can be considered passable just like a Wes Anderson film like Rushmore or Fantastic Mr. Fox. Still, Le Havre and possibly Leningrad Boys Go America are two comedies that first-time Kaurismaki, Finnish film aficionados, and world cinema lovers should not miss.\\"

B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis' Kind of Blue serves as one of the most hailed records in music history. While not relevant in the modern age of many music listeners, it is important to remember that before Swift, Spears, Bieber, and Perry, you had something full of rich, clean yet unpredictable rhythms. Many pioneers of this \\"new world, new sound\\" as I put it also include the famed John Coltrane and Herbie Hancock and their respectively similar albums to Kind of Blue's prevalence include Coltrane's Blue Train and Hancock's Head Hunters group album or even the 2008 Grammy Album of the Year album River: The Joni Letters.<br /><br />Even when 900+ reviews have reviewed this album, it would be fair to say that Davis incorporates a feeling of introducing the listeners into a sometimes joyous and sometimes sad environment. In this environment, the presence of poly-rhythmic orchestration, syncopation, and subtle emotions convey you into a new world not only known as jazz music but music of realism and emotion. An album of this calibre is best said calculating and enriched for the suit-and-tie Justin Timberlake Martini-drinking man or woman in all of us but it is also a universal album that is full of variety even when may seem it is not.<br /><br />In short, Without Kind of Blue, and even other records like In a Silent Way (an album I recently reviewed) and B_____ Brew, you would not have A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, Funki Porcini, Four Tet, Kruder & Dorfmeister, and even Stereolab given some of their loungey vibes.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|As a Christian, I appreciate the author's validation of NDEs not being a misfire of dying synapses.  But I also feel that he missed an incredible opportunity to talk more about the Divine aspects of his experience.  He was too occupied with how incredible his meningitis was and not busy enough with figuring out why his NDE was incomplete.  He also hesitates in tying Jesus into the whole universal dimension.  Last, he talks WAY over the average reader's medical comprehension.  You really need some medical background to fully understand much of this book. This was truly disappointing and I can't wait to read the Christian Rebuttal book.

B005LAIHE0|2.0|There are what seems like several points in the movie where this thing could have been done better.  the story drags on and you feel as if it might never end.  Some of the casting choices have the same effect.  I find it hard swallow the couple dynamics that run throughout the feature.  Its hard not to hate the main pairing and for whatever reason I never wanted them to unite.  At one point his parents point out that not even 60% compatibility is needed for a couple to survive.<br /><br />If this maxim is true then why even bother rooting for anyone.  Just pick random people and stick with it.  The \\"B\\" couple with kids seem much better a story to focus on and I think the writing missed a chance there.<br /><br />In the end you'd just wished you watched the dang think in fast forward.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! SHOCKING ending...didn't even see it coming!! A great read...easy and fast but definitely keeps your attention throughout the book.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is a wonderful book!!!!  Start early,  you can't put it down once you start it!!!  It is very exciting!

B0054S6N04|4.0|Somewhat predictable but I enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it as light summer  reading. Or winter reading. Or even fall reading. Sorry, it kept making me add words. Lol
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  I have never been so drawn into a book.  From the very beginning, I couldn't put it down.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Reminded me of how i felt watching the movie Apollo 13.  Read through it as though i was as invested as a NASA employee.<br />Very suspenseful.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|As always.. great music.. great service in the ordering.old memories brought back in style... glad I could still get it.
B002RI9TB4|4.0|We really do not realize how lucky we are to live where we do!!<br />I found this book so sad to read, but, the people were so positive<br />and fought hard for what they believed in. Incredible.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is one of those books that I can't stop reading despite knowing I need to go to sleep.  Instead, I just read until I pass out.  Great story, beautiful characters and wonderful writing!  I can't wait for the third book!  Need more Kvothe!
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Received this product on time.  One of the songs did not play properly and it was so easy to return and they sent me a new one immediately.  I was so impressed that I did not have to fight or argue about returning the product.  The new one that they sent worked perfectly.
B000P0J074|5.0|a couple of nice homebody ghosts, trying to rid their house of afamily of trendsetting human beings, is hell-bent on making theirhome unlivable -- even for the dead.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Received product on time and works perfectly!  I love this CD.  What I do not love is having to write a certain amount of words in order to submit this review.  The next time I think I will not review the product.  I should not be made to submit a certain amount of words.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was great. I enjoyed it much more than the movie. I would recommend it to anyone with emotional baggage or anyone trying to understand someone with emotional baggage.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|really much of modern rock has used all of Jimi's stuff and most people are not aware of it.<br />there is so much going on that people over look it, in this album it sounds a bit hard at times<br />but you can see how it can influence rock music, this is a template on how to make music.

1439153663|5.0|Read for my bookclub.  Great story.  Characters come to life.  The writer did a wonderful job weaving her story through the different  characters...and this is her first novel.  It sheds the light on the life of slaves in the south in the late 1700's, early 1800;s.  If you like historical fiction this book is a good one.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The only thing better would have been seeing Led Zep live when they performed it.<br /><br />If you love the group - you will want this for your collection!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved the book! Although several parts can read a bit technical the humor scattered throughout the book make this a great read.  I really enjoyed the Author's writing style and look forward to reading another Andy Weir book.  It says something about the author that the first thing I did once I finished this book was to see if he has anything else available.<br /><br />Pick this up, you won't regret it.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I loved it. Lula and Tank are hilarious. And I love Diesel, he's awesome. Another great book by Janet Evanovich!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love the Indy movies, so no doubt I would have purchased this amazing looking box set on blu ray! Picture quality looks great in all four films and that includes the amazing audio quality.<br />What I really love about this release is the bonus features disc. It is just filled with tons of special features and making of the films that just seemed endless. I simply love this set and would recommend all blu ray, movie and Indy fans to get this release. Looks great on the shelf too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's great if you don't have this game get it!!! I love it so much I play every for at least 30 mins.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I installed this app on my kindle fire and I even have two accounts with yahoo mail, I am able to be connected on both at the same time. It gives me the same characteristics as the computer. I recommend it!
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|I used this to hook up my FireWire 400 external hard drive to my newer MacBook Pro that only has a FireWire 800 outlet.  Plugging the female end of the adapter into one end of my FW 400 cable and then plugging the male end of it into my computer did the trick.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Although the app is the same as using your computer its a little bit more difficult and not all of the characteristics shown in the computer you can visualize in the app, at least I haven't been able to use it properly.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very easy to play. Like all the different layouts.  It would be nice to chose different tiles and back ground.
6305910189|5.0|It is great being able to see old movies on DVD.  This is a classic and one that will endure to years to come.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I had the three books in this series for a long time before I read them. I read all 3 books one right after the other and wanted more. They are well written, great stories, interesting characters, can't say enough good things about the writting and the books. You are really missing out if you don't read these books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A tear jerker that I just couldn't put down. My heart hurts for these incredibly well developed, deep characters. This is the type of book that you sit and think about and cry about and re-read time and time again. This that book. It makes you feel like you just met a whole town of new people and they're your best friends giving you a window into their lives. Thank you John Green. Thank you.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I had the three books in this series for a long time before I read them. I read all 3 books one right after the other and wanted more.

B00BESNKB8|3.0|If you are really into Kung Fu movies, you will love this.  If you are really into really oldschool WuTang, you will love this.  If you don't it's a little disappointing.
B00B2064IY|5.0|This is a look into where Jimi was back in 68 and 69. He was definatly searching for a new direction for his music and it shows in this CD. Listen to &#34;Somewhere&#34; and you will hear Hendrix at his best. His guitar playing is so clean and every note is so distinct. It is a shame he passed on before his time. I would love to hear today where that direction he is heading in this CD had taken him.<br />Theres so much more in the Hendrix archives that has not been heard. Younger folks would benefit by listening to his music. Find out where the inspiration of thier heros of today had come from.  Great Music here!!! Hendrix is a teacher today even 40 years after his untimely passing.
B000002MIB|5.0|I love this group and this DVD really shows them at their best! Great songs, great footage, what more can you ask for?!
B009A9EQL6|5.0|Another fantastic album from this great band. Long life for these guys. I have all the cds of this amazing band.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|It's so cute and I love monkeys! Very informative too! Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys nature! You'll love it too!
B004GYY714|2.0|Would have been a great app if it did not keep popping up on my screen when I didn't even have the app running.  I did not have the patience for this.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This captures the Eagles at their best. I found I liked every song and it showcased even the guys solo efforts!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|For a free game, I'd say this is worth at least 3.99 or lower. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is smooth. To add, because of this game it has renewed my interest in the upcoming Sacred 3 game which is rumored to be just like this style of gameplay.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|At first I was disappointed to learn that she had not continued her own creative style of writing as her first album which was so hauntingly beautiful but after listening to this album I can say she made a smart choice in both choosing songs that suit her and are classic without being overdone and creating an overall theme by having each song reflective of a month of the year. She takes each song and makes it her own in a beautiful way. A nice soothing yet uplifting album that makes me smile every time I hear it. Im really glad she did this even though I love her original music as well. Like I said she can really sing ANYTHING and this album proves it. Such an amazing voice with so much emotion and youthful energy. I love it!! Thanks Emmy!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is beautiful and a must read for so many. It will make you smile and make you cry. Zusak is a beautiful writer and has managed to make this one of my all time favorite book. EVERYONE PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. This is the first time I've ever cried while reading a book and I must say this is absolutely beautiful book.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Absolutely my favorite Bond film.  Craig adds a welcome grit to the role.  The new 007 is inexperienced, imperfect, and a bit of a loose cannon.  A lot of the female objectification present in previous roles is gone, turned on its head in fact--here 007 is the sexually objectified character.  This film lays the foundation of a much more interesting 007.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was such an amazing story. The tears I cried throughout; good and bad. The love story - the heartache; such an emotional roller coaster, but in such an incredible way. I highly recommend this book to everyone; even though it will make them cry, its definitely worth the read.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read Dr. Davis' book and found his argument credible.  Then I dropped sugary drinks and everything wheat.  Added omlettes, cheese, veggies, avocados, and dark chocolate.  Felt the absence of cravings, as predicted.  Shed twenty pounds in thirty days, weight I had carried for twenty years!  Feel better than ever! Enjoy eating now and finding it easy to stick with sensible portions. The wheat prohibition was just what I needed to find a better path. Also bought and read the Wheat Belly Cookbook.  Just learning to find how that fits in, mostly for fun and variety.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|this movie was awesome it was a very well created I like the movie all in all the action was very well
015204907X|4.0|This is a cute story. Involves counting and colors. The verse is rhyming, which attracts toddlers. Quality paper and materials.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Love the music of Josh Groban. It is the kind you sit back, relax and really enjoy.Love all but specialy 'If I walk away&#34;
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this for my 16-y/o son for Christmas, but both he and my 12-y/o daughter use it.  Compact, easy to carry, EASY TO SET UP, easy to use!!  I can't give a technical review like some of these other folks, but as the mother of a couple of serious gamers who like to take their games on the road - this is fabulous!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I AM TELLING YOU QUIT WASTING MONEY ON THIS. GO TO 4SHARED.COM TYPE IN MINECRAFT PE APK.... THEN DOWNLOAD YOU HAVE IT FOR FREE EASY RIGHT. SADLY I BOUGHT THE REAL VERSION BEFORE I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. REMEMBER THIS IS TECHICNALLY ILLEGAL SO HEADS UP.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Such great footage , especially the really early days of the Beatles in both Liverpool & Hamburg. A must own for Beatles fans.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I really like all the features this calculator has.  It seems to have something for everyone.  One useful thing that none of the other calculators have is the date functions.  It makes it easy to figure out time between dates.  Get this calculator and you won't ever need another one.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|A bit over-hyped, but they're worth it. Some songs fall short, but hey what disc today has 12 killer tracks on it?
B008N9AAQ4|3.0|If you loved Baraka and want more, this is for you.  If you want to see Baraka carried to the next level (like me), you will be disappointed.  If you have not seen Baraka, and only want to buy one, either one is just as good as the other and I would give either one five stars. I wanted Samsara to be the next evolution beyond Baraka so I was disappointed. To be fair, the images and music in Samsara are stunning.  The beauty and quality is every bit as wonderful as Baraka.  It has it's &#34;WOW!&#34; moments just like Baraka.  Therefore it is absolutely as good as Baraka but be aware is that it is more of the same.  In fact, you could probably show someone Baraka and Samara back to back or interchangeably and they could not tell the difference.  If that is what you want, I would give it five stars.  It is all in what you want.<br /><br />Note: if you want to play something on your Blu-ray/HDTV &#34;in the background&#34; during a party, even without sound - this or Baraka will captivate your guests.  Expect a crowd to form around the TV and people will ask, &#34;what is this?&#34;
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is worth the money! My son and I play it together and we love it! We highly recommend t.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|I love everything Jonathon Tropper writes-the language, the dialogue, ideas.  He's bawdy, crude,hilarious and wise.  I never expect a happy ending but it's okay to have one.  I loved all of the characters.  The gun scene was worth buying the book
0061730327|1.0|The background of this book put the inventiveness of the young people into perspective.  William<br />Kamkwamba's quest for solutions to his 'problems' was quite an odyssey.  His persistance, in the<br />face of unbelieveable odds is admirable.  (And that is an understatement!)
0062014536|5.0|In my review of the middle book, PANDEMONIUM, I said: \\"It's no secret to anyone who has read Oliver's books that she has a way with words. This is writing that can make you believe in anything.\\" That holds true here as well. See, I came into REQUIEM hoping for a certain outcome and even though that outcome didn't materialize, I left the book convinced that Lauren stayed true to her characters and that everything that happened developed organically.<br /><br />Let's talk about this: Who should Lena end up with? With Alex, the boy who first showed her what love is and with whom she shared an unparalleled sizzling chemistry in DELIRIUM? Or with Julian, the boy who discovered what love is thanks to her and who is sweet and awesome and completely won me over in PANDEMONIUM? Unlike in most YA triangles these days, it is not a clear or easy choice.<br /><br />But REQUIEM is not all about the boys - far from it. With the addition of Hana's POV (in alternating chapters with Lena's POV), we gain more insight on why Lena's fight with the resistance is so urgent. It's a testament to Lauren's skill as a writer that she is able to make Hana sympathetic despite some rather shocking revelations having to do with her. Although I was understandably more invested in Lena's story, Hana's parts were essential to fleshing out the world.<br /><br />Now that I've finished the series, I'm itching to go back and start reading it all over again - and really - what higher praise is there?
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The thing with this book is... it's not really a good book, it's adequete, but that's about it. Characters lack depth, all of them look like a copy of someone else's book. And it feels like things happen without meaning. Despite everything I just wrote for some reason I kept on reading it, it's kind of addictive reading, but for all the wrong reasons.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl took me through the loops of emotion as I learned more and more about the characters! I couldn't decide if I wanted to love them or despise them. The unexpected twists and turns made this hard to put down.  I want a sequel!!!! I want to find out how it really ends!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a cool game for horse lovers like myself. A bit addicting at times. Its just too bad its hard to gain those gems but its fun regardless. I would recommend it, especially since its free.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator app for me! Thanks it works perfectly and does exactly what I want it to!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|If you liked Farmville or Yoville back in the days, then you'll like this game.  It's also less maintenance than those other games too.
B00008HCCF|5.0|Norah Jones has one of those great sultry voices, excellent for late night relaxing to or just chilling; this is a great album.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very addicting and really fun but we finished the game in a couple of weeks.  Not sure if there's an update to add more levels.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is clearly some of the most High Grade 3-D CGI that has ever graced the screen. In my humble opinion, Best movie of 2012!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I find myself astonished that we couldn't sit through a movie with Denzel Washington. Had we known it was going to be an excruciatingly boring flick about a man's trials with substance abuse, peppered with horribly-developed unnecessary back-stories, we never would have shelled-out the money to rent this flick. The opening scene of some naked flight attendant prancing around in front of the camera during Denzel's phone argument with an ex-wife was absolutely unnecessary and, quite frankly, if I was a woman, I'd be offended. It did nothing for the movie. The crash scene was very good, but the movie completely \\"crashed\\" after that. We watched about 2/3 of the movie desperately hoping it would pick-up, then ultimately put something else on and fell asleep. Just like this movie.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I liked just as much as the first one. For awhile I thought Ethan and Lena not getting back together thouhh
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed the book.Held my attention and left me wanting to read more. I hope to read her other book s soon.You
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A serious page turner. I can't wait to read the next. So many surprises and new information in each chapter that will keep you on the edge of your seat. A must read.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Aspects of this film were shocking and disturbing. The way sobriety was created with a passing out and collapsing drunk was unbelievably surprising. Denzel plays this part as he does all roles that he undertakes with true believability.<br />A strong and disturbing drama.
0345803493|5.0|The x-rated was a little verbose but did enjoy it and the story.  It is a nice break from reality.

B0017SWPXY|4.0|I was surprised by my love for this book, it's emotional and lovely! A great book for a couple to share.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The series still continues to impress us. It may be a kids book, but it was enough to catch my attention.
B009KNPNT6|4.0|I basically purchased this for the live CD that came with this package and it doesn't dissapoint. Live versions of Steady Rollin' Man , I Shot the Sheriff and Badge being the highlights for me.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|worth the price which is so little for so much.  excellent and functional, love it.  also you can see everything clearly, even without reading glasses, not that I need them! :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched all three seasons of Downton in three weeks.  I'm all caught up and NOW I know what all the hype is about!  WATCH IT!
B008VDJFFY|5.0|Brilliant read, couldn't put it down its nice to have a love story with a twist. Wouldn't expect anything else!
0316228532|1.0|I was shocked after I finished the bookmthat this came out of such a brilliant writer. I love, love her and Harry Potter. But this was just a book with too much going on, bad story and a horrible ending. Hopemthe next one will be better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another excellent read from Colleen Hoover, really fell in love with the characters and has an excellent storyline. looking forward to the next one!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It works great. I can color code my notes for each event I am doing. That makes it easier to keep the all together. It was easy you use and has a calendar.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like minecraft but it costs too much can you please lower the price to at least 1.00 roller like its the best game in earth
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a free app. It adds, and subtracts, and multiplies, and divides. What more could you want from a calculator? Well this one can also do square roots!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its fun to play. very addictive. i like the objectives. but the app crashes and I have to reinstall and lose my progress.
B003WJQ74E|3.0|I thought the premise was interesting (a retarded man has an operation which turns him into an unhappy, cynical, and friendless genius, only to revert back to idiocy in less than a year) but the writing is amateurish.<br /><br />It's a good idea that could've become a great classic in the hands of a more skilled writer.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because it's supposed to be for a teenage-reading level but I still think it could use a lot of editing. There are way too many extra sentences. That's like dumbing down the book and hitting the reader over the head trying to get the point across when the point has already been made sufficiently. Simply put, there are a lot of cases of showing and not telling.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season yet. This is a spectacular show. To be honest as impressed as I was with the first few episodes I couldn't fathom how the writers would keep the horrors fresh without devolving into formulaic carnage. But it's the depth and complexity of the characters that make each loss, each attack, each triumph meaningful. Doing that with zombies as a backdrop would seem an impossible task, but somehow the writers and actors have accomplished it.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Bought this for my brother and his wife as a gift as they are big fans of the program. So now they can watch it anytime and anywhere they want - they loved it!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|it is cool and awesome because you can shoot the piggies with the birds. I rate it a 4 out of 5
1451673442|5.0|Love this book.  I read it and reread it often.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in this type of information.
B00AAQVPYO|5.0|Great Jazz fusion album. Shows the genius that was Frank Zappa. It is a timeless compilation of music. Couldn't wait to purchase it on Amazon.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|While I'm working when the new episodes come on, I look so forward to getting the updates on this one.<br /><br />After 5 seasons, I was wondering if the chemistry of the characters would still be intact. I'm more than happy to say YES, it is.<br /><br />I was late coming into this series, but once I started, I was hooked. The character growth ( or lack of in some cases ) are what in my opinion makes this a complete hit.<br /><br />I've purchased the previous seasons and have watched them over and over, and to this day, I still laugh out loud, even at the first episode.<br /><br />If you're a fan of great comedy, then this is a must have...
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This book was really good with a twist and sad ending and her parents banned her from ever see him again

B0058A119G|5.0|I have love listening to Barbra Streisand sing for years.  Her voice and the length that she can hold a note is truly gifted.  I enjoy this CD with songs that were written years ago.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a very addictive game. Having a blast playing it on my kindle fire hd. Well worth the price.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I received this as a gift. While being excited by the prospect of having super colorful patterns on my bike wheel, I was intimidated by the circuit board and installation. It sat for over a month with me looking at it and then walking away. Yesterday I decided to attempt to install it. It installed so easily that I felt utterly foolish for waiting so long! Anyone can install this easily!<br /><br />At dusk the lights on the brightest setting were clearly visible. Later at night the lights were simply stunning. You do have to be moving fairly fast to see the pattern crisply but the lights are still bright and pretty at slower speeds. The Wheel Light also has the happy side effect of illuminating the area around the wheel in an unobtrusive way so you can actually see what is around you on the ground. The weight of the battery pack and the board didn't unbalance my bicycle at all.<br /><br />The settings, instructions and button operations are super easy to understand. The website support is comprehensive, with videos of how to install the lights, guides and manuals. [...]<br /><br />The best part of the wheel light is that it makes you positively, unfailingly visible. You WILL be noticed and seen at night. Maybe not the best thing to have if you're a ninja, but for us non-ninjas the MonkeyLectric M210 is truly spectacular.<br /><br />No I don't work for the company that makes it. I'm just someone who is delighted by having such a positive and illuminating experience with a product that works better than I had ever expected!<br /><br />Thank you MonkeyLectric! &lt;3<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Easy Install<br />• Great directions<br />• Crazy bright LEDs<br />• High visibility when biking at night<br />• Fun! Suitable patterns for both guys and girls<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Have to be moving fairly fast to see the pattern crisply<br />• Too attention grabbing for ninjas to use
B001JRB16U|5.0|Condition seems fine. One of my favorite movies since childhood. Replacing our damaged VHS copy for our kids to watch.
B000LC4ZF8|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my cousin, who remembers watching this as a child.  It's as fun now as it was then!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The fifty shades trilogy is an entertaining and excellent read.  It really took me by surprise, as it wasn't what I expected.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  I was disappointed with this season's finale, but the show is spectacular. Highly recommend this series.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is so awesome! I just love having full control of all my PCs from anywhere. This app puts your PCs right on your smartphone or tablet. I have other apps that claim to do what this one does but they fall short. You've got to get this app. It's by far the best remote desktop out there. You're going to love it just like I do. Have a nice day.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Enjoyed this movie with my family. The movie was action filled and entertaining! I would recommend this movie to my friends!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This story finally gives us permission to let go of defined religious and spiritual practices and just allow. Must read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't want it to end.  But a great ending it was!  Katniss was finally the hero and learned to live like a human being not the pawn she thought she was.
1616550414|5.0|I've been wondering whether to but this for a few months now. I finally bought it, and am very pleased.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This was a very dark book; interesting story and true to Gillian Flynns' style; the ending kept you guessing. I didn't much relate to any character, and I found it a bit depressing to read.
B001L51RQE|4.0|perfect ..<br />un po lenti nella spedizione<br />imballo perfetto<br />consigliato<br />molto disponibili e veloci nel aiutarti se si ha dei problemi
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I decided to read Gillian Flynn's other books as I loved Girl Gone so much. This was an interesting story, but very dark and I didn't find myself &#34;enjoying&#34; it.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I liked this book it was not too much or too little in the romance and action department. I was ready for it to be more Fifty Shades but this is nothing like that. It has a good story and romance and they dont even have sex, but you can feel the love they both feel.  Looking forward to the next novel that succeeds this one.
0553801473|5.0|A lot of people complain about this book being slow or boring.  True, not much happens in this book.  However, I'm assuming that a lot of the information in A Dance with Dragons will be important for book 6.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I so enjoy this movie I bought it for my kindle and NEVE get tired of watching it or laughing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever invented!!!!!! My first time playing I loved it so much! Play this game it is amazing!!!!!!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Hooked on it.  Can't wait to begin the other seasons.  Would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a suspenseful drama.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|At first i found the game hard.  But once i got the hang of it i love playing. Having multiple landing areas in free play would be nice.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|it's intriguing and challenging without the stress of timed games.<br />great visuals and side games that are fun and relevant to the game.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|solid game. decent graphics. fun gameplay. all around a solid game that hasn't given me any problems. knock on wood.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Bought for someone else and they like it.<br />I have nothing else to say about it as it<br />is notsomething I use.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun game, easy to play.  Kids like it as well.  Graphics are also good.  What else can I say about it
0307702103|5.0|we not only love the legal dramas that Mr. Grisham writes, we love the comedy in his writing as well.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Not much to say! It's a free app that runs well on my android tablet and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was quite pleasantly surprised by this novel. From the first scenes, the imagery captured my attention. The plot contained just the right balance of suspense, action, romance and trickery that I was completely glued to the story the entire time. I also loved the warning of what could become that underscores the story.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|What an excellent product! I thoroughly enjoyed this and would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Downton Abbey. The quality of the blu ray discs is outstanding and Amazon was very prompt in filling the order.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I think season 3 is not as exciting as season 1 and 2. I hate they keep killing off main characters I like. Not sure I like the new characters they are bringing on now. Hopefully it will pick up and move faster now. I am only on episode 4 so I am sure it will get better. Still a great show though!!!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great movie..!  Washington was fantastic in role. Supporting cast was great. Definitely worth having in one's movie library. On the edge of my seat, even after the flight sequences.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Chasing Mavericks Movie Review<br /><br />Truth be told, when the movie trailer for \\"Chasing Mavericks\\" was released I was far from eager to spend $12 dropping into a movie theater to watch it.<br /><br />Guess I'm a bit jaded by major motion pictures in the past that have failed to capture the art/sport of surfing in its true form.<br />Need I mention \\"Blue Crush\\" or \\"Soul Surfer?\\"<br /><br />Fast-forward to February 26, 2013 the date \\"Chasing Mavericks\\" comes out on DVD, and my \\"corporate\\" surf movie mindset is forever shifted.<br /><br />It's apparent that this movie was \\"made with the help of some of the biggest names in the surfing world.\\" I believe it was thru these collaborative efforts that 20th Century Fox succeeded in communicating the feelings only a surfer would know.<br /><br />The movie was more than just about big wave surfing, it's about life transforming moments and creating a legacy. \\"Chasing Mavericks\\" is the \\"Karate Kid\\" of surfing.  In this instance, Frosty Hesson plays the part of Mr. Miyagi and Jay Moriarity is Danielson.<br /><br />This is not just a movie you watch once and forget about it. It's a movie you add to your DVD collection and revisit time and time again. As the opening clip reminds us; \\" We all came from the sea,but we are not of the sea. Children of the tides must return to it again and again.\\"<br /><br />Slyde into a Surf Movie worth a watch! Share with us your feedback.<br />[...]<br />Article By : Michelle Michalak
0547884591|5.0|I recently took on some cooking responsibilities. I hated it. I felt like some mindless programmed person who reads a recipe, looks on the shelf to see if he has the ingredients, buys the missing ones at the store, comes home, follows all the directions, puts it on the table, eats, then washes the dishes. I bought several cook books and all follow the same boring process. What can be fun about that? Then I read the 4 Hour Chef. It really contains interesting stuff and breaks free of all the copy cat crap. I leave 4 Hour Chef on my coffee table and it has inspired others. I don't read it like other cookiing books (start at page 1, go to page 2, go to page 3, go to sleep). I just open the book at random. I have only used one recipe, the one for Osso Bucco, I didn't follow it but used it as a general guide, made the dish with camel meat, invited a Saudi, a Portlander, and a San Francisco person over for dinner and we had a great time. 4 Hour Chef represents liberation from drudgery and boredom.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|can't wait to see the movie<br />I love Nicholas Sparks books and movies they are the best<br />thank you very much
B008VBYN80|4.0|when I got this app it WAS fun but the problem was the gems and recruiting them I doubt with only two people one time vs three and one guy on a horse. :(
B008CP6RWU|3.0|i just don't get it.  but then again, the game demon souls and dark souls already exposed me to the type of experience that this game has to offer but did it better.  that may be it.  bonding through hardship kinda thing.  i don't know how so many people can label this as such a breakthrough game but me not feeling that way about it.  i was waiting for the game to evolve into something that would blow my mind but didn't happen.  i didn't dislike the game either and was worth the 14.99 i paid for through ps3 store.<br />i'm going to try playing the game again and i'll update if i've missed something.
B009RH973I|5.0|I bought this for some extra protection for my little ones Kindle. It is perfect and light weight. We enjoy it.
B009EP3DJM|4.0|i abosoultly love the quality of this cd it came with no scratches and all in its wrappers. i love listening to it in my car if u love kesha this is a must
B00992CF6W|4.0|it was a very good app but dosnt have allthe controls the origanal has. but if you do want a cheap version like i did you should realy buy it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it I am on a daily reading plan. I allso read a new Bible verse every day, and I am reading a daily devotional by Joice Myer.I have read four devotional allready
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I definitely give Toca Hair Salon 2 5 stars (and would give it more if I could!) because it keeps my girls entertained for long periods of time. It is fun and educational! Even my newly 2 year old can play it perfectly. She can scroll through the options, pick the tools she wants and get to the main menu to choose different characters. ***I love giving my 4 year old daughter and 5 year old niece challenges with this game. I will do a characters hair a certain way and tell them what to do to see if they can follow the directions. For example, I will give one of the girls short, straight, black hair and tell them she wants long blond curly hair with a bow and glasses, and see if they follow the instructions. It is even entertaining for me! The only thing is that I wish there were updates to it every now and again to change it up. New characters, accessories, etc. But overall, I am very impressed with this game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The way Suzanne shaped this book caused me to be unable to our it down. Around every corner was suspense and I can't wait to read the second one.
B00705GEP8|5.0|Another awesome album by the band. The limited edition version is probably the nicest Cd I've ever owed. Get this Cd
0385341008|5.0|I listened to this book & loved hearing the 20 different voices of the characters.  I highly recommend this method of 'listening' to this book vs. reading it.  However, I would ALSO love to read it & often wished I had a printed copy of the book in my hands.  Simply knowing how to spell the characters names, or flip back to a favorite passage, were things I missed in the listening.  Interesting contrast.  The story is so creatively cast.  There are brilliant twists & heart wrenching aspects.  I know you will treasure this book after either listening to it or reading it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this rating ( 5 stars ) because this is the best book that I've ever read in my life. I loved the wording, and the suspense. I recommend this book to people that love Romance, Jeff Kinney books and a good laugh.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|I don't imagine this is for everyone, however, I enjoyed the first season.  The acting was done well and the stories were not predictable.  Good entertainment.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Streep is in her element in this film but Tommy Lee Jones was an unexpected treat. I couldn't get enough of this film. It was really underrated when it came out and that's a shame.
B000ZN802W|5.0|My son saw this movie so I decided to watch it! It's prolific and compelling and it's a movie about people and how we meet people for a purpose to get through our journey of life.  My son and I watched it together and it's a good movie for young adults tring to find themselves in the face paced world.  I highly reccomend.
B003UYUR0G|4.0|Would recommend it. Have to say more...Have to say more...Have to say more...Have to say more...Have to say more...Have to say more...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this one is awesome! it is waaaaay better than the first one. even if you did not like the first one, try it. it's awesome!
B009MF56GC|4.0|Everybody, ev...ery...bo...dy was hamming it up in this movie. It was great.  Not as serious as the first which made it that much better.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This CD is truly one of Josh Groban's best to date.  His vocals are truly excellent, and the choice of new material and his interpretation on some older material covered by other artists in the past,  is just excellent.  I could listen to it over and over again.  And I do!  If you like Josh Groban, you must purchase this CD.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This is the best Bond movie yet.  Gone are the un-realistic gadgets and hokie Roger Moore lines.  This move is gritty and action pact.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Multiple calculators for the price of one! I got it for free (AOD). But (now that I have used it), can honestly say, I would be happy having paid $9.99 (regular) price.  As one reviewer points out, imagine what this multiple calculator would have cost to purchase as a separate device.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Though a bit disconcerting to start with the past and present mingled together...it is a page turner ! Read with the lights on
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Sir prance a lot is so much fun, there are lots of different sounds, his feet crinkle and his head rings,  his rings rattle,  he has lots of nooks and crannies for a babies hand to grab onto the toy.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|was probably a pretty good movie, but the closed caption was very bad,and it had to reload five times,dont know why never have problems like that with netflix
B008B3MZMY|5.0|Just for Supertramp fans! An original recording of the legendary concert. It is a different day from the CD, that gives a plus. The bonus videos are just a photo video composition (not live videos; live music), but it's OK. Good packaging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is really fun. It helps you learn about how a horse is taking care of. My Horse teaches you on how expensive it can be to take care of it.
0345536886|5.0|This book is a perfect gift for a  John Grisham fan or for an introduction to a great, well-written book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it has very good quality sound effects OK but pretty cool game. but personally I highly recommend it. I like it
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Very well written. You can tell Isaacson made a great research. Strongly recommended for Apple-lovers and for people interested in business. For all the business strategies described, reading it has been like a mini MBA.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|This case is absolutely amazing nice sleek casing to the phone and protects my phone well its like an otterbox but thinner :) Would definitely consider this to people who have an iphone 5
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|but a worth while time killer if you have nothing else to do but rent a movie. Could have<br />been better.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|The movie is 1 hour 48 minutes long. It's boring right from the beginning and until the very end of the movie! Characters are unlikable, not one of them was making the movie worth watching! The story is awful. Boring dialogue, sexually explicit content that was as well just disgusting. I liked nothing. What could I like? Whores? Scumbag character(s)? I expected something futuristic from the movie. Well we got pretty computer displays in the car which took around 80% of the movie. The whole movie you can well say was in the car. That's about it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing and not for those who wish not to cry aloud when reading.<br />The author delves deep into the heart and soul, asking questions often not uttered out loud, and forces the reader to view living and dying and living while dying in a wonderful way.<br />I laughed, cried, pondered, laughed more and cried til I thought my heart would burst, but it was worth it.<br />Highly Recommended d f t b a
B001Q94TQA|5.0|A non-traditional love story set to heartfelt music.  If you enjoyed the Broadway musical, this is a must-see! 2007 Academy Award winner for Best Original Song, &#34;Falling Slowly&#34;.
B008SOS63S|4.0|If all this album contained was MIDNIGHT BLUES, BIRD ON A WIRE, and DOWN AROUND MY PLACE, it would still be worth the price.  These songs are stunners and show how transcendant Joe's music can be when he goes beyond standard blues and blues rock.  I'm not a big fan of the Beth Hart stuff, but the Paul Rodgers stuff doesn't hurt at all.  The rest is pretty good and consistant, especially Joe's own classics like BLUE AND EVIL and DUST BOWL.  If you are new to Joe's music and curious (as I was one year ago) this is the place to start.  I bought the DVD first, and I had to get this one when it came out, and if you buy this I'll bet you'll want the DVD.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I have Hulu but it didn't have the beginning of this show and I wanted to start from the beginning... so I reluctantly paid for the first few episodes and now am TOTALLY hooked! I knew I'd like the show but it is interesting and I usually don't like DC vs. Marvel as much, w/the made up cities and more depressing primary characters but this show is fun and interesting. I look forward to it every week!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This dictionary sucks<br />Worse than any. Thing he style<br />Gta version vice city stories is better<br />The day fighter created gangnam
0345803485|5.0|Loved every minute of it! Enough romance and drama combined. Hope they make the movie. Check out The Cross Fire Series if you liked this series.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book in the series moved slow. It took me way too long to finish it, but the last 35 pages were full of action and I couldn't put the book down. Overall the series was great. Unpredictable and shocking twists. I would recommend this to others!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great book. It has enough humor, but yet enough mystery. Loved it and can't wait to see the movie now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Enjoy the game so far only played it for ten minutes.  It is relaxing and fun to play even mom and dad will like to play
B005FVNIW6|5.0|It gets better and better every time I read it. Last time was 15 years ago and it has stayed with me ever since.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Without spoiling things I must say that this ending for season three was EPIC!  With a season so full of ups and downs and to think of all that is now ending in this too short, they are all too short :)episode.  The characters have grown and to see them interact with a new household is very interesting. The ending left me stunned, so have a box of tissues ready.  Now the waiting game until season 4 begins.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This wasn't as good as the previous couple (Fever Dream and Cemetary Dance were great), but you gotta read 'em all, right?
B008J34466|5.0|Pink has plenty to say and she puts it out there, right at you, in her own style, and I like it!
B0082GQ5HG|4.0|Love the movie. The 3D effects are stunning. The humor in this movie might not be suitable for little children, though. But, I enjoyed the movie very much.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can you say about a lady with an amazing voice.  True she needs to give it a rest when it comes to singing about love lost, but I guess you have to start somewhere and selling millions of albums tells me that she must be doing something right.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Doesn't disappoint. Very interesting to read the viewpoint of someone who abuses his wife as well. Great read, would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks books.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this a lot, love the rain ones, very soothing and I like that I can set the time so it is not on all night.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so muck I went a whole day without eating, drinking, or using the bathroom. SOOOOOOOOOO FREAkin  FUNNNNNN
B004ZQBOXC|1.0|I thought it would be cool, but it is not. I hate every stupid song on this dumb cd. tooooooooot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game.  It really makes you think. It is good for my kids too.  I don't worry about them playing mindless games when they are playing this.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As with all of Mr. Clancy's books I have read this flows very well.  Easy to follow the plot and characters.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|There are many reasons we did not like this movie. First of all the direction and the soundtrack are just dismal. There is no cohesion in the plot; first you are wondering what on earth is going on and then you're wondering why on earth am I watching this in the first place. However most importantly, we find the use of Quentin Tarantino's name immensely misleading as he had nothing to do with this film at all in terms of direction, writing, producing, etc. It is painfully obvious that RZA had nothing to show for his own skills and that if he hadn't attached Tarantino's name to his movie's intro, no one would have wanted to watch it. Secondly, he casts himself in the lead role and he uses his own music which does not fit the movie atmosphere one bit. It is a horrible self-serving waste of time and disgrace to the film industry. We mourn the loss of our measly $5.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is cute. Nice graphics and you can move between screens relatively quickly. Overall nice game and nice for kids.
0920668372|5.0|Though no fault of the shipper, it was bend when put into my mail box. I purchased this book for a second time for my son who is now 20 years old.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|it is not at all laggy it is very good and very very fun even blowing up is very very fun!!!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Being a Red Sox fan, I loved the trivia mentioned in the movie. Clint plays a believable character, as usual.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I read this book in two days. It was a phenomenally written story. I feel like I know the characters intimately and am wondering what happens to them next. The story played like a movie in my mind. It evoked emotions including a few tears. I hope Ms Diffenbaugh is working on adding to this story.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Best show on television.  The storyline continuelly surprises me with unexpected twists.  I love the connectivity of the upstairs and downstairs characters.  Let it last forever.
B005PK56TA|5.0|It is filmed well, the actors are fantastic and it is definitely very dark. There is an underlying humor to it that makes it fun to watch. I watched them all in quick succession.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film is a quirky yet beautiful love story between two outcast 12 year olds. Each scene is set up like a painting with bright colors and images that pop off of the screen. This film is brilliant from beginning to end.
B00005JKNF|5.0|There are so many layers to this film - the guests, the house, the rigid manners of the day, and the motives from each of the guests at the shooting party.  This film is under-appreciated for its style and wit - don't let this one get away from you!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this!!  Challenging--but not impossible!  Great story line...Great imagery...Great game!  I hope Alawar creates a sequel--or at least--more games this awesome!
B0006A9FMI|5.0|There is really an issue with the english subtitles on this DVD. But for me, I got used to it after a while.<br />It can be anoying though!<br />So please think about it first.<br />But the anime is great!<br />If you can't find another edition, or can't afford it, buy this one!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice game for horse lovers or someone trying to find a new way to waste time. Training and horse upkeep is pretty simple.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I use this bag for my power wheelchair. It' works fine on the arm. I have the use of only one arm.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|The first time I saw the stage production of Les Miserables, I was blown away. I had never loved a musical before and I didn't expect this one to be any different. But it WAS different. Almost every line was sung making it almost more like an opera, which I had never been a huge fan of either, but something about Les Miserables grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I have been a huge fan of it ever since, right down to owning 2 different versions of the soundtrack, the London Cast recording AND the Broadway Cast recording, both of which have areas and performances that exceed the other (hence the reason for owning both).<br /><br />So I was very hesitantly excited about this movie version. It had some great actors attached, but could those actors sing? It was rumored to be faithful to the stage version, including the long running time, but how well would that transfer to film?<br /><br />After having finally seen it in it's last week in theaters, I can say with some relief that I very much enjoyed it, but I didn't quite love it as much as I hoped I would (although I suspect my admiration will increase slightly upon repeated viewings now that I've read some interviews and watched some \\"making of\\" videos). There were some things that held it back from greatness, but still managed to allow it to meet my expectations in certain areas and even exceed them in others.<br /><br />The stage production is really fundamentally about the singing. I mean, the sets and costumes are great, but not everyone is close enough to see the emotion through facial expressions so it has to be conveyed in the song. But a movie is full of close ups and expressions become very important, and a movie would get boring very quickly if the only expression on the actors face in every scene is \\"eyes closed, mouth wide open\\". So there has to be a little give and take in translating this to film.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly excellent, no complaints. The power and emotion of various scenes are easily conveyed by the strength and skill of the actors, but not always by the strength and conviction of their singing. Hugh Jackman is an excellent example of this. His performance is fantastic, he plays the role extremely well and is able to make you feel both his suffering and his joy by his ability as an actor, but his singing, while commendable, is far from overwhelming. The fact that the songs were recorded live during filming so the actors could set the tone of the scene, as opposed to being recorded in a sound booth and dubbed into the film later, adds to the power of the scene but detracts from the power of the song. Give and take.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway has received a lot of attention for her portrayal of Fantine, all of which is very much deserved. She truly earned each and every award she's won. But I also have to give special accolades to Eddie Redmayne for his performance of \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\", which is my absolute favorite song in Les Miserables, and in my opinion is the 2nd strongest performance after Anne's \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\".<br /><br />I've listened to the London and Broadway recordings dozens of times each, but I don't think the soundtrack to this movie will hold up as well without the added visuals since so much of the actual power behind the scenes lies in the actors \\"physical\\" performance and presence, although I will probably still buy it even if just for a few certain songs.<br /><br />Overall the review on Blu-ray.com sums up my feelings about the film almost perfectly. All those things I couldn't quite put my finger on are explained very well there, but in the end I also agree with the reviewer that this film largely succeeds in spite of these things and I have every intention of buying it and watching it over and over again because a few key scenes are absolutely amazing enough to justify it.conveyed by the strength and skill of the actors, but not always by the strength and conviction of their singing.

B002QHH22O|5.0|Although they are making fun of Hair Metal bands of the 80s, the songwriting is awesome. They get you to think of a certain song without outright ripping it off and just changing lyrics. Tunes are really catchy. If you can handle their trademark raunchy lines, it is well worth it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love the ease of ordering music online and just downloading it immediately. We get instant gratification and do not have to drive around town to all the stores to find it.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Not the best movie, but i did like it. It was slow to get going. There were a few things which probably could have been done differently which which have made the beginning better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best tv series drama i've seen recently. The actors, sets and screenplay is simply amazing. Also love the production quality.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|good game. challenging but enjoyable puzzles. only complaint was how rushed the ending felt. overall a good story and fun game to play.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|honestly I just got it thinking it was going to be lame but boy was I wrong. it's dealt cool and works real well for the kindle fire plus I can put my music on there to play every morning!
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I buy this, and I can't watch it on my TV? No HDMI or Apple TV support??? Then, it won't let me return it??? I'll NEVER EVER buy from this crappy service again. EVER. Hulu+, Netflix, iTunes, ALL of them support the basic protocols.  This is a complete and total rip off. Buyer beware. Amazon Prime clearly means Amazon CROOKS!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Plenty of songs~good variation.  Great sound I play it at least once a week!! As it is a live recording, there is the crowd noise and cheers~but still worth it!

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I really like his movies.. the town was pretty good. This movie diserved the best picture. honestly it is better than the zero dark thirty because this was more edge of your seat type of deal.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|This is fast action story easy to read. The clear descriptions make picturing the areas very easily. A good read when you want to escape.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Great quality and beautiful. I love the antique journal look. I love it so much I bought a second as a back up.
B005NK69ZC|4.0|A . funny and enjoyable book even though I had read it before still enjoyed reading it again.  Thanks Ellen.
0062014536|5.0|My Thoughts: I really enjoyed reading Requiem but not quite as much as the other two. We are back with Lena and her crew out in the Wilds. And half the book is spent on Hana's point of view. Yes, folks it switches back and forth between viewpoints.<br /><br />Alex and Julian are both in the picture and Lena has some tough choices and roads ahead of her. I liked seeing both boys in the story but I felt like there just wasn't enough romance. It wasn't as love trianglely as I thought it would be, which I'm sure some will like but I wanted more chemistry and more romance.<br /><br />I really liked Hana's point of view. I liked exploring her mind and what she was thinking. She wasn't perfect and she had a lot of negative thoughts and she wasn't as tame as her husband thought. Go Hana!<br /><br />I liked exploring the Wilds but at times I wanted to know more. I felt like I really was in the woods with Lena but sometimes it was hard to actually identify where they were and I wanted to know and understand more of \\"where\\" they were. And than people out to kill them, ouch, they always had to be on the lookout. They could never let their guard down, even for a minute.<br /><br />I liked all the side characters just like in the other books. We get to see more of their personalities and who they really were. Throw in some new competition for Lena, and things can go haywire alright.<br /><br />And she runs into the person she thought she wouldn't, her mother. Now, that was interesting.<br /><br />As for the plot. Liked it. They just want freedom, to be able to make their own choices, to be able to love.<br /><br />As for Julian and Alex, gosh, I like both boys. Can Lena just be with them both? I know, I know, she can't.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more, because I don't want to give anything away. You need to experience this one by yourself since you've already read the first two and are probably anxiously wanting this one! So, go read it now and decide your own opinions!<br /><br />Overall: Liked it alot. Probably more of a 4.5 but I'm giving it a 5 anyway. I loved Oliver's others and I'm sure I'll love the next one. Love the style of writing and the way she writes characters.<br /><br />Cover: Like it! I think I like it a little less than the others though but its still cool.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br />______<br />Taken From Princess Bookiebr /><br />Overall: Liked it alot.

B001NHNG64|5.0|Just finished the second Jack Reacher book. What a ride! Can't wait to start the third. Pure action all the way! A good read.
B004H83IG4|3.0|This tale is really sloooooooow in the first third and then it picks up some. Inspired by the accused murdered, Robert Durst.<br /><br />Gosling plays a wealthy man named Mark who marries a working class girl named Katie (played by Kirsten Dunst). Their marriage begins with promise but his unstable mood swings create friction to the point where we are left wondering did he murder her or not?<br /><br />Arguably too many flashbacks and back stories did damage to the tale.<br /><br />That said it had its moments in which some scenes were done well, especially when the Dunst character is trying to get certain information from her husband's office.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $20M but it didn't even clear $1M at the Box Office. I'm not terribly surprised.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2012 to January 2013 (streamed).
B001EOOC3W|4.0|For Britten lovers, this box set provides experience with his vast number of  compositions, including songs, chamber music, opera, orchestral.  Not a lot of Britten/Pears recordings, as they mostly were done by Decca.  This shows how deeply brilliant his work is,  in the hands of many other great interpreters.
0062082353|5.0|A very informative and compelling story by a true American hero. He always sacrificed and put his fellow soldiers' safety front and center. It’s a tragedy that he was taken from us recently.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This movie was hilarious. My whole family loved it. The kids and grown ups enjoyed it. I definitely recommend everyone to watch it.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I'm attracted to rock and roll biographies/autobiographies.  This one was one of my favorites.  The structure of the book fantastic...Nikki shares entries from his actual diaries, then there's commentary by various people involved in his life during the time the entries were written.  The back-and-forth really works.  Made for a quick read.  Loved the book.
B004SBX112|5.0|just downright addicting... Physics, geometry, math... who said we wouldn't use those in daily life? This game's got it all, and it's all well-disguised in a very fun game.

0307346617|5.0|Great zombie book. Some may be turned off by the 'Interview-Style' writing, but I thought it was well done. More like a collection of Zombie short stories. Some of these stories do make references to events in other stories, so it is tied in a little bit
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it is an ok APP, except there should be more interactive care tasks, other wise it's fun. My personal favorite part is the competitions, they are the best part of the APP, and then there's dressing your horse and getting pics too.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is so cool. The 3D makes it super. Great movie. Would highly recommend this. Such a great story.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|The stock Android calculator has always left something to be desired for me.  It's a great simple app for small calculations, but anything much more than 2+2 and you either have to turn the phone landscape to get those functions, or it doesn't have them at all.  There are several more advanced calculators in Play and I've tried a few, but this one has been the best to use.<br /><br />For starters, you access different functions/calculator layouts by swiping horizontally.  An excellent way to handle that feature, IMHO.  Then there is the sheer bewildering number of options and features.  The conversion calculators are a nice touch and very easy to use as are the page of common constants.  You get a stack and registers you can control, and if you don't like the way something works, there's probably a setting to change it.  In general, it feels like the developers scanned and uploaded a real scientific calculator into an app.<br /><br />Overall, the last calculator I'll ever need.

B00000K3D4|5.0|Perfect for a nostalgic trip down memory lane! Lovely Bowie, scary creatures and a happy end, what more could one ask for?
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Unfortunately the term 'easy read' usually denotes dross or carries an innate assumption that it will appeal to a partially brain-dead reader. I mean, though, that it's 'easy' because it scans so well: the interest factor is high, it's not a formulaic style,plus it contains both humour and sharp ideas.<br />The humour is character driven. The male lead role has a good line in self aware and self-deprecating home truths about himself. The 'heroine' of the story, conversely, has a magic eye for deliciously scathing summations of the flaws she perceives in those around her. Very smart and presented in a manner that misleads the reader from initial assumptions as they pursue the crisp gait of the story. Sort of read a body feels lucky to kick back with
B0017O1MIM|5.0|What a stupendous pressing of this title. It's taken a hell of a long time but the wait has been WELL worth it.
B005LA3Z9M|3.0|Three stars for keeping me engaged right till the end. The sort of novel you feel<br />may be going to have some real meat to it. It transpires that this shines more as an uptown Mills and Boon than as a novel that contains any new thoughts or depth of insight. I kept thinking it was going to be more than it turned out to be. Once I had finished reading it, I realised I felt somewhat let down. With the apparent new angle (the flower language idea teased me into believing a more original story would unfold) it was disappointing that The Language of Flowers was a one trick pony with regard to ideas.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a fun little game to pass the time. For being a free game, it certainly surpassed my expectations. Great one for the kids
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really loved this memoir. I am not typically into books in this genre, but I learned about Chris Kyle when he was on the reality show \\"Stars Earn Stripes.\\" I was really touched by the accounts in this book. He is real about everything and every detail of his deployments. I also really liked the fact that his wife Taya writes her thoughts throughout the book. Taya, my thoughts and prayers are with you--your husband was an incredible man.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|This long movie is probably good, but the sound was so awful we could not understand a word. And we rented the hd version just to enjoy the sound. We tried everything, from subtitles (which amazon does not have) to changing every aspect of our receiver for the ceiling speakers and subwoofer.<br />The quality of the video was not good either. We were very dissapointed. We never have this issues with netflix but it seems recurring with amazon on demand.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Best book EVER!!!  I loved it. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading it.
B009G3T01M|5.0|The music is great, but the substance of many of the tracks brings a rare, thoughtful theme.  This version is edited, but some of the tracks (such as the Caddy song) may want to be skipped if you listen to the tracks in the presence of kids.

B004GXZ69W|5.0|Some things you should know about me:<br /><br />1. I have arthritis in my hands.<br />2. I can almost always be found at my computer.<br />3. I love online gaming (MMO's).<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago my arthritis hit a horrible high. My mouse hand (right hand) was swollen between the knuckles of my middle finger and ring finger. I was alternating hot and cold packs for hours, taking ibuprofen, using icy hot. All of that helped but didn't get rid of the issue. It didn't get rid of the issue because I still need to hold my mouse!<br /><br />I had a MS mouse. It was a good and even expensive mouse. In fact, I've found it a new home because it was too good/valuable to just toss. But the positioning of my arthritic hand was causing me SEVERE pain.<br /><br />I was slightly familiar with this type of mouse because I'd done some temp work for a well known online medical presence and this is the style of mouse they get for their employees who have issues. I figured, if *they* use them, knowing the cost, that says a lot to me.<br /><br />So I came to Amazon and I looked at various models. I measured my hand to see if I needed the regular or small. I read reviews. And then I ordered. I am so happy I did!<br /><br />First, I received the mouse on Tuesday. It took me until Friday to feel that I was used to it. I did notice that there can be no or very little slouching when using this mouse; you don't want your arm to bend at the wrist. This defeats the ergonomics of the mouse and makes it harder to use. Since I have scoliosis and the resulting poor posture, this was a bit of a challenge but, like I said, it only took 3 days for me to get the hang of it.<br /><br />Having spent most of my weekend at the computer, I'm amazed by this one simple fact: My hand does not hurt. Not at all. I can use my fingers without any pain or swelling in the knuckle area. My wrist doesn't hurt. Nothing! The design of this mouse puts your hand in a very natural position. I was concerned that I'd still be using the same fingers to operate buttons but because of the position my hands are in, that is no longer painful.<br /><br />Long story short: If you are in pain, the price of this mouse is 100% worth it. It's a little odd looking (or rather, it's different looking) but I like the color scheme, too. I do wish they offered more colors :)<br /><br />Now, I'll go back to gaming without pain!'d still be using the same fingers to operate buttons but because of the position my hands are in, that is no longer painful.<br /><br />Long story short: If you are in pain, the price of this mouse is 100% worth it.

B001NLKXK2|4.0|I decided to read this book because I work in health care, and see the increase in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease.  It took me a long time to finish because the subject matter is truly depressing.  I realize no 2 cases of dementia are exactly alike, but I feel that there are illustrative examples presented Still Alice which, when recalled in practice, help me empathize with patients and caregivers struggling with similar issues. Highly recommended for anyone in close contact with Alzheimer's patients.
B002BWP49C|4.0|Unfortunately the movie did not deliver the emotional richness of the book.  I am not sure if this is the fault of the screenplay, the director or the actors.  Kristin Stewart had done well in the other movies. But something was missing here. The delivery scenes were just awful and the animatronic infant was gross.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Only a VHS was available locally - now way! So, Amazon was it. My copy is superb. It's making the rounds of my family as I write. Have had nothing but perfect results with Amazon. Thank you.<br />Jack Runyon, Middlebury VT

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Well, it's two... so that's not a big surprise. I don't really use this much, I downloaded it due to it being free and it's not like I have a sudden need to do calculus on my Kindle or anything. But if you need to like add and subtract or multiply or divide, then this app is probably what you'll need.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You can't go wrong with Nicholas Sparks. I enjoyed the story line and the characters we so likable. Great beach read.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Nazi zombies inside a building or something underground. I don't remember much of what was happening. I like these movies though, and Mila Jojomojo kicks a lot of zombie butt, so all is good. Oh, and there's a bunch of explosions... so if you like zombies, explosions, Mila Vuvuzela or nazi zombies getting their butt kicked, you'll like this movie. I watched in on my Kindle and I may have been half-asleep.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Magic Academy was more fun because it had more interesting characters and world and the plot made more sense, but Mysteryville 2 is still a pretty, engaging, and enjoyable game. The timer felt a bit fast sometimes (but doesn't matter, just retry). I liked the other puzzle mini games. Recommend!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's all right. Nothing any more special that any other solitaire game. I would recomend it. Easy to use and understand.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Most games force you into buying sustainable points. This game allows you to with time earn everything. The little conversations between quests have been given thought even if the quests themselves, out of necessity redundant.<br /><br />I love watching the park grow and evolve. Not a speed demon game but those that enjoy watching ant colonies. I thin this is nicely done. My only complaint is when tough the screen during the dinasour wrangled time the screen will move or the dots will not register my touch no matter how many times I hit them..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the storyline............did not care for all the sex stuff so much but I am old,  I loved the fact that a traumatized person, could become whole because of love.
0062238868|1.0|this may not be a fair review because i did not read the whole book. in fact i did not make it past the first few pages that seemed to set the tone for the whole book. he describes an encounter where he is on the lookout as a team of marines is about to enter a street in baghdad. he sees a civilian woman arm a grenade and about to throw said grenade at the marines when he shoots the woman, killing her. he goes on to call her evil, savage, about to kill americans; then expands this to all the rebels in iraq and confesses disappointment in not having killed more of them.<br /><br />now i just finished reading \\"On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society\\" so i understand that moral distance (calling her evil), emotional distance (calling her a savage) and rationalization play a huge role in dealing with the psychological hardship that comes with killing a human being. however in my opinion, CK's arrogance puts him in the 2% sociopath group that enjoys killing.<br /><br />to me this scenario is equivalent to a group of felons that kill a home owner defending himself and his family in a home invasion and the felon that murdered the home owner rationalizing his action based on the fact that the home owner was about kill one of his teammates.<br /><br />in those few pages CK mentions that when he meets his maker, he is well assured in justifying his actions. while he seemed to be confident in having a solid defense case for himself, one wonders the true judgement of the maker. R.I.P.
0345803493|1.0|have i really spent money on this? I knew it was not Shakespeare, and I haven't prejudices against 'fashionable' novels, but is it so difficult to give a novel a PLOT, some decently rounded CHARACTERS and not to REPEAT the same pattern over and over?<br /><br />I had survived the first because it was about two people who want two utterly different things out of a relationship, so they had to negotiate them. There was the metaphor of the contract, that was -almost- interesting, and, like most of important negotiations, it failed miserably -even if for dumb reasons.<br /><br />But in Darker after the first 20 pages all this is over, and the two heroes spend the whole time biting their lips, telling the other not to bite their lips, pairing off, going about with silver balls in their body (she) and making scenes about a clearly harmless ex-submissive (he). I hate leaving things halfway but I don't have the courage to read the third.<br /><br />Two more things:<br />1- I am not from US and the idea that a foreigner get out of this book is that there the less you work and the more you are rich and successful. I mean, he spends all day mailing and stalking her; she gets a promotion after a week spent doing everything but working... No, don't worry, I don't think it's realistic!<br />2 - I am almost offended by the way Ana's eating disorders are represented, that is, as something 'classy' and somehow 'ladylike'. Not eating for 5 days and thinking 'oh, no, food' before dinner is called anorexia. It is not classy. It does not get you the favors of some kinky billionaire. So, just to make it clear.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|I finished The Kitchen House in less than 24 hours. So, it bodes well that I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Now that I've had some time to reflect, though, I'm finding myself frustrated with the book. It feels like Grissom asked herself, &#34;OK, what sequence of events will create the greatest angst and drama?&#34; and then plotted exactly that. That's not a bad thing exactly, but I feel like I could have told you after the first 50 pages pretty much what happened in the last 50 pages.<br /><br />That said, my frustrations are more about the &#34;big picture&#34; stuff. Grissom's strength is in the smaller details that gave texture to the more predictable elements. The dynamics between the house slaves and the field slaves. The little moment where Belle hisses at Lavinia to finish the ham she was served during Christmas dinner in the quarters, for instance, was a beautifully observed detail.<br /><br />I also think it's really interesting that Grissom gives us portraits of different kinds of slave owners and overseers. Old Mrs. Pyke treats Belle like a granddaughter -- but doesn't actually make sure she gets freed. The Captain (and Miss Martha) seem to want the slaves to be &#34;well-treated&#34; (you know, other than the fact that they think humans are property), but both are so distant, whether physically or psychologically, that they can't effectively enforce those standards. Marshall and Rankin are both painted as unremittingly evil. And then there's Will Stephens, who, except for the fact that he OWNS PEOPLE, seems like kind of an awesome guy; sometimes people make these ridiculous arguments that slaves enjoyed being enslaved, but I can see why Grissom portrays Ben, Lucy, and Belle as being pretty content with working for him. Given that they can't change their enslaved condition, I can see why they'd vastly prefer belonging to someone who went out of his way to (try to) keep two families together and who otherwise seems to treat them and talk to them like human beings.<br /><br />I think my very favorite parts of the book are the ones that focus on creating a family of choice in the face of terrible circumstances. Belle has as clearly become one of Mama Mae's daughters as Lavinia has become Belle's daughter, and Sukey has become Lavinia's daughter, and Jamie has become Miss Martha's lost son, DNA be damned. Belle and Lucy's unusual arrangement (or perhaps not so unusual, given the whimsical way that slave owners can create and destroy families) over Ben. And, perhaps, my very favorite moment in the entire book, when Papa points to the chickens and says it doesn't matter to them whether the chicks are black, brown, or white, and that he'll be a papa to Lavinia.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I downloaded this because I don't like not having a percentage of the battery remaining. But the audible voice warnings usually mean I never open it to begin with. Great feature.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Excellent plot, writing and characters. Interwoven plot through two distinct time periods with lots of twists and turns and forward movement. I discovered a new writer that I like, a real find.

B00003CXA6|5.0|I am a Civil War buff so I love this movie.  Ted Turner did a fantastic job.  The fact that he had civil war re-enactors to play the extras saved him a bundle and added to the authenticity of the movie.  You can tell these me had their heart into what they were doing.  However, I am very disappointed in Ted Turner for not making the third movie of this beautiful trilogy.  I said he didn't make the third movie because the first 2 didn't make enough money for him.  He's a billionaire for crying out loud!  Sorry, Mr. Turner, thought you were doing it as a labor of love, not for a buck!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best although it tends to lag a lot and people my age(11)might rage quit and I have had every up date.
0062014536|3.0|You can find this review along with many others on my blog The Dancing Nerd Writes Again.<br /><br />Initial Thoughts:<br /><br />I was very nervous to start this novel. I've been a huge fan of the series ever since I read the first two books back in November and they mean a lot more to me than some of the other books I've read recently. They were the first books I've read in a while that gave me hope and made me believe in love again (ironically enough since the books say that love is a disease), which obviously places them close to my heart and makes me feel a little protective over them.<br /><br />I trusted Lauren Oliver as an author and knew she couldn't screw this up too badly, so with that mindset I went ahead and slowly made my way through the last book in the Delirium series.<br /><br />Spoilers!<br /><br />This book oscillates between Lena and Hana's point of views. At first I was bored with Hana's parts and just wanted to figure out what was going on in the wilds with Julian and Alex and Lena, but eventually I became just as excited to read about Hana's life, especially after the HUGE reveal on page....okay so I'm not telling you what page but you'll know it when you read it.<br /><br />There were a few grammatical errors which irked me, because I don't recall there being any in the last two novels. Another thing that stood out to me was the use of the same imagery or metaphors. Like I said earlier, I feel really protective over this series and was hyper critical. They weren't huge downfalls, but I felt the novel could've been improved upon regarding these literary elements.<br /><br />The story itself flowed relatively quickly. I was a little dismayed because so much of the focus was on the plot and we didn't get to see a lot of character interaction like the interaction between Alex and Lena in Delirium or the interaction between Julian and Lena in Pandemonium. I felt like every time the plot started to slow down, and an emotional scene was coming up, the action got in the way again. I wish we could've seen more scenes between characters. I think the only real emotional connection I felt in the whole novel that was new and expanded upon, was with Hana because we got to see her side of the story told through her point of view.<br /><br />The ending: It didn't really feel like an ending and it very much felt like the author came out of character and was talking directly to her audience, which I wish would've been included in the acknowledgements instead of the actual story. It was left very open ended and almost felt like the author herself didn't know how to end the novel or couldn't decide for Lena. I guess I liked that, because it leaves it up to the imagination of the reader and it lets us interpret what will happen to the characters in the future.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I hope my review doesn't come off as being too harsh or negative because Lauren Oliver is one of my favorite authors and Delirium is one of my favorite series. She created amazing characters that are easy to fall in love with and a world that is totally and uniquely her own.<br /><br />I read Requiem during a really tough week and didn't have the best focus while reading it, which I'll be honest, may have affected my review. I tried being as objective as possible and commented on the things I thought of while I was reading the book. Although Requiem wasn't my favorite book in the series it was still an enjoyable read and I can't wait to read it again once I have the whole series (I borrowed Delirium and Pandemonium from the library).<br /><br />I'd recommend this series to anyone who is coming out of a break up, doesn't believe in love, or has lost hope. At the same time I'd recommend this book to someone who wants to explore a new type of dystopian world where love is a disease and people are fighting for the freedom to choose their own destiny. I think there are a lot of great little hidden messages and morals throughout this seriesthat are universal and relatable to anyone.<br /><br />I'm even more excited after finishing Requiem that Fox is making Delirium into a T.V. series, to see how they will expand on this story and the characters. Even though the series of books may be over, the story will continue on screen as Alex, Lena, and Julian's journeys continue.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />I normally don't leave any sort of comment in my rating section, but I wouldn't say that I loved this book. I couldn't give it just the \\"I liked it\\" rating because this book, along with its predecessors will have a special home on my bookshelf and I do plan on reading it again in the future.that are universal and relatable to anyone.<br /><br />I'm even more excited after finishing Requiem that Fox is making Delirium into a T.V. series, to see how they will expand on this story and the characters.

B0035LGXXO|5.0|Every now and then I just have to watch this cheeky but awesome movie....Some people in this movie became big stars !
B008MEM24S|5.0|Highly addictive game of physics and strategy.  Those interactive characters during and between the each games are fun too.  My 7 year old loves this game, and so as myself.
1401322786|1.0|This is my fourth Mitch Albom book.  I had high hopes for this book as I really liked his others.  Three out of the four were easy enjoyable reads.  However, this one drove me nuts trying to keep up with each story line until they merged near the end.  The message in the end is worth thinking about, but wasn't worth the time to get there.  Therefore, if you feel compelled to read all of Mitch's books get the cheapest copy possible of this one because you might end up tossing it in the waste can instead of putting it on your bookshelf.
193609648X|5.0|Crochet patterns can look like non stop GrannySquares and baby blankets, but This book is full of pretty and stylish patterns for crochet.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I have spent hours playing this game because you can reset it once you have gone through all the puzzles.  It's a lot of fun and not childish, although children can play this as well, but the themes are all different and fun to search through.  Even though you might find a number the first time, the second time it might elude you and that's what makes it fun!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I realy loke puzzles.  This game more than meets my expectations.  My wife says I'm addicted.  Now  her mom, dad and herself all play.  She also admits that it is addictive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game l o 've it<br />I love playing it so much. Great way to pass the time. Reccomend it through it does crash sometime
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I read all four books in the series in a two week time frame.  The second book was my least favorite.  But, the story gets better as it continues along, so I do recommend the series to anyone who's interested.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|So......I am apparently not a great stickman caretaker. The concept is interesting but the execution is tricksey. My stickman mostly just dies.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  I was about 90 % happy with the ending.  I would highly recommend this book to others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Seriously compelling reading with likeable characters and believable villains. Easy Fun read that builds an intriguing post apocalypse world that begs to be explored deeper.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome! U get 2 create anything u want! I recommend this app<br />for anyone who has awesome creativity. I thought I was just stuck with<br />Creative Mode! I finally figured out how to get survival mode.
B000YDCG5A|4.0|So far I find this to be a good over all boot.  As with most of the other reviews, get a full size smaller than your usual.  Other than that it's a a perfect mix of aesthetic, comfort, and functionality.<br />The one downside is traction on wet asphalt, particularly over smooth or painted surfaces, but overall I am completely satisfied with these boots.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Main character is unformed and into masochism and being hurt from a dominant person. I hoped to see her character evolve but the author went for the titulatting and unsavory side of things.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|This is another great Camel Club book.  It has the typical twists and turns that are typical of David Baldacci.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|This is literally the best of both worlds. One that is a fan of both Natural Born Chaos AND Stabbing the Drama, I can tell you there's lots of good stuff in here. And with 20 tracks, you're bound to find a lot of it. It's very heavy off the bat, but the further in you go, the more complex and diverse it gets. Definitely a great addition to the Soilwork discography.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|No problems at all. loved it and I think u should buy it<br />I had no freezing problems its long but interesting doesn't drag on or anything
030758836X|5.0|Okay, this was my third book to read by this author and I think the best. It kept me interested all the way through.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the whole series of these books.  This was the conclusion of the series and it ended it as well as could be I guess.
0307341577|4.0|My second by this author and I must say she writes very dark. I would recommend this read if you like the dark side.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I thought it was well written and the characters were really likable.  Would recommend it.
0307341550|4.0|Good book, my first by this author. A little strange at first but I was able to get in to it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this series and the writing.  This book was pretty good, although I enjoyed the first one more.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Just pick this book out of a hat ended up loving it. Keep me reading into the night wanted to know how it would end.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I watch the episodes when they come on tv, but I have to have them on disc as well.  Love it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! Lots of twists and turns and I ended up raving about it to all my friends.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe haven touches a mother's heart and soul in a way like never before. It's an eye opening read that get ones own mind thinking about the inconceivable.
1582701709|5.0|This book has absolutely opened my mind to the power within.  Honestly, the first time I read it I was very skeptical.  But when I made a plan to commit myself to utilizing The Secret in my thoughts and truly changing my perspective, I was blown away at the results.  Rhonda Byrne explains The Secret in a very effective, powerful way.  I also love how this book is full of inspirational messages from some of the most exquisite minds in history.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|The jewel case for this CD was rather scratched and the disk holder wasn't in prime condition, but that's of little consequence: I just swapped jewel cases with an old disk I had.  Other than that, the disk itself was in fine quality, as was the artwork.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|I have read lots of the reviews and I have solutions. Some people have been saying that it does not respond well. My advice, take it slow and take time to get the feel of it. I had that problem too, but I kept playing it no matter how bad I was. I now can get across the green jump platform and way beyond that. Some have said that they wish there was a place you could click to pause the game and kind of fast-forward the falling and starting over process. There is. Press on the screen somewhat near the right hand side. Three words should pop up and they should say rest, resume, or restart. (Rest means main menu.) Click restart to take you back to the beginning of the game so you can try again. I normally do that because it takes so long to watch the marble explode once I've fallen off the platform. I hope this helps!
B00908DDZM|5.0|Macklemore is fantastic. He's got a great outlook on life and relays that through his music. Songs 1, 2, and 3 are a great way to be introduced to his music and song 6 is a very real song &#34;make the money dont let the money make you/change the game dont let the game change you&#34;. He's not my favorite rapper but he's a very good rapper and his music is cool & different. He has a song called Jimmy Iovine about trying to get signed to a major label & explains why he stays &#34;I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T&#34; If he keeps making music as good as the songs on &#34;The Heist&#34; I will keep supporting him. Ryan Lewis makes great music that compliments Macklemore very well.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I think that it's a good alarm and I recommended it for everybody that is a heavy sleeper and can't wake up with a regular alarm and likes to listen to good music
B005KR6OBM|5.0|It made a great birthday gift for my husband.  I cannot wait to order the 5th season.  It is what I ordered.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! All the thanks to my friend for playing this in font of me, and for suggesting this. Perfect way to sit back and relax and go to New places at the same time. Totally five stars!
B007EE5820|4.0|If you want to know all about Arny told in an easy to read manner this is the book for you! Good value for money with a huge number of pages. We find that Arny has done a lot of interesting things during his life, that i was not aware.<br /><br />Warts and all to some degree keeps one's interest. I recommend this book for a great read.<br /><br />Power Man Barry
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I was playing it for the first time on road, And I don't know if any of you have gotten this far,but toward the end, in that house, I had my FIRST heart attack. I had 7 pages and, realizing I had missed one, I turned around and BAM! SLENDER MAN<br /> IN MY FACE! I then proceeded to recover from said heart attack with a little whimper... oh, and P.S., lainie, the guy who is in first with the comments, he needs Gloria learn how to spell... IT'S P-I-C-T-U-R-E-S, not pit cures...
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book. Made me smile, laugh, fall in love, and hurt. The world is not a wish granting factory but this book was a dream come true (:
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Chasing Mavericks is an excellent movie. The script, the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the special effects all blend into two hours of pure entertainment. You can taste the salt and smell the sea while watching as it tugs at the heartstrings and informs the mind.  This movie deserved an Oscar nomination and deserved to take a statue, but the public is on to the Oscar scam which awards Hollywood insiders rather than quality cinema.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Can't seem to stop watching this movie. Not my usual thing but the story just seems to grab you and not let go. Great directing, great casting.<br /><br />Reynee
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Didn't realize I could have watched it on Comcast On Demand for only $4.99.<br />Very good movie...interesting, good acting by all. Good story.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Case logic always best quality product.<br />All parts made with  high quality materials<br />its great fit to my SLR camera.<br /><br />Thanks..
B007REV4T8|1.0|It was almost boring. Noticed that there was hardly no music in the background (James Bond Theme) which is always played in the other Bond movies. Maybe that's what made it dull. Like Daniel Craig, but not as Bond. Think they should try to find someone else. Something missing about the movie...
B008Y73940|5.0|The movie was suspenseful and exciting...Matthew did a great job with his character! I loved the ending very captivating and not expected.
B004XQO90O|3.0|Enjoyed movie and kept my interest the first time. The second time because I knew what was happening ..it was not quite as exciting. Jake Gyllenhaal did a great acting job I thought however.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Once you get the hang of this game, it is great.  I would recommend it to all that likes this type of game.  I don't like playing it on my tablet even though I get lucky, wish they had a PC version.
1609611543|5.0|I have read this book with a critical view--being involved with public health nutritional education. Having the science to understand what Dr. Davis is discussing AND obtaining and reading most of his references listed in the back of the book, I conclude what he is saying for the most part is accurate and a wheat free diet will be beneficial in the long run. Yes, the author took some liberties with a few of his references and text, but for the most part he hit the nail on the head. He is not promoting a diet but a change in mindset about what we eat and how much. It has not been easy to go wheat free but I have adjusted, lost weight, lowered blood sugar, and overall feel better. Great work, Dr. Davis.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Helps keep my retirement years occupied when I'm lazily basking in the sun, it keeps my brain waves healthy. Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so fun.I play it all the time.I love how it has so many people to choose from.:) ;) thx
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great for animal lovers. It really makes you feel like you own a real horse. I an a huge fan of horses and have ridden them and it feels like my real horse. I recommend this app to everyone:)
B007HU7NBK|3.0|I was a big DD fan in their early years and thought JT would write about the life of the band behind the scenes.  He really didn't.  It was pretty unrevealing.  He glossed over pretty much every topic he brought up, giving detail about pretty much nothing.<br />I don't think Taylor contributed to this as much as his co-writer did.<br />At least he put in some personal photos.  They were often more interesting than the text.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|This app is fun and exciting, but you need to buy the full version. If you do t buy the full version, you can only play the first level. I play this game on my laptop and I think it is much better.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best slenderman app.(clearly)This has the best graphics.It has the best 5 star ratings out of all of the slenderman games.(i did the reaserch)I recommend buying this app it is the best!!!!!!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is in my opinion one of the BEST 007 - James Bond Movies Produced!<br />Action Packed, Great Cast, Classy way to bring back some of the retired James Bond items.<br />You will have to watch the movie to see what I am talking about.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|its so great I recamend it my sister gets on my Kendal fire so I'm going to get it for my sister
B008J05EL8|1.0|I can not even buy it because I don't live in the USA. How I am suppossed to use the office in my kindle?
0525952926|5.0|If you read the first book, Fall of Giants and liked it, you have to get this the second of the trilogy.  Simply put, it is 900 + pages and almost impossible to put down.  If you like this trilogy you should try Pillars of the Earth.  Also great.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|boring, poor animation, the previews were the best parts and the only parts that were worth watching... what a waste of time
8866131350|5.0|This planner is the perfect size and flexible enough to throw it into your coat or back pocket. I'm sure it would work great in a purse as well as it is very slim. However, the pages do not sacrifice in terms of size at all! It also has some nifty info pages such as measurements and conversions, one page that has a small ruler on it, and time zones just to name a few. I highly recommend this and will definitely buy one in 2014!
B00005JNNZ|5.0|Great item on time Good film great picture will buy again arrived on time good good good good good good
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This thing works great for honing a blade out in the wild! Has an eyelet for a lanyard (I made an adjustable cobra knot lanyard for it) and doesn't take up any space in a pocket or bag. I've reset and sharpened several knives with it and would highly recommend!
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I would give it a five star if you could look at your Bible Reading plan without WI FI - that is usually the times I want to read my Bible. As it is I have to carry a piece of paper in my Kindle case with the plan printed out on it. That seems really silly to me.
0307744434|4.0|I don't usually write book reviews, but the opportunity presented itself!<br /><br />I went on a trip and bought this book at the airport. I didn't bother reading about it too much and had never heard of it, but it looked like a good \\"escape\\" type book, so I went for it.  \\"Escape\\" books are what I like.  I'm sure it's a common theme among avid fiction readers...I like period pieces and an interesting story.<br /><br />I didn't feel like this book gripped at my heart strings or gave me a new perspective on life or anything, but I couldn't get my face out of it, for sure. It was fun and interesting enough that I ripped through it in about 3 days.  That's definitely some sort of record for me as I won't be breaking any speed reading records anytime soon...<br /><br />It's the perfect book to take to the beach, read on an airplane, etc...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is so much fun once you first play you can't stop.it's so addictive.like I mean addictive!!!!.if you look it up there's like millions and millions of people who LOVE that game.because you can ask anyone what there favorite game is and they would say subway surfers. :)
B004P8JPS6|5.0|As with most Jack Reacher novels, it becomes easy to identify with and support him as he goes up against corrupt systems or corrupt people who simply use those systems for their own benefit or purpose. I always look forward to the next Reacher adventure. Lee Child most definitely knows how to hold your interest right up to the last page.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It's about time!  Hard sci-fi with humor!  This really was a page turner!  Get it and read it!  Thanks Andy!
B00942X8PY|5.0|Another victory from noodlecake! A thoughtful and engaging puzzle game, from a very very good games designer, who routinely puts out incredible games andbapps.
B000SVZIOE|3.0|My G-babe loves robots.  the animation is great. all children need some robots in there day.  very amusing.  thank you
1401937519|3.0|It's okay, but I've read better. I would probably advise others to read it, but I have read much better stories about the after life.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is the best game I ever played. It is addicting game it is the best game of the world
1451695195|4.0|It got too technical, but otherwise was okay. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone, but possibly. The stories of actual &#34;happenings&#34; are okay, just too many technical things.
B00151G0CK|5.0|get way to get all the old hits to add with next release hot cakes .  you wont be sorry
1595141715|5.0|I haven't read this book but it was highly recommended and it will be a good read over Spring Break.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If what you liked about the previous Harry Bosch books was Harry delving into his psyche and memories, than you won't like this one as much, but it is still a good read.  It moves along a little faster than the previous books, and denouement is more like an action movie, predicatable, but fun. I wonder if Connelly is trying to get this one into a movie?
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Helen Hunt is remarkable and the story is remarkable.  The characters portrayed are real (since it is based on a true story that's a good thing!) and truly draw you in.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|My wife had seen this in the theater with her friend and friend's daughter. She really enjoyed it and could not wait to get us a copy and a copy for her two great-nieces. When they arrived we watched it and I found it to be a thoroughly delightful movie.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I watched this with my teenage daughter who had already seen it.  She knew I would love the music, which is delightful.  The plot, however, is fairly predictable, if humerous. The movie relies on stereotypes, over the top &#34;gross&#34; visuals, and hyperbole. That being said, it was quite enjoyable for what it was -- a light, fun, non-thinking movie using great  a Capella music as the driving force.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|This is one of those movies you watch, enjoy, and then quickly forget. Nothing too memorable either on the pleasurable side or the hateful side. It does have a lesson it wants to get across, but that should not surprise anyone who is chooses to watch the film.
B0012QCZ54|4.0|No complaint, Good movie, good price, good everything. I recommend this movie to everyone. See something different with good quality.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I think this might be the best .99 app I've ever bought. These things are usually a crap shoot; sometimes the games are good, other times meh.  Plague does not disappoint! I was not sure what to expect at all,  but it's a fun SIM with a bit of a macabre spin. You're supposed to eradicate all life on earth. After I got used to the concept,  I found it fascinating.  It's interesting to see what happens if you start your plague in different climates or third world vs. developed countries. I have yet to win in Normal mode,  which you need to do to unlock the next plague type without paying money. So far I have enjoyed unlocking some of the genes in Casual Mode.<br /><br />If I understand correctly,  this is one of the developer's first offerings. I'm impressed! Definitely worth a buck; there are many hours of gameplay to be had.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing ending!<br />Couldn't have asked fir a better ending to the fifty shades trilogy! I definitely would recommend for any adult!
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This series is wonderfully written and acted.  Very entertaining.  Had watched it when it originally aired.  Even better the second time around, especially with the subtitles.  Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very. very. very. very very. very good game I like it it is fun.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|A classic in the field that will lead you to further reading. It is a primer for this method.  It will give you a way to approach social problems without the normal bias one hears in the course of normal social commentary.
B0049P1M0Y|5.0|This is a great book, but I think it has a little bit of intense parts. I don't think a child under nine should read this book. But it is a very good book with action packed parts, so people should read it.  I give it 5 stars because I loved it and I think you would too.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|My book club picked this book to read because it's coming out as a movie in August and we've head good reviews about it.  Well I really enjoyed it.  I didn't see the ending coming!  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I enjoy music from The Black Keys, Kings of Leon and Elizabeth and The Catapult. I heard this band on the radio one day and decided to get the album. Every song is good on this CD. Worth every penny!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was very excited to be able to purchase Season 3 and view all the episodes in order at my leisure. Can't wait for Season 4!!! Was not disappointed even though the Season finale was so sad.....
B001TM1X0O|5.0|I read some of the POOR reviews and just want to say, this book wasn't designed to address ALL communication and dating issues; it's merely a hilarious merging of two comic's views, on what constitutes good and bad behavior in dating.  Most of the bad reviews here are from shy men, who felt it catered to gregarious player-types of men, and left them out of the mix.  Dude, this book isn't about you.  And... the women who are tearing their hair out because they identify with the scenarios covered in this book (such as 'he's married to someone else, he never calls, he's DISAPPEARED...') have been obviously dating THOSE guys, and they need a thump on the head.  Shy guys, it's possible those girls just aren't into you, so they're not making their move.  I'm super-outgoing and my ex-husband was extremely shy; still, he got it together to be sure I knew how he felt, so he wouldn't risk losing me. If your shyness is debilitating there are many good books on addressing that - this is just a different subject, for a different audience.<br /><br />Personally I loved this book because Liz and Greg are HILARIOUS.  And I'll admit that I've been in these scenarios, and I benefited from this book in a huge way - I finally ended a dead-end relationship, based on the reality I couldn't deny.  Their humor and bluntness really took the sting out of it. As a result, this is the 3rd copy I've purchased, because I keep giving it to friends (both women and men) to read! I had my daughter and her friends read it; anyone dating should read it, to hopefully avoid years of mistakes and frustration.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|works with all my cameras easy to use, light.  Going to buy another for my other camera for NIGHTLIFE TV
B00BOL22GY|5.0|Travis Fimmel is easily the most handsome man on the planet, but he's also a very talented actor (if you haven't seen The Beast or The Baytown Outlaws, you should). The rest of the cast also really pull you into the story and the setting is beautiful with incredible detail. Great show so far ... can't wait to see what happens next!
B004P91ARE|5.0|Simply great! Music flows and defines jazz itself. Absolutely fantastic.The encoding could've been better but overall the sound is decent. A must must must have in your music collection.
B0060AY85C|5.0|Once again, Toni Morrison, has reached our hearts with a,classic and tragic tale. Her writing in this book is outstanding
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a good Bible app, but it doesn't deserve some of the outstanding reviews that it gets. If you make an account on youversion, you can take notes, get access to reading plans, and join the youversion community.<br /><br />Edit (6/29/13): I made an account with Youversion a while ago in order to get more out of the app. There's a ton of reading plans available, which I love. I take notes occasionally, but you can only highlight/take notes/etc when you have an internet connection. That's a little annoying.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this app it is cool and fun and I am addicted to it now you should get this app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It seems impossible that anything could be betterthan the first Temple Run, but this app is exactly that. the zip line and mine cart are great, and the game works pretty well on my Kindle Fire, though it occassionally has trouble loading.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's journey kept me reading nonstop and now rereading again and again. Any person of faith and curiosity will find comfort in the Doctor's account. If a person does not have faith in the Almighty, reading this book will put you on the road. For me as a Catholic, it confirms what I always believed and hoped for. Dr. Alexander is without doubt a credible insturment through which the absolute power has conveyed an important message of eternal life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app. I play it all the time and now I'm addicted to the game. go temple run

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I recieved this just before my area got hit with a big snow storm. I set it up with no problems and played Xbox games for the next three days. The screen has great color and brightness. I was concerned when I ordered it if I should have gone with the bigger vanguard with the 19 inch screen but I am happy with the 15.5 which is bigger thatn I originaly thought it would be. One reason I went with this one is the cost and the fact that I perfer the black case over the bule Halo version vanguard.<br /><br />I have both Xbox 360 Pro(white box) and the newer Xbox 360(smaller) and they both fit. If you have the orginal PS3 don't expect it to fit (I have one so I can verify that it will not fit). Only the slim PS3 works, as clearly stated in the listing. I have one of the newer PS3 version called the super slim and it does fit but because the super slim as a sliding DVD cover on the top (the other versions are front loading) you will have to undo the holding straps to insert a disk. Otherwise it works find.<br /><br />UPDATE on new PS3 super slim - As stated before the new top loading PS3 fits easily in the case. The one concern that I have is that the straps go over the top sliding door and I fear that it might damage the sliding tray door. Since I do not want to make the staps to tight for fear of damage and the system is so small it tends to shift down into the case when being carried so I use a rolled up hand towel that I place at the bottom (were the case folds) of the system to keep it from moving. I think I can fix up a pad for the top that would prevent the staps from damaging the tray door but I relly don't move it long distance so what I have works fine.<br /><br />Case works best with the Xbox 360 slim. I do not have the PS3 slim front disk loading version so I cannot comment that model.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I love the graphics and how realistic the dinosaurs are. I like that the original characters are included in the game. There it's one thing keeping me from rating this a five star app. When I try to connect my game to Facebook I getting a message on Facebook that says &quot;Jurassic Park Builder is misconfigured for Facebook.&quot; Can the Dev please fix this bug? Or is this because I haven't finished the tutorial yet?
B005FISBTO|2.0|I have been a fan of this series.  I was disappointed with the series.  I did not like the characters.  I felt they were not convincing as others in the past.
B0002CX4RM|4.0|Strong performances by Doming and Borodina.  Good acting with plenty of strong drama, good voices and very realistic stage effects
B003AMAOW4|2.0|Nothing memorable comes to mind out of this production.  The minimalistic stage does not seem to add to the performance and the singing is somewhat average.
B004ECFW94|4.0|Placido's voice is not at its best on this production; but his acting is tops.  The supporting roles are well cast and overall is a good production.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|If you want a reading experience that is a page turner, this is one. I did not delete it when I read it, I saved it for again, which for me, is a rare thing!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|The construction is first-rate, and the design is exactly what I wanted. My new 17-inch laptop fits perfectly, as well as the power brick and my other odds and ends. Much better than the briefcase-style I was using. A friend of mine has had one just like it for three years, and it has held up well.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I'm so happy they have this game on the kindle now! I remember it only being on the IPhone and now it's on here! I love this game,  it's worth buying
007174889X|5.0|That makes you want to study! Excellent book, excellent appearence, excellent price. I highly recommend it! You should buy it now!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is fun and addicting. It is challenging and enjoyable all at the same time.Very happy with this purchase.I'm glad that it is not too easy so you don't go through the levels to quickly.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This movie is a must buy for bat fans and joker fans because u finally get to see joker kill some people and it freaking epic so u should buy this movie ok bye
0802473156|5.0|This book is one of the best book I ever read, I came across it through my friend at work, I borrowed it from him and finished reading it in 2day, I love it and decided to buy my own copy. Three people already borrowed it from me and they now have their own copies.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For anyone who grew up in the 80s, this book will take you on a nostalgic ride, so detailed, that you may think you are playing the game! Well done, highly recommended.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!!  It grips you and makes you want yo keep reading!  I couldn't put it down!! 💜 Gideon!!
B0050IY61G|5.0|This book is an excellent introduction to this baffling problem. It is easy for anyone to read without being simplistic, and yet it reduces complicated ideas to easily digestible points. I have read other books on Asperger's Syndrome, and this is the best so far. If you are interested in this topic, or love someone who is living with it, if you read nothing else, read this. Not just information, but also advice on what can be done. He also gives good references, and easily hands out credit to others from whom he has learned or borrowed. It also seems easy for the person with ASD to read and provides a great starting point for working on the challenges they face.
0307951529|5.0|Bought this for my husband as he's been trying to start this own business and he found it very inspirational.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Great movie! For all the dog lovers out there, it's a must see! A truely heartwarming story you will enjoy..... you may need a kleenex or two!
0743455967|5.0|it's a really good book which describes a lot of his own life and experiences and step-by-step how he might make a story out of them.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The best thing since UP STAIRS / Down Stairs or West Wing. If you have not viewed it you are missing a geat deal!!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A book that takes you to places you have never been.  My book club read this book and we all enjoyed it.  The end leaves you with lots of questions.  This it why I only gave it 4 stars, but some people like open endings.  Worth the read!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I had this game on my phone. Now I have a kindle and it was my first app couldn't wait to see it on a bigger screen. My 8 yr old granddaughter had an iPod touch and she wanted it for her device so we have 3. Kscollinsx4, kscollinsx3 and kscollinsx1 add us. Very addictive.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I enjoy watching the show, now I can listen to the music always, whenever I want! Really happy that I could purchase this CD looking forward to the next one!
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The Bourne series is a great series and very entertaining action movie, that continues to build up through out the series. My only issue is the amount of swearing and using God's name in vain (either using God or Jesus with a damning referrence). Which pretty much ruins the experience for me, but if you don't care about that then its a 5 star movie.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|Too short for the price I paid. Don't think.I.Will buy another Will just wait on tv. Should include more in one book
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I am old enough to remember when this was going on. The movie made you feel like you were there. Kind of kept you on the edge of your seat. Good acting by all. Well worth the time to watch.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Any Miyazaki fans will love this one too! It's my favorite. Great story, art, characters. Everyone should see this film.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent continuation of the story and very addictive read. Although the story can be a bit tiresome at times, the ending is a surprise that will make you go out and buy the next book without hesitation.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I loved this movie after watching it on Instant View with my teenage daughters and can't wait to buy it!  Finally a beautiful, touching story that the whole family can enjoy.  What an amazing woman!  The way she opened up her heart and home.  It has really inspired my family to do the same.  I love the young man.  What amazing strength of character and ability to overcome such a hard life!  If only more of the world could be like them.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Read the book for a class. Amazing how the view of vampires has changed over time. Kindle version was so convenient.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is great for your daily activities and lots more. Love the color changes and the calendar agenda is easy to store. I love  everything about it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|We are very happy with this. It was a Valentines present for my son in law. He loves it. As does my 5yr. old grandson.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is an awsome game if you like temple run you'd like this i play it all the time awesome game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These are the best books I have ever had and read and this is the truth so you should read it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the book because  it made sense . The book is easy to read. And you and read it any where you want.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Loved this movie!!! It's all about the music, How inspiring! I will watch it over and over and over again. The music is beautiful! I can't get it out of my head!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|i love this game!!!!!!!:)))))))))))))) it is the best game ever. when i play it i feel like it is all i evrr want to play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the second season. This is the second time i have seen it and I pick up all the subtle humor of the characters especially the Dowager Countess. Also I love Carson's expressive face and his eyebrows.
B002H6ZQRM|3.0|certainly worth watching once, but not nearly as good as I was expecting. And I wouldn't spend money to see it.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Started off slow for me, getting used to new characters, thought a detective named Heat in the middle of a heat wave was lame.  But all the characters developed and took on a life.  Before I knew it I was totally immersed in the book and really enjoyed it.  Looking for was to the next book in the series.
B003SNKBXW|5.0|I have no idea why Roman Polanski made his devil worship movie when he had such a great source text to begin with. Better in every respect.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I have been using Xiia Live for three or four years now, on two different models of smart phone without issue. Wish it had the ability sync stations with my tablet.
B007PFD90G|3.0|I saw Rushdie speak in DC when this book was published.  His interview was fascinating.  Life under the fatwa seemed full of intrigue, danger and boredom.  I love his writing and was so excited to read this book.  Writing in the third person, gave this memoir a compelling distance, but ultimately it would have benefited from editing.  Very long winded, this book took an exciting chapter of Rushdie's life and make it somewhat dry.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|How refreshing to read something this engaging. Hunger Games + Anthem and a bunch of others besides. Highly recommended for anyone that believes in individual achievement and worth and objective right and wrong.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I have only made one purchase from eBay and I am very pleased. They keep you updated on your order so you know what is going on with it. I like that a lot!!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Nothing special here.  A typical Bond film.  Same basic Bond story.  Lots of action, but maybe a little less action than most Bond movies.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|As stated in the description above, \\"...this is a fixed- format version of the book, which looks nearly identical to the print version.\\"<br /><br />I actually bought this little hardcover book for my wife for Valentine's Day. We started a ritual where she would come to my home office and read one of the poems every night. The dim lighting of my office combined with my wife's increasing presbyopia caused her to stumble and misread, reducing the enjoyment of these otherwise delightful little \\"feline poems\\".<br /><br />I decided to buy her the Kindle version so she could read it on her Kindle Fire HD (another Valentine's Day gift). It was the first book she has accessed via the Kindle Fire HD, so we are both new to this device and it's use, but I was surprised when there was no option to pinch zoom or even select an increased font size. From what I have read, some books come with this capability and others do not. I assume the above statement about \\"fixed format\\" means that there is no option to change anything about the font. This is unfortunate. My wife now benefits from being able to read it in dim (or no) light, but the text size is small and not adjustable.<br /><br />Can those of you who have purchased this book for their Kindle Fire HD verify that this is the case and we are not just missing something obvious?<br /><br />The book itself is a lot of fun for people owned by cats, but I just wanted to comment specifically on the Kindle version of the book.
B003MXEUYO|5.0|You'd think it would get old after three movies, but Willis just gives a thrilling performance.  The premise needs some suspension of disbelief, but that's easy enough with McLane getting to work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not normally into anything zombie or sci fyi. I found those scenarios got boring rather quickly. However, the series has little to do with zombies and mostly the group and character dynamics. My husband and I fell in love with the show right away and have our \\"walking dead marathon nights.\\"  Wonderfully series that keeps you guessing and very entertained.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I have been reading Sci-Fi for over 50 years, ever since Tom Corbet Space Cadets, Books (before the 50's TV Show.<br /><br />This was a fast, gripping fun read.  I hated for it to end,  always the mark of a good book for me.  I would love to see this story made into a movie.
B000002IMG|5.0|I love cd it is Testaments best!! This is when they was very hungry and original!! I had this when I was young and i have bought it 3 more times since then.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|Cheap enough not to add to collection...<br />Not the greatest RomCom out there but it did have some good scenes. May be the last time Drew Barrymore looked good.
1592407889|4.0|I have always considered Shirley MacLaine to be a very talented, quirky nut.  This book has only confirmed my opinion.  If one-half of Sachi's memoir is true, she endured a miserable and alienated upbringing.  I don't think you can make this stuff up especially her father's idiosyncrasies and betrayal.  I found her low self esteem and continuous need for approval to be totally believable under the circumstances.  I recommend this book and hope she and Shirley can somehow make amends before it's too late.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Not as good as the comic books but it'll do for now. Takes a whole life of it's own and great entertainment for kids 5 and up.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Amazon service for the movie rental was good, better then Comcast.<br />Did not however care for the movie, you think somone made this move just to make money
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The first few chapters bored me to the point that I had to watch reruns of a popular 80' TV series in between.  The story picked up towards the middle and it got interesting from there.  Every imaginable and unimaginable creature from the \\"other\\" world is present here - casters, incubus and succubus (vampires, or kind of), seers and sheers, and what have you.  It's a grand gathering!<br /><br />I have two takeways:  One, it's best to be true to oneself.  Second and most important, amidst the wonder and chaos of this world and the \\"other\\" one, love will always prevail.<br /><br />On to the 3rd book...
B003EVWDR0|3.0|Loses appeal without the 3D. All of a sudden the plot seems Dances with wolves the science fiction edition. Loved Sigourney Weaver though.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was a very cute movie with a great story line I enjoyed with my daughter who also liked it very much
0062215507|5.0|As an embarrassingly obsessed Harry Potter fan, I have read just about everything that there is to know about Harry Potter and this book had a lot of new information to me. I also like that it gives you a lot of background information on some of the props, and on locations shoots, etc. A lot of behind the scenes info!
B0073XORCY|5.0|Let's face it; you either love Ian Anderson, or you don't.  I happen to like him very much.  This album is great.  It's quite the Jethro Tull reunion.  There aren't many surprises, just good, solid, English folk-rock.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I am giving a review before finishing the game so I hope that it is as good on the rest of it,I have just finished the first world and I like it so far,,I have had to use the hints a few times..I wish that there was a little more directions..it has a lot of hidden objects so far..the story line is okay,,,I was pleased with the first part..and I am glad that I bought it..give it a try and yes if you try the free part YOU will have to pay for it..I read the comments and decide what game I am going to get and just buy it..I have enjoyed this and I think you will to if you try it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is one of the best authors EVER! I am never disappointed in his books. I highly recommend this trilogy to anyone wanting a good read!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|this is a great book . you can feel the pain end it makes you feel like you are with them . you can’t put it down ,
B00B2166BS|4.0|Over time, charging your Nexus 10 with the Micro-USB port will generate irreversable wear and tear to the contacts and the integrity of the connection.  Currnently, the Micro-USB port is the only way that you can connect the Nexus 10 to your computer to transfer data, so damaging this port could prove catastrophic for most users. The Pogo Cable is a simple, albeit expensive, fix.  The Pogo Cable connects magentically, and breaks free easily so your Nexus is not damaged if the cord be tripped over.<br /><br />The only downside to this cable is that it can only be used for charging.  Your computer will not see it when you plug it in and you will not be able to perform any tasks on your computer using the pogo cable.  It is only capable of charging.<br /><br />For a $20 cable, I'd certainly expect more than just a charger. I think they should have included a wall AND car adapter to be totally worth the money, but it does what it says it does, and thats all.<br /><br />Design and strength, I rate it a 5, but for capability, I rate it a 3...  overall, I gave it a 4.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Far exceeded my expectations. Great to unwind to at the end of the day. I can't wait to see more.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Took me a minute to get into it but when I finally did, I couldn't put it down. Read the whole thing. Really good!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Straight to the point. Honest and direct first personal account.<br />Easy reading till the end.<br />Kindle reading easy on an Ipad.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Excellent!!!! This show is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Definitely need to watch this show!
B00633W614|4.0|A good book by Archer.  the sequel of the Clifton chronicles.  Kept me interested even though i don't think it was his absolute best book.  I will read the next installation.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|itz. the bestest I'm 1000 reviewer y hay ya y hay ya hay hay hay why. Jen Jd uxbe. xjs bs
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This was the first book by Archer that I read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  With good plot twists it kept me interested throughout.
B000E9910W|5.0|great music, what else can I say. All the music was what it was stated to be and have loved every minute.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|There are not enough words to describe this incredible series the the U.K. is bringing us.<br />I adore this show and will continue to watch and buy the series as long as it is still being made. Live for Downton Abbey!!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Its cool to play when your doing nothing.<br />the image looks amazing when you drive it and<br />the up grades are amazing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am enjoying the lives of this British family and their servants during the early 1900's.  The social graces are refreshing.  Maggie Smith makes me smile and reminds me of my English Grandmama!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|i really liked the movie.. Ben afflacks character was a little quiet,it would have been cool to get more background on him.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Adorable movie! If the trailers had been better, I would've been glad to see it in theaters (we rented it instead). I didn't even realize it was Pixar until it came out on video!<br /><br />It had funny parts but the thing I loved most about it was how creative the movie was. Genius! I loved the video game world that they made and you can tell the animators had a fun time creating it too. Even for someone who isn't into video games (like me), it was a fantastic movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is the television program of the decade. This season will keep you riveted and on your toes. Expect a roller coaster of dramatic twist and turns. Be prepared to for shock, anticipation, amazement and awe.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|This album starts off in classic Jack White / White Stripes fashion. Driving rhythms and well paced lyrics. But then it veers into a indie-folk Americana with Love Interruption. After that, the album bounces from historical American influences of Jazz, Blues, spirituals and early rock and roll like a pinball. The guitar work maintains Jack White's reputation for thrilling riffs throughout.<br /><br />I am thrilled Amazon had this on for $5. It was a steal.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and felt the writing was very good.  I have already recommended this book to several friends.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book was very comforting and made my beliefs more concrete than they were.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has any doubt.  Doubt no more
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It's an interesting point of view which no pretende be a best sellar.<br />Good story. I recommend it.<br /><br />J R
0316077046|5.0|Beutiful Darkness reminds us that guilt can derail us from our chosen path in life and that true love can bring us out of the darkness we get ourselves caught in. True love lights the paths we are meant to travel and brings us together even in the most dire of circumstances. This book leaves us anxious for the next to find out how the story progresses.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I got this app about two months ago. My friend had told me about this so I decided to try it out. I really really like this app. It is fast and I use this everyday.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|The movie is very enjoyable. My kids love it. It held their interest throughout the whole movie. I would recommend.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|I really did not like this movie and was sorry I rented it.  The only saving grace was it was supposedly based on a true story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read! I couldn't put it down except when I was forced to. I recommend this to teens and adults.
B008133MDK|5.0|Cant wait for the next season. A great performance by all actors. Good remakes of the original stories. That is all.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is a lot of fun I love the sound and movements of the dinos!!!  I also love that I can connect with my friends on facebook to get more help with my park.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille has followed through with his husband/wife team - John Corey & Kate Mayfield - in a humorous, page turning novel.<br />Truly enjoyed the writing and plot.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best James Bond - Outstanding!  Great story line,  beautiful women, despicable villian, amazing scenes and of course the sexiest Bond ever!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'm a Jack Reacher fan.  I've read a couple more recent books and wanted to find out how it all started.  It was a great read.
B003CBVU30|2.0|My kids thought this was funny. I thought it was stupid. Guess I'm just too old! Not my kind of humor
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|The historical accounts made in the book are very informative and illustrate beautifully the hypotheses developed by the authors to explain the failure of nations. Excelent economics coupled with excelent historical reports.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Unless you're the type of person whose opinion of a book is based solely upon how it ends, Gillian Flynn's &#34;Gone Girl&#34; is a worthy read. The book grabbed me from the beginning and kept me engaged throughout. Having read the reviews, I knew there were extreme opinions about the ending, but I wanted to see for myself. I was really hoping that it wasn't going to be as bad as some said. Unfortunately, it was. It wasn't shocking, just disappointing and not worthy of the rest of the book. It's almost like someone took over for Ms. Flynn (someone completely lacking her imagination) and finished the book for her. Even so, now that the book is over, the characters are with me as I imagine how it all could've ended differently.<br /><br />.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The weather channel is good - but where is the radar.  I have used AccuWeather and find it very easy to use, but for some reason the Weather Channel is confusing to me.  I guess I just don't get it.
0679805273|5.0|someone gave this to me for my high school graduation and it was a great gift.  i saw on pinterest to have all of your children's teachers sign it with a little message then give it to them when they graduate high school so that is what I'm doing.  Can't wait to give it to them (in 10+ years)!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Everyone knows this is an awesome movie - and book.  If you are in the mood for an awesome love story that is sure to make you cry - just watch this one.
B007M45PMU|5.0|At first I thought the album was just &#34;alright&#34; but then it somehow got to be the only album I listened to in the car for weeks! The songs are catchy, the music is good, it's an overall feel-good album!
B008HK3XKO|2.0|This case fits wonderfully and looks good.  My complaint is that it will not stand alone.  It slides down easily.  Actually I am shopping for a new one.
B000URX1DG|5.0|I bought this cd after knowing all of the songs just from listening to this genre for so long. No bad songs here; this album is a definite classic.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|Great movie to Watch! Would rent from Amazon again! Watching this movie made me want to purchase the DVD through Amazon.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel, got a crappy script that he couldn't do anything with it and he's not a very convincing drunk.  Supporting actors were terrible
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved the first book, so I had hoped going into this one, it would get better, it did! Love it!
0385344228|5.0|I must say I was thoroughly impressed with this book and couldn't put it down.  As a parent, you can see and understand both the mother's and father's perspective, with only one taking the responsible and difficult path, though the twists and turns made every decision tentative and uncertain.  I was genuinely disturbed by the ending of this book and still think about four weeks later......that's the mark of a great book!
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|The score to this series is great! Its hard to decide which one I like better! Super excited Carter Burwell came back for this!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy Mahjong as it doesn't require me to pay close attention.  I like the continuous settings (not timed) so I can just play at my own relaxed pace.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|This movie was very good... Animation and artwork was awesome...it's so amazing how the can accomplish such realistic characters with the animation...
B0076DELIG|4.0|I'm happy to provide a star rating, but won't do any more reviews where I am forced to write something.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining. Very addictive like the game modes and power ups. Definetly worth playing if you like these type of games.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|You need to make more characters for this game my daughter has already got all of them and wants more.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I like all the power ups and how depending on the game mode there is no time limit. I don't like to feel rushed when playing a game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Make sure you have a long stretch of time to watch, because you won't want to be interrupted. Now to wait for Season 4...
B0086700CM|3.0|I get tired of this game pretty fast from boredom. needs to have more game options and maybe some power ups.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It is people like Kyle that we as Americans owe so much to.  It is also people like Kyle's who sacrifice so much for the rest of, that we owe to them that we do our part and take the time to elect good leaders for the good of the country and not for the lowest common denominator in society. This is the greatest country in the world and it has sacrificed some of the best in its society rather then the worst. Just look at our politicians and the people they most represent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ends about how you would expect it, but then there are additional short exerpts that give you a little more history.
B002M87V0A|5.0|One of the best films ever made, especially for music lovers of my generation. This rates at the top of my favorites list for musicals along with &#34;The Sound of Music.&#34; And the performance of The Buffalo Bills gave me, as well as countless others, an awareness and appreciation for old-time barbershop singing which not only endures today, but thrives!<br /><br />The streaming quality was excellent, even better than Netflix, which for some reason has chosen not to offer this film for streaming. That's their loss, and Amazon's gain. Keep up the good work and I'll likely be back to rent another film which Netflix won't stream!
B00BHU2A7I|1.0|The making of one of the most famous and influential films of the 20th century...and we focus 50% of the running time on Alma Reville's (fictional) dalliance with infidelity?<br /><br />This is a movie made for people who watch PSYCHO and find it \\"overrated\\"...in other words, audiences who cannot bear to be challenged in any way, who cannot view anything outside of the prism of the year they are living in, and who crave to knock established Hollywood icons off their pedestal.<br /><br />Hopkins is fair.  Mirren in better.  There are moments of pleasure (i.e. the marketing and screening of PSYCHO itself...a truly fascinating and revolutionary moment in Hollywood ballyhoo...it gets about 8 minutes of screen time).<br /><br />The drab and forgettable HITCHCOCK labors over too much \\"Director Dearest\\" nonsense, Ed Gein daydreams, and fictionalized (boring) marital complications.<br /><br />Watch the \\"Making of Psycho\\" documentary on the PSYCHO dvd instead.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Awesome songs. Really catchy tunes. Must get it. Train rocks out yet again. Cheesy lyrics with great guitar riffs. Makes you feel like dancing.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Not an Adam Sandler fan.  But you'd hardly know this was him.  Decent story line, funny delivery, good songs.  Whole family (mom/dad + 2 teen girls) liked it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|It's as good as the rest of the series.  I just got done reading the whole series in chronological order.  Can't wait for the next one!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Love Johnny Depp.  Not everything but most.  This film just never came together.  Lots of campy references with few actual jokes.  I didn't care for any of the characters and the love story could have been fleshed out better.  Great costumes, great sets, nice choreography.  But still not what I wanted.  Oh well...sometimes Rotten Tomatoes is right.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the app is good and like Pc except for some items and abilities like redstone and opening chests on creative but it is still very good. also I read reviews wondering about kindle fire updates. the amazon services are slow but the game will update automaticly on kindle fire. it might take a week but it will. overall good buy. even if it is 7 bucks.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The grandson loved the book. He read it in one day. He loves the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you have an ebook in you that's dying to get out, this is a must have to get it on Amazon.com!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|The kids enjoyed this game very much. The Angry Birds game is one game they do not seem to get  bored with.
B0018CENUC|5.0|This album has Toby's biggest hits is all that's needed to be said. If you like Toby then buy this album.
B0012FHGCW|3.0|Sorta over hipped with a contrived story line...seems to celebrate youthfull niavity.  For all you've who've every considered just bumming around here's a guidebook.
B003EYVXVY|5.0|I don't usually buy 3-D or even Blu-Ray dvds because I'm more interested in the substance and plots of movies and don't know anything about the technical differences that a lot of reviewers seem to be concerned about. Some of my favorite films are oldies but goodies in Black & White but when I saw this one when it first came out at a movie theater I knew it was really going to revitalize the 3-D motion picture production that has been languishing out there for a long time. The special effects and colors are absolutely amazing and even if the story sucked ( which it didn't) this movie is worth seeing just for them. I purchased a 56 inch, HDMI/3-D ready TV  last year in anticipation of buying a copy of it when it become available and I have not been disappointed. It's true a living room as small as mine isn't the same as watching it on a big movie theater screen with surround sound and all the other bells and whistles but I can watch it over and over from my comfortable LazyBoy Recliner any time I want to and it is still an extraordinary experience. Every thing is smaller but the realistic feeling of being there in the midst of things is phenomenal. Scenes that make you think you are on the edge of a precipice or looking down from a great height make my stomach knot up like it would if it was really happening. Amazon's price finally came down to a point where I could afford to buy the DVD. When it arrived I was a little leery of opening the box because it says &#34;Promotional copy-Not for resale&#34; on the cover and I was almost afraid it would be a bad copy or something would be wrong with it like being dubbed in a foreign language with non-English sub-titles but it plays very well and I am quite pleased with my purchase. Buy it, you'll like it!
B00BBW16HW|4.0|This was a great funny film...it's very well done.  Moves along smartly and has a strong story line, well acted.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Rayman Origins is the one I got to play and fell totally in love with this platform game. And when I saw they got this on Android I jumped in right away. What makes this platform game stand out among others is original concept, design and artwork. its not just about beautiful artwork they also make sure you are challenged enough and engaged into the game. Love It !!
B007CF7L9O|5.0|The Papo Dinosaur fighures are among the best figures I have seen. I'm 63 and have seen a lot of figures over the years. Yes I started out with the Nabisco cereal figures back in the 50s and have loved dinosaurs ever since. Took a Paleontology course at Northern Arizona  University and have a library full of the dino books both basic and very advanced. The Brachiosaurus is just one of the great figures produced by Papo.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I was introduced to this book by a co-worker and I love it.  I was marriage for 25 years and wish I had this book at the beginning of the marriage.  I have married people and now it will become part of my pre-marriage counseling.  What a power book!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is such an imaginative and funny movie.  Some scary violent parts towards the end, but nothing too powerful. A must see!
014050639X|5.0|This book is a favorite of my son, he loves spotting the various people that on that page. Something that even my wife didn't catch within the book, (and she's read this book since she was a little girl), Mother Hubbard is the one that bakes the Plum Pie. Really look at the illustrations and you'll see that they show a second story within.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good book. I recommended this book to all my clients. I never read these kinds of books. Only romance but it was great!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great story and very well made movie. The best movie Oscar was well deserved. Tells you an accurate history of Iran/US relationship, so you learn something too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I This app is so addicting I sometimes play it twenty four seven I would recommend this to anyone anywhere anytime
B008XBHIEY|3.0|I remember seeing this when it was released and was telling my son how scary it was.  I can't believe how bad the special effects were.  At the time they were amazing... And no, it isn't scary anymore.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|I expected better from Quentin. The story/plot is awful and the action scenes were overkill. The entire movie is pretty much an endless loop of the trailer. I'm glad I didn't see it at the theater. Wait for Redbox or Netflix; don't pay $3.99 on Amazon.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I watch a movie every five years due to the lack of culture and class in our society.  But I give this movie high remarks.  Its based on reality and fact.  Well acted. Felt like I was implanted onto the scene in Tehran 1979
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very addictive!  The director's vision is Oscar caliber. The cast is well put together and keeps the viewer drawn in with great talent.<br />Best TV show period!!!
B00B935SUY|5.0|This movie was simply about good music and the great people and instruments that make good music. It is a must see for anyone who digs music!
0061900656|5.0|This is a cute book that I read to my two year old. I like that it talks about all the things he will and will not be able to do with the baby. He is unsure if he really wants a little sister, so this book is great to get the conversation going about all the cool things he will be able to do as a big brother.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Outstanding character acting and tremendous writing. This show will hook you in and not let go--can't wait for season 5!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good graphics, cute fun, especially for kids that love horses. Or adults, lol! I was really impressed with the visuals and the smooth animations. Good game!
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This game is nice. It plays great with no lag and looks good on the Kindkle Fire HD 8.9. I't very easy to play and has a simple tutorial when you first start playing it. Nothing hard about it. Just install and play. Reminds me of a computer game I used to play way back when... Levels are very easy to start and slowly start getting hard but they never get too hard. All the levels can be solved with little time and some effort. no level should take you more the 1 minute or 2. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like to play this while I watch tv, I have ADD and this low stress game makes it easy to do both.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Sometimes it seems difficult to find a children's movie that you can enjoy watching with the young children in your life, but this one is very entertaining for me as an adult and my great niece loves it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game of all time. U should most definently get it I love it so much. And don't forget to update
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a non violent, family show which is teaching you about the society in that time and how the rich lived.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Very good, easy to use.  Being able to put numbers into the boxes and editing FAST are nice and easy.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|The songs are great, and the vinyl comes with a cool poster (that looks just like the cover only bigger) and minimalist packaging.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Paid $25 for this gem, and am loving every minute of it. Honestly it could be even better if they didnt show such graphic gore and sex. There is one scene that me and my girlfriend literally fast forwarded through cause it was too hard to watch. I wish the directors would realize the potential for this show to keep growing in popularity, but they have eliminated such a huge audience by having those scenes in it. I guess that is what you get with HBO
B008BU70HW|5.0|Fabulous book that will have you only wanting more!  I can't wait for the forth year shows! This series is very well written!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its like sooo amazing and awsome. Sometimes when I play it and die I  get mad and want to scream but.after I do play it I'm happy as can be again this game is like a resolution of somewhere to make my anger completley disappear.I absolutley positivley cannot see another game like this I refer it to everyone I see or know because I love it sooooooo much.If you are reading this review than you are just as  awsomeas this game is thank.you for reading
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is great! I play almost every day. Its great how the new updates change the scenery and the objectives. I love it!
0446693804|5.0|When it comes to Nicholas Sparks, I just absolutely cannot complain about anything. He is a purely terrific author with all of his books. I have no complaints about him at all.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This movie is just as great as the other 2 I will be buying this movie for my collection :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I wasn't quite expecting for the story to turn out like it has but as I started reading, I had a hard time putting my kindle down. This book is just super good and very inspirational.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is an amazing show, and Season 3 is by far the most exciting season, yet! Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I highly recommend this app it is fun and it is like you have your own horse<br />Get it and try it if you want
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is spectacular. The movie adaptation of an even better book was successful, not perfect, but about as good as one could expect. Read the book first!!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|What a great movie. Denzel Washington nails the part...from the cocky, confident senior pilot to the weak-willed drunk. The long shot of the &#34;little bottle&#34; is the only time I can remember that I wanted to shout out - &#34;Next scene, cut to the next scene&#34;.  And then the film really takes off. Great job showing us the desperation and life of an alcoholic.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I am currently on the 4th book of this series which is a real page turner. Of the three books I've read so far, this is my least favorite of the series. Lena is so whiny and I end disliking her for a good while. This book seemed sort of stuck for a bit but I still recommend this book since the next two are SO great! Definitely worth it so you can understand what is being referenced in the next books.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Held my interest all the way through...some surprises...written well...family dynamics are pitiful for all concerned..reminds me of other's troubled lives
B001M6RVOO|5.0|James Herriot's natural writing ability is both captivating and endearing.  While he tells of his life beginning as a young veterinary surgeon we get caught up in both the animals he treats and thepeople he sees. Filled with humorous moments.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|To be fair, I wasn't a fan of the musical either.  The music is fantastic and I was super impressed about who actually sang in the movie.  However this has to be one of the WORST plots ever...it makes absolutely no sense.  If it weren't for the music (I do love me some Abba) there would be absolutely no redeeming qualities
1616550414|5.0|I was so happy when this came in the mail! It is so much prettier than I thought it would look! This book has everything you would ever want to know. It came sealed and in great condition too. Defiantly worth my money!
B002WIDRM6|4.0|This band has such great chemistry when they sing together.  This is a great song to showcase that fact.  A great cross-over country (not rock) band!
B0063M22QO|5.0|The different levels of play make it easy to  get started.. The touchscreen is .very easy to operate which gives the game more speed, which I enoy very much. Since I was familiar with Mahjong I did not look for instructions, therefore I<br />don't have an opinion whether they are available and how easy they are to understand. The same is true for help features
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I've loved CB since Newsies!  This is not my favorite Batman although I think CB is fantastic in it.  It's dark yet has some levity with Heath Ledger / the Joker.  It seems like there are some disconnects with the earlier movies but if you just ignore that fact you can still enjoy the movie.  And even though it's not my favorite, I really like where the director is going with this next &#34;grouping&#34;
055338466X|1.0|Patronizing and simplistic, it's little more than a coloring book or 'primer' for the unthinking and credulous. Compare to Robert Spitzer's or Thomas Nagel's recent volumes, both of which are closely and responsibly argued.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|I'm a self-diagnosed, sci-fi lover so this was a must see for me.  I can't say that it was much different from some of the other movies out there (including even Independence Day) but I'm glad I watched it.  Not sure if I would buy it again, though, it just wasn't that different to me
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie is very good,,,, keeps you guessing ... The cast did an exquisite job.....would recommend it. Thank you a
B000TEMRXA|5.0|How can you not like Huey Lewis & the News?!?!  This CD has almost all of their very best songs on it and a few lesser known ones. It's a great addition to your 80's collection!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|We actually enjoyed the movie. To give it more than three stars would be evaluating it much higher than it probably deserves, but it would be especially enjoyable for young children.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I loved this movie.  I'm a big sci-fi geek and I loved the beautiful scenery and characters in this movie.  I can't say that the plot was the most fantastic I've ever watched but it was entertaining and, again, the beautiful scenery & characters made up for it
6305311463|4.0|I've watched this movie many times.  I know what they are going to say before they say it.  So why watch it?  There is something intangible about this movie that makes it a classic.<br />I'm not a movie critic so I can't analyze all that stuff movie critics see that I don't.  But I know it's a great movie-I just can't explain it.<br />This is one of those movies to watch when you don't feel like tackling a new movie.<br />So if you want an old new friend that insists on popping up to say 'HI' every now and then you should watch this movie.  Now, please excuse me-there's a new movie I just thought of to watch for the 25th time.
B0013LL2Z2|3.0|I got this movie after seeing a clip of it on TNT.  Not as great as I remember it but great for the price :)
0470474874|5.0|Excellent book, great samples, very detailed. A must read for beginners to advance users.<br />As a reference book is great, and a study book teach every detail of excel plus a bunch of tips
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It's a classic & well before &#34;Global Warming&#34; became a trendy topic.  The voice-overs are awesome, there are some funny lines, and the animation is great.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|Cool. This book is so good I finished it in one day and I'm not known for reading but this
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie was pretty true to the book.  It was great and well acted.  Emma Stone is too cute as always!
B00A7Q814Y|5.0|This set is such a bargain!  Barely more than 2 dollars a CD.  I already have many of these recordings by Böhm and Abbado, but don't mind the duplications to get even more conducted by Bernstein and Abbado.  The Wiener Philharmoniker have such a beautiful sound with any conductor!  Thanks, DGG!
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a classic 80's teen movie.  Some of the effects seem cheesy vs. today but the story line is still awesome and the acting is even better. George Lucas produces so you know you can't go wrong!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|It's on my kindle and I play it continuously  all day. At work and on my commute to work. Love this album.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|This is the best adaptation I have seen of the book.  The ending is the best, another good one for director Burton.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Works perfectly for my needs. Everything I was looking for and more. I have my husband using it also and we both love it.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This was a great fianle to the Dark Knoght Trilogy and really brings all the pieces together.  It will be diificult to see where this could possibly go next.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This movie was a gift to my boyfriend since he truly enjoys any movies that deals with Zombies...lol...he truly enjoys it and I would recommend it.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Confusing and dumb, casting was bad as well with a stupid musical score.  The original was much, much better.  Don't waste your time.
B007IK44CK|4.0|You know they're just doing this for the fun of it, but that's still cool. Five more words are required.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|this app stinks. I want to download the app and the app will not download and I was excited to play now I don't care
B0036R92V2|4.0|I hate that movie directors have no originality and resort to using things from the past, wanted to see the potty django
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love this show very good streaming quality.I cant wait to watch season 3 when its available.Season 1 is very good also.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I can't really use it as I don't have a smart phone, mine is kinda dumb.  However, I wanted it because it is a nickname of mine so it personalizes my Kindle.  Crazy?  Maybe but hey it's my name!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this for my son whose eleven.He enjoyed the book and wrote a report on it for school.He is eager in reading the series.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|Not a bad movie. I gave it a three mainly because they took a lot of liberties with the real fact behind the rescue. The Canadians actually did more that the movie let on, and some things (people) were completely made up.
B0073U2FB2|5.0|The whole sci-fi part of the movie was amazing. The graphics and effects were great too. Me and my kids enjoyed this movie very much.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I think this is one of the best bond movie to date, or a least up their in the top 5 for me. Seemed to follow Fleming book bond more closely than the movies usually do.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I have a lot of authors that I REALLY LIKE, Kerrelyn Sparks has not quite made that list, but she is on the secondary one for sure!<br /><br />I must admit, even though I am a stickler for reading books in order, I read Wild About You before this one (and it was so good!).<br /><br />This was a good read, it wasn't a great read, there has been no shake up of my author lists, but this is a nice read, there are funny parts and sad parts, I am intrigued, I will be looking at the 2nd book to see how it goes.<br /><br />The dialogue was decent, I found the humor in the fang coming out, (sounds like a good idea for a halloween costume) and I have to say the blood substitute was a great twist on the vampire theme.<br /><br />To be honest I was in pretty deep with the vamps for a awhile. Twilight cured me!  They have to know they deserved all those Razzies.  Anyway, I digress. I have found so much more in the shifter, werewolf genre!  But I have to say, I am glad I read this one, it was worth it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I personally think that this book is very good. I like the series a whole lot. Great book for sure
B000JIHP88|4.0|So I guess that is was matters most. Her nursery is mostly pink, so I tried to find one that would match her decor and couldn't really find one so I started looking for one that has the best reviews. It keeps her entertained for about 20 minutes sometimes, which is pretty good for her, and she can fall asleep to it as well.<br /><br />However, beware of the packaging when you go to assemble this mobile. The items are sealed in bags but the tiny little screws that the animal pieces attach to are just loose in each animal piece bag and I didn't realize until too late and lost one. Just be careful.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A must read! I can recommend this book to everyone, the first of the series, quite interesting and catchy. Read it!
B009X01ELC|4.0|Good quality. a little hard to swivel but not to bad. Overall a nice product. about average price for product.
B0015DROBO|5.0|A must read! I can recommend this book to everyone, the first of the series, quite interesting and catchy, and the later volumes get more and more interesting
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Could be GREAT. But...cant change cover picture .  retrieveing photos stops constantly and takes FOREVER for pages to load!! please fix!! Other wise i love it!!
B002RHGYOA|5.0|A must read! I can recommend this book to everyone, the first of the series, quite interesting and catchy. Read it!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|How many times over the last 40 years have we had these posthumous release blues from the Hendrix family archives?  From Blues, South Saturn Delta, and Valleys of Neptune, to First Rays of the New Rising Sun, Live At The Fillmore East, and Winterland, Hendrix fans have endured money grab after money grab to the point where every year we just put some money back waiting for the Hendrix family to announce its next bit of table scraps they plan on tossing our way. To be fair, some, such as Winterland and Valleys of Neptune were nice collections, especially the fiery performances caught on the live Winterland. But in all fairness, Jimi Hendrix died in 1970 leaving us with three studio albums that changed the face of guitar and rock and roll forever. They showed a progression in not only his playing but his songwriting in just three short years that anyone would be hard pressed to repeat, ever. And only a handful of musicians and bands have done since. Basically, we didn't need all these posthumous releases. There's a reason they sat in a vault;  for the most part they weren't all the great. I don't think Jimi Hendrix would have put the majority of these albums out his family has deemed \\"Hendrix Family-Approved\\". So you can imagine my pessimism when late last year it was announced that yet another posthumous release was coming out.  What now?  Hendrix: Polka? Hendrix Live From Heaven? Hendrix Unleashed in the East? After hearing the first single, `Somwhere', pessimism turned to optimism. It was a slow burner. That classic Hendrix voodoo that permeated albums like Electric Ladyland and Axis: Bold As Love was all over this track that was recorded with Buddy Miles on drums and Stephen Stills on bass. Eddie Kramer at the helm, this was a classic Hendrix track that was finally seeing the light of day in a new, and much better light. So after hearing the album, I can say that without a doubt this is by far the best posthumous Hendrix release to take money from our wallets.  Does it stand up to those three classic and timeless Jimi Hendrix and the Experience releases? Not by a mile.  But there are some gems well worth owning on 2013s great money grab.<br /><br />The key to the success of People, Hell, and Angels is Eddie Kramer. This guy is the seminal producer and engineer of the 60s and 70s. He had a hand in all three of Hendrix's albums with the Experience. Kramer oversaw this posthumous release and you can tell. It doesn't have the sound of a quickly thrown together jumble of demos and raw tracks;  it sounds like the album that should've come out after the Experience broke up. `Earth Blues' opens with a sound of what was to come. More of a soul vibe, but still very much showcasing Jimi's cosmic blues playing. One of the best renditions of `Hear My Train A Comin\\" is on this album. There's an urgency to this version that hadn't been caught on tape since the acoustic version performed by Hendrix in the doc Hendrix. `Bleeding Heart' has some amazing `Little Wing'-like guitar and a great Chicago blues vibe to it. `Easy Blues' is a nearly six minute instrumental that is a glimpse of what Hendrix may have had in store for us had he kept recording through the 70s with Band of Gypsies. `Inside Out' is a funky number accentuated by some great Leslie speaker-infused guitar. The album falters on pseudo-soul yawner(and longest track) `Let Me Move You' and versions of `Izabella' and `Crash Landing' don't add much to the collection, besides being the best versions of these otherwise uninspired Hendrix leftovers.<br /><br />All in all, if you've already dropped a fortune on 40 years of Hendrix rehashes, then do yourself a favor and drop a few more on this surprisingly solid collection. Or, if you're like me,  you can just pull out Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold As Love, and Electric Ladyland and spin them in succession and at high volume. Your choice.es it stand up to those three classic and timeless Jimi Hendrix and the Experience releases? Not by a mile.

B0027MJU00|4.0|In true Gillian Flynn writing, she is able to encapsulate an array of emotions in her story. Dark places is so suspenseful and creepy, that I was left with an eerie pit in my stomach after I finished the last pages. This book will make you want to sleep with the light on and keep the doors double-locked!!

B0049J2BSM|5.0|Gabe loves this type of animation. Films like these grab his attention. The dialog is mature as well and he is learning new words.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Image so small and slow that could not  be played on Kindle Fire.  Do not recommend.  I  deleted it immediately
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Gabe saw this in the theater as 3 D. He can follow the plot better now and enjoys the characters...his favorite is Jack Frost, the hero...naturally.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was like being there.  The characters were awesome.  The romance was great!  The suspense kept you reading.  Like I said what a man.
B000HVHM5S|4.0|Good movies, nothing much to said here if you are interested in anti-gov movie then this is your movie to buy.
B002VE5472|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie with good plot twists! Lots of action and suspense. A bit graphic at times.<br />I loved that it was available to rent from Amazon! So convenient. The signal was clear, and the picture was a good-no problems with the streaming.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|What can you say about Indiana Jones, i saw them all and I really like them all. Hopefully they do another one.
B00973DDN2|5.0|This is another good album from a great band, although Hot Fuss is still my favorite so far. I got a great price too!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|5 batteries as described, packed and shipped promptly, will take too long to know if the batteries are cheap and don't last, so will give benefit of the doubt.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|It was hard to sympathize with the main character, even brillantly played by Denzel Washington. I realize that was the point, but it was just difficult.
1594744769|5.0|I haven't read the book.  I bought it for my daughter who has read it and said it was excellent.  The use of old pictures makes this fictional book seem real.
B004LTA6AU|1.0|This is a great CD - There isn't a bad Bob Marley CD out there - However, the last THREE songs were not on here.  I sent a message to the seller and never heard back from them.  I would suggest that before you purchase this CD, contact the seller to make sure ALL of the tracks are really there.  This was a new CD.

B000001FY9|5.0|Nothing else to say except this CD is so awesome.  I keep buying them for relatives and friends and they love it too!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Okay, only three seasons of the set have the 'Love & Marriage' opening song on their tracks, cheap, cheap, production company to not pay for it to be on all seasons DVD's, however, anytime you can pick up a DVD set that is over 5000 minutes for $40, what I picked it up for, pick it up!
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Blu-ray picture is amazing and that's a given when you buy a product in Blu-ray. As for the poor excuse to revert back to the original aired versions while for years I have been watching the extended ones on DVD, I'm very unhappy. It's my fault that I didn't research this before purchasing the set but if I had known before, I never would have spent the money on it. I'm only on season 3 and am contemplating not even watching anymore of them. Great quality picture is not worth the sacrifice of so many amazing jokes and scenes. I can't stand listening to it knowing a joke is missing. Poor performance to Warner Home Video. If the series can be made on DVD then it can also be made on Blu-ray. It should be worth the time and money to satisfy the true fans. Needless to say, I'm pissed!
B007SGM084|1.0|She felt the hype was undeserved and that the book was dull. Her impression was that regular romance novels would probably better suit the intended audience.

B009K72EP8|5.0|SPOILERS BELOW!  Do Not Read if you have not seen this season yet! I'm not going into detail how amazing this series has been, because if you're reading this, you already know how fantastic and how addictive Star Wars, The Clone Wars The Series has been.  Furthermore, I have really grown to love so many characters on this show.  I love Ahsoka Tano because she is always brave and she always wants to do what is best for others. And I even came to really like Asajj Ventress because she had so much spunk and personality, and even humor about her.  And, I really liked that she had decided to change from her evil ways. As of now, Season 5 has been the absolute best of all of the seasons. I was really, really looking forward to a 6th season until I found out that the show HAS BEEN CANCELLED!! Oh, how could they do this??  Because they are making Star Wars Episode 7?  That's a poor excuse, but apparently that may have something to do with it.  But, I did hear that the studio wants to make some kind of bonus arc episodes.  I hope it's true.  Probably it will be on DVD, but I guess we'll have to wait, and probably will have to wait a year to find out. I have to say looking back on this Season, I saw some major changes/shifts in this Season.  It made me wonder how they were going to continue the series.  For example:  All of Death Watch was mostly destroyed/dismantled, Obi Won's love interest was killed, Savage Opress was killed, Asajj Ventress was no longer the hateful revenge seeking person that she was, Ahsoka Tano decides to leave the Jedi Order after she is blamed and nearly convicted of murder, treason, etc. The finale ends with Anakin Skywalker stating that he had the same kind of feeling - that he too thought about leaving the Jedi Order.  Well, it's been a great run, and I'm still sad that they decided to cancel the show.  I just hope now, that this season will come out on DVD so that I can buy it.  I've really enjoyed the show.
034580404X|5.0|Gentlemen I suggest you read it too.  That way she'll be impressed with how much you've learned.  Seriously, you won't regret it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was a very very easy read.  Not the greatest literary work, but the story had me hooked and I just had to finish it.  It's a love story really, with a bit of mystery and intrigue attached.  People talk about the S&M, but I found that to be just a minor sub-plot and I sometimes just skimmed past those pages as there really was too much sex in these books. That was a bit overdone and got boring in my opinion.  I was more interested in the story itself.  The author frequently uses the same words and phrases, so that got tiresome too.  But as I said, a very easy read love story that was easy to lose myself in.  Sometimes that's just what we need.
B000TU16GS|5.0|Love all of the action I couldn't stop reading if you like books with action and suspense this is a great book for you.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|When I take a picture with my video camera, and load it into my ipad, while my friends are watching, and then show them the results, they are all awe sticken.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Very compelling!  The intensity level is like '24' when that first aired.  Easy to sit down and watch a lot of episodes in a row.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I didn't want to like this show.  I have enjoyed watching Holmes since I was a kid, and Jeremy Brett was THE Sherlock.  The modern BBC Sherlock is good in a different way, but it's hard to actually like the characters.  When I saw ads with a female Watson, I basically tuned in to watch the trainwreck...but it wasn't.  The show is so good, I bought a season pass so I could show the past episodes when we had guests who hadn't already seen the show.  Normally I would never pay so much for just the digital edition...this show is the exception.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|thank you, so much fun to play on breaks at work.  a nice, easy dungeon crawlers.  keep making 'em and I'll keep playing 'em.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Got this for christmas and everybody in the family loved watching the series. There are 8 discs in all. Great buy!
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|EDIT. A re-appraisal, after a few years:<br /><br />Music takes time to absorb and appreciate, and our opinions often change over the years. I must admit that my initial review of The Next Day was a little soft on criticism, perhaps because I was so excited about Bowie's return to music after 10 years of silence.<br /><br />Some of its praise still stands. These are some of Bowie's strongest lyrics: layered, literary, and yet evoking a passion that we hadn't heard in so long. Similarly, it's great to hear his devilish side again. Attempts to be tasteful so often yield bland results, so kudos to Bowie for getting a bit indulgent and theatrical. Some of the tracks on here rival the best moments of Outside.<br /><br />However, the ambitions of the album are undercut by formulaic song arrangements, lackluster production, and general glut. The album is too long, unfocused, and quite conservative despite its occasional referencing of old avant garde Bowie. I hate to speak ill of Tony Visconti, but the album would sound markedly better in the hands of another producer---and with some other musicians. In short, there are great ideas here, but also a need to get out of old habits and comfort zones.<br /><br />In truth, The Next Day is not all that far in sound from Bowie's last two albums---Heathen and Reality---yet it connects the sound of those albums to darker classics like The Idiot, Heroes, and Scary Monsters. If Heathen was a contemporary review of 60s pop Bowie, and Reality was a tasteful rumination of 80's rock Bowie, The Next Day is (mostly) a curator's take on Art Rock Bowie. Hopefully he makes more music in the future, but this (and the wonderful Sue/Tis a Pity release) nevertheless make for a great last testament to a beloved musician.<br /><br />************<br /><br />Here's a song-by-song breakdown:<br /><br />The Next Day:  The album kicks off with a taut, sneering rocker. Like &#34;Beauty & the Beast&#34; meets &#34;New Killer Star,&#34; but with a fantastically acrid vocal turn by Bowie, sometimes similar to his maniacal verses in &#34;The Supermen.&#34; Supposedly about a dying dictator, this is our long sleeping Giant reclaiming his throne in a brilliantly haughty fashion.<br /><br />Dirty Boys:  Like strip music for William Burroughs' mugwumps, this is sleazy, tense, off-kilter funk. Not far from what he made on Iggy Pop's The Idiot or Lodger, but this has a gleefully nasty attitude that stands apart from those works. Unfortunately, the song is kept from true greatness by flat production by Visconti.<br /><br />The Stars (Are Out Tonight): An underwhelming single, but it works well in the flow of the album. It's an accessible rocker with a hummable melody and tasteful string arrangement, yet &#34;Stars&#34; continues Bowie's defiantly bitter exegesis of contemporary life, here focusing on celebrity culture (something he appreciates and loathes in equal measure). It's fairly basic in structure, but the song is energetic and fun, and nicely carries the momentum.<br /><br />Love is Lost: Extremely tense minimalist rocker, somewhat akin to Wire, or maybe Gang of Four. Upbeat yet hypnotic, this is another highlight. Love the slashes of guitar throughout.<br /><br />Where Are We Now?:  I was scared about the prospect of TND after hearing &#34;Where Are We Now,&#34; but I it's now clear that Bowie's cracked, defeated voice here is simply one of several voices on the album. The song provides some much needed space after the claustrophobic opening tracks. It's the lone moment of plaintive, graceful beauty here, and as such is quite welcome.<br /><br />Valentine's Day: On the surface it's a breezy pop nugget, like the guitar-rock brother of &#34;Everyone Says Hi.&#34;. It has a silly chorus that's quite fun to chant. Were it not for the lyrics about a man's murderous rampage, &#34;Valentine's Day&#34; would feel out of place on this album. As it stands, this impish number fits right in.<br /><br />If You Can See Me: Bowie tries his hand at prog rock pomposity. Like a sequel to &#34;Look Back in Anger,&#34; as performed by Henry Cow or Magma. But not as satisfying as that might sound. It's a bold idea, not fully baked.<br /><br />I'd Rather Be High: Musically, this is achingly dull: basic midtempo rock, vaguely recalling some distant ideal of the 1960's. Lyrically, though, it's brilliant.<br /><br />Boss of Me: Revisiting some of his arena rock tendencies of the late 80's leads to the worst track on the album.<br /><br />Dancing out in Space: Things pick up again here. Spacy washes of guitar meet a stark nervy beat, like a Krautrock cousin to the earlier &#34;If You Can See Me.&#34; If &#34;Boys Keep Swinging&#34; were played by Neu!, it might sound something like this.<br /><br />How Does the Grass Grow: A wiry sequel to the opening track. This shares a rhythm with the vocal intro to Bowie's cover of &#34;Pablo Picasso,&#34; but has a playful menace similar to the upbeat tracks on &#34;Heroes.&#34; It's ecstatic and terrifying at the same time.<br /><br />You Will Set the World on Fire: Another arena rock anthem, this one with a Kinks-esque riff. This song will not set the world on fire.<br /><br />You Feel So Lonely You Could Die: An anthem dripping with drama, a taste of the old Bowie majesty. Aside from the nods to Ziggy-era songs such as &#34;Rock `n' Roll Suicide&#34; and &#34;Five Years,&#34; this almost sounds like something Leonard Cohen would write, cruel doo-wop backing vocals and all. Even here though, Bowie is not in a generous mood when it comes to prettiness. As grand as it is, the song is starkly arranged and feels quite frantic. All the better to jeer at you and your misery, my dear...<br /><br />Heat: Immediately reminiscent of the Walker Brother's &#34;The Electrician&#34; and Scott Walker's &#34;Jesse,&#34; but gives way to a more expansive and meditative feel, though still full of intense pathos. Walker has long been an important muse for Bowie, but here it almost feels like a full-on homage to his style, lyrics and all. Makes for a great closing track.<br /><br />*****************<br />DELUXE EDITION:<br /><br />Atomica: A fine little new wave rocker, though slight. The guitar riff recalls &#34;My Sharona&#34; by The Knack, and &#34;I Feel Much Better&#34; by The Small Faces. Like a few songs on TND, Bowie's vocal delivery is manic and tense, recalling earlier songs like &#34;Beauty and the Beast.&#34;<br /><br />Love is Lost (Hello Steve Reich Mix): James Murphy aka LCD Soundsystem remixes a track from the original album, and it's pretty good. Retaining the tension of the original, but giving it more of a groove. The splicing in of a classic Bowie melody halfway through the track is a welcome touch.<br /><br />Plan: A catchy instrumental, though it feels like the skeleton of what could have been a more fully fleshed-out song. In fact, maybe it was (see next).<br /><br />Informer: The drums of the previously released bonus track &#34;Plan&#34; are used here for a more proper rock ballad. I hear snatches of &#34;I Dig Everything&#34; in the verses, and a touch of &#34;Absolute Beginners&#34; in the arrangements. Still, it has that clipped, anxious vocal delivery that's all over TND. While it would fit reasonably well on the album, it wouldn't be an album highlight.<br /><br />I'd Rather Be High (Venetian Mix): It's basically just the original track with harpsichord parts running throughout. It robs the song of its '60s motif, and makes for a distracting listen.<br /><br />Like a Rocket Man: A devilishly bouncy number detailing the lives of folks strung out on coke and speed. Musically similar to &#34;So She,&#34; but more of an overt pop song than that modest charmer. It's actually closer in spirit to Valentine's Day and How Does the Grass Grow, all of them being batty pop ditties with surprisingly sinister undertones. This is the strongest of the newest tracks in my opinion, and would have made TND even stronger.<br /><br />Born in a UFO: Take the chorus of Born in the USA and graft it onto Bowie's tepid cover of Like a Rolling Stone (on Mick Ronson's album), and you get fairly close to this dud. Could have used a little more time in the oven.<br /><br />I'll Take You There: This previously released bonus track is a fun rocking anthem, very close in sound and approach to You Will Set the World on Fire. I much prefer this one though!<br /><br />God Bless the Girl: An uncanny fusion of &#34;Like a Prayer&#34; and &#34;Magic Dance&#34; that somehow still manages to sound urgent and moving, perfectly in keeping with TND. I wasn't sure about what to think of it at first, but now I think it's one of his best songs of this era.<br /><br />So She: Previously released extra, pleasant but not much else. Definitely sounds like a B-Side, albeit an enjoyable one.f recalls &#34;My Sharona&#34; by The Knack, and &#34;I Feel Much Better&#34; by The Small Faces.

0525953728|4.0|The book offers an excellent account for some of the greatest details in military hisory. It was well written and a great read. The problem I have with the book, is that I see it to be a betrayal on behalf of the U.S. military.There was information and tactics explained in the book that should have remained secret. I also dislike the author's downplay in President Obama's role in the whole ordeal and the appraisal of the SEALs. \\"Mark Owen' comes off as a bit pompous and egotistical toward the end of the book.

B0087JTAKW|3.0|THIS WAS A WELL WRITTEN STORY THAT WAS EASY TO READ.  I WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. The idea was solid.
B00B4VXQC8|2.0|Before all of the Bon Jovi fan club members jump on me (of which I'm a member), let me categorically state that I am a HUGE Bon Jovi fan...as a guitar player, Richie is one of my music idols -- ditto Jon for his song-writing.  In my opinion, they will go down as one of the best song-writing partnerships of all time.  Furthermore, as a guitar player, I play pretty much every song in their catalog.<br /><br />BUT....I hate to be honest...<br /><br />This is one of the worst albums they've come out with -- up there with THIS LEFT FEELS RIGHT, and BOUNCE...i was going to even through 7800 Fahrenheit in the mix because it is such a dark album -- but, at least a case could be made that 7800 was obviously a heavy metal / hard rock album.<br /><br />Except for \\"What About Now\\" and \\"That's What the Water Made Me\\", the rest of the songs on this new album are pretty bland and easily forgotten.  (By the way, am I the only one who thinks the opening drum solo to \\"That's what the Water Made Me\\" is almost identical to the opening drum solo of \\"Just Older\\"??)<br /><br />And while I realize that time moves on -- and with that it means music also changes with time -- does a band have to abandon most of it's musical roots?  I mean, wasn't Bon Jovi a heavy metal / rock band at one time??<br /><br />What happened to all of Richie's guitar solos?  There aren't nearly as many solos as there once used to be...And, of the few solos that we do hear, they certainly are not the booming, melodic, defining pieces of art that Bon Jovi (and Sambora) are known for...and that have defined Bon Jovi's music and greatest hits.<br /><br />Pop Question:  What's up with Jon's country accent when he sings?  You know what I'm talking about...that little twang that he developed from the LOST HIGHWAY album.  Did he go the way of Springsteen (southern accent), Madonna (British accent), and Tina Turner (British accent)??  Ok, maybe I'm being a bit dramatic -- but my point is clear.<br /><br />Truth be told, thecigarette smoking is killing Jon's voice -- he neither has the growl or vocal range he once had many albums ago.  Again, you all know what I'm speaking about.  Unfortunately, his voice -- quite often -- sounds very nasal...and with a southern twang.  That's ok though -- I can deal with Father Time and Jon singing a half-step lower in concert...I get it.  BUT, I need the music to grab me from the get-go and speak to me.  Instead of going from 0 - 150 MPH in 4 seconds with your hair on fire, a lot of the new stuff seems to chug along at a safe 50 MPH.<br /><br />Honestly, Bon Jovi hasn't come out with a really good album since HAVE A NICE DAY.  Before that, CRUSH and then THESE DAYS.  (Obviously, SLIPPERY and NEW JERSEY are in a class by themselves.)<br /><br />Fair disclosure, I actually liked LOST HIGHWAY and thought it was a great chapter in their great book of music...a great deviation from their normal genre, at the right time.  It's just that I didn't expect Jon & company to keep up with the relaxed, country feel...maybe it's because Jon's voice is limited to that genre of music (stylistically speaking).<br /><br />At the end of the day, the music on the new album seems a bit uninspired and the band seems to be going through the motions.  Rock anthems are fine -- but they have to rock...you know?  \\"Because We Can\\" is no comparison to previous anthems like \\"Prayer\\", \\"Wanted\\", \\"Bad Name\\", \\"Just Older\\", \\"Blood on Blood\\", or even the power ballad \\"I'll be There\\".<br /><br />Sorry guys, I still think that you're one of the greatest bands ever -- and again, I believe history will judge Bon Jovi / Sambora as one of the greatest writing duos in music...but you gotta get back to your roots...driving tempos, rocking melodies, and big guitar solos that have defined Bon Jovi.  Oh, a bonafide power ballad along the lines of \\"Bed of Roses\\" or \\"I'll be There\\" would be nice too.<br /><br />Mind you, if you want to also throw out some stuff along the lines of your other hiddengems like \\"Hey God\\", \\"Diamond Ring\\", \\"Dry County\\", \\"Heart Breaking Even\\", or, \\"Lie to Me\\", I'm ok with that too.<br /><br />Just because you're getting older and tired doesn't mean your music has be tired as well.<br /><br />Peace.
B00AFEY354|3.0|Emma Watson was the best thing about this movie,she gave it some life.  The half brother was an interesting character.  The main character was confusing.  All in all it was ok.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The tripod works as advertised and I really like it however there is one problem. The top part that fits in to the iPhone comes off of the three legs that are attached to a metal plate which when inserted into the top part limits the movement of the legs. You cannot outstretch the legs to create a wider stance, unless, you melt the plastic over the legs which limits the extension. THEN  the connecting plate fits deeper into the iPhone MATING part of the tripod. I had to use goop in order to secure the mounting plate to the iPhone adapter. I melted the plastic to allow the legs to open to a wider stance, by using a soldering iron. once i melted the plastic over where the legs would come out before applying a hefty glob of goop and pressing the legs into the iPhone adapter mounting plate, the tripod became very useful at a great price!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|touching and heartbreaking characters. could not put this book down.  not at all what i expected, but i loved this book.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson had some very big shoes to fill and as far as I am concerned, he did an awesome job.  For all those who feel short changed.. well Jordan was not going to finish the work and this was probably our best chance to finish an absolutely fantastic series.  No doubt there were multiple endings left by Jordan but this one pretty well wrapped up the many plot lines and saftisfied character resolution.  My hat off to Mr. Sanderson and to Mr. Jordan ... whew this was a fantastic journey.  Of all these series I have completed (most if not all that have been written) .. this is going to be a timeless classic that everyone will enjoy.  So read it all and enjoy an astounding piece of work from beginning to end.

I highlighted a large portion of the book in my Kindle! It is deep and ... entertaining reading, in my view.<br />A Black Swan is not necessarily a bad thing. Read the book to see why. :-)
B00843TZJ2|5.0|CSN are great.  The video is top quality and now I wonder why I waited so long to buy it.
0451450523|5.0|This was my favorite fairy tale / movie growing up.  As an adult, anytime I am sick I find myself drawn to the characters and fantasy of this amazing story.  The book does not disappoint.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Entertaining and thought provoking...if your willing to accept that we know almost nothing of our universe, and so anything is possible.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I was very moved by all of the imagery of life in the orphanage and how the lives if these two strangers can be so different yet they feel the same at this stage in their lives. I also loved the unexpected ending. I read through the last few chapters so quickly because I just had to know how it would all end. I was even moved to tears. Great Read!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There's ropes in this game which add to the fun.  There are more turns that are harder but are fun. I like the fact that you can work towards earning the diamonds<br />which adds to the challange of the game. It is cool!

B009VMN3RA|4.0|Interesting to hear all the history behind Shirley Maclaine. Big fan of hers, although this book made me think twice about her.
B003OUXECE|4.0|Thie book wasn't fast-paces, but it kept you interested and gave a haunting look at how Rapture was built, thrived, and ultimately fell. I liked the book a lot :)
B004U8VX2M|1.0|The acting was terrible. I could not warm up to the characters or get past the first episode. I was disappointed.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Awesome CD and it was a great deal on Amazon. Macklemore is a great artist. Can't wait to see what else he comes out with
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Loved it.  Very well done.  Excellent sound.  They are such an inspiration to their style of music.  Happy to have found it.
B008KZVNFS|4.0|This is NOT Downtown Abbey soap opera! Cumberbach and the cast are excellent. Stoppard has a very difficult task scripting a swamp of a book and mining it for its essential thrust. Which is an account of how the English governing class and World War 1 did for the British Empire. The story line follows the (usually) hysterical self absorption of ALL its characters. Teijens, the main character, an 18th Century Parsival is serially undone by his class - contemporaries. Ably abetted by his Madam Bovery of a wife.<br /><br />The problem wit the book is Ford Maddox Ford's writing approach. He attempts a series of impressionistic sketches around each character, trying, I suppose, to make a three dimensional image. Which fails and leaves us with a series of unsatisfying caricatures.<br /><br />Stoppard is a premier craftsman with an acute eye for scene setting and an ear for the defining dialog. I felt the second and third acts got as well into the story as is possible, setting up an excellent fourth act. Stoppard simply cuts the last book, which is, in any case, mostly another attempt to reprise the points Ford fails to ground in the first three books. Act 1 is problematic, if you read what Stoppard has to work with from the book. The characters are still caricatures, so that the events surrounding them seem like place holders for what might come out if Ford can, eventually find focus. (For me he never does.)<br /><br />I recommend this very fine production. Even for those who are not wild about BBC trawling English period drama for product, this is rather better than usual.
1582701709|5.0|This is a wonderful book and I have incorporated many of its theories into my life, and my life is going much better.
B000VHKE7Q|5.0|I doubt another review is necessary. Fournier was and still is one of the giants. For years my standard reference for unaccompanied cello was Casals. So intensely introverted and profoundly studied, I felt I'd never need to hear anyone else. But Fournier's cello and piano sonatas, with Frederich Gulda caught my eye and I, and this outstanding music led me to Fournier's 6 Cello Suites.<br /><br />We all get to this music along different paths and accumulate our own tastes and expectations. But, honestly, I doubt there is a richer, more honest and musically intelligent version out there. Certainly nothing I've heard produced more recently.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, the voices and the animation/graphics.  I believe this was a true labor of love with all involved
1433502410|5.0|I was looking for a study Bible that would show me not only explanations or additional information of the scriptures but also graphical representation of historical or textual items covered throughout the Bible (i.e. maps, temple architecture etc).

B009E3EY4M|5.0|Being born post-Led Zeppelin split, this is as close as I've come to witnessing a Led Zeppelin concert in person.  The footage is clear and doesn't jump all over the place like some concert films so you get a great view of each performer doing their thing. I hope you have a decent sound setup to fully enjoy the blazing guitar and thumping drums. In my opinion, Jason Bonham on drums is the highlight of the show - he's got heavy hands like his father and does an amazing job of filling the absence.  You can tell how truly moved he is to be a part of this magic at the end of the show.  Must-have for any fan of rock and roll.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|I liked this game at first but once you get the gold trophy the pretty much you are done as there is nothing further to achieve
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Good Special effects.<br />Great scientific parallels and suspense.<br />The stories were connected but were not always predictable. I could hardly wait to see the next one.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|This movie was as great as the others were. A lot of surprises along the way. Looking forward to the next one in the series. If there is to be one, that is. I'm hoping.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|This movie is nothing like the first two of the new series. There's just to much story to be told, to many ups and downs and when you think it's going to end, it doesn't end! By the time Batman wins (as expected), you're already tired of it and it's not as surprised about the really surprising ending as you should be.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very simple and nice to use...The app fits the whole screen and the numbers are big enough to see...The calculator is used for basic math procedures...For instance, addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication...
B004GJIL34|4.0|The movie is very explicit and crude. The story is moving and I like in general the way they tell it. But It don't like that it does not have one thread, so that makes it difficult to follow.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game. Like the time management aspect of it. Wish you could buy gems with coins. It would make it better. Also, I'm not a fan of when the ads come up. I don't mind ads, but hate when they come up in the middle of a mini game.

B007ZTLLMK|4.0|This is a fun game for my kids.<br />But for me? meh.<br /><br />Pros - The controls are nice, easy to use.<br />Cons - There is no momentum, inertia, yaw, etc. I was looking for something to feel more like flying a real RC heli so this didn't really do much for me.<br /><br />But again, the kids love it and it is a decent game.

B00AO686MY|5.0|Classic line. Classic flick.<br /><br />The claims that this edition has been censored are generally correct. In the opening scene, where Baby Herman sticks his hand up the dress of the script girl (?), his middle finger is extended on the LaserDisk. On the Blu-ray, it's been redrawn so it isn't extended. In the scene where Jessica is thrown from the car, there are several frames on the LV in which &#34;something&#34; is visible between her legs. On the BD, these frames have been redrawn to hide or remove whatever that &#34;something&#34; is. Thanks to Paul Mular for kicking me to confirm this. (Though Toons leave paint behind when they rub against rough surfaces, and can be dissolved with a mixture of turpentine, acetone, and benzene, there is no explanation of their ontogeny. The idea that what is apparently a man-made image can reproduce is strange, to say the least. As they can move around in the human world, I guess it's not unreasonable to grant them &#34;reproductive rights&#34;.)<br /><br />&#34;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&#34; (there's no question mark, as Hollywood believes question marks are an audience turn-off) is based on Gary Wolf's fantasy novel &#34;Who Censored Roger Rabbit?&#34; (&#34;censored&#34; meaning &#34;murdered&#34; -- Roger is Not A Nice Toon). In Wolf's story, comic strips are created by photographging Toons. (One shudders at the thought of a Dondi Toon.) This misses the far more pregnant conceit that Toons are characters in animated films. Combining this with &#34;racial&#34; discrimination against Toons, and a &#34;Chinatown&#34;-like story about the destruction of Los Angeles' trolley lines to make room for automobiles, resulted in an animated film with adult substance. It's a classic.<br /><br />The three Roger Rabbit shorts are included. They've never struck me as particularly funny, but I've become quite grumpy (and perhaps a bit dopey) in my declining years.<br /><br />&#34;Roger Rabbit&#34; is easily the equal of anything made during Hollywood's &#34;Golden Age&#34;. We finally have it in a format that does justice to its innovative visual effects.<br /><br />Image & Sound Quality<br />--------------------------<br />I have both the LV and DVD of &#34;Roger Rabbit&#34;. This edition looks less contrasty (probably a good thing) and a bit lighter (which will likely provoke complaints). Though in color, &#34;Roger Rabbit&#34; is stylistically film noir, but the BD isn't as atmospherically dark as we expect such films to be (and as I remember it). Excerpts in the supplemental material show a noticeably darker film. You might wish to experiment with your display's Black Level setting.<br /><br />This lends credence to the belief that the people doing Disney transfers are less interested in the original looked like, than what looks good to them, or might please a newer audience. I suspect this new edition is taken from the composite negative (not a print), and no comparison was made with projection prints. (It's worth noting that Zemeckis's &#34;Back to the Future&#34; trilogy was transferred to Blu-ray from freshly struck prints -- not negatives. Clearly, Zemeckis wanted the home video to resemble the theatrical presentation as closely as possible.)<br /><br />Disney seems to be paying attention to videophiles who don't want grain reduction or edge enhancement. Grain /is/ visible, but it's fine and tight. Thank you, Disney!<br /><br />The DTS-HDMA 5.1 soundtrack is quite clear; I can understand more of the dialog than in previous editions. The sound has a rich, &#34;round&#34; quality, appropriate for film noir.<br /><br />Supplemental Material<br />-------------------------<br />This includes running commentary with Fleischman, Zemekis, Marshal, and others; a brief &#34;making of&#34; with Fleischamn; an extended making-of; the deleted &#34;pig head&#34; sequence; and shots of how rubber figures stood in for the Toons on live-action sets. The running commentary is especially good, with a great deal of interesting material.Marshal, and others; a brief \\"making of\\" with Fleischamn; an extended making-of; the deleted \\"pig head\\" sequence; and shots of how rubber figures stood in for the Toons on live-action sets.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|What a wonderful story. I thoroughly enjoy it. The differences from the movie were strange at first, but quickly forgotten. This may be one of my all time favorite stories.
B004R1Q296|4.0|Tuchman calls this work \\"A Distant Mirror\\" yet shows on numerous occasions Tuchman shows that this mirror of our society is, indeed, not so distant.  The institutions and conventions of modern civilization have their roots in the late Middle Age kingdoms of Europe.  The ways we differ are insightful, as well.  For example, knights, retainers, squires, mercenaries and common people all fought for a person -- their King or Prince or Duke -- and not for the concept of \\"country.\\"  With the advent of modern weapons, knights and noble warriors were not as dominant over commoners who began to use matchlock firearms and eliminate the knight's superiority on the battlefield. This led to larger armies and the emergence of nation building.<br />Tuchman's approach of following one noble family in northern France during the 1300's is efficient and effective.  Her style is readable, with just the right amount of facts concerning life in the Middle Ages.  It is full of calamities, many of which still haunt us today.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story in this book was heart warming. The fight of a scared women and the love of a broken man couldn't fit more perfectly together. Tears kept flowing. Beautiful. A true and wonderful read.

B00B2QA646|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I loved the transitions between scenes.  Keira Knightley plays her typlical type cast self, but all in all I liked this abridged version of the story.  Didn't need to be rated R.

B00B23O96A|3.0|'Old sock' (terrible title, comfortable as an old sock?!?) carries on from where his previous record 'Clapton' left off being a mixture of old standards, blues, more modern rock songs etc - only this is even more of a dog's breakfast - as though Eric has said \\"I'm going to record exactly what I want regardless of what it all sounds like...\\"  To be fair much of it does sound very good and there is certainly plenty of variety here, from the lovely lilting version of Taj Mahal's \\"Further on down the road\\" which opens the album, to the mush of \\"The folks who live on the hill\\" to the old timey version of Leadbelly's \\"Irene goodnight\\" and the reggae lite of the original song \\"Every little thing\\".<br /><br />The basic line up is his road band including Steve Gadd, Willie Weeks, Doyle Bramhall II and Chris Stainton with the addition of coach loads of session men (including Greg Leisz, Walt Richmond, Jim Keltner and Gabe Witcher) as well as famous faces including Sir Paul Macca, Steve Winwood, Taj Mahal and JJ Cale.  Eric is in good voice throughout and the album's other original track \\"Gotta get over\\" also features female backing singers like a throw back to his 70s albums. When I last saw him on tour he featured a version of Gary Moore's \\"Still got the blues for you\\" as a tribute to the recently deceased guitarist and that same version, mainly played on acoustic guitar, also appears here.  Eric revisits his country side with a relaxed reading of Ray Charles' \\"Born to Lose\\" and also covers the jazz standard \\"All of me\\".  I'm afraid that overall I found the album a bit too diverse with a bit too much 'mush', although there is also a lot here to like and my favourite track was probably \\"Further on down the road\\" which also contains the albums best guitar solo in its final coda. Three and a half stars.

B0059R5Q08|3.0|I am not a big writer or critic of movies.  These writers did the best job I have seen of trying to fit in all the aspects of the book into 2hours. The scenes inside Thornfield were bright and visual, much less dark than other adaptations.  That being said, I didn't like the fact that they chose to make it from a flashback point of view.  Someone who didn't know the story would've been quite confused.  I was disappointed in the lack of chemistry between Jane and Mr Rochester.  The proposal scene was blah and rushed.  The scene after the wedding was better, but then the end was quick and had literally no lines.  Disappointing.

B0076DCT2G|1.0|Ignoring the fact that John Corey is just a lousy character, the author repeats himself constantly sneaking up to the 90% marker when we finally get to the action.  So if you're looking for action, pick a different book.  If you need to remember why you read literature instead of entertainment, read this book.  I remember now.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is an okay game for awhile.  Holds your interest but after a while, it gets a little boring. It is good for a change.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I SAW HIM ON THE 'JAY LENO SHOW', WITH HIS MUSIC. THIS IS A GREAT SET OF MUSIC, RIGHT FROM THE BEACHES, THE STREETS, THE MOUNTAINS, AND THE VERY MYSTIC OF JAMACIAN MUSIC, AND IT'S HEART.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy this one.  It is fun, and challenging.  Of course all the kids can do the game better than me, but I like trying.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|A GREAT SET OF MUSIC FROM THE ORIGINAL LED ZEPPELIN GROUP. THIS MIGHT BE YOUR LAST CHANCE TO GET AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL BAND PERIOD. CODA!
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|I learned about her with all the media publicity.  She was a wonderful voice, and this song &#34;I dreamed a dream&#34; was just beautiful.  Highly recommend CD.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Night Visions far exceeded my expectations!! Radioactive & Bleeding Out are my favorite songs Almost every song on this CD gets heavy rotation on repeat! No fluffy cheesy stuff here!  I highly recommended this CD!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Excellent movie.  This is the fourth in the Twilight series.  I would love to see more movies like this one.  Delivery was prompt.
B008EKOO46|3.0|While the subject is interesting, I felt the writing was aimed at a less sophisticated audience.  This might be good for a middle school reader.
B000V9KFLY|3.0|This CD is OK.  There are some good songs and some not so good.  For Celine fans I recommend previewing before buying.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I've loved the show/movie forever and was not disappointed by the commemorative edition. The making of short is a nice feature that provides a little look into behind he scenes.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I got caught up in the Twilight series.  All the series movies are great.  Of course, I am a sucker for romance.
0740797719|4.0|This heavily illustrated book presents excellent information on the way that light works and is perceived.  It has generous examples of the use of color to portray light, especially for painting. A good index helps access to problem-solving.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I think I have all their CD's except for their Christmas.  That will be next.  I love their music and would recommend any of their CD's.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|We did not like this movie at all. It was terribly boring and did not hold our interest at all.
0446678430|3.0|These books are OK.  I think it would be better taking a class somewhere than reading these books.  You may learn more from the classes.
B006ID6UAW|4.0|Well written and very interesting book. The author takes us from the 18 Century up to recent times and gives a<br /> very insightful description of how the great statesmen of each period conducted diplomacy. His breadth of knowledge and entertaining way of presenting it serves the reader well. His description of the motives and psychology behind the decisions culminating in the major events of history gives us a new and better way to understand them. This book is easy to read though may benefit in some chapters being made more concise. I recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of the events that led to both world wars and that are shaping the world we live in today.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I love this group and all their music.  I hope they continue to produce more great songs.  I recommend any of their CD's.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I don't want to spend too much time reviewing because I want to download book two and read more. A new idea...which I love. It does take some time to get into the story, but we'll worth it.
B0013FFMOK|3.0|I don't like this movie as well as some of his other movies.  I really don't care for this type of movie.  Others may move it.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|This movie takes twists and turns you don't see coming. Very entertaining. It mixes all elements of life. Good and bad.
B0013A1T8I|2.0|I just could not get into this movie.  I might be good for teenagers but more for me.  I could not even finish watching the movie.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|Need I say more? This movie has all of our favorite lines and quirkiness.<br /><br />&#34;But my lips hurt real bad!&#34;
0743201140|1.0|I found out this book is in good shape however there's supposed to be a document in the back of the book which brings the book's concepts to life by testing the reader.  This was missing from the book probably because it was used.<br /><br />I won't make that mistake again.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|No one book contains the holy grail of happiness, but this one makes very easy to understand how to possibly love and be loved in an otherwise hopeless relationship.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Just what I was looking for.  Great color.  Protects well.  Highly recommend purchasing this case for the kindle fire.  A+
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory has become one of my favorite shows to watch.  I love that I can just click a few buttons and within a matter of days have my product and at such a great price too!!
B007SGM084|5.0|The books were excellent, they were very well written. Very interesting and a great story line. I hope to read more from this author in the future.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It was OK but I really didn't see where it was anything special.  I think Les Miserables was a much better movie!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle was an amazing soldier and an amazing man. He is an American military hero and saved the lives of probably hundreds of his fellow servicemen with his skills and selfless acts. Whether you agree with his attitude towards war or towards killing the enemy, he was clear that he was only interested in saving the lives of soldiers and ridding the world of evil one shot at a time. Mr.  Kyle was a soldier, not an author, however. The writing was simple and matter of fact, if not a bit scattered and disorganized at times. But as a result, you get the heart and soul of this hero and you see what kind of person he was. Excerpts provided by his wife also give a glimpse of how Mr. Kyle's time overseas and in training effected his family. Overall a great story and must read for anyone interested in snipers, SEALs, or heroes.<br /><br />We should all pay some sort of tribute to this man, no matter how large or small, and to all of our military men and women and their families for sacrificing so much for their country and for each other.
B004G600A4|5.0|I love this sow is is very cute.<br /><br />I also received this order when I expected it and in the condition that was expected.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all three books and was very sad when they ended because it left me wanting more, much much more!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it traps you completely. The type of book you do not want to put down once you start reading it.<br />Compared to the first two books of the Hunger Games Saga, I have to admit it was not my favorite but I did enjoyed it.<br /> There is actually nothing to criticize about this book. However, from my point of view, I think many characters desserved to be alive. that was the only thing by far i didnt like.<br />if you like reading adventure, suspense and a little of teenage romance this book is definitely for you.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|App hasn't been syncing with google tasks for weeks and yet there are no updates. I liked it quite a bit when it wasn't working, but I prefer typing my to-do lists on the computer (since that is faster). Not being able to sync renders this app next to useless for me.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great series for any SciFi fan...!  It was very nice to be able to watch it without commercials!!
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Growing up in the 80's, I was a big fan of the Kevin Bacon original, but this one kind of seemed a little better. Maybe it's just the way movies are made now, and maybe the story was told a little better, filling in and expanding on gaps the original missed. This one did a great job of keeping with the storyline of the original, even keeping a lot of the original music, although updated a little bit. Maybe I'll have to re-watch the original to see if I missed something when I saw it last, 15 years ago or so. If you haven't seen this one yet, do so.
B00AHXIC50|2.0|I am Not very impressed. only 2 songs are worth listening to. Glad I only paid two dollars for it.
