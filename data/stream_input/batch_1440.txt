B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used to love this app but then they got some sponsors and put the ad banners across the top so it covers the name of the city. Makes the weather info worthless - they might as well put another banner down the side and cover the temperature. Uninstall.
1932100660|1.0|After hearing vegans and vegetarians crow on and on about this book, I picked it up at my local library and read through it. Not only does it not present much in the way of actual science, but the study it draws it's title from comes to much different conclusions as I found out later when looking up the original data, and so should you by finding it here:<br /><br />(Chen J, et al. Diet, life-style, and mortality in China: A study of the characteristics of 65 Chinese counties. Oxford, UK; Ithaca, N.Y. Oxford University Press; Cornell University Press, 1990)<br /><br />Check it out for yourself.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, there was a 29% reductive risk of cancer in the populations that ate more meats. Dr. T. Colin Campbell also withheld information about his rat studies where protein deficiency prevents the liver from successfully doing its detoxifying duties, less aflatoxin gets converted into cancer-causing metabolites, but the end result is massive tissue damage that is virtually fatal. So yeah it protects you from cancer, sort of, but it does it at a horrific price; your good, healthy cells also die off and your liver quits on you.<br /><br />Other people have cited Denise Minger's and Dr. Chris Masterjohn's deconstructions of Campbell conclusions, and those deconstructions are spot on about what is wrong with his book and his essentially religiously dogmatic attempts to push a vegetarian/vegan diet, even if it means twisting the science data in the process. I highly recommend looking up their reviews and their various replies to Dr. Campbell and his followers who attacked them.
B0054JELS4|5.0|The order placed quickly, and was processed promptly. We received  our order in about 7-10 days. It came in good shape,and we have enjoyed it since
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game! I just wish you could unlock the games faster. the variety of the games is great. I could play it all day. the sudoku game is my favorite. I also love all the ways you can get points. I'm getting some right now for doing this.
0618918248|5.0|This book just has to be the one that I enjoyed the most in my life. Filled with criticism, rational thinking, solid arguements, quotes from the most brilliant physicists and well-known thinkers/philosophers... all of that, mixed with a bit of sarcastic humour, made up an excellent piece of work. It's worth reading several times. No wonder it became a bestseller. I'm really grateful to Richard Dawkins, his whole team, and, of course, Amazon, who gave me the only chance that I could have to purchase this book.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I love this on kindle fire and my droid But picking new colors if your hand misses abut your stuck!!! please change this!! Add a &quot;are you sure you want these colors or change selection&quot; button. Waisted all that time for four shades of blue.....argh!
B000QUEHNK|5.0|This was an interesting and fun novel. I would not have read it because of the title - which it turns out is an appropriate title. I am looking forward to more by the same author.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Yes, this is supposed to be a true story, and in reality you get the bang for the money is this movie. While it might be a little bit slow in the beginning and you need to pay attention to the dialogs, by the end you're all in. This movie might upset you, might make you think about the hope of your situation, if you're involved in politics, might make you decide to stand for what you believe in, for truth, although many people say that truth is relative. This movie might radicalize you, and hopefully, it might do it in the right direction.<br /><br />There is a right and wrong, there is a truth and a lie. This movie has both elements, which one you will see is the question.<br /><br />Excellent actors, incredible roles, amazing story. Encouraging.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|This movie doesn't know what it is. There's funny situations but its not funny not even in a clever way. There's action but it's more bad boys 2 than Mr. and Mrs. Smith. There was dynamic plot twists, however it was more ridiculous than italian job but with none of the background and character development that makes it fun or suspenseful.<br /><br />This movie has smuggling, Drugs, fights, a high end art heist, good actors, a hot chick (they made ugly?!), decent budget and camera effects, all things I love and anticipated and its still falls on its face. It must have been a combination of written, produced, and directed by too many people that didn't get along.Everyone on set had uncontrollable attention spans. Fell short of usable material so only able so they brainstormed and added in what everyone wanted to fill that extra 45 minutes that should have never made it past editing. If there is a directors cut I hope its nothing like what I saw in theaters.
0345529057|1.0|I love this series and was anxious to get into the books. Bought the paperback four book set version and what a disaster. My eyes burned after the first page. My eyes are fine, it's mass produced mess. Flimsy book. Extremely small and fine print. Buy the hardback.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|like I said on the tittle. its not the best game but I will play it. it also takes for ever to kill the zombies so ya I'm lazy and low in patience
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game with nice graphics.  like the, reverse feature.  one of my favorites when i am problem solving... it helps me think out of the box.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think for being freebies there very cool. I can let my kids play with no worries. Wish you could get more point faster to play more.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|FINALLY PPL THIS IS A BIG BIG DEAL GET THIS NOW OR ELSE.  . . . . . . . . . . .
0345803485|1.0|I decided to read this book on a whim..which should teach me: don't chose on whims..anyway- I was very disappointed.The plot is trite and vapid.The characters- essentially this is Twilight,the porno version.Possibly even more poorly written (if possible).There is no character development.Then again, there are no real dimensional characters...It is poorly plotted- with an obscene amount of repetitive gratuitous sexual manoeuvres which are depicted with about as much panache as one might expect from a back street porno.The female protagonist - if one could call her that- is rendered in such a manner as to provoke ire- why,oh why??? is she such a clearly vacuous individual,colourless at best- YET- she \\"snags\\" Seattle's most eligible bachelor? Really??? And PLEASE- stop with using beguiling already! Or get a new thesaurus- I do NOT recommend this as a read to anyone..I am rather ashamed I bought it and (sigh) wasted my time...I don't like to really blast anyone's work- but this- the is a travesty and SO poorly written and executed- don't waste your time with this \\"work\\"- if you are bored, read the back of a cereal box instead- it has more of value:(
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this!!! its the best solitaire game that ive found so far! it is very addicting I cant stop playing it!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 2 was the best and keep you really glue to the TV.  Can't wait for Season 3 back on TV in the Fall!  Now we will finally know who's the father of this baby in Season 3.  Very interesting also excellent cliff hanging at the end of Season 2. ALso, I really hope that Mom will keep eye on Carl who seem keep getting into troubles even he was told not to do even his childhood is gone forever.
9889979942|5.0|Tom Carter's book `China - A Portrait of a People' is a breath of fresh air. As a post-doctoral researcher of Chinese affairs at the University of Tokyo, it is unfortunate to see so many books neglect the visual realities of life inside the world's most populous state. All too often, scholars and observers are bombarded with cold facts and descriptions which, though impressive in their detail, do not adequately portray the color, richness, diversity, and complexities of everyday life for the PRC's citizens. Carter's book does justice to the expression `A picture tells a thousand stories' with its carefully balanced and comprehensive montage of the daily joys, tragedies, routines, and hardships of the rising dragon's 1.3 billion people, 56 ethnic groups, and 33 distinct regions. Each colorful page is accompanied with a brief story about that page's characters and location as well as the author's hands-on accounts of his nationwide experiences over the course of four years.  Of particular interest was Carter's stark and sometimes shocking visual portrayal of the evident challenges and contrasts within the rising dragon as China's leaders attempt with increasing difficulty to maintain one-party rule, to address the striking wealth divide, and to hold the state together amid unprecedented changes.  The plight of a severely burned and uninsured factory worker (Page 26) sharply collides with the life of a tattooed and care-free urban teen depicted on Page 523. For all these reasons, this book goes beyond the word heavy and often generalized guides written from behind the safety of a western desk. As a teacher and a researcher, I would gladly recommend this book to those seeking a sincere understanding of those who make China what it is, its people.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its alright I think for being free its actually pretty chill ibwould recommend it and stuff for sure dude like yeah isn't bad
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|While I enjoyed the first two installments of The Hunger Games Series, it seemed to me that little effort was put into the development of the story and characters in this poor attempt to bring closure to what could have been a great story.<br /><br />I don't need a happy ending, but I do need an ending.  This book didn't deliver.<br /><br />Why did I have to read all of Katnis' questions yet not get any answers?<br /><br />Why not an entire section dedicated to the trial so some of those questions could be addressed?<br /><br />I'm hoping the author was on a tight deadline and this wasn't done on purpose.<br /><br />Save your time and money.<br /><br />This will probably be one of those rare cases when the movie is better than the book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is great to waste time, which was exactly what I wanted. The games are easy but it's fun to beat your highest score.
B002XTXFU8|2.0|Do not be fooled by the title and box art; Bronson is an art house character study that fails on  both fronts. Tom Hardy gives a great performance but is let down by the direction and script. Despite the copious amount of exposition you never have a great understanding of the character or his motivations, at best you have a shallow depiction of a seriously flawed individual. At the end all you know is the guy wanted to be famous.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love EverNote. I use it for everything! I love making all my list on this app and can keep it all together in one place.
B005J4TLQG|3.0|Attack the  Block is an average film all around. There was a lot of hype surrounding this film after it was screened on the indy circuit, but its just not a special film. The actors just do not deliver a convincing performance and the story of an alien invasion that some how goes unnoticed despite the bodies left strewn about and the bio-luminescent fangs, claws , and blood surrounding a neighborhood just is to much to swallow.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Hey there! I am a huge fan of The Big Bang Theory. I've seen Seasons 1-3 and all of them are great! Must watch!<br /><br />I was just wondering if this season has audio and subtitles in Portuguese? I was wondering because in the amazon specs of Season three it only says that it has French and Spanish but once you buy the DVD you realize that it has Portuguese audio as well.<br /><br />Obrigado!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great message, Well made movie and well worth purchasing!  I'm 27 and as soon as the movie came to an end I wanted it to start over from the beginning.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I really liked this fast moving retelling of the Cinderella fairy tale. I can't wait to see what happens in the subsequent books and whether Cinder gets vindication against the evil Queen Levana. There were good twists and turns and the action moved quickly. The story had all the elements of a great story: a good villain (a few, actually), a love object (handsome prince), the under dog, and of course funny and witty dialogue. Very realistic and very fun. Loved it!
0439023521|5.0|Very good reading experience.  In some ways better than the first book.  Starts off a little slow, but action builds as the book progresses.  the ending is a real surprise.
B001EN1R2M|5.0|Raw, aggressive and not too polished, what good rock music should be. I discovered this gem from my college roommate after Theater of Pain came out and I'd worn out my Shout At The Devil record(!). With those other 2 albums having been issued on major labels and professionally produced, I honestly didn't know what to think at first. Then I read the back story, about how the band produced and recorded it themselves on a shoestring budget, and warmed up to it immediately. The raw intensity is what makes this album so appealing. Granted, the production values aren't like the other albums, but this is a young, hungry band clawing it's way out of the gutter, and it shows in the music. Strangely enough, this album was re-mixed by a professional producer when the band signed to Elektra, yet still remains its grittiness. The original mix is available on the box set \\"Music to crash your car to, vol. 1\\", which I highly recommend, and prefer. But this is definitely a great litmus test before shelling out for a box set. Sorry for rambling, just buy the #$%^&*(* thing!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|AMAZING!  We love it at all ages! The graphics are crystal clear and extremely detailed! Truly awe inspiring!  We are completely addicted to this game and play it all the time!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well worth the 99 pennies. Not always the most challenging,  but I think the point is that the game is suppose to br relaxing....it succeeded perfectly. It is also very beautiful. Well done who ever made this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good game and is royalty rewarding of the five stars that i am giving it. I play it allmost every day
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The case and holster for my razor are exactly what I expected from the manufacturer.  This is the best case and holster on the market period.
B007549W62|5.0|I'll start by saying I purchased this film because I respect Milo Ventimiglia's previous work and figured I'd give it a chance. I'm not usually one for post-apocalyptic films as I often find them too depressing to watch so I wasn't expecting to really care for it but this film really blew me away.<br /><br />This movie is dark. Dark, intense and very powerful. It's full of things we all fear but most of all it encompasses the depravity of human beings when put in a situation such as what befalls the characters in this film. The cover of the movie itself should be enough to tell you that this isn't going to be a happy film. Blood, violence and even a considerable amount of rape are all in this film and it's all done so very intensely! This film shows you the horrifying and frightening things people will do to each other in order to survive, when crammed into the basement of an apartment building. This movie didn't hold back. The characters didn't hold back.<br /><br />Milo Ventimiglia's character of \\"Josh\\" was absolutely brilliant as was Lauren German who played \\"Eva\\". Ventimiglia's performance went above and beyond. The transformation that Josh goes through is just unbelievable and so very dark, that it left me really speechless. I have to say, this is probably Milo's best work yet.<br /><br />The Divide is raw and has a very gritty feel to it, which I really liked. The director did a fantastic job, in my opinion. It's certainly not for everyone but for those who can appreciate a dark and intense film like this, should really give it a shot. I thought it was absolutely brilliant and I'm glad I purchased it. It gets five stars from me.
0545305497|2.0|The pages of this trilogy were spotted in some places - looks like ink smears maybe (???)<br />not up to standard quality
1400063515|1.0|Taleb presents a great idea. Outliers are important. Often they have changed human history.<br /><br />But they are important because they are outliers. In probability theory common things happen commonly. That also means that sometimes uncommon things also happen. Sometimes these are big events, that is also understandable and completely fits the concept. Since some uncommon events are big and because they are unforeseen they can have huge consequences. Just remember a whole lot of small but uncommon events also happened and we simply ignored them.<br /><br />So while Taleb's assertion that some uncommon and big events have huge impact on human history is interesting and true, this is hardly the basis to abandon the understanding that common things happen commonly. That is what he keeps arguing throughout the book and is tedius.<br /><br />The style of writing is simply awful. For exactly 200 pages the authors keeps on giving examples and making the point that uncommon events are so big that we should probably ignore the common ones. This is liberally interspersed with dumping on just about anyone who is not Nassim Taleb. This was irritating since most of the time the author really doesnt argue ideas but simply just dumps.<br /><br />That said. I want my $10 and 3 hours back. Hindsight, I probably could have finished the book in about an hour but kept on going back to see if I missed anything. I hadn't.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|The package arrived on time and then I could not hardly wait until I started the journey! I had seen glimpses over the two years it was on television but unfortunately I did not start at the beginning so I never got that involved into it. What a rare gem I found when out of curiosity, I decided to start viewing the beginning episodes on Hulu. I deeply fell in love with season 1 and unfortunately our internet did not afford for me to continue to watch it so the next thing to do was order Season 1 and 2 DVDs on Amazon. I was going to pace myself by watching them but I couldn't lay them down. So over the course of the next two days I watched both seasons. I cannot understand how in the world any network could have let this go. What an amazing story, gifted acting and I love how it just draws you in! I am 51 years old and this by far is one of the best scify, fantasy shows I have seen in a very long time. The acting is impeccable and there is so much heart and action scences in the storyline.<br /><br />I hope truly that some network will pick up this truly magnificent story and continue Richard, Kahlen, Zed, Cara and Darken Rhals story!
1843106698|5.0|Tony Attwood is the patron saint of \\"Aspies\\" and this book holds true to his dedication to, and total understanding of, those of us with Asperger's Syndrome.  His understanding of all aspects of Asperger's Syndrome is astounding and he is particularly gifted in his understanding of girls with Asperger's Syndrome.  He totally \\"gets it\\" when it comes to theory of mind and emotions in Asperger's Syndrome.  Would that all therapists could understand and have the knowledge he has and so clearly presents in this encyclopedic covering of AS.<br />Reading Tony Attwood's guide brought me to tears-- that someone could care so much about those of us with the syndrome and understand us so well.  He explained me to me in ways no one else had and eventually brought me to the point of getting officially diagnosed at age 61.  \\"Congratulations, you have Asperger's syndrome!\\" says it all.  He accepts the syndrome as a different way of thinking and feeling which is presented in a positive light, without making light of the difficulties involved in having AS.  He understands that the diagnosis often brings relief, particularly for those of us who fell through the cracks and were never treated, and carried lots of guilt and poor self-image for our \\"failings.\\"<br />Can't recommend this book highly enough for all those who need to understand AS-- therapists, parents, teachers and, last but by no means least, for those who have AS.
B006QKJQM6|4.0|Kung Fu Panda 2 was totally awesome and very entertaining. The characters were colorful and lively.  I would reccommend it for the whole family as it was good and enjoyable.
0345803485|1.0|I had no clue what this book was about and had heard nothing of it when a friend purchased it. She told me it was a romance book like Twilight (strike 1) and that I should check it out.<br /><br />I began chapter one and found the typical vapid prose of someone that had no earthly idea what they are talking about (strike 2). And I could not stand how one dimensional the characters are from the very beginning.<br /><br />Then came the sex (Strike 3). I tossed the book across the room, cursing loud enough for the neighbor to hear.<br /><br />I doubt I will ever speak to my friend again. I mean, how in good conscience, could I be friends with someone that would willingly subject themself to this kind of crap? I should have known though. She is a die-hard fan of reality television and wears shirts that say \\"Team Edward!\\"<br /><br />Just my opinion...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I thoroughly. enjoy this game. it keeps me entertained with my short attention span. vividly colors and many things to do.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|About the only problem I've had is that sometimes it doesn't take my choice. All of my grandkids, from four to eleven enjoy the game.
B0071R43MG|5.0|After the last awful Joe Satriani DVD I was hoping we would get a good Satriani Blu-Ray to watch.  This one looks/sounds great.  The video is well shot, no distracting effects and constant scene changes like the last one Live in Paris.  I do not have a 3D TV, I watched it in 2D Blu-Ray and it was great.  The audio is the star here for me.  The audio choices are as follows:  PCM 24Bit/48KHz Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and Dolby True HD 7.1 24Bit/96KHz Surround.  I listened to the Dolby TrueHD 7.1 on my 5.1 setup with some nice high-end Monitor Audio Gold GX speakers.  Jeff Campitelli's drums in particular are very well recorded with lots of air on the highs and tight low end.  Allen Whitman is new to me and his bass was tight and punchy with a solid performance.  Mike Keneally on keyboards and Galen Henson on guitars sound just right in the mix.  Joe Satriani's guitar is also clean and crisp on those solos.  The surround was good, not overwhelming.  The sound had a solid image in the front with the surrounds adding some more depth to the soundstage and crowd noise.  Not sure how 7.1 would have sounded better over 5.1 but I enjoyed it very much.  The Blu-Ray is recommended for Joe Satriani fans.<br /><br />5/18/2012 - For you Audio Geeks, I found out this isn't a true 24/96K recording, but actually was a 24/48K recording that was upsampled by Dolby.  Here is an article at Stereophile Magazine's website with some technical info, \\"Dolby® Upsamples & Apodizes TrueHD\\".
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I felt like i was playing super mario only with a different character instead of mario!<br />So if you liked playing super mario you will really enjoy this game. very fun app!
B006SV2LWA|4.0|It's understandable that this movie has gotten a lot of bad reviews, as it moves slowly and jumps around alot. I was lucky that I got to watch it the first time without interruptions or distractions. Lose yourself in the story and you've got one of the better surviving collapse of society type movies that has been made in a while. Very realistic.<br /><br />Fans of societal breakdown movies ([[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:0767825225 Savior]]) will find a lot to like in this movie.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Had it on my phone and now on kindle? GREAT! I loved the game and now I can play on my kindle!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|It's about time someone spoofed the cannibal hillbilly cliche. This has to be one of the smartest, funniest horror movies ever made. I still can't believe Hollywood made it. There are so many funny, memorable lines, it is sure to end up a cult classic. Also great to see Alan Tudyk from Firefly.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is such a good book I literly was attched to my kindle until I finshed this book. So like all other Sherlock Holmes books it was awesme!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Am really enjoying this series.  Loved Harry Potter and the Twilight series.  Now am thoroughly enjoying this one too. Can't wait to finish.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Angry Birds.........hm.......it started out well with the original, in fact,very well and then the seasons came out,and then I was a little disappointed.And then they came out with Rio and then I was &quot;ENOUGH ALREADY!&quot;This is getting old and stale.But......they didn't stop,which is good.Say hello to Angry Birds space.i bought this game a week ago and it is clever and sparks the &quot;hm&quot; in me.Rovio thought this one out,and came with some new ideas to the table such as:a gravity free zone,a gravity field, a new bird,and new challenging puzzles.and new bird colors. it follows the same story plot, the pigs want the eggs,and you have to protect them etc.there are many other features to the game that i haven't mentioned.so I encourage you to buy this and enjoy.thanks for reading.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|its a fun game but it never lets me visit my friends village. I keep getting an error starting to restart for update. I do that and nothing changes.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This series was a fun read. It reminded me a lot of a good mix of 1984 and Brave New World, but where the good guys win in the end. That part, good guys winning, is my only complaint. Too easy in the end, too romantic (adventure, not love)but it was a good fast read.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Works great on the kindle fire. I am having  a hard time putting it down. Very addictive. Well worth the money.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is an easy, but fun game.  Safe for even the littlest users.  Good for Dr.'s office (if they have wifi).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed these books. kept me reading on & read all 3 in 2 days time, just to know the outcome! recommend!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Hunger games is a good, quick and easy read.  Great for teens, the plot however is not too complex or sophisticated for adult readers.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This thing is awesome. For the price, I was expecting there to be at least SOME degree of disappointment in either it's functionality, appearance, or installation. But, this product is meeting all of my expectations - even possibly exceeding them a bit. It's a good buy.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|My son loves this movie. Something different. Not the best story line but the humor and action makes up for it.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|This movie was great great great. You are all big film critics now I guess well let me tell you this had twists, turns, suspense it was awesome. Get real people. This movie was absolutely worth the rental.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I've read reviews of the thing falling apart.. dont force your the 'holding arm' up and down. Just slide the phone in and out. I use this for my webseries to record [...] and it works like a charm. You can even replace the small tripod for a full size and still use the mount on it.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Nice movie. I love Dinero and he delievers. Great plot with some nice twists. Bradley Cooper does an excellant job. Glad I rented this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ever since I got the kindle, there hasn't been any games but this game makes me feel like I do have games<br /> I love it
0345803507|4.0|I really enjoyed this series.  Having never read erotic fiction before, it was an interesting introduction.  Every other review which states the writing in this trilogy is a complete abomination are true.  The language is very immature and repetative:  \\"crap\\" \\"double crap\\" \\"mercurial\\" I could go on and on - seriously, this author needs a thesaurus!  However, once past all that I found the characters, storyline, and lets be frank:  the graphic sex, all intriguing.  The series is worth the read if you are able to let go of your literary expectations and look to it for pure, erotic entertainment.  I was able to do that, and as a result found I couldn't put my Kindle down - entire series done in a week!  But if you are looking for quality literary fiction, you would be better off finding something else.
B004X80QNG|1.0|It is pointless to download this application on kindle fire.  It does not sync with Google calendar.  I rate it 5 stars on my phone and a waste of money here.
B007NPLHUW|5.0|I already have a call into the \\"Guinness Book of World Records, as Bo (Anna Silk) has to hold the non cable single season series record in the category for the number of minutes of highlighted cleavage!  Ms. Silk's impressive display of rack-age aside, this is a very, very good show.<br /><br />Wise cracking Kenzie (Ksenia Solo) who is no \\"slouch\\" in her own right, plays Bo's side kick and works the role in a similar manner to Charisma Carpenter in \\"Angel\\".<br /><br />Casting Bo as bi-sexual was a smart scripting move, as it can only broaden her fan base!<br /><br />The supporting cast is very good and the show is consistently bringing in new characters with different powers to keep things interesting.<br /><br />This show has a soon to be concluding 2nd season and has already been green lighted for a 3rd.  I don't that anyone cares all that much that Anna Silk is playing a character much younger.  In reality, she is actually 4-years older than the actress that plays her mother!  Then again, this is a fantasy series and the person(s) in charge of wardrobe know what they are doing.<br /><br />It is interesting to me that this Canadian produced show is only available on Amazon as an Australian import?  Perhaps with The SyFy Network broadcasting Lost Girl, the series will be more readily available.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Say it was a great beginning to an excellent trilogy. The character development was paced just right, including secondary characters. The world that Abercrombie creates is believable and well thought out. I've become somewhat bored with mainstream fastasy series that all seem to contain dragons so reading a fantasy novel which contain \\"real\\" characters (excluding Bayaz) was refreshing.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game gives different appeals and does give a challenge. but if you heat he games before you have enough points to buy more it gets boring.
B00634GHJA|5.0|It was great! I got this app as the free app of the day, because I though it might come in handy. then my kindle fire broke open but it still worked so I used the app to get all my photos on to my second kindle. it worked great!!!

0756665949|4.0|I can't be termed a &#34;Lostie&#34;, as I never watched the show on TV. But when the complete DVD set went on sale, I bought it and this Lost Encyclopedia. Then I shelved the Encyclopedia, to not open it until after I'd finished the series. There is so much switchback, mysterious foretelling and convoluted backtelling that I can now say with confidence that I would have ruined several surprises for myself if I had dipped into the encyclopedia before finishing the series.<br /><br />After watching the series to the end, I've really enjoyed reading the &#34;Lost Encyclopedia&#34;. Great pictures and illustrations. Insights and relevancies I missed while watching the DVDs. Reminders of parts I liked. This is a good hardcover book full of photos.<br /><br />Happy Reader
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! it is awesome on the kindle fire! It is so much better on the big screen (as opposed to my phone). I've been waiting so long! Thank you!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|It's pretty moving.  There were a couple scenes that will stay in my memory for a long time.  I like fast cars and guns and cigars, but this was a real love story, and that's a good thing.  And it carries a pretty stern lesson also: if you have something really special with somebody, don't ever let circumstances scare you and squash it out.  The story, acting, and dialogue were great.
1401937268|5.0|These cards reflect the exact beauty that one would expect from the angelic realm. The artwork is so moving in itself.  Wish that there was more verbal input with each card in the guide book.  Understand made to be short and sweet, but it is more of a mini-guidebook.  Would recommend the deck because Spirit can be felt in simply holding and scanning the deck. Thank you to all who contributed to this wondrous works.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|First off I really liked the book. The story is pretty good and the writer does a good job describing each charcter so we can make a visual in our mind while reading it. That is about where the good writing ends. Like I said, the story is good and the 'erotic' part of the book is great.....until you keep reading and it's the same description of of them having sex all thru the book. I would have liked more of the story expanded instead of reading about her 'inner goddess' on every other page. To me it was an XXX version of Twilight except Stephanie Meyers is a better writer.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun. It has all different types of animals. My daughters favorite thing on this game is the minigame. You get to karate chop piranahs. Some animals you can get or earn are piranahs, mamoths, beavers, sloths, And much, much more.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game. I love these type of games.  very fun and lots of ways to complete goals. looking for something to pass the time? choose this
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Saw RUSH on this Tour two times in Los Angeles ( the Gibson ) and Irvine. What can i say?...This video capture the essence of the show, simply amazing and unforgettable...
B004RJMUJO|4.0|it is a good app but it can get boring after a while so I recommend to get the free app but if you like to blow out your money buy the 10000000000000000.00 one byyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeee you are awesome for reading Hannah Kate's opinion
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was an eye opener as to what went on during World War II and the massacre of the Jewish population. I really enjoyed this story and liked the way it all connected to past and present.  Well worth the read.
1592537251|5.0|This book was simultaneously an adventurous journey and a useful study in urban sketching.  First as an art book, the pictures are large, vibrant, and fill up the pages.  As an instructive book I enjoyed learning about urban sketching as a movement.  I loved the detail in the margins and insets about the tools used and the artists biographies.  Just seeing so many different artistic styles and treatments from artists around the world was instructive and inspiring to me as an artist.  I've enjoyed sketching people around me in public places and now I'm going to get active online.  Great book to just look at, but a priceless one to an artist.  I was really surprised for the quality of the printing and paper that this book was &lt;$20 - feels like a $35 art book.
B005K01VZS|4.0|I found it a little slow moving at the beginning but thoroughly enjoyed the message in this book.  I have read many books by Mitch Albom and find him to be an excellent story teller and a very compassionate and caring person, it comes across in his stories. A good read.
B004EPYZUS|2.0|Hopelessly silly plot, poor special effects. Paula Patton is the only bright spot. Tom Cruise looks ridiculous most of the time. Why is the entire movie less exciting than a single episode of ABC's \\"Missing?\\" Get back to animation, Brad Bird. We need you.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This book felt like an adult trying to be a teenager (gratuitous sarcasm and profanity). Although poignant in parts, especially near the end, it just didn't seem genuine (can't quite find the right word)????? In the end, I just didn't buy it. I never felt connected to the characters.  Yes, I dabbed a tear or two, but if I can't get emotionally invested until the last chapter.....
B004X80QNG|3.0|I love the Windows Mobile version of this app. This app is missing some of the functions of that app, though. For example, I want the goals list that I have in the other version, and I want to be able to create a task or event from contacts, and create an event from tasks. I am anxiously awaiting updates.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Think about the good thoughts peeps! U R little freaks when it comes to reviewing!!!!Stop talking poop about this game.IT'S RIDICULOUSLY STUPID! Peace out little freaks!!!!=p
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the game itself is fun but there is a glitches that adds 100 hours to everything making it impossible to play for days
B0058VW36U|1.0|This app is now at version 1.4. Why isn't on top of updating their apps ? The Google Play market is the best way to go to keep your apps current !
0312576463|5.0|but, then neither is the Iliad. but, then neither is the Iliad. but, then neither is the Iliad. but then neither is the Iliad.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a fun game. It is also a good time passer. I bought the game cause I thought it would help with boredom. I like it very much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All three books leave you wanting more! I am completely in love with Christian and Anastasia and I was hooked from page 1. The sex was hot but the love story reduced this mother of 2 to fits of teenage giggles, tears, laughs, and moments where I neglected everything to read. I'm devastated the books are over and cannot wait to see what E.L. James does next!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my four year old loved it! I loved it too- and it's free! it's not complicated and the quality is excellent!
B007CKNX28|5.0|This is what it must have felt like in the 70's when you heard an album for the first time and knew it was a groundbreaking classic.  This album is phenominal!  I'm a slight fan of the white stripes but this is much much better, I felt like I was hearing led zepplin or jimi Hendrix for the first time.  Just outstanding.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|A great scientific insight into how habits work and how to change them. It really puts into perspective why we do what we do and how to change it. Its not meant as a quick fix self help book which is good because quick fix self help books don't really work.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I fell in love with the sound in this headset, but that's where the love ended. While 16 feet of moving space seems cool, the cord gets tangled easily, and then when you get it too tangled, the wiring fails severely. I've bought and exchanged this headset at least 3 times through a local store (since I hear TB's customer service is terrible) and it ALWAYS happens! I've been burned enough times that I'm going to go for a wireless one instead.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I have a kindle fire and it just sits at getting ready and I never get to play. I tried to uninstall and reinstall and still does not work. very upset at this point
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very engaging and thought-provoking book.  I would say it's not for those who are younger than teens due to the violent imagery.  I read the whole series and enjoyed all three books.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the game is quite fun... the only problem I seem to have as others stated is the visit friends on facebook part...on the kindle fire... other than that it is good
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|It's easy to understand why he sell his tits off. After reading On Writing he is completly likable, and gets to the point.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|So wow, I pretty much knew from all of the other reviews how this book would end and still... wow.  I liked Delirium but Pandemonium was even better.  In fact, amazing.  I was instantly drawn to Julian as was Lena.<br /><br />Lena gets answers on many things, including her mother.  The book goes back and forth from when she was rescued to now.  Each chapter goes back and forth titled Now, and Then...  It is easy to follow and necessary in order to understand who Lena has become now that she is an Invalid.<br /><br />Lena spends a lot of time trying to forget Alex, and Hana.  Julian is an amazing add in character and so are all of the people in the Wilds.  I found this to be my favorite read so far this year.<br /><br />There are twists, shocks, deliria, and more...  Plenty of action.  I am in love with this author, this book way oversteps the last and hopefully the third will be even more amazing if possible.
0307956350|1.0|This book was very slow developing and boring.  The author spent the first half of the book talking about life for rich moms in Luxembourg.  Any suspense the book had took place in the protagonist's earlier life or was based on bogus-feeling suspicions that all happen to be true and confirmed by a very convenient character who does all the leg-work and seems to have all the answers from start to finish.  In short, this book was extremely boring and contrived
B0055PGUYU|5.0|A very intresting book and such.an intresting topic ! I had no clue that Habbits were such a powerful part of our everyday lives. ! Enjoyed reading this book all the way and highly recommend it!
B000HEWEEE|5.0|First I love this movie....shipping was fast and I enjoy using amazon. I often make a wish list....highly recommend to my friends.I look for a good price and delivery..
0375869026|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it. I don't normally read middle grade fiction, even as I begin the process of co-writing a middle grades book with a darling friend of mine (and another book blogger). Maybe it was her insistence that MG had stuff to discover that drew me to try a MG book, or the suggestion of this book from a friend on a website I commonly visit. All I knew going into this was that it made some people cry and that it was about a little boy with a facial deformity. Not my usual reading fare at all, but this book really surprised me.<br /><br />WONDER is about August Pullman, a boy beginning fifth grade and school for the first time. The reason? He was born with a genetic defect that left his face rather unsightly (according to most of the people he has encountered in his life). I did some research and, while never explicitly mentioned, I wonder if he has Treacher-Collins Syndrome or something similar. Google it if you're curious! Anyway, August is starting his first year of school at Beecher Academy, where the kids have never been exposed to someone like him. The story is about his trials and tribulations, along with the experiences of the young people around him, as he makes his way through this brave new world and the life that awaits him.<br /><br />Auggie has never known any different than what he is. He was born with a strange face and grew up with it. People have always treated him like he was a monster, from little children to adults. But he is a strong character, powerful in mind and conviction. Being sent to school is something he is hesitant about, especially for the first few months, but he grows and changes - just as the people around him grow and change.<br /><br />The story is told in a number of points of view - August, his sister Via, schoolmates Jack and Summer, Via's boyfriend Justin, and Miranda, Via's old best friend. From these people, the story of August is painted, from the friendships he has to the experiences of what it takes to know and love him. As the reader, we're exposed to every angle of the story, even though at least one POV wasn't really necessary (Justin). The differentiation between narration also ignored me. All six sounded very similar in tone, although Justin's POV was...weird.<br /><br />What I had a problem with in this story was the fact that the story was neatly tied up in a perfect bow. I won't give things away, but the story became predictable in its message from page one. It's a MG book and of course MG isn't going to go down the dark road taken by adult stories. Oh, wait, does this spoil the story? Well, let me just say it's predictable. End of story.<br /><br />This story did not shy away from the hard-hitting topics otherwise. Readers play witness to bullying, intimidation, fear, childhood drama, and medical conditions that drag the reader into the hard life our protagonist and his family has had. This story is touching, heartbreaking, and uplifting all in one.<br /><br />Oh, and I should mention that I actually cried. But it wasn't because of Auggie himself. I won't spoil the story, but it really struck a chord with me (the event) because the exact same thing happened to me.<br /><br />Even if you are not a fan of middle grade fiction, WONDER is worth a look. I believe most readers will enjoy this story through and through - the characters, the plot, the setting of a fifth grade full of turmoil. This was a great introduction for me into the world of MG fiction, and although I don't think I will become a HUGE reader in the field, I do plan on trying to read more into the lives of tweens entering the world of middle school, which I admit, I personally enjoyed a lot more than high school.<br /><br />VERDICT: Touching and warming, WONDER is a unique take on something many fear to tread on. A must read for newcomers to today's middle grade fiction.ve him. As the reader, we're exposed to every angle of the story, even though at least one POV wasn't really necessary (Justin).

0439023521|4.0|I actually give this book four and a half stars.  The book is very good.  I have my reasons listed below.<br /><br />The reason I don't give it five stars is because I thought there were parts that were, well, a little obvious.  Some of the parts you could really expect.  Another reason I didn't give it five stars was because, I thought the plot could be a little bit thicker.  It was thick, but I thought it could have a little more to it.<br /><br />Those were my negatives.  My positives would be that once you start reading you will not be able to put it down.  That's what I really enjoyed about it.<br /><br />Before I first read it, I didn't want to read.  A lot of people I know kept recommending that I read it.  I kept refusing to read because of what I heard it was about.  So, I finally up and decided that I should read it.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down and ended up enjoying it very much.  I definetly recommend that if your wondering whether or not to read it, then you should.<br /><br />I hope my recommendation is very helpful.
B00102F5WK|5.0|\\"Rendition\\" is a fictional drama film which draws attention to the ability of governments to refer terrorist suspects to offshore interrogation.<br /><br />The narrative is cleverly put together to also include a subplot and as the story unfolds it becomes clear how the two stories link.<br /><br />It is seeing the inhuman treatment of Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), who is detained in an unnamed North African country, and the anxiety that his whereabouts cause his wife Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon) and family, which exposes the lawlessness that can be used against terrorist suspects.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
0439023513|3.0|The book was good, but could have been better.  Some of the parts make sense but others don't.<br /><br />**Some of this may contain spoiler**<br /><br />My negatives about it, like the first one, some parts were obvious.  Like, you kind of expect them to go to war.  You kind of expected that they would save Peeta and that Katniss and Peeta were going to end up together in the end.  You also expected that they would end the games.  Along with various other things that were obvious.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed me was that there was a, I guess you could call it, a \\"love triangle\\".  Why is that so many teen fiction books have to have a love triangle involved?  In all honesty it can get boring and very redundant.  It always seems that you have one character who is mopey because they know that they'll never be with the main character, and yes I'm refering to Gale (I'm not trying to be too biased, or into that whole Team Gale Team Peeta thing, but, it makes more sense that Katniss and Peeta will be together).<br /><br />I also thought the book could be a little bit longer.  Like the other two, it was also 27 chapters (I would have to include the epilogue being that is only a page).  There was some detail, but I thought it could use a little more on the after the war part, because it just seemed rushed.  I would have like to known in the epilogue was, what happened to Gale?  Was he still living in District 2 or did he come back to District 12?  I would've also liked to have known what happened to Haymitch, being that he is my favorite character (I liked him because he did have common sense when he was sober and I also felt bad for him), did he continue to raise geese?  Did he later die?  Does he still sleep with a bottle of white liquor in one hand and a knife in the other?  Would've liked to have known even if he wasn't one of the main characters, but have played major rolls.<br /><br />Other than those flaws, the rest of it was good.  What I did like about it was the element of surprise.  I like how I wasn't expecting some things in the book.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good series and a okay conclusion to it.  I hope my review was helpful!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|\\"I've always seen you, angel.  From the moment you found me, I've seen nothing but you.\\"<br />(Gideon to Eva in \\"Bared to You\\")<br /><br />I liked it!  I really, really liked it!!!  Well done!  The writing resembles a seasoned author's work.  And hurrah - hurrah, there were none of those  repetitive \\"inner goddess\\" phrases appearing on every other page!  And the lead characters presented a much more mature and knowledgeable persona.  Between \\"Fifty Shades\\" and this one, I would choose this one without a doubt.<br /><br />I admit I don't frequently read this type of book.  But as I once again stepped over the boundaries (which equals curiosity got the best of me), I was immediately drawn into this intensely obsessive tale (told from Eva's POV in first person) and totally captured and intrigued from beginning to ending.<br /><br />I won't bother repeating the plot summary since it has been covered very well by other reviewers.  Suffice it to say that this one will add an extra dose of spice to the reading list.  Gideon and  Eva  certainly provide just that and wonderfully so.  Their story is compelling, moving and hypnotic.  Although sad and hurtful in many ways, there is magic in their newly-found relationship.  And certainly enough steamy hot sexual encounters, both in and out of the bedroom, to keep a reader's heart rate in overdrive.  Although both characters are strong-willed and intelligent, as well as beautiful individuals, they  each carry heavy burdens with troubled pasts.  The road to happily-ever-after may be a bit bumpy for these two.<br /><br />This is my first Sylvia Day book but it certainly won't be my last! Wow!  I wasn't quite ready for the \\"short-changed\\" ending that left this reader begging for more.  And October is a long way off before we get another peek at Gideon and Eva, as well as an interesting secondary cast.
0439023491|5.0|This is probably the best book in the entire series!  It takes a little bit to get into it but once you start really getting into it, it gets better.<br /><br />One reason I think this is the best book in the series is because, it gets so interesting!  I like how the plot had so many twists in it!  I love the foreshadowing it does, with that being said it is very crucial to pay attention through out the novel.  Right when you read the last page it just leaves you in shock!  If you enjoyed the first one then you'll enjoy this one, if your like me though, a whole better than the first one.<br /><br />I do recommend this book and the series!  I hope you decide to read it and enjoy it as much as I did!

B0074EIQUG|5.0|Auerbach infuses a nostalgic sound to the Mac's wonderful and poignant vocals. A fascinating mix of modern magician and icon of the bayou. As others have said: buy it, you'll like it.
B00628RVV0|5.0|I can barely bring myself to watch movies like this but was curious about it.  I'm such a softie that they make me cry.  But this is a part of history and it's unfortunate that the Germans of that era weren't all subjected to what this one man was.  The war against the Jews would have stopped overnight.  Actually the German boy gave his life to help his friend not understanding what it was all about. The writer of this movie depicted the horrors in a very factual and realistic way.

0345803485|1.0|The book I received was anything but new. The pages are warped, the binding is not new and there are spots on pages that would not be there if it was a new book. I'll never buy another physical book from Amazon again.
B0071QIN00|2.0|I have really enjoyed the trial xtreme series, but this game just got way too hard too fast. I am straight up STUCK on level 6. I have spent too much time trying to beat it! the physics are cool, as are the extra buttons for hopping and braking, but the levels are ridiculous.
0307352145|5.0|The book provided insights about who I am that I never knew previously.  As an example, I always wondered why I felt the need to retreat into my home or office refuges at times--and now I finally understand.  This book has helped me accept and embrace who I am as an introvert and a quiet person, and not feel like I'm somehow inferior to others.  Nicely written and well-researched, this book can be of tremendous value for anyone who yearns to understand why they're not as gregarious or loud as others around them--and how this is actually a strength and an asset in life.  Highly recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I live in a different state than my grown children. LOVE playing with my grand daughter! All my kids and my husband are hooked! Now if I could only find FAMILY FEUD for the Fire I could get rid of the iphone!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The first book had me hooked immediately, I read it in one day! The first book had me rooting for Katniss and Peetah to make it back to their home and have a happy ending (obviously not so easy with 2 more books). The second book was jaw dropping and had my skin crawling at times. The third book was riveting and had me on the edge of my seat until the very last page!!<br /><br />I was glad that I took the risk when I bought all 3 because in the end I loved the trilogy!!

B005FJ7DOM|4.0|They are called vampires, but in some ways they act more like zombies. This is a post apocalyptic world. This movie reminded me of Zombieland, but without the humor. A man and a teen are traveling in a car. Sometimes the teen narrates. Humans have formed into groups, some religious cults, and some have resorted to cannibalism. They are headed to New Eden, although we don't know exactly why. Along the way they pick up a nun (Kelly McGillis), who was attacked by rapists, who in turn are killed by our heroes, Mister (Nick Damici) and Martin (Connor Paolo). Turns out there is a large group of people known as the Brotherhood who work with the Vampires and used them to bring down civilization, all which is God's plan (no doubt inspired by a certain US political group). Eventually a pregnant Danielle Harris joins the group.<br /><br />Vampire teeth have become the new currency. What we didn't find out what caused the infection or how it was spread. What was interesting is that our heroes head north because the vampires are cold blooded and don't like the cold. The movie plot was good, but the characters were softly written. There was no real effort to give them personalities unlike Zombieland which spoiled us.

B004LROMQG|4.0|Merlin is a great series & a lot of fun to watch. But on my copy Episode 6 has a glitch that freezes the disc. This can be overcome by jumping foreward to the next scene & then backing up very slowly to just after the glitch. You can then view most of the missing scene.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I saw this movie last night, hoping that it would live up to its reviews.  Was I ever wrong.  After about the first three minutes or so I was thinking \\"What the hell is going on\\"?  If you're suffering from insomnia, you're sure to be asleep after 15 minutes, as you'll exhaust yourself trying to figure out what's going on in the first 10.  Do not get this movie unless driving yourself inasne is your goal.
0307454568|4.0|this is a \\"must read\\" book. the first 2 books are quite a build-up for the final book in this series. salander and the rest are very deep characters and would really like to read more about them, albeit impossible with the death of larsson.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Older version, but the DVD is in perfect condition as is the case, which isn't at the top of my priority list. A wonderful movie and the quality of the DVD is just as I hoped.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It has been a really long time since I have read an on going story that has been this great. It is so hard to put down. I would not recommend for elementary age kids but I would for Jr/Sr High. I am very glad that I bought the trilogy so that when I was done with one book I could go right to the next. I have to say I'm not one for sci-fi so to stay. Since it takes place in the future after a major rebellion. It is was very entertaining. It is like reading a roller coaster ride with all the ups and downs. But I would really recommend this set.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I like it but it takes to long to load when starting wave but the best is that you can summon allies

0439023521|4.0|In a distant future, after war has destroyed the world as we know it today, what was formerly known as North America is now Panem. Panem is made up of 12 districts ruled under a totalitarian authority. Katniss Everdeen is our heroine, who lives with her mother and younger sister in the rustic District 12. In this future world, the authority holds what are known as the Hunger Games each year, where two youths from each district are picked at random to compete to the death. Sounds brutal, but this is how the government reminds the population that they still have control.<br /><br />Author Suzanne Collins has created a delightful futuristic world with Panem. We have several diverse districts; some having little to no technology, while others are overwhelmed with sophistication and wacky clothes to match. When Katniss ends up being a player in the games, her journey in preparation for the games is one full of colorful characters, bizarre foods, and lots of unique sight seeing. While some areas described give us the notion that the future world is a desolate and miserable wasteland, those Katniss visits throughout the games show us that we've also made quite a few interesting advancements to say the least.<br /><br />The book really kicks into high gear when the games begin. There is not a dull or boring moment once things get going. At the beginning of the book I found myself not liking Katniss; I felt she was, well, a bit of a bitch for lack of a better term. But as the games progress, they cause a bit of self-discovery for her and as the reader we really begin to cheer for her. The other characters we meet are also likable and the enemies in the games are as gruesome as you can imagine.<br /><br />Collins' writing style is just the way I like it: short and to the point while also adding that level of sophistication that tells you you're not reading a kid's book, but also doesn't show off like a thesaurus was constantly on stand-by. The detail given allows us to visualize first hand the manufactured and controlled battlegrounds during the games and gives us perfect images of devices and objects that have not yet come to existence.<br /><br />The book is geared towards younger readers, but older readers should not let this deter them from picking it up. In fact, it's tough to tell what age is actually appropriate for this book. With the entire concept of the book being based around violence, it's definitely a young adult read, but the themes are socially relevant and would appeal to many adults as well. If you're looking for something with high action, political turmoil, a touch of sci-fi, and even a slight romance angle, The Hunger Games will not disappoint.<br /><br />The book is the first of a trilogy which is also currently being developed as a film series at the time of this review. It will certainly be interesting to see how the films play out, as with the many non-existent items and all. The second and third books have since been released, Catching Fire and Mockingjay, which have been getting good reviews as well. With the gaining popularity and upcoming films, it will not surprise me that more will be heard about the series, and Collins will be much deserving of her accolades for crafting such an exciting modern adventure.<br /><br />Source: criticnic.com 25-November-2010

B004AUGJS8|4.0|Ryan Gosling has been a household name this past year. This is for good reason: the man has good range. Whether it's playing a ladies man with his Photoshopped abs or a  wheel-man out for blood, he can get us believing in his characters. Last year's All Good Things is another surprising role for Gosling. He plays David Marks (based around the real life Robert Durst), a young man from a wealthy New York real estate family.<br /><br />The story starts off simple and fairly slow. Marks meets Katie (Kirsten Dunst) and they fall in love. They move to Vermont to run a health food store called All Good Things, however they soon return to New York after David's father's urges for him to be a part of the family business. It's at this point things start getting interesting. Once David and Katie get married, things really start getting strange.<br /><br />David soon shows signs of some kind of mental disturbance. From talking to himself, to distancing himself from Katie, it's clear that something isn't right. Gosling handles the many different sides of David with eerie accuracy. The bouts between David and Katie are emotional and intense, which really start to set the tone for the rest of the film.<br /><br />The chemistry with Dunst and Gosling is great (well, despite the dark circumstances that take place). I can't say Kirsten Dunst has done a lot to get my attention since The Virgin Suicides, but in this film she did an excellent job and really had me feeling for Katie. Similar to my response to Gosling and Michelle Williams in Blue Valentine, Ryan and Kirsten really have me believing they are a couple with serious marital problems.<br /><br />This is far from just a relationship gone wrong drama, however. We see glimpses of shady real estate escapades in the background as well as a status-loving family and the pressure that can have. The second half of the film also turns into a dark crime mystery with multiple murders and curious hints placed throughout different scenes. All of these events comprise a bizarre character study that is even more fascinating when considering the facts of which it is based.<br /><br />I found it surprising I haven't heard more about this film, especially considering how \\"in\\" Gosling is these days. The film is solid with great directing and cinematography, and a top notch cast. Perhaps a lot of people don't enjoy a slower burning drama that builds up character development and story and would rather have the good stuff dished out to them right away. Or maybe I'm just partial to a good dark crime thriller based on real people and events. Whatever the case may be, All Good Things was a great surprise.<br />Source: criticnic.com 25-January-2012All of these events comprise a bizarre character study that is even more fascinating when considering the facts of which it is based.<br /><br />I found it surprising I haven't heard more about this film, especially considering how \\"in\\" Gosling is these days.

B006OB3K56|4.0|Back when I watched Hunger, I recall being extremely moved by both the subject matter and the tragically beautiful imagery from director Steve McQueen. For his second feature, McQueen again tackles a controversial subject and relies on the use images and feelings to capture it.<br /><br />McQueen wisely uses his star from Hunger in Shame. Michael Fassbender plays Brandon, a successful and attractive New Yorker struggling with sex addiction. What I loved about Fassbender in Hunger was that he really was able to evoke so much feeling without having to speak, something not many actors can do well. In Shame he is able to achieve the same effect, with each look conveying a multitude of emotions.<br /><br />The character of Brandon lives a fairly routine life. Apart from his seemingly successful career and a normal social life involving having drinks at upscale cocktail bars, we're shown a more up-close look at his life of a sex addict, a darker side that he shields off from the outside world. He masturbates frequently, constantly looks at pornography, and has sex with girls from the bar to call-girls. While parts of that may sound like the life of an oversexed college student, here it's anything but funny or glorified.<br /><br />Brandon's routine is disrupted when he's paid an unexpected (and unwanted) visit from his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). From the moment Brandon plays and ignores messages on his answering machine from Sissy to her arrival in his apartment, we wonder why he's so heartless towards his sister. As the film progresses, there are hints that they have experienced painful childhoods, though nothing more is ever revealed.<br /><br />The dysfunctional relationship of Sissy and Brandon is a puzzling one, which leaves us wanting to know more. Every interaction they have, whether it be a look across a room or an uncomfortable heated exchange with a naked Brandon on top of Sissy, we can tell there's a lot to know. The two actors do a great job of keeping thedrama believable and McQueen does an equally great job of not spelling things out for us while keeping things interesting.<br /><br />Brandon also meets a woman named Marianne (Nicole Beharie) who causes an additional a stir in Brandon's life. She seems different than his usual encounters. Is he capable of a real relationship? This is one of many questions I asked myself. Between Sissy and Marianne, Brandon finds himself facing some personal dilemmas that we gather he's not at all used to. The ensuing drama had me feeling all sorts of emotions, but by the end I did begin to feel a little bit of hope.<br /><br />Most people will be talking about this film for its graphic sex scenes, but the film really is first and foremost a psychological drama. Brandon is a very enigmatic and fascinating character whose every action has our attention. Initially, he kind of seems like a mere pervert, but as the film progresses I really started to realize and try to understand his disease. Sex addiction is often joked about, but if there are people like Brandon out there, I think it's something that deserves to be taken seriously.<br /><br />In addition to being psychologically stimulating material, Shame is also superbly crafted in such a way that each scene captures the essence of the characters and their moods. Much like Hunger, Shame doesn't just look pretty, but the gorgeous shots also say something about each scene. From a simple back-and-forth scene with Brandon and Sissy while Sissy sings in a restaurant, to a tracking shot with Brandon running, I felt closer to the characters without them having to even do much of anything.<br /><br />Shame does for erotica what Drive did for car movies. While Shame has some otherwise steamy sex scenes, in context they're rather not sexy at all. The film is about more than the sex, Shame is a character study about a man and his internal struggles. To simply write this film off as an erotic escapade would be unfortunate. While the film is often difficult to watch and leaves us with more questions than answers, it's a fascinating drama with a lot to appreciate.<br />Source: criticnic.com 21-April-2012<br />Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox

B007FH9GT2|5.0|If one would recall back to my review of the 2009 Swedish film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I expressed my worry of the upcoming American rendition of the film. My worry was for good reason. The Swedish film had a profound effect on me, and its star Noomi Rapace left an everlasting impression. How was I to handle the idea of a new cast and possible new take on the story?<br /><br />I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. What first stood out was that there were quite a few differences in this rendition. One of my worries was that it would be a shot-for-shot remake of the Swedish film, sort of like Let Me In (also based on a Swedish novel and film, Let the Right One In). This was not the case, and made me very excited once I started noticing this.<br /><br />The second thing that took me by surprise was the Rooney Mara was quite impressive as Lisbeth Salander, the complex techie misfit. While Noomi Rapace and her portrayal of Lisbeth will always have a special place with me, Mara's take on the challenging role earned huge points in my book. Even the Swedish accent she had to take on for this film was consistent and sounded convincing.<br /><br />When I saw the Swedish film, I was enthralled in the story and its heroine. I just had to have more of it, so part of me was looking forward to a new rendition just to be able to relive the story once again. The differences with the story gave me many reasons to enjoy this film and still feel the spirit and mystery with the tale.<br /><br />In regards to the story itself, it follows Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a journalist set out to expose the corrupted, who is sentenced for libel. He's propositioned by an elder of a rich family to solve the mystery of a missing niece. Blomkvist gets deep into the family's dark secrets. Meanwhile Lisbeth Salander, a leather-clad computer geek turned  badass, is through unusual circumstances brought together with Blomkvist and the two form an unlikely team.<br /><br />It's a storyof men who hate women (which happens to be the Swedish title of the book and film), and two unique individuals with very different personalities who are also alike in so many ways. It is a dark and mysterious adventure that has the viewer feeling intrigued, excited, scared, and disgusted. On that note, one of my only complaints about the film was there may be a few exploitative and unnecessarily graphic scenes which do indeed get very emotional responses from the audience. While they may be accurate to the source material, seeing it is different than imagining it...but I'll refrain from ranting.<br /><br />I thought by seeing the film once, it was over, but David Fincher's vision managed to give me a fresh new look at the same characters and story from a few different angles. The film is cool and stylish, and carries over the dark and bleakness of the snowy Swedish countryside that was so effective in the Swedish film. Now if they do what they did with this film on the two sequels, than I think we're in for yet another fun retelling of the story that has been taking over the world by storm.<br />Source: criticnic.com 15-January-2012

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|These days it's safe to assume just about everyone has had an online correspondence of some sort. Yaniv Schulman makes no exception to this assumption when he begins a distant online friendship with an 8 year old artist named Abby and her mother. Like many online scenarios, we have to ask ourselves are things really as they seem?<br /><br />As Rel gets more involved with Abby and her mother, Angela, he is soon enough swooned by Abby's sister Meagan. An online romance begins to unfold which inevitably leads to Nev, Rel, and Henry taking their documentary on the road and meet with the elusive family.<br /><br />Catfish has brought on much controversy. Is the documentary real, is it staged, or is it equal parts of both? While the filmmakers stand by the film's authenticity, honestly the answers to these questions are insignificant. The film is an experience to say the least.<br /><br />Catfish is highly entertaining, intriguing, socially relevant, and packed with some great life lessons. Telling you why the film is called Catfish would spoil it, but the title is as fitting is as this film is to our technology age.<br />Source: criticnic.com 10-February-2012

I fell in love with these characters, cried with them, laughed with them, and was just blown away at how this author took me through just about every emotion I know of.<br /><br />Now it's time to start reading Book 2 in the series!  :)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm usually not a fan of this genre (post-apocalyptic and dystopian), but I was really impressed. This is a very good series consisting of five novels, each individual piece more like a novella. Initially it is slightly confusing to get to hang of what is happening, but it all pans out very nicely. I hear that the prequel has recently come out, but I'm yet to read that. Given that I liked this series, I would perhaps read the recently published prequel as well. Overall, a great attempt at self-publishing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a good end to a wonderful series. I am glad I agreed to read the books, it was engrossing and entertaining.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|maybe it seems a little formulaic after DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, but judged on its own merits, it's still a decent story

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this video over and over.  Beginning shows the prep for the show and discusses their coming back together. Most of the songs are Henley and Fry (they did most of their singing anyway).  Walsh does 3 I think.  My favorite is Don Felder who is the odd man out.  Read his book: Heaven and Hell, My Life in the Eagles (1974-2001).  Tells it all.  Felder was the best musician in the band and a MASTER at the accustic guitar. No one has been able to replace the sound he gave to the group.  They are now the \\"Eagles Light\\".  But, the music is great and will survive.  I only wished they were all still together.  Like Don Henley said one time:  I can sing solo performances but I can't duplicate the sound that the group has together.  Enough said.  Eagles Fan
B006DQ1J0K|5.0|Bergonzi is stylish, Price is wonderful,  Tozzi is great (contrary to review in Opera News), but the gem of this live recording is CORNELL MACNEIL.  His singing is of dimensions beyond words.  Solid low notes smooth legato in all registers, and high notes of both beauty and power.  There has never been a better example of this great baritone's work.  Thankfully,  these live recordings are becoming available.  If you hear this one, you then must get the TOSCA with Corelli and Price. Both Verdi and Puccini would have been stunned by this artist's incredible vocalism.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I will admit that I was obsessed with this game for about a week. There were lots of things to do and strategy on how to use resources. The energy runs out really quickly which was annoying, but that just kept me from playing constantly. By the time I passed level 20 I noticed more and more glitches. During the game the screen would freeze more and more often, a problem I'd rarely ever had happen in the months previous on my kindle fire. It doesn't do that with other games which makes me worry that it's messing up my Kindle. There were tons of times when it wouldn't let me click on different items in the game. I tried planting in the same plot of land for almost five minutes, but it wouldn't let me select it. There was also a point where I was trying to buy a building and it wouldn't let me actually select any of them. Despite all this I made it to level 32. Last night I started a few projects in the workshop and planted a few crops. Now it says that they're \\"Ready\\" but it won't collect the item. Since half of it doesn't even work anymore I guess I just won't be playing anymore. It was fun while it lasted, but I'm glad I didn't pay for the game when it only lasted a week.

0307346617|4.0|Like many other readers, I was first introduced to Max Brooks zombie world when I read THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE: RECORDED ATTACKS which first appeared as a section of the ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE and was then later turned into a graphic novel on its own.  I was impressed by the idea and faux history behind the stories.  Therefore, I was looking forward to reading WORLD WAR Z.<br /><br />WORLD WAR Z is a fictional oral history. It consists of a series of \\"interviews\\" with survivors of World War Z; the world's war against zombies. Through a wide variety of interviews from all around the world, the book examines how the outbreak began (no one knows for sure, but it started in Asia, particularly in China), how countries first dealt with the outbreak, what was done to contain the outbreak, the first terrible defeats of humanity, how people survived during the early years of the world, and eventually how humanity fought back and stopped the zombie threat.<br /><br />Brooks attempts to tie the events of the fictional zombie war with actual historical events and news headlines. For instance, there's reference to Iran obtaining a nuclear bomb and what they ultimately ended up doing with it. However, at the same time, the author politicizes some of those events. For instance, it's suggested that morale with U.S. troops was rather low because of an unpopular war in the Persian Gulf. WORLD WAR Z was published in 2006, so with that time frame in mind and other clues dropped throughout the book, it seems clear that the author is referring to the U.S. led war in Iraq.<br /><br />The concept of an oral history for a fictional event is an interesting one. It's been done before and will be done again. However, Brooks seems to have written the fictional oral history of the era.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book. I like reading oral histories of real-world events and I've toyed with the idea of an oral history for a couple of books I've worked on in the past.<br /><br />With that said, an oral history is not the type of book that appeals to a large audience, even if it is about a worldwide war against zombies. Oral histories are told from several different people who have different perspectives of an event. Therefore, there is no overarching narrative; there is no overall story. In real life, oral histories are wonderful devices because they provide one with a greater historical perspective. In a work of fiction, the idea doesn't translate as well. For one, many people read fiction as a form of escapism; they just want to read a good story. There is no one story in WORLD WAR Z.<br /><br />Another problem WORLD WAR Z is that there are no central characters. There's humanity and then there's zombies. However, there are no real heroes and no real villains. This is because the oral history device doesn't allow for any characterization. The best zombie stories, as Robert Kirkman has shown in \\"The Walking Dead\\" revolve around characterization and the relationships between the characters. WORLD WAR Z doesn't feature any of that. By the time the reader gets familiar with one person, the interview ends and the author has moved on to someone else, in a different part of the world.<br /><br />The oral history device also becomes an issue for those who are unfamiliar with it or who don't like it. Personally, I enjoyed WORLD WAR Z. However, there are people I know who have read the book and hated it because they don't like works of non-fiction. I also know people who have read it and said it was just ok because they didn't like the way the book was written.<br /><br />I enjoyed WORLD WAR Z. I'll admit that I was a little disappointed when I started reading it to discover that it wasn't a typical piece of fiction. However, I was already familiar with oral histories, so it didn't take me long to appreciate what the author had done. It's not the greatest piece of zombie fiction I've ever read or seen, but it's not bad.d, an oral history is not the type of book that appeals to a large audience, even if it is about a worldwide war against zombies. Oral histories are told from several different people who have different perspectives of an event. Therefore, there is no overarching narrative; there is no overall story. In real life, oral histories are wonderful devices because they provide one with a greater historical perspective. In a work of fiction, the idea doesn't translate as well. For one, many people read fiction as a form of escapism; they just want to read a good story. There is no one story in WORLD WAR Z.<br /><br />Another problem WORLD WAR Z is that there are no central characters. There's humanity and then there's zombies. However, there are no real heroes and no real villains. This is because the oral history device doesn't allow for any characterization.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you can stomach a lot of raunchy sex and the F word (which don't bother me), then these are some very entertaining books. It was so interesting to see both Christian & Ana change over the course of a few short months. I think I even read them faster than the Twilight trilogy & I will likely read them again.
B007WZ7ILK|5.0|This song is a tribute to the Beach Boys' love for Four Freshmen-like vocals. Sure it's commercial and marketing friendly but the vocals are incredible.
0812992792|1.0|\\"The Orphan Master's Son Has No Clothes\\" -- I'd love to take credit for coming up with that beautifully stated, extremely accurate summing up of this awful, awful book, but I can't. I suppose, if nothing else, I can boast having married the man who did. I wasn't 30 pages into this farce (and I'm not speaking of the story stylings) when it became quite clear that all the praise being heaped upon this pile of literary poo (I am forever mindful that kids may be reading these reviews) was the work of a Marketing Machine.  All it takes is a few \\"rave reviews\\" from \\"objective\\", \\"critically acclaimed critics\\", and everyone is spewing the talking points that will make this waste of paper \\"one of the best books of 2012\\". And we know it's true because David Mitchell (Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell's son) called it an \\"addictive novel\\", and \\"an impressive book\\". There is no way he read the same book I just finished. Nearly 450 pages of incomprehensible, convoluted, drivel. Several of these \\"glowing\\" reviews talk about the book being good because \\"I knew so little about North Korea\\".  Good for you for admitting that!  An admission the author should likewise have made.  There is no more insight into North Korea after you read this garbage than there is before you start. It's not even good fiction. Convoluted is not the same as clever. I could call this meandering, blathering gibberish \\"impressive\\", but I wouldn't be using that adjective to connote any positive admiration. I understand what the publishers did -- you option on a book that is heavy only in the weight of its pages, and you've got to try to sell it as spectacular because you can't very well admit to having knowingly bought something this horrific... I get it. I'm not mad. But, let's be serious. This was a really, really bad book. I can honestly say that I won't soon forget having wasted two weeks trying to gag my way through this unnecessarily pointless novel. And, now I suppose I can be quoted as having called \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" 'unforgettable'...?
B006R1T40I|4.0|I was hoping for a little more original material from Bonnie.  She has a lot of talent and can get my imagination flowing.  The cover songs are good and I love her voice, I was looking forward to hearing new original material, so I am a little disappointed.  Overall, though, I like the album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Out all all 3 book this is by far my favorite. It was nice to see the growth in the relationship and love between Ana and Christian. It was also nice to see some emotion berween them that did not involve the bedroom :)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I don't know whether you should call them \\"IT\\" or \\"They\\". They( it) are so MARVELous!!! I thought when you put all the superheroes together, they would steal the main show from each other. Boy.... I was wrong! They actually form ONE BIG SUPERHERO as a TEAM especially towards the end of the movie \\" The Avengers\\". My heart was pounding at the end of how they managed to pull their remaining resources together to fight Loki, the \\"vengeful\\" & slicky half-brother of Thor.<br /><br />So if you plan to watch this film, you'd better make sure you have watched \\"Thor\\" before this. It is really remarkable how Marvel Studio have creatively linked all the main characters together and you can actually relate them back to their individual movie.<br /><br />The most entertaining movie after \\" Battleship\\"...10x better! Can't wait for the next one!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|MUST READ!!! Everyone has their own opinion and yes some of the scenes are a litte \\"WOW\\", but if you enjoy a GREAT romance story this book is a MUST!!!
0345803485|1.0|This book is inane, boring, ridiculous and as badly written as essay by the dumbest person you know. The characters are NOT interesting. The plot is so thin its transparent.  And sadly, it's a bestseller. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DUMBING DOWN OF YOURSELF.

B00003CXXS|4.0|Steven Spielberg does himself a favor by relinquishing the director duties after the letdown of \\"The Lost World\\" sequel.  Fort Worth native Joe Johnston (\\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\") takes over and brings back a bit of the wonder of the original.  Even Alexander Payne who directed acclaimed films like \\"The Descendants\\" and \\"Sideways\\" gets involved as a co-writer.<br /><br />In this episode we find a separated couple (Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) hiring Alan Grant (returning Sam Neill) to take them to Site B on an island near Costa Rica.  This of course was the hatching ground for the various prehistoric animals that was abandon years earlier.  Their hidden agenda is actually a rescue mission to retrieve their teenage son (always must have a teen) played by Trevor Morgan.  Eric (Morgan) doesn't do high flying gymnastics like Kelly did in the previous sequel but it's pretty clear he is a self sufficient adventurer.  He and his mom's boyfriend manage to parachute onto the dino infested island without an easy path to escape.<br /><br />The filmmakers do a few things right in this iteration.  With the various plot points pretty much used up they keep the length at a tidy 92 minutes.  Instead of the usual alpha-dino T-Rex as the ultimate eating machine, we get an even bigger and meaner Spinosaurus that eats planes as well as humans.  Even better, when a T-Rex does stumble upon the scene, the Spinosaurus shows him who the real king is. Best of all is that the cast is kept small, leaving out the multitudes of testosterone ladled mercenaries we got in part II.  Well that is, until the final ridiculous scene.  At least we don't get transported to the U. S. with another King Kong-like exhibit. As usual the real stars here are the dinosaurs; especially the Velociraptors who we now know are intelligent hunters with communication skills.  Part III isn't nearly as good as the original \\"Jurassic Park,\\" but it does improve on the second and it has the best looking dinosaurs around.<br /><br />If you are a real fan of this franchise, the Blu ray version is a nice step up.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|My family and I started watching the episodes on Netflix but couldn't wait for Season Two to come out on Netflix to find out what lay in store for our favorite characters.<br />Season Two was even better than the first season!<br />This package included the Christmas Episode as well as the full second season of Downton Abbey.<br />Audio and video were perfect.<br />We've had no trouble at all with this product.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|This package, as far as I know as of this writing, is the only way you can get any of the 3 films in Blu ray.  So if you hated the sequels, you can't get the original JP on its own in Blu ray.  That being said the video quality of the three films is universally good.  Speaking of universal, these are releases from Universal Studios who some aficionados insist have the worst transfers.  I found no problem, but minor hiccups don't usually bother me.  The picture in each case is 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, so yes that will fill up your wide-screen TV with beautiful, clear high definition.  Perhaps the biggest improvement is the audio track.  Each film has a DTS-HD MA lossless 7.1 surround sound...and it sounds great.  If you want the full effect of a hissed off T-Rex bellows or his thunder steps this is your baby.  Small sounds are equally cool.  Check out the 'raptor's claws on the stainless steel cabinets in the first film.<br /><br />While the technical aspects of the discs are universally excellent, the three films vary in quality.  Here are my reviews of the films:<br /><br />This review is from: JURASSIC PARK (5.0 Stars)<br /><br />For a thrilling action adventure movie for all ages you can't get much better than this original Steven Spielberg classic. For one of the first times, dinosaurs look real. Mixing animatronics and CGI every carnivore is menacing as hell. The opening sequence will definitely get your attention and once everyone reaches the island, the suspense is sustained.<br /><br />Adapted from Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, multi-millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park on an island near Costa Rica unlike any other. He and his scientists have found a way to clone extinct plants and animal DNA using blood from mosquitoes captured in amber millions of years ago. He brings dino-diggers Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island to help him convince his investors represented by attorney Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) that the idea is solid and that is successfully nearing completion.<br /><br />Several monkey-wrenches are thrown into the mix to put everyone at risk from the meat eaters. To complicate matters further Hammond's 2 spunky grandchildren are along for the ride adding a different element of risk.<br /><br />This review is from: THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (3.0 Stars)<br /><br />If this film was original, perhaps it would have been perceived to be better than it is. Unfortunately it will always be compared to the original \\"Jurassic Park\\" from 3 years earlier. This film, also adapted from a Michael Crichton novel, doesn't pass the test but for one exception. The Stan Winston dinosaurs are more plentiful and even more convincing.<br /><br />In this story we find out that while the original Jurassic Park and its animals were destroyed, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) had another nearby island where the actual cloning took place before the animals were removed to the park. His company is now in bankruptcy and is run by his no-good nephew (Arliss Howard) who wants to capture and move the animals to San Diego. So Hammond recruits Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) again to lead a crew who would photograph and document the animals before the evil nephew gets there. Malcolm (a survivor from the first film) refuses to go until he is told his girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) is already on the island. So off he goes with 2 other crew members, Nick (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie (Richard Schiff).<br /><br />While the original kids, Lex and Tim, show up for a cameo appearance early in the film, they don't make the trip. So the kid factor comes in the way of Malcolm's stowaway teenage daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester). The fact that she's black and Malcolm isn't doesn't come up until Vaughn's character says to another, \\"does anyone see a family resemblance?\\" So I guess that's addressed.<br /><br />There aresome exciting scenes in this sequel. One involves Sarah and Nick deciding to treat a baby T-Rex who has a broken leg. They take it back to the trailer at the base camp. Gee, neither of these scientists thought that perhaps the infants cries might attract mom and/or dad. After ignoring the phone in the trailer that would have warned them of their obvious peril, dino-dad and mom let the scientists know what they thought of the idea of doctoring their kid.<br /><br />Except for a few humorous quips from Goldblum's character, the film is hampered by ridiculous dialog and even more ridiculous circumstances. Some of these are the equivalent of the teenagers in a horror movie who don't leave the haunted house when they have a chance. There is enough here however to recommend the film, albeit without much enthusiasm.<br /><br />This review is from: JURASSIC PARK III (3.5 Stars)<br /><br />Steven Spielberg does himself a favor by relinquishing the director duties after the letdown of \\"The Lost World\\" sequel.

B002R88G5E|4.0|It is a touched story! My friend told me she was cried when she read it, so I bought it. I didn't cry, but I have admitted it touched some bottom of my heart. Anyway it is also a book which makes you to think.
B005QMOZOO|5.0|Thought it was a great read and loved they way the characters were portrayed.Have recommended it to several friends who read it and have enjoyed it also.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I got my brother, who lives in the UK, hooked on Dexter with season 1. Gift giving has never been easier at Christmas time. If you have never seen Dexter, I recommend that you watch the first episode of season one. When you do, you will be addicted to a serial killer with morals. My husband was not initially \\"interested\\" in such a thing. However he now, wants to see what the writers can come up with next...they continue to wow us.<br />Poor Dexter, its getting harder and harder for him to play his part, the rules keep changing...

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is a great app I love it so much you should really. get it best game ever love chloe
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was a little over-rated.  It was a very easy read more for teenagers than adults... As I assume it was written for.  If you just want a read without having to really think, you will enjoy this book.  Having said that I am going forward and reading the next book...
B004EPYZUI|5.0|i never watch this movie while its in the cinema, until i got the blu ray. Lots of people has already given the review, so i just gotta cut to the chase<br />Hmmm... how do i start, you either love it or hate it!!!! The plot is very interesting and entertaining if you watch it from the psychological, deeper point of view. Its not a movie that we can watch and forget easily, its a movie that have lots of discussion and argument after watching it. well!!! i think its good to have lots subjective view huh..... Anyway, i love the artwork in the movie, the fighting scene is epic (fight with the zombie, the orc, dragon, robots...).<br />What truly surprise me is that, oh man!! look at how those girls handle the weapons, is damn professional!!! the CG are awesome, the colors essence that delivers in the movie really has the comic kind of feeling for me. And of course, the zack snyder's slow motion effect in the movie are superb too, which i am sure you are very familiar with.<br /><br />Well! I personally think its worth the purchase, besides theres lot of extra feature in this blu ray too. Happy watching!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000W7JWUA The Settlers of Catan]] is a game that is much fun, allows for a lot of friendly talk and at the same time taxes the brain in good ways. If mental activity is good for the elderly to help ward off dementia (I am 85 years old) then Settlers of Catan is good medicine. On top of that the company that produces the game in the U.S., Mayfair Games, reliably offers outstandingly good service. My game arrived with pieces that were slightly warped. It didn't keep us from playing but it was an annoying distraction. I contacted Mayfair Games by email and was quickly answered by Kim of Mayfair Customer Service. After she was certain of the reality of the problem she quickly sent me replacement game pieces which fit perfectly with no annoying distraction. Product is always important, of course, but good customer service is the one thing that makes any company stand out above the competition.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Finally someone gets it right. This is a nice app if your a person like myself who is very busy.  Sometimes a little too busy to bother with little things like due dates that appear once a month on a piece of paper, that is often mixed with junk mail. This app allows you to put in your bills, color code them and enter amt due and date due. If you have it on your fire it will inform you of an upcoming bill due within one week of the due date. It will also allow you to enter your paycheck as reoccuring income.<br />While all that is great, the thing that made me give it five stars are the app permissions. They are not excessive and they actually make sense.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I've only listened to this once in its entirety (so far). But, I really like what I've heard. For those bemoaning the fact that there isn't enough guitar...ignore them. Not every White Stripes song was a \\"rocker\\" or \\"power ballad\\". This album is sophisticated, and there are elements of many genres. Don't hesitate. No clunkers or second-rate tunes. Great stuff!
0071752854|5.0|The book \\"Pitch Anything\\" is an absolute must read for anyone who wants to get their way in life. Yes, it's business focused and an amazing read but the truth is that the lessons contained in the book can be used in any situation. Oren's \\"Frame control\\" offers the perfect set up to both understanding \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" to get what you want in business or in your personal life. It's really the best business book I've read in a long time. 5 Stars!
030746363X|4.0|The 4-Hour Body by Timothy Ferris is an interesting read.  The concepts of minimum effective dose and the 80/20 rule are great, and can be used almost anywhere.  For example you wear 20% of your cloths 80% of the time and you wear the remaining 80% of cloths only 20% of the time.  Me, being a guy 90/10 is probably closer.  The diet is a new twist on the low-carb diet called slow carb allowing legumes and many vegetables.  The diet is pretty easy to follow if you like legumes.  I worry that a lot of doctors think Tim Ferris's 4-hour body is a hoax, but believe me doctors know very little about nutrition and exercise.  I've met few doctors as fit as Timothy Ferris or me for that matter.  Enough BS! Good read, I recommend it.
B00005R23S|1.0|At the beginning of this concert dvd, we were all hepped up to get down with some good music. It is good music, however Bruce's ongoing rants soon became tiresome. He would continually come back to rambling on ,in the style of a baptist preacher. It was very strange. We soon tired of this, and really aren't interested in watching this dvd again. That in itself is saying alot,since we normally watch concert dvds over and over again. So very sorry we ordered this particular concert. I know there is a better one out there, that is fun to watch. That's the idea, isn't it?
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|The title says more than enough, but I'll explain.<br /><br />I'm not a baseball fan. It's not that I hate baseball. I don't. I'm just not a fan of the sport. Because I'm not a fan of baseball this movie was so boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring!<br /><br />The plot left a lot to be desired. I laughed ONCE during the entire film! Once! There was no suspense, no action, no comedy nothing! If you are not a baseball fan, I repeat, don't watch Moneyball!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a very interesting and fast reading book.  Hard to put down!  Would love to see the movie now!
B001RJTFP4|5.0|This movie is a classic! Leave behind everything you think you know about the world when you watch Blade because he this movie is different from anything you've ever seen! So many action movies can't level up to Blade because the actors in this movie gave 100% from start to finish, especially each and every villain and vampire! And don't even get me started with the amazingly crafted fight scenes!!!!
B004UXUX7S|5.0|Can't understand wht it didn't win an Academy award.  It had lows and highs.  Great movie.  Watched it with my daughter and we both thought it was great
B003V5HWWA|5.0|Once upon a time Disney movies were enjoyable for children and adults alike! They were full of laughter and adventure and even a bit of suspense (which could prove scary for the little ones). Best of all, hidden in each film were morals of pursing dreams, telling the truth, standing up for beliefs and freedom!<br />Aladdin was one of the last classic Disney films produced before the new millennium brought forth a different wave of animated films. Every child today should have the opportunity to watch Aladdin! Maybe they'll enjoy it as much as I did when I was their age!
B00486070K|5.0|Got this for use with my macbook air (which doesn't have a built in ethernet port). It works as perfectly as a built in ethernet port (except for the fact that you've now tied up a USB port on your system with this). The only thing to be careful of (as is with all Apple products) is the cabling. Be careful not to bend it to absolute extremes on the joints as the cables do tend to rip and shred. This has been a common complaint with Apple products, especially with any iPod adapters. It's apparent that the same methodology to creating those cables has been applied here. I can already see the signs of wear on the ends of the cable (although I admit, it does get a fair amount of abuse just sitting in the bottom of my bag). That being said, I don't know why the entire cable portion is necessary. Still, it works like a charm with no issues whatsoever.
B0071MV540|4.0|After all the Shrek movies, Norbit and Imagine That I seriously thought that Eddie Murphy would never again be that cool guy I remembered from the Beverly Hills Cop series. This film shows that we might have our old friend back! Eddie Murphy was funny, witty and deceivingly clever in this movie. There was even a hint of suspense as well!<br />If you're an Eddie Murphy fan, you'll enjoy Tower Heist!

B000ICZD4I|5.0|This movie is a tear jerker. The whole cast of characters are spectacular. I watch it every chance I get. :)
B004X75RK4|5.0|Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds really owned their roles in this film! Unlike other films that tell a similar story, this movie made sure to give time for character development!!!!<br />There are fun scenes, romantic scenes, dramatic scenes and even extremely quirky ones! In other words, there's something for everyone! Enjoy the film!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works perfect for me, slightly unpredictable over a non home network but still works.  The only thing that I would add can beer said for all if these types if apps, there needs to be an ability to download straight from the steamer to the app.
B003ZHR6T8|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Douglas has ultimate road rage and shows just what a complete mental breakdown looks like. Love when he machine guns the phone booth. That would never happen nowadays, since there are no more phone booths. Machine gunning a cell phone on the ground just wouldn't be the same. Great price, worth watching if you have never seen it.
B001MW0J2O|2.0|My attention was drawn to Animal Collective by the use of their track \\"Summertime Clothes\\" in [[ASIN:B002ASVQYO a mix]] by DJ James Lavelle, where it worked quite well. I subsequently saw the absolutely bizarre music video for \\"Summertime Clothes\\", and then decided to check out their album MERRIWEATHER POST PAVILION on which that track appears. I was looking forward to it, having heard that Animal Collective is exploring a psychedelic style that looks back to the 1960s, an era I'm keenly interested in.<br /><br />Electronic effects are wildly piled on top of each other. An overall tonality is maintained, but every instrumental part seems to be going its own direction. But unfortunately, I'm quite disappointed by the album. The band's psychedelic stylings seem a bit recherch&eacute; instead of the actual result of psychedelic experiences. Perhaps the biggest flaw are the vocals, which are fairly pop-sounding and aren't zany like the music would demand. To my ears, it sounds like a boy band is singing over musical textures made by someone else. I also feel that there's a lack of variety on the album; so many tracks are cut from the very same cloth.<br /><br />There's no doubt an audience for this record, so my two-star rating should be read in context. But people approaching it from the same background and with the same expectations as me might be disappointed.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Stargate Universe Season 2 was just beginning to interest me when SYFY took it off the air. Why they did this I do not know. Wish that it could have had another season to build on. Bought both seasons and will re-watch. Don't have to be a Stargate fan to appreciate the complex story line of the show. Recommended for any science fiction fan. Will SYFY ever have another great show like SG-1, or BSG? or at least give them more time to build a larger fan base, before yanking them off the air.

B0044DEAUA|4.0|Super easy to install, sync and use.  Clear audio and clear voice transmission to  the other end.  Only down side is the voice dailer is a little touch and go, but it is on my phone as well.  Best results telling it to dial a number versus a name.  As another review here said, the bluetooth signal is STRONG, we have to turn off the BT on the phone when we're in the house or it will stay connected.  It does disconnect if you get far enough (20 meters +) away so if you go into a mall or something you don't have to worry about it.  This honestly functions and sounds on par with the system in my 2009 BMW 335 (which can't simultaneously sync two phones) for about a millionth the price.  Great buy
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|No doubt this game is fun, but I just bougt this for $1.99 and now they have a free version? Like seriously if they are going to make a game, don't make a paid version and then a free version. that really pisses people off. just sayin.

0345803485|1.0|I can't believe the back of this book says, \\"A GoodReads Choice Awards finalist for Best Romance.\\" Romance?! There is none in this book. Take arrogant male dominates submissive, stupid young female with lots of kinky sex - and that's all you have in this book. There is no plot, no character development, and the writing is boring enough to put you to sleep. I couldn't even finish this trash.

0985081821|5.0|My 9 Reader 'Hot-Buttons' on THE FOREVER GIRL by Rebecca Hamilton    1. World's Immersion:  We arrive in Sophia's \\"ordinary world\\" of Belle Meadow, Colorado, an isolated mountain-town, inside Sophia's ostracized P.O.V. working at a diner surrounded by small town scrutiny. We follow Sophia into her private world, inside the generations old house she inherited from her Grandfather, or to Paloma's intriguing metaphysical shop with its special curiosities.  We learn of Sophia's world as she stumbles on the realization, that supernatural beings are converging all around her, and her supposedly ordinary, small town.  This gradually opening aperture into the world of \\"The Forever Girl\\" is how Rebecca Hamilton introduces her new series to enthrall Readers...    2. Characters/Icons:  In SOPHIA, we have a heroine who instantly identifies Readers with the outsider icon, a status many of us can empathize with.  Sophia's core secret grants both an emotional 'Achilles Heel' as well as seeds for expanding into her personal mythology. Sophia's adherence to Wiccan practices and ethical considerations offers Readers a female character with a refreshing, positive-minded Occult P.O.V.    CHARLES, Sophia's romantic challenge, is a refined supernatural being.  He captivates Sophia's intrigue with his knowing sensuality.  He is the first guy who gets what Sophia is thinking and feeling. The other mix in this cocktail, is that Charles' very nature poses risk, even threat toward Sophia's ultimate love or doom.  RH takes time in exploring the magnetism between Sophia and Charles as two very different supernatural beings.  Can Sophia and Charles safely co-exist, in a dangerous relationship they are both intent on deepening?    IVORY:  She is Sophia's friend, the reflection character who defies such designation, with her own complexity of emotional journey.  Ivory is not just there listening to Sophia as her BFF sounding board.  Ivory, as a supporting character, surprised me with the depth towhich her own mystery eventually unfolds.    PALOMA:  Sophia has a mentor-figure in Paloma, her guide with access to mystical items beyond the reach of just any ordinary shop-keeper, and indispensable to the heroine on a mythic journey.    MRS. FRANKLIN:  The counter-point to Sophia's gentle approach to Spirit...in the form of judgmental bile and Mrs. Franklin's own orchestrated perversion of religious orthodoxy.  This cult figure has her baleful eye set on righteously striking Sophia down for 'the good of the town.'    THALIA:  A vampiric vixen with a fang for Charles, and a harpy's derision for Sophia.  When Thalia discovers Charles and Sophia's secret, she is fully capable of driving a stake through the heart of their relationship.    VALERIA & HENRY LIETTE:  Charles' parents made him what he is; and what he is, becomes a key to the warning between he and Sophia.  The Liettes appear in Sophia's life like a visitation from some dark fairy-tale...passing by for creature comforts and a mysterious exchange.    3. Structural Appointments:  RH oscillates between Sophia's first person view-point, and breaking away into historical back-story branches, following supporting characters in third person narrative.  With this structure, RH simultaneously involves Readers in Sophia's personal quest, also freeing perspective to advance the story in broadening strokes.  Historical layers add substantial support to the core, modern-day story.    4. \\"Visuality\\":  RH is adept at capturing essential details.  When in more intimate scenes, dialogue and gesture rule, focusing awareness into noting emotional/psychological details shifting behind what is expressed.  RH is selective and tasteful with beats of sensory awareness or aesthetic richness.  RH capably displays her flair for writing with a sense like a movie lens, as dramatic action takes the stage.    5. Thematic/Mythic Appeals:  Is \\"Forever\\" desirable...unattainable...or a curse?  Facing an unbalanced relationship of secrets kept, becomes a possible deal-breaker in Sophia's emotional opening.  How does Sophia bridge the vast gap between 'here today, gone tomorrow' and 'forever?'    One key to my higher interest in Rebecca Hamilton's \\"Forever Girl,\\" is the theme of Personal Inner Power.  It is the way that RH directs this journey of a young woman transforming her curse into currency, that fills this story with promise.  The author accomplishes this Occult tale with good taste intact.  I have had my own positive experiences with Wicca, and understand The Craft to be empowering for women and men, nature-based, and benevolent.  Sophia is a heroine I could identify with on this level:  magic manifests from within.    6. Story Flow:  \\"The Forever Girl\\" unravels in a gradual unfurling of mysteries comprising its elements; but RH's telling of it, is economically achieved.  Readers are kept involved with pace, clarity, immediacy of details, and progression of a world's depth.  There are no bogged-down sections where one may lose connectivity.    I enjoyed my discovery of what lay in wait, because the details were freshly devised.  I naturally wanted to journey with the characters' discoveries, as the story deepened its scope while maintaining its mystery.  I trusted in Rebecca's vision, and went along for the fantastical ride.    7. Innovation/Genre-Blend:  Rebecca has added an extra dimension to her hybrid-genre, \\"An Urban Fantasy / Paranormal Romance,\\" with \\"of the Occult.\\"  There has always been an under-the-surface cultural fear of this supernatural being, the Witch, as it has been expressed in popular literature.  It is only in recent years, that progressions have been made by writers such as Rebecca Hamilton, looking for the depth in this Wise Woman Iconography.    How to connect the vampire, were-creature, ghost, witch and any other supernatural creatures of diverse differences, into a frame-work that is fantasy-grounded, and more significant, than arbitrary inclusion?  HOW the author accomplishes this creation, is also what I feel is fresh about \\"The Forever Girl.\\"    8. Author's Voice/Language:  Rebecca Hamilton expresses an indie alternative view-point, rare to be depicted in mainstream publishing.  RH's writing-style displays lyrical details with an elegant clarity.  RH shows her writing range, in that she confidently shifts between intimate character exchanges, to a narrator's  unraveling of historical back-story, to a surprising ferocity in the violence depicted when ever it arrives.  RH strikes harder in an action sequence than I actually expected, granting a gravity of threat to Charles and Sophia's challenges.  \\"The Forever Girl\\" is not a gory reality, but still an appropriately dangerous one to enjoy.    9.  The After Resonance:  Sophia is an inspired avatar for demographics of younger and older Wiccan/Goth/Alternative sub-cultures. These are Reading audiences that have always sought out edgy, underground Books to exemplify their cultural P.O.V.  Sophia taps into a very large Reading audience, which when considered separate, may at an earlier time have been considered 'Fringe.'  They are in fact, cultural prime movers, and a big part of making Comicon such a mainstream phenomenon.  Sophia's journey to personal empowerment through recognizable growing pains and opening sexuality, gives her universal New Adult appeal.    I want to point out that RH's book is in the \\"New Adult\\" range of audience, a flex-period in maturing growth experiences or life experimentation.  Key characters are seeking their adult lives, chiefly between late teens to the mid 20's, or just before entering their 30's.  In New Adult, RH was able to offer a more sophisticated Occult angle, a more adult sensuality between Sophia and Charles, graphic conflict; and yet, a YA audience would be entirely in range for appreciating the novel's youthful voice in Sophia.  Rebecca tweeted about the \\"New Adult Genre,\\" being the first to inform me that this range has a niche designationin publishing, as \\"Young Adult\\" popularly has.    I feel that in Sophia, Readers have a feminine character with heart and mystique, an accessible vulnerability to identify with, yet a willful heroism so as to engage a Reader on numerous levels.  Sophia is also not being constantly saved by Charles, her male counterpart; because Readers will find, in all key points where actions must be taken, that it is Sophia herself who rises to the challenges of her own growth arc.  RH has also fashioned a world of cohesive, supporting mythology that opens a well-latticed capacity for fulfilling further stories.  It is easy to foresee \\"The Forever Girl\\" series deepening its supernatural potential...and fan-base.    Andre Hirsch Todorovich, Transcendentalist Writer ~ [...]

B00005NMXI|4.0|Exaggerations aside, one thing must be said: this guy did know how to write a good song. Never mind the arguments about who is the best songwriter of the world. His music is not about making comparisons, it's about being comprehended. And when it comes to Townes Van Zandt, that doesn't take a lot of effort from the listener. You just need a few verses, some seconds of music and, if you really concentrate on what you hear as you listen (note that these are two very different things), that's it. He's got you.<br />His discography, however, may cause some people to be confused. Many songs on the first two albums (which constitute disc 1 of this box set) were recorded with different arrangements on the following ones. Maybe because he knew they didn't need all that radio-friendly production they were submitted to. They could be simple as hell and still mean a lot (or even more than they already did). That also makes the task of pointing out his best or most accomplished record a bit hard. But in the end, it all depends on your personal taste as a listener, because the consistence of Van Zandt's universal approach remains intact.<br />This box set includes his first 7 albums and part of the live recording that was released on the double album Live at The Old Quarter. Also, you get an extensive booklet containing lots of pictures, biographical notes and track-by-track comments. Note that there are two versions of this release: the first one, from 2002, has a book-like format, while the 2005 edition comes in an actual box. But I believe that both carry the same content (although I can't be sure if the box has the same visual appeal and graphic content the book does).<br />But enough with technicalities. The music here surpasses everything. Van Zandt had something that is inherent only to those with a high sense of life and perception. He seems to understand you as much as you will probably understand him, and that is what makes a songwriter so influential and respected. You relate to his thoughts the more you give them a listen, despite the irregular discography. Wherever you start this journey, the aftermath will probably be worth the trip.u relate to his thoughts the more you give them a listen, despite the irregular discography. Wherever you start this journey, the aftermath will probably be worth the trip.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is without a doubt one of my most favorite books of all time. Save yourself a little money if you like and purchase the Omnibus Edition of Wool becuase if you read the first book you will without a doubt HAVE to read the rest.<br /><br />I read mostly historical non-fiction but the first book was recomended to me by Amazon for less than a dollar so I read the free preview and could not wait the three seconds it took my Kindle to connect and download the book. Fantastic collection of stories following several characters lives in a world possibly not too far out of reach from our own.<br /><br />I won't go into detail about every book individually here, mostly because as the author recommends in his Q & A at the end of this book he likes reviews on each book lol. I respect his humor and his writing so I will indeed go back and review them all. I will say that book five is quite a bit longer than one, two is a little slower than the rest with a big set up, three and four have so much meat it's like Thanksgiving! Book five of course leaves you just like the others wanting more.<br /><br />I have already purchased the prequel book to Wool but have not read it yet so I am looking forward to starting it tonight and probably finishing it tomorrow!
B0035G1K7S|5.0|This is a wonderful rock and roll documentary.<br /><br />It ranks up there witht he best of them , because this is one of those rare experiences where you get a great mix of new interviews and new inside info into the band, however that mystery that surrounds the White Stripes never goes away. It's as if they are willing to let you into there world for a peek, but you can't come all the way in. Still, there are many telling moments of the relationship and creative partnership between Jack and Meg.<br /><br />This is not a concert movie, but a ride along with the band as they travel through Canada, meeting people along the way, playing different venues, stopping off for sight seeing, and photo sessions. While doing so they give tid bits of insight into their process (i.e. No set lists for the shows, and Jack's preference for guitars that don't stay in tune).<br /><br />But, don't be turned away if you are seeking concert footage, in between the mini interviews and mingling with Canadians, there are some fantastic performances here! The great thing is that the performances and song selections touch on their entire career, they perform songs from every album including the first, so it's a very good retrospective of what they've done through the years. The footage is increadible!<br /><br />The other plus to this documentary is the way it was shot, I like the retro grainy footage, and the black and white. There is color thrown in here and there, but this is primarily a black and white, film, and isn't that fitting. If there's one thing to say about the White Stripes, it's that they keep the formula simple. Simple colors, simple instruments, and simple song structures. But, much like black and white photography and video, it's all about what is done within the walls of the limitations. The White Stripes set up that formula in order to test and stretch it to the max, and this films gives you a taste of how that is done.<br /><br />Highly Recommended
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I wish I could write a review on each of the volumes I have read, but unfortunately I cannot. I read the first 7 volumes in about two nights a piece so I can't break each book down.<br /><br />I will say I loved the show first then read the books. I have never been really into comics but I am really addicted to these.  I can't wait for the 8th book to come out so I can continue the saga.<br /><br />If you like the show you will love the books.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|I have a good suround sound system and the quality of both performance and mixing/engineering on this DVD takes maximum advantage of the technology and easily makes it the best I own. The Eagles were a hit machine and if you're a fan of their stuff, it's all in here and done to absolute perfection. I had it on as background music (and visual) for a New Year's Eve party (all baby boomers) and soon enough we were all gathered in front of the TV with the sound cranked, and watched it in its entirety. No home with an Eagles fan should be without this!!!!

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Dittos on all the digital copy reviews.  If you have any expectations of using the digital copy in iTunes, you will not be able to do it.  UltraViolet is an online streaming service.

1612130283|2.0|I've not finished 50 Shades. I'm not sure I can. I really like hot, erotic, emotionally deep stories but this one has gone 0 for 3 on those elements so far. I was super excited to see an erotic novel make it to the top of the best seller list. US readers seem to be so puritanical in their reading pleasure I had doubt a story such as this could ever make it. I'm thoroughly disappointed this is the story to hit the top, however.<br /><br />Ana - ack! A lip biting, stumbling, bumbling virgin who can't seem to think the word vagina must less say it out loud. Come on! I could understand and relate to trepidation and uncertainty and even ignorance in sexuality but she has an IQ of 4 when it comes to her own body and desires. And her descriptions of her exploits with Christian are so clinical I feel like I need to be wearing a white coat.<br /><br />Christian - double ack! he's no alpha male but that could be ok with me. I like the passionate, reserved beta male but he doesn't even make it to this category. He can go from aroused to bored in 2 nanoseconds. Frankly, I have whiplash from trying to keep up with his emotional instability and it's even worse when trying to decipher these things from Ana's point of view.<br /><br />I've gotten through the first 2 sex scenes, not even making it to the BDSM elements so far but the writing is so stale and stiff I have no desire to go further. The only thing tempting me to keep reading so far is to be able to discuss the book with others that read it.<br /><br />Part two - I did finally finish the book. I was about 40-50% through when I wrote the above review and I can't say I've changed my mind on much. Ana doesn't really evolve beyond the lip-biting bumbler presented at the beginning of the book. You do see some minute change with Christian but I'm not sure it's enough to make me want to read the other 2 books.<br /><br />As for the sex...eh. To call this book erotic is lame. It's sensual at best. To call it a book about a BDSM relationship is a farce. There's one scene I would consider BDSM related and it's so clinical and told from above that it's hard to get any sense of the varied and intricate nature of a BDSM relationship. Christian wouldn't be called a dominant in the real world of BDSM. He might have some qualities but he mostly is a wounded, broken man who's trying to control his lack of emotional self-awareness by exerting control over Ana, who has more of a backbone at times than he does.<br /><br />I find it funny that America considers this book hot and naughty and a shocker. I will admit that I find the emails shared between Christian and Ana to be funny at times. That's the only real bright spot I can find in this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun and also hard to put down! Some them are easy and some are really hard! Good mix!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Tantalizingly seductive.  Even Dr. Oz has figured this to be the most sexually liberating experience of this generation.  My friends, male and female, have read and thoroughly enjoyed the book and all of its aftermaths.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Simply put, the remaster of this is simply awful. The dynamics are ruined by the compression. The original CD sounds very good & the DCC gold version mastered by Steve Hoffman is simply excellent. If you appreciate sound quality & have a decent system, buy the earlier versions. Your ears will thank you. The bonus tracks are all available on CD singles in much better quality too.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow! I wasn't going to write a review but I changed my mind because I really can't believe how bad this book is!  It was recommended to me by someone who read all 3 and said she is going to re-read the whole series so I thought it must be good.  I can't even get thru half of book one!  It is so far-fetched and juvenile, I would rather read anything else but this book!  If I read \\"he is so good looking\\" one more time, I'm just going to delete it from my Kindle!
B0000931QA|5.0|If you're reading this, you likely know how great the album is. I'll simply speak the word on the sound quality. The remaster is a total compressed mess. The dynamic range has been crushed out of it. This applies to the rest of the albums in the catalog. The original CD is far better & that's the issue worth buying.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out for my kindle fire! It is soooooo good! Definately a great choice and it's free :D
080214473X|5.0|With BLACK HAWK DOWN, Mark Bowden gives the valorous Rangers, Delta operators, and Night Stalker pilots who fought in the savage Battle of Mogadishu on October 3-4, 1993 perhaps the greatest monument possible by crafting a definitive moment-by-moment record that faithfully tells their story and ensures it will not be forgotten or otherwise lost to history.  Bowden has produced an intense, riveting, exhaustively-researched novelistic depiction of modern urban warfare in all its stark brutality and chaos, told from the human perspectives of the soldiers on-the-ground who lived it.  He does so in a refreshingly straightforward manner that respects the subject matter at all times and eschews the reflexive anti-war cynicism, exploitation, and editorializing that so often mars modern war reporting.  The result is nothing short of a masterpiece.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I know the title is very cliche, but it says it all. This was one of those reads that I didn't want to finish because it tantalised my mind so much - a bit like how a really tasty dinner or fabulous wine is to the tastebuds. When I finished this I immediately downloaded book 2 and 3 - which I can honestly say are just as captivating as the first one!<br /><br />This book is Big Brother vs Survivor in its plot, but the great thing about it is you really feel the struggle that Katniss and Peeta experience; not just the struggle to survive, but the moral dilemmas they face and value judgments they have to make.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this as well as the rest of the trilogy.
B005TVYVI2|2.0|I really like the functionality of this product but it's reliability leaves something to be desired.  Mine quit working on me after less than a month.  I managed to mget it working again for a week or two but then it packed up again.  I chad the battery, thinking maybe I got a dud, but no joy.  Let's hope the distributor stands behind the product.
B004LROMQG|4.0|The dvd's arrived quickly and in good condition.  My only wish is that the cover had a listing of all the episodes on each CD.  But since this is the only USA compatible version I've found, it is what it is.
B005LBN7WQ|5.0|Westlife is one of my favorite groups to listen to.  The harmony and sound are perfect.  No matter how difficult the day may be for me, Westlife ALWAYS refreshes the soul and renews the spirit.  Their music gives words to my feelings for my wife and reminds me how precious she is to me.  Thank you Amazon for making their music available.  I think Westlife is one of the best Irish imports into our nation.  Perfect music for easy listening.  The CDs are great.  (I have had problems with the quality of the DVDs even when purchasing the correct ones for usage in the USA.)  But the CDs are awesome.  Since the group has never performed in the USA, the CDs are a great price compared to traveling to the UK to attend a live concert.
B003XMWSSY|4.0|As is often the case with the best educational resources, The First Five Pages contains little that is new--or should be new to any serious writer. What it does provide, however, is a logical and concise framework in which to hang a large number of related concepts and ideas. It's not really about just openings, of course, and is a useful enough addition the the education of the professional, if inexperienced, author.<br /><br />I can find only two points worthy of criticism. First, many of the examples are so obvious as to hold little utility. Second, he used the word \\"Transudes\\" incorrectly, where clearly he meant \\"transmutes\\" or \\"transforms\\" or something along those lines. These are minor points though, and more than made up for with brevity and coherence.
B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worst movies in the horror/ghost category ever made. The only scary parts were listening to the coffee clerk talk about her boyfriend. If you take anything away from this review please know I watched hundreds of movies each year and this is one of the worst I have EVER seen. And what is sad is that it is a great idea for a movie.
0545305497|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter, who had already read all the books before (borrowed) and had sent the movie...for the 1st time.  She wanted to re-read all the books, and have the trilogy in her book collection.  Plus she has seen the movie again.  So, very well-received, great to get a trilogy in soft-cover.  Thanks for your quick shipping.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Great game. very good play and easy to learn. Four suits makes a great addicting game but the ads between EVERY HAND is rediculus. I would rather pay a buck to avoid them and am always looking for a decent Paid solitaire game.
B00005J6T0|5.0|At the beginning of the Summer of 1986, radio, MTV and Cassette tapes were at the height of enjoyment.  The weather was hot and radio stations were already playing those upbeat Summer songs, but listeners were stunned when they heard the first rushes of an orchestrated flush of a slow tempo song instead called \\"Live to Tell\\".  The reason they were thrown off was because this was Madonna, who at the time was beyond famous, but only known for singing catchy bubble gum songs of pop fun.  The world was emulating her overstated fashion sense, but she changed that with this album.<br /><br />This isn't just a classic because of that, or that it branded her once again as a trailblazer.  This album had a classier tone in order to reel in more of the adult audience which it did successfully.  Acoustic guitars and drums were used as opposed to the synthesizers on her first two albums.  This is a strong album and holds its own.  It hit #1 all around the world and produced 6 major hits which can't even be done today: Papa Don't Preach, Open Your Heart, Live To Tell, Where's the Party, True Blue and La Isla Bonita.<br /><br />This remastered disc has (2) additional bonus tracks.  Remixes of La Isla Bonita and True Blue. The only complaint I have of this is I wish that she and the record company would've thought to go ahead and ad, \\"Who's That Girl\\" and \\"Causing a Commotion\\".  Two songs that were both hits, recorded for the \\"Who's That Girl\\" soundtrack and came out during the True Blue era.  It would've been fitting for this.<br /><br />This is a true gem and if you still don't have this album, what are you waiting for?
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I ordered it for my kindle (which is also one of my favorite things).  The book took a little while to get me hooked, but once hooked I had a hard time putting it down. It's a little different from the usual Stephen King story lines in that it is based on historical facts.  However, the author has a way of telling the story that keeps you guessing, even at the end, was it one man or a conspiracy?  Highly recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game its so fun! I'm so happy right now beacause I always wanted this game on my kindle fire!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game very addicting it makes you want to keep playing to unlock the other fun games. I like the serpent game its just like.oldschool snake.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|This movie sucks, simple as that. It's boring as all heck, and I wasn't even paying full attention to it. I would have left the theater screaming if I'd paid $12 to see this crap. Don't let the hype fool you; I have NO IDEA why everyone was looking forward to this film.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|Sorry folks, I really could not stand this meaningless, self-indulgent film.  Worst of all, it uses the ancient culture of India as a backdrop for a pointless, unrealistic story.  It is realistic in one respect.  It shows how wealthy, emotionally insipid people from the first world, use countries like India in a consumerist attempt at spiritual tourism.  I have worked and lived in India and have seen a lot of these types come to try to buy a way out of their personal emptiness.  Like a drug, it is initially intoxicating and they feel different but in time,  the illusion wears off and they are off to indulge themselves in the next such escape. The people and places they go are just things to be consumed as the characters did in this movie before they supposedly transformed themselves.  To be fair, the movie is beautifully shot and the actors perform their roles with professionalism. The fault is in the story and script.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book should be required reading in ever school. It completely changed the way I view my peers, and shows how EVERYTHING is interconnected, and how you never know if something you do can effect someone in a way you couldn't imagine.

B0076NAX42|5.0|Best album of the year so far... Suitable for all prog rock fans as well as rock fans in general, it covers a wide range of styles, everybody must check it out
B007JU5HSO|5.0|The first Cd at 68.18 min. has the entire Aqua and finishes with Epsilon in Malaysian pale part 1 .CD two 62.05, starts with part 2 of EMP, Ages sides one and two. Third CD 72.36 follows with Ages side three and four, Nights of automatic women, Icarus, Children's deeper study, Ode to granny A, Pizzaro and Attahaullpa, Golgaha, Circle Closes and the first three tracks of Stuntman ending disc 3. CD4 at 66.34 min. continues with side two of Stuntman and the entire Pinnacles. Only Aqua and Pinnacles are in one cd the rest are split like the two sided LPs.<br />The best buy here is the original or \\"untanginized\\" Epsilon in Malaysian Pale, which has been unavailable on CD and if it does at rip off meant not to be bought, utterly ridiculous prices. All the sets are claimed to be re mastered but undistinguishable from previous releases.<br />There are also 4 bonus tracks found somewhere within the set, each taken from the LP `Edgar Froese Solo 1974-79' and never released on CD. The errors are confusing to keep track as you listen which is really a bugger- Epsilon' (from Solo 1974-9) is actually `Tropic Of Capricorn', Disc 3 track 8 or Tropic Of Capricorn (from solo 1974-79)' plays `IF 810' from Macula transfer. Totally muddled, very annoying.<br />Content is excellent with all 6 albums minus Macula Transfer, the booklet has credits extracted from the original releases unfortunately not as elegant and accurate as TD's virgin year's booklet. Cost is reasonable from 20-30 dollars for the whole set. It comes in those standard thick 2 cd jewel case but this can hold 4 cds so very handy.<br />If you already have all EF's cds then this is redundant but if you only have one or two surely this is less costly than buying the individual albums.<br />I already have all the cds of EF and I bought this to encourage and support Virgin to release more Tangerine Dream and former member's recordings hidden somewhere in the vaults. Hopefully Virgin will release TD soundtracks like The Soldier and Peter Baumann's long out of print cds with Virgin.and Peter Baumann's long out of print cds with Virgin.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is first and foremost an autobiography and not and instruction book about how to memorize. If you want that, may I recommend why the Sheep Falls out of the Tree (or something like that)<br /><br />That being said, this autobiography has really helped me understand how the brain works and it introduced the idea of Memory Palaces to me. This concept of using the brain to imagine and create connections was something that thrilled me and lead me to do a lot of research on the subject. Once that was done, I introduced the idea to my Drama and English Literature students and they really benefited from the ideas.<br /><br />In addition to that helpful 5% of the book, the autobiography is funny, witty, and just plain interesting. I totally recommend this book.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its kind of like temple run&hellip;but way better. I play it all the time. I need at least six other words!

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is an amazing game. ive been waiting for it forever because the rest of my family had it. it is just as fun as they though it was and if u want to complain about the ads and few choices. buy the full version
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|I have not read the comic book and I must say after reading a small sample of them I do not know if I would enjoy it much. It is sad because I do love reading comics and I am an illustrator myself. The TV show is just so good! The first season is especially fantastic and the second season is great too.<br />I would recommend this show.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book. Kept you on the edge of your seat. Many twist kept you guessing until the end. After which I had to finish the trilogy. Am in the middle of Hornets Nest now, same edge of my seat writing.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|From all the hype about Hunger Games, one might expect this book to rate among futuristic classics.  It does not, at least for me.  Don't get me wrong, it was a fairly good read.  The author does a pretty good job of making you feel overall contempt for the \\"Capital\\" and sympathy for residents of the \\"Districts\\".  Unfortunately, that's about all there is except for the underlying development of a teenage romantic stress.  Reasonably entertaining - but not really my cup of tea.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Right now (April, 2012), this is probably the best choice when building a high-performing-but-not-overly-expensive computer.<br />It's priced close to the previous incumbent, the 2600k, and mobo prices are converging as well.<br />It really destroys everything you can imagine, and keeping asking for more.<br />The one thing I would say is that Intel's X79 - your only choice if your going with Intel processors today - is not, by a wide margin, as good a chipset is i7 3xxx are as processors. I mean, support to USB 3 and Sata III is dismal, to say the least.<br />But that is another story...
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I crave romance in every book I read. If there is no romance, not even a spark, then I will rarely enjoy the book. Sometimes though the romance is flat, boring or too forced.<br /><br />In Master of Crows the romance was absolutely perfect. In fact I finished the book two days ago and I am still sighing over it. Incredible job done on this one and I adored the characters, all of them. There is sex, there is anger, there is love and tension and heartache. Oh it was succulent to read and immensely satisfying.<br /><br />If you crave romance like I do, then I urge you to pick up this book. You will regret it if you don't.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I luv being able 2 have gods word read 2me at work in between breaks and nightly before bed. Thanks kindle for this apps.<br /><br />i
B007IX383I|3.0|Most anticipated and most disappointing release of the year. The first 3 songs are schmaltzy. The strings are overused. Unlike the author, I found the spoken lyrics banal and completely unnecessary. Where's the prog rock? Where are the guitars (and I don't mean acoustic)?<br />\\"Falling Deeper\\" was a disaster. With all the violins, pop radio ballads, and the talking song, \\"Weather Systems\\" isn't too far behind.<br />Nice album if you like \\"pretty\\" music; otherwise forget it.<br />2 stars and that may be generous!<br />UPDATE May 25, 2012: I used an editor to get rid of the talking intro to the last cut. It improved the album enough to add 1 star. Still not their best but listenable. Some of the lyrics are still kinda cornball.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|great game like angry birds but a little easier. works great on my Kindle Fire. both of my children really like playing

0307888908|5.0|The cofounder and chairman of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, with cowriter, Ben Casnocha, show anyone wanting to manage their career how to succeed. I wish I'd had this book before leaving college - it would have saved me making many career mistakes.<br /><br />This book encourages readers to be action-oriented and act like an entrepreneur, taking responsibility for personal development. It's no good blaming society or companies for your joblessness or underemployment. \\"Your identity doesn't get found, it emerges\\". The many examples, both personal and corporate, come mainly from Silicon Valley.<br /><br />Analyze your assets, look at your value and invest in yourself is the message.  Each chapter has actions to help you manage your time, aspirations and skills. The book is down-to-earth pushing readers to be realistic about the market for their skills and dreams.<br /><br />Here are some of the authors' ideas:<br /> - pick a hill to climb, but pick one that has less competition<br /> - find career surrogates - people doing what you want to do and follow them online<br /> - pivot as you learn, don't get stuck in a rut, have Plan A and backup Plan B<br /> - have coffee with 5 people in adjacent niches so you can pivot to them if necessary<br /> - don't worry if your career progresses in fits and starts - sometimes fast, sometimes slowly<br /> - be curious, converse, don't interrogate<br /> - use your existing networks, it's easier than cold-calling<br /> - do the hustle, \\"Hustler is bad,but hustle is all good.\\"<br /><br />The book has references for further reading.  Books mentioned include [[ASIN:0446678791 Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself]], [[ASIN:0385483821 Only the Paranoid Survive: How to Exploit the Crisis Points That Challenge Every Company]], [[ASIN:030746086X Different: Escaping the Competitive Herd]] and [[ASIN:1439170428 Little Bets: How Breakthrough Ideas Emerge from Small Discoveries]].<br /><br />Don't make these career mistakes, mentioned in the book:<br /> - going for money above all else in a job<br /> - choosing a company for what you can get, rather than what you can give<br /> - being too self-reliant and independent - world-class people need world-class networks<br /> - hiring mediocre people<br /><br />There's plenty more. This is a useful reference that would make a great gift for the recent college grad and underemployed veteran alike. If you are a pro at job seeking, it's worth buying the book for the \\"To Do lists\\" that conclude each chapter.in the book:<br /> - going for money above all else in a job<br /> - choosing a company for what you can get, rather than what you can give<br /> - being too self-reliant and independent - world-class people need world-class networks<br /> - hiring mediocre people<br /><br />There's plenty more.

1451627289|4.0|Readers who like to settle in and spend a lot of time with a well-told story should consider Stephen King's latest novel, 11/22/63. King's imagination soars as he considers the question of what would have happened if Kennedy wasn't shot and killed in 1963. The device he uses to riff on this topic is time travel, and by using protagonist Jake Epping as an everyman who gets to decide the future of reality itself. A lot of the book is a love story that is endearing and important to the plot. Changing the past has consequences, and as King restates often, \\"the past is obdurate,\\" it does not want to change. Jake finds events become harmonized and his best plans can lead to unexpected outcomes. This is fine story telling with just enough speculation and imagination to keep a reader interested and willing to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|the entire family gets together over this game.....Our getting to the next level sometimes takes all of our input.  Lots of high fives going on here !~ Love the challenges of Cut the Rope !
B006T3RM08|5.0|Bought this product despite other users' warnings and was pleasantly surprised. The Clique worked exactly as advertized. The wireless keyboard and magic trackpad clicked in nicely without any lost functionality. The unit is made of a sturdy white plastic very much up to Apple standards in terms of fit and finish. The combined gadgets work well sitting on your lap or other uneven surface.

B007UXTG8M|1.0|But then again, maybe not.  I think the performances were good.  The pacing is interminable.  Of course, I wanted to watch two hours following people who might not have been really people, but some sort of avatars.  I got the same warm fuzzies here as I did when I saw \\"Leaving Las Vegas.\\"  In that movie, a guy aims to drink himself to death.  He succeeds!!!<br /><br />When I took screenwriting classes, the teachers warned against having people eat dinner.  They did that.  There were scenes at bars.  In offices!!!  What thrills!!!!

B0007LGCA4|4.0|These are very well made:  I suspect they will last years longer than the much cheaper \\"Alpine Design\\" model at Sports Authority that copies them which I wore through in one season.  I will say they aren't quite as comfortable as those, and they do run a little small.  Overall, a great sandal in the first month so far.

0446572993|5.0|Baldacci weaves quite a story with this 400 plus page novel.  I personally think he has given us a book that is well worth the time to read, and I believe that you won't be able to put it down until you get to the end.<br /><br />Will Robie is hired to assassinate people whom our government and other governments deem to be problems (maybe terrorists is the best term).  They might be political dissidents bringing corruption to the world, they might be drug dealers who are destroying the lives of thousands, or they might be terrorist who are plotting to take out innocent people.  Robie is your man.<br /><br />But when he is sent to assassinate his next target he finds himself conflicted about the kill.  It is a hard working single mom who has two small children and doesn't fit the profile of who he was sent to kill, at least not to Robie.  So, why he vacillates whether to do the job of not (while staring her down) someone else fires a shot through the window and does the job.<br /><br />This starts Robie on a path of running and examining what is going on.  He finds a young 14 year old girl whose parents have just been murdered and the killer is after her now.  He thinks he is helping her, but discovers that maybe someone, somewhere is driving the two together for a bigger purpose.<br /><br />Then enter Super Agent Vance (FBI) into the picture and Robie and Julie have a third partner trying to help them dig down and discover who the real killers are and why they are bent on killing so many innocent people.<br /><br />The tension is well written.  The characters are well developed.  The plot builds throughout the book.  i believe that if you like political/CIA type thrillers you will not be disappointed with this read.<br /><br />I have read the 1 star reviews and wonder if they even read the same book that I did.  I think the best thing you can do is realize that the majority of readers have enjoyed this book and if you are a Baldacci fan I think you will enjoy it as well.well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second book in the series, and I didn't think it was possible, but it just kept getting better and better. This is one of those books that you stay up until 3 o'clock in the morning to finish reading because you have to know what happens.  Thanks to E.L. James for writing a wonderful series with characters that you actually care about.
0545101425|2.0|I mostly listened to this book just to finish out the trilogy.  If that is what you are doing, then go ahead and do it.  If you are reading this book (as opposed to an audio book), then I feel sorry for you.  I would have never finished this book if I was reading it.  The story line is VERY choppy and feels piece-milled just to stretch the story.  In the end, there are still some confusing things about it.  Now, to be honest, I did not find the \\"Hunger Games\\" a great story or particularly well written.  It was good, but certainly not great.  The second book kept my interest, but I was just glad to finish this one.  So, read this if you are just interested in how it ends, but do not expect a great story or writing.
B001GJ3BPU|3.0|Beyond its dramatic opening shot of the titular character clinging to a church cross, the movie offers nothing of substance. There isn't one actor in this film who isn't miscast and the flashback storytelling is pointless.<br /><br />STILL, although this isn't the greatest of Marvel's hero flicks, it's not the worst either--though it's Elektra spinoff just might be. Daredevil offers some dark and gritty fun that's not just stylized action for the kiddies. Though there isn't any major profanity, gory violence, or sex, the content of the film is much more mature, and its metaphors and character archs are probably beyond the understanding of most kids and teens.<br /><br />On a technical level, this movie fails. On a faithful adaptation level, this movie fails. In many other ways, this movie fails. But I can't help but enjoy it because it's simply so different from all the other kid-friendly stuff that Marvel has made thus far.<br /><br />Daredevil is an average movie that's better than its average kin.

1849163863|5.0|I bought this book an a lark, I think it was part of a Kindle special. I didn't expect much and I was very surprised at how engrossing the story was right from the start. The characters and the setting also took hold of me. I found myself thinking about this book at night as I lay in bed, to the point where I was unable to fall asleep. I don't know exactly why this book resonated with me, but even now, months after finishing it, I find I still think about it the way one might fondly remember a vacation spot.<br /><br />The second book in the series, \\"The Lewis Man\\", is equally enjoyable & memorable, by the way!

0345803485|1.0|After reading a few of the other reviews, I was relieved to see I am not alone, so decided to put my two cents in.<br /><br />I am only 23% through this book and I think that is as far as I am going to get. I did not read any reviews before I purchased it, and wish I had. I had heard a lot of buzz about it, saw it was number one on the bestseller list, and as I'm always into discovering new authors, decided to give it a go.<br /><br />My very first thought only a few pages in was that E L James and Stephenie Meyer must have gone to the same get-your-degree-out-of-a-crackerjack-box writing classes, and the same oh-god-help-me-I-have-to-find-the-next-big-thing publisher. I could at least be okay with the Twilight series (until they became movies starring Kristen Stewart, but I digress). My very first thought was that these characters were exactly like Bella and Edward. Dark, brooding, mysterious, controlling man meets naive, clumsy, full of issues woman and wants to make her his own. Blech. Been there, done that.<br /><br />Then, 18 percent into the book, I hit what everyone is talking about and to be honest, I could not stop laughing. If throbbing members, heaving bosoms, and alabaster thighs were described I would not have been surprised. It's like the worst cheesy romance novel I have ever read. And I haven't read many for this very reason--they  make me laugh.<br /><br />Now maybe I haven't, ah, truly lived--but I'm sorry. No one has THAT many orgasms THE VERY FIRST TIME THEY HAVE SEX. If you're going to describe this big sexual awakening and initiation, make it believable. I would guess at least seven out of ten women would admit that it totally sucks at first and then gets better after a while.<br /><br />The three other biggest things that make me certain I'm never going to make it to The Red Room of Pain:<br /><br />1. I am so sick and tired of the effect that Anastasia's 'innocent biting of her lip' has on Christian.<br />2. A heroine in this sort of sexual situation should be able to muster something more passionate than \\"holy crap!\\" as her main dialogue.<br />3. The inner goddess. SHUT UP.<br /><br />All in all, save your 9.99 and spend it on The Snow Child, which is what I wish I had done. I am only happy I did not waste my money on the entire trilogy. Instead, I'll spend my energy writing MY book. I have a journalism degree with a minor in creative writing. If this utter drivel can not only get published, but be made into (God help us!) three movies, I should be able to make something happen.<br /><br />Oye.

B007MDB71O|5.0|Just kidding. But seriously the film is great. A little plot tweaks from original books, but its all there in 2 hours. I wished for 3.  And am so sad Spiderman reboot gets sequel before it comes out, but ERB's GOM may never happen in time. To cinematic history's  detriment.    I love watching the Jasoomians lobby for the sequel. I guess I'm one. The casting of major characters like Thuvia, Xodar and Phaidor  would be so crucial and potentially star studded! Heard it here first.. Look to Dynamites graphic novels of the original text to tide  you over.

0439023521|5.0|I had never heard of this series until the movie. I put off reading it becasue they kept comparing it as the next Twlight in popularity. I've had enough of all that. My son read this in highschool for his English class and he said it was pretty good. He views reading as a way to torture the youth. So I ran across the book on sale and purchased it. I couldn't put it down. I loved it. It had just the right amount of sweetness, brutality, friendship and heartache. Makes me want to see the movie now. Will be ordering the other two in hardcovers and replacing my paperback for a keeper hardcover.

B0000025GW|3.0|Slow Train Coming is Bob Dylan's religious album, or rather, the beginning of a religious-based period of albums that progressed into the early 80's.  If THIS is what I can expect for the rest of this particular period, well... I probably won't even bother.  This is disappointing enough.<br /><br />\\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" has lyrics that explain no matter WHO you are, you're gonna have to serve *somebody*.  The slow-paced disco beats and the straight forward lyrics leave a lot to be desired, however.  The disco connection unfortunately sets the pace for the rest of the experience which, judging by the numerous positive reviews here on amazon, might make this the most overrated album in Dylan's discography.  \\"Precious Angel\\" is generic mid-tempo plodding nonsense from beginning to end.  This is by FAR the worst Dylan album up to this point.  Self Portrait had variety at least.  Slow Train Coming, musically, is a product of the times- the dreaded days of the disco movement.  Yuck.  The \\"Shine your light on me\\" chorus is almost sickeningly uncharacteristic of Dylan.  You can tell he's forcing himself to sing such a line, and I swear I can almost sense that he's about ready to break out laughing during the chorus.  The only compliment I can give is that the Jerry Garcia-inspired guitar playing is decent.<br /><br />\\"I Believe In You\\" includes a melody so soft that it's basically a lullaby with terribly bland, simplistic and lovey dovey lyrics.  Anyone who believes Dylan can't write vocal melodies would have a good point here.  Normally I'd disagree with those people but not in this case.  \\"Slow Train\\" has a somewhat groovy rhythm, okay lyrics about a woman down in Alabama and figuring out and establishing your principles.  The guitar solo is actually really good.  Best song so far.  \\"Gonna Change My Way of Thinking\\" is a MAJOR low point.  Unsatisfying and disappointing Joe Walsh style mid-tempo hard rock with a VERY lackluster heavy guitar riff chugging along for the entire duration.  I'm mystified how so many Dylan fans can easily forgive such a failed experiment.<br /><br />\\"Do Right To Me Baby (Do Unto Others)\\" is where the religious lyrics are beginning to overstay their welcome as they're now becoming excessively irritating.  The bigger problem however is that there's *still* very little in the way of exciting musical ideas taking place here.  The songwriting is definitely uninteresting to me.  Just because Dylan finally revealed his feelings on religious matters doesn't automatically mean these songs are a pleasure to hear.  \\"When You Gonna Wake Up\\" is lyrically quite tedious and straight forward despite Dylan telling it like it is.  I'm sorry but this song sounds WAY too similar to Dire Strait's \\"In the Gallery\\" released a year before.  Same vocal mannerisms and punchy rhythm.  I *do* like how the tempo picks up during the chorus at least.  Yes and I'm aware that members of Dire Straits participated on this album so Mark Knopfler's style was bound to be noticeable either way but eh... I also have mixed feelings when the Band joined Dylan.  When you combine two artists with a distinctive style the result is that it usually limits the potential of *both* artists, or rather, encourages them both to hold back their full scope of creativity which is the case here with Dylan and Knopfler.<br /><br />\\"Man Gave Name to All the Animals\\" is a reggae style tune with a strong appearance of female vocals.  Dylan's voice is exceptionally hoarse but both the verse AND the chorus are oddly melodic and appealing to me.  This song almost sounds cute!  Definitely the most unusual song on the album.  It avoids resembling generic disco beats at least.  \\"When He Returns\\" is a piano ballad but... this is no ordinary piano playing!  It's VERY spiritual, uplifting, and emotionally a highlight.  Maybe even the best song on the album both lyrically and musically.  Great way to end the album.<br /><br />Man, I don't know guys.  Songs such as \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\", \\"Precious Angel\\", \\"I Believe In You\\" and ESPECIALLY \\"Gonna Change My Way of Thinking\\" are REALLY unappealing to me.  I suppose the rest of the material is passable but come on, Dylan's first religious-themed album is hardly flawless.  Look beyond the lyrics and notice the mediocre songwriting covering up most of the album.  On a final note just let me mention that I have no problem whatsoever with the lyrics.  Dylan covers religion exceptionally well and his conversion to Christianity is commendable, but I wouldn't expect any less from the master of creative wordplay.  Besides, every Christian I've ever known has always been super polite and supportive towards me and my decisions.  The problem I have with the album is that the music doesn't match the lyrics.  Not many (if any) artists entered the dreaded, horribly dated days of the disco movement and came out with flying colors.  It's just impossible for me to look beyond the generic music and focus on the lyrics.
B004L49K20|4.0|First of all, I need to say how refreshing to the ears this album is. It's hard to imagine how a band can come up sounding so fresh & vital so late in their career. And yet, so many of the fans that were obsessed with them in the 80s wouldn't even get to hear this album at all - I know this from speaking to old friends.<br /><br />Some of the tracks like 'Girl Panic' & 'Safe' would've been big hits if given the airplay that their 80s hits received back then.<br />My favourite track would have to be the very cool title track `All You Need Is Now'. I can hear slight resemblances to U2's `Achtung Baby' in the production, which isn't a bad thing at all.<br />Blame The Machines, Being Followed, Leave A Light On, The Man Who Stole A Leopard, Other People's Lies, the interlude Return To Now, are all very good to excellent tracks. There are no actual throwaway tracks, which means the album flows very nicely.<br /><br />Overall, a very good album that's still growing on me - my star rating for this album may grow as well over time as a result.<br />This album has also inspired me to dig into their back catalogue such as 'Astronaut' which I've found to be a winner as well.<br /><br />Well done boys.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I didn't enjoy Fifty Shades of Grey: Darker, the second book in the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, nearly as much as I enjoyed the first book.<br /> I found Darker to be very repetitive and found myself skimming through quite a bit of it. There were too many sex scenes in my opinion and I thought that the book needed a better plot. Basically, there was very little plot and too much sex.<br />Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" irritated me in Darker. I was annoyed at how grateful Ana always felt for the attention that Christian gave her. Christian was very controlling and borderline abusive. Ana couldn't even see her long-term friend, Jose, without Chistian getting annoyed. Christian is often portrayed as a very damaged character but Ana is just as damaged as her lover in my opinion. Her self-esteem is very low and she constantly questions if she is worthy to be with Christian. I found it odd that two lovers refer to each other as Miss Steele and Mr. Grey on a regular basis.<br />However, I found this book to be strangely compelling. I very much wanted to find out the details of Christian's childhood which were revealed in Darker. There was a surprising twist at the end of the book, which I must admit will have me buying the third book, Freed.

That said, if instead of getting annoyed every time the main character says/thinks \\"Oh my...,\\" just read it to yourself in George Takei's voice. It improves the entertainment value by at least 63%.

0143121006|5.0|Peking China in 1937 was in turmoil.  Opium dens, prostitution, and superstitions were just the everyday concerns.  The bigger reality was that the Japanese were gearing up to barge into the city and the citizens were on alert. The murder of Pamela Werner could not have come at a worse time. With very few clues and reluctant witnesses a Chinese and a British detective have very little time to solve the gruesome murder.<br />I immediately became captivated by Pamela Werner's story and was invested in learning the conclusion. All of the little details that went into explaining the problems surrounding those who lived in the city and all of the politics that went into suppressing evidence from investigators gave me insight into the frustration of Pamela's case.  The author worked hard to tell Pamela Werner's story and it shows.  It flowed well and never felt overwhelming leaving me with an interest in learning more about the history of that time and place.  I recommend this to anyone, especially to those who enjoy true crime.

0345803485|1.0|I, too, agree with most of the people her although I gave it a lower star in order to save some people from making the same mistake I did - buying it. What a piece of crap! The writing is horrible, the story line dull after a few chapters and way to unbelievable. Male main character is rich, best looking man in world, blah, blah, blah. Female character is pathetic. I finished the first book because I just finish everything, but I will tell you, the movie will suck too. It will be one of those movies strongly marketed and many will go the first weekend, then leave the theater as fast as it can. Shame these kinds of books even get published. Someone is not doing there job. The fact that it is so popular means we should be scared as a country for our own lack of intelligence.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Love the game but where is the latest update? Google Market has had it for awhile now but it's the ad version so doesn't do any good to install it when this is the ad-free version. Please developer don't forget us over here who bought at amazon.
B007K3UVNQ|5.0|Been a long time fan of Overkill and this collection of tunes does not disappoint. They seem to be able to keep delivering great heavy music. Favs are Black Daze, Electric Rattlesnake, Drop the Hammer Down, well, all of it actually. Definitely great Overkill. And they definitely have what Blitz says, \\"Gotta a lot of mouth for a Jersey White Boy!\\"
B007IFZU5A|5.0|I completely disagree with the first reviewer ( KOURKOULOS NIKOS ). I think this is the best album this guys have released since Draconian Times, and that´s saying a lot. The fact that this album is so reminiscent to Icon and Draco, my two favorites by them, can also be a factor to make me like it even more than their later stuff, but since in the past few years they had made a comeback to their original goth/dark sound, this record cannot be compared to their late 90´s - mid 2000s synth/poprock melodic stuff. This record has their original sound, so if you are looking for their mellower melodic radio synth pop ala Depeche Mode stuff, this is not your record. This new songs sound like some of the stuff you could find in their early- mid 90s era. If that´s your thing, we are on the same page. This is a heavy album, and a very melodic one endeed. In my opinion, this is most melodic stuff they have come up in years.<br /><br />Old fans are quite happy that PD made an extreme sound shift their to old sounding classic records on their last two albums (which are pretty good), but to my ears, this record sound WAY more inspired than those records. Those two new records are good, but they lacked something. That something, which I don´t know how to describe, I found here. The Tragic Idol is the album I was waiting from this guys.<br /><br />To the record.  Almost every song, if not all, are arranged beautifully and tastefully, and in some moments, range into the amazing. Since I pressed play, I was truly blown away by how tasteful, dark, heavy, atmospheric and melodic their new stuff sounded. The record production is immaculate! The composition is absolutely inspired and the vocals are amazing. But what really destroyed my senses was how beautiful the guitars fit into their old/new sound.  Layer after layer after layer of guitar melodies on top of each other and above some of the most awesome dark riffs PD has composed in years. And even though this record is very heavyand doom, it´s also VERY melodic, but If your looking for melodic as in catchy ala One Second, I may say that some of that stuff is also here, but not as prevalent. The music is dark, heavy, very melodic, quite agressive at times, and in some occasions, sad (in the beautiful way).  This is the best guitar stuff this band has recorded in years! The guitar work are really what make this record stand out. The drumming is also quite extraordinary and it has a more metallic approach than on previous records. A lot more signature changes, up beat, fast, double bass. Quite creative for a PD record. And the last thing that I should stand out is Nick Holmes EXTRAORDINARY vocals sessions for The Tragic Idol. This is by FAR some of the best stuff he has ever recorded. He is just flawless on energy, melody and reach!<br /><br />I will give this album and absolute five stars. And for me, this is the real continuation of the Icon/Draconian era.<br /><br />I love this record.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I enjoyed this quite a bit, as did my Dad.  It was not as good as Band of Brothers, so make sure your expectations aren't too high.  Also, just a warning: it was pretty graphic, and my wife couldn't watch it with me.

0345803485|1.0|This book was horrible. I am not the type of person who feels uncomfortable talking or reading about sex, but this book was very tasteless. Here's the story line. Rich alpha male meets innocent college student and arranges a sexual relationship with her. In their relationship, she signs a contract that requires her to do anything he asks and not tell anyone about it. If that isn't degrading enough, the male character gets off on inflicting pain on and dominating the female character. ARE YOU FRIGGING KIDDING ME? What woman would read this and enjoy it? This book disgusts me because it is sending the wrong message to men. Its saying, yes, we want pain inflicted on us during sex. There is already enough domestic violence out there as it is. This book is a disgrace!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Loads of fun.  I'm on level 16 highly addicting have not encountered the time glitches some of the other users have stated. Only complaint is energy takes a while to fill up.

0307352145|5.0|Throughout my life I have had well meaning people telling me I should want to socialise all the time and that there is something wrong with me because I would almost always prefer to be curled up at home with a book. I have always had to battle for my quiet time against my nearest and dearest who think I should want to be with them. If I spend too much time with other people I start to lose sight of who I am and I have to spend a few hours by myself to recharge my batteries.<br /><br />This is something I've always known about myself. When I first heard the word `introvert' and understood its meaning I knew it applied to me. But being an introvert was something that you just didn't talk about because being the life and soul of the party was the ideal. To get on at work and in life you need to be outgoing and willing to spend all your time talking to other people. The Western world values extroversion and introverts don't count partly because it is difficult for them to make themselves heard.<br /><br />The book discusses research in the field and how the quality of introversion is displayed in the world. I found it fascinating to read about those who predicted the last recession and who said that what the banks were doing was extremely risky. Banks were staffed by extroverts who liked taking risks and they didn't want to listen to the quiet people sitting in the corner poring over graphs, charts and figures and predicting doom and gloom. What this book shows is that we need both introverts and extroverts to get a balance between excessive risk and excessive caution.<br /><br />I was intrigued to learn that it is not only human beings who are introverts or extroverts, animals and even fish have those qualities too. Guppies which live in areas of rivers where Pike feed have different personalities from those who live in the same rivers in places where Pike don't swim. If one type of Guppy moves from one area to another it takes about twenty years for their personalities to change as personality traits in Guppies seem to be inherited. In some circumstances introversion is a trait which is necessary for survival as it imbues caution and careful assessment of risk - in this case Pike swimming by and looking for a tasty meal.<br /><br />Various studies have been carried out which show that introverts engaged on creative work do a lot better if they are allowed to work on their own in peace and quiet rather than being forced to work in an open plan office. Yet the trend is for everyone to work in open plan offices. Some companies are gradually realising they need to provide both environments for their staff so that people who need peace and quiet to do their best work can find space to shut themselves away from the crowd.<br /><br />This book is well written and an interesting and lively read for anyone who is an introvert or who lives or works with introverts. I found it a fascinating and thought provoking read - most especially the chapter on bringing up naturally introverted children. I found myself wanting to stand up and scream `YES YES YES' at the top of my voice as I recognised myself in so many of the examples quoted. The extrovert ideal of the Western world is not the ideal in the East where courtesy, quiet behaviour and deference to other people are regarded as admirable qualities. Maybe I need to go and live in China or India to be valued.es to change as personality traits in Guppies seem to be inherited.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I actually first got to know \\"Viva la Vida\\" after buying the mini-album, \\"Prospekts March\\", which I found really nice. Especially songs like \\"Life in Technicolor II\\", \\"Glass of Water\\", \\"Rainy Day,\\" \\"Lost\\" and the fine acoustic final number \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground\\" were so strong that I also had to buy \\"Viva la Vida\\".<br /><br />I knew, of course, the delicate title song, and it turned out  that several numbers were repeats compared to \\"Prospekts March\\" - in different versions, though. \\"Life in Technicolor\\" is still a nice number, but I clearly prefer vocal version of \\"Prospekts March\\".<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" is obviously a stand-out, but otherwise favorites are \\"Cemetaries of London\\", \\"Yes\\" and \\"Strawberry Hill\\", which in varying degrees seem inspired by the Velvet Underground.<br /><br />The melodic \\"Reign of Love\\" which is tied together with \\"Lovers in Japan\\" is so such a strong song that I think it should have stood alone.<br /><br />Another great album from Coldplay

B005S9EJ14|3.0|This film is not the first to employ the plot device of a bunch of ill-matched strangers thrown together with their individual stories, who develop self-knowledge through interaction with each other in a new environment. The setting here is contemporary Jaipur and the characters are a bunch of fish-out-of-water Brits in their twilight years; a new twist on the old storyline. So what's `The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' like as a viewing experience?<br /><br />The answer is generally good, with minor reservations. The Brit A-list cast of autumn-years players is made, either by skilled make-up or even more skilled close-up camerawork, to look - well, so old, especially when contrasted to the youthful dynamism of some of the Indian cast. Is this supposed to be a not-so-subtle metaphor about these two nations and their current global profiles?<br /><br />The Rajasthan locations are brought to life by superb camerawork and editing and a great eye for detail. The film captures Jaipur to perfection, though of course you don't get the overpowering olfactory cocktail of cattle, incense and spices, perfumes, diesel fumes and industrial pollution of modern India on film, nor the searing >40C dry heat in the summer.<br /><br />At times TBEMH has the feel of a Mike Lee film, with his technique of allowing the actors to determine story development by their own real-life interactions in front of the camera. At other times it's obviously scripted; funny, poignant and touching and occasionally a bit heavy-handed. The characters rather predictably develop, learn and change as they interact with India and with each other: some adapt to their new home like ducks to water and with a sense of adventure; others don't fare so well, and some take time to eventually feel at home. A sub-plot between the young, enthusiastic and eternally optimistic hotel manager (Dev Patel) and his pretty moped-riding, call-centre-employed girlfriend (Tena Desai) is used to explore the struggle between the new India with self-assertive young professionals living by western values and the traditional controlling influence of their Indian families. Unfortunately the confrontational resolution of this conflict will be seen by some viewers as melodramatic and trite - actually it's positively toe-curling, and that's all I'm going to say.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film but short of excellent. See it for the veteran cast turning in some fine performances, a good-but-not-great script containing a few surprises amongst the clich&eacute;s (cricket playing street kids, Indian university graduates working in call-centres, the iniquities of the Hindu caste system) and some great one-liners: an overall feel-good and life-affirming viewing experience set in stunning Jaipur locations.ndia with self-assertive young professionals living by western values and the traditional controlling influence of their Indian families.

Has been a long time since I have re-read a book, but this will definitely be one.
B005URRCUY|3.0|I started listening to the Black Keys very early on.  I loved the rawness of the music.  But as with just about every band, the more popular they become, the more people and instruments are on the albums.  This dilutes the pureness of what I loved about their music in the beginning.  The same thing has happened to Kings of Leon and other bands.  I remember when Alicia Keys' first album came out and I loved her.  But by the time she became really famous, her beautiful voice is drowned out by all the back up voices and too many instruments.  KEEP IT SIMPLE, PLEASE
B002G1YPH0|5.0|In brief, the info I was interested in while shopping:  This cooler is very effective, very cheap, and very quiet when using the included fan.  It also comes with thermal paste, though I already had some arctic silver that I went ahead and used.  Everything you need is in this kit and works great.<br /><br />My only bone with it is the fact that when oriented the most effective way for me, it interfered with my ram (which have heat spreaders on them).  Compared with other aftermarket coolers this is not particularly problematic, but I would have preferred to have it the other way.  Excellent product and I recommend it.  It's worth it just for the quietness even for people who are not overclocking.

0307352145|5.0|This book was a justification for the 50%+ of us who have tried to be extroverts, but will never get it right!  It is affirming to those of us who are quiet by nature, and shows the consequences of trying to force all peoples into a glitz culture.  (The consequences may indeed prove to be fatal to our society.)  I bought a copy for each of my sons and now feel quite at ease, just being myself.  Highly recommend it for educators, Hollywood, and all marketing practicioners.  Hopefully this book will lead to fewer cheerleaders and more thinkers!!!
B004WX8HFG|3.0|I bought this items because I thought MAYBE it'd be the Ultimate Edition. Many of us fans who bought years 1-6 Ultimate Editions have been waiting for the last two movies to release as an Ultimate Edition. All that's been said is that they will release some time in 2012. I've been searching all around for any information, but no luck.<br /><br />I then see this product \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (Four-Disc Blu-ray Deluxe Edition)\\" I think maybe this is the edition I've been looking for! I go into the product details and see it says \\"Ultimate Edition.\\" I think to myself how Amazon has had some shoddy details on other products. They may list DTS HD Master Audio on blu rays as plain old DTS 5.1. They also sometimes list anime as English or Japanese only, but they're really dual audio. I go for it and buy it.<br /><br />I got the item today. It looks just like the regular Blu Ray copy, but it also comes with a DVD and Digital Copy. The four discs are the movie (blu ray), the movie (dvd), special features, and a bonus disc. And the special lenticular cover is glued onto a basic thick paper sleeve. I should also mention the sleeve had a bar code sticker stuck to it (from Amazon) which covered up the bar code on the blu ray box. The sticker tore apart when I tried to remove it, slightly tearing and leaving pieces of the sticker on the sleeve.<br /><br />Well, at least I have a copy of the deathly hallows on blu ray. I decided to buy part 2 for super cheap as well. I may just wait for the real ultimate editions to come out...whenever that may be.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I FOUND  THE BOOK INTERESTING AS I TRIED TO SEE ITS VALUE FOR TEENAGERS.  UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO BUY FROM A BOOKSTORE AS AMAZON NEVER DELIVERED IT INSPITE OF CHARGING ME FOR IT.  I GUESS IT WAS WORTH PAYING FOR IT TWICE AS IT DOES GET INTO THE TEENAGE MIND.
0345529057|5.0|I took out the first book to read, put it on my back bumper, and forgot it.  I went back later to find it, but no joy.  So, I bought the first book again to read.  Good thing I did, it is wonderful.  If you are watching the Television production of \\"game of thrones\\".  This series is very good, and clears up some mysteries as to why you find certain folk at certain places, and so forth in the TV show.  This set is neatly boxed as a group of the first four books.  It is unabridged, and each book is thick.  It reminds me of \\"War and Rememberance\\", as I was in the first book of that sereies, I looked at the book I was reading, and said, \\"I'm only halfway done with this book, and there is another just as big waiting for me.  What Joy.  This set has three more just as big as the first, Joy.
0439023513|5.0|American author Suzanne Collins has written a truly powerful, gripping series that kept me wanting more right up till the end of the final book. Once I began reading I found it impossible to put the book down until I had finished the last page. Mockingjay provides a moving and brilliant conclusion to the trilogy. It is rather violent and not for the squeamish, but if you've got this far in the series you already know that. A highly recommended read.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|such a great game. lots of action. lots of fun different types of weapons. dialogue is funny and helps to make the game a full story. has three pretty long acts included. wish there were more. tons of fun. really a great galaga style game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very cute game. Anyone that is letting the kids play should already have a passcode set on your kindle fire to prohibit them from charging to your account. It is not in the game it is in the settings for your fire.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Most everyone will agree that this series of books are well written and very addicting. I am surprised at the number of people that have a hard time figuring out how Kindle books are laid out. It will always open at page one of the story. Anything that was placed before page one you have to scroll back to. Overall I am VERY pleased with my purchase and look forward to many more.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Books one and two of the trilogy are truly fantastic. The third book is a disjointd amalgam of different genres. Sci-fi with some comic book archetypes, a few flashbacks to the movie \\"Saw\\", and oddly enough a depressing ending that seems to have been lifted from an early draft of \\"Crime and Punishment\\". I loved the first two books and the great characters the author brought to life--if it only had ended around page 100 of Mockingjay...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing these games when I'm relaxing. My daughter found it for her ipad, after playing it on my kindle fire. I like the fact that you get to open new games after you have reached your goal.
1401322425|5.0|Jamie Oliver is my favorite chef and this cookbook is why. I'm starting my own vegetable patch and its wonderful to have a cookbook with planting, care and prep of my favorite veggies. I actually have the BBC show on my DVR and read book along with the show. Very unique setup--making a cookbook to match show so completely. I wish more chefs would do that. A must have if fan of Jamie Oliver.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is so easy and efficient to use it is amazing. Even when in church where there is hardly wifi the downloaded works great.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i really like this game.i will tell all my friends about this game. maybe we can start a game against each other.
B007CKNX28|1.0|I love Jack White's guitar playing. But there's almost none of it here. He frontloads Sixteen Saltines and another track. Blunderbuss is pretty much downhill from there--track after hookless track of tinkling piano and overstuffed lyrics.<br /><br />If you like guitar rock, stay away from this one.<br /><br />Blunderbuss would fit in perfectly on Garrison Keillor's radio show. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
0545265355|1.0|My girlfriend and I spontaneously went and saw the movie adaptation for the first book on a date. She was adamant that we purchase the books afterwards. We did, and as I am a fast reader, I had the first book read in roughly a day. No problems there-- the first book is a complete story, well worded and concise. But from there it goes downhill. The second book is a clumsy attempt to involve a subplot, which comes off as a fanfic tack-on. That being said, I still wasn't that turned off by the second book. I was in for a rude awakening with the third book, though. Collins tries (and fails) to incorporate a gargantuan story into thinly worded conversation that is the equivalent of listening to a concerto composed by a Rhesus monkey. The last 70 pages or so in particular contain some of the worst prose imaginable, tied together with one of the most amateur, poorly thought out plots I've ever seen. If I could return this set to the author, I would. Terrible.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|If you like Mark Wahlberg, you will love this movie. If you rent it on Amazon, you don't have to worry about smuggling your own candy into the theater.
B007CKNX28|4.0|I suppose I'll start out by stating the glaringly obvious: if you are a fan of Jack White then there is very little chance that you won't love this album. As a fan of the White Stripes for many years I found Jack White's side ventures with The Raconteurs and The Dead Weather to be hit or miss. With that said, I wasn't sure what to expect with his first solo album.<br /><br />Truly, this is White's best work since 2003's Elephant.<br /><br />The album is as stylistically diverse as it is ambitious. From the piano-driven, minimalist \\"Love Interruption\\" to the jazzy \\"I Guess I Should Go to Sleep.\\" Hailing from Detroit but currently based in Nashville, the rock and country roots are present on nearly every track. The majority of the songs deal with the ever popular \\"love-gone-wrong\\" theme - but that's not necessarily a bad thing. White's lyrics are honest and raw as he moves from anger to remorse and then back again. It's hard not to relate.
0545265355|5.0|I am definitely a book nerd but I was a little hesitant to read the Hunger Games even though I had already heard a lot of great things about the series.  I hate reading or doing something just because everyone else is but I gave in anyway.  I'm glad I did.  This series kept my attention and I couldn't put the book down, which is probably why I read all three books within a week.  Great read but it was way too fast!
B007U8U1V8|2.0|If you are a fan of the White Stripes just purchase the first 3 songs of this album (they are really rockin out songs and Jack pulls off a nice guitar solo on Freedom21)and save your money because the rest of this album is a disapointment for some reason Jack now thinks he is some kind of soft rock piano player I'm shaking more like I'm bored of this lame album
B00005OWIU|3.0|While the recording quality is excellent, if your looking for the movie soundtrack; THIS IS NOT IT!<br /><br />Although I was expecting an expansion on the original movie soundtrack, I thought the selections would at least have passages that duplicated the corresponding passages of the movie; especially as it's advertised as the \\"Movie Soundtrack\\". I was particularly disappointed in the \\"Diagon Alley and The Gringotts Vault\\" track. If you remember from the movie Hagrid says \\"Welcome Harry, to Diagon Alley\\" and the grand entrance theme heralds the start of the magical adventure; you won't hear that grand entrance theme on this CD. Nor will you hear the similar theme played during the \\"Entry into the Great Hall and The Banquet\\".  It would seem that John Williams, for all his brilliance has forgotten his original arrangements.<br /><br />Again the CD is well recorded and orchestrated, but a movie soundtrack it's not!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read all three books, couldn't stop after just one! Great read, lots of fun.  If you are tired of the same 'ol plots, get into this trilogy, and buckle up for a great ride!
B0051BVQFG|5.0|I spent 20 years in the military and I was very impressed by the accuracy of stress under combat. It showed how Marines evolve during the battle to engadge ET. Very realstic interactions between the squad members. The reason why this received poor reviews is because you have couch potatoes making reviews on this movie. Less than 3% of the population will serve in the military. So armchair warriors watch and learn how to never give up, which is the military mindset. This was a kick ass realistic movie barring the aliens.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The marketing of this book has overpromised and underdelivered. What I got was a poorly written novel with a very loose plot. I felt no emotional connection to or between the characters. Both the vocabulary and even the sex became monotonous (that's a sad commentary). The same words are used over and over and over again....and they're not very sexy words at that. I don't know any woman except my Grandma who refers to her vagina as \\"down there\\". The Red Room of Pain has nothing on the pain of reading this book.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I can listen to the whole cd over and over again and it never gets old! Love Katy Perry and her music, she is an icon.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|This is a great idea for an app. Maybe someday someone will write one that works. If that happens, I'll likely buy it.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|how many people lost the game looking at the screen shots? also since google docs i dont understand paying for any of these suites
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|The song \\"Somebody I Used to Know\\" is getting played all over the airways and the video is fantastic. The DJs said the CD was awesome. I usually have a rule about knowing 2-3 songs off a CD before purchasing it, but I made an exception for this one. I'm really trying to like this CD, but none of the other songs sound like \\"Somebody I Used to Know\\". I'm a little disappointed in this purchase.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Horrible controls makes the games too frustrating to play. Had to drag entire screen just to move a twitch.  NOT suitable<br />for Fire
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Just received my Cosmonaut, and have been testing it out on my iPad.  Hands down the best stylus I have used.  You might think because of it's thickness that it would not be comfortable in your hand - wrong!  Feels very well balanced and is easy to write with.  Tested it in both my Penultimate and SketchbookPro Apps and could not be more pleased with this Stylus.  Well constructed product, looks like it is built to last.  Product was shipped and received in the time indicated.  On a less important note,  even the packaging is cool!  And, important to me...it is  designed and manufactured in America!  A+ Highly recommend.
B004ZNANZA|5.0|\\"The Wall\\" by Pink Floyd always was a great sounding album. I must have worn out my old CD cause I always had it on. Now comes the newly remastered edition and it sounds awesome. I'm not one to nit-pick about details, but it sounds great and you really get a feel of the sounds and all the little sound effects that Pink Floyd is good at. It sounds crisp and loud but you still hear every background sound and music too. As with the other remasters of their albums, this one is great, also one of my faves too. Certainly worth it, even for the price, and Amazon definitely has a great deal. If you love Pink Floyd, this is one of their best albums, songs like Another Brick in the Wall, Mother, Comfortably Numb, Run Like Hell and Hey You are just great to hear.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|yes! I can finally play this game with my friends. I can't draw but it's all good fun. thx omgpop.
B007Q476KU|4.0|I can see how this would become a classic like Iron Will and the Black Stallion. The story did not go how I expected which was a nice surprise and loved the ending! The cinematography was phenomenal!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea what this was going to be about. I know the movie was coming out and all my friends loved the series. I took a chance and couldnt have asked for better!! This crazy story is beyond great, I couldnt have asked for a better read!
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I liked this one much better than the first one - see my review here  - though I'm still a little skeptical on how it could work and how it would have ever come to be.  This time around it seemed more like it was just the \\"bad\\" people versus the \\"good\\" people so I was able to put my skepticism aside. It was a quick read and I was really engrossed in the story. I'm not sure how much I liked going back and forth between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\", but it does leave a sense of anxiety that you might not have had if it was just set out chronologically. The ending isn't a big surprise either. However, I did enjoy the book and I look forward to installment #3 whenever it comes out!<br /><br />Recommended to fans of YA books.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book in the '80s when it was first published. As my children grew, I introduced them to this book. Both my sons read it while in middle school. My daughter read it a few years later. All three are now in their twenties and all three still love this book. My daughter has read every book in the collection and especially loved the books told from the perspective of Bean, a secondary character in Ender's Game. My sons have read all the sequels, including my younger son who does not always enjoy reading.<br /><br />The book feels as current today as it did then. The characters are completely engrossing, even though they are presented as children in this first book. The experiences they have as children define them and define their lives. I have re-read this book over and over again. It is on my shelf as one of my favorite books of all time, along with Dune, anything by Jane Austen, Lord of the Rings, and others.
0345803485|1.0|Fell for the pr hype on this one -- and boy was there hype from Dr Drew to Good Morning America-- the author has a great publicity team behind her. Poorly written, shallow, no character development, plot you have heard before, even the sex was so dull.<br />I think it actually took half the novel to get to the uninteresting Mr. Grey's \\"sexual appetite\\". How about that first night they spent together and didnt have sex because as Mr Grey states, \\"Anastasia, you were comatose. ..I like my women sentient and receptive.\\" Dont bother to get this one the film rated PG13 with those Twilight stars in the leads will be out soon enough.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I loved the action all the way through! The cool tools, really tough Woman agent, moments that made me go \\"Whoa!\\", comedic side kick, great cinematography... I thought it was very under advertised also!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting all my trends have this game and they all love it . jalah
1451627289|5.0|Interesting. Most of the negativity about this book involves its length. I understand that we have become use to \\"tweets\\" and music videos and flash fiction, but when a master storyteller like King sends something our way, I want it to last. The joy is in the trip, folks. Enjoy each and every word.
0140288503|5.0|It's my firm opinion that if you made every single American read both Black Hawk Down and Generation Kill, you would have a populace that's far more understanding of our military, and one that was much closer to the reality than the hyperbolic extremes of \\"ultra-patriotic America defenders\\" or \\"baby-killing murderers\\". While Generation Kill focuses on the soldiers themselves, Black Hawk Down focuses (as its subtitle suggests) on war itself, on both a macro and micro level. Bowden's subject is the Battle of Mogadishu, in which a daytime raid that was supposed to be an in-and-out subject capture mission became a massive siege in which multiple American helicopters were shot down and the soldiers were forced to defend themselves against a city literally full of attackers. The battle itself was chaos (to put it mildly), and Bowden manages the difficult task of conveying that chaos while still keeping numerous threads of action clear in the reader's head. More than that, Bowden ably switches between the battle as viewed through the eyes of those who fought it and the battle as seen on a wider scope, and through that switching, he conveys exactly how little things can spiral out of control in a battle scenario. Black Hawk Down is a harrowing read, and rightfully so; here is a situation where a relatively small fighting force struggles against an entire city that rallies against them, and Bowden perfectly immerses the reader in that terrifying situation. At the same time, he often switches to the Somali perspective, a choice that both widens the book's perspective as well as helping the reader to understand many of the reasons the battle escalated as much as it did. Black Hawk Down earns its secondary title well; here is a book about how technology has changed the face of war, and how American domination often can be its own worst enemy. It's also a book about those who fight our wars and what kind of people they are, as well as the ways in which even the tiniest mistake in a battle can change everything. It's a harrowing, riveting book, one that both condemns and praises the military, taking an even-handed look at the battle and trying to understand how things got to where they did. it avoids easy answers, refuses to pass judgment, and merely documents; yet, for all that, there's no way to walk away from the book and not have your opinion shaped and your beliefs changed. A superb book that should be required for any American, period.n a battle can change everything.

B007RFJ4QM|1.0|I could not believe that 2 major actors of their caliber were in this B-rated at best movie! The story line sucked and had parts that were not probable. I was aggravated and disappointed that I spent money to even rent this because I expected so much more!
0345803485|5.0|I devoured this book in 3 nights. The second in 2. The third I spaced over a week just because I knew it was about to end. I haven't been this excited about a book since the last Harry Potter came out. A definite must read.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|finally!!!!!!!!! I have been waiting so long for this!!!! now can we get temple run??!! lets request it!! all in tabor of getting temple run for our kindle fires say aye!!
B006SV2LWA|1.0|Oh man, brutally bad movie.  Acting wasn't bad, but story was like watching a History Channel documentary on this is what happens when a serious virus attacks.  Ending was the only part I liked.
B007JUWM64|5.0|I loved this movie! The Three Musketeers has been done over and over so I didn't expect to see anything different but there was many cool, innovative action sequences! I hope they make a sequel!!
0307120007|5.0|I purchased this book for my 2 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loved it. The ability to feel the book as well as see the drawings and hear the words really made this special. Now if there were only a way to work in the other two senses...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it's fun. its nice you dont have to have neighbors to advance in the game. I am enjoying it. kills time.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|A very interesting and unusual movie. Fast-paced and one twist after another, definitely worth watching! The ending was slightly disappointing, but other than that was pleased.
B007Q2N0HA|3.0|I don't have to tell you how many comparisons that could be made between the two stories...I feel kinda ripped off, but at least this one was cheaper :-)  Overall a good story, but honestly I was able to put it down.  I was not able to put down Fifty Shades. Granted this heroine was overall much more mature, just too many story similarities. Just like Fifty Shades, you don't know the background / issues of the hero till book 2.  Decent reeading for the $$$.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this app is completely awesome! but everybody that's saying they need to add temple run: this is not the place to say that, you need to tell them that in the help and feedback area in the kindle fire.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and interesting. It is easy to get hooked. The only bad thing is it is very easy to run out of energy.
0470474874|4.0|The book is very thorough on the topic. I recommend actually following along with your excel program while reading the book because you will learn the material more effectively. At times, there were some parts where I was lost on how to actually do things but eventually I figured it out.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am absolutely thrilled to finally have draw something for my kindle fire! works well and am very excited. I just got it this morning and have been waiting months for it to come out!!! works perfectly on my fire and am super happy to have a big screen to draw on!(:
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I haven't had any problem. and like a lot of games, you have to sign out by going into &quot;stuff&quot; on the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is a fabulous book for a fabulous price. cant go wrong! Thanks Amazon, hope more people read these old classic stories.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun for when you are just sitting and waiting. a lot of ads kind of distracting and irritating for a free game definitely worth the money
B007VGXS8M|3.0|its not the game ti play all the time its kind of boring to play for say 4 or 5 minute u no what it frigen sucks f it
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|This season is one of the best!!  I do not normally watch an entire season of ANY show twice but I did with this season!  Excellent writing and acting!!
B001EO748M|5.0|Excellent condition and quick delivery!  The Tudors is a fantastic series and a fun way to learn history with a lot of action and good looking characters :)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like most other reviewers, I became addicted to playing until all the timers reset to impossible amounts of time! this left nothing for me to do in the game.  Going to uninstall right now. waste of space on my Kindle Fire!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUT IT GETS CHALLINGING.  I FINISHED THE WHOLE GAME I HAD TO SHUT IT OFF ONE TIME I GOT P.OD AT IT
1442419814|4.0|This is a pretty standard trilogy of a Young adult novel - young girl in a not-so-near post-apocalyptic future, thrust into the middle of a struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\", in love with boy A in first novel, in love with boy B in second, and choosing between the two in the third. That said, I still couldn't put any of the books down until I was done with them. A nice variation on our possible future and a pretty original \\"end of the world\\" scenario. I enjoyed all three books and recommend them if you liked the Hunger Games.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun game I recommend it to anyone who likes games that take time and you get new objectives! very fun!
B004P98QZ8|4.0|My kids really like this one, it was challenging, fun on the same time not over complicated  - all in all recommended, the final product is also very nice<br /><br />Eran.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very accurate and easy to navigate. I prefer this one because it is straight forward and doesn't have tons of advertisements.

B005DJ7U5G|4.0|I bought this product as a used DVD from a dealer.  There was a small scratch. I watched it on my Blu-Ray.  The DVD was upscaled and there was no slipping or damage.  It was an awesome find.<br /><br />The story itself is very good.  Much like Bryan Singer, Director of X=Men and X2 stated after the wide critical acclaim of X2 stated, \\"X2 is the movie I really wanted to make, but I had to make X-men first so that the second one would make sense.\\"  The same is true here. Actually, with HULK, CAPTAIN AMERICA, IRON MAN, and now THOR we have entire movies of backstory for these heroes for the coming movie AVENGERS.<br /><br />Thor is great.  We learn of his home, why he comes to earth. Yada yada.  Typical hero story, loses powers, regains them, kicks ass, special effects blow your mind.  It is totally worth a watch before the AVENGERS movie this may.  A used widescreen copy on DVD watched on a blu-ray is just fine and very cost conscience.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting forever to get this on my kindle. So much better than Sketch with Friends. There is no limit to how many games you can play. You earn coins to purchase color packs and bombs. You can play with friends or random people. The list goes on and on to why I love this app.
0788859544|5.0|This movie never gets old! I bought it for my 3 year old who had never seen it. We watched 4 times the first day it arrived. I LOVE all things Disney!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I purchased the Hunger Games along with other titles for my Kindle. Amazon makes it so easy to maneuver the website and helps make my purchases fast and accurate!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. If you like to be creative it would be great for you. Of course like any game it can be easy to get stuck. I found the hint function very useful. I had so much fun with it. I thought it was clever and it never bored me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very relaxing.  Each level brings new challenges that really make you think.  The graphics are nice and the music adds a nice touch.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I absolutely love this app. just for kindle fire users make sure you have a good battery somtimez it freezes up. make sure its charged but waaaaaaaayyyyyy to cooooooool!!!!
B003UESJ9M|1.0|Country Strong has earned its place amongst America's worst films.  Seriously, when this film had the opportunity to take viewers on a country music hayride; someone, presumably the director, elected to make it as depressing as possible.  The other problem is that for some reason that is lost to me as a movie viewer, Gwyneth Paltrow chooses to take on the most depressing characters there are.  After watching so many of these kinds of films starring Paltrow, I had, because of the title Country STRONG, thought, hey, maybe this one is different; unfortunately not.  Paltrow's character never conveys to the audience a sense of what is so bad that she cannot overcome it; and at the point when you think the script is going to move in the right direction, it turns out to be the biggest let down.  Here's hoping that Paltrow takes on some projects that allow her to be a brighter and happier character, because at this point I am beginning to think she takes these roles because they require no acting effort on her part; and that is worrisome.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Thiis was a good, light read. Since I'm an avid dog lover, Zues added a lot to the story. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
0307887960|4.0|Pierre Dukan, &lt;strong>The Dukan Diet&lt;/strong> (Crown, 2000)<br /><br />Not a great deal here you haven't read before, but like most modified-Atkins plans, it's got some interesting ideas, focuses more on exercise than Atkins does, and looks at a more realistic long-term solution. May be difficult for some Americans to adapt to the exercise portion (in most of the office buildings where I've worked for the past couple of decades, the fire stairs, which would be necessary for Dukan's exercise concepts, are sealed unless there's an actual fire/fire drill going on), but that can be worked around. Worth checking out if you like the low-carb idea but have always been a little put off by the Atkins \\"everything goes better with bacon\\" attitude. Though be warned, Dukan's attitude is \\"everything goes better with oat bran.\\" *** ½

B000L212HW|1.0|this film was badly acted, macho growl after growl. the dragons were ridiculous not to mention a sci fi plot so contrived, it was incredible from<br />the set-up of the plot(?)to the...well, i have to admit we couldn't get thru it. it's one of those all dark foggy gray films that are becoming more prevalent from hollywood. if you must see it, don't bother with the blu ray medium---it has absolutely no depth-of-field visually or in any other way. it cost me plenty of blu ray $$$ and it was so bad, none of my gathered friends wanted it when i offered it to them for nothing. i don't want it in my extensive collection of fine films. library donation here i come, tho' i'm hesitant to pass to some unsuspecting library card holder!
0062101897|5.0|I've been eyeing this book for months at a local chain bookstore.  It's big, thick, and heavy.  When it arrived, I thought they had shipped me 3 bricks.  Either way, it was about 50% more expensive locally, so I got it on Amazon.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it's quite wonderful.  The first 5-10 pages, before the copyright pages, are full-color, glossy, pictures of the cast and characters from the movies.  The title page folds out to a large picture of the main characters of the series.<br /><br />The book is a mix between a coffee table book with its amazing pictures and quick facts, and a serious look into the work and creativity that goes into creating a fantasy world for a major movie series.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the series, having grown up with the books and movies, but I got the book for my girlfriend.  She has barely put it down over the past few days, and she's only gotten about 1/5th of the way into the book.  She's quite a quick reader, but she keeps stopping on every page to study the numerous pictures.  She keeps interrupting my studying to tell me cool facts and anecdotes from the book.  Every time I look over, she's learning about a new subject of movie making (so far I've seen Quidditch, the underwater lake scenes from GoF, \\"Lifecasts\\" (life-like stand-ins for dangerous scenes, petrified people, etc), Umbridge's kitten plates, Yule Ball fashion.  Each has a page, or more, talking about the intricacies of the subject for the movie.<br /><br />If you know someone who is a major fan of the Harry Potter series, and has an appreciation for theater, costuming, set design, movie 'magic', photography, or CGI, I'd say that's it's hard to go wrong by getting them this as a gift.  I think that it's an incredible book, and my girlfriend has an even higher opinion of it.  My only problem is I don't know how I'll be able to top it for her birthday...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have tried a number of true free card apps since I got my kindle and this one is one of the best.  It is simple and has great options for how you want it to look and feel.  If you're looking for a good solitaire, you will find it in this one.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A nice little diversion for people who like puzzle games. Good for wasting a couple minutes or a couple hours.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is the funniest game ever. stupid menu though.  hard to get out of the game without turning off the Android device
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is very fun. It reminds me of playing video games when I was a kid in the '80's.
B001O1O71C|3.0|It's a nice book which I enjoyed reading.<br />Very well written, from the point of view of 9-year-old Bruno.<br /><br />But somehow I find it hard to believe that a 9 year old boy, son of a highly placed Nazi soldier, is totally oblivious to the war and to the hatred of Nazi Germans to the jews back then.<br />When they move to 'Out-With' Bruno is tutored by a man who obviously is into the Aryan-pure race thing and I can imagine that that man would have indoctrinated the children into also hating jews. I doubt that kid could have been so naive, and actually befriend a jewish boy.<br /><br />It was also a bit weird that a 9 year old didn't know what Führer means or who the Führer is. Honestly, the boy didn't recognize Hitler??<br /><br />And its also a bit hard to believe that Schmuel would be willing to befriend the son of the man who is causing them so much pain.<br /><br />I know the author was trying to show how how pure and innocent kids can be. But somehow, they were just portrayed as naive and a bit stupid.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I use this mainly for hiking and camping. I do not usually do heavy duty work nor use this constantly when I am outdoors.

B007IX383I|5.0|At first listen, Weather Systems confused me. I did not enjoy the record, I found one or two songs I liked and that was it.<br /><br />But one day it clicked, every track on this record is amazing, I actually view it as one long piece. This album flows as one track, not as 9 different tracks.<br /><br />It's a very emotional album, and I find that emotional music is the most beautiful music.<br /><br />There is a wide variety of musical journeys on this record, acoustic guitars, bright sounds, fast rhythms, mesmerizing strings, electronica, harmonies; the list goes on and it's amazing just how well it truly does flow together.<br /><br />Weather Systems does not surpass its predecessor (We're Here Because We're Here), but it sure does come close and is without a doubt a worthy follow-up that stands on it's own.<br /><br />This is an amazing album that everyone should at least experience once.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|timers went all crazy 258 hours to wait for anything! after a few days of playing it went all crazy. before that it was fun if they can't fix this then don't even bother playing

B007SYWFRM|5.0|its so fun to play. its adicting I loved all the ice age movies and this shows all the animals in the movies. its the best game ever
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This is a great flick if you are a Depp fan and want to see him out of the box.  It definately has some dark humor, but it also has some surprisingly good music ability and humor (again, in a dark sense).  On his artsy side, a great flick in my opinion.  Not your run of the mill action movie.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|it is awful! I am refuse to give it back! your food spoils! your custimers only give you 2 tips!
B00005YUPO|2.0|This DVD is only 30 minutes....not 172 minutes!  Overall a very great DVD.  My 5 month old loves it.  Was just disappointed as I wanted something a little longer for my car DVD player.
B000FC1HQY|4.0|Excellent writing---entertaining and full of good solid information. If you have ever  been curious about the nitty-gritty of mid- 20th century colonialism, this is a good way to discover what the reality was for the people who lived it.
B002SSBD6W|2.0|There is some good information in this book, unfortunately in order to get to it you have to wade through mountains of biased, self righteous paraphrasing, interpretations, and anecdotes.  There are even some things that seemed flat out innacurate - not the facts about the industry or the way the animals are treated, he does a decent job of getting those things right.  It's the times he tries to put on his anthropologist hat that drives me up a wall!  He spent the better part of a chapter talking about how if we ignore the similarities between humans and fish, that we're ignoring the most important part of our humanity...it's just my opinion but I always thought the most important part of our humanity was our personalities and the choices we make...not the fact that we both have spines and pain receptors - you're streching it my friend.  He also starts out the book saying it's not a call to vegetarianism, and later on admits that it actually is just that.<br /><br />To sum up I think he should stick to writing novels...Fast Food Nation provides a lot of the same information with little to no bias leaving you free to draw your own conclusions.
B004LWZW4M|2.0|\\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" isn't a bad movie, it just isn't a very good or original one.<br /><br />Plenty of stock characters.  In fact, ALL of the human characters in this movie are stock characters.  If you've seen a fair number of genre films or techno-thrillers you've already seen this movie before.  ROTPOTA borrows heavily from cliches and tropes we've seen before, which is not in itself inexcusable.  But it doesn't do anything that original with them either.<br /><br />I read and heard a lot of reviews that said this film was better than it was expected to be and actually pretty good.  Well either those reviews were cherry-picked or the reviewers themselves are babes in the woods and don't know enough about contemporary cinema history to know a copycat scene when they see one.<br /><br />At the risk of making a bad pun, this film's major drawback is that it apes other, better films (and some lesser ones too).<br /><br />The film runs about 2 hours but after the first 80 minutes I thought three hours had gone by.  It drags in the first two acts.<br /><br />The apes escape their enclosures and run amok in the third act through a Hollywood version of San Francisco where there are seemingly only a handful of citizens and maybe 20 cops, not to mention the monkeys get around that unfamiliar-to-them town quicker and faster than a seasoned tour guide can with a map and a teleporter.  By the time they get to the Golden Gate Bridge -- a landmark that apparently is required BY LAW to be featured prominently in any type of thriller set in San Francisco -- the movie sinks even further into \\"been there/done that\\" trope-ville.<br /><br />I was greatly disappointed by this movie.  I can't recommend it for anyone older than 13 years old.
0345803485|2.0|While I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of literary critics, nor attack the author for her egocentric position while dealing for the movie rights, I need to point out that this is an attempt at Story of O, by a Harlequin romance write, and she falls shorts on both counts. I never thought I would ever find a category called \\"cute S&M\\", but this is about it.
0439023513|2.0|The first one was good, second okay-this is bad! Second did not impress me, but had to see how it all ended. Guess I dislike it because I don't buy the plot idea; how did Katniss get so important for this revolution? A symbol-just one small girl?? Also, really disappointed with the end. In the three books, Katniss hesitates between Gale and Peeta. I had expected a scene, at least one, all three present, detailing her final choice. Not just a paragraph with her reasoning whom she needs the most.  Also, Katniss mental problems get in the way. Ok, she killed, she was in the arena-but does she have to be this out? It is strange, in such a bright future, they don't have anything to remedy shock and hurt. Nowadays, we have... Well, I guess it comes to the main themes of the books; war is horrible, killing is worse. It made sense when they said Suzanne Collins had been interested in World War three.<br /><br />So, I recommend: read book 1, leave the other two. Suzanne wrote one each year, the last two seem to be written in a hurry.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've been waiting for this to become available on Kindle Fire, and I wasn't disappointed!!  So much easier to draw than iPhone.  Highly recommend this app!

B0039TD7PY|5.0|Pure musical indulgence by the beloved singer/song writer duo of Taylor and King.  Just finished Carole King's great book (plug) and this was like a cherry on top.  Lots of tasty album notes which I always enjoy.  Both artists are so gracious and both are smooth whether introducing numbers or performing them.  What a pristine live concert -- who needs the studio when the first take sounds so perfect.  Great balance between the \\"standard\\" arrangement and improv by the artist.  Honestly, I was near tears of emotion listening to these classic charts performed by the orginal artists.  Taylor and King are truly cut from the same cloth with the same tempermant; complimenting each others style glove-tight.  They seem like long lost siblings.  James always cracks me up with his dry, unstated humor.  Thank you for so graciously sharing your art with your faithful fans.  DVD is a real plus to see as it happened!  Someone had panned the production work (audio) and I'm sorry it sounds just perfect to 99% of our ears.  FIVE STARS!!
0439023521|4.0|This one is good, a tight story, few loose ends. I believe in the idea, how they force young people to participate. The end is good too. Missing a bit on the depth of the characters. Some parts, like the ones on the stinger jackers, are a bit too brutal. Well, for being a massacre, it could have been worse.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Reading some of the reviews on here I can see where people might get a bad taste about how this show is potrayed. Yes, there are a lot of sex scenes/nude scenes in this series. If you aren't mature enough to handle it, I don't recommend this show for you. However, if you are a fan of the book series and/or understand how the sex scenes play into the storyline then you will not be dissapointed. There is so much going on I find it hard to believe that people focus on such a small factor. The actors are very talented and do an outstanding job in potraying their characters. The tv show stays pretty true to the books since the author has a hand in the production. People have to understand that a novel has to be adapted into a screen play and that means some things have to change in order to seem accurate on the screen. A book has plenty of time to set the scene and develop the emotions while tv does not. Some scenes must change so the audience can keep up and understand the storyline like they are supposed to without 800 pages to help them.

B000006UNF|5.0|Script for a Jesters Tear is a great album for many reasons but the crazed genius of Fish is what makes Marillion, until his departure, like no other band. His lyrics are great, the music is fantastic and its such an imaginative approach to music. I have loved Marillion since about 1986 and still listen to them all the time. It was a tragedy that Fish left as post-Fish they have become a pleasant, but to my mind, very average band. Listen to the first album by the original band.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|The first problem that I had with the game was figuring out how to exit the game.  You have to go to the options in order to get the home symbol to show up so that you can exit the game. The other problem I have with the game is not being able to invite friends so I have no neighbors so can't complete the quests involving neighbors.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|the game is fun but is seems to run a little bit slow at times. also it seems like I can never exit the game when I want to.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This season was the best of Breaking Bad by far. And I never had any issues streaming on Amazon .
0307592731|2.0|I think this was actually a 2.5 for me. Like many readers of this book, I'm a huge Dear Sugar fan. As a result, I had pretty high expectations. Sadly, Wild did not live up to them. I felt like the book was largely lacking the beauty and power of the Sugar columns, and as an avid backpacker, I was utterly horrified by Strayed's total lack of preparedness to be on the PCT -- she didn't have the right gear OR the right knowledge to keep herself healthy and safe, and her survival without severe injuries or even death is more luck than anything else. It frightens me to think that others might take her behavior as an example. And then there's her complete disregard for Leave No Trace hiking ethics. Camping in the middle of the trail? Pooping right on the side of the trail and then just covering it with rocks because she was too lazy to dig a proper hole? Throwing her boot into the woods? I hope that Strayed has either learned better hiking ethics or stays the hell off the trails -- I'd like the Sierras to stay relatively pristine and untouched, thank you very much! I listened to this book on tape on my commute, but if I'd been reading it in my limited free time, I probably would have bailed before the end. There were occasional moments when I could relate to Strayed, but mostly I found her to be self-indulgent. Her behavior was just too willfully ignorant for me to feel much sympathy for her.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|remember Oregon trail from my younger days....I also remember that it was free! you have to spend way too much money but its fun.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Big Time Rush has come so far since their first album and what makes this album so much more personal is that each of the guys co-wrote 9 songs on the album. I'm not ashamed to admit I'm in my 20's and truly enjoy their music and think they are great role models for kids to look up to. They're such nice and funny guys and really work hard for all their success. This may have started out as a show they auditioned for but it's quickly growing into their own band that they put their heart and soul into.<br /><br />Tracks:<br /><br />Music Sounds Better With You- First single and really catchy song. Great choice as their first single since it's so different from the stuff on their first album and it just sounds so radio friendly.<br /><br />Show Me- As a 21+ fan, this song is sexy. The dance moves they do when they perform it live makes it that much more fun.<br /><br />All Over Again- Possibly my favorite track, though I don't dislike any of them.<br /><br />No Idea- Yes All Time Low wrote this song and YES they are given credit on the album. But these are two different songs and the guys' voices sound so good on this song, it quickly became one of my favorites.<br /><br />Cover Girl- Kendall Schmidt is a perfect human being for writing this song. Yes it's a little cheesy but it hits you right where it hurts and you can't help but smile when listening to this song. \\"It's what's underneath you skin, the beauty that shines within\\"<br /><br />Love Me Love Me- the best dance track. So different from anything they've done and I challenge anyone to stay in their seat.<br /><br />If I Ruled the World- Since it was used in the show before the album came out, a lot of fans already loved this song and it fits in well on this album.<br /><br />Time of Our Life- Another fun track perfect for the summer.<br /><br />Superstar- I think this is the most 'pop' song on the album with a catchy hook and was also used on the show in Season 2.<br /><br />You're Not Alone- What every girl wants to hear- the guy always being there for you.<br /><br />Elevate- 'Elevate a little higha, throw a party in the sky and demonstrate' Love this song and I could hear it in a club and on the radio.
159562015X|5.0|The StrengthsFinder assessment is a tool that I used to help recognize traits that I may not have already seen in myself.  The book itself is an explanation of the test and the personality traits that describe who we are and what we offer to the world.  The results are the 5 top traits that \\"fit\\" you.  This is the second time I've taken the assessment.  The first time was about 6 years ago as part of my MBA coursework.  I wanted to see how much, if at all, my results would changed.  My top trait remained the same, and 3 others just traded places, while one trait dropped out for a new one.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable and the results are clearly explained.  I'd recommend StrengthsFinder for anyone who is looking to maximize their potential and/or looking for a change in their career.  The first time, some of the revelations were expected, while others were surprising.  Getting similar results the second time showed me that the method is legitimate.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|The conceit of a bird who can't fly (I mean other than an ostrich or penguin or some such bird that really can't fly) and his misadventures that led him to learn how to fly was a good starting point for a kid's movie.  Talking animals: check.  A romantic interest: check.  An exotic location: check.  Bright, lavish colors and some songs: check.  A cast of quirky supporting characters: check.  So how did Rio manage to fly a bit lower than it looked like it should have done on paper?  I'd go back to the characters.  Blu is likable and a bit neurotic out of his element and works alright as the lead character but the rest of the cast falls a little flat.  Blu's partner/ owner, Linda, is gentle and caring and not much else.  Blu's love interest, Jewel, doesn't have much going on other than she's mean and yearns to be free.  The bird doctor is daffy but, along with the other human representations of Rio de Janeiro's citizenry, could come off as a little offensive (don't believe me? go back and look at all of the main human characters who are Brazilian: you have the cooky bird guy and his inept, too-tight spandex wearing security officer; you have the thieving thugs, both mean and dim-witted; you have the orphan boy who, though sympathetic, is a thief).  I'm sure that kids won't take it this way and they will find some humor in these characters and that they're all cartoonish, i.e., exagerrated but still...I'm just saying.  As for the other animals: did anyone else find the tweety bird and woodpecker annoying? George Lopez's (a gifted comedian) character is played straight and isn't very interesting other than to look at; the drooling bulldog...was hard to watch as that slobber was just too real.  Perhaps the only other character that was better developed than most was Nigel, the evil cockatoo (how can cockatoo be evil? they are some sweet birds!).  He was a good villain, but ugly.<br /><br />My final thought is that you could do a lot worse than Rio, but you can also do a lot better.lot better.

1469984202|5.0|I'm not a huge reader of Sci-Fi, generally don't care for dystopian settings.  However, I would seriously, enthusiastically recommend the Wool Omnibus to anyone who enjoys a ripping yarn, well told. I got hooked by taking a peek in the \\"Look Inside\\" feature and wound up buying the Kindle edition. I loved the fact that gender roles were beautifully, believably balanced. In addition to a wonderfully creative mind, the author has a clean, compelling style of writing.<br />This genuinely was one of those \\"stay-up-all-night-to-finish-it\\" books.<br /><br />My compliments to the author and a wish for much more of his writing to come.

B000XA5K48|5.0|***Brief Review***<br /><br />This film is not obviously not for those in the mood to think.  It's HEAVY on the action and light on just about everything else.  Actor and Actress wise it's actually good.  Monica Belluci is a great actress, and although this film is not a BRIGHT spot in her career, she still is not terrible in her performance.<br /><br />Clive in this film is a pistal expert...that's an understatement.  The man makes shots that only could be matched by Golgo 13 in their impossibleness.<br /><br />Story.  There is none.  Something about a baby, it's organs...or something.<br /><br />This is a leave your thinking cap at the door film.  Sometimes we guys need those kind of movies.  Will your girlfriend like this?  What do you think.<br /><br />Is it odd at times.  The part where Monica is in the...house of ill repute with that guy...was kind of wierd.  Also one thing that kept stabbing me while watching this film, Clive Owen must have stunk.  He nevers showers, lives in an abandoned factory with rats and wears rags for clothes.  Just a thought I wanted to share.<br /><br />Should you pay a fortune for this movie.  No, in fact you probably can stream this from mutiple (legit) sources right now.  Well, that's my two cents worth.  FYI, this actually rented really good when it first came out on DVD, people were fans of it for a while.<br /><br />Watch this solo with a plate of nachos and enjoy.  Don't forget to pick out something your girlfriend likes too.  In fact forget seeing a movie in, take her to see that new Zach Efron movie...
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! oddly addictive though. I have never bought any of those gems though, I still won't, but that's just me. overall great game!
B000002HAF|3.0|I love this album, and havent heard it on a CD since like 94. Dont remember the sound being so low. Can Barely hear most of the vocals throughout. Keep it cranked at full volume just to hear it proper. So, love the album, not thrilled about the sound quality.<br /><br />..Oh, I should probably add that it was the 1992 release that i ordered, not the remastered version.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone is talking about this book and trying to over analyze it.  Is it degrading to women? Is it a healthy relationship? Yadda, yadda.  It's fiction, it's for entertainment-don't take it too seriously.  It's a great story with some adventurous sex and likeable characters.  Men-pay attention to the trend of these books that are so popular now. It seems we women are falling in love with male characters that have dominant personalities and a take charge persona. Yes, I'm all for equal rights for women but deep down I think we we still want a man to feel possessive of us and sweep us off our feet.  The main character Christian has appealing qualities that women are falling for, just like Edward from Twilight. He has some issues but he is genuinely a good person.  Anastasia may be somewhat submissive but she speaks up for herself when it's important to her. I truly loved these books and had a hard time putting them down.  They're sexy, witty and well-written. I'm trying to get my husband to read them so he can pick up some pointers!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|my mommy took me to store called toys r us my favorite part of the store was babys r us they had stuff in there that was for 4 year Olds I think stuff like tinkertoys is a little bit intense for 4 year Olds i mean I'm only 20 and I think those things were scathe bye bye I have to go take poopy
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am partial to fantasy as a genre and only rarely dip into science fiction, but this was well worth my time. I was surprised that this was a self-published book, but some of the flaws I found in the writing make sense now.<br />Overall, Howey builds an amazing, dystopic world that you can completely lose yourself in. The world he builds is rich with details both in imagery and scientific. As a tech/science junkie, I bought into the science part of this fiction totally. It is well-planned and thoroughly thought out. I'm not sure if this is the case if I was looking at one book in particular, but reading 1 through 5 as a unit, I can state the previous comment with absolute certainty. There isn't any detail about the world or the people that leaves you hanging.<br />In terms of plot, I was thoroughly pleased with not only a satisfyingly exciting plot, but also with mundane parts that were always fraught with an underlying tension. Subplot threads are wrapped up nicely by the end of the 5th book and allow for you to focus entirely on the main plot that will continue in the 6th book.<br />Here is my major complaint: Howey needs work on character building. All of the books are written in third-person limited with occasional jumps into the minds of the characters. Unfortunately, sometimes in an effort to reinforce certain character traits, the internal dialogues can feel ham-fisted. I definitely think that this is his greatest weakness: he can get inside of his characters' heads, but is noticeably uncomfortable there. This is mostly true when his characters' lives aren't endangered or there isn't some great swell of emotion to work through. It can make the internal dialogue about the mundane aspects of the characters' lives a bit of a slog to read through. It is possible that the reason stems from almost no divorce of the narrator's voice and the character's voice, but our internal voices are never as clear as the narrator, so sometimes the language feels stiff.<br />Ultimately a wonderful series that I hope Howey continues to write. Maybe he'll get picked up by Tor....one can only hope!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game and I'm so glad I can play it finally!!! I just wish I had more people to play with!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This series is wonderful.  There are a group of us who gather on Wednesday afternoon and show 2 episodes at a time.  Like a Matinee. Can't wait for next season.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|why would u get it its not good...I rated it good cause it is not good... it is in aproprrite language and movements not for kids under 84. nobody get it.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|i would say its freaking awesome excet that it takes me forever to get it to load... and.or play... takes atleast 5 minutes
B0074EIQUG|1.0|I feel like the Lone Ranger in expressing my opinion of this CD. While most reviewers (so far) say they are delighted with the album, I think it is dreadful. The only thing I'll remember is the price.<br /><br />Dr. John has long been a favorite of ours and we own four or five of his CDs, but 'Locked Down' is not the Dr. John we liked. This album is undisciplined, un-pretty 'music.'<br /><br />We tried to listen to the entire album, but gave up after five songs (there are 10 of them)  and offered the disk to a neighbor kid, who will listen to anything.<br /><br />The tunes seem to have 16-bar introductions (way too long), then dissolve into chaos. Sounds like it was recorded in a barn or a warehouse.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm suspicious of some of the other reviews. Too practiced, like contrived hype, 'insiderish.' (That's a problem with Amazon reviews, they can be rigged.)<br /><br />Do any of these songs have a melody?<br /><br />Sing one. Hum one. I dare you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not sure why everyone is so negative in their reviews of this book.<br />I'm sorry....were you looking for Shakespear?<br />Lighten up....<br />Anyway.....I LOVED this book! It is what it is.....browsing the internet I saw it referred to as \\"housewife porn\\".  Yes...Yes it is....and that's exactly what I thought it was when I picked it up....and that's exactly what I got!<br />If you're looking for a quick erotic read...this is it.<br />If you're looking for some deep hidden meaning...well....move along.<br /><3<br />Katie

B007G3H8Y0|3.0|I was eager to hear Train's new music, as I became a big fan in the last few years and saw them 3 times live, and loved them in concert. There are a few songs I like on this CD, but they don't seem to write songs like \\"Drops of Jupiter\\", \\"Calling All Angels\\" or \\"Meet Virginia\\" anymore. These songs sound more like \\"Hey, Soul Sister\\". Very commercial sounding. They are big on dropping famous people's names, references to pop culture, news stories, etc. all over this CD, and I really don't want to hear that when I'm just trying to enjoy some good music. I'll just keep listening to their earlier stuff because I think it's better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my husband and 4 yr old cant get enough they are constantly playing. it helps my daughter with her hand eye coordination too!
020530902X|3.0|I found this book to be so-so.  If you're already a decent writer, most of the styles you learn about are common sense.  However, if you don't write all that much you may find it useful.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|The daily reminders to play are annoying, and it isn't super stable.  that said, it's free and fairly entertaining with short levels, ideal for a mobile game.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|No complaints. Works just as described with no flickering. The ability to charge while watching is worth the extra $
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|To me the hunger games was a amazing trilgry but mockingjay was a little slow for me. But i did like the plot of the story.
0385342063|3.0|I LOVE Sophie Kinsella, but lately all of the heroines in her book are starting to blur in my mind! Nearly all of them are underestimated by the people in their lives, they are sort of flighty, are dealing with a high powered man dealing with some sort of company in crisis, and will eventually save the day surprising all those who underestimated them. I'm not saying that I don't enjoy her books, I love chic lit, I love her sweet and sometimes dopey characters, but with this new book I was hoping for something a little bit different, a plot that didn't feel like I had already read it at least 3 times, and for me, this book was a dissapointment. I will always love Sophie Kinsella (I have every single one of her books in hard cover), and will always buy her books, I just wish the next one would be a bit different.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A nice light diversion; simple mechanics, nice graphics, suitable for play by or around children.  Good for short breaks, easy to pick up again later.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought catching fire was the best aout of all of the books because the trubites arent the only dangrus thing out there
0307394549|5.0|I am an avid baker and a cook book junkie and although I have TONS of recipes and books to choose from, I keep finding myself going back to this book. I love that at the beginning of the book there are pages dedicated to different catagories of cookie textures (e.g. there is a Chewy cookie page with a picture and page number for every chewy cookie recipe in the book). The pictures are beautiful and very helpful, the recipes are delicous (I have NEVER been a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies until this book- they are crave worthy). I have given this book as gifts because of how useful I have found it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its the best game I have on my kindle its so much fun and it is so additive I definetly regimens this game
B00571F26Y|5.0|I purchased \\"Wheat Belly: Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health\\" on my Kindle several days after starting a wheat elimination \\"diet\\".  I had been suffering with constant nasal drip for over a year and was seeking the cause.<br /><br />My research on inflammation and wheat elimination led me to this book and Dr. Davis' blog at [...].  Dr. Davis' writing style is conversational, so for me reading it was nearly effortless.  I finished reading the book in less than two days.  The book contains both scientific study and a boatload of anecdotal evidence of Dr. Davis' personal success with his patients going wheat free and his own story.  He and his patients are healthier and have relieved key health problems like type 2 diabetes, arthritis symptoms and high cholesterol.<br /><br />I have been wheat free for six weeks and plan to continue this regimen because my symptoms have been greatly reduced by removing wheat from my diet.  I noticed a difference in my symptoms in about two days and great improvement after about 2 weeks.  In addition I have noted that my belly is less puffy than it was before and my food cravings are less than before.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking to improve his/her health.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|fun as ever and finally on the kindle fire cant wait to draw recommend everyone gets it because the other one sucks so bad
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Aside from the repetitive scenes and dialogue, Christian Grey's addictive character makes it all worth it. Also, the ending didn't give me much closure. Luckily it looks like E.L. James wrote a preview to her next book, \\"Shades of Christian\\", which is pretty much Christian Grey narrating the book. I'd much rather be inside his head then Anastasia's.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I quickly dove into this book as I finished the first one. The story is so moving, probably one of the best love stories I have read in a long time. The reader really gets to know the characters better in the second book and the author's write paints a very vivid image of their feelings and love.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app, it is so accurate. And I really like the 15 day forecast too. Overall the graphics are amazing!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This show is awesome. So far it follows the book pretty close. I can't wait to see the second season. I recomend it to everyone. If I had to pick one thing I didn't like it would be that they didn't show the one big battle scene. The series Rome did this a lot and I didn't like it in that either. Hopefully that is the only time they do it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down literally finished it in one day. The story is soooo good you just want to learn more and find out what will happen next. Truly a great enjoyable read, a wonderful and HOT story!

B006OCM0G0|5.0|very addicting, but parents instead of giving 1 star reviews how about you read about what you are downloading for your kids....and taking a look at the app yo make sure its appropriate for your children. because if you did that you would realize that in the app info it clearly says please note digital content in this app can be purchased with actual money!!!'<br />overall this is a very fun and adficting game!!!
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Loved this movie on 2 levels.  It is a very interesting movie about Prime Minister Thatcher's life and political career in an era when women weren't typically in political office.  On another level it is the movie of an aging woman trying to hold it together.  It easily streamed through my Roku without freezing up or reloading even once!  Good picture clarity and sound
B003L77FYS|5.0|While this is my favorite tv show I wanted a DVD of the season so that I could view again favorite episodes.  The specials (deleted scenes etc) that come with a DVD enhanced my understanding of the series.  Worth every penny.  The DVD was used but in excellent condition and arrived promptly.
0345803485|5.0|Was it perfectly written, no. But it did what any good book should, It brought me to another world. I found my self wanting to be Ana. I coulnd't put the books down and I can't wait to read them again... but that is just me.

That was not on the DVD I received.  I paid a high price for an average film.  I would like someone to send me the original film.  Why was the price so high for the Americanized short version with no extras?  Was this a scam?

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played a lot of different solitaire games before. Most of them were a rip off and not worth the time to download them much less the money to buy them. This game though is very worth it and I play it everyday.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the only negative remark I have is that things start getting outrageous in price. every small plot of land goes up by 50k each time you buy one. also wish it wasn't just an app so I had some neighbors and could complete some of the goals that I cannot. otherwise love the game. the animals are starting to be ridiculous in price as well. if you do not have the time to spend making money on the game you will spend real money doing the challenges...which is I guess their point.
044042321X|5.0|As a true \\"a song of ice and fire\\" fan, this graphic novel complements the books very well. All the main characters are depicted truthfully from the books. This novel also summarizes the books very well so you cant get lost in the many storylines that make these books so fascinating.I can't wait for the next graphic novel to come out! (together with the two last books of course :))

B000OCXMAE|2.0|After 2 really good albuns, HYBRID THEORY and METEORA, Linkin Park really turns me off of their sound with minutes to midnight...besides WHAT I´VE DONE and GIVEN UP, i don´t really like any other song...they COMPLETELLY changed their metal rap sound for some emo without attitude or inspiration....Really not a good one...stick with the first 2 LP albuns...
1439102732|4.0|SING YOU HOME alternates between three main characters, one male and two female. Picoult does an amazing job of telling their stories, from the first person. All are flawed, all are wonderful, all are on a road of learning and healing, and their lives are intertwined. I imagine some will be put off by Picoult's position on some hot button political and social issues (refraining from spoilers here), but if you focus on Picoult's gifted writing and the humanity of each character - where they've been and where they're going - I think most will find this to be a really engaging read. I had the pleasure of reading it in two days while on vacation. I couldn't put it down and was sorry to see it end!

B0078N2MTE|5.0|\\"Take Shelter\\" is definitely not the movie for you if you need fast-paced action.  It is also a little strange.  It seems like a lot of the people who did not enjoy this movie disliked it because they were expecting a movie where you run from tornadoes as they rip through the town.  This movie is not Twister!<br /><br />With that said, it is the type of movie that has subtle bits of plot development that build up as time progresses.  It is a tiny bit horror (Curtis, the main character, has some pretty scary dreams!), and very much a psychological drama.  At first, you're not sure if Curtis is going crazy, and as the movie progresses, you feel more unsure of his sanity. The ending is somewhat ambiguous, which I don't see as a bad thing.<br /><br />This movie is really driven by the characters, and the relationships between them.  You see Curtis trying do what he thinks is best for himself and his family, while everything seems to fall apart because of dreams and what they are doing to his mind.  One of the other reviewers called Take Shelter \\"A portrait of courage,\\" and I would have to agree! Both Curtis and his wife have such emotional courage.If you are afraid of tornadoes, this movie may be pretty frightening at times!<br /><br />One thing I have to mention is how dead-on the depiction of small town, Northeastern Ohio is.  The way the people interact with one another, how people speak, dress, and drive.  This added a special touch for me, someone who is from the area, and added a bit of reality for me.
B000067FP8|5.0|GREMLINS II is as cool as the first Gremlin movie, which was real funny!!!Really interesting film about these little monsters...
B000UX6OHK|3.0|I love this watch, but the battery seems to only last about a year and I have not been able to have it replaced.  After the first year, Nordstrom (where I originally bought the first one) tried to change the battery and was not able to so they gave me a brand new watch.  About a year or so later, the watch started losing time and I took it to a watch shop and the guy said it wan't the battery.  I get soooo many compliments on this watch and I love it so much, I searched and was happy to find it on Amazon (I think it is an old style).  Within only a month or so, the watch started losing time.  Oddly enough, when I reset the time, it keeps up for several months before it starts losing time again.  The style of the watch obviously means more to me than the correct time or I wouldn't continue to wear it.

I just want to play the game and level up. it seems as though this game needs to be worked on a little more. if you have patients for a glitchy game then go ahead and get it otherwise forget about it.

B0050DIWHU|5.0|I picked up this book mainly because of Reid Hoffman. I figured that the guy who has co-founded such a successful business like LinkedIn and have invested in companies like Zynga and Facebook must have a thing or two to to share. This book took me by surprise, not only it has very useful information about how to grow your carrier, how to network but also have lots of to the point action list. After every chapter he talks about taking certain actions today, week from now and month from now to grow your network and carrier. I have already started doing some of them and its really been helping me for last few months.

It's just has  a little more flavor to it.<br /><br />I am now working on book 2 \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and book 3 \\"Fifty Shades Freed' is waiting in the wings.I purchased them both on Amazon as well.

0525423656|3.0|I didn't read the review comments regarding Crossed, as I wanted to form my own with no influence. That said, I was quite disappointed in this second book. My biggest issue is that the story didn't delve deeply into the character interactions. When there was some excitement with Ky and Cassia, we read a few of their thoughts. They spoke \\"outloud' to one another in a manner that made me feel if I were listening to them, their conversation would have lasted 5-10 minutes at most. The book seemed dark to me. Not a lot of happy moments. When there were happy moments, they were short with no lasting impression other than relative sadness.<br /><br />I was expecting an emotional reunion of Ky and Cassia, almost an epic moment. I felt that did not happen. This girl gave up everything to run across a land she's never seen before, do things she has never done before. That's epic. To me, when Ky and Cassia came face to face, Ky felt 'Oh good news, you found me. You must love me more than Xander.\\" I wanted much more than what I read.<br /><br />I'm going to quote Gretchen, as what she wrote sums up how I felt about this second book. In Gretchen's quote, the name of the third book was still untitled. It is now titled \\"Reached\\". I really agree that the characters came across as simply Condie's character sketches, and Condie leaves us with nothing more.<br /><br />\\"The thing about Crossed is that it really wasn't a book. Sure, there was a vague plotline taking place, but if I was being kind I'd call it filler in between Matched and the final and yet untitled third book. It was barely even that. Reading Crossed felt like reading Condie's character sketches and paragraphs of her own personal delve into her world's background.\\"

B006OAB3ME|1.0|There have always been two competing, conflicting trends pervading Paul McCartney's musical career. One, he undeniably is a great musical talent. He can rock when he wants to and at one time was a superb tune smith. Another trend, a contradictory one, is that he is a rank sentimentalist.<br /><br />He was careful to balance the two trends in the beginning. This trend surfaced early in Paul's career with the song, \\"Yesterday.\\" Lennon was incensed by this song, and considered Paul a traitor to rock and roll with the release of this song. But Paul rocked on with other Beatles songs like \\"I'm Down\\" and \\"She's a Woman.\\" That last one was actually by all accounts a true collaborative effort. No matter, the point is that if he put out a sentimental song, he would balance it afterwards with a rocker.<br /><br />This is not to say that sentiment is wrong. Far from it. When PM was at the zenith of his solo musical talents, shortly after he left the Beatles, the results were magnificent. The mistake that many music lovers made when listening to \\"Silly Love Songs,\\" is that they were confusing Paul the rocker and Paul the rank sentimentalist, and wanting him to rock instead of waxing sentiment.<br /><br />There were two other trends which at times worked against each other. Paul has always been willing to experiment. This is a good thing, and can yield good reasons. McCartney II, for example, was Paul's experiment into electronics which was one of John Lennon's personal favorite albums Paul released. It showed a lot of courage, it rocks and was a good, if underrated, album. He has since released efforts with the Firemen, which is respectable ambient music.<br /><br /> But there is another trend which is problematic. He has an almost maniacal impulse to churn out product, no matter how good or bad it may be. This rarely produces good results; in fact, more likely than not, it produces garbage. Much of his efforts at classical music fits into this category. The music is forgettable -- it really isn't his music at all. Paul McCartney, like many rock musicians, cannot read or write musical notation. Consequently, when PM releases a classical release, it is usually a collaboration with a recognized musician, who has written down PM's musical ideas, much like dictation. This irrational desire to release albums and songs is a hit and miss thing. It is usually a \\"miss,\\" however, and produces garbage. Like this album.<br /><br />Words really cannot convey how bad this album truly is. The crooning I don't mind, but McCartney doesn't croon very well. He falters, he hesitates, his voice cracks -- not an inflected, intentional, crack, but a crack of a seventy-year old washed-up rocker. This album is an embarrassment; it is an outrage; it is just a poor rendition of lounge singing. Paul is a complex, complicated musical talent, much more than John ever was, but this album is surprisingly simple. It is simply BAD.<br /><br />While listening to this album my thoughts were with the old Saturday Night Live. In the early shows the troupe would do skits called \\"Bad Theatre,\\" Bad Poetry,\\" and the like, portraying, well, a play or poetry poorly done, usually hosted by Dan Akroyd. While listening to this album I thought, \\"If the old SNL were around they would call this  \\"Bad Music.'\\"<br /><br />I also thought of that Bill Murray character -- I couldn't concentrate on the music, it was so terrible -- of the cheesy lounge singer in the glitter tux and slicked back hair, who, of course, thought he was good and cool, but was, of course, terrible.<br /><br />Then I thought, well, maybe Paul is releasing this album for the sake of irony, as a kitsch experiement, a parody on lounge singing and lounge singers. No, he really thinks this stuff is good and he's doing a good job. Well, it is not and he doesn't.<br /><br /> The only parody is the title of the album, Kisses on the Bottom. What's up with the title of the album anyway? This is apparently Paul's attitude for anyone foolish enough to buy this album. If you don't like my album, well, you can just,  ....<br /><br /> This is not to say that all interpretation of standards are all bad. Far from it. Rod Stewart is a good example of an ex-rocker who is successful in his interpretation of song standards. But Rod Stewart makes no pretensions of being a rock and roll star anymore. He left that persona, sadly, years ago. But he is good at what he does. Stewart's voice is perfectly matched to sing these classics; he is a befitting successor to Tony Bennett.<br /><br /> But Paul McCartney singing lounge songs?  Paleeez. Other reviews have noted that his voice is creepy. There is some truth to this. His voice lacks the intimacy that is must be present whenever engaging in this type of singing. So Paul is deliberately softening his voice to give it that soft intimacy, to make it more personal. What he has done, of course, is exposed the natural weaknesses of advancing old age, making his voice sound foreign and, yes, a little creepy. All those years of yelping like Little Richard have taken a toll on his voice. To me, though, his singing is just plain bad. Bad, bad, bad.<br /><br /> And this is not to say that the album is totally irredeemable. As in all CDs, if you inadvertently buy this album, it will make an excellent coaster, and can be used as a reflector, or a car ornament. Or you might do the Green thing and simply recycle this CD to your local recycle center. This is probably the best use of this CD. It is not fit for listening, so do something contructive and good for the environment. It's no good as music. It is a joke, sadly on anyone who buys this CD.one foolish enough to buy this album.

B00650SSDU|4.0|FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS  is a bit of a twist on the usual run of romantic comedies; hook-ups are for sexual gratification only with no emotional strings attached -unless.... And that is where this film starts out, with a lot of promise. The story is by Harley Peyton with assistance from Keith Merryman  and David A. Newman who with director Will Gluck adapted the story for the screenplay. Sound like a lot of cooks to spoil the broth? Well, in part it probably is as there are many little subplots here that bump into each other.<br /><br />Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a New York head-hunter trying to sign Los Angeles-based Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) for her client. When he takes the job and makes the move, they quickly become friends. Their friendship turns into a friendship with benefits, but with Jamie's emotionally damaged past and Dylan's history of being emotionally unavailable, they have to try to not fall for each other the way Hollywood romantic comedies dictate.  Add to this fairly substantial idea the gay character Tommy  Bollinger (Woody Harelson in a fine little cameo) and Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's galavanting mother and the mix becomes funny. Despite a rather intrusive copout ending there is PLENTY of eye candy from Timberlake and Kunis and lots of bed romping. It's goofy but entertaining and it does show that Justin Timberlake is becoming a fine leading man on screen.  Grady Harp, April 12
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was not impressed with this book.  I enjoyed the other two a lot more.  Really hope they DON'T make a movie out of this one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger games was the first book I downloaded to my kindle. It was easy to read & loved reading it after seeing the movie.

I would have loved them to be a little smaller and thinner.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|This was one of those instances where low expectations really paid off. Had I realized that the film was directed by Nicholas Stoller (the man behind Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek), then I may have had a bit more confidence in it.<br /><br />Trailers made it seem like The Five-Year Engagement wasn't going to be so great though. It just looked like every other formulaic R-rated comedy out there. Several people who also attended the screening I went to felt the same way. \\"This'll be decent at best,\\" we all thought. Thankfully we were gob smacked with something a lot better than okay that was just shy of being really great.<br /><br />The Five-Year Engagement is obviously centered on Tom and Violet, but the supporting cast is so freaking good. The Alex and Suzie characters are hilarious. Suzie has this party girl kind of quality to her, but she's so emotional and really spontaneous. Alex is the typical jock/playboy type of character, but his one-liners are really funny. At their wedding, Alex sings this song to Suzie in Spanish. That alone is fantastic, but his facial expressions just take it to an entirely different level of hilarity.<br /><br />Violet's classmates in college; Ming (Randall Park), Doug (Kevin Hart), and Vaneetha (\\"The Office\\"'s Mindy Kaling) have more than their share of stand-out scenes. Tarquin (Brian Posehn) is funny in this really inappropriate way and Bill's (Chris Parnell) fascination with knitting sweaters is a gag that somehow never really gets old.<br /><br />Tom and Violet have so many classic scenes, as well. The bedroom conversation where Tom just wants to be alone is the first that comes to mind. Then there's the fake orgasm scene and Tom's ridiculous apron. The scene people will probably be talking about most though is the scene when Violet and Suzie are having a conversation while imitating Cookie Monster and Elmo. That might be the most humorous sequence in the entire comedy.<br /><br />The Five-Year Engagement isn't just a flat comedy though. It has layers to it. These characters feel like they have some depth to them. There's character development and drama, heartbreak and depression, and compassion and reconnection on top of the comedy. It's a comedy that makes a complete cycle to actually feel like you're witnessing an authentic relationship.<br /><br />The film does feel a bit long though. The second act just drags on and on at times. Some of the psychology bits didn't seem completely necessary to the storyline either and the last hour could've been trimmed down a good twenty to thirty minutes.<br /><br />The Five-Year Engagement runs longer than it should, but is otherwise a very charming R-rated romantic comedy. The way these characters are planned out and the decisions they make feel very human. Delightfully sincere and downright hilarious at times, The Five-Year Engagement is a pleasant surprise and a fantastic date night comedy that will appeal to both sexes.'t just a flat comedy though.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|There's never been a book more appropiately titled. I think I felt every conceivable emotion at least once during this roller coaster. So beautifully poignant and perceptive in describing the erratic emotions of youth knocking on the door of adulthood/maturity. The story, although told in present day first person, had an incredible feel of a memoir from the past. As if Abby were recounting her and Travis' story to her adolescent grandchild stuggling with similar \\"youth\\" turmoil. The story is messy but beautiful. I think that's the point. It's life.<br />I found it impossible to put this book down.
B006ZEDZNY|2.0|I rented this movie from Amazon and did not read the book.  The film is about a writer that drinks a lot that is hired by a practically worthless newspaper in Puerto Rico.  The story rambles, has no real plot, there are a few funny Johnny Depp moments, but really left me wanting more from that 2 hours of my life.<br /><br />The scenery was good and Amber Heard is hot hot.  If you are looking for something mindless and have 2 hours to waste, this might work.  Otherwise, I wouldn't see it.

B007KZY1YY|3.0|After reading a review in the Sunday Telegraph I was intrigued and bought the whole series. This book is defintely a few steps up from the old Mills and Boon romances and verges on soft or hard porn (depending how liberal minded you are). There was so much kinky sex through the book I got to the stage of just glancing through it to get to the story line.<br />There is a plot that follows through the series of the books, and it is quite good. Unfortunatley the plot is only small and the sex is very very large.<br />If this was in real life I think the girl would have been very very worn out by the end of the first book. It was a fun read, don't need to concentrate to much to keep track of the story, and you might even learn a few things (I know I did but don't think I will try them).

B0017I1IZA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Janet has a way of heating it up without giving any info. Hard Eight did have a little bit of sizzle. Stephanie Plum is a lovable character, I just with that Ms. Evanovich would have developed her more by the 8th book. Stephanie seems to be up to the same old and hasn't changed much. This is probably the pinnacle of the series, it's pretty much downhill (although slowly at first) from here.
B000AYQJ3I|4.0|There were 5 songs, on the original album that I bought 30 years ago, that Bob Dylan performed with George, Leon and Ringo.  The DVD only has 4.  Mr. Tambourine Man is missing.  Why?  The Dylan portion of the concert is definitely classic and without question the PEAK of the whole concert (especially Just Like A Woman) and it is cut short on the DVD.  TOO BAD.  For being 40+ years old the video and sound is pretty good, video a little on the dark side but considering it's age it is not a big complaint.  The missing song knocks it down one notch.
0060955775|5.0|One cannot judge a book by its cover, the American idiom suggests; as I sat reading a passerby interjects:  \\"Geez, that title sounds so morbid\\". On the contrary the book dwells not on death but on the joys inherent in life. The book is not about suicide, as it seems- it's about living, and learning to live.<br /><br />On November 11, 1997, Veronika decided that the moment to kill herself had arrived.  Feeling unfulfilled & vitriol consumed (poisoned by bitterness), she decides that she would be better off dead.  By our society's standards she has everything she needs to be happy. She is living but she is not alive. She is a 24 year old young woman that hasn't yet discovered the purpose of life and she concludes that a life governed by the expectations of others is a farce, which has reduced her to a shallow empty shell, essentially a breathing marionette.<br /><br />And I quote: \\"The great problem with poisoning by Bitterness was that the passions -- hatred, love, despair, enthusiasm, curiosity -- also ceased to manifest themselves. After a while, the embittered person felt no desire at all. They lacked the will either to live or to die, that was the problem.\\"<br /><br />As told to Veronika- and I quote: \\"You are someone who is different, but who wants to be the same as everyone else. And that in my view is a serious illness. God chose you to be different. Why are you disappointing God with this kind of attitude?\\"<br /><br />Veronika, was not content with the regular monotony of life that most of us live and needed a greater purpose to be alive, so after a failed suicidal attempt is shocked to awaken in Villete, a Slovenian mental hospital, only to be told that while she was not successful in dying she has committed herself to death as the overdose damaged her heart, as she now has but a few days left to live. Insightfully; it takes the imminence of death to make her discover that being alive is more than living.<br /><br />Thusly; life becomes precious when you realize that it will end. The premise of the book on one level is that we can only appreciate life when it is fully lived and/or is about to end, and additionally, sends a powerful message to all who live life attempting to conform as opposed to living.<br /><br />These allotted days turn out to be the only time in her life that she truly lives wholeheartedly. Energetically, emotionally, artistically, passionately & sexually, as she plunges into a series of explorations and adventures that allow her to become a radiating & loving independent being and not the product of societal expectations. While not advocating mayhem or disorder, the author uses Veronica's journey to exemplify that total compliance with external demands doesn't only regulate existence- it also strips it of value.  And I quote: \\"You have two choices: to control your mind or to let your mind control you.\\"<br /><br />This is a magical tale about striving to always discover new emotions, feelings, & reasons for living.  It is a beautiful yet tragic miracle (of fiction) that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the trip of self discovery as this adventure speaks to all of us. I certainly left this book with more than I went into it with.  It resonated so powerfully with me, as it really moved me and inspired me to think - about intrinsic purpose, self truth, love, life and so much more. The author does encourage readers, through Veronika's example, to live each minute as if it might be your last, and treat your life like the precious gift it is. And I quote: \\"She would consider each day a miracle - which indeed it is, when you consider the number of unexpected things that could happen in each second of our fragile existences.\\"<br /><br />I do not, at this point want in any manner to spoil the read, but yes; the ending does have a remarkable 12th hour twist :)

B007CKNX28|3.0|Jim Morrison would have been proud. This is a great Doors album. Jack White has always been a bridge to the past, but he usually find a new and exciting way to update an old sound, not so with Blunderbuss. In my opinion, this album is pure piano heavy 70's soft rock with the exception of sixteen salteens. Frankly, its boring. I will give it a few more listens, and if my opinion doesn't improve I will give it away. Jack White's schtick has always centered around simplicity, a hard blues edge, and modernizing the past... he's only revisited the past here... nothing new, nothing edgy, nothing revolutionary. I'm sorry Jack, I wanted to like it so much, this was the first CD I've bought in 5 years, but I just don't.

1451627289|1.0|I think the only reason I continued reading this book is because I paid $17.  It seemed like such a great plot, but it was too violent and went on forever.  This book could have easily been 400 pages shorter.  At first I thought maybe this was more of a \\"man's\\" book, but in the end I just don't think the story lived up to its potential.  I would definitely suggest checking this one out at the library.  If you don't love it in the first 100 pages, quit while you are ahead.

This is a lovely, hypnotic, spiritual song that will soar into your head and heart, ever more so with every listen. What a great gift of joy from the BB. I made a CD of it just to listen to it while cruising around the beach and freeways of LA. Open your minds to it and you will be soon spellbound by the melody, groove and celestial harmony.

Some of the relationships I've read about before, but there were others, I didn't know too much about--I've always loved the Ford/Carter relationship, and the still going on Clinton/GHW Bush relationship.  They are quite fascinating when you really think about it.

0385534639|5.0|I LOVED this book so much I'm having trouble starting a new one. There have been a lot of reviews that can give you the thorough description you may be looking for. I just wanted to add a few more ideas to what's already here. I didn't hear that this was being compared to Twilight and Harry Potter until after I read it, and I'm glad I didn't have that in my head while reading this book. It's a lot more like Phantom of the Opera. It's all about the scenery, and the costumes, and the music, not character development or plot. I love the atmosphere of this book. It doesn't matter to me that the love story aspect takes a back seat. If they DO make this into a movie, I hope they put their money into the sets and special effects.
0375842209|5.0|Book Thief is told from the point of view from death and his perspective on things.It took me a while to figure that out.(spoiler alert)I cried reading this book and I never cry over a book and I read a lot.I cried when the bombs hit and everybody died.The saddest part of the whole story to me was when Liesel found Rudy's body and she goes hysterical and starts kissing him.Rudy was my favorite character and maybe that's why I took it so hard when he died.All that Rudy wanted was a kiss and he got it but alas it was too late.It hurts me heart to know that Rudy could have lived if he was sent to a different school.The Book Thief will forever be one of my favorites.I would highly recommend you buy this book if you are deciding to purchase this item.
B0044AS6BC|5.0|In the early stages of Stephen King's career, he wanted to put his own twist on some of the hallmarks of the horror genre, including vampires with Salem's Lot and the haunted house story, or in this case haunted hotel, with The Shining. This horrific tale of ghosts, possession, and murder ranks as one of King's all-time scariest, and spawned the Stanley Kubrick film that most regard as a classic in its own right. Most fans are aware that King was disappointed by some aspects of that film, including its failure to establish that Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel as a good father, a dedicated family man who would never think of bringing harm to his wife or son. In many ways, Torrance reflects the pressures and frustration King himself experienced as a young husband and father, a character prone to the same occasional impatience or anger as any normal person. However, when those frailties are placed in the hands of the malevolent forces at work in the Overlook, they become warped and distorted. Jack's descent into insanity is a gradual process initiated and controlled by external influences, a point left ambiguous in Kubrick's film. The film even hints at an inherent madness in the character before ever reaching the Overlook, so the differences from King's story are significant. Kubrick also excludes King's central metaphor of the boiler, which Jack has to release the pressure from periodically to avoid a powerful explosion. It's used in the novel to represent Jack's escalating rage as his mental instability progresses and is key to the book's plot, particularly the climax. I'm not knocking the filmmaking of Kubrick, but like most King fans, I prefer the novel. If you're looking for a scare and haven't already read The Shining, imagine the possibilities of an enormous hotel filled with malicious ghosts, a small, young family snowed in and isolated from all civilization, and the writing of a young Stephen King. One of King's top five novels.

B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Following Train since the beginning their sound has changed through the years. Their last few CD's started adding a few songs with lyrics that were fun, kinda funky and eclectic. California 37 takes fun, funky and eclectic to a whole new level. There's whistling, bag pipes, ukulele, Latin sounding brass and a country tune mixed with some rock n roll and a few more serious songs among this eclectic mix. The songs with grin value are This'll Be My Year (a similar style to We Didn't Start the Fire but about life along the way for lead singer, Pat Monahan), 50 Ways to Say Goodbye, You Can Finally Meet My Mom, Drive By and Mermaid. Drive By is a catchy tune and will no doubt do well on the Pop charts while Bruises (w/Ashley Monroe) would probably go just as far with country fans. California 37 is about Train and a thanks to fans. Sing Together, We Were Made For This and When the Fog Rolls In rounds out a CD very nicely done.

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I can't get it to open on the Kindle Fire. This is, as they say, jank man. I really wanted to play this. :( fix this and I'll change my review.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Finally a fun brain game. I deleted all the other games on my device because this one is all I play now
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app and its FINALLY HERE! I bought it the day it came out on kindle fire. IT WAS TWO DOLLARS THREE DAYS AGO. NOW IT'S FREE?!?!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Hard to put down.  I love it.  challenging.  creative. pretty.  smooth.  really fun and filled with strategy.  so much fun.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun game to chill out with. I agree with a previous reviewer though, I dislike the facebook/review reminder. Four solid stars.
B001GQ2TGA|1.0|Enya's seventh album is a series of strung together clichés that is better forgotten about.<br /><br />Not bad considering when the other six releases are excellent.<br /><br />If in doubt just listen to Watermark or the BBC soundtrack by Enya to the film The Celts.<br /><br />Then there is always the excellent DVD \\"Enya the Videos\\" that covers a selection five of Enya's seven albums.<br /><br />After listening to any of these you'll probably have forgotten about; \\"And Winter Came\\" and realise too that its just a series of uninspired strung together cliches.
B000XVSU9O|2.0|In an age where one is free to believe what they want rather than have the church order them to follow a particular faith, a new type of marketing has come along. No longer is it vegetables, fruits, land, horses. Now it's belief and faith based on hearsay.<br /><br />One can actually market belief.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I believe in Near-death experiences, but in an age where it's all too common and evidence has backed it up, you can rest your faith on those who don't particularly want your benefit in terms of truth.<br /><br />In the case of this author Betty Eadie, let me be clear. I have read all-too-many books on the Near-Death Experience and frequently have scientific debates with those who don't believe. It's clear across the board that, in fact, NDE's are the same wherever you live. If you live in a small town in India that doesn't even KNOW about America (there are many), you will still have the same happenings in your NDE that someone from America would have.<br /><br />Out of all the NDE's I have read about, Eadie's is the most detailed for sure. But when you make things up out of the blue then that is what you would expect.<br /><br />My stance on this book is that while it was entertaining (hence the extra star for 2-stars), it was horribly different from ANY NDE's I have ever read about and seems to be the basis of 2 things. The first is to publicize and market Betty Eadie for a cash flow (notice the picture of her in a gown The Awakening Heart, now notice pictures on the fraud-psychic books of Sylvia Browne where she, too, is showered in light). The second is to win those over to Christ. The Church has done some horrid things all around the world to convert people, as far as publishing NDE accounts of a child who went to hell and saw Michael Jackson there because he \\"touched little children\\".<br /><br />If you actually READ the book, you will find many facts in it just plain wrong. She said that God showed her that the world was 6,000 years old and even showed her the creation. First off, science disproves this so much so that to believe it would be utter nonsense (sorry if you do). The second is that in what other NDE have you ever seen God go to such great lengths to show someone something besides their life review? It doesn't follow NDE's to have him show her all of this stuff.<br /><br />The next is utter nonsense as well. She said that reincarnation wasn't real but rather the things we see when we do things like hypnotic regression into a past life is just us seeing the stuff stored in our DNA from someone down our past lineage (like a great, great, great, great grandfather). If she knew ANY of the literature on reincarnation she would know just how fallacious this idea is.  Look at Tom Shroder's book Old Souls. It utterly DESTROYS this idea of DNA memory.<br /><br />In short, I was appalled when I was reading this book. The information is so twisted that you would already need to BE a young-earth creationist Christian to believe any of it. I don't believe it for a second and, judging by the above mentioned marketing ideas, I can see right through the scheme.<br /><br />Sadly she has sold some people on faith. Personally, I like evidence more, and judging from gathered evidence I can say with an accuracy of 95% or greater that this book was written as a money-making, marketing ploy for the Eadie family.<br /><br />John McAdam:<br />Defense Against Atheism<br />Enoch and the Extraterrestrials<br />The Vampire Pilld and even showed her the creation.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books were very good. Each time I had to put my kindle down all I could think of was the book and how long until I could start reading it again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this whole series. I am about half way through the last book and I can't put it down. I love how relatable Ana is and how Christain takes her into a totally new world. This story will be every womans dream, to have a man that in control in the bedroom but still need emotional support (the thing that women are best at). Truely, truely an amazing trilogy. I can't wait to finish the 3rd one.<br /><br />my ONLY complaint is not knowing what really happend to Chirstain when he was little, whith his real mother. I would like more in depth information about his childhood.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The book started out boring. Bout 40% through is when the book started to get interesting. Stayed interesting until the end which could have had more to it than it did. Definitely not the authors best work and if I had to do ot over again I would not have bought it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|So much better on my Kindle Fire than on my iphone !!<br />  Thank you Thank you Thank you! !!!  Seems you guys know what we want and need :)
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|If I had known what this movie was actually about I doubt if I would have purchased it - weird movie for Clooney. I didn't do my home work enuf. and didn't really like it at all. It wouldn't play on my 'everyday' DVD player so had to find one it WOULD play on - a real pain!
B005R2S04E|1.0|Yes, this is the best black metal album since the last Metallica, but it's still not good. Plus the lyrics are whack. Check these out: \\"One of the methods to get a larger erected and size is `ballooning'. The ballooning technique includes prolonging the climax. Hence, this means in order to start the procedure, the very first thing to know is how to last longer. One must be able to retain his load back three to five times during performances. If it is becomes difficult to hold it back or withhold from it prematurely then he must first take some libido enhancing herbs to gain some endurance. This will put him on the track being more stimulating lover as well as will make him in a position to perform the Erectile Ballooning method.\\"
0545265355|5.0|I was very happy with this products! It came faster than what was suggested! Looking forward to reading the books.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is an awesome game. I love it! brings me back to my childhood. I wish it was harder, I finished in about two evenings.
B004EPYZV2|2.0|Mission Impossible 1 had both plot and decent action.  This movie continues the downward spiral of this series.  Tom Cruise may have jumped the shark with this movie.  I got tired of watching endless scenes of Cruise running through various streets and alleys.  Recommend buying Knight & Day on blu-ray instead...or buy season 3 of Justified when its available.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This product came in a very timely manner. It was easy to put on and so far has done a great job in protecting the kindle fire. It's easy to use and very secure. Like the ability to stand as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was very good and very very sad. I think I cried nonstop through the last third of the book, but it was absolutely worth it.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Yes the download took approx 1 hour on the Fire... the game itself is awesome, better than Lost City. Its a mix of puzzles/hidden objects
1466401885|1.0|I had to stop reading this halfway through. I also was deceived by the good reviews. The relationship between Abby and Travis was too violent and unhealthy for my interest. I know this is supposed to be more realistic than other romances out there to have actual, real fights, but I could not believe that she would be with him after he had sex with so many girls practically right in front of her. I was just not interested in reading any more of their story, as I didn't really like either character after a while. Also, it being self-published explains a lot--the copy editing was TERRIBLE and the story needs pruning.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|great game just one problem my kindle wont let me on it! !!! i love tgis game thouht !get it
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|me and my mom play the game when were bored!!! this game is totally worth it!!! you can also play nonlinear with random people.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|&quot;game requires additional data start download now&quot;  am sorry I paid for this.  I won't download anything more for this and I can't use it unless I do.  I guess I uninstall.  so long hard earned money.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|A very well crafted album. The musicianship is nothing less that you'll expect from this bunch. What's amazing is the chemistry and the songwriting. And Casey Mc Pherson (with who I wasn't too familiar before this album) was a revelation. I hope they'll keep it together, but even if it's only one off it's worth getting this album.
B001F12J48|4.0|The 3d on this was not the greatest, it was a little hard to watch. other then that the movie is great. The animation is great.
B007JWKLP6|1.0|While I am a huge Beatle fan as well as the guys individually, I could barely keep awake while watching this.  No full performances was disappointing as I know it was about George's life, but some rare perfromances would have made this a lot better.  Instead you get babbling and babbling that really didn't tell much about George. The story of how someone broke into his home and almost killed them was something of significance, but nothing else.  This was a Scorscese flop!
1613820895|5.0|I picked up this book about a week ago because it was recommended to me by a friend. I am so glad he told me to buy it! This book is perhaps the best book I have ever read!<br /><br />Chesterton completely caught me off guard 100 times during this short book. His main hypothesis is to describe what Orthodoxy really is, and I thought I knew what I was going to find. I was absolutely wrong. Chesterton makes it quite clear that his purpose in writing is to warn us to avoid things like \\"modernism,\\" or the falsely called \\"rationalism,\\" so that we can really be free (which is what Orthodox Christianity is all about). He also describes what it is like to be free, along with why Christianity is such a beautiful thing.<br /><br />The book is outlined as such:<br /><br />I. Introduction in Defense of Everything Else<br />II. The Maniac (hands down the biggest bomb to every hit my personal thought life was in the pages of this chapter)<br />III. The Suicide of Thought<br />IV. The Ethics of Elfland<br />V. The Flag of the World<br />VI. The Paradoxes of Christianity<br />VII. The Eternal Revolution<br />VIII. The Romance of Orthodoxy<br />IX. Authority and the Adventurer<br /><br />I'm not sure whether or not to label this a philosophy book, but it certainly feels as such. There are thoughts and ideas in this book that just want to burst off the page and be free in the minds of the greatest thinkers of all time.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B002RT85RW|5.0|I was afraid there could be some issues with TDK Blue-ray disks (based on my past experience with blank TDK DVDs), however, I burned a few of these and no single failure. I have external ASUS burner.
B006C45CFG|1.0|This movie is terrible.  Sorriest excuse for a script there ever was.  Soooo boring.  There aren't even any good cheesecake shots of Olivia Wilde.  Waste of time and money.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game... great graphics... addictive and challenging!  recommend this game for anyone who likes a puzzle that makes you think.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun but there arent any instuctions to play the game you have to figure it out on your own.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I am really enjoying this app with my Evernote app. I upload photos and personalize them and just write notes in my own handwriting. love it-thanks.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I was excited to recieve my Kindle Fire, and ordered this cover to arrive on the same day. The cover fits and protects the Fire well, and was easy to use and place the Fire into. I am slightly saddened that the stand does not work as well as I had hoped. Perhaps the Fire is to heavy for the design, but it doesn't stay in the tab all that well, so be careful. Still, a great buy for the price.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|also downloaded Skitch for drawing, writing on photos. songwriting and a health diary are some other things I use it for. It is on my laptop, Kindle Fire and Android phone. Great app! thanks.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I watched this late one night when everyone else was sleeping and I had the sound off. After a bit I did not even pay attention to the subtitles. I don't even look upon this work as a \\"Vampire film\\". I agree that this is a wonderful and masterful mixture of the \\"tender and the terrible\\" and I take it as a truly touching love story. Perhaps I am a bit twisted myself but there are many DVDs that I watch late at night with no sound and I am coming to the point where I think that in SOME works the sound is a distraction and unnecessary to the enjoyment of the work. I will purchase it regardless of the poor sound aspects. Perhaps I will buy both versions. Just thought I would share my reaction.
B000063JDE|5.0|I'll keep it short, but sweet.  Blue Velvet's amazing visuals, memorable performances, and haunting musical score have imbedded this film into my mind.  It's a bit dark, but if you like that kind of thing, this should be on your list.
0679805273|5.0|great message for young and old, no matter what season they are in their life,stated as only the great<br />Dr. sees can....
1439107955|4.0|The history of cancer is fascinating reading. The Emperor of All Maladies struck a particular chord with me since I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008. I am so thankful that I live in these times where treatments are more humane with better outcomes. To know fault of the author, the most discouraging part of the story is even though we have come so far, there is still much further to go!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is one of the best games i have ever played you should try it  u will love it!!!!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Not a bit happy that free verison unable to down load to my kindle fire. works on my smart phone should work on kindle. I guess their profit margin is down at this time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thrilling page turner.  Have to read to understand.  Lesson for spoiled teenagers of what life could be like!  Might want to go ahead and buy the trilogy first because you have to read the next ones right away.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|(If you just want to know what I wanted you to read, skip this paragraph.) I love this game. Good graphics, smooth drawing, and has a good respond time. I had no problems with facebook or anything else for that matter.<br />I've seen some comments that say this game is ripping off sketch with friends. This isn't true, at all. Sketch with friends and Draw Something are similar, but have to different designs. If anything, sketch with friends ripped off draw something because it(draw something) came out first.<br />Thank you for reading.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book and intend to now see the movie. I've started the second book and begin to the story arc developing. It's not your typical post-apocalypse tale, and for that I was really thankful. It might not be as deep and complex a story as some would like, but I think the majority of readers will be satisfied.
B0000457HB|5.0|This is the Ultimate Collection of the late, great, and brilliant Barry White. All the tracks on this double cd sound fresh and crystal clear. He was the voice of love and is missed by many. He left behind some great music that will play forever.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|too late no one plays this anymore. would have been nice if it came out a few months ago. I play like one drawing a day
B007V2UGPE|3.0|this game is pretty addicting. just don't like spending the cheese to upgrade certain things to fully enjoy the game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|thee games are very addictive I cant ever decide which one I want to unlock they all look so good at first I thought it was stupid because I sucked at the game but now I kick ass the games flare a lot of fun
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|Another strong effort from my favorite band. Loved all the songs on this one. A must have for any fan of the group. Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the way the author kept you in suspense. I didn't want to put it down. It is somewhat disturbing that communities enjoy people killing each other as a form of entertainment. I hope those attending the movie are enjoying the love story and not the killings.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|i enjoyed it while i could as it made my headphones louder like i wanted but on the third day it came apart and the buttons to control volume and power fell out and could not be found as i was on the bus and had to get to my class. turned out to be a waste of my money.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Okay, let me start by saying that this book was extremely well written and engaging. It catches your attention from the beginning and I found it hard to put down. It's one of those books that you will get lost in. I found myself wishing I could call into work so I could finish the book. Yes, it's that good! However, if I'm being completely honest, this book is Fifty Shades of Grey all over again. If I was E.L. James, I would be majorly pissed right now. I know some concepts are duplicated with popular books and I expect this. But I can't help feeling that Bared to You was too similar. Christian Grey and Gideon Cross may as well be the same character. Their similarities are too numerous to count. It's as if Day had a checklist:<br /><br />Sexually Dominant Male - Check<br />Young Twenty Something Billionaire - Check<br />Handsome to the Point of Distraction - Check<br />Possessive, Obsessive and Controlling - Check<br />History of Childhood Abuse - Check<br />Emotionally Unavailable - check<br />Ex-Girl Friend Who Still Loves Him - Check<br />Preference for Brunettes - Check<br />Over Abundance of Steamy Sex Scenes - Check<br /><br />The list could go on and extend to the Heroine as well. I can excuse a few similarities but this almost seems like outright copying. While the dialogue has changed, the formula of the book is very much the same. One reviewer commented that this book is better than Fifty Shades. Well, that's probably because Day had the opportunity to perfect someone else's work. It doesn't seem fair to me on some level. That being said, it was a good book and if you liked Fifty Shades then you will like Bared to You as well.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I really loved this game until I lost all my energy and timer on crops, meds, etc. went crazy! This seems to be the common problem amongst a lot of reviews! Boo! Going to uninstall!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the game but I wish when when I got money from a house I wish it was dollars instead of coins.
B005OK721G|1.0|I just show half hour of it. The screenplay is for laughs, especially when the young heroine as a little girl<br />stabs in the hand the bad guy who murder her parents. The whole film is a joke. Bad ugly actors and the whole<br />thing was to common and multi used cliche. Stay away.
B001M72JC2|4.0|I havent watched it a couple times yet , I'm not sure if its a random alt ending but the ending  isn't the same as the DVD and this one sucked, product was perfect though
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|why the heck does this thing ask u to give your email and email password. I don't want to give that info away. Its probably a good game but seriously.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is like most build a town games but something makes it cool.<br />I would give this game 4 1/2 stars... but that's impossible. so ill round up.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|i just recieved my dvd of Moneyball and it works great, i'm pleased with the service. it came pretty fast to my house and i'm extremely happy
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Fun! Great way to waste time while waiting at the dr, etc! Takes me back, reminds me of Super Mario Bros. Cute! Glad I took the time to download it.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|i just recieved my order and it works great and it got here pretty quick. i'm very pleased with it all
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I love this game but it takes quite a long time to finish loading and I'm a ten year old boy so I recommend this to others but be ready for the download k bye
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Read this for a class on intelligence analysis.  Another great book that shows us that the way we think and perceive the world does not necessarily mesh with reality, and how to overcome it.
B007VPLNGW|1.0|When my grandson tried to play this all it did was freeze up my Kindle Fire. Nothing would work so I had to delete it off my Kindle &amp; return it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The game started off fun, but once you get to about level 23 the game stops working.<br />The premise of the game is to create a new town in the wild frontier of Oregon. You build buildings such as a General Store, Hunting Lodge, etc. Each building generates taxes/revenue every few hours. For instance, a General Store takes 24 hours to produce money. Here now lies the problem. Once you reach a higher level these buildings say they are ready, meaning money is now available, but you cannot collect from them. The game glitches and doesn't allow you a means to collect when it once worked just fine a day or two ago. The only solution is to destroy the building and rebuild it. But some of these buildings cost a lot of money and without the initial funds that building produced there is no way to rebuild.<br /><br />Some other annoying flaws is that people get sick a lot. I, myself, don't waste time healing them because it costs too much; I suggest you do the same. Another annoyance is that natural disasters happen and always seem to stop production on the building that is about to give money, e.g. the General Store takes 24 hours to produce income but once there is only about one hour left a storm comes through and resets production back to 24 hours. This happens to nearly all of my buildings.<br /><br />The Gameloft team, developers of this game, say they are working around the clock. They been sayings that for nearly half a year and nothing has happened yet.<br /><br />I am really happy I didn't spend real money on this game. You have the option to do so, this will allow you to build things faster and get some better perks, but with all of the crashing and glitching it will be real money lost. You're better off spending that money on a lottery ticket.<br /><br />Long story short, if you want to try the game then go ahead, but DO NOT spend a single penny of your real money.

1451648537|5.0|Must read. Isaacson writes in depth and makes reading so easy, and provides the reader 'Geek'or 'layman 'with loads of food to digest. He understands the world of chips and transistors, and memory boards and at the same time gives us  a sensitive portrayal of a troubled genius.<br />no question in my mind, Jobs was a genius.

B0036S4C6G|3.0|Another reader touched on this subject but I was more than surprized that I could not finish reading this novel on my Kindle. The idea of opening up my laptop to finish the novel is ridiculous...Although I felt Egan's writing was clever with great characters I felt it was also jumbled up by its author in order to make it more 'interesting'. I'm sorry I bought it and was not warned by Amazon that reading it on my Kindle would be a real chore and/or impossible. BTW, Pulitzer prize winner?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome.  It's all that has to be said about this series.  I bought the first one because a friend recommended it.  Took about 45 minutes to finish it.  My first thought was OMFG!!!!  No way!!!  I then bought the collected series and have started telling anyone who will listen that they need to check this out.  I can't wait for more!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is no doubt that the sex is fun and hot. That is the good part. I think of this book as Bella and Edward meet Justine by the Marquis de Sade. When I realized this was about domination, I immediately put it down. I had to think long and hard to continue. Because it is really offensive, because of its portrayal of such a weak and pitiful heroine and such a sick hero. But I thought, \\"okay, how is this a best seller? There must be a redemptive quality. She is going to get him to fall in love with her and heal him.\\" So I started reading again.<br /><br />It is well written only in the sex. The rest is very run of the mill. But sex gets pretty boring, even sick sex.<br /><br />But when she liked him spanking her really hard and then screwing her, that was it for me. Why? Because while Bella is irrationally head over heels in love with a vampire, it is not sick. It is a fantasy love story.<br /><br />What Fifty Shades of Grey is - is a man who has justified a really screwed up way to treat women and it is only 6 degrees from the mind of a serial killer who tortures and multilates woman as he rapes them.<br /><br />I can see why people are reading it because the author has very cleverly made us feel great sympathy for Christian. But let us get real. This is merely a very pretty version, with very pretty people, all so rich and panting, of those movies where Freddy and Jason run amuk killing women in their underwear.<br /><br />Have to say I am pretty saddened by this book's success. I don't care how redemptive it becomes, how tortured he was, how much we might come to understand his nature. Basically, it is incredibly demeaning to women and caters to the most immature and vulnerable part within each woman reader.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|A very heart catching movie one of the late PS' best and it is a movie that I believe many will come to regard as one of his greatest.
B000002BE9|5.0|From the moment I saw the cover of this album, I knew I would love it.<br />I have lately been listening to a lot of music. Fiona Apple came up after I mentioned to somebody that I liked Amy Winehouse and Regina Spektor, and I got this recommendation.<br />I looked her up on Wikipedia to do a little background, and what really sold me was the title of When the Pawn...<br />Poetic, but not flowing. I had to download Tidal.<br />Listening to 'Pale September' gave me a feeling... I continued to listen...<br />Shadowboxer was the track that ultimately screamed 'I'm Fiona Apple! This is how I sing!\\"<br />I didn't know that Fiona was only 18 when this was recorded, and I would've pegged her for at least 25.<br />I don't think a single song is repetitive at all. Each song tells a different story.
0399536108|3.0|I read this book for an English class at my university and I was overall not 100% pleased with it. Though it proved to be somewhat more interesting the typical assigned literature, it was also very repetitive and haphazard. The writing was not systematic whatsoever, with thoughts and ideas being all over the place. This lack of organization was probably a contributing factor to Guillebeau stating the similar five or six main concepts repeatedly. Also, the title seems misleading, because in this day and age, isn't non-conforming the new conforming?<br /><br />To be fair, this book's audience was not quite for someone like me. The audience was more for someone older than myself who has been leading a dull lifestyle and is seeking change. Therefore, my opinion may be biased. This book really was not all that terrible, and I enjoyed reading some parts. He also gives a lot of neat tips to save money, which are nice because who doesn't like to save money? Overall, I would say it is an average book for anyone. You might find yourself uninterested after a while, but it definitely is not a waste of time to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I devoured the book in little time once i read the first book i simply HAD to buy the others and read them trust me if you read them you WILL NOT regret it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Perfect! I chose to read it because all my students raved about it. Quick read and a great book. Now I finally know what they are so excited about.
0345803485|5.0|Love the trilogy!  I started reading these books and couldn't put them down.  Once you get past the erotic sex ( which does become less as the relationship grows-third book) you find yourself wanting to know what will happen to the characters. Becarful, once you start reading you may not be able to do anything else! I can't wait to read the next set of books.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Since I grew up on the original Teen Wolf movie with Michael J Fox, and I am completely addicted to The Vampire Diaries, I gave this new series a shot.  I am SO glad I did! THIS SHOW IS GREAT! It has some of the same elements from the original movie (like characters Scott & Styles) but instead of it being a comedy, it's more intense and dark like Vampire Diaries.  Check out this series... it has a great storyline and will keep you entertained!  P.S. Season Two starts up this summer on MTV!!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great album I would highly recommend this album if you like Garth Brooks one of his better albums. Lot of music at a great price!!!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This series pulls you in from the start. While I enjoy The Twilight Saga and that story line, The Vampire Diaries is far more intense with the storyline, the relationships, the action... plus, in addition to vampires and werewolves, you have a 3rd element with witches.  I am completely addicted and block off my Thursday evening every week just for this show.  It's by far my favorite thing to watch on TV. I hope this series continues for many seasons to come!  P.S. I'm in my 30's - so it's not just for teenagers!!  :O)
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Received product on time.<br /><br />The Lume lasts at least 8 hours in dark room at night.  Not as bright at the end, but readable<br /><br />So far the accuracy has been spot on.  It may be shifting a few seconds/day, but I can't tell and it appears to clock exactly with my phone's network time<br /><br />I've seen complaints about the band, but it is very comfortable and seems durable enough for my use. If I am going hunting I'll switch to a NATO band for that.<br /><br />All in all pleased so far
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I don't read much in this genre but this is a great book.  Read it the first time about 20 years back, picked it up again recently and still thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|did someone really just call this a knockoff of sketch with friends? lmao that game sucked balls. as far as I'm concerned,  this is 100x better.
B002BJCNLW|5.0|really no insert!!!..., Jo, in fact too no information about the band and it's history and impact on the back cover or anywhere else..., incredible to be THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE. My comfort, if correct, there are only 2000 copies over the world, I have the 1751/2000 ...

159514188X|4.0|This book was great. Honestly, it was well written with a great plot and loads of tragedy. Hannah's story was amazing to listen to, and the whole thing fell together perfectly and made her suicide make sense in a very painful way. The author did an amazing job of making all of these little things that wouldn't matter on their own add up to something huge and awful. But as tragic as the book was, somehow most of it failed to make me feel emotional. I didn't cry, and when I compare the tragedy in this book to that of other books I've read and cried from, 13 Reasons Why wins. It's not that it's done badly either, because it wasn't. There were maybe three things that made me really sad in this book, and they were fairly small. For example, the part about the paper bags of notes in one of Hannah's classes and hers being stolen, that completely shattered me. But major things like the last tape, they kind of just didn't faze me. Now that I think about it more, I think it amy have been that I wasn't emotionally invested in the characters. It wasn't a glaring thing, but when I really think about it, the characters did kind of fall flat.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought it was a good book. It's pretty great for a teen book despite the premise of children killing children because some people might not find that to be a good read. It displays the idea of a totalitarian nation well enough. I only got interested in reading it after the movie. Had no choice really since the movie left out so much that you if you weren't already familiar with the finer details you were left wondering how everything fit together.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is not a bad little game. Fun and entertaining. Try it out. It's free so I tried it and now, I'm glad I did.
B00785P2QC|5.0|so much fun. I play it all the time. my brothers and sister play it all the time too. we love it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so addicting. Great game for adults and kids. I would definitely recommend this game for everyone, but especially for User of the Kindle Fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very easy to use and is so much fun! It is very addicting ; you wont be able to stop!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this entire series...it was well written...and a great story..sad when it ended..I loaned them to my niece and she read them as quick as I did. They are descriptive enough to give you a picture without excess detail..Great story.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I like it I can do my things it is awesome I will use it every da I will I will.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Great read, great characters.. but dont read too many of the reviews regarding the storyline, as I couple do give it away a little - but a must read!!!
B000EWD1KK|5.0|Once you get past the subtitles (unless you manually turn them off, they'll begin with Korean subtitles), you realize that they just don't make movies like this anymore. Danny Kaye gives a brilliant performance (many scenes, like the one where he sings a song about the band instrumentation, are only done in one camera take), and a great supporting cast (the lovely Virginia Mayo, sinister Boris Karloff, and always amusing Fay Bainter) make for a wonderful film.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This very addictive and fun.  I play this all the time.<br /> I let my little nephews play it when they are bored.
B001F290E4|5.0|Song selection for this CD was great. As usual Seal touch was very impressive. His voice blended with the music,
B000R209NY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie over the Original Poseidon it was really cool and action packed I might add.the storyline was good to and the Special Effects were great the ship was AWESOME!and so was the original ship used for the movie but I would choose this movie over the original anytime cause its soo! much better.I rate this movie 10 stars.also I only wish they would make more movies with ship disasters that happened in the past like during WWII.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to come to the kindle market.  I have played it on my ipod and fell in love with it. This game is super addictive!!!!
B005V1WZ10|1.0|So much for a good listen. At least we can recycle plastic now days so I don't have to worry about dropping this in the land fill?
B007V2UGPE|5.0|An amazing addicting game. Take place in a deadly adventure to kill the zombies. If you don't they will eat you and your village.
1594203059|4.0|Civilization, by Niall Ferguson, explains the ascendance of the Western world over the past 500 years.  This was a very interesting and informative book.  I really enjoyed it.

B0076NKNLA|4.0|My daughter and I watched \\"My Week With Marilyn\\"[[ASIN:B0076NKNLA My Week With Marilyn]] on Instant Video. We enjoyed the movie.  The fact that Marilyn had self-esteem problems has been documented in books and was presented in this movie visibly.  Of course Laurence Olivier could likely make anyone have self doubts.  At least in this movie he comes across as a first class horse's butt.  The movie centers around the filming of a movie starring Marilyn and Laurence that was finally named \\"the Prince and the Show Girl\\" although I don't believe that title was ever mentioned in this movie.  The primary action however was not the filming of the movie. It was about the problems trying to get Marilyn to participate in the filming as a result of Laurence's belligerent attitude and about the time she spent with the assistant to the assistant director, an Englishman, who was assigned to take care of her needs during her stay in England.  If you are looking for a romantic episode in this arrangement, you will be disappointed.  However you do get to see a \\"skinny dipping\\" episode when Marilyn decides to cool off during a walk and her host has to follow suite.  All-in-all not a great movie but a good one.
B002OT731E|5.0|Call me crazy but...<br /><br />This album was released in 1995 way before SHINE A LIGHT the movie came out, right?<br /><br />And 20 years after Exile on Main Street came out, it was still underrated, as it seems like only after the Scocese movie did Exile seem to get some notice, and still today only real Stones fans know it well...<br /><br />My point is that only serious Stones fans back in 1995 would know any song from Exile other than Happy and Tumbling Dice...<br /><br />So on TRACK #4, after pretty much the first piano note, almost at once, the crowd at this concert roared, knowing it was Shine a Light!  How could this be?  The answer?  Everyone there had to have been serious Stones fans, and were fortunate to be a part of it...<br /><br />So if nothing else, get track #4 if you are a Stones Fan, goosebumps!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I am a hiker and actually climbed Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the lower 48 states a few years ago.  Last summer, I spent 4 nights on a mother-son camping-kayaking trip on a remote, uninhabited island in Lake Michigan.  Modern amenities not included!  I can appreciate the rough, outdoor adventure.  Perhaps it is the reason I enjoyed Wild:  From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  It is the memoir of Cheryl Stayed, who at the young age of 26, brave or impulsive, hiked solo a 1000 mile stretch of the PCT.  Unprepared physically, she was over loaded with a backpack, called Monster, with hiking boots a size too small.  From the Mojave Desert, through Oregon, ending at the Bridge of the Gods in Washington, it is a journey of self-discovery, healing, faith, and personal power - the pilgrim way on the PCT.  Wild?  Yes!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is the best calendar. Very easy to use and manage. Easy to connect with your Google calendar account. Definitely recommend this app.

0345803485|5.0|I have never before read an \\"erotic novel\\" so I have nothing to compare it to. Despite the horrible reviews this book is getting, I thought this book was charming with an edge. I have purchased the next two and look forward to reading them.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i got this on my phone and ipod then i waited FOREVER. and FINALLY it is here!!!!!!!! I love it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book filled with adventure and a little romance. I always like to read the book before seeing the movie. The two were very much alike. I recommend both to everyone.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Watch this movie all the way through and it is pretty good. Setting changes up (a real multi-site shoot.) a lot and it is more of a character driven movie. A little over the top but it proves that though you may be aging you can still be cinematically relevant.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is a comedy before anything else. Very good acting. I could not stop laughing. I watched it twice in less than a week!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I played on the iphone for two months. I am so glad it is now on the Kindle! this game is super fun and addictive.
B000002G7E|5.0|Whenever I listen to The Velvet Underground I'm not entirely certain that I get it.  By this, I mean that if I had never heard of this band would I even give it the time of day?  I frequently think this whenever I read books or watch movies that are well reviewed as well.  Do I really like what I am listening to or seeing, or do I just like what the piece of art has been portrayed as through critics and the media.<br />I try my best to give all types of music a fair shake because it's important to be open minded about these sorts of things.  Whether it is rap, jazz, hardcore metal music, etc. I believe every kind of music has something to offer, and it's important to at least try listening.<br />What does this have to do with the infamous White Light/White Heat?  Well, at first listen this is probably one of the ugliest pieces of noise to ever attack your ears.  To steal a quote from Wikipedia (I know not the best source), John Cale said of this album, \\"a very rabid record...The first one had some gentility, some beauty. The second one was consciously anti-beauty.\\"<br />My girlfriend, whom I subject to all the music I test out, said that the music on this record is brutal.  Not in a good way either.  And maybe it is brutal, not only in it's sonic power (there is plenty of energy to spare if nothing else), but also in how difficult it can be to handle.  The guitars scream, Loud Reed howls vulgarities and nonsensical lyrics, and the band in general seems intent on playing jam band music from hell.  The album isn't so much a listening experience as it is a violent, noisy ordeal that may cause you a massive migraine.<br />So why would I give it five stars?  Because I keep coming back to it.  I get tired of typical pop music and the instant gratification that most songs give listeners in this day and age.  The first time I listened to it I didn't understand it.  The second time I was intrigued (I know how pretentious that sounds but it's true).  The third time I loved it.  Now, this brand of music permeates my thoughts whenever I check out new bands.  Simply put, it has me in its grip.<br />This doesn't even mention the fact that it's a rock record that laid the foundation for punk rock and everything that followed afterwards.  Is that to say punk rock never would have come about without this album? Certainly not.  But this band had the foresight to plant the seeds for that type of music and many musicians such as Henry Rollins cite it as a major influence.<br />So maybe I wouldn't have given this album a second listen had I not heard about the band beforehand.  However, I wouldn't have heard about the band if they didn't pave the way for much of the rock music that followed after it.<br />So, I suggest that if you get the opportunity, sit down, maybe pour yourself a glass of wine (or something rougher), and play this album from start to finish (preferably on vinyl).  But be forewarned, it is a harrowing experience upon first listen.  Then after you have finished, let your opinion sit for a couple of days and don't touch it again.  Then listen to it again.  Then, listen to it once more after that.  If you don't like it after that you may not ever like it.  But this is an album that, like a fire, needs a chance to breathe.  And if you let it do so, you might find yourself getting hooked into its mania.  It has certainly made an impression on me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading The Hunger Games Trilogy. The second book was by far my favorite, but all were great. I hadn't read any reviews before I started the series, and I was pleasantly surprised by the disutopian feel of the series. Although it is suitable for young adults, it definitely has themes that all ages can appreciate. I finished the last book about two weeks ago, and I still think of Katniss and her story often.
B0064BCNA4|5.0|Well, integrated lessons! Yeah, can't wait to have this on a tablet for my toddler. She should have one by the end of the December and I hope to have a Note by then. Would love to see how this looks on a higher def screen. Great and fun little app.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game and I am so happy that I can now get it on my Kindle Fire!  Thank you!
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought these headphones for myself for Christmas and I have been very happy with these headphones. I have not made any adjustments to them and they work wonderfully! My only complaint is that if you wear the headphones on too long they tend to press on your head and give me headaches, that could just be me but other than that they are great headphones! A good buy for anyone!!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|this is just a rip off of sketch with friends, no one plays it and its boring. seriously don't waste your time.
B004WR125O|5.0|Great product!  Easy to use.  Just connected it to my Onkyo 509 receiver and then immediately signed onto Pandora and Sirius through my wireless router.  Love it.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|One of the best series ever brought out. I am a zombie flick lover and when I heard about this a couple years ago I went crazy.<br />Good story great replayability never gets old. I would recomend this to everyone and have. Lots of my friends are just as adicted to thid sd I am must buy gor everyone.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I find this remote control software to work as advertised but am pleasantly surprised at how well the mouse control and keyboard functions work in controlling the remote laptop.  I am very well satisfied with it so far.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|The movie is brilliant and the young boy cast to play in the film is a remarkable actor. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys first rate cinema.
B007BVJZ0C|5.0|The show is very well made.  Think LotR costume/production but TV Series.  The immersion factor is high and when the episode is over I want more. *thumbs up*
0061438294|4.0|I learned quite a bit more from this book than I expected to. It's one I ended up buying, and I think it has helped me at work.
0345803485|1.0|The writing is terrible.  Given all the five-star reviews, one has to wonder whether those readers would know good writing if they saw it.  I've seen 14 year olds write tighter prose than this.  Sad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If I had not seen the coming attraction for the movie \\"The Hunger Games\\", I would never had heard about the books.  I, personally, prefer the books to the movies, but love to see the movies afterwards (in hopes that they do the books justice).  I was not totally sure if this would be my style, but I was drawn in from the beginning.  I am now almost finished with the second book of the trilogy, and already purchased the third one on my Kindle.<br /><br />I still have not seen the movie, but I hope to catch it before it's out of the theatres.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is AMAZING. Ive been waiting for this for ever. FINALLY!!!!!!!!! yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this understanding that it was originally a Fan Fiction written by a housewife, which I actually kind of respected because it's a pretty awesome success story. What I didn't bargain for, however, was exactly how terribly it was written. If a Harlequin Romance novel and Twilight had a torrid one night stand, this abomination would be the result. Other than the character's names and ages, it is the EXACT same story as Twilight, of course replacing anything supernatural with some kinky S&M fetish.<br /><br />I'm not against romance novels, or even erotic novels, but I am against reading disturbingly graphic garbage written at a 4th grade reading level. Seriously, if the author is going to go into detail about a guy ripping out a girl's tampon to have sex with her, perhaps she could get more creative than constantly talking about all the \\"feelings down there.\\"<br />Also, tackling women's liberation by talking about the \\"beaming inner goddess\\" may be better served with a character who doesn't sacrifice every ounce of her self-esteem for a man who wants to beat her with a riding crop, but won't let her look at him.<br /><br />Long story short, don't waste your money. If you want a good read, I would recommend just about anything else. If you want something smutty, I'm pretty sure most of the Harlequin novels are free on Kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to see what the hype was around this series, and I was thoroughly impressed, had a good stoy line, and made me want to keep reading, I bought them all and they are all great
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game. It's fun and easy. If I win the game my son will try to beat my score.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love it! It's cool! it's awesome!I'm dabird44 saying I love this game and angry birds! Favorote bird: da yellow bird!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|My expectations remained just that, expectations. Did not enjoy the book. I would have prefered to see the book continue in the same way as the rest of the books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a wonderful app to get...I play it all the time because there is Soooo much games you can play...if u normally have nothing to do or u just have some free time on your hands I would recommend getting this app
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Well made and very attractive. Nice rubber exterior adds protection while also resisting scratches and spills. Well worth the price.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|yay!!!!! love this game!!! now all we need is temple run and jet pack joy ride!!! all in favor say &quot;aye!&quot; the &quot;ayes&quot; have it!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book left me wanting more, not in the usual way. I wanted the story to begin, it had plenty of sex but I wanted more from the story line. Ana was so innocent, but if she was my friend I would say \\"what the hell are you thinking?\\" I won't buy the next books in the series and I suggest you don't buy the first.
B006ON41FC|4.0|openfient can get your personal information In the games that they sponsor when you're offline it is annoyingas hell. they need to stop openfient from doing this.
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book!!! Couldn't put it down. I will read more of Suzanne Collins books but don't see how she can top this series.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|not a crape imitator the real deal it is awesome I highly suggest you are missing out if you don't have it
1594202842|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library bc after everything I'd read about it, I wasn't going to spend money on it - everything was so negative, but the attention did leave me curious. I just finished it (only took a day - very easy read) and I am more confused than ever by the media coverage. Honestly, her parenting style seems a little overbearing and intense but that's really just her personality. What she struggles with is figuring out when she should listen to her daughters bc they know what's best for themselves and when she is responsible for making those decisions and taking the initiative and making sure her daughters have every opportunity to succeed in life as a result. I think it's the same struggle all good parents go through. If anything, she's quite self-effacing and humble (although not in so many words, at least not before the end of the book) about how she didn't know everything but tried as hard as she could and in the best way she knew. It's actually a beautiful story about the growth parents go through while raising their children and it's told in a funny and entertaining way.<br /><br />Great book - complete media misrepresent. Definitely recommend reading it.
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|Really enjoy the movie, however beware if you are purchasing for the digital version. I have had nothing but issues and have learned that it is not compatible with an iPhone / iPad / iTouch. Perhaps this is common knowledge, but after several emails with customer service with Sony, I unfortunately am going to end up purchasing a digital copy of movie again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not many great games I was hoping for something a little bit better. the games were a little boring and they just get tiring after a while.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie first...both of my daughters, 36 and 45, thoroughly enjoyed the books; so in spite of the fact that they were aimed at mid to late teen (girls?), I decided to try the books.<br />I am a 71 year old man and started reading SF when I was eight (late 1940's). I found these to be well written and entertaining. The first book was adapted fairly well in the movie and I look forward to seeing the follow-ons.<br />Using the Kindle has been a little strange because I like the feel of a book in hand but I am getting used to it.
0446572993|3.0|Am a big fan of Baldacci and love this new character - Will Robie - an assassin with a conscience. If you are a fan of assassins, I highly recommend Barry Eisler's John Rain books. They are superb. This one began as a real page turner; I was captured from the first page and could not put this book down. Where it fell apart for me, however, was the wrap up phase. I could not imagine how the author was going to tie these seemingly unconnectable events and couldn't wait to be amazed. What happened, however, was that (without spoiling it for you) is that to me the way it was wrapped up was not believable. Go ahead and read it; maybe it was just me. I think it jumped the shark.
B000UPC78S|4.0|Not his best of his line of work. However, Dan Brown is very good at telling stories and letting you get involved with the plot.
B00740FMTS|5.0|This book does an immense amount to flesh out the back story of bioshock. Reading this book makes you feel as though the creation of rapture is historical fact, such is the authors skill for immersing you in the world. It almost requires a replay of the game it is based on in order to feel the shock of picking up a reference to a character you now understand in depth. Seeing the world of rapture before the fall...it makes the game intensely impactful.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It might be fun if we could PLAY the dang thing. Maybe we'll give it a while and try again.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really loved this book!!! No skimming with this one.  I do hope there will be more of this character!! He is a winner!!! I really found very little to criticize here and much to applaud.  I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't say more.  One Warning!! Once you start reading you won't want to stop!!!<br /><br />Having said all that good stuff, I have a complaint that is really bothering me.  I pre-ordered this book at $14.99, to be delivered to my Kindle on April 17th.  It came on that date and then I saw on the book description page that it was not currently available.  Then, I saw it available for pre-order on April 26th.  Now it is being offered for #11.99.  How weird is that/  I know all about the disputes going on between book publishers and Amazon, however, why am I being ripped off?  As a customer who literally spens thousands of dollars a year on Amazon merchandise, I don't know why I am deserving of such treatment.  I will be watching very carefully.  I always thought pre-ordering was great, now I am not so sure. I deserve to be refunded three bucks, which should have been automatic when the price changed  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|i really enjoy this game. its fun but you dont have control over your character's attacks it just auto attacks.
0446547654|3.0|If you like Nicholas Sparks, you'll like this book. But honestly, his writing seems so formulaic and predictable to me these days that it's hard for me to like.<br /><br />I'd like to see writers like him believe in \\"happily ever after\\" occasionally instead of \\"It's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.\\"<br /><br />Maybe passion and love and a decent relationship *can* last more than a weekend and we don't have to kill off people just when they find true love to keep them from screwing it up. Just maybe, for once.<br /><br />It was entertaining, despite being so predictable. A few scenes made me a little misty-eyed, even though I saw it coming. Just a summer romance, a good beach read. I read the whole book in one day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So much better than Twilight if you are twi-hard fan. A lot of good details about their BDSM. I love it! Read it over 5 times. Couldn't get enough of it. I also read the second and third books (50 Shades Darker & 50 Shades Freed).

B00127RAJY|5.0|I began this as a beginner, no coordination, no endurance, no nothing (double negative intended). Day 1/Level 1 I could barely make it through half the work out, and never mind the bicycles at the end. I worked out 2 days, then major muscle aches set in for two days, then I worked out one more day to finish out the week. Through the next 3 weeks (averaging 4 workouts per week), my stamina doubled, I noticed increased muscle definition in my arms and abs, and I was able to get through the entire Level 1 workout without stopping. Thought I was hot stuff. Ha.<br /><br />Level 2: \\"If you think you're going to die\\"...Jillian's favorite catch phrase caught up with me. (I'm writing this at the end of my first Level 2 session). I could not make it without several \\"5 second\\" pauses throughout the workout. New moves, higher intensity, and increased resistance had me sweating twice as much and breathing three times as hard. I really liked it. I can't want to be able to get through this level.<br /><br />Comments on Jillian as a trainer: She's incredible, she'll push and challenge you throughout circuit. She's funny and doesn't take herself too seriously when it comes to stretching, but her workout is no joke. Her girls Natalie and Anita were huffing and puffing along with me! My single complaint is that the stretching segment isn't long enough. I guess trying to fit everything into a 20 minute time frame is tough, but I wish it was longer. I ended up taking a couple extra minutes for more stretching.<br /><br />Health issues: I have recurring knee problems and had to modify the cardio portion, jump rope and butt kicks, alternating legs instead of jumping on both, to minimize impact on my knees. I like that she does a knee warmup in the beginning of Level One. Working out has improved my knee problems greatly, but I still stay safe and decrease impact without minimizing my workout.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie is a classic. Love the kid adventure and the family feelings, good movie i wil watch again very soon.
B007ORU2BY|5.0|Love downloading Mad Men the day after it airs--it's much better than cable. And I can watch the shows whenever I want, because I own them!
B0017QQZOQ|5.0|This is a review of the entire show. Spoilers contained within.<br /><br />This series is simply amazing. New characters are introduced every season, and the show only gets better and better until the end. One might be worried that the Tudors would get stale with 6 different wives to choose from; fear not - the show has so many different aspects that you will not get bored. From politics at Court to war, from love to death, from King Henry's outrageous temper to the political machinations of those around him, the show does not fail to surprise.<br /><br />The 6 wives are often known through the refrain of \\"divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived\\" and the show details each and every aspect of that fun. Queen Catherine of Aragon is spanish and refuses to give up on her role, ultimately dying without any closure. Queen Anne is a wanton lascivious woman who schemes to get her desires. We dont learn too much of Jane Seymour, except she has the king's only son. Anne of Cleves is described as horseface yet is not unattractive, but the King divorces her anyway and keeps her on as a close friend. Catherine Howard is young and sleeps around with his chamberman, and ends up getting beheaded for her sins. Finally, Catherine Parr, who you may recognize as Joely Richardson from Nip/Tuck on Fx, ends up with the most longevity and survives despite some scares due to her religious beliefs.<br /><br />Religion is discussed at length here, and the King's views change over time, but his penchance for blood and gore rule out. Many people are sent to the tower, burned, beheaded, dragged through town, or simply executed for whatever reason the King chooses. Some are as simple as not acting \\"lordly\\" while others are schemers or trying to subvert the King's chosen religion. Political intrigue also plays a very large part, with many players trying to get their own goals achieved or pushing their ambitions to the King.<br /><br />The scenery is lush, with many outdoor scenes shot showing the King's grounds, foreign countries, and English countrysides. The clothing appears to be indicative of the times and much thought has gone into this. The people are well-suited for their roles and I rarely had any complaints that an actor under or over-acted their lines.<br /><br />It's a fun show. I truly enjoyed it and wished there was more!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app to have.  super easy and u can save locations for those of us that like to travel

0345803485|1.0|This was, without a doubt, the worst written book I have ever had in my hands.  Never in my life have I hated the character within the first 12 pages of opening a book.  Anastasia is going to stand in for her sick friend Kate and go interview a man she's never met.  She begins cursing Kate because she failed to give her a brief biography of this man.  She knows nothing about him; he could be 90 or he could be 30.  Well, how about opening your mouth and asking some questions!  What kind of twit would just go off and interview such a wealthy business man without at least some knowledge of WHY she was going there?  Absurd!  I am totally disappointed because I was expecting this to be a great read and it was nothing but amateurish drivel. I have never in my life returned a book and wanted a refund for it, but I am with this.  I wish I'd investigated this book and read reviews about it like I usually do, even though a lot of times I disagree with the bad reviews and end up loving the book.  Not this time.  The bad reviews are spot on!<br /><br />The last series I read was the Highlander books by Karen Marie Moning.  She has superb writing skills.  Reading E L James' book was like reading an immature teenage girls diary.  This might be one of those times when the movie, if one is actually made, is better than the book.  Let us hope so!
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|Boardwalk Empire is a brilliantly-produced, profane, misogynistic and at times incredibly brutal TV show. True to HBO standards, most episodes include at least one instance of mind-shattering violence (see a particularly explosive headshot in the first episode) and graphic sexuality. Beyond these adult-TV 'staples,' the show is filled to the brim with freakishly good entertainment. The environments are marvelously detailed. The boardwalk sizzles with seedy glitz and depth. The costumes, from gangster suits to flapper dresses, are period appropriate and striking. The actors are supremely talented, save Steve Buscemi who more or less sticks out like a sore thumb. He possesses little of the grit or dirty fervor we might expect from a name like Nucky. Still, he is off-set by the electric Michael Pitt and the very talented Kelly McDonald whose temperance movement widow performance is one of the best female leads in recent memory (and the show's only female lead of note, providing the only empathetic center for progressive audience members...and women in general). Michael Shannon is also excellent, playing the role he always plays: the stoic, frightening creep! Only this time he wears a fedora and searches for boozers wherever they may dwell. He performs an interrogation at one point that makes 24's Jack Bauer tame by comparison. For anyone interesting in prohibition era gangster culture and not turned off by violence, profanity and a good bit of Non-PC dialogue/situations (including a few nasty 'dwarf' boxing matches and lots of derogatory language toward ladies), this is one show you ought not miss. It hits every historical note right on the head with bloody glory.
B000002L9Y|2.0|This is the last album from the classic Fleetwood Mac lineup, but this is not classic Fleetwood Mac, hit singles and multi-platinum status notwithstanding.<br /><br />  The album maintains a plucky pulse throughout, with good technical sound aspects, yet the album lacks inspiration and heart, which is hard to forgive of the band that created Rumours.  The end result isn't offensively bad, just disappointing: puddle-deep lyrics, lukewarm melody, and a noticeable absence of Stevie Nicks.  P.S: isn't \\"Family Man\\" already a similar, yet far superior Hall and Oates song?<br /><br />  There are no surprises here.  I would recommend this album to completionists only.  My only conceivable explanation for all of the gushing reviews on this page, is that these fans must have followed the band chronologically, and invested so much into their good music, that now the idealized Fleetwood Mac can do no wrong.  \\"Little Lies\\" is the absolute high-water mark, if that is any indication.  So unless that song completely knocks your socks off, and you thought that 80's Heart was too heavy, and you wonder why the 23-year-old playing at the hotel bar doesn't know any Jackson Browne, then quietly pass over this forgettable album.

B00007KGCW|5.0|A friend had been looking for 'Finding Nemo' for several weeks, to send to her grandson along with some cute little 'Nemo' items for a sort of theme gift.  After at least a dozen fruitless forays into various video stores and retail establishments I said:<br /><br />'Look Karrie, everything I ever want I find on Amazon, let me try that and stop all this running around, I enjoy shoppin occasionally but this is ridiculous.'<br /><br />Being frustrated with the search she agreed.  I came home, got on Amazon, found the DVD and purchased it (at less than the prices we had been told by the video stores to order it).  It arrived in 4 days (quicker than promised), I gave it to Karrie who sent it off with her little treasure chest of Nemo items to 5 year old Braden. Later we heard that he loved it, his dad and mom loved it...and we managed to get it to him just before his birthday.<br /><br />Mission accomplished...it was great!

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This has to be the shadiest form of advertising I ever seen.  I realize that free apps generally come with some levels of ads, but it's usually a third party trying to promote a different product (a sponsor).  I have no problem with this.  Instead, this app continually advertises the pay version of it's own product.  Furthermore, the ads are much longer than usual.  They should just come out and say &quot;pay us, and we'll stop annoying you&quot;.  They won't get a dime from me, and I hope others follow suit.  This is not a good precedence for apps.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had to read the book myself to see what all the fuss was about.  I found their relationship very interesting and thats what kept me reading the book.

B000BB14YY|5.0|Watching an Akira Kurosawa picture isn't just a cause for celebration; it's an event to dwarf the summer blockbusters. Rarely has a filmmaker created such a distinctive and mesmerizing body of work that leaves an enormous impression on the first viewing and then yields multiple rewards on the ones after. Rather he's doing samurai epics (Seven Samurai; The Hidden Fortress; Throne of Blood; the Sanjuro movies), non-linear melodramas (Rashomon; Ikiru), pot-boiling crime thrillers (Stray Dog; High and Low) or even a mosaic (Dodes'ka-den), Kurosawa is a league above a million leagues. Yet when you consider the amount of great movies he has made since the 1940's, one has to ask: what is the ultimate Akira Kurosawa movie? What is the one that represents the apex of his creative powers and the culmination of his entire work?<br /><br />That, ladies and gentlemen, would be Ran (1985).<br /><br />In addition to being his fourth movie shot in color (you don't know visual beauty until you watched this!), Ran is Akira Kurosawa's third interpretation of a William Shakespeare play (Throne of Blood and The Bad Sleeps Well re-interpret Macbeth and Hamlet respectively). In this case, it is King Lear that gets the Kurosawa treatment. Kurosawa brings Lear into the sixteenth century, replacing three daughters with three sons and turning the play into an epic metaphor of nuclear warfare, senseless violence and humanity's inability to coexist. In contrast to many Kurosawa's movies, Ran offers no respite to anyone. The most sympathetic ones (Sue, Tsurumaru) suffer at the hands of their tormentors; the main characters (the three sons and their father) devour themselves like snakes swallowing their own tails and an act of redemption becomes obsolete. There are no heroes in Ran; only creators and victims of their own brutality.<br /><br />Ran may also be read as Akira Kurosawa's reactionary attitude towards the samurai genre that he helped popularize during the 1950-1960's, the period where Japanese cinema was at its peak. The best way to illustrate this is to compare Ran to that other quintessential samurai epic by Kurosawa, Seven Samurai (1954). As Michael Wilmington of Chicago Tribune points out, Seven Samurai is \\"robust, earthy, and full of lusty humor, excitement and emotion\\": the work of a director at his prime.<br /><br />Fast forward 31 years later to Ran and the effect and style is considerably different. Ran, made at the late age of Kurosawa's career, is a beautiful tapestry of expressive colors and painterly compositions, yet the humor and energy of Seven Samurai is replaced by a colder, more nihilistic outlook on humanity. When the Seven Samurai and the villagers steamrolled through the bandits, it is directed with excitement and vigor. When the combined forces of Jiro and Taro completely annihilate Saburo's Castle, the effect is more horrific than enthralling. In a startling directional move, Kurosawa has this destruction shot in silence, with only the mournful music played in the background. This amazing battle scene, which was a clear influence on the battle scenes from Braveheart (1995), Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), captures the horror of violence as we viewers sit passively to observe the carnage, rather than revel in it. Samurai epics are meant to please members of the bloodlust and yet in this movie, like Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri (1962), Kurosawa turns the genre on its head by showing the senseless carnage inflicted on human beings by human beings; a terrible cycle of violence that never ends.<br /><br />Kurosawa's masterful skill in cinematography, action choreography and visual storytelling is matched by the excellent acting from his cast. Tatsuya Nakadai is appropriately theatrical as the crazed old emperor Hidetora, who arrogantly decides to give control of his empire to his three sons, not only underestimating their own personal greed and taste for power but foolishly assuming that anew generation will rule in peace, particularly after the bloodshed that he himself has caused. Masayuku Yui is excellent as Tango, Hidetora's bodyguard who is as close of an empathic character as audiences are going to get in such a nihilistic picture; and Akira Terao, Jinpachi Nezu and Daisuke Ryu are tremendous as the three sons, showing their selfishness, greed, obsession for power and, in Ryu's case, an attempt to bring sanity and logic to an utterly inhuman scenario that, in the end, cannot be resolved.<br /><br />But the real star in Ran is Mieko Harada as the Lady Kaede, the villainous mistress who plunges everyone into hell. When she seduces and manipulates Jiro into murdering Jiro's wife, Harada makes Lady Macbeth look like Mary Poppins in her treachery and wickedness. Like a hideous stepdaughter of Regan, Cruella De Vil, Maleficent and Lady Macbeth, Harada's Lady Kaede is a horrifying creation. Harada is, for lack of a better term, riveting.<br /><br />Ran is easily Kurosawa's most personal picture; his blood and fingerprints are all over Ran, from the opening boar scene that sets the theme of the picture to the spectacular painterly compositions, and finally, Tango's dramatic final speech about how humans continue to destroy each other while the Gods above can do nothing but observe in sadness. The ending where Tsurumaru stands on the edge speaks volumes on how humanity is on the verge of extinction through modern warfare and an impending apocalypse that is just around the corner. There is nothing superficial about Ran; this is not the woodcutter deciding to adopt an orphan child in Rashomon (1950). This is the real deal, straight from the heart.<br /><br />Kurosawa might have made bigger and more influential pictures than Ran but he never made one better.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation.<br /><br />P.S. It is with great sadness that Criterion lost DVD rights to Ran. Instead, you'll have to make due with the Lionsgate Blu-Ray. But if you do find a Criterion DVD edition, do not hesitant to buy it. There is an assortment of extras, which include Chris Marker shooting a documentary with Kurosawa and Sidney Lumet talking about his love for the movie. It may cost a fortune but it's money well spent on such a cinematic treasure by one of great directors of all time.new generation will rule in peace, particularly after the bloodshed that he himself has caused.

030758836X|4.0|It's difficult to review a book of this nature in any type of fine detail - there's the risk of giving away some of the finely woven plot.  Suffice to say, fans of Gillian Flynn's first two books ([[ASIN:0307341577 Dark Places: A Novel]] and the sublime [[ASIN:0307341550 Sharp Objects: A Novel]]) won't be disappointed.  Flynn started out as a television critic for Entertainment Weekly.  In that role, she no doubt saw a lot of what worked...and a lot of what didn't.  Her novels combine that knowledge base with her superb writing skills.<br /><br />Flynn divides this new work into three parts - Boy Loses Girl, Boy Meets Girl, Boy Gets girl Back (or Vice Versa) - each of which serves to tear asunder everything you thought you knew until that point.  Given her EW background, the dark, sharp nature of Flynn's initial efforts took everyone by surprise (note how well-named those first two books are).  'Gone Girl' has those same hallmarks. It's a worthy successor to her first two releases.

B001CMOH6S|2.0|Labyrinth was Jim Henson's response to the commercial failure of Dark Crystal. Where Dark Crystal took itself too seriously, Labyrinth goes to the opposite extreme and doesn't even bother with a serious plot. There's no attempt at building a fantasy world in Labyrinth, a morally sophisticated plot, or developing complex characters. It's simply Jennifer Connelly going though a maze with a bunch of puppets in order to find her little brother. Unfortunately, that just wasn't enough to hold my interest. While I love the use of puppets and think they can bring much more life to characters than CGI, the characters in Labyrinth just don't have much meat to them. Also, the puppets look goofy, especially the dwarf with the stiff plastic face. Worst of all, the Goblin King is played by David Bowie, who not only doesn't come across as a goblin king, but even performs a musical number. In the end, I'm just not sure what Labyrinth was going for. 30 years on, Dark Crystal seems like the more ambitious and satisfying effort.
B004DNWPY4|3.0|This book was supposed to be updated.  It wasn't, the examples and stats were years, if not decades old.  Disappointing read.
B007R12TNQ|4.0|Where the first Chipmunks movie was cute, I never really saw it as a multi-film franchise. Lo and behold, we're already at film three. Overall, Chipwrecked shows that there's still some life to the franchise, although probably not enough for a fourth movie. On the one hand, the Chipmunks themselves were as funny as ever. We actually see the characters develop and begin to poke fun at their stereotypes. I particularly loved how Simon went \\"nuts\\" and transformed into a French Rambo. The flirtation between Simon and Jeannette was adorable.<br /><br />The human actors did disappoint. Dave is Dave and was fine for the most part. Ian returns wearing a funny pelican suit. Still, I feel like the writers didn't really squeeze out all of the humor they could have gotten out of that character (although his speech near the end was classic). The big disappointment was Zoey, Zoey is a new character, a castaway stuck on the island where the Chipmunks land. Aside from a few funny references to Tom Hanks' movie Cast Away - including sports balls with eyes and mouths - her character just doesn't add a whole lot to the movie. She seems awkward and out of place at times. At times, I kept wishing she would go away so the camera could focus on the Chipmunks. Fortunately, despite my complaints, she's actually not in too much of the movie, but it still would have been better to either make her do something important, make her funny, or make her go away.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm glad we got Chipmunks 3. If there's another one, I think it'll really have to focus on the Chipmunks and their humor, and leave the humans out of it.

I have the originals on VHS...I'll just copy them to DVD and be done with it. It would be nice to have a blu-ray disc, but it's not worth it if you won't give us what we crave. Bring back the original version of these beloved movies. Your fans are screaming, can't you hear us???!!!???!!!

1594744769|4.0|I'd seen this book around, then my favorite author and nerdfighter John Green recommended it in his blog and I decided to pick it up. It was not what I expected at all! Great story about a 16 year old boy who goes on a journey across seas to discover his grandfather's past mysteries. The bits of humor and magic really made it different and exciting. I personally loved the writing style. Did not disappoint.

0449008738|3.0|One of the most successful hedge funds in the world has run into some trouble.  Its owner, the reclusive computer programming genius Alex Hoffmann, woke to find an intruder in his home, and seems to be at the center of a vast conspiracy designed for some unknown purpose to bring chaos into his life.  He, his wife, his business partner, and the workaday policeman investigating the break-in feel things must have to do with Hoffmann's hedge fund and its alchemical algorithm whose lightning-fast trades seem to spin gold from the electronic aether.<br /><br />A few thoughts:<br /><br />  - At the heart of it, a thriller about an algorithmic hedge fund seems pretty dull, but Harris does an excellent job working in the confined spaces of Geneva and the Internet.  The story is plausible and thus pretty scary, thus fitting all the necessary conditions for a good thriller.<br />  - The characters aren't very deep -- each has his/her own facet in the shape of the story.  Reading other reviews of the book, I see that people are really disappointed in this aspect of it, but it didn't bother me much because I've not read Harris' other work (which people seem to like a lot more).  I will say, though, that I really liked the segments in which Hoffmann, who it turns out has had a turbulent psychological past, wrestles with the question of whether he has gone mad.<br />  - Rodska's narration works perfectly, with different, unaffected voices and accents for the different characters, and a steady ratcheting up of the tension.<br /><br />Harris' book is a taught thriller with a solid premise built in the modern electronic architecture.  It isn't a work of deep literature, but entertaining, nonetheless.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I seldom write reviews, but I was very much compelled to do so for Wool. This book is fantastic. An incredible story told in a riveting way. Do yourself a favor, buy this thing. You will not regret it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great ap for basic organization!  There are a few little things that can be done to improve this already awesome ap: add alpha numeric rating correlation ability to checklist (ex. A1, A2, C2, etc) - allowing one to organize goals by both importance &amp; time table, on line instruction manual, please allow me to at least turn off the auto correct function - better yet adjust it more proficiently, ability to sync to mulitple devices (like PC), ability to correlate texts and check lists,etc.
B0036T31YY|5.0|Very cool movie. Not sure why so many give it a bad review. One of the few that kept me guessing at the plot and ending.
B000002LFZ|5.0|I, like many, grew up listening to music from groups like Fleetwood Mac.  Now they were not my all time favorites in my opinion, as I preferred Steppenwolf and Jimi Hendrix.  (I guess that dates me, eh?)  Anyway, regardless of that, there were some Fleetwood Mac songs that \\"hit the mark\\" for me, and this album contains most of those songs.  Ergo, 5 stars.

B000PUB9I2|5.0|When I first was exposed to French language music, it was via songs from Celine Dion.  The first time I heard her sing, I was captivated.  (though, I'm not as much of a fan of her English sung songs, which are pretty good, but not always as pleasant to me... with exceptions, of course).  So, as a guy, I think it's more natural to like women singers, as most minds of men are attuned to perk up when hearing a woman's voice.  It's just natural.  Anyway, so I started collecting French music, and at first, went for the female singers, as somehow I felt weird listening to men singing in French.  After a while, I got over that stereotype, and found there are some very good French male singers, and Francis Cabrel is one of the best.  Listen to some of his music on Youtube, and perhaps you will be inclined to order his music for your listening pleasure too.  Other very good male singers, per my taste in music, are:  Paul Piche, Yves Simon and Joe Dassin (who was an American born of a French immigrant, who went back to France, and died way too young).

B007H7XJD4|1.0|You need to drink at least 4 beers for this movie to be entertaining.  No plot, no consistent story.  It's a mess that only 4 beers can solve.  So grab a 6 pack and drink quickly to enjoy this movie.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is a fantastic film - the story very interesting with dramatic honesty about what abuse can do to a person in childhood.  Lisbeth's actions are very understandable in light of her childhood - every action has a cause.  The quality of acting is of course excellent, with the exception of Robin Wright whose makes only a lazy attempt at a European accent.  The ending is heart breaking - the backhand of the bourgeoise.  The American version is actually a little clipped when compared with the Swedish original, which unfolds with more detail and explanation.  The Swedish version is really terrific as well, with a different tone, and I have to say more loyalty between the two main characters.  Both are excellent films - definitely worth purchasing.
144382657X|5.0|Towards the end of 1944, with a World War almost over and the prospect of a Peace Conference looming in sight, Nöel Coward wrote a song entitled `Don't Let's be Beastly to the Germans'.  In addition to the line quoted above, it urged statesmanlike restraint with such sentiments as `Let's be meek to them, turn the other cheek to them'.  It was a sarcastic little ditty (inspired by Jonathan Swift, perhaps) and not intended to be taken too seriously.  But if it was played on the radio, or if (with a grim sense of humour) somebody took the trouble to despatch a gramophone recording to a large and solitary house called Ty Newydd in North Wales, it is just possible that an elderly David Lloyd George would have listened very intently.  He might even have been tempted to claim copyright infringement.  For it was, in very truth, a song which he himself had sung for the best part of twenty years, from 1921 until 1938.  It contained sentiments which he had urged, with deadly seriousness, upon his fellow-legislators and countrymen throughout that period.  For the man who was popularly supposed to have said `Hang the Kaiser!' and `We'll squeeze them until the pips squeak!' had changed his tune almost before the ink was dry on the Treaty of Versailles.<br /><br />In an absorbing, clear-headed and masterly analysis, Stella Rudman takes us step-by-step through Lloyd George's shifting stances on foreign policy from the Paris Peace Conference to the early years of the Second World War.  She prefaces her study with a brief and helpful account of how the word `appeasement' changed its meaning in the course of this period, starting as a `noble' concept, intended to redress legitimate grievances, but gradually coming to be viewed as paying the Dane geld, over and over again, in a vain hope of buying off the aggressors.  Lloyd George performed an astonishing volte-face in the years immediately following 1919, coming to be convinced that Germany had been treated far too harshly and that France, anxious to guard against a repetition of 1914, was acting with unnecessary belligerence.  Everything that France did was wrong; everything that Germany did (and thought) was right.  His views coloured those of most of his successors, with the possible exception of Ramsay MacDonald, and his only critics of equal stature in the parliamentary arena were Sir Austen Chamberlain and (later) Winston Churchill.  He called attention to the manner in which the Germans felt threatened by France in the west and by Czechoslovakia and Poland (not to mention Bolshevik Russia) in the east, while declaring that it was inconceivable that Germany herself would ever be strong enough to menace any of her neighbours.  All evidence to the contrary was ignored.  Perversely, he persisted in looking through the wrong end of the telescope until the events of 1937 and 1938 started to bring home to him the folly of his sentiments - though he rarely acknowledged that he had been mistaken in any way, and he continued to the last to regard Hitler (whom he had met in 1936) as an outstanding, far-sighted leader of his people.  His championship of Germany's cause, seized upon with delight by the Nazi propagandists from the early 1930s onwards, was probably the most irresponsible act of his career.  For, although out of office after 1922, his views on foreign policy, however bizarre and misguided (though undoubtedly well-intentioned), still carried a great deal of weight in the world.<br /><br />In precise, razor-sharp prose, Dr Rudman overturns several accepted judgments and her book is a substantial and important contribution to the history of this inter-war period, worthy to stand alongside the works of Zara Steiner.  It would have been helpful, perhaps, if more time could have been devoted to seeking the origins of Lloyd George's mystifying hostility to France and his admiration of Germany, apart from simply noting that it 'had strong roots' (p. 262).  But she has put the record straight ona good many matters and this in itself is an impressive accomplishment.  She could, indeed, afford to rest on her laurels, but it is pleasing to note that a book about Sir Austen is in the pipeline.

B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81 has a painfully slow beginning. It then turns into a paranormal horror story moving at a frantic pace. The ending is very random and unbelievable.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is insanely fun.It has all these unlockables that really keep you playing.There is an &quot;Ally&quot; system that lets you bring certain warriors with you and they all have their own little way of doing things so at the end of the day its a huge army of warriors versus the evil zombies.Buy it!Its totally worth it
B001E45XT4|2.0|These headphones blow ass.  It gets really hot on your ears after a few minutes of use, they are really tight (however I do have a big head... 7 3/4 hat size), and the sound is super tinny.  No bass whatsoever.

B004RZGUBM|5.0|A feast of Dickens.  How does Delphi do it?  A wonderful and elegant e-book covering Dickens absolutely completely with all sorts of extra biographical excerpts from many hard-to-find sources and very apt illustrations and comments, distancing by far any alternative versions!!  and for so little money in exchange.  Unique, truly.  Thank you Delphi Classics for this and the additional delightful Dickensiana Volume One which is absolutely imperative to check out as well.
0307454568|5.0|This final installment was well worth it.  So Stieg Larsson is a little long winded.  He explains a lot, in excrutiating detail!  But what you get out of that is a world of secrets, lies, corruption and a story of how a few people in well placed positions can absolutely destroy a person's life.  Hmmm, was he writing from experience?<br /><br />Not sure the Berger/Stalker story added anything to the overall story.  I found it distracting.<br /><br />Stieg should have nicknamed Lisbeth Salander \\"the cat\\" as this girl has nine lives and kept her computer hacking skills in place!<br /><br />It was a great trilogy, something I will read again and again.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|it is one of those books that pops into my head all the time throughout the day. I can't say much more without ruining the story for people, if you like MC stories, you'll love this one.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I finished it in less than 24 hours. I couldn't put it down. Some of the words were repetitive and yes there was innocent words, but this is what made me want to keep reading, otherwise it would have just been hard core porn. If other's are looking for more provocative words, don't expect that from a virgin. The sentence's weren't 100% on the spot, but I didn't care. I wasn't reading for English class. Just needed something enjoyable to read. I love the way the story draws you in. I actually read all three and can't wait till she writes another.

B002Q4TKAO|5.0|Could this be the best concert video ever?  Maybe.  I know this, after watching this concert I couldn't sleep.  I had the songs running through my head all night.<br /><br />Hey, I'm 51 years old.  I grew up with Boston, Journey, Fog Hat, Queen, and all that.  But, the music of groups like The Killers, The Kings of Leon, Snow Patrol, Coldplay, The Stereophonics, and so forth may be the best music in my lifetime.<br /><br />This concerts is great for is raw energy.  If you're a fan of the Killers you'll love seeing your band perform.  If you're someone who knows some of the songs, you'll be a huge Killers fan after watching this concert.<br /><br />Look at the play list.  They're playing all your favorites plus some songs that maybe you don't know but will enjoy all the same.<br /><br />The audio is great and the sound really pops.  The lighting and staging add to the over all experience.  Yes, it's like all concerts shot lately in that most of the video clips are a second or two long.  But it's fine and is extremely watchable.  I also watched all the bonus material and found it really interesting.<br /><br />And, as a bonus, I bought the DVD that came with the CD.  So, now I can drive around and listen to The Killers in the car.  Which means that all day long at work I've got Human playing in my head over, and over, and over.<br /><br />You'll love this concert.
0307956350|3.0|I don't know how to say \\"lukewarm\\" in Luxembourgish, but that was my response to the book. The story has a lot of structural problems that could have been cleared up with aggressive editing. Part I is a complete mess structurally, changing venues and time frames every page or two, sometimes every couple of paragraphs. This makes it hard to follow and keep track of the people and narrative pathways. It does smooth out later in the book, but is still in need of reorganization.<br /><br />Chris Pavone had an exciting story idea that would have worked much better if he'd taken the time to add depth and complexity. A Robert Ludlum-style thriller is what I'm thinking of, with fully fleshed out back stories for the characters, and more buildup to the various events, with enough detail to make them believable.<br /><br />As the story now stands, it's too domestic to feel like a thriller. Hang out with other expat couples, assemble Ikea furniture, pick up the kids from school, travel to a new European city every weekend. Oh, and spy on your spouse. There is that.<br /><br />So, as I said, lukewarm and in need of organization. But not terrible either. It was interesting to see how expats with a lot of money fill their time in Luxembourg.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent fast paced book. Well worth your time to read. Could not put it down, finished in 3 days, and was hungry for more. Almost done with 2nd book and already downloaded the third. the movie was awesome too, after you read the book, I'd say the movie is a must see! Enjoy!
B007SGM084|1.0|Beginning with the excessive cost for a Kindle download for the trilogy is where I will begin but this particular trilogy was a lot of hype over nothing.  The writing by EL James is repetitive and slightly boring.  I could probably condense the three stories into one great story which is how this should have been written by the author.  The \\"erotic\\" scenes between Christian and Ana merely make me want to slap both of them.  I felt that after all the internet chatter and the little blurbs coming out about the book that this would be an awesome series but not true.  As I stated very expensive and I have been more intrigued by a Harlequin romance book more so then this series.  Very very disappointed.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|I just got this in today and my 5 month old already loves it. We hang it from his car seat and he loves it. It keeps his attention and he loves putting the different textures in his mouth. I would recommend this to anyone.

B001F6ZIXC|5.0|I had nothing to do one day, so I clicked on Season 1, Episode 1.  4 seasons later, I have to say this show ranks right up there with Breaking Bad and The Wire.  Great acting, great action, amazing characters!  Don't miss it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I dont normally read novels - especially this kind.  But i was so intrigued by the characters that i finished all 3 in less than two weeks. I often times felt like i was a peeping tom in their relationship  - but i what i found were two people who needed each other and found each other.  I am glad i did not listen to the reviews about not reading the last book...if you have read the first two you absolutely need to read the third one. I admit i skipped through most of the \\"sex\\" in book three because I became consumed in their relationship and needed to see where it was going - if you enjoyed the first two, by all means read them all - i think  you won't be disappointed.  One of the best parts of the third book is what the author says at the end - happy reading! I cant wait for the movie!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Fun and reminiscent of Mario bros.<br />Good graphics and good pricing.<br />Plenty of fun. But, kind of easy...<br />The difficultly level was childsplay so good for kids.<br />Quite enjoyable.
B007HJAJSA|5.0|I'm so hooked on the Game of Thrones it's the only reason I have HBO.  I missed the first season and was able to get caught up streaming the episodes from Amazon.  Best series on tv, and boy does that hour go by fast.  Not for children, but definitely for adults. Bravo to the Game of Thones!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|My heart goes out to Jaycee for all the trials that she went through at the hands of Phillip Garrido and his wife. For all the life lessons she was forced to learn before she even became a teenager. Her story proves that what doesn't kill us really does make us stronger. I wish her and her family only the best and hopefully a peaceful life from here on.
B007HJB55G|5.0|Bravo to the Game of Thones. If you've missed the first season I highly recommend you do what I did, watch the entire first season streaming through my Amazon account. The second seaseon started on HBO a few weeks ago, but I'm sure you can stream those as well if you've missed them.

Can't wait to read the next one

0345803485|1.0|This novel (if a bunch of childish, repetitition words comprise a novel) is the biggest load of crap I've come across since visiting a dairy farm in Wisconsin when I was 7.  My tabby cat could write better sex scenes than this woman.  For all of you who think this book is precious and well-written - I'm scared, very scared for you.  It's a sad day when so many women appear to get \\"hot\\" over this book.  Time to re-adjust the thermostat, ladies.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun but I wish yhey didnt keep telling me to buy stuff.. kinds annoying. but very fun and addicting<br />. I keep playing it lol
0439023513|2.0|I was warned ahead of time that the third book was \\"not as good\\" as the first two, but I had assumed the criticism was directed to the quality of writing (let's be honest, these books are hardly literary gems - the plot is what keeps us reading).  But, no.  I was left hanging at the end of the second book, so much so that I literally ran out to get the third book from B&N same day.  I read the third book in one afternoon.  And then, of course, couldn't sleep.  I can honestly say that when I finished, I felt like I, too, was drugged up, depressed, and suicidal.  I understand the readers who say that Katniss' characteristics in Mockingjay are \\"realistic;\\" however, spending 200 pages in a drugged up, depressed, and suicidal state is not a good read.  It just isn't.  Collins conveyed the mood and temperment very well in about ten pages.  It just didn't stop.  And it isn't as though she found new and creative ways to get the point across; it just kept repeating, over and over.  There are only so many times a reader can stand reading about the places and positions in which Katniss is sleeping, or dialogues between Katniss, Gale and Peeta about how they would like to commit suicide, before our eyes start to glaze over.  I did not like the fact that by halfway through the book, I actually disliked or really hated every character.  Actually, I didn't feel strongly enough to hate anyone; I just stopped caring.  Finnick was the only character I liked the entire way through, and I was really surprised when he was nicked off along with a bunch of characters whose names I can't remember.  The first book, I felt, dragged a little.  I loved the second book, because I actually really liked every character and committed to them as a reader.  The third book crushed that, leaving nothing but a plot line that was very hard to follow and pretty icy, at best.  I am also one of the readers that truly disliked the end.  I won't give a spoiler in this review, but I cannot even describe how let down I was. It was fun trying to decide who Katniss should choose in the first two books.  But again, by halfway through the third book, both Gale and Peeta sucked, and I was actually hoping a third potential love would swoop in.  Of course, another third into the book, and I disliked Katniss, too (how could you like her?  She becomes a shell of a person with no personality, interests, or likeable traits).  I actually got a stomachache when she ended up where she did at the end - when the series began, I thought that the entire point was that Katniss needed to get the hell out of Apalachia.  Apparently not.  And it might be petty, but if the author is going to stretch reality such that a ratty and aging old cat (who, by the way, couldn't manage to find its way downstairs into a bomb shelter earlier in the book) could make it hundreds of miles from District 13 to District 12 and into Katniss' house in Victor's Village, then couldn't that same reality have allowed for like, I don't know, some warmth in Katniss?  Maybe a cure for Peeta? Or like, a potential relationship between Katniss and her mom?  I had to watch an hour of cute puppy videos on YouTube after I finished this book.  That's all I'm saying.  Don't read it around any sharp objects.
B000GCFY0I|1.0|I understood the concept. It was great. But couldn't stand reading Tally. And the weird lingo. I only kept reading because I needed to know what happened
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|It is hard to think of Matt King and his family as ordinary Hawaiians, given the fabulous land grant they administer, which could make them almost as rich as the Walmart family if they sold it to developers.  Alexander Payne goes to great lengths to make Matt feel ordinary, confronted with his wife's untimely accident and the sale of the estate.  Clooney plays his character like a less dashing Miles from [[ASIN:B0026IYLQS Intolerable Cruelty]], trading in his Armani suits for Hawaiian shirts and flip flops.  The music carries you through the film, with some great pieces by Ray Kane and Gabby Pahinui and other [[ASIN:B001O2ANY6 Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar Masters]]<br /><br />Shailene Woodley steals the show, as Matt's plucky teenage daughter who helps him sort through his failings and try to repair what's left of the family, as her mother is kept alive on a respirator.  Her boyfriend Sid provides a handful of comic moments, but otherwise seems rather useless.  Amara Miller as young Scottie King appears at first to be a major part of the story, but is all too quickly pushed to the sidelines in favor of her big sister.  From this nuclear family we meet the extended King family, which once ruled Hawaii in colonial times, Kauai anyway.<br /><br />It is more or less based on the [[ASIN:0812982959 book]] by Kaui Hart Hemmings.  I think she wrote it more as a comedy than a melodrama, which unfortunately is the way Payne presents it, hoping to mine more of the emotional vein in the book,  but ultimately the story rings hollow the way he presents it on screen.

I hope this is not the last we shall see of this character.<br /><br />I enjoy Baldacci's books and found this one to be one of his best.<br /><br />The new character if fully developed in this book and ready to take on whatever assignments Baldacci has in store for him in the future.<br /><br />Again the setting is Washington, DC - a town that the author knows well.  Robie is manipulated through a series of events where he is forced to come out of the shadows and operate in the open.  The plot centers around his working his way through the events and following the trail laid out before him and in the end outsmarting those that have been behind the killings and bombings in which he has become involved.<br /><br />If you enjoy fast paced Baldacci novels - this one should be at the top of your list.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|\\"Here comes the sun....the smile's returning to their faces.\\" -- George Harrison, 1969<br /><br />\\"I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say.\\" -- George Harrison, 1966<br /><br />This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited! As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time. Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching. This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.<br /><br />I've said all along that George was all about love. From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this \\"new little Harrison,\\" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love. Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children. George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people \\"love one another.\\"<br /><br />This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry. George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.<br /><br />George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary. George's sister, also named Louise has banged on the drum for her brother for many years. In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.<br /><br />Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting. It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old. In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression. His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.<br /><br />Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the \\"real world\\" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty. George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.<br /><br />George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan. His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois. He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait. His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French. George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.<br /><br />George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time. It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young. It was a trait that never left him. George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up. From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.! Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he and George inherited theirmaternal grandfather's tall, lean frame. Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George. You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary. Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him. Louise definitely left her stamp on George! Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)<br /><br />Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969. It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.<br /><br />Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way. She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing. Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all. Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born. Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.<br /><br />Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001. I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video. The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.<br /><br />George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many. I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism. She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite. This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker. Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles. She would let George \\"talk\\" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across. This later segued into richer, developed speech. As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.<br /><br />George's humor comes through time and again. His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: \\"well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys.\\" He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way. George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song \\"The Inner Light.\\" He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.<br /><br />A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music. George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like \\"Dear One\\" are beautiful prayers set to music for our prayer meetings, Bible studes and discussion groups. George is, as we say \\"a parishioner by proxy\\" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.<br /><br />Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.<br /><br />This dvd is a MUST HAVE for all George Harrison fans.  Again, this book is a gift that will keep on giving.<br /><br />You will also want to read [[ASIN:1889899054 Before He Was Fab : George Harrison's First American Visit]] and watch [[ASIN:B0007PICVC A Beatle in Benton, Il]], which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise..

B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I purchased this thinking it would help project the sound from my violin after I read that others had used it for this purpose; but it was just not the right tool at all. I could barely hear any sound when I tapped on the mic with my fingers let along trying to get it to project a live instrument. So, I actually returned it.
B0079R8KO0|1.0|Based on the positive reviews for this product I went ahead and ordered it. Once the cover arrived I was disappointed to see that the cover was warped! Not what you want to see when you are giving a gift. I then tested the product to see if it would hold the Kindle Fire up in the landscape display mode, and IT DID NOT! Waste of time and money with this product. Will be returning it.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I checked the DVD out on a whim from the public library. I was mesmerized by it! One of the most riveting films I have seen. Different from other Japanese films I've seen. Universal in the topic. Impacts the brain and the heart. Highest review.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was an easy read.  It had a great deal of action and suspence. I am not an action reader but it drew me in and I really enjoyed the characters and plot in the book.  As I read this book I believe this could happen to this country.  Unfortunately, I watched the movie and I felt it left a lot to be desired in the screen script.  My husband went with me to see it. He didn't read the book and it really missed its mark in presenting the story. He didn't like the movie. I understand that  they plan to do a sequel of Girl on Fire or Mockingjay, they are going to have to present it better to the non-reader public.

0439023513|5.0|I am growing to love this book.  I am an adult, so perhaps have a different perspective.  I think the book is Katniss' acceptance of her real role as the Mockingjay and discovering the reality of what is going on around her.  I highly recommend reading this more than once, as I didn't catch everything the first time.  It is a darker book than the previous, but that adds to the tale.  Katniss finds out some hard truths about war, and the leaders of the Capitol and the Rebellion.  There is resolution to many events and some people do die.  Read this book, but don't expect Stars and Butterflies.  This explores the harsh realities of war and politics and the aftermath.

0439023513|3.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" is the most gruesome book of the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, describing the horrors of war and how people are forever changed by it. If you haven't read it yet, do not read on now, as it is impossible to review this book without including some spoilers.<br /><br />After surviving two rounds in the arena, Katniss must now fight her final and toughest battle, by taking on the leadership role in a world gone crazy by war and suffering. And true to real life, this novel does not mince words when it comes to describing the atrocities of war, nor does it give any false hopes. War changes people and robs them of their innocence forever. There is no happily-ever-after, and no glory in war. Good people die, and hope dies with it. It's the reality of war, and I admire the author for not trying to glorify it.<br /><br />My issues with this last instalment of the trilogy are with the way it is written, especially the last 1/4 of the book, in which the author tries to pack so much horror that the scenes take on a nightmarish quality, leaving the reader confused and somehow cheated. There are a lot of loose ends, and unexplained events. How did Prim suddenly end up being in front of Snow's mansion? How did Peeta somehow sustain the same injuries as Katniss? In the rollercoaster ride of horror that forms the climax of the book, the reader is suddenly left out of the loop but instead is given a mere summary of events which destroy every assumption and belief the reader has formed so far.<br /><br />I hated the ending. Not because a lot of my favourite characters were lost (which is after all the reality of war), but because the characters who did survive were annihilated in other ways, by being so fundamentally changed by circumstances that little of their original personality remained. Yes, people are changed by war, and their spirits can be crushed beyond repair. However, I have met holocaust survivors who have retained a joy for life that seems impossible when knowing of the horrors they have gone through. So I was somewhat confused as to the message the author wanted to convey. Yes, war is horrible. But if all hope is lost, and there is nothing left to live or fight for, what was the point of the story? For me, the triumph of the human spirit over tragedy and injustice is the one thing that makes everything worthwhile. Without that, we may as well give in to oppression, as the alternative is even worse and there is no hope for a better future. By losing the essential characteristics that made Katniss and Peeta heroes for me in the first two books (Peeta's inherent goodness and Katniss' feisty spirit), all that was left for me in the end was a feeling of despair and hopelessness.<br /><br />All in all, I feel that this book could have been so much more by staying true to the personalities that were developed in the first two parts of the trilogy. However, the book sends a strong message regarding the horrors of war, which took courage to write and make reading it worthwhile - just don't get too attached to any of the characters!f the horrors they have gone through.

B0000683DH|4.0|It's been touted as the best Star Trek movie of all time, and I'd be hard to dispute that.  I'm a huge Trek fan, and love the parables presented by the characters and stories, as well as just the flavor of the franchise itself.  Trek brings me back to a time in the late 60s and early 70s when it was cool to be a sci-fi geek among sci-fi geeks.  We had or own clique, and welcomed everyone who was willing to share in a hopeful future where the bad guys weren't ourselves, but the mysteries we had yet to unfold and uncover.  Well, that, and occasional Klingon or Romulan.<br /><br />ST2 hearkens back to the first season of the original 1960s TV series, and reintroduces a classic villain.  We are given a taste of the past by remolding it in the future for a new challenge.  Shatner, Nimoy, et al, as well as Ricardo Montablan and Judson Scott who, when asked why his name didn't appear on the credits, told us in the audience \\"You know, I could've sworn I did this movie...\\" then quipped about a question of why he smoked, to which he replied \\"Well, it was either these or Chicken McNuggets...\\"  Whatever.  Personally I think the guy may have been embarrassed to appear in a ST film, even though it's the most popular one to this day.<br /><br />But, to the film; it's really good, but I think the director's cut is weighed down by insertion of extended cuts and scenes that hold back a tighter film; the one that I saw in the theatre on opening day.  I guess if I were still in my fandom heyday, then I would appreciate the longer version.  But, as a film maker, I do critique it as being over indulgent and catering to the hard core fanbase.  But hey, it's all about marketing in the end, and if the fans like it, then who are we to complain?<br /><br />I titled this review \\"A bit dated...\\" because it is.  We see regular TVs mounted for a world that would surely by now have something beyond flat screen TVs.  The blue screen work is respectable, but the print shows some of the imperfectionsof the matte work.  Not a big deal, but it's there for the more critical eye to catch, and possibly contemplate.  The \\"futuristic\\" CGI looks like CGI from the era, because hey, it is.  But for the time that was state of the art cutting edge computer graphics' technology being showcased in a major sci-fi release.  Impressive for the time, but again, dated.<br /><br />The gem of this film is that it was made.  And, get this, made on a TV shooting schedule.  The shots are tight and basic, and the cuts are few, which means this film's story and actors had to carry the film, because the cinematography sure wasn't going to do it (however respectable the spaceship shots are).  Shooting like a movie of the week makes for an infinitely stronger film with the material at hand.  And the film was probably brought in close to budget.<br /><br />There are, of course, the dramatics that occur in the story.  They are powerful to the classic dyed in the wool Star Trek fan.  They hit some heavier than others, but always garnish a reaction.<br /><br />Well written, well acted, well shot in spite of the production restrictions, this film shows how you can crank out first class material on a limited budget, make back your negative cost, and still please the fans.<br /><br />Definitely not one to miss.

This 15th Anniversary Special Edition has a few scenes in it that I have never seen before, and they were great!  Even if I had owned the orignal release, I would want this copy, as well!

B006QVRVJK|4.0|On the surface it would not appear that Yazmina Reza's \\"God of Carnage\\" would be an ideal candidate for the big screen because of the claustrophobic nature of the play.  Roman Polanski frames the film in such a way that you feel a stifling effect in the film's opening moments.  These instances are the best as tensions bubble just beneath the surface as coffee and cobbler are served.  It's when emotions erupt in the second half as misspoken words and glasses of scotch are bandied about that the film is less successful.  Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly are fine expressing the right degree of sarcasm and righteous indignation.  Strangely Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet are somewhat subdued in these moments.  It isn't that they are quarrelling over the playground scuffle their respective sons engaged in rather it is class warfare.  This is comedy of a human nature and it deserves to be enacted with the broadest of strokes.  Regardless, I give the film a qualified pass because it does challenge the audience more than most Hollywood fare.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|I have to start by saying that I am a John LeCarre fanatic. I have read every book he has written, books about the books he has written and have seen every movie based on his works many times over. I was really, really looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately it did not, in my opinion, reflect the book, mainly due to the liberties taken (Hungary? Prideaux shot in a city not the forest? No...that is NOT what the Circus looked like, Turkey? Tufty didn't die...) well you get the idea. It is also so different than the BBC series and none of the characters in this film \\"looked\\" or acted or behaved like how I envisioned the characters, including Oldman as Smiley. But of course Alec Guiness is the embodiment of Smiley...Even George Mason as Smiley, in \\"A Deadly Affair (1966)\\" based on \\"Call For the Dead (1961)\\" (even though in the film he was called Charles Dobbs) was more true to the written character of Smiley. If I knew nothing about the story it would have been just a slow moving, disjointed \\"trying to be an espionage film\\" that made no sense. I wish I could have seen this film without any preconceived notions and expectations but of course that is not possible. I suppose that it would not have been possible for me to initially like this film, but I will watch it again and again to see if I can find the diamond in this lump of coal and it will remain in my library as an example of a different perspective and interpretation of the extraordinary novel it is based on. It is a well crafted film and from an academic perspective, there is much to see here but from an entertainmant perspective it didn't work for me, and in retrospect, it really couldn't.

B007IJDXFK|5.0|I only just recently started getting into these guys.  I've been a fan of Doom/Death metal for a long while now.  Over time I've grown into a more mature taste of music...I can say honestly it all started with Devin Townsend...but that's a different story....<br /><br />I bought \\"We're here because We're here\\" and it took a while to grow on me.  I then previewed and bought \\"Falling Deeper\\" and absolutely fell in love with it.  After listening to \\"Falling Deeper\\" numerous times, I had to give \\"We're here because We're here\\" more time to grow on me...and it did.  After hearing their Death/Doom metal, I never could quite connect with it.  So, I'm probably going to fall into a small category about this band and say I like their new work much more than their old work.<br /><br />This album, is different in many ways than \\"We're here because We're here\\".  There's a lot of tempo changes and just all around different melodies.  All in all it's beyond a beautiful album...if you're a fan of Opeth's mellow stuff, Katatonia's mellower stuff...or Devin Townsend's mellow stuff...I highly recommend this album.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Pretty big letdown rather than climax of the series. All those characters you fell in love with? Either gone, or not the same people they were. Yes, war is awful, but the reason we liked the The Hunger Games form the get-go was because we cared about the characters. By the end of Mockingjay, I didn't care anymore- just couldn't wait to be done with it. :(

It is beautiful on blu-ray and this set was worth every penny! Pick it up, I promise that you will be entertained!
0307592731|3.0|First off let me say that I listened to the audio of the book and the fact that I found the reader's voice to be incredibly annoying may be coloring my opinion somewhat. Seriously, if you are interested in this book, read it, don't listen to it! The narrator tries to vary her voice when reading dialogue and instead of adding interest to the story, it's grating and silly. Every man Strayed comes in contact with is read with a goofy country accent and she switches to a soft, babyish voice when reading Cheryl's words. As for the story, I had hoped to read more about the lessons Strayed learned on her journey and a lot less about her sex life. I also wasn't overly fond of her writing, she consistently adds unnecessary details that simply don't add anything. By the end of the book I was tired of Strayed and bored with her story. I was very disappointed after all the great reviews.

0307387178|2.0|I liked the book while first reading it, it was interesting reading at first. However because the author wanted to make the book longer, he starts filling it with a bunch of things that don't apply to the story. The several pages where the author describes his own mountain climbing was stupid and was like a commercial in the middle of a movie. It was also boring and I skimmed over it just to get back to the story. The story wasn't just about Chris dying in the wilderness, there were a few stories of others who died in the wilderness and then the author tries to compare them - which just did not work. But I did finish the book (aside from skimming over the author's mountain climbing experience).
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|This was a fantastic book!<br /><br />Is not often that you find couple where both parties are as dysfunctional as these two.  The author however, manages to deliver an entertaining story while drawing you deeper and deeper into their relationship.<br /><br />I would love for the second book to give us a little more inside on Cary (her best friend), as well as some more background on Gideon's problem.<br /><br />I am looking forward to Deeper in You coming out in October 2012.
0345803485|5.0|When I first started reading the book I was a little shocked and uncomfortable.  I put the book down and then decided to give it another try.  WOW!  Am I glad I did.  I got all over my inhibitions and couldn't stop reading the book. I then had to download book 2 and 3.  Once you get over all the kinky stuff this is a true love story about how someone's past has damaged him but the love of a good women brings him out of the darkness and into the light.  A great book trilogy.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.  I highly recommend for those who gave the book a negative review to pick it up and keep going.  You won't regret it
B000HKWCOA|5.0|I am a huge Trek fan, of all the series. But I am ashamed to say that when this one was on, after the first few episodes, I stopped watching. Then a couple of years ago, it was playing on HD Net and I got absolutely hooked. The only Trek series filmed in HD, it is beautiful and as the series went on, it just continued to get better by leaps and bounds. The Xindi season (season 3) was incredibly suspenseful with just enough light-heartedness to provide relief. It has now become my favorite of all the Trek series.<br /><br />I just cannot believe that this has not been released in HD. For cryin' out loud, it was FILMED in HD! Anyway, I highly recommend this series.
B005T87QCI|4.0|it was really. cool while it lasted but I was able to beat it in a half hour so it was way to easy for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very creative story line! Loved the imagination of the author. I've noticed that this book is 'recommended' for approx 5th graders and personally I wouldn't be comfortable with that because of a few of the graphic situations when the characters are in the 'arena'. That's completely my opinion though. Other than that, I loved it!
B004469BQA|5.0|Satriani still never disappoints.<br />The Golden Room and Wormhole Wizards are WONDERFUL! If you love rock guitar you'll love this!
0439023491|5.0|I don't know how it's possible for someone to write a book that appeals to every age group (13+) but she does! teenagers and adults alike will enjoy this book. Brilliantly written, captivating. I couldn't put it down. a fantastic sequel to a fantastic first book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game -- my son plays it on his ipod &amp; told I should get it so we can play together &amp; see who gets farther :) hes 6 yrs old! !!  def reminds me of Mario brothers from YRS ago!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is incredible. I know it's geared towards teens, but I found it riveting. I couldn't put it down and I read it in one day! I was so ready to read the next book! I love the character development and the way that Katniss is portrayed. normally I don't like first-person-narratives, but Suzanne Collins does a brilliant job.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing game. lots of fun! this game is worth hours and hours of entertainment. I had a great time playing it with friends!
0439023513|4.0|The book was great. it was written differently than the first two, which makes sense since it is not set in District 12 or in the Hunger Games. Also, I thought it gave a great portrayal of how war can take it's toll on the minds of those who have seen it. Certain characters definitely do not make it out the other side the same as they went in, as they should. No one can see the trials and tribulations, the horrors that these people face, and come out unscathed. And while some people may disagree with how the characters change, I thought it was very appropriate.<br /><br />That said, I felt like the ending was rushed. I understand Suzanne Collins was trying to capture what its like in the throes of battle, but certain parts that I needed a moment to let sink in were glazed over. Characters that deserved a little more credit for their valiant efforts and heroic deaths were cast aside. I was so confused and rushed through the final climax of the book, it felt dream-like and I didn't really process what was happening till after I put the book down. I didn't feel any emotional ties to the people who died, and I should have. I should have, but the ending was so rushed I didn't.<br /><br />But that's really my only qualm with the book. I didn't feel like the characters were given the kind of respect they deserved. Aside from that, a great book. do NOT throw away the opportunity to read this book just because it's not quite as good as the first two. read it. read this book. (:
B003954I9C|5.0|I got this album for Christmas and I am absolutely in love with this album. I have been waiting for a Solo album by AJ McLean for years now. Ever since he did the Johnny No Name thing, he's been talking about a solo album and I'm so thrilled he finally made it (I only wish he included Lay Down Beside Me... that would have been the only thing that would have made it even better than it already is.<br /><br />KTBSPA! (brownie points for anybody old enough to remember what that means! ;) lol)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think it's great app. lots of good information. Data well displayed. I like it very much. Recommend it for any one.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun game that helped pass many hours of flight and airport waiting times recently.  I'm planning on buying future versions as they are out and I master them.
