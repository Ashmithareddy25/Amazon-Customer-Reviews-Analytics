0062059963|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book because I loved The Selection so much. However, it fell flat for me and was not at all what I was expecting for the second book in a planned trilogy.<br /><br />Mysteries were introduced in The Selection with the rebel groups and political intrigue of life at the palace. There was much potential for The Elite to explore the world and set up the plot of the \\"final battle.\\" Instead, it focuses on America's love life and how torn she is between Maxon and Aspen. I know that she entered the Selection following a bad breakup with Aspen, and it's understandable that her heart is in turmoil. However, it wasn't what I wanted to see in a dystopian. And, while she doesn't mean to play with their feelings, she ends up hurting both of them with her indecision, and watching her do this to them, to herself, made me lose some of the respect I'd built for her. She also nearly wrecks her chance of being with the one she truly loves because of her inability to open her heart and trust in what's happening between them.<br /><br />I really didn't see much purpose in Aspen chasing America all the way to the Selection. (I was actually a bit creeped out... it's almost like a crazy ex-boyfriend stalker scenario. And he was a really big jerk about breaking up. Who is he to start talking about how great they were when he's the one who didn't have the confidence to make their relationship work?) What America says to him at the end, however, has me wondering if there is some greater role to his presence at the palace. Hopefully there is because I'd hate to see him serve the sole purpose of adding a spice of forbidden romance to the whole affair. I'm not a big fan of drama-filled love triangles, especially when it causes the plot to stagnate.<br /><br />The world building was also sadly lacking in this novel, which was my biggest grief. For me, I expect the second book in a trilogy to thicken the plot and make preparations for the epic ending that's to come in the third book. While we do learn more about the history of the world in The Elite, it isn't much. There is still so much more being kept from us. I was also expecting to learn more about the rebel groups, but nothing much happens here other than a couple more incidents. I'm not sure how the rebel plotline can be wrapped up satisfactorily with only one more book left in the trilogy.<br /><br />I do want to know how the Selection wraps up, so I'll be reading the third book. And who knows? While The Elite ended up being a letdown, maybe I'll end up loving The One as much as I did The Selection. After The Elite, however, I don't have as high expectations for the trilogy as I did before.come in the third book. While we do learn more about the history of the world in The Elite, it isn't much.

B00155GDXC|5.0|This is a great novel (one of the best in my opinion) on a timely (2013) topic of cultural and religious diversity.<br /><br />In light of the Boston Marathon killings it could be too easy to stigmatize Moslems.  With over 2 Billion Muslims world wide (nearly 30% of the world's population)  there is room for plenty of diversity of beliefs and practices.  This is a prosaic and well crafted novel about diversity of beliefs and ways of life that motivates those of us that live in the West to question our way of life and our assumptions about others.<br /><br />A part from that the book is simply so well written that it is hard to put down until its last sentence is spent!

B00B69UQEO|2.0|This heavily marketed album built up a lot of anticipation. The first listen didn't thrill me, but sometimes it takes a while to appreciate a change in musical style.  This is unmistakably Depeche Mode, with a concentration on slow blues inspired songs. I have listened through the album multiple times, and it still isn't inspiring me. The extra disk in the deluxe additional is just more of the same.  I really want to like this album, I'm really trying to like it, but it's just not happening.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Weeknd has long been Canada's greatest kept secret. His mixtapes showed a great vocal range as well as new taste on topics of love, deceit, and heartbreak. This compilation is the combination of those mixtapes and showing of how much of an impact his work has had. This collection comes with a great value and in particular showcases the rise of an artist who could bring a new energy to R&B.

It is a mix of pop tunes and quirky soundscapes, much like OMD's older albums from the 1980's.  But the sound is crisp and contemporary, with hints of timbres you would hear in today's dubstep.

0937381888|5.0|I had read through his website, the book well worth the purchase if you're planning to home brew.  I read it cover to cover to know exactly what I was getting into prior to buying any brewing equipment.  I was hoping to skip extract brews and go straight to all grain and this gave me the knowledge and confidence to do so.  Although you can find plenty of plans and ideas on the internet, he even includes designs for the gear you'll need and all of the possible builds for each one.<br /><br />If you're getting into brewing or know someone that wants to, get them this as their first purchase, you won't be sorry.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I have really been into the biographies and auto biographies, so I was interested in this book. I remembered as a child hearing about Shirley McClaine sending her daughter to Japan to live with her father and thought that was a little strange. So I wanted to hear the now grown daughters take on her mothers decision. I wasn't disappointed. It's a good thing this woman only had one child because she didn't need pets let alone a child. The unfortunate thing in this equation is her husband didn't either. After you read the  things her daughter went thru growing up, you will be totally convinced that Shirley has never been playing with a full deck and if aliens have actually contacted her, the world would be better off if they would come back for her! Sachi is lucky to have survived the things she had to deal with as a young child. Physically and emotionally. I hope shirley comes back as a slug in her next life.

1476734941|5.0|This is a must life style if you want to live a healthy and disease reduced life. I have been watching this theory develop for about 30+ years. It initially started because people in various places on the earth were living very active lives beyond 100 years of age. Some in the &#34;west&#34; wondered why. This book has assembled important results of very different aspects of the lifestyle's scientific research. It is not a complete treatise on the subject, but a good start.  I thought myself thin and healthy until I started seeing aging aspects of my brain. Now I am working at tightening my lifestyle to hopefully undue or stop this process until I am a very old man.<br />  You cannot believe your average practitioner because the potions they prescribe now only slow the process and at great expense to the average person. Most of us cannot afford these marginal medications. It is not because people in medicine are malicious. They just don't understand anything but medicine and the human frame. This is why they are so skeptical of the results with other animals. This not to say that human trials are not needed, they are, but the results my friends will not become apparent for another hundred years. We will all be dead by then. So for us in the middle we have to go with the best information just like previous people who rebelled against the idea by medicine in the 60's that if you had a heart attack you needed to take it as easy as possible. The non-professionals saw that what was practiced wasn't working, so they went the other way and exercised thus extending their lives. It was those pioneers that changed medicine, not the profession. I knew one of them. We will have to do the same, just as I am with my doctor.<br />  This lifestyle regimen is flexible and without medications unless those medications truly are needed to sustain life. If all Americans were to take on this lifestyle the major killers of Americans would be virtually eliminated and those people would beable to live extended, healthful, functional and useful lives. 65 could be the 35 of today.

B00B23O96A|4.0|I used to hold somewhat the same opinion as those who don't appreciate some of Clapton'e recent work. After some time (and more listening) I've come to enjoy these much easier going selections.<br /><br />I have loved Mr. Clapton's music for decades, even manageing to see Blind Faith live in Toronto when I was 16 years old. Times change, I've changed, and so has Mr. Clapton.  The man has earned the right to play the music he likes with musicians he likes and admires. It certainly beats most of what's called music these days!<br /><br />\\"Still got the Blues\\" is a beautiful tribute to the late Gary Moore. Clapton likely wishes he had helped him out more while he was alive, as he has done with many other artists.<br /><br />For those who have listened once or twice and tossed this aside, I suggest they give it another chance and a few more listens. There is some excellent guitar work throughout, albeit much more subdued than in the \\"old days\\". His older albums are still around if you find can't develop an appreciation for his newer music.<br /><br />If Leadbelly could write and sing \\"Gallis Pole\\" and \\"Good Night Irene\\" (as well as performing old traditional songs he didn't write like \\"Skip to My Lou\\") why is Clapton not allowed the same freedom?

0553801473|1.0|There are so many amazing and well thought out reviews of this book, so I will be brief. I am an avid reader, have read all of the books in the series multiple times (I reread them all whenever a new one comes out), and think that the first 3 books in the series are the absolute best fantasy novels ever written. Then Martin stopped caring. Lots of people are saying it and it's so obviously true. He doesn't care about this world any more. If he did, he certainly wouldn't be working on other unrelated novels, running around on over-extended book tours, and basically ignoring this world that has made him a rich man and should surely be his passion. I'm a hobbyist-writer (I write for my own enjoyment), and when I write, I am immersed completely in the worlds I create. I can't wait to get back to my computer and see what my characters are doing, where they're going, and what's going to happen when they get there. And the story isn't over until it's OVER. The Song of Ice and Fire isn't over. Martin got us half way there with the first three books. The last 2 books have gotten us nowhere and introduced new characters that diminish the ones we love and muddy the waters of what was such a clear, beautiful stream - even if we couldn't see the sharp stones lurking at the bottom. He's lost his way. I honestly don't believe he'll find it again. I think we're doomed.<br /><br />Something else that has occurred to me is the meaning of his powerful (and of course justified) enthusiasm for the HBO series. He loves taking about it, working on, espousing it's verifiable greatness. I believe that the reason he's so enamored with the HBO show is because it's a return to the first three books. To a time when he cared, when he had a purpose, when his story had a purpose. That purpose is gone. Tyrion rides pigs. Jon Snow's resurrection is a foregone conclusion and so suddenly death means nothing, and a boring, useless punk jackass Targaryen who doesn't show up until book FIVE gets to Westeros before Daenerys. Because she - Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyeria, who is the dragon's daughter, and would swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming - is off in the east busy fretting about boys.<br /><br />It's a terrible truth, but the journey is over. Thanks George.<br /><br />Update: 8/15/2016. Now George is distancing himself from the HBO show and seems to be unhappy with it. Why? Because he's human, and he sees that the show is surpassing him and it makes him sad, or angry, or petulant (I've seen his interviews - I vote petulant). You should have paid more attention to your baby, George. At least for sake the loyal horde of readers you hooked with the first three books it's been adopted by parents who actually care.ros before Daenerys.

B00BKBCF38|2.0|I was prepared to be a bit disappointed with Ghost's 2nd album given that the debut is so excellent.  But even though they have done something a little different here, I still liked it from a musical standpoint.  What is really hard to get past however, is the very obvious distortion present in the audio.  This is not a matter of being biased by how the waveform looks, it hits you right away on the first song.  This is just unacceptable and why music producers continue to pull these loudness stunts on listeners is a mystery given how much complaining there is about the issue.  How are you supposed to get &#34;into&#34; the music if you think there's something wrong with your playback equipment?  I like loud music as much as anyone, but unless you give me an album that WANTS to be turned up there's no point.  Clipping signals aren't powerful, they're weak and depressing to listen to.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|What can one say about this classic Hollywood shocker ? If there's anyone in this universe that hasn't seen this film, you're in for a real treat. So many movies have come and gone since, that are more violent and gory and sexually explicit, but this is a real masterpiece. It's classic Hitchcock-what do you expect ? What starts out as a mundane little story about an average woman, involved in an affair and doing something out of the ordinary, turns,with one scene,into a horrifying suspense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat in dreadful anticipation of the outcome. As you watch this film, with repeated viewings over time, you'll find more and more fascinating touches in the film that only Hitchcock could provide. I also heartily recommend director Richard Franklin's PSYCHO 2, which picks up on the story some 20 years later. It took very skillful hands, and a bit of audaciousness, to follow up this cherished classic with a sequel that isn't tawdry or overtly Sensationalistic, and director Franklin managed to pull it off. As a matter fact, I would recommend watching these films back to back, for a really terrific, or should I say TERRORific, double feature!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I'd been avoiding the Peter Jackson movies because I was afraid they'd ruin the books for me. I needn't have worried, since this bears so little resemblance to Tolkien that calling it the The Hobbit is just a marketing gimmick. Yes, Bilbo is in there somewhere, and there are dwarves, and they're on their way to the Lonely Mountain. That's about it. A totally gratuitous Hollywood super-villain revenge subplot gets tacked on, Radagast stars as a sort of Ewok clown, the sequence of events is reinvented, there are booger jokes, and more. Basically every obligatory, predictable Hollywood children's fantasy movie trope has been layered on -- so much so, thankfully, that the movie is often unintentionally funny and otherwise pretty much forgettable. Maybe on a big screen the scenery would be cool? I'm stretching here.<br /><br />The one part of The Hobbit that's done well is the riddle scene. This scene really does convey tension, authenticity, and Gollum's grief at the loss of his Precious.

B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|There's no connection from 1990's Facelift to 2013's The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. While a decent, solid record, this is more a continuation of Cantrell's \\"Degradation Trip\\" than a follow up to Dirt or AIC or even SAP.<br /><br />As he tried to do on his solo records, Cantrell hides Staley's absence by dubbing so many harmonies you can't tell who's singing or by outright taking over the vocals himself. If there was a stand-out, set apart from the group song on \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" it was \\"last of my kind\\" DuVall's single, solo vocal song. Again, he's got just one here ... good luck spotting it. Granted, DuVall does play guitar on every song, including one lead, so he's a versatile member, but while Cantrell's vocals serve the harmonies and backing parts well, he lacks the vocal power of DuVall or Staley and his overwhelming presence dilutes the sound.<br /><br />This is perhaps the most solid mid-tempo record ever recorded, it never changes pace and in many way's feels like a 70 min song in 12 parts. And as listenable as it is (and the seemingly anti-religion or even pro-atheist lyrics and themes of the title track will certainly prick some ears) very little stands out and grabs you. Let's face it, some intensity would have been nice, harmonies mixed with some searing solo vocal work and maybe even a tempo change or two.<br /><br />The obvious standouts here are the \\"acoustic-ish\\" tracks, Voices, Scalpel and Choke. There's no laziness here with the lyrics either, you can't just guess the next line based on the rhyming scheme and that's playing well to AIC's strengths. Other songs like Pretty Done, Breath on A Window and Hung on a Hook feel more like filler for AIC, but that's like saying saying they're the worse of 12 solid songs. Other songs like Hollow, Stone & Phantom Limb suffer from production, the \\"wall-of-noise\\" effect of killing dynamics and masking vocals helps to keep these songs from shining and likely will make them stand out more live.<br /><br />A better, more coherent album than Black Gives Way to Blue, could have been helped by a lighter hand at the mixing board and a few cups of coffee. Stone is the first single, but I'd find it hard to believe Voices or Choke isn't next and will propel the record more into the mainstream eye.better, more coherent album than Black Gives Way to Blue, could have been helped by a lighter hand at the mixing board and a few cups of coffee.

B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Trying to be everything to everyone s a losing battle. I did not gain anything from watching his movie. Nothing against the actresses and actors. It just was not a movie worth watching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series. Leave it up to the Brits to make a seemingly boring setting so interesting, and without all the gratuitous sex scenes every other series have. And thanks Amazon.com for having the other season available when Netflix doesnt, you've saved my weekday nights.
034580404X|4.0|She can't put it down! She absolutely loves it. Got her off the couch! Now she wants more. What else can i say?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!!! Love that the venues get switched up. It is very addictive ....I am always trying to beat my high score. Keep it up!!
B000JCQCW4|4.0|I watched this movie twice.  The cinematographic effects were awesome.  The music along with the visual effects really made the movie.  Kind of sad though, rather depressing.

1400069289|4.0|This is easily one of the best business books of 2012. Part of its power is that it weaves the same basic principles through various fields of study (e.g., personal life, science, marketing, organizational behavior, etc.).<br /><br />As the author, Charles Duhigg, demonstrates in a fluid narrative, there is a growing body of literature on the science of habits. And while there is no magic pill, academic pedagogy, or high-priced consultant that can instantly rid us of harmful habits or help us create positive practices, a correct understanding of the principles involved sheds light on the tools we need to take control of aspects of our lives so engrained in habit we may sometimes (incorrectly) think they are beyond our ability to influence.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book has the potential for long-term staying power. As the literature continues to grow and offers more insights, I would even be interested in a second edition were Duhigg to pursue it. The science is so critical that this book could be published in several different versions with case studies focused on any sector of the market, various individual industries, and numerous time periods.<br /><br />The longer we live, the more habits we develop - for better or worse. Individuals who master the understanding and application of habits create a competitive advantage both for themselves in their respective fields and for the organizations they can influence.<br /><br />A mastery of habits can turn failure into success and success into legacy. Conversely, individuals and organizations who are slaves to their habits run a terrible risk of exacerbating their failures and falling tragically short of the potential legacies that could have been theirs had they the price of honest introspection and purposeful, educated, dedicated hard work.<br /><br />Duhigg's Power of Habit is an essential book for anyone desirous to modify habits in either their personal or professional lives. Again, there is no magic answer. Results require hard work. But the science Duhigg presents provides the basic foundation you will need to make changes in your life. If this book is used as an instruction manual instead of a casual read, it can be used to prove in your life the proverb, \\"Scientia potentia est\\" (i.e., knowledge is power).Results require hard work.

B00000273M|5.0|One of the many girl bands you want to fall in love with,the songs took me back to what I thought was the easy times the singers were great the songs were great.
B002SKZBQS|2.0|Geez Louise.....maybe my age is affecting my taste in books....but I don't think so! I didn't find ANYTHING horrifying or thrilling between the covers of this book. Yarrgghhh! I hate it when I waste precious reading time on junk. Just my opinion, but this was junk! I skimmed half of it, so forgive me if I missed something that made this book worth reading. I love King....but not this time. The only thrill I got was knowing I borrowed this ebook from the Kindle library and didn't waste any money on it!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Only giving it four stars since it takes patience and some skill to solve eliminate these tiles. And one must look closely. If your in a hurry find something else. If you are analytical, patient this is for you. Once completed I was impressed with myself. And another free app from Amazon prompted me to add this to my collection.
B0090EJR1K|4.0|I haven't seen this guys past movies, borat and Bruno but I was excited to see this.<br />Well it is different that what I thought but I was still great.<br />The jokes were cruel, racist, immature and plain dirty! What more can you ask for!<br />The plot was funny in a stupid way.<br />I like Sacha a lot after seeing this. He's a really dirty Adam Sandler(they even look the same)<br />Overall for the price I paid to see it $0 it's great.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Performance was out of this world. I've never seen such a performance as this ! The only downside to this purchase was the outer case to the DVD was broken, but the DVD was unharmed.
B000JLSLZQ|4.0|Really enjoyed the music and acting. Would recommend.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Beautiful! It was a gift and my friend loves Bocelli. We will buy again because Bocelli is loved all over the world.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Cord works great to charge my Kindle and my Galaxy Nexus.  I have purchased multiples to replace the short cords we have.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|After buying some better quality headphones I begin to hear them &#34;missing something&#34;, not because they were not good enough. Because what was feeding it was not detailed enough.<br /><br />I had the good quality music, good quality headphones - what was missing? After doing some research I found out that the DAC in my PC was totally shi**y. I already suspected that because my iDevices already had much better sound.<br /><br />After researching lots of audio fan websites and forums I decided to buy one with good reviews - with one must have feature - portable, because I sleep a lot in hotels and spend a lot of time on airplane short trips. I wished for something that helped my headphone experience to grow better.<br /><br />The little boy is exactly what I was looking for. Portable and gave such an amp (literally) to my headphones! I can hear full round drums, widely sounding chords and music that have those lovely low volume reverbs we so easily miss in bad hardware.<br /><br />I have no idea if higher quality (ie, costier) sound better, I hope they do, after all I want to have a better setup at home later. But for the road, this is my newest must have gadget.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is so much fun building the park and dinosaurs to go into it.  Just takes a contemplating around to get the hang of it.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|there are just good clean music definately worth buying highly reccomend. love there sound a must have glad i got it
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this wonderfully written book with small hints to my stomping grounds! This  inspires me to no end. Thank you for this.
B001HN6922|4.0|Disc skips at certain spots so I used alcohol and a piece of cloth and cleaned the surface, now its a little better but still skips. I bought this DVD used for my 2 year old and she still loves it even though it skips so that's all that matters and I didn't have to pay full price for a new one. Overall not a bad price compared to new and the shipping was on time. Now I'd like to invest in a \\"disc doctor\\" before I would purchase more used DVDs on amazon.
0743243153|5.0|A worthwhile read for most anyone.  However, last 1/3 of book gets pretty bogged down and rather deep;  one needs a still, long and cold winter's night to really get into the last 1/3.  However, the first 2/3 of book makes up for the other!
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|Celine has a gift and it clearly shows on this DVD.  For Celine freaks, it's a must buy.  I am not a huge Celine fan and, as a consequence, it only gets a four-star review.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  I even read the author's Q&A at the end, which I never do.<br /><br />I've read a lot of books with post-apocolyptic and post-society themes (World War Z, Robopocalypse, Ready Player 1, the Post Mortal, Hunger Games, and others). I place this Omnibus at the top of this list.
B00B6OEDS4|2.0|My impression of the album was of a more laid back, lounge music.  Generally alright with a soothing voice.  What got to me was the singing with poorly enunciated words that roll off at the end.
B00BDSRKHO|4.0|This CD is even better than History of Modern, OMD's last CD. The songs seem to have some of their old magic back and long-time OMD fans will not be disappointed.
B0034DBRFC|4.0|Highly recommended for anyone who is into 80's female pop.  Belinda is an underrated artist and the band and backup vocalists are terrific.  A high energy show.  It's a 4.5 star DVD.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl, you had me at, \\"I learned to keep my hand up.\\" The writing may be simplistic but the message, the anecdotes and the meticulous research set this book apart. It will have resonance for smart, motivated, self-doubting people everywhere. It should be required reading in the fifth grade.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|After I bought it, it required me to log in to amazon App Store, then it wouldn't work.  I'd touch the app after logging in and then it would take me back to the App Store.  NEVER to my calendar.  The free version works fine, re-installed it.
B00138KEH2|5.0|So many great songs. The innovative and funky yet hard hitting rock riffs from Tom Morello combined with the perfectly driven bass compliments from Tim C. driven by the percussive punishment of Brad Wilk make for a great sonic experience. The aforementioned trio formed the music that made Rage Against the Machine such a great and influential band. This power trio combined with the soaring vocals of Soundgarden's Chris Cornell make up an entirely different style of music than fans of Rage or Soundgarden  are used to, but the end result is a real treat to listen and move to.
B001VNL1XK|5.0|i'm glad they went out to lunch! this session will live on as one of the best recordings in American music.
B001HN6922|5.0|My grandson hadnt seen this one yet so he loves it just as much as the 1st one.  Now I can switch them around & it keeps him busy most of the day.  I have 2 turn them off bc he will watch them all day if I let him.  :)  Thnx again!
B0009IW98O|3.0|There are several interesting tracks on this album. There is not as much original material, but must of the material is good. The band is small and tight. This is a solid rock and roll album.
B00013RC8O|3.0|I wanted to see this movie since it was mentioned in Quentin Tarantino's movie Death Proof.  If your a movie fan or follower of pop culture it's worth a look - it captures the post-Woodstock nihilistic attitude of the early '70s.  There are decent car chases and great scenery. There is however a reason why this movie has been largely forgotten.  Barry newman is miscast and it doesn't hold up along side Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces and some other similar themed movies of the period.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|A book unlike I have ever read. Max Brooks manages to tell the story of World War Z so convincingly you feel as if it really happened.<br /><br />I was amazed at the little details about things that authors often get wrong that were always spot on. Details about New Zealand and Australia were correct for once. It gave me faith that the places and things I don't know were probably accurate too.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My 2yr old grandson just loves this dvd & was so excited when I received it.  He watches it all day if I let him . :)  Thnx so much!
B00156ZWV0|3.0|I did not realize so much of the work was vocal. I am not a big fan of the vocal pieces.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love this app. The only flaw is the app's requirement that it be connected to Wi-Fi in order to accept highlights and bookmarks. I take my Kindle Fire HD to church but without Wi-Fi access I cannot highlight. If You Version allows these to be stored locally and updated upon reconnection to a Wi-Fi source I'll gladly update this review to 5 stars.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is awesome one of the best I've read in a long time!!!! The point of view from a man was the best.  Please write more books.
B004SKLFJS|5.0|Great purchase that every dance fan should have in their collection. Michael Flatley is not as energetic as the original, but he is a little older now too.
B005UBNKWO|4.0|This processor is fantastic it does what i tell it to and It never gets above 50 Celsius when on a stress test/at 100 percent Usage for gaming this processor is great paired with a GTX 660 (non ti) I can run Crysis 3 at 20 FPS mainly because of my Graphics card but yeah good solid product
B000N5F6PG|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS MOVIE, I LOVE THAT I NOW HAVE IT ON MY TABLET AND CAN WATCH IT WHENEVER I WANT TO.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Wow, I just finished it and what an intense journey! While it was heart-wrenching, it was also funny and I really loved the relationship between Holder and Sky. It got a little bit cheesy at times, but I was able to overlook it because Holder and Sky were just so good together.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because I am a fan of Cirque Du Soleil and have seen all the Vegas shows.  I am not sure if anyone that is not familiar with Cirque would enjoy it as much as I. However, I had a neighbor that watched it who has never seen a Cirque show and thought it was amazing.  If you have been to Vegas and have seen &#34;O&#34;, &#34;KA&#34;, &#34;LOVE&#34;, this is like having a souvenir of the shows.  The 3D is spectacular.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse novels and True Blood. However, I was disappointed in the last novel and this one was even more disappointing then the last. Not a good story line, lost who Sookie is and was more like reading a bad teen book.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I admit it, I watch a lot of crappy, fluff TV.  Then I took a little look-see at Hannibal and thought, \\"Whoa!!  Why are people watching that dreck 'The Following' when this show is way more superior!\\"  I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something about this show makes my brain intensely happy.  Weird, considering I've always had an aversion to violent shows and/or scary, horror movies, etc., in the past.  The production value is stellar as are the writing and acting.  If you aren't watching this, you're missing out on one of the best shows to appear on network TV.  Bryan Fuller is fantastically imaginative and supremely talented - especially in matters of death.  It's so sad that his shows always get cancelled (RIP, 'Pushing Daisies', you are missed to this day).
B006RUJST6|4.0|This was really good! It was heartwarming, heartbreaking, funny, romantic and witty. Layken and Will area great couple. I really enjoyed it.
B00C25TCZ0|4.0|This compact disc is very, very good. This group is made up of many new members in whom I like and respect as musicians that seem to get it right. I didn't know who this group was at first site, but I am fortunate enough to have a manager of my local record store who knows the type of music I like,lead me to this one  and suggested I read who the members were. I have always liked Scott Gorham's guitar playing and often wondered what happened to him or what his new project was going to be after Thin Lizzy.<br />I am very pleased with this musical work. It has a Thin Lizzy sound but with a different type,kind, of personality then the group Thin Lizzy had. All the members of this group Ricky Warwick,Scott Gorham,Damon Johnson,Marco Mendoza,Jimmy Degrasso, are respected musicians and were apart of very good bands before they became a part of BSR.<br />This is a good sounding CD, it is package right and has a good booklet that has the words to the music in it plus pictures.<br />The only drawback that I can come up with is I wish the DVD was done better with some type of extras, but that is okay they will do better next time. My hope is that this group will keep playing together and become more comfortable with each other musically and have a long successful reign just like Thin Lizzy had.<br />You want waste your money in buying this one it is good, so go out and support this new band.<br />Oh yeah one other thing Nuclear Blast does good work for a recording company , so you can be confident that this C.D. will sound good and clear and worth the money.I agree with other reviewers in saying I am glad that this lineup changed their name as well. Thin Lizzy was a great band in whom I enjoyed listening to and will remember,but BSR is not Thin Lizzy.
0061438294|3.0|I might have liked this book better if I had read it before Janine's Driver's than after. Navarro covers good information; it is just that if all you look at is body language, and you don't have a person's baseline body language, than you are just working off of stereotypes which might or might not be true. I don't think it is enough to make a decision about another person.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|Does the \\"Complete\\" adventures include the entire TV series of \\"Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\\"?  If not, don't lie and say it's \\"complete\\".  It's just Blu-Ray versions of the movies, two of which sucked.
B00112ASYO|5.0|My son and I love all the animals and products made by this company!! I highly recommend them for all kids and parents with an intrest in educating their kids about animals!! Very realistic, down to every little detail!!
B00BY8DNK6|5.0|Of all the DIO compact disc, I have listened to ,this is by far the best one I have heard. The sound is clear,(except for the lead guitar sound which is a little weak) but overall it is just fine. No problem in going out and buying this one, it is good.<br /> Lets not forget the record company who put it out. Eagle Productions has done a good job once again congratulations and Thank You for going above the call of duty in making good sounding clear, crisp music sing out in your C.D.s.
B002LANLDK|4.0|I recently saw Fast and Furious 6 and became re-addicted to this series of movies. This move fulfilled my expectations and urge to continue to watch more and more. I liked that the original characters were reunited, and it made for an exciting movie!
0671027344|5.0|This is one of those books that you find yourself recommending to everyone. It doesn't matter what age you are, the story will resonate with some chord in you. It's filled with beautiful lines that you'll read over and over again because they are so honest and true. It's a short read, likely the length that you'll finish on a day or two in the summer sun.<br /><br />Please read it, seriously. Everyone should.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Picture do not show in Photo's they disapper. Sent e-mail to support got autp reply. Stock how to fix problem Tried the three things they suggested, they did not work. Sent second e-mail got same auto reply back. Still have problem
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game play is swift and the controls are easy to understand. You continue to earn money while offline so that is a plus.
B000J2BRQU|3.0|I like the story line better with the original characters, but it was nice to see something different that incorporates a character in the later movies in the series. It also throws me off that this movie is out of sequence compared to the rest of the movies (this movie should come last). Overall it was okay.
0375842209|5.0|It's a long book, and it took me a while to get through it. However, I am so happy that I did.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|As is true of all of Diana Gabaldon' s books, you had better hang on because it's a surprise a minute!! Loved it! I can't wait to start on the next in the series.<br />Five stars.
1400032717|4.0|I didn't think I'd be surprised by anything in this story, but I was. I enjoyed it, the perspective, and the supporting characters.
0545405777|5.0|My daughter wanted to reread this book. We love the movie and the book series. It was in great condition.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Does exactly what you think it does - it sharpens knives. I have used it on many pocket knives, kitchen knives, bar knives, fishing knives, etc. It succeeds with all of them. Great purchase.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I have always enjoyed gritty, &#34;in your face&#34; cop dramas, but this show shocked me and became a new standard for &#34;almost anything goes&#34; TV shows.  Still has me watching with repeats with a &#34;new show&#34; feel.
B004LP3AYI|2.0|Way too many typos, in this addition. I mean seriously, it shouldn't be hard to proofread a digital translation. The book its self get five stars from me, but come on Amazon/kindle, pick up the ball here.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I don't recall seeing this on theater trailers maybe it was one of those that went straight to DVD, if so I can see why. I woud disagree with some of the other reviewers who liken this to a Hitchcock thriller--I found it pretty predictable. I did however enjoy Jude Law's solution to his problem!
1932100660|5.0|Thank you Mr. Campbell for this book, it is very rare gift to explain such a complex matter in a clear and understandable manner. This book is full of science translated to plain English, book full of facts, results of experiments and a lot more backup information reassuring reader all the way through almost 400 pages of great reading. There should be a lot more scientists and writers like T. Colin Campbell, not just in biochemistry and nutrition, but in all branches of science and academia. I can't wait to read his new book Whole.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Quick and easy read. Good perspective as well. Nice to see a real soldier's point of view on different situations.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Coming to this novel from the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Well written, a must for anyone who has seen the movie and wondered what the book was like.
0738711500|5.0|I was very impressed with the book. It gives great explaination on how to read the tarot cards without trying to memorize the meaning of every card. If you follow the rules of the book you can relate to the pictures on the book to the meaning it is so simple. I have been reading tarot cards for 10 years and this book is the easiet to understand I wish I had this book 10 years ago. After reading this book and following the instruction I was able to go and relate this information to other decks that I had and it was amazing how I was able to just know the meaning without a second thought. I highly recommend this book for anyone who ready tarot cards excellent illustration on the cards.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Tarantino does it again. This is an awesome movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Tarantino, modern westerns, and heroic tales. My only cautions are that the movie is long, and the violence is of an exaggerated type. Think Kill Bill, but with guns and explosions.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|my grandson who is 2, has to watch this daily and sometimes its 6 times a day every day. So that should tell you something about the movie. Its cute about an over protective parent.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I do not care for most musicals, but this one is well worth seeing and having.  Buy your copy today.
1452115567|5.0|this book is amazing.<br />everyone should buy it.<br /><br />it's so cute, and the project is really great. what's better than a story about a guy and his dog? I mean really? and she stands on everything!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|It starts off a bit slow, and it has some sad parts, but this movie will take you for a heck of a ride. It's all about the journey, and how it tells the story; although it doesn't mind philosophizing, along the way, with a child-like wonderment.
B008M87GJK|5.0|It works just fine. Very useful and updates very often. I usually listen to the bbc world service. Bye bye
030746363X|5.0|At first this book seems enormous and like you couldn't possibly get through it all, but once you check out the table of contents you can tell that it's tailored. He makes it very easy to pick out a specific chapter based off the issue that you want to specifically target. I have had a lot of failed attempts at trying to get back to being healthy, but this book has helped more than anything ever has. It truly gives you a lot of knowledge.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I really enjoyed , this film , The Wachowski Bros &#34;OOPS&#34; I should say family . I am a big fan actors assuming different<br />characters , utilising heaps of make up with &#34;CGI&#34; enhancement . This film , Well I not the kind give away plots . This<br />Title has all the , I would to say that for those of us , who have the  1080p setup. This is it , the spectrum of of color is<br />fantastic , there is scene , I will not say which one , but definition is accurate you can with some of the mature characters you can see age spots , crows feet etc , and that is what &#34; Blue Ray &#34; all about . I Highly recomend this title..<br />Thank Everyone , For The Pleasure of Recomending This Film ..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|get it and you're hooked. I can't stop playing. it's like a little quick game then, BOOM, you've been playing for over two hours.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I scanned  slides from the 70's.  They came out really good and colorful. Easy to use.  I would recommend this item.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This show is so off the wall and intricate. If you like a challenge and something that will make you keep thinking, this is your show!
B004SUDQE0|5.0|I LOVE this movie! It is a great love story and the acting is superb! I love anything Hugh Grant does - he is such a wonderful actor.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a very good movie, what, with Dames Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and the rest of that wonderful cast I didn't just watch it on Netflix but bought it before it was released on Netflix.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game but it's so short, I wish it was longer. I hope they'll make more like this one.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Don't start if you can't finish this: best season ever.you won't be able to drag yourself away from it! Pure addiction!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is an absorbing account of a journey, both of the manuscript and the author. Insightful and gripping tale of an early<br />treasure hunter. Good read, but seems to end a bit abruptly.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Heard so much about this book. Definitely lived up to it's reputation. Has given me a lot to think about.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Excellent story and acting by Gregory Peck as a priest and Christopher Plumber as the Nazi officer. This is action packed drama and a true story during WWII taking place in Rome as the Nazis occupied Italy.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|No matter what the reviews say, Tom Cruise can never be Jack Reacher. I've read all of the Reacher novels, and have a pretty good idea of who he is, and it's just not Tom. In fact, Cruise destroys the franchise; ill ever be able to watch another movie with him as Reacher.<br />Reacher is a combination of Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwartzeneger. Definitely not Tom Cruise. He destroys the movie.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|These Maxell batteries to the trick and are a great price too. I can't see any difference in the life of these batteries compared to the Energizer ones. Save some money and get good quality batteries.
B009DA74ES|5.0|I wish these were released sooner. It seems like a long wait between drinks. I am really looking forward to season six.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Movies like this made in the 40s and 50s can't be beat especially when you have actors like Bogie and Ingrid.  Story excellent along with the acting.  No vulgarity, no nudity, no violence, just plan good acting and a good theme.
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|I saw Stev Hackett in Stockholm on May 24 doing only Genesis songs. This album has some of them. Very good!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I watched this movie because of Tom Hanks, and the preview.<br /><br />The movie was ok, I just don't care for homosexual scenes and gay storylines in the movies I watch. Not judging anyone, I just have my own preferences in what I watch.<br /><br />This review is just to let others like me know that there's homosexuality in this movie if they are sensitive to it.
B005I4JG80|5.0|The reading is smooth and fun. It is nice that she is a mother herself trying out on her kids whatever she is learning. And she is very honest on describing how far she can go by applying the French way of parenting. I believe I have learned very goods things from her experience and it made me rethink my own way of parenting. It is a good book for parents everywhere.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|It's been said before, but Bowie's most consistently good album since Scary Monsters, with only Hours and Let's Dance in the running.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Some parts are drawn out but overall a good interesting read. Different type of story with a somewhat predictable ending.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Absolutely love this Book!!!!! Will recommend this book to everyone that needs to know about this. I am quite moved
B00785P2QC|4.0|A lot of fun hours of entertainment I enjoyed it almost as much the original sim city. Showing my age but it was awesome.
B005APT8A8|5.0|The music is everything you hope it to be.  The packaging is not.  Flimsy CD sized &#34;box&#34; and paper sleeves.  Small quibble that does not detract from the 5-star-ness of this great set.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I dont know where to start!  I have waited with such anticipation for this book. Eager and sad at the same time to see how her story ends and now I wish I'd never read it. Obviously Charlaine was bored at the idea of writing yet another book, and it shows. Characters from the past showing up for what seems no reason. No real plot, like we've seen in her previous books, but dealt with it knowing that it would pick up in another book. We dont have that now. I wont go in to details as not to ruin it for anyone who has yet to read it, Charlaine ruins it all on her own. Slow, boring, little to no action. Lots of talk of fertilized land, and of course Sookie organizing and tanning, you know her typical vanity. For me all the characters I love, Pam, Eric, Bill are virtually non existent.  In the end it's about the all might dollar. She knew she could write pure crap and people would buy that have followed the books from the beginning, long before the HBO series. Shame on you Charlaine for not giving your loyal readers something to love, and enjoy, to cheer for, to leave a lasting impression. I have one, and its like a bad taste in my mouth.
B001QWBM62|4.0|No complaints, easy to use, compact, versitile, and extremely durable. I can see this lasting a long time in our organization and possilbly spreading to other departments.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I was extremely disappointed that I was unable to download the premium game either.  I am now stuck with a bill for this game that I never received to my Pandigital android tablet.  My loss, Amazon's gain.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Reading this book I must say was incredibly hard. My mother had lymphoma cancer and is in remission and I put my self in opposite position. What would happen to us if either one had died. Although this love story did make my laugh very loud, out loud. It also brought me to tears at least twice. I recommend everyone to read this. I sincerely hope that they do.<br />Purely life changing.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The depth of the characters and the feelings that were portrayed were exceptional.  I enjoyed the witty repartee in the text messages and emails.  The tension of new<br />beginnings was depicted well.  I was drawn in and couldn't wait to read the next two books, which just got better and better.  I felt like I was there.  Miss Ana and Christian and hope that there will be more books by this author in the future.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Hey. This game is cool. But it needs more updates. Have you tried computer it has 100 times the stuff this version has even though pc is 25$ it's way better. Really? I mean come on people! 7$?! How about the nether in this game? Oh wait there is none! 2*s.
B000002L68|5.0|I have wanted this CD for years. I never bought it, thought I was out of luck. Then I saw your posting on Amazon, and the price was unbelievable! Sounds great. Thanx so much.

B000X2H8G4|4.0|Mom is hard of hearing, refuses to wear hearing aids and refuses to use another similar device to this.  Because this is compact and  one piece, she has tended to use it more frequently.  Be sure to stock up on batteries, as you will have to change them frequently (especially if you forget to turn the unit off, as Mom does), but I consider that minor since she does use the device and we can communicate with her much more effectively.  Will not hesitate to buy again and again, when needed!

B002W1GCX4|5.0|I enjoy him since 2002 . My father got me in to him and he has good albums like this one.
B0018CWESK|5.0|This movie isn't like Twilight and everything is happy and everyone is skipping through daisies.  No.  This movie has vampires and werewolves at their actual state: evil. Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors of our times, and Kate Beckinsale is better than most of the more popular actresses.  Van Helsing has a way of getting in trouble and losing things that he doesn't want lost, and in this drama you watch how his character develops.  It's a great movie, I recommend it COMPLETELY.
B00CW665VI|5.0|5 Surprisingly Unexpected Stars!<br /><br />So let me just start with cover...there is A LOT to be said about marketing here. It literally hooked me like the bait it was. Then the high ratings sealed it for me. I dove in face first.<br /><br />I gotta say that I didn't start out liking the writing. I found it blatant and crude, but the sarcasm kept me hanging on (cuz that's a language I understand). I guess that's why I didn't like Drew from the start either...after all he's a huge man whore, and a chauvinist pig, but then somehow bit by bit he starts to grow on you and I started to have something like pity for the guy. When did he wiggle onto my good side...I do not know...but he did and I was routing for him. Despite the fact that he's a total douche. I actually ended up liking his blunt honesty about everything...refreshing I guess. He kinda knows a little bit about everything, he was annoyingly confident, and there were a few pearls of wisdom hidden among all of the other...ahem...'not pearls'. I found myself LOLing several times throughout the book. Tangles is a quick and fun read, and I unexpectedly liked it. Even with a huge jack-wad for a main character. Hey...I guess there is redemption for everyone...right?
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I like the continuing story of the survivors.  I definetly  have refered people to it.  I can't wait until I can season 3.
B000002G23|5.0|I enjoy all there albums and this box set is a good one to get if you like rare songs that you can't find on any thing.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie will go down in history as the new Mean Girls movie. It is hilarious AND it has beautiful music.  I appreciate this movie for the music and the humor. The story line, well isn't too great, but other than that it was pretty good!
B000J10ER4|2.0|Superman Returns is Brian Singer's love letter to Richard Donnor's Superman movie, but without any of the magic or star power to carry it.  The story, the acting, and the characters all fall very flat.  It has some good effects and action scenes, but not enough to make-up for a poor story, or lack-there-of.<br /><br />The characters do not work at all for me.  Brandon Routh is just a poor imitation of Christopher Reeve.  He definitely looks the part, which is why the studios hired him.  I also like the Superman costume in this movie.  However, Routh does not have any of the charm and charisma that Reeve had.  I do not care for this Superman either.  He is very stoic and broody and is not very proactive.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth does a horrible job as Lois Lane.  She does not look the part, nor does she have any of the spunkiness that Margot Kidder had.  Kevin Spacey does a decent job as Lex.  Lex does come off as more of a threat in this movie, which is nice.  However, he is still mostly played-up for laughs like the famous WRONG scene.  He also makes some of the same mistakes he did in the previous movies.  James Marsden has really a nothing role in this.  I do not understand why he left X-Men 3 for this.  The rest of the cast is alright but nothing great.<br /><br />The story is the biggest gripe for me.  The story is very drawn-out and boring.  Superman returns to Earth then really not much happens for a while.  It took a very long time for things to get off the ground.  The film throws in some action scenes (though good action scenes) to distract the audience from the fact that they do not have story to tell.  The ending is a lot like the ending of the first Superman movie.  The big threat is kind of underwhelming.  Here is no big super villain to fight but Lex Luthor again.<br /><br />The effects are very good.  This movie has some of my favorite action scenes of all the live action movies like the plane scene which everyone remembers.  The action is easily thebest aspect of the picture.<br /><br />Overall I like that they tried to bring back Superman to the big screen after twenty years.  However, good intentions do not trump execution.  I hope the new film The Man of Steel is better than this.  This film is definitely an improvement over Superman 3 & 4, but still nothing special.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I never thought that I would like zombie movies but this series is like a soap opera and I like soap operas.
B002LVUG3C|5.0|I enjoy his music and albums like this one. My father likes this album too. this one is for any one who grew up in the late 60's and likes bowie.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This movie is not one of my favorites, and never has been, until now. The reason being that I read about it also and realized it was the first of its kind. It is old fashioned and shows me all the progress we have made. Plus, she is gorgeous for her time!
B000IJ79V6|3.0|Superman 2 is a good film, and a good follow-up to the first Superman movie as it is.  However, it could have also been so much better.  If the studio had aloud Richard Donnor to finish the film and make it the way he originally intended then Superman 2, along with the first film, could have been one perfect epic instead of two separate films.  Instead Donnor was replaced with Richard Lester and the film is bogged down by this.  This review will be on the Lester version that was released in theaters.  I have not seen the Donnor cut yet, though I hear it is much better than this version.<br /><br />The story is that in stopping a terrorist plot and throwing a nuclear bomb into space, he releases General Zod and his two minions from the Phantom Zone.  Superman/Clark also reveals his identity to Lois.  Clark/Superman ultimately has to choose between the love of his life and saving the world.  He also has to fend off Zod and prevent him from taking over Earth.<br /><br />Once again Christopher Reeve does a phenomenal job as both Superman and Clark Kent.  Margot Kidder also returns as Lois, and does a great job once again.  The chemistry between them is one of the best aspects about the movie.  I like the moral dilemma Clark is put in.  He has to choose between his own happiness and being a symbol of hope for humanity.  The story and the moral is definitely one of the best things about the film.  Terrance Stamp also plays a great villain as Zod.<br /><br />However, like the first movie, I do not like how Lex Luthor is played up mostly for comedy in this movie.  I did find him funny and Gene Hackman does a good job playing him once again.  However, Lex should not just be funny; he should also be cold and calculating.  We do get that at points in the film, but not nearly enough.  His two henchmen from the first film are back in this as well.  They are funny, but I never liked Lex having bumbling henchmen.  It just makes him look more like a Saturday morning cartoon villain.  Plus, I do not buy them working for Lex again after what he did in the first movie.<br /><br />Another thing that I do not like is the more light-hearted tone in places, which I find extremely out of place.  In the production of the Superman 2 Donnor was let go and replaced with Lester to add a more light-heated tone to the film.  This is why you have goofy scenes like Zod and his henchmen's head on Mt. Rushmore.  Scenes like that seem out of place and clash with the more serious scenes that Donnor had shot.  Plus Lester added shots of Superman and the other Kryptonians displaying new abilities that come completely out of nowhere like the telekinesis beam or the magic kiss Superman uses at the end.<br /><br />I have to wonder what the studio heads were thinking when they hired Lester.  While the first superman movie was serious for the most part it was not that dark and had a lot of levity and comedic moments.  I do not see why they felt the need to make it more kid friendly.  Fortunately much of the film was already shot by Donnor before he was replaced with Lester, otherwise this would have been a vastly different movie.  Superman 3 is an example of what Superman 2 would have been like had Lester had complete control.<br /><br />Like the first movie I find the effects rather dated.  I know they were great at the time, but now I find them a bit cheap.  The effects did not ruin the movie for me though.  Many of the action scenes like the battle in Metropolis were entertaining.<br /><br />Overall if you like the first Donnor Superman movie, definitely check this out.  This film can get very silly but is still a good superhero movie.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|This set includes the almost 4 hour director's cut and two and a half hours of additional footage. There is one Grateful Dead song lasting 38 minutes. The documentaries are short and to the point regarding the planning and production of the event and the film. No director's commentary during the movie, but none needed.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm not disappointed with who Sookie ended up with, I'm disappointed with the writing itself. The story seemed hurried and the character resolutions were awful. I think Ms. Harris should have taken more time with this last book in a beloved series. I haven't been this disappointed since the finale of Lost!
B000HT386M|2.0|I just don't think he is very funny anymore! I don't like how these comedians keep trying to act younger than they are, they need to stick to their age, and not try to be twenty when they are forty.  It's kind of annoying. He is funny in his earlier stuff, but trying to pull that off still at his age is just something that shouldn't happen. It's a good concept in this movie though.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really like this author and how she rights. I am a big fan of the series. The books are an easy read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Just plain brilliant! Myself, my wife and two boys (6&2) all loved it. It was a great family show that did not have any questionable parts and nothing &#34;dark&#34;.<br /><br />Ray Graves

B00164KYV4|3.0|Well, it is kind of boring to begin with, but I mean it does have some life lessons to look into and makes you think of yourself. I reevaluated myself after watching this because I saw too much of myself in one of the characters... which will probably happen to anyone.
B001EQ5ZJK|3.0|This book was so difficult to read I never finished it. Good luck to all who purchase this book its a LONG boring read.

B008BU75IQ|4.0|This is the third part in this series and foolishly I thought this was the final book.  Now I will have to wait another 4 or 5 months to get the next one - if, in fact, that is the last one.  Love the writing and the story but am getting tired of being strung along
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The DVDs themselves were in good conditions. Dexter is my favorite TV show and I can not be happier with my purchase. If there has to be killers, why not a killer who kills killer? It's a good show. I recommend it HIGHLY. Number three on The Top To Watch List, when it should be first. Dexter is a very complex man, and when you rewatch them (because you will) you can see the little hints on what's going to happen. I love these, truly. And the story with the first season is something you would NOT expect!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It really helps you to relax after a hard work day. It is worth the money. Try it and you'll see.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|Enjoy the fact that I can read anywhere.  Makes it convenient for me to keep up on my Bible reading.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The Amazon app store has some of the worst games. But because Gameloft has games here, it's just awesome. You can't complain either, because the game is free. Only downside: having to get extra content to play it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The characters have little development. The story was drawn out and could have been told within half the pages, but wouldn't say was waste of time was a nice relaxing book to pass some time.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Prior to starting my reading of this edition (kindle English version) I had only read a few chapters of the Cliff Notes version as a young boy, so I'm no expert at comparing this version to others, but I can say that only 12 chapters into the story, I am very impressed with Hugo's writing style.  Seemingly no details are spared in describing the setting and characters.<br /><br />Some people complain that it's hard to read because there are too many references to historical events and persons (mainly from French history, but also many others, such as the old great Greek philosophers) and that the average reader today would have little knowledge of.<br /><br />While this was certainly the case for me (I'm no French historian), I just used the context in which he was referring to these sources and if I couldn't understand how our why he was using them as examples, I would just look them up via wikipedia or Google.<br /><br />I must say that this is obviously not necessary, but I have learned a lot about French history so far because of this, and I went back to reading the passage I was up to in Les Mis with mixed feelings.  Sometimes I would spend 10 minutes to reference a name and afterwards I didn't feel it was worth my time because it didn't truly add to my life or the importance of the story.  Other times I would spend twice that time and feel it was completely worth it.<br /><br />Now, I only look things up when I feel truly compelled to, as if it were necessary to truly understanding what Hugo was trying to convey by referring to someone or some historical event.<br /><br />Overall, I've gotten used to his writing style and I love it.  The story is epic and I love how deeply we get to delve into each of the principal characters in the story.

B00785P2QC|3.0|Another of million games that require us to buy credits to build certain features of the game. But us can play this one and have some fun before lack of credits become an issue
B00BESM14U|5.0|Excellent story, excellent acting. I did notice that Emma's accent faded at times but over all she did a beautiful job. I felt awkward a few times like I was almost embarrassed for the characters. For instance when they drive through a tunnel and Emma stands up with her arms out stretched. I guess I just don't get what that was all about but it's not enough for me to give less than a 5 star rating. I love the three main characters so much I wish there was a sequel.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I love this album. There have not been many albums which have moved me on first listen; moved me to want to review it; moved me enough to instantly want more; moved me enough to remind me why I fell in love with music; moved me enough to regret having taken a sabbatical, amidst a busy and hectic life, from listening and loving music for what it can be: musical poetry and astute lyricism.<br /><br />Sweet eyt rough; articulate and poignant; touching yet uplifting. Welcome home, music.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Richard Dawkins has managed to clearly explain all the available evidence for evolution while still admitting there are gaps in scientific knowledge.  I was instantly drawn in by his elegant and often biting humor.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is skeptical that evolution can explain everything about the world around us.  I am a skeptic no longer.

0142421715|4.0|It's funny that even though I don't LOVE the writing for this series that much, I still can't NOT read it. That is one cool plot. And there is finally some action here. And some development of the characters.<br /><br />Let's get this show on the road:<br /><br />Don't you love these covers? It's so cool that they sort of tell a story on their own, daring you to pick the book up and go find out more about it. Aaaanyway. It took me a while to read Crossed, but it was so very worth my time! It had ALL the things I always expect to see in my dystopian books! People running from crazy government employees, having to find food, water and shelter, suffering, dying (I'm a bit twisted in the head, in case you didn't already notice), only to prepare themselves to take revenge and save society from an insane, controlling world! Or maybe blowing everything to pieces and go away in order to start over somewhere else. Heh. *-* Su-weet!! Right? And that is me being slightly sadistic, though honest in my book-needs.<br /><br />My point is that Crossed was quite capable of delivering most of my wants (and I so need a copy of Reached!). Cassia was stronger and more determined than ever. Ky let us take a longer look into his heart, and became more lovable and complex and vulnerable because of it. It was an amazing thing to see (read?). And Ally kept things very fresh for us, changing POVs, making the characters GROW as we watched them. Lovely!<br /><br />A lot happens in a very short period of time in this book, and so much changes! It felt more like a longer novella than an actual book in the series, but it was still enjoyable to see more into the trading world of Archivists, the Rebels and Xavier's secrets.<br /><br />Now, where's my copy of Reached?
B0025KVLRO|3.0|This album has its moments, but if you want a truly fully charged rcok album with bite try Capitol's Second Album which is Lennon heavy.  Better yet, if you have an IPOD program the songs in the following order:<br />Roll Over Beethoven<br />Thank You Girl<br />You Really Got A Hold On Me<br />Devil In Her Heart<br />Money<br />You Can't Do That<br />Long Tall Sally<br />I Call Your Name<br />Please Mr. Postman<br />I'll Get You<br />She Loves You<br /><br />This was the first Beatles album I purchased (I was seven).  Listening to the remasters in this order brings back great memories as until 1987 it was the way I sequenced the songs.  By the way, Meet The Beatles is a stronger album than With The Beatles.  On these two occasions at least Capitol got it right.  I wish they'd have put out Sgt Pepper with Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane (which, despite what some think, would have fit on an LP - hell Beethoven's Ninth could fit on an LP in 1958 at 70.05)  As it is I just sequence them in on my IPOD.  The biggest mistake the Beatles ever made was not including these two on the LP as they are the only two which come close to rivaling John's epic \\"A Day In The Life\\".  It makes  Sgt Pepper a much better album - espeically with the addition of \\"Only A Northern Song\\" which was originally slated for it.  Horses for courses.  One can do the same with Day Tripper and We Can Work It Out and sequence them onto Rubber Soul.  Thye fit in nicely and in no way damage the flow of the rest of the album.  Better yet, get rid of that silly What Goes On while you're at it.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Being a big fan of their Tron: Legacy album I was skeptical about this album since it was so different.<br /><br />After hearing it the first time I can't put it down!  This album IS different but definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />A lot of the songs have a retro feel to them but that does not detract from the album.
1607066017|5.0|I have never heard anything less than glowing reviews for this series, so i'm not sure how exactly to add on to those with anything fresh and new.<br /><br />The most important thing to know is that this is an AMAZING series. Straight up, no bones or exaggeration. Fiona Staples art is amazing, raw in the right moments, dynamic and full of life. Brian K. Vaughn's script is clever, interesting, without flowering sentiments or any sort of strange speeches. Everything seems completely natural and real. This story, of a fugitive couple coming together from opposite sides of a war no one really understands anymore, fleeing to find safe haven for their child is simply breath-taking.<br /><br />Stop reading reviews and just read this comic already.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was really great. Reading some of the reviews I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy it or not but I'm definitely glad did. Rest in peace Chris Kyle and thank you for your service.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|I liked the concrete examples and story format that made it easy to read.  Sometimes  I found myself yearning for a more in-depth study of certain areas.  But what this book does best is to give you a mental picture of what you're trying to do with the business and why having that picture is so important to your success.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Very retro, but not. Wasn't a big arcade game player way back when, but this did bring back some memories. It's easy to pick up, and get lost in. For a long time. Bright, colorful, hypnotic. High speed and just gets faster. Well worth paying $2 for. I played first on my HTC Inspire, then on my Kindle Fire HD. On the Kindle, it (the fighter) does get &quot;stuck&quot; if I go too low and accidentally get on the menu tab, (which cost me some lives) but when I realized what I was doing, a quick tap back on the screen brought control back.  Definitely something I will come back to for a good time waster.

B0054S6N04|5.0|First of all I loved Janie and Sam.. I loved their chemistry, their evolution, how they clicked, everything.  Could have been a little hotter with the sexy scenes, but that's be... I'm a closeted smut lover.... .<br />Major Bummer about the girls, because I think that's sucks for Janie... I'm happy she had it, hate that she lost it.  The &#34;bad guy&#34; that was a total WTF for me, I didn't see it coming, until it was obvious.... The story line was food, it's recommendable.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It had plenty of everything (comedy, romance, suspense, etc...) It was all there for me.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|I enjoyed Jackdaws. It was suspenseful and kept my interest even though I had to read the book in many short sessions with lots of interruptions. The story drew me back again and again. Folks who love to read about WW II will love this fast paced yarn.

B001XV3LSS|5.0|I thought Contact would be a typical sci-fi based in strictly Materialst Philosophy that would practically deify science.  It wasn't that at all.  Besides being well-written, well-acted, and well-filmed, it also artfully struggled with Science vs. Faith without passing jugement on either.  The film starts slowly, portraying a typical labratory-like environment where each day is much like the next, but it builds in excitement.  By the end, the situation is getting really exciting.  Contact is fun to watch for the special effects but it has a plot equally as engaging.  The science vs. faith struggle is an added delight for the intellectual.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed this historical fiction book very much.  Reminiscent of Roots, it held my attention and had very good character development.  I was a little disappointed in the ending, but I guess there is an opening for another book, which I will gladly consume!
0307476073|4.0|Grief does strange things to people. In Strayed's case, her mother's death led to divorcing a husband she loved, teetering on the brink of heroin addiction, getting an abortion, and deciding to hike 1,100 miles on her own across the Pacific Crest Trail. Early on in this memoir we realize this is a healing journey filled with metaphors of life's unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />As the author of a memoir about my husband's untimely death from colorectal cancer, just three weeks after his 47th birthday, I more than identified with Strayed's railing against the fates . . . how could her \\"good mother\\" die at 45, just weeks after her lung cancer diagnosis? Ours is not to question why, or in this case, maybe it means following the trail to learn how \\"mysterious\\" and \\"irrevocable\\" life is . .. to \\"let it be\\" as she finally concludes as she hikes through the wild. As the author sets out on her hike and her \\"search\\" for self and healing, we see a young woman's determination to test the fates and embark on a risky journey toward redemption. The compelling descriptions of California and the Pacific Northwest along the PCT are a hiker's delight, but by the end of this 316-page memoir, we have read one too many false scares ... bears, moose, rattlesnakes; not enough money waiting at the next post office along the trail where Strayed has forwarded her meager funds, leaving her thirsting for an ice cold Snapple lemonade but down to her last two cents. The book is rife with metaphor, the trail, the \\"pilgrims\\" she meets along her hike, most of whom are arrestingly portrayed, her guide book, The Pacific Crest Trail, Vols. 1 and 2 which is her bible.<br /><br />Maybe it is just me, but whenever a book is selected for Oprah's Book Club as this one was - guaranteeing bestseller status - I find myself wondering why or how Oprah, an entertainer, has been catapulted into an \\"authority\\" on what makes for good literature. While I enjoyed Strayed's descriptions of some of America's most wildly beautiful countryside of mountains and desert, I felt at times manipulated, suspecting the author knew she was going to turn this hike into a book, whether novel or memoir. Strayed's love for her mother, Bobbi, shines through, especially in one riveting scene where she is forced to shoot her mother's beloved horse, Lady. That scene alone elevated the book into the realm of literature . .. the horror of death,the betrayal the dying feel, while the living helplessly watch beauty crumble to its knees. This more than any words about stumbling in too-tight boots along the PCT spoke to me, felt most compelling and haunting. I could have done with one less bear, strange man or Snapple lemonade along the way.wildly beautiful countryside of mountains and desert, I felt at times manipulated, suspecting the author knew she was going to turn this hike into a book, whether novel or memoir.

B003YHSE7W|3.0|This movie doesn't make much sense and makes you ask too many questions. Can anyone sitting in a hovel in a former communist nation build an arc reactor? Why does the villain wait for Tony Stark to put on the suitcase suit before attacking him? Why don't Tony's suits have any kind of security in them to prevent unwanted access? Why is Happy so... happy about beating up a $10-an-hour security guard. The guy probably had like a wife and kids he was trying to feed and now he can't work.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is funny, though.

B00A4YZWN2|3.0|I just finished this novel, and I feel… disappointed. I wanted more. The whole way through, this book didn't grab me as much as the first two in the series. The emotion rarely jumped off the page and into my heart. Perhaps my expectations were too high.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I did like it. But I expected to love it and I didn't.<br /><br />To me, the story just didn't feel finished. I would have liked to see Lena have some stillness, some time to reflect and move on from the survival mode she was in for most of this book and Pandemonium.<br /><br />There was so much grief and fight and grind, and not enough pay off. Interestingly, I felt the same way about The Hunger Games conclusion. Perhaps I do expect too much.<br /><br />I'll be interested to read other reviews and see if others have felt the same way or whether I'm just being a grouch!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Brilliantly sad, beautiful, and happy all at the same time. A must read for anyone who believes in what it means to love and be loved
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved the book for many reasons, most of which I can't really post because of spoilers.  I think Ms. Harris tied up Sookie's story very well, and I was pleased that so many other storylines were completed, as well.  This was one of my favorite Sookie books, and it only took me a day to read it because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I know a lot of people were critical that she was ending the series, but I think that she did a wonderful job in doing so, and I am glad she didn't continue on until it got tired and the writing stilted.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|So, the Movie Masters Man of Steel Superman figure.  I like it.  I really like it.  More than I thought I would, even though there are many factors that say I shouldn't.<br /><br />For instance, I wasn't a particular fan of the suit redesign for the new film, but it works perfectly for the action figure.  The issue with the actual suit is that the lack of red shorts makes the suit look too monotonous in the pelvic area.  This is not an issue here due to the nature of action figures and the separation of the parts for articulation.  It kinda looks like Superman is wearing blue shorts, which breaks the monotony.<br /><br />Also, while a complaint you'll hear about this figure is that it doesn't really look like the production picture up there, you need to hear me out: this is a good thing.  For one, the suit in the actual figure looks a deal lot more like the actual one than the one in the production photo.  The photo makes it look too smooth, while the figure imitates the suit's texture from the film.  Not only it makes it look more accurate to the film, but it also makes most of the articulations seem less obvious than the ones in the production photo, which gives the figure a more natural look.  Furthermore, the cape looks better in the actual figure too.  You'll notice in the production picture it doesn't really seem very well attached, but that's not a problem in the actual figure, where it's seamless.<br /><br />The one thing the production picture has over the real figure is that Henry Cavill's likeness is better, but the one in the figure is actually good too, just not as much, but with the correct lighting it can look great.<br /><br />While the figure has slightly less articulation than others in the Movie Masters line, it's still pretty good, and the figure is very posable.  That being said, the cape is quite heavy, as it's made from rubber rather than fabric, which while it makes it look better it hinders the figure's posing chances.  Though you can still get the figure in good poses if you're careful and patient or make use of other tools, like the Superman-symbol-shaped base the figure comes with (side note: it's very easy not to notice this base in the packaging, since it easily blends into the background.  I almost threw it away with the cardboard until I noticed it by accident).<br /><br />The one thing I find dissapointing about this figure is when I compare it to other Movie Masters ones, since other figures from the line come with either an accessory or a part to collect and build another figure.  Yes, it comes with a nifty base, but that's it (there are Man of Steel figures around with accesories, but they're from a different line and you can tell the quality is quite low).  I also kinda find dissapointing that there are only three figures in this line.  And not one of them is a female one, either.  No Faora, no Lara, no Lois Lane, not even a Jenny Olsen or whatever.  But if I don't compare this figure to others in the line, if I look at it by itself or I compare it to the film it's attached, I think it's pretty great.get the figure in good poses if you're careful and patient or make use of other tools, like the Superman-symbol-shaped base the figure comes with (side note: it's very easy not to notice this base in the packaging, since it easily blends into the background.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Hobbit on Blu-ray is one of the finest looking blu-rays in my collection. As to the 3D version I can't say since my projector doesn't support 3D but on release day it was the same price as the 2D version so I bought it as my next projector will most likely have 3D support.<br /> If you like the LoTR movies you should equally enjoy the Hobbit Ian McKellen is excellent and Martin Freeman is brilliant as a young Bilbo.<br /><br /> While I'm slightly annoyed by the fact that they are stretching this into 3 movies, I love Middle Earth and would probably keep going to see the movies if they are well made and there was a hundred of them!

B00BHSEKAK|5.0|A plush fit for the plush X20.<br /><br />The top part of the case that covers the back and the front of the camera is removable. I remove it when I go out to shoot, leaving the bottom part on the camera. This provides a nice leather grip that is already beginning to mold to the camera and to my hands - a nice quality of genuine leather.<br /><br />The top part goes back on when I store the camera.<br /><br />Another thing to note - some cases for the X20 do not fit when the lens cap is on. This one does.
0143119680|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. I was afraid to finish it because I didn't want to loose the characters despite having bought the squeal 3 days prior. Very well paced and balanced, the only problem I had was not reading too many hours past my bed time. I couldn't put it down, which is something very new to me.<br /><br />(I'm far from a Literature or Humanities expert; my education has been focused on math/science. please forgive my review if it offends it's just my happy insight I realized as I reflected on the book and characters a week latter. When telling my mom again how inspiring this book was and that neither my friend nor sister appreciated/relayed the same importance of the character was to them.)<br /><br />Personal insight: I really appreciate the character development and complexity. There are few stories I have found that are able to accurately expose the complexity of being a confident, professional, intelligent, driven, single woman who also has the need to be appreciated and understood as a woman. This book beautifully reflects the challenges and struggles many of us face between balancing our independent professional self and allowing ourselves to be respected as women with appreciation of chivalry. (Usually diving into our profession is safer but leaves our personal.) Its a difficult dichotomy to live and express, but the way the character reacts I found myself at times reacting out loud only to read a similar reaction from the character a few lines latter. It may sound silly but it breaths hope in me that this type of women can still be appreciated, desired and maybe make it all work.<br /><br />I have recommended it almost anyone in my circle and extended circle and thus far only received thanks for the recommendations from everyone. Including  from to co-workers who have text-ed me their appreciation and enjoyment of the book to my gym buddies who I gave my only copy to, NOW I NEED TO BUY ANOTHER so I can re-read it.

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie was probably the closest to History accounts that I know of. It actually taught me a lot about Lincoln that I did not know. If you want your children to get a history lesson, then have them watch this if you can keep them interested. It is defiantly an adult movie and teenagers might get a bit bored or lost in what's happening and being said in the movie.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to History buffs and those that just want to learn more in an exciting account of Lincoln's life.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|Take Shelter's director, Jeff Nichols, is a filmmaker of considerable skill and talent. The film's story is profound overall and the process of its reveal is sublime. Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain in the lead roles execute outstanding performances in a visually stunning and moving contemporary meditation on the complex interiority of the individual navigating the social and personal relationships in the face of impending catastrophe.

B005JTAP4S|5.0|In a small village is a boy named Peter who is ten years old. (or 85 years old and a lifelongian. You'll have to read the book to know what I'm talking about.) He has grey-green eyes, a hazy smile, and unkempt strawberry-blonde hair. Peter was a well-mannered boy. But suddenly, he is thrust into a magical world and greeted by a strange bird dressed in a lavender shirt, taupe waistcoat, rose-tinted spectacles, and navy slippers. Peter enters a strange and amazing place he can't believe. Turn and twists will keep you glued to the screen and as the plot thickens, you will enjoy one heck of a ride and journey.<br /><br />Peter A Darkened Fairytale is a book full of strange, intriguing, crazy characters that I thoroughly enjoyed and loved. The action scenes were fast paced and had me on the edge of my seat. It's gripping, with well-crafted plot that kept me turning the pages. Set in a fairytale world that has everything from white witches to beautiful elves, this book took me into a mysterious, magical world that I couldn't get enough of.  What I really loved about this book is how different it is, I mean this is a world where fairies howl! : )<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to my friends. I give this book 5 stars, and can honestly say I really loved it. And I'm an adult with kids! I just love fairytales and want to read anything I can get my hands on.  I'll have to see if this author has any other books out. I haven't checked yet, but if he does, I'm all over them!
B0050PLT8W|4.0|I purchased all 4 of the Theory of a Deadman albums and this is probably my second favorite after Scars and Souvenirs.  I find myself repeating and singing along with many of the songs on this CD such as The Truth is, Lowlife, Love is Hell and What was I thinking. Catchy, easy to listen to music.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have not found ANYTHING about this app that I don't love. I can mix sound for my yoga practice, morning and evening meditation, even to bring my energy levels down when I need to sleep, but can't seem to get tired. Anyone that meditates on a regular basis needs this app. It works best when sounds are mixed together, as just one sound doesn't have the same effect. Fantastic. Probably my favorite app I've ever downloaded on ANY of my devices. (As demonstrated by the fact that I wrote a review at all, because I never do.) If I could give it ten stars, I would.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Okay, I'll try to keep this short and simple: This game is FREE, no biggie if you hate it. But this game is awesome, it's a great time passer. Like I said before it's FREE so get it now.

B007KZY1YY|3.0|I did not really enjoy this book as I found it to be a little monotonous and unexciting.  I would have preferred to have had a more gripping story to keep me wanting to read on instead of just a few chapters at a time.  I guess I just found the character Gray a little boring with his self indulgence and obsession with sex and the female body.<br /><br />Maybe suited for the younger reader.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Spent 20 minutes on the phone with eBay nobody had a clue why their application doesn't work.  I can log-in on a PC (anywhere) but the Android mobile app will reliably fail.  Ebay spent nearly 5 minutes at first explaining how their security server works, etc., etc., but the bottomline is that if you can't log-in from an Android, then why bother offering an app??  Out of all the positive reviews, I can only assume those were the few fortunate ones for whom the application actually worked.....how many thousands have just given-up, said \\"forget it\\" as I plan on doing?<br /><br />Not that Google makes it any easier - Android assumes that applications work, it's not like you get a slew of MAC addresses or such that security firewalls can accommodate, etc.  Strikes me as 21st century technology meets 20th century application.

B009NY43NY|3.0|I've read every other book in this series (most multiple times), and ripped through them like butter when they were released.  Even the last few, which have kinda gone from `sizzling' to `lukewarm'.  I've even gone to a book signing and met the author, I was so invested in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  Started this one with the intention of savoring, since it was the LAST ONE...did NOT have much trouble putting it down to make it last longer.  Just didn't keep my interest, and almost made me wonder if the author resorted to a ghost writer (sad but true).<br /><br />I DO recommend you read this one if you want `closure'.  The main characters' storylines get tied up (even if it's in tight, painful knots you really don't care for).  This reader was underwhelmed by the way it all turned out.  *sigh*<br /><br />Most of the usual suspects are present, but some only as cameos.  Felt more like shoutout reprises to jog your memory who everyone had been.  Sookie's love life, which used to burn white-hot, pretty much fell by the wayside in this last installment.  Yes, there is a romance angle, but the main plot lines center around an elaborate whodunit, and a couple of mysterious `who or what is trying to kill Sookie off and why'.  All pretty predictable.<br /><br />A long set-up prologue hints at several thinly veiled evil nemeses for Sookie, unnamed at first, but way easy to figure out their identities.  The meat of the story picks up the day after the previous installment, \\"Deadlocked\\" ended, so it's no surprise that Sookie raised Sam from the dead with the cluviel dor, using it's magic up in one fell swoop.  That darn little snuff box is central to everything that happens in this book.  It's the reason Eric makes his ultimate decisions, Sookie's life is in danger yet again, Faery gets involved, and Sam acting like a stranger.  He's been mentally changed by his beyond near-death experience, and figuring out why is pretty much the most interesting thing to discover, and takes most of the book.<br /><br />All Sookie's past lovers are here in the finale.  Bill has been reduced to a supporting role, with a hint of an HEA for him, or at least a reasonable facsimile.  Eric, ah, Eric Northman, smokin hot Viking god of the underworld, makes scant appearances, makes all the right choices for his reasons, and is generally a total d-bag in my honest opinion.  Alcide became a hulking, good-looking bodyguard-supervisor, again with a hint of HEA (with someone besides Sookie).  Quinn gets only a brief mention, updating his current life situation then gone in a flash to stage yet another flamboyant supernatural ceremony--one most readers won't like and don't even get to read about.  And Sam?  The `always wanted to never tried' flavor of the month?  Hmmm.  He's messed up in the head since coming back from the dead, but Sookie finally does get to the cause...eventually.  I don't want to spoil the Sookie/Sam storyline, but I found it highly vanilla and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Without spoiling an already lame story, a LOT of throwback characters make reappearances, some more than others.  Amelia and Bob (the ex-cat) slink back into Sookie's life, to assist in solving the KILL SOOKIE plots.  Sookie makes peace with Amelia, though finally wakes up to the fact that she can't exactly tell Amelia everything or it will come back to bite her (or crucify her, or blow her up, or yadayadayada).  Mr. Cataliades and Diantha are integral to pretty much every part of the finale, popping up here and there like scary CRIMESTOPPERS.  Tara and JB are now overcome by too much RL with twins, Jason's upcoming marriage to Michelle (which didn't even need to be mentioned, as unimportant as it was to the story), Hoyt got a one-liner, Pam got promoted, Jane Bodehouse sheds drunken light on the mystery, Andy is his usual wishy-washy lawman, Alcee Beck takes his dislike for Sookie to a WHOLE new level...I won't go on, but the book felt like a giant retrospective of Sookie's life, a kind of clumsy attempt at that.  Anybody that's survived to this point in the series gets honorable mention at some point.  B.O.R.I.N.G.<br /><br />I was disappointed in Sookie's choices.  Ho-hum, boring human.  She'd been obsessed with Eric for VOLUMES, and now kind of shrugs off the infuriating turn of events with him.  WHAT?  No break-up sex or anything?  For shame!  Eric shows a modicum of appropriate jealousy (and just WHY did he have the right to be jealous--he's the d-bag!), but what he does about it is just infuriating, in a disappointing sort of way.  The author might as well have killed Eric off once and for all, since she destroyed the character and the Sookie/Eric relationship completely.<br /><br />Totally storybook-type almost HEA ending, which left me with `meh'.  I would have rather it go out with a bang rather than a whimper, but at least we got closure.  SLAM., a kind of clumsy attempt at that.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|My 19 month old granddaughter loves this doll which her new baby sister gave her.  She gives her doll a bottle when mommy feeds the baby.  And she takes the  doll outside for walks in the stroller, which she also received, every day.  This baby doll has proved to be perfect.  It is soft and very lifelike and the perfect size for a small child.  We love it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to figure out, seamless payment process. I've been using app for a few months now and never had a problem with anything.
0345803485|5.0|This is a great book!  I think it's been publicized enough to know what the hype is all about.  Great vacation read!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|A lot about this H/S game, is good to great. But. Some objects ( ie.) dragonfly, bullets, danger signs, are still so small even when you zoom in are well, are not what they look like or are so, so, cammyed you miss them. Or just don't look like the object. ZOOM feature should be better. Besides that I enjoyed it. Since Game Fish Games started to get to be &quot;A rip off&quot;... I've enjoyed G5 games a lot more then others. Thanks G5.
B0073COMKW|5.0|I keep having cfl's burn out in my house, no idea why, I guess it likes to eat their ballasts.<br />This light strikes on instantly, warm white is very incandescent like, it runs very cool and actually does approximate a 60 watt bulb, perfect for recessed lighting.<br />Very economical too.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child's first Jack Reacher thriller pits him against a corrupt organization operating out of a small Georgia town. The book is a well written piece containing Child's signature short sentences and fast pace. The story itself plays out well and is entertaining to watch unravel, but there are some minor issues here and there. The airport scene was especially bad. The lady is screaming as she dies but nobody sees her? There are no cameras around?<br /><br />If you can suspend your belief it's an absolutely entertaining read that introduces one of the best characters in modern literature.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Stitch's naughtiness and Lilo's sweetness complement each other nicely and it is so cute.  Everytime I have seen it I cry laugh and are constantly saying &#34; awwwww!!&#34;  I love this movie and will never get tired of it. A classic.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I love this game it's great, the music reminds me of Zelda a bit. Basically what you do is match pares of three tiles (or more) of swords, rocks, wood (for building), keys (for tresure) and many other things. While your doing this you are going through the dungeon trying to defeat the enemies. Spend the money you earn from the dungeon for powerups.<br /><br />Why I like this game:<br />Easy gameplay.  Different.<br />Keeps you on your toes.  Potions for even more fun.<br />Many powerups.  No need to spend extra money.<br />Never ending.  No ads.<br />Great price.  Music is great.<br /><br />Overall I give it 5 stars, very great. You'll get addicted, trust me. :)
B0057LUI0O|5.0|The music is very catchy and kids will love to get up and dance everytime. The story is cute too.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works as advertised, no problems using it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a Kindle Fire.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game has very good graphics and gameplay. The only things wrong with it are adds and the fact that its the same as wedding salon just better. You only have access to some items so you have to buy the rest.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|I had been looking for this CD for a while, and your price was excellent! I had received a gift card and this made it simple no shopping out of the house!
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|This CD really represents the best of Madeleleine Peyroux offers. Her voice, cadence, pacing and interpretation are flawless. She sounds like a smoky lounge singer with a velvet smooth voice and sophisticated timing. This is sultry, sexy CD that is perfect for evening unwinding with your favorite cocktail.
B0002HZSMQ|3.0|Much smaller than we thought from the picture. Should have read the details better. Didn't end up giving it as a gift. Expensive for size.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I don't know how technically sound the plot is --- but it sure is a LOT of fun to watch.  Great acting, casting and script.  You will go through the season very quickly.  If you are starting the series - I would suggest doing it in the weekend.  You'll definitely want to go to the next episode right away.<br /><br />Very engaging and very relatable characters!  Enjoy!
B004026QIO|5.0|Wonderful comfortable summer shoes for my daughter.  Easy to take on and off, and they look cute! Very Happy with this purchase.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|This man knows how to put words and music together like no other! I have so much respect for his talent! If you haven't listened to him yet, you should! Don't rush through the tunes. Pay attention!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is AWESOME. I mean, just look at the graphics, the gameplay, and the.  Non complexity it gives us I recommend this if you love temple run
B0013FNC38|5.0|If you haven't listened to his music/message, take time to do so, but, don't rush. Enjoy. I think you will be glad you did!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|she couldn't be happier ...unless I presented him Live for her. However, since that was Mother's Day gift 2010 she<br />is a tremendous fan...and so am I having attended show also.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I didn't like the beginning of the book.  It kinda lost me.  But as I got into the book I really enjoyed the few characters from the early books that made a reappearance and I really liked how the book ended.  A very fitting ending for the Sookie series.
B00CI1TQHM|2.0|this sounds kinda like making music for money. not good, kinda dull. This is not the Visage i grew up with, OMD new cd blows the doors off this cd. not a good effort. sorry, I loved Visage is the 80s, but the new 2013 Visage, a shadow of the past.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. You hear the songs on the radio, you go to the concerts. You imagine the Gods of  rock are living the dream and Wham you read this book and realize there's so much more behind the pyro and make up.<br />Thank you Nikki for pulling the curtain back and exposing the inner workings of your heart and soul.
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|Was expecting more good music from this cd, but was almost put to sleep wil the slower tempo songs. I purchased with M&Sons. No comparison.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|He has a few misses with his hits, but this one is a definite hit. A really good page turner.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|I think that Anthony Hopkins was perfect for being Hannibal Lector.  He is menacing yet charming in his own way.  He reminds me of his role as Titus Andronicus in the movie Titius.  It is a great play by Shakespeare with lopping and chopping and cannibalism.  Anyways I noticed how he in a strange way has a deep respect for Will Grahm, yet tries to have a low class henchmen be his puppet.
0547572298|5.0|When  I looked below at \\"people who bought this also bought \\" I saw Neuromancer by the ultimate poseur and ponce William Gibson.<br /><br />Billy Boy you are not and never will be Philip Dick.<br /><br />Sure you can write, but then so can my 5 year old son.<br /><br />Phil had something to say, something worth listening to.<br /><br />Billy Boy writes shopping novels like he's  channelling Jackie Collins.<br /><br />Please read Philip Dick, please, please ignore pathetic William Gibson.
0307951154|5.0|This is the best Harry Hole book! I am counting the days for the 10th Harry Hole novel since the ending of this book leaves you with such a climax. Jo Nesbo is one of the best thriller writers on this world and Harry Hole is character that you will fall in love with. I read on the Jo Nesbo website that Police/Politi (10th Harry Hole book) is coming out in Norway this fall, hopefully the English translation with be available here too! It is not necessary to read all of the Harry Hole novels in order since each one of them can stand up alone. I got hooked with The Snowman without knowing anything about Harry Hole. Hope you enjoy the Harry Hole series as much as I have! Ellie
B0087ITBT8|5.0|This movie I wont lie IS VERY SLOW at first. However, it turned into quite an amazing, heartfelt movie. We loved it!
B000002L75|5.0|Some Great Reward is among the best releases of Depeche Mode during the 80s so far before their sounds get darker
B005LAIIJY|1.0|well is a fantasy blow of white hateing crap  with warped views of reality so  its really for those with lower IQ  and hey if its your cup of tea go for it
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A man. A boy. A horse and a war. If you aren't aware of the bond that forms, then you will become aware. If you are aware of the bond that forms, then you will live this story to the very last scene. Either way, this one will engage the core of your being.
B0092YRYBS|4.0|Don't get me wrong, the album itself is good. I sounds just how you want Two Door to sound. Nothing too adventurous or new. The Live tracks from one of their UK shows from the past year is great, though. The sound is great and the crowd is really into it. Spend the extra and get the Deluxe edition. You won't be disappointed.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Ever wake up and not be sure, if your dreaming or... More than a rethink of perception, reception, extraction and ...<br />( This is not about the neighbor's leaving their TV on all night )
B00A7W29BE|1.0|this app is not for the kindle fire hd for the obvious reasons started above multiple times... and sorry to whoever made this app but your attempts to shut down these reviews only makes it look worse.
1616550414|5.0|A must have for any Legend of Zelda nerd.  Bought as a gift for a true Zelda fanatic and they just loved it.  Very impressive hardbound book.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|The fact that this was backed with money to become a movie and make it theatres is crazy! This was horrible, I turned it off durring the middle and dont regret ever watching it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|My kids wouldn't stop bugging me to read this. So glad I did. Don't know why I waited so long. Great book. Kept me guessing till the end. Can't wait for the movie!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I had it on my iphone now have it on my kindle fire. love it.<br />it's simple but super fun.
B0058SNI9O|4.0|Perfect for everyday wear! You cannot go wrong. Also a perfect gift for my daugthers, they liked it a lot.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love these shows the English version is much better than the tv series. More detail and explains more. Love it
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is awesome the gaphics the gameplay the history all them the pice becaria the coste was 0,99 cents xD
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I usually don't find British tv that good kind of dry and no sex but this series is entertaining .
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Good game but you have to buy the rest of the game. But other than that it is pretty interesting.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was not your typical love story.  It touched on the wall that people put up when life has hardened them. Loved how the author portrayed loves struggles in breaking down those walls.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The delay of updates on my kindle is very disappointing. I love this game but it has frequent issues switching cities. I'm still in Tokyo but the game is supposed to be in Miami???? Please fix and I'll give five stars... Thanks!
B00BJDARGO|5.0|There has been a lot of trashing this Blu Ray because its only a partial concert. That maybe, but the sound is awesome, and I've seen Whitesnake  live 3 times in the last 3 years and I feel like I'm there in Japan rocking with them. I think they had to cut itshort for the Blu Ray format since Frontiers Records is a small company in Italy. I think the funding was limited. I am bias, I love Whitesnake I always have so anything they do it great to me. I love the Blu Ray.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing... I couldn't put it down. This book will have you addicted by the second chapter! I suggest this story for young adults.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Funny enjoyable for the family as it teaches elements of life also interesting cool<br />Silly things to do with it.also amazing that there is six elements and you make more.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I had been using the same log in and password information for about 75 sites for years.  My email was hacked leading me to send out hundreds of thousands of opportunities to buy male enhancement products.  One of my credit cards was hacked leading to a late night call from my bank about purchasing dating services in Australia.  After this I decided to use more complex passwords and to not use the same password, or log in, on different sites.  After researching various options I decided on LastPass.  It has been great at generating and remembering complex passwords that meet various websites requirements.  The apps for my Android phone and Kindle Fire HD work great.  My only complaint is that when I log in from my workplace computer it initially prompts me to purchase the enterprise edition.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I love the game, it is the best game that I have. The game has good audio and  video. The game is amazing.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Excellent book.  Kept my attention for the entire length of the story.  Highly recommend this book.  The characters are well rounded.
B007IK44CK|2.0|Bummer!  I'd been looking forward to this movie (which was brought to me, happily, by the marriage of Amazon's Prime Instant Video and Roku, which totally rock as a duo), as I'd liked the first three.  However, this was a dreadful disappointment.  Perhaps I should have been forewarned by the fact that the \\"Incredibles\\" director, Brad Bird, was at the helm, but this was infantile.  I can't count the number of silly things completely wrong with this film.  Tom Cruise runs, as he always does.  His co-stars' dialogue seems to be comprised of what you'd hear in a 6th, or maybe 8th-grade, classroom.  There's lots of \\"interpersonal drama,\\" as if we all care.  The female costar, who is about Cruise-sized, so, 5'5\\" or so, kicks a big bad guy's ass, in hand-to-hand combat; utterly unbelievable.  The only people who could find that scene believable are those who've never been hit.  Simon Pegg is the best thing about the film, and the only remotely natural character.  The other male lead, Jeremy Renner, is actually quite good and FAR more believable than Cruise at the tough-guy routine.  The plot holes are so large you could drive the BMW prototype car that other reviews rave about through them.<br /><br />I'm all for great, silly action films.  I don't mind a lack of believability, generally, but I have to be able to suspend some level of disbelief.  \\"Humorously\\" bickering co-agents on a critical mission?  Puerile nonsense.  90lb. girl beating up a 220+ lb. guy?  More nonsense.  The  method of breaking into the Kremlin was absurd; Cruise picks a set of handcuff locks with a paperclip (man, is anyone EVER going to get tired of that old cliched device, ever?) and escapes from Russian cops (while being considered a TERRORISM suspect that killed boatloads of people); Russian cops find the \\"Secretary's\\" car--now, we're talking about a Cabinet-level US Representative, here--and open fire, killing many of the occupants.  Hunh?  Does anyone think that would ever really happen?  Renner's story as to why he's behind a desk is positively the stuff of silly soap operas, (think, \\"Twilight\\" type depth) and his purportedly heartbreaking \\"I could never work in a life-or-death situation again\\" should win a Razzie for worst dialogue.  I won't even get into the ridiculous magic climbing gloves for the world's tallest building, or the equally magic physics-busting building entrance.  OR the blown knee that works fine one scene later.  Whoever wrote the \\"sandstorm\\" scenes has never been in a sandstorm, either (yes, I have).  Overall, as I said, just...silliness personified.  A cartoon with live-action figures, about as engrossing and believable for grown-ups as Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner.  All it needed was the ubiquitous falling Anvil, hitting Cruise on the head (I wish), so he could get up, unhurt.  It would have been the perfect ending.
B001974DG0|5.0|Loved this book.  After reading this book, I started reading all of his books.  This book was purchased as a gift as I have bought many copies, one for myself and for others.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|A really entertaining movie.  If you've only seen the movie trailer, this movie is probably not going to be what you expect.  There's some really intense flying in the opening few minutes, but the rest of the movie is about a pilot dealing with substance addiction.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is definitely the favorite of all the free online books I have read.  It is escape romance at its finest. It has some interesting twists and turns and lots of passion that every woman wants. Very enjoyable...thank you.
B00947N6UG|4.0|A nice entertaining story with good animation.  The story was originally released in theaters in the holiday season, and since the story revolves around characters like Jack Frost and Santa Claus, it's probably most enjoyable to view it during the holiday season.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I am very pleased with the quality of this case. It stands up nicely and can be dropped without worry.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I don't know how accurate the movie is, but it does paint an interesting story about an important historical event.  Entertaining viewing.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Very good but the special effects were not as good as the Lord of the Rings.,better in blue ray disc.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I had pre-ordered and then canceled after finding only the 3D Blu-ray was included! The extra $5 that most combo sets get was not enough for the greedy people at Disney! Let them keep it!!
B001HLZMUE|5.0|Now I don't have to go on an hour trek to go to the live showing!<br />I've had viewing parties every friday night and had plenty of fun with it.<br />Would definitely recommend it. &#60;3

B0000CABBW|5.0|I was very impressed with the value this movie showed. Again this is a movie girls should watch and know they to can do it no matter what it takes
B0041KVV8U|5.0|Great album, contains great songs and brings great memories back.  Consists of non album tracks that otherwise you can't have
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This is a great series that has been diminished by Amazon's censorship. Buyer beware! You can buy he DVD and watch the unadulterated version.
B000007492|5.0|Great album and great songs!!  I would add &#34;Lord is it Mine&#34; as it is a classic to me, although I would not consider it a big hit
B000FC10MU|4.0|Got this for a cross country train ride, expecting it to last. Wrong!  Burned through it quickly.<br /><br />Go for it.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I choose this dictionary because it helped me when I didn't understand what the meaning of a word when I didn't know  what that word means.
0898159156|3.0|This is great book for a beginning carnivorous plant collector.  It helps identify the different species of carnivorous plants and brief description.  It has great pictures and very helpful for finding the requirements that the plants need.
B002Z7FWBI|4.0|the set is missing  Magnum Force.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  I enjoyed the ones I did yet
B005Z28M58|4.0|The desperate housewives from Westeria Lane are back and boy, are they!<br />New characters enter and old ones are sorely missed. If you have a sentimental (!!!??) attachment to Susan's husband Mike Dephino, you will be saddened to see him murdered in episode 'Women and Death'. Why? Well, only Mark Cherry can answer that question convincingly, or then, maybe not!<br />I somehow feel that this particular series is not at par with the other 7 seasons. Series 8 is all about the disillusionment and the disappointment in the lives of most residents of Wisteria Lane. Why Mark Cherry chose to come up with a disappointing end to a great series, beats me. Even Mark Cherry, who makes a brief guest appearance in the last episode, carrying a packing case to the moving van, appears glum/dejected. Why, if you ask me, would a personnel from a moving company look glum?<br />A not so great finale to the Desperate Housewives and their idiosyncratic behaviour. Yet, I will miss them!<br />I still don't get it why ABC Studios have not released this series on Blu ray. Maybe they have a reason, but what the heck, it ain't good enough!<br /><br />BR
0465068367|5.0|This is a book that everyone in America should read.  It should be an academic requirement for all.  It's an incredible story depicting the best and worst of human nature.  Sadism and compassion dramatically confronting each other at an isolated period of time and place.  It's an event that should never have happened;  truly a black mark on all of human history.  Iris Chang gave this book her heart and soul.  She left us a legacy of truth and knowledge about an event that had been largely ignored by western history.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Finally a good free game that lets progression happen without spending real money. A great couple times a day app.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|A little too corny for me.<br /><br />Denzel use to be more good looking too in previous movies. He plays an overweight drunk in this one.
B000CNE092|5.0|My Daughter in law is collecting great movies for her children, this one is one of favorites. A girl who finds her way and saves her self.
B009EFP278|5.0|This is the first time I have heard of this artist.  Saw him perform on the talk shows and liked his music.  Sounds a little like Maroon 5.  Talented artist.  Look forward to hearing more music from Olly Murs.
0812550706|5.0|lot's of people have already written good reviews so i will jsut say that i would recomend it to any sci fi fan.
B00005K424|3.0|The main issue I found with this travel version was the fact that it was not magnetic and I thought it would be. As it's for travel, it would make much more sense if it was magnetic. However, when playing at home, it works just fine and the smaller size of the game is actually a bonus for storage and table space.
B003UBTX72|5.0|An amazing insight of one of most influential musicians of our time. It gave me an even more deeper appreciation of The Rolling Stones and of the music that influenced them.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I tried to get it but it wouldn't let me<br />So don't get this game because it happened to my friend
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I'm becoming fond of the g5 games.  This one was pretty good decent graphics and the HO was challenging enough to keep me entertained.  As long as the price on these stay low I look forward to more of them.
B005D6O0LQ|4.0|Fit great love style, little disappointed in shade of navy instead of being true dark navy they are on the purple navy side
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is such a hilarious and heartfelt storyteller.  I identified with her to such a degree I'm somewhat concerned because I am a 26 year old male.  Nonetheless a truly funny and never boring book of life and how to be a woman in a male driven society.
B004LP10PO|2.0|I have a relatively new relatively new BluRay by Samsung but two of the discs just bought stuck throughout the movie.<br />Are the movies purchased of poorer quality?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|IT IS SO MUCH FUN THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT. It is so addicting and so time consuming but I know your like it
B0049M7BDE|2.0|I bought both the older and newer versions of this movie and although I have a relatively new BluRay by Samsung there were points of interruption in both of the DVDs.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Would not recommend this book to anybody! Please do not waste your money. There is no real plot, the chapters are very repetitive and boring. The story is pathetic and predictable.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire wouldn't hold a charge, so Ashley sent me a replacement charger connection and adaptor.  Even thought it didn't solve the problem - my Kindle Fire ultimately had to be replaced, I truly appreciate the wonderful customer service from Ashley and from Amazon on this issue.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|It is great to read an author who gets to the end of a long series and things logically fall into place
B007NQNRPO|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, but was put off by the alien part and the rough sex scene, but other than that it was fine.
B0015FML06|5.0|Red Rocks was a defining moment for the young U2 and I've already written a separate review about how excellent the DVD is. The EP itself is quite short, with only eight songs being included (and only \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Party Girl\\" are actually from the Red Rocks concert) but don't let that fool you: it's well worth picking up. From the fiery renditions of \\"The Electric Co.\\" and \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" to the uplifting singalong of \\"40\\", this is vintage U2 that any fan or newcomer should immediately delve into. The EP and the concert are not to be missed and pack just as much of a punch now as they did in 1983.<br /><br />This band is truly timeless and this still stands as one of their most beloved and endearing works.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I loved the tv show and still and I enjoyed it and watching it :) I would recommend it to anybody who was interested in seeing it .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This  is both free and great to play!I would try it out if I were you! Like I said great game!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I spend more time playing this game than I should. It is addictive and time consuming. A couple of times, for some reason the keyboard popped up and obscured the screen. I deleted the game and later reinstalled it and so far it is working well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Meets my needs for a basic calculator.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a calculator that does the job without distracting
B00275EGX8|5.0|The action was out of this world. I would recommend this to everyone to buy and watch it. 5-Stars *****
B00A83075M|5.0|I purchased this as a  gift for a 8 year old for her Birthday. I found out at the last minute that this was the only thing she wanted and so I ordered it but it arrived a day to late. I have Amazon Prime but I was giving them less than 24 hours to ship it so it was totally might fault also Amazon has gotten things to me in one day! They are Awesome.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|I love this app! If you have a kindle fire like me all you have to do is search for the video you want, then tap and hold your video and save it as the selection:<br /> 114p mpeg 3gpp,<br />(the longer the video the longer the download) you can also exit the app while downloading. When the download is complete you can find the video in the app 'Gallery' it comes with the kindle fire and it saves pictures. I recomend this app for everyone and I hope my instructions helped anyone having troubles.
1452110581|5.0|I read the book  while a guest. It was on the  bedside table. I couldn't wait to get home and order one for a cat loving friend. She was thrilled and hysterical. It is a must for cat lovers.
0425264351|5.0|I am officially a Lee Child/Jack Reacher convert. This book is my idea of a page turner/pulse raising thriller. I agree there are a few plot points to nit pick about, but who cares, my Mom was right, I think I am really going to enjoy this series.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Movie should be great, although the terms may be different. Can't wait for the next book. I'm glad I read it.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This album gets better everytime you listen to it. its unique and great fun for listening while doing alomost anything.
0670026603|5.0|This story touched my heart and came close to home.  A heart wrenching love story with the knowledge that sometimes love means letting go.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love the puzzles!  Difficult enough to make you really think about it but not so difficult that you always need hints or want to give up.  I t was great!  I can't wait for the next one!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Finally Khaled Hosseini returns.  I feared I wouldn't like this book as much as I liked The Kite Runner or Thousand Splendid Suns.  I didn't.  I loved it more.  I had to stop myself from reading so I didn't finish it too fast and not get to live with the characters any longer.  I was saddened not to get to learn more about their lives.  I definitely cried.  But it was such a heartwarming book.  Thank you Khaled for this wonderful book you've written.
B0064QNS62|3.0|not sure about it. haven't played it a lot. too busy watching &#34;justified&#34;!!!!!  maybe i will get a chance later on.  too many words required.hahaha
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it!!! It is very addictive, but yet relaxing at the end of the day. I play every chance that I get!
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This appears to be a nice little app (from the reviews I've read).  I own a Kindle Fire HD.  I recognize that this app really wasn't designed for my device.  As others have stated, it's amazing that so many have complained about this app not working well with their Kindle.<br /><br />I have a piece of advice:  Be patient.  I think it is just a matter of time before Amazon develops a Kindle with a rear facing camera.  Many folks have expressed their dismay that the current model Kindle Fire HD has only a front facing camera.  Amazon is probably listening and I suspect the next model Kindle will include a front and rear facing camera.<br /><br />Just for fun, I did a test run with my Kindle Fire HD.  This App really does work on the Kindle Fire HD (however, it is awkward). The instructions in the \\"Help\\" section of this app are very simple. Sharing and exporting images is easy. Obviously, good lighting is essential to capturing good images.  There are options for image quality, image enhancement and color or black and white. I took a random photograph of a document.  E-mailing the image was extremely simple.  I sent the image to myself and the image integrity was excellent.<br /><br />Kindle users, if you really want this App, you can can add it to your wish list for future purchase. Or, you could even buy it now for limited use. Either way, when the new Kindle Fire comes out with a rear facing camera (and if you plan to upgrade)... you'll be ready.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is something I enjoy and so do both of my kids. GREAT app! It's nice to have an app that is calming and educational.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new update to this game is really good.  I highly recommend!  Prior to the update, the only thing that you really had to keep cognizant of was the speed of the game.  Now, the obstacles are more difficult, which makes the game a lot more fun.
B004TFLYRA|5.0|I realy enjoyed the whole book and I am looking forward to your next book.<br />My name is Zac Lewis<br /><br />Thanks for the book Anthony
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I got this free game and its amazing! I easily got every shark including the megaladon. (Bigger than great white) the mega eats boats, mines and jellyfish! :O okay, so it does take a while to get some coins for sharks, but I beat it easily and maxed out all my sharks by buying the double coin thing, it doubles what you earn each game making it way easier. And it only costs 0.99$, it's a good deal. You should buy this amazing game! It is also free of adds which is awesome! TOTALLY BUY IT! LIKE, SERIOUSLY, ITS FREE AND ITS AMAZING!!!<br />*&deg;-&deg;*
B005W0ARFQ|5.0|The intriguing Bernie Gunther weaves a tale of drama entwined with historical fact and a touch of romance. The worst of human nature is rent against the engaging character of BG as he tries to make sense of the web of deceit and moral depravity that engulfs him. Did you ever wonder how humanity could be so evil? Let Bernie unveil insights into the darkest reaches of our souls. Somber insights that  cause grave discomfort but in an entertaining and cathartic way. Philip Kerr through his character Bernie Gunther takes you and your conscience on an emotional but not to be missed ride.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Let me count the ways!  This is a wonderful version of the classic musical, and viewing it is like coming home. I dare anyone to watch Anne Hathaway's performance without crying, or to listen to Russell Crowe's croaking without close to the same reaction. Don't expect the voices from Broadway, except for the elderly bishop who portrayed Jean Val Jean on Broadway. The staging is lovely and, of course, the story is first rate!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Awesome game daughter and I are hooked. We don't buy anything for it so she learns patience. We love my little pony. Cool little game.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|It is well written, upbeat, and the creation of someone who should know how to rise to the top! It should be a must-read for young female graduates as they enter into the dog-eat-dog world of American business!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I've seen a ton of movies in my day and this one moved right up to #3 on my list, under Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Almost Famous. Just hilarious and really, Rebel Wilson? How can you go wrong?
B002SSUQFG|1.0|... it just wouldn't stay running. Wore it for a day, went to bed and six hours later it had stopped. Repeated with the same result. Shook it back and forth while on my wrist for a minute, swirled it like a glass of bourbon in my hand for a few minutes more, and two-and-a-half hours later it had stopped again. Returned it for an Eco-Drive. Hope I have better luck with it.
B009POHHRG|3.0|All around the book was good, but I was a little disappointed at the length. I shot through this in under half an hour. Only half the book is actually the Joker story people wanted to see. The  art work and story is fantastic although short. For that reason I would recommend the hard copy of the book, as oppose to digital, to leave in the bathroom or on a coffee table for guests to read.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Gave as a gift to daughter. She was thrilled. No problems inserting batteries, etc. She is very happy with this product.
B009R659L8|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  So many twists and turns that it kept me guessing to the end. And character development that makes the people come to life.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Bought as a gift for parents. They love it. The only problem they have is getting it back from grandkids who have borrowed the set and are now hooked as well.
B009CVAUIU|3.0|I'm an author with over 18 stories published, never to be Pulitzer material but entertaining and I'm proud of my work. I read this book because it was a Pulitzer winner; most authors read a lot to improve their writing. I'm also a paid editor for a publisher.<br /><br />First, it's a good book, but I was left wondering why it won a Pulitzer. The other reviews, before mine, are accurate in description of the plot so I won't repeat it takes place in North Korea, etc. As much as the story notes the N. Korean regieme accusing the USA of being a propoganda machine and terror to the world, this book seems almost like propoganda. Maybe it's accurate; no way to know. I think a short preface to the book would be helpful to state the details of brutality, hunger and poverty are accurate; or exagerated, like is often done on TV and the movies.<br /><br />As an author, I keep pen and paper with me as I read to write great words or phrases to borrow (this is often done; not plagerism). I only wrote two things from this book. I enjoyed reading the book, but sometimes/often had to re-read because of jumps in the story. I think there's a believability issue when a common N. Korean citizen is allowed on a diplomatic/political mission to visit a senator from Texas, and the same common citizen (an orphan of sorts, an insult and lower class status)ends up associating with the leader of N. Korea.<br /><br />When I read Alan Chin's \\"A Lonely War\\" a few years ago I wrote four pages of useful, sometimes awesome, words and phrases that have enhanced my writing. I've re-read Mr. Chin's book and intend to buy more of his works. Note: He's not a friend or relative, he just's a great writer and I think \\"The Lonely War\\" would be better than this book I'm reviewing. Just my opinion. I pride myself on being fair and honest.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />David Sullivan
B00CBUL826|3.0|I've been a Sodom fan since 'Persecution Mania' came out, but that doesn't mean I have to LOVE everything they release. This latest release falls into a similar trapping that the latest Destruction releases are...they are forgettable. Their signature thrash sounds are all intact, but the songwriting just isn't generating the same classic riffs that made them so great. By no means are their releases bad, they just aren't sticking to my ribs. Just my opinion...
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is an awesome game. it's never boring and its free.you will not waste your time or money on this game.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This is one of those films like 'Sophie's Choice' that really makes you contemplate the horrific nature of life when fate intervenes forcing one to make a decision that proves disastrous and irredeemable.  And of course throughout the film you are in suspense as to how the hellish dilemma will be resolved if in fact it ever is.  Life can really throw some nightmarish curve balls at you as this film shows.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I believe that this is the best shooting game out there. Great graphics, gameplay and multiplayer. Ans best of all, the don't ask you to buy anything, because you can get everything in the game if you play for it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have watched at least 3 seasons of this show on this venue...glad  to have access loved it!!  Thanks for the access to the earlier series.
B00C2VIA52|1.0|I completely hated it. After a few campaign battles.it becomes impossible to simply win. The only way in which you can win is by buying materials that cost you money. Multiplayer is filled with players who have malevolent the game an  have amazing cards, so multiplayer  gone too. All in all terrible game
B005PK57IK|5.0|This series came highly recommended by a few friends- never had time to watch when it was actually on, browsing the titles one day I found the beginning of the series and got caught up watching episode after episode.  Great Series!!!  Luv it!!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I really enjoyed watching season 1 of Eurea. It reminded of the reason I fell in love with when it was originally on the study channel.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|It was beyond my expectation, I was just looking forward to some more excellent music but to see them play was just an added unexpected bonus and all for mothers day :D
B009JZPH32|1.0|I watched maybe 15 minutes of this film before I lost interest and left it playing in the background.<br />None of the characters are particularly likeable and the story isn't engaging either. Save yourself the time and money, the preview is truly the best of the film...<br /><br />Honestly, I found myself wanting the three main characters to get killed off...I'm pretty sure that wasn't the desired effect.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Found the book to be a bit different from other NDE books in that there was a tie to life before and after the experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Again this game is free and fun. perfect! I enjoy the task and many other things about it! Also it is addictive but not too much to keep you up all night. I think you should definetly get it. ;)
B004TI5N38|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. First time reading David Baldacci...now I find I am downloading a lot of his books...love his writing...
B009NY43NY|4.0|I liked it. Have read all others. Will miss Sookie, but don't know why??? I find these books entertaining, but don't know why.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love Pinterest but the app constantly freezes and often does not even load. There's obviously  not much fun in that so I use Pinterest a lot less than I otherwise would. Please fix it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like solving puzzles then this game is for you!  This is just the kind of game I had been looking for...challenging, puzzle solving fun!  I highly recommend The Room and am looking forward to more from this company!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Every patriotic American must read this story. I don't usually write reviews, but this personal account from Mr. Luttrell opened my eyes to the brutal intensity of being a Navy SEAL operator and I believe if you find something good - you tell people about it. I have always respected our heroes of the military, but the supreme depth of the love for country, brothers in arms, and courage of these guys is beyond inspiring and this story truely influenced my life. The story just flows into your head and leaves you in awe in so many different arenas. From Luttell's upbringing, to trying to make the teams, to deployment, to the drama of Murphy's ridge and then back home, the detail and way this story reads is incredible. Chock-full of humor, sentiment, smart-ass remarks, honor and action it's a great view into the life of one hero out of very many.
B00004U3UG|5.0|Bruce Campbell is hilarious. The film is great full of amazing one liners. I did wish it had more special features.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|It's lots of fun the whole family gathers round to play.  Would recommend for all ages.  Frustrating at times but lots of fun.
1400069807|5.0|This is a great, well written book that details what goes on behind the scenes in making food and drink in the US and how that has contributed to increased rates of obesity and cancer in the country. The truth is delivered through strong anecdotes and insider interviews. Every American should read this!
B000000OU0|5.0|This is an excellent album. Classic Eagles. Songs to think about. Love it. Would buy it again. Everyone should own it.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Few bands can pull off making an album this good especially after losing an iconic lead singer & being together over 20 years. This album is probably one of best rock albums i've heard in a long time on par with Dirt and even some ways exceeds it. The harmonies and guitar riffs are amazing. The opening track Hollow pretty much sets the tone of album, lots of hard & heavy songs and no filler songs at all.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Its the best game on the tablet since dead trigger they really should have more games like this worth all the money
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This keeps me busy for hours! I keep saying, just one more level!! LOL Looking forward to the next level...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played. My nephew was letting me play on his I pad. I was thrilled when it became available for the kindle fire. Very engrossing. I highly recommend this game.
B0068AWO00|5.0|I have been wanting to watch this for a long time now and I finally got my chance; I was not disappointed. I am a Colin Farrell fan and he did not disappoint. He made a very believable vampire. And I love how they made the vampires out to be in this movie: blood thirsty creatures who look as though they are possessed by demons instead of the typical ridiculously handsome young people whose only vampire trait is the changing of the color of their eyes (I'm talking to you Twilight and Vampire Diaries). Anton Yelchin is really good as the main character, and David Tennant is perfect in the role of the weird Las Vegas performer. But it is Colin who gives the kick-butt performance. So if you want a good vampire film that has some funny and scary moments, then this is the one for you. Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Here needs to be horses in minecraft in 2013 on all versions. I mean there needs to be horses and HORSE stuff cause I'm a huge horse fan
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the bomb.com!! you can go on creative and survival! well duh. but is there melons on here??????? i cant find them!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Super fun game. I like building my own city. I also like the little trucks rolling by each building. I recommend this game to a lot of people.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|All I can say is... WHEN does the next season begin! This show is addicting! If you buy the season you'll be hooked!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe puts out another great CD!! It's amazing how he never stops working and everything he puts out is AWESOME!!! Just saw him recently in Milwaukee and opened the show with acoustic set that was amazing! The total show was 2 hours 20 minutes, non stop!! Truly a great show!!!
B009ERK1T0|4.0|THERE IS A LOT OF POINTLESS SCREAMING. THE WHITE PONY IS STUNNING BY SOUND AND THIS IS SIMILAR, I HAVE TO BE IN THE MOOD. I DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE MOOD TO LISTEN TO \\"PASSENGER\\" OR \\"RX QUEEN\\" OR \\"DIGITAL BATH\\" THIS IS A SOLID EFFORT THOUGH.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Surviving this horrific experience over such a long time is truly beyond belief. It is a story of courage, fear, tenderness, hate.....a true mixed bag.  It is quite inspirational to know how she and her girls have adapted and flourished after going through such an ordeal
B000L3CHC0|5.0|Really it´s a good choice for men who like hard work, sports, partys; strong and elegance; all in one. Five stars.
B008DKBO8G|5.0|The sleeve looks classy and protects my Kindle very well. I like the black color and find it easy to carry.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My 5 year old and 9 year old love this app.  There is enough to keep them interested and easy enough to advance to next level to keep them playing.  Nice app and we'll done.
6305428352|5.0|I love the premise of this story that what really matters in this life is how we touch and help others.  It is not about fame in the eyes of the world.<br /><br />Sharon V.W.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|In Shai, Sanderson has created a character who is compelling and completely believable. Shai is more than merely a forger, she is an artist.  She takes pride in her work, and rightfully so. The way she is portrayed is a departure for Sanderson, in that she is most definitely a woman, and she is the central figure. There is a strong sense of history to this tale, and the structure of their society is clearly drawn in only a few well-crafted words.<br /><br />Shai is thief, but not just any kind of a thief. Shai has been trained to forge a replica of the original item to leave in its place. Her replicas are masterful. in many ways her replicas are better than the originals. The power of her work as she remakes her surroundings she amazes him, and every day he is more confused by her. This is not a love story--Gaotona struggles to understand why an artist of her caliber, who loves the craft as much as she does prostitutes her gift by making forgeries.<br /><br />Two factions now control her fate. They have something she needs, and she has something they need, but for how long? The Emperor Ashravan's condition has opened up new possibilities for some on the council, and they are ruthless. Shai is safe for the moment, but she knows her life hangs by a thread and only a miracle will save her.<br /><br />She is locked in a room, and you only leave that room through the objects and the memories she is forging. Yet Sanderson manages to convey not only who she is, but who Councillor Gaotona is, who the Emperor Ashravan is as a man, and what the current state of the political world is. He shows you the world around her and you see those who would rule and the decaying empire they would commit any atrocity to control.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It is high fantasy at it's best, and you will not be disappointed!
B000VWODZ0|4.0|Great infill for my Clapton collection. Promises remains one of my all-time Clapton favs, and still love to sing along to Watch Out For Lucy.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|useful, simple, easy. helps keep track of the barage of things I browse online. love this app, works seamlessly on the kindle fire.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|HAVE ALL  THE ''EAGLES'' CDs & DVDs..but never really knew about the breakup and the turmoil with the group..NOW HAVE IT ALL!!!  GREAT D V Ds  DAWN DOREY
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Cool app. Sure you can take pics with your camera anytime the real feature of this app is the simplicity of converting to a PDF. For all the people complaining about it not working on your Kindle fire, duh...you have no rear camera. A lot of regular Android phone and tablet users use the Amazon app store if not just for the free app each day. I must say I like the the Amazon store also saves any free apps I download, so I can reload them again simply if I need to.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Interesting and warmly dark. Full of twists and turns and a lot of mystery. A great read for stormy days.
B009GEOLM4|1.0|Did not enjoy the style of animation and the voices weren't very convincing.  Would not recommend to a friend or fan.
B0007TKNII|4.0|The CD arrived quickly and it was in excellent shape. Thanks for the good service. The film is quite well done. I used it for a student audience, and it held their attention.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|This is my favorite of the trilogy.  RDJ's sarcasm and wit is unparalleled in this film.  The addition of Don Cheadles works well
067144901X|5.0|Cute kids' book with great illustrations.  Fun to read and fund to look at with an unexpected twist to it.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal is a fantastic show. The acting is superb, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the writing is constantly gripping. The intensity felt in the show has not let up yet, even after 10 episodes. I'm always at the edge of my seat. If you have reservations about the violence and blood, just know that they aren't there for entertainment, so much as to show the emotional and psychological consequences they have on the main characters. It's truly a great show, and I'm incredibly grateful to be able to watch something as quality as this on regular tv.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|1. Document scanner apps scan documents using a camera.<br /><br />2. It's not impossible, but is difficult to do that with the front facing camera.<br /><br />3. There are people who would blame the Ritz for not having an interstate shuttle bus to pick them up in Maui.<br /><br />4. Not quite five but a solid four. I want to help offset Maui dude though.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like the Afgani rug weavers Hosseini knows how to weave and beautiful tale.  All is his books are important for Americans to read.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Not a true page- turner, but enjoyed every minute and was sorry when it was done. Great on the IPad.
B00CNEEQAG|5.0|Given \\"Soothe My Soul\\"'s video's precipitous release for the U.S. market, I'd say Columbia wanted to dig up some radio play that might have been lacking from the first single as such \\"Heaven\\". Personally I think these mixes do make the cut (at least we are not stuck listening to \\"It's No Good\\"'s (BONG26) trough of terrible ungrooveable mixes (excepted the Club69 mix which only came out on white label sadly). \\"Soothe My Soul\\" is simple to get to know and to like. It's 'b' side (on the 2-track CDS) \\"Goodbye\\" is by Gesaffelen whom made a remarkable mix for moby's single \\"The Day\\". He's come up with the good goods for Depeche as well happily. Note, the album mix od \\"Soothe My Soul\\" which doesn't feature on these cds is probably the best version, tho Lu Cont's panagyric does come close. I'm crossing my fingers, legs, arms, and whatever else is left of me that album track \\"Broken\\" will hopefully be an upcoming single. It has so much Depeche Canon riding on it... Heavy canon. I can feel the emotion of the track settling on my shoulders each time I hear it. It makes me feel both sad and happy with a mixture of other emotions each time I take it in. Gahan's vocals have become something higher, rawer on this album. He sounds like some kind of slithering Soulman. The way he almost says the 's' in the word feels on the second verse of \\"Soothe My Soul\\" \\"I need to feel(s) your skin\\" is an almost deliberate mistake that somehow gells the track to perfection for me each listen I take in. Delta Machine is their best album I think. It's sound so raw, original, the album is listenable all the way thru without missing a track. Each listen thru I take in. It certainly gives 1990's Violator(STUMM64)a run for it's sound, and with the second 4-track deluxe version cd, it's twice as long, twice as good.<br />I recommend the new album and for those whom didn't quite get first single \\"Heaven\\"(a track that doesn't represent the sound of Delta at all, tho still a nice ballad, esp with it's video)then \\"Soothe My Soul\\" well makes up for it. I just wish the album had come out in 5.1 Surround Sound as well as all of DM's earlier albums have now been remastered up to and as Playing the Angel and Sounds of the Universe were upon their release. I like (re)discovering all of those hidden sounds over six channels. Five stars in my opinion for both the album and for these two \\"Soothe my Soul\\" CDs/MP3s.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The title of the post says it all.  An enjoyable and a fast paced read.  Morgan keeps multiple story lines moving forward without the book feeling broken up or too complex.  A good plot, but you can be left wanting a bit more as there are some places where the story feels a bit rushed.  Despite the reviews of contradictions or grammar, I still found it enjoyable and worth the time and low cost.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|My wife loved this so much she completely crushed the whole season in a few days. It must have been great.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This game is pretty okay.  It works well on my Kindle and I have a good time playing it.  Have fun!
B00CRMWMZ0|2.0|I bought it on the strength of Get Lucky and was really disappointed. I'm sure it will find an audience, but it really misses the mark from where they've been in the past.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I just didn't care for this game.  I worked fine on my phone, I'm just not a fan.  Sorry I can't be more helpful.  :)
B00CJ32S74|5.0|It has a wide variety of genres and just fit together so well and I loved what i heard when i saw the movie

1583334386|5.0|Many of us feel that we don't accomplish certain things because we generally lack willpower or lack it in those crucial moments when something needs to be done or avoided.  In this enlightening and entertaining book, psychology instructor Kelly McGonigal explains all the nuances of willpower, including it's breaking down into both \\"want\\" and \\"won't\\" power.  This is the book version of her hugely popular course at Stanford University.  McGonigal explains some of the counterintuitive ways that willpower works or is affected.  For example, showing graphic images of smoking-induced cancer may actually increase smoking.  Why?  Because those images cause stress in the smoker and what do smokers due to calm down?  Smoke!  Also, doing something good gives a person license to then do something bad.  Just gave a homeless person some change?  Your next move may be to use office supplies for personal use.  I am only giving a surface treatment here of the points made, obviously, but the book is rich in detail explaining why these behavioral phenomena exist.  Interestingly to me, some of McGonigal's claims seem to run counter to some claims from behavioral economics.  For example, the latter claims that placing healthy food items in a prominent location makes people eat more healthy and less junk food.  McGonigal shows that in some cases simply placing health food on a fast food menu increases the sale of unhealthy food.  Why?  Because people give themselves a sort of healthy thinking \\"credit\\" and thus license to misbehave.  I'd like to see how these viewpoints get reconciled.<br /><br />I had a very interesting experience myself while reading the book.  I totally pigged out on sweets, soda and other junk.  Why?  Because I figured, with all the willpower knowledge I was gaining, I would more than make up for it after I finished reading the book.  I may have also been motivated by all the stories of willpower failures.  Nevertheless, I do think that this book will go far in helping many people achieve their goals.  They just have to finish the book quickly.<br /><br />One other bonus with this book:  the author has a great sense of humor and her jokes throughout the book are quite funny.  Whatever.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I've been waiting for months for this book to come out and I couldn't be more pleased! I loved the way the author drags you in by the first page. The book was finished two days later. :) Bravo to you Ms. Harris on such a fascinating ending to a great series!!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|While I admire his skill with words, I'm sorry to say this is an old story that keeps getting rewritten. I felt like I was reading &#34; Sleeping With The Enemy&#34; & Katie/Erin was Julia Roberts. I've read every one of Nicholas Sparks' books and will probably read a few more in the future until I realize he's become a male Danielle Steele.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Can't put it down - a very powerful narrative with some very profound observations. Gives a new meaning to &#34;brave&#34;
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A truly breathtaking first hand account of the bin Laden raid. These guys never get the credit they deserve, but well done gentlemen. God bless America.
0142403873|5.0|My son loves this story. When this got to the house, I believe we read it for a solid 2 weeks every night before bed. Unlike other children's stories that seem like afterthoughts, this is well written and enjoyable to read time and again.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is a highly entertaining, thought-provoking movie. Watched Before Sunrise and Sunset several times. Great performances by Hawke and Delpy. Can't wait to see Before Midnight.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is highly recommended for those who want to see if they can crack the safe. This game is awesome,and very addictive.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|One of the worst app purchases. I used to have this on my ipad and it worked great. But this port of the game is super buggy. Played it for about 5 minutes and deleted it.  meh...
B0058SNIC6|5.0|Simple black slip on, comfy for walking shorter distances (less than a mile). I am not a fan of adults in crocs, these however are pretty cute for a rubber made shoe:). Awesome for camping, great shower shoe. Easy to keep clean!!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|You kinda get hooked on the game even tho it's so repetitive. I think the great graphics, control, and performance of this polished game make it so great. Great way to kill time and hone your tablet driving skills.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This is an engaging book in a well-written series of novels by the British author.  I highly recommend the 'Clifton Chronicles.'
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|This album is simply put, wonderful. For those of us who have taste that goes beyond normal radio, these is a must-hear. Laura's voice can be powerful yet delicate. I highly recommend this to any music snob or jazz fan. I have gifted this album to old and young alike and always receive many thanks for alerting people to such a beautiful alternative to what pop culture advertises.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|This is such an awesome game.  You control Hambo Pig as he battles the enemy (other pigs) while searching for his friend, Bacon.  But be aware this is more of a physics strategy game than a shoot-em-up game.  Each level is a maze of obstacles and enemy pigs.  You must figure out how to shoot the enemy pigs without killing yourself with ricocheting bullets.<br /><br />Pros:<br />&#10004 The graphics are really great.  Lots of little details that make you laugh (like the enemy pigs exploding into cans of spam).<br />&#10004 The physics of the ballistics is spot-on.  The bullets always go where you want them to, and they bounce off of walls in interesting ways.<br />&#10004 The levels are very interesting and imaginative.  You can tell that a lot of thought went into the design of the battlegrounds.<br />&#10004 Some of the levels are difficult to figure out, but don't get frustrated because there is a FREE option to \\"view solution\\".  Great feature.<br /><br />Cons:<br />&#10008 The only nitpick I have about this game is that Hambo can't move on his own.  He can slide  down icy patches and drop through broken platforms but you can't move him around to get a better shooting angle.  Another nit is that the enemy doesn't shoot back.  But these are just minor things in an otherwise excellent game.<br /><br />So in summary this is a wonderful game.  Fun, entertaining, and well worth double the asking price.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Good ---not as great as when the songs are played in background.Will get season 11 when it comes out.Worth the modest price.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The Voyager headset is excellent but really needs a case if you're going to drag it around with you. This case is not only perfectly designed, it carries up to three recharges for your headset and recharges the headset every time you put it in the case. There are also two LEDs that tell you the current charge of both the case and the headset. This is a very excellently designed product and I'd recommend it highly to anyone using a Plantronics Voyager headset.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not too bad at all. It's quite an interesting read if you can go through the first few pages without getting bored. Seems a bit unreal to me since people don't necessarily bet to get married in order to prove some point to their friends. Otherwise, the book is nice.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|it is really scary sometimes I have to turn it off because slender is so scary if you like scathe stuff this is the perfect game

B006LSZECO|3.0|After all the fuss I was expecting better. Still a fun read - wish I had saved it for an airplane or the beach.
0756665949|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for a friend who was a big Lost fan and she thoroughly enjoyed it. A nice large book with plenty of info.
031603438X|5.0|Excellent story that was so easy to follow and read. Clear, concise writing style and full of wonderful details about the music industry and Keith's personal life.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I have used many other document scanner apps, and this one is by far the best I've used. Very simple and clean interface. Fast processing through many documents. Ability to enhance and send document through many options of apps. Highly recommended!
0061537969|4.0|Nice book from a dog's point of view. I felt compelled to read the story, and liked the author's style of developing a mystery. I liked the mystery and the positive ending. I disliked the focus on car racing details.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim because the description  intrigued me. I thought it was going to be just another Harlequin romance novel but the plot was different and entertaining. It had my attention right from the beginning.
B007RJTHXS|5.0|This movie is uplifting and makes you smile, no matter when you watch it! A setting in time around London, yet timeless too.
B006T3RM08|5.0|I don't know what some of the folks are complaining about but the Clique is fantastic! The quality of the case is great. The keyboard and the trackpad fit inside the case extremely well. The 2 buttons that allow you acces to the power buttons on the keyboard and the trackpad are a brilliant idea. I'm using the Clique to consolidate the keyboard and the trackpad for my HTPC and it works really well. Once in the case, the whole unit feels nice and solid, yet light. The white color of the Clique makes the whole setup look like a stock Apple product, which is nice visually. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product and I would highly recommend it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Definitely a mind bender and addicting! Worth the $! I wish there were other games like this!!! I would certainly buy them :)
B001EBROWQ|5.0|I can't say anything more to add to that. And I mean the story, not necessarily the movie; though I did think it was one of Max von Sydow's best films.
B004U52VPS|3.0|My kids love it. No worse and no better than similar.  Honestly I would not refuse to buy it cheaper.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I like this game but when I go to select a building or plot it will click a nearby building or something else. I have spaced things out, but really this kills it.
0553062182|4.0|After reading this book I'm certainly a HSP.  The book was informative and gave good examples of how to cope with day to day sensitivity issues.  However I would suggest borrowing from a library if possible (my library didn't own it).  While it is an excellent book, I don't see myself reading it more than once.  It is a lot of background info on being HSP but little I'd need to refer back to.
B00ADS98FC|1.0|Since Amazon no longer has an option to easily contact support and a call number, i have to resort to rating a product low in order to get their attention:<br />I had 10 Instant credit, and i purchased this for 9.99. The credit was not applied to my purchase, and i just got billed for the digital movie, which i would not pay 9.99 for a digital copy had it not been for a credit balance i had stored up.
B000WDSZ8E|4.0|Purchased the pilot online as I was watching the episodes in repeats and the channel I was watching skipped the pilot episode.  Show is funny; earlier seasons are better than later ones.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is really fun. I usually don't like 2D retro games but this is really great. I cannot get enough of it that I play during  class.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Simply could not put  it down.  Not as scary as the ominous cover would have you anticipate, but intriguing all the same.  I look forward to the sequel, as I am captivated with the peculiar an  fancy more secrets to be revealed.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This is a book/series that I absolutely loved. That said, it fits my taste and most of this series would be unpalatable to most people. I found this book while looking for something to read after finishing the Game of Thrones series and Kingkiller Chronicles. The book reads kind of like Game of Thrones except with about 100 less characters and no one is particularly likeable. Where Game of Thrones is full of characters that are flawed but you love any ways, The Blade Itself is full of characters that are flawed in an all too realistic way leaving them slightly less loveable. The violence is on a whole different level than most books. I love a bit of good violence in my media but there were moments in this series that made me cringe, in a good way. I really enjoy Joe Abercrombie's writing in regards to flow. It's easy to read, like a Brandon Sanderson book.<br /><br />If all of that sounds like the sort of thing that would tickle you then give this book a try.
B001AUKUUO|5.0|had this on cassette when it came out in '87,so glad to have foun it on cd,no music collection is complete if you don't have this album.

B003V6L94Q|5.0|I was extemely surprised and elated when I hear all the songs on You Get What You Give.  Even my boyfriend, who is not particularly into Country music, appreciated the depth and musicality of this band and album.  It's definitely worth a listen.  I was smiling the entire time the album was playing.

B00CL0J99K|2.0|iron man 3 wasn't the movie i wanted to see. the mandrin was nothing but a shell for a.i.m manipulation and using the extremis formula. the movie i would like to see the mandrin manipulating a.i.m and the vice president using the extremis formula. followed by knock out battle between the mandrin and iron man e.t. tech ( mandrin's rings) against stark tech (iron man armor). the ending of stark no longer being iron man was disappointing just like bruce wayne faking his death in batman3.
B007U2ABXM|4.0|I purchase the item new.<br />Happy because the deluxe edition it´s very fine .<br />little book , hard cover , with pictures in black and white ...<br />the album it´s very good . sounds very well .<br />Patti´s voice is special , and some songs have an special power ( April´s fool , Amerigo, Fuji San)<br />put special attention over After  the gold rush , Patti´s version , with children chorus ... beautiful performance .<br />I love the Patti´s versions over songs of Neil Young like that, and Helpless in Twelve album , the same in others songs

1609611543|5.0|I own this book both electronically and hard copy.  I bought this copy for a gift. This is the 4th or 5th copy I have bought to give to friends facing health problems from diabetes to hypertension to gluten sensitivity.  We Americans are killing ourselves with the crazy awful wheat laden diet. One of the first things in the book talks about men with man boobs and how these are caused by our genetically modified wheat. I used to tease my husband that his boobs were bigger than mine! One year later, after significantly reducing the refined wheat in our diets, his man boobs have disappeared completely, but don't worry, mine are still there. It was very hard to change in the beginning because it seemed like every seasoning or dressing or recipe I used had a wheat product in it but now preparing our meals wheat free is just second nature.  At 56, my blood pressure is 121/67. My cholesterol is within the normal range after ditching statin drugs.  This book can ignite the fire to change your life by stopping poisoning yourself with GMO wheat.

B00A7W29BE|5.0|I have had this for 4 hours and I am already convinced that it is better than the other three scanner apps that I have on HTC One. The pdf that it create is surprisingly clear and readable.  The ability to scan and upload multiple pages to dropbox is invaluable to me as a teacher. Just get it!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I didn't even know it was used when I watched it.<br />It was the best quality even though it said that it was used
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Great app. Great physics. Beautifully designed. The tilt gets a little annoying because I don`t know what I am doing that causes it. Seems like maybe it is too sensitive.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awsome and tricky but you get the hang of it after a while :) you sometimes get caught with the time and you never know what's gonna happen next
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The characters are so real in this series. I keep dreaming about them (and me) being in the silo each night.  I usually feel the post apocalyptic genre is over done, but the characters are three dimensional and you care about them and the challenges they are facing. Starting Shift right now!!!

B00BEZTMFY|3.0|This is just ok. The trilogy was great, of course. The problem here is that the trilogy was 3 movies based on 3 books. This is the first part of a trilogy based on 1 book. Too much extra stuff added in to stretch this to a 3 parter.

B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Movie focuses on Psycho, but is very good and definitely worth seeing, and is especially appealing to me as I was a teenager when Psycho came out, and I remember the hype around the movie and the strict policy about no entry after the movie started, and also remember seeing it back then with a date, and how the audience reacted--especially to that shower scene.
0544002318|5.0|Jurek shares with you is path he took to becoming the runner and person he is today.  Well written and a quick read.  Would recommend.  Getting passed around my running friends right now.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Not up to the standard set by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Ending is not what I remember from the book..seems like they just decided to stop at a certain point, leaving the rest to suggestion/imagination. I like Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch (from BBC's Sherlock),Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Christopher Lee and some of the other actors, but even they can't pull the movie out of the doldroms for me.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|Good insight and reminders.  It should be a wake-up call to many!  The younger generation should read this. (anyone under 30)
1250012570|5.0|*Review posted on Mundie Moms on 5/31/13*<br /><br />Every year since I began reviewing, there seems to be a story that surprises me. It's usually a quietly launched story without a lot of over-hyped buzz, but it picks up steam as it passes from reviewer to reviewer and friend to friend. It's the story that your good, bookworm friends will text you about and insist you need to read it next. It's the story that once you do read, you understand immediately why your friends encouraged you to read it and so in turn, you pass it along to someone who hasn't read it, yet. Eleanor and Park is just such a story.<br /><br />First, I remember 1986 a little too well, and I remember the music a little too well. I also remember the biases of small towns towards anyone who didn't fit the norm. I use this phrase entirely too much, so here it goes again -- lovely, layered characters. That's exactly what Rainbow brings us. It's not just Eleanor and Park who I feel I know so well that when I climb onto a school bus (for my kids' field trips), I expect to see them in the back. It's also the parents, especially Park's, that rang so true. His mom could be my mom if you swap out her Korean upbringing for a Serbian one. Rainbow delivers glimpses of their back-stories in a few short sentences that left me shattered at what the mom, in particular, must have experienced. I won't even discuss Park's dad, because in Rainbow's capable hands he's THAT guy; oh trust me, you'll know it when you read it. He's the guy that is so consistent; I simply fell in love with both his parents. And in them, I saw hope for what Eleanor and Park could become.<br /><br />But wait, you say, Sophie this book is not called Park's parents. Okay, it's not. I'm trying to not spoil things because Eleanor lives a tough life. An awful life. In the midst of what should be hopeless despair, she finds pockets of sanity for herself, and she finds Park. Watching her allow Park into her life made this story, for me, one of the most satisfying reads this year. I won't even talk about the ending because it contained words that broke my heart, yes, in a good way.most satisfying reads this year.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|Wow!  This book was amazing!  It was a real page turner!  I felt like I was in a real James Bond movie!  I loved the historical detail in the book.  If you love James Bond this is a must read!  I can't wait to read the next one in the series!  I would love to watch it on the big screen if they make it into a movie!  Highly recommended!  Enjoy!
0767817478|5.0|I love this movie.  There is a lot of fast action and great effects. We will watch it over and over.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I have already purchased this item before, with one of my friends half and half. We decided it be best if we both have one so we don't have to swap constantly. This product is well worth it's price. It has better sound quality than my lexicon ionix. Focusrite was not joking about the award winning preamps. All of this for such a cheap price. The only downfall is it does not have a midi input/output. All the same it is a awesome buy. Running through Cubase Artist 7, for some heavy metal, the two combined is an outrageous coop. Ready to record anything though, from metal, to jazz, to classic rock, and neo classical. I recommend the Blue Bluebird for the quality with this, and as for dynamics SM-57 Audio Technica dynamics. I also think that the plugin suite is a nice feature. I you are looking for a awesome cheap interface this is your best bet!!
B001CB8NQE|5.0|They could have gone years with this. All in all great show. Love the characters and plots. One thing wrong was the actors being dropped through the whole series. But still enjoyable.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Really fabulous guide. In a sea of contradicting and ever changing advice, Pamela brings some common sense, tried and true, practical and for me, relieving information to us with this gem of a read.<br /><br />What's especially fantastic is how she doesn't judge; instead she observes, analyzes, and either accepts what fits her needs and beliefs or rejects it and moves on. If only the all parenting information products and discussions, so full of advice mongering trolls, would be so diplomatic!<br /><br />Pamela, thanks for focusing on the good, the helpful, and the do-able ways of making parenting more pleasurable for everyone. You're book is full of its own beautiful je ne sais quoi.

B008AUGEFC|4.0|David Mitchell's 2004 Cloud Atlas is a novel in six stories: the journal of American traveler in the Pacific in 1850, the letters of a young Englishman working for a elderly composer in Belgium in 1931, a mystery story about an female investigative reporter in California in 1975, a film treatment about an aging English publisher in the present day, a Q and A with a cloned servant in dystopian Korean in 2144, and the experiences of a goatherd in post-apocalypse Hawaii in 2321. I found the book to be both less and more than I'd expected after hearing about it when the film version came out last year.<br /><br />Many readers alluded to the difficulty of the puzzling narrative structure, which I found to be far less of a problem than described. Mitchell's structure is actually pretty straightforward -- the stories unfold in chronological order but each is interrupted at a cliffhanger moment, with only the Hawaii portion told from beginning to end at roughly the midpoint in the novel. Then the other stories resume and are completed in reverse-chronological order, ending where the novel began with the Pacific journal. Although readers might lose track of elements of the interrupted stories, the narrative is easy to follow. Another element highlighted by many readers that underwhelmed me was the theme of reincarnation, especially the motif of an unusual birthmark that traced the movement of a single soul through time. The birthmark seemed gimmicky to me, especially since Mitchell didn't develop the idea beyond noting the presence of the birthmark on various characters.<br /><br />More important were the ways in which the book offered more than I'd expected. In each of these very different stories, Mitchell evoked a vivid sense of place, wove a variety of conflicts into an engaging story, and created a memorable voice. I was interested in each story individually and intrigued by they way those stories combined into the larger novel. He is clearly a very talented writer who rose to the difficult challenge he'd posed for himself in creating this complex novel. In addition, I was intrigued by the his deft use of archetypes in these tales: the captive redeemed, the sinner on the run, the corruption of power, the endurance of compassion. Several of those archetypical motifs -- and more -- could be found in each of his stories, and one of the pleasures of this novel for me was discerning the recurrence of those arcehtypes as I was reading and since I finished the novel.<br /><br />Finally, reading this book clarified for me something that I'd been mulling over for the past few months: Why do I read five or six books by novelists from Ireland or the UK for each novel I read by an American writer? American fiction is as polarized as American politics, with commercial fiction dominated by writers hoping to create a brand by devising a signature formula from a set of rigid expectations for each genre that they can repeat again and again, and literary fiction dominated by writers who pride themselves on creating unengaging characters to whom nothing much happens. Things seem to be very different across the pond where commercial writers, such as Ireland's Tana French and England's Nick Hornby, may work in identifiable genres but do not write endless iterations of the same formula. And many of the literary writers from across the sea, such as Ireland's Colm Toibin and England's Ian McEwan, deliver novels that can be enjoyed by those who read for entertainment and those who read for erudition. In Cloud Atlas, David Mitchell has married both strands of fiction -- genre and literary -- in a single novel that is both entertaining and erudite.rose to the difficult challenge he'd posed for himself in creating this complex novel.

630542845X|3.0|I already knew of this show and was so excited to own a copy of my own.  When I watched it,<br />I also wanted to see the words of what everyone speaks so I don't miss out on something.<br />I remember from a long time ago when I saw the movie that it has some very profound messages<br />in it and that's why I had so wanted my own copy.  I have never had any trouble with the words<br />showing up on any movie I have bought before this so it was quite a surprise on this DVD--it just<br />kept flipping the words off right after it showed up so you couldn't even read them.  Once in a while<br />the words would stay so you  could read them, but most of the time the words would try to come on<br />and then flip off extremely quickly.<br />Just wish I could have a copy of this wonderful movie without it being defective.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Diane
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Part of my enjoyment watching this film was watching with/listening to my wife rave about this film. It didn't hurt that Colin Firth aka Mr Darcy is one of the leads as well as Emma Thompson who played Elinor in Sense and Sensibilty as wedll as Alan Rickman who also starred in S&S (see a pattern here?).<br /><br />But the actor who steals this film is Bill Nighy, hilarious in his role as an aging celeb. And I haven't even mentioned several other All Stars who make up the cast. A good Holiday film, with bittersweet moments.
B00821OW8K|4.0|The first season of the post apocalyptic alien invasion adventure Falling Skies (2011), is generally entertaining, and has some exciting moments, but those looking for something more than a PG-13 adventure, are in for a bit of a disappointment.  Falling Skies doesn't feature graphic violence or brutality like FOX's 24.  Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, and broadcast on TNT, this series prominently features minors, and tends to soften the violence, minimize casualties, and tailor the material to be suitable for teens.<br /><br />Much must be taken on faith, beginning with a mysterious invasion by powerful robotic aliens, nicknamed \\"skidders\\".  These creatures capture children, take over their bodies, and use them to carry out their aims.  Using kids this way, just doesn't seem like the most efficient thing to do, but keeping blinders on your critical eye, often seems necessary, as the societal construct, and the way most characters behave, often seems open to question.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of survivors located near Boston, called the 2nd Massachusetts, a combination of 200 military personnel (\\"fighters\\"), and 100 civilians, led by Captain Weaver (Will Patton), who initially seems to resent the civilians.  Tom Mason (Noah Wyle), a former college professor, is second in command, and tasked with overseeing the welfare of the civilians.<br /><br />Focused on securing the basecamp, Weaver and his command, spend the first part of the season doing little fighting.  Instead it is Mason, whose son has been captured by the aliens, and an assortment of soldiers, civilians, and children, who mostly engage the enemy, usually as part of an effort to gather supplies, or rescue lost children.<br /><br />Cable TV has come a long way, but Falling Skies doesn't feature the same level of violence as The Walking Dead.  The numerous fights against CGI aliens, features tons of automatic fire, but with lots of flash and few casualties, the action scenes soon become mostly eye candy.  Interestingly,  most fatalities occur when humans kill each other.<br /><br />Discipline is generally very lax, as following orders often seems \\"optional\\".

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Clear and to the point, will go on and read &#34; good calories bad calories&#34; now. Thank you for writing such a clear and understandable book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Don't hesitate, buy it NOW!  You MUST read this hilarious, awesome, funny, brilliant, sexy, wonderful book.  I could go on and on.  I was hooked in the first 5 pages.  I love a book that can make me literally laugh out loud and this one does that on multiple occasions.  Drew and Kate have some serious chemistry and that makes the reading all that more fun.  Constantly being inside Drew's head and reading the story from his POV makes this book great.  The story was flawless.  I seriously couldn't find one thing about this wonderful story that I didn't like.  Well except that there wasn't an Epilogue, but Emma Chase fixed that by posting a few extras on her blog.  You should check them out(emmachase.net). I'm so looking forward to reading more of her stuff.  And Emma Chase if you read this and need someone to read the next one before it's released, I'm begging you to please pick me!  What are you waiting for?  BUY IT NOW, READ IT, LOVE IT and then READ IT AGAIN!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I've spent the last month or so enthralled by this book it has twists, turns, and breathtaking moments everywhere, and I honestly wish I could forget everything about it just to read it again.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is good except for the fact that you need to spend money on the good stuff and they want you to have friends that play the game to finish quests or spend real money to do it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful and attention holding perspective.  It is still hard for me to believe that Enzo did not actually write this book.  I loved the book.  Even though the story is very sad in its overall story lines, the humor is gentle but so so funny.  This is truly a must read for everyone regardless of your regular reading preferences.  I have never read anything like this book nor read one that is so real and thought-provoking.  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I too am a fan of Mist and this puzzle ranked at the top as well.  Best money spent in awhile!  I wil be looking for more just like this.  Super interesting and kept my mind busy. Highly recommend!!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Have not used it much as I just got it, but in exploring it I think it will be very helpful as a resource in understanding the scripture. Seems easy to use and move around in.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderfully written, haunting tale.  The book mesmerized me -- couldn't put it down.  Brought back memories of my Catholic grade school.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although I missed the smell of a paper book I truly enjoyed the read for this entire series of the Hunger Games!!!
030746363X|2.0|First off let me say that I am a fan of the 4 Hour Workweek and give Tim Ferris a lot of credit for all the unique and helpful ideas he presented in that book. Unfortunately I cannot say that same about the 4-Hour Body and here is why...<br />1) Most of the info in this book is not unique - as a fan of workout/bodybuilding/diet books I have read most if not all of the legit info in here before. I was really hoping that Mr Ferris could provide some thought-provoking, NEW info that would make a real difference for my workouts/lifestyle diet but that was not the case. It's mostly a rehashing of a variety of tidbits from other sources but just presented in the Ferris style.<br />2) The title and the advertising/promo for this book are misleading. Especially as regards the diet recommendations in this book -- once again the ideas are NOT new and more importantly the diets ideas definitely not realistic as a long-term lifestyle change for the majority of americans. I have no doubt that you can lose a lot of weight if you follow the diet he recommends, but I also have no doubt that &#60;1% of americans can stick with such a diet/lifestyle for more than a few weeks, if that. There are many other lifestyle diets that are not so restrictive that can achieve as good results which are more realistic to follow.<br />3) By his own words, Mr Ferris prompts you to be skeptical of health claims made which are supported by little/sketchy science/data and yet he repeatedly writes about experiments which he conducted on either himself or just a few people - such a small sample size does not yield acceptable scientific data that can lead to a reliable conclusion. His conclusions could just as well be due to random chance vs his theory.<br />4) The information about bodybuilding and muscle gain is some of the most sketchy of all. I would love to see even a single person who has achieved legit muscle gain using only the techniques described in this book. I cry 'foul' on his muscle gain claims.<br />5) Notice all the 5-star reviews? Did you also notice that many of them were written by people who only reviewed this book and/or that they were submitted really early on when this book was first published? Given that Mr Ferris is a marketing genius, one has to wonder how many of those 5-stars are from real people vs his outsource team. I give him credit for achieving his goal of getting another book on the best-seller list and raking in a lot of cash, but I'm disappointed in the lack of substance/value he has provided to his fans.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE - If you enjoy his rather flippant writing style from his other books, and you are only looking an interesting page turner you may well like this book, BUT if you are looking for a book that will really help you make a lifestyle change, I'm sorry to say this book is not it. If you buy it looking for ways to really change your body, you will be disappointed.aims.<br />5) Notice all the 5-star reviews?

B007G92QGO|5.0|defending your children can often be precarious and knowing your child's behavour can sometimes make you wonder if you are right or wrong to defend so strongly. Jacob's Dad was a super hero in defence of his son. a great and interesting read.
B003ODL3ME|4.0|Brand new still wrapped up and in great condition. Item will be handed down for generations to come.Thank you very much.I was not aware that it was a reissue,maybe make that clear in the description.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Thank you Charlaine. But, after 13 great Sookie books, it was time to end this saga. It was an outstanding series and if I miss all the craziness of Bon Temps and its zany inhabitants I can always reread the books. Again thank you
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is very additive for the first month. It's great but will cut you off from any other life you have. It's a lot better than Temple Run 1 and has great color with fun new obstacles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love, love LOVE this game.So, horse lovers get ready! Train your horse, feed it, dress it,groom it, and visit friends. Me and my sister play it every second we get. So listen, GET THIS GAME RIGHT EXACTLY NOW OR YOU WILL DIE!!!!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|What a terrific tribute to an outstanding human being. The music is awesome. The comedy is side splitting. George's son looks so much like him it's heartbreaking. Don't hesitate.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Love my new utensil set by Joseph Joseph!  Bright colors are what drew me to this set.  I was happily surprised that they are not a light weight cheap plastic.  I picked them up for the first time and was shocked at how heavy they felt.  These will last a long time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is so awesome! I don't know how I didn't get it earlier! there is so many dragons to breed to make more. the ones you make are even cooler! I love Dragon Story! I love it I love it I do!
B0033TI4BW|5.0|It's been a long time since the release of Motivation 2.0 (aka. Carrots and Sticks), and it served us well for centuries.<br />But in recent decades, it has many bugs & unexpected outcomes than ever.<br />Although we have upgrade them with numerous of patches: empowerment, personal development, leadership, it becomes more and more unstable.<br />It's time to updagre to Motivation 3.0 with three major component: Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Highly applicable principles.<br />- Useful toolkits.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- I'll update to you when I found them.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|it was a good movie, that was well done, great cast, worth the watch.  Who can go wrong with Denzel Washington.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent entertainment & a window into the times.  Nice to watch a movie where every other other sentence doesn't contain a curse Gword.  Recommend for any with an interest in British fictional and historical movies.  Go Maggie Smith!!!
6304602944|5.0|This movie was so stupid it was good.  Watch it for great one liners and action, if you're looking for a life changing experience, this isn't it, it's just a fun movie.
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|&#34;Revolutionary&#34; is hyperbolic in this case, but I did find the information and proposed solutions to be understandable, believable, and practical.  I would rate this book as being as influential ( to me at least) as Covey's 7 Habits.
B002AT4KA0|5.0|You'd think as the series went on they'd get worse on worse, but actually they keep up pretty well.  I mean it's basically about fast cars and cool stunts, and if you're going to continue to watch them all this I the fourth so you really do need to see them all in order
B002V091IO|4.0|easy to read and kept my interest from start to finish. made me want to read more by David Nicholls
B00003CXB6|5.0|Jurassic Park I think has been seen by everybody so I don't think you need a review it's a great movie
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I have heard many newer songs and now am waiting for the second album. They are different and I like that the most.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This is just a fun movie with a lot of great action and stunts, it was a little summer film that was supposed to make a little money and that was it and now we are in the summer of the sixth installment of the franchise, so it is the little engine that could
0345803493|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was better than the first.  You learn more about Christian's childhood.  Looking forward to reading the 3rd book.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|Great action movie, a little bit more of a thinking mans action then just blow everything up and a great supporting cast
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Although this story starts out slowly, it picks up speed quickly and leaves you breathless!  So many twists and turns!
B000HA4WT8|5.0|Not as great as the others but it's an on going series so get it as it's the third film and have a good time, that's what these movies are made for, they are not some comment on society
B0076DELIG|3.0|but pretty typical for this type of Novel, but prehaps I read too much in this genre...so overall it was good read
B0053FANT0|5.0|Not Shakespear people, doesn't even really have a strong plot, but there are fast cars and great stunts, so worth watching especially since the series seems to never end, you may want to keep up
0810983915|5.0|I was very impressed with the shipping of this book.  I ordered it one day and it was delivered the next. My son loves this series and actually finished the book the day after we received it.<br /><br />Amazon is a wonderful way to shop!
B0006OBPTA|5.0|&#34;Wax on Wax off,&#34; come on it's the Karate Kid it's a great series and the fourth one wasn't that bad either, Hilary Swank before the Oscars, and bonus interviews and featurette with the cast was so much fun to see
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This is a fine app and I felt compelled to leave a 5 star review just to cancel out some of the unjust one star reviews. Of COURSE this app requires a camera and I'm terribly sorry the Kindle doesn't come with one (neither does my tablet) but on my phone this type of app is very useful. I understand there are plenty of Kindle users on the Amazon App Store but I have a Nook Tablet and a Galaxy S3 on the Amazon App Store, so other devices are out there. Don't take it out on this app! If you're at all dissuaded from purchasing this app due to the one star reviews go and read them and you will find that they are all unfairly written.
0316228532|5.0|It's no Harry Potter, but JK Rowling is a gifted writer and if you enjoyed her work on the Potter series, it's not a bad read
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent story and a quick read.  Religious beginning leading into exciting survivalist story on the ocean.  For all ages and types of people.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I think everyone's seen Jurassic Park so a review isn't really necessary but there's a lot of scary dinosaurs that chase people, lots of fun.  I do feel bad for the dinosaurs, people made them and then when they didn't suit their purpose killed them.  Michael Creighton knew how to right a fun story that really had a great message behind it
B00A757EFW|3.0|Don't get too attached to playing this game.  Its for demonstration purposes only.  At the end of the second board, it stops the game you are in and sends you a prompt to download the paid version.  It would have been nice if they explained that a little clearer before I downloaded the game.
B00005N5S5|5.0|scared me to death but I do think that James Cameron has a way of showing possibilities for the future that could happen, machines could take over the world
B0015DROBO|3.0|Not what I was expecting, a bit slow at first but necessary so that the back home of the thrill could be understood
B00004TRD8|5.0|great movie that didn't scare me as much as the first, I preferred Arnold as the good guy, I do think they should have stopped after this one though the others got a little lame
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wanting a book on the trials of a marriage this one hit the spot with the test of determination an succeeding.  This book brings excitement and troubles all in one.
B00000IQW5|5.0|this is an older movie and sometimes forgotten, but it was a sad movie, like Ghost, but unlike Ghost this one tried to inject a lot of humor to it and they succeed, it's a little like Field of Dreams in an emotional way
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this one immensely. I've played it twice now and enjoyed as much as the first time. Lots of puzzles to solve and people to save.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|I think most people have seen Jurassic Park by now, but if not it's a fun movie about dinosaurs that try to eat people.  I hope the dinosaurs win
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play solitaire! It's fun and easy game. Very relaxing for me. I like to play it before bed.
B00015YVD6|5.0|The movie itself is a classic and the bonus features were so much fun, especially hearing the commentary by Ron Howard, who knew Richie Cunningham/Opie Taylor would turn out to be such a great director
B0053D9GUO|5.0|We caught this film incidentally last year. I have been looking to buy it ever since on BluRay. I was trying to get it directly from Finland, but was not having much luck. I was very happy to find a copy offered here in the US.<br />This version doesn't have all of the languages of the Finnish version... Swedish, Norwegian, Dannish. That is kind of a bummer for me since my wife speaks Swedish and my kids and I are learning Swedish. It would have been nice to have another movie to listen to in Swedish. Perhaps I can download just the swedish sound-track and make another version for playing on our Apple TV.<br /><br />Anyhow, the movie is very charming although tinged with sadness. I think it has a lot more grist of life than the typical holiday movie, but I like that. The kids were fascinated and the film started lots of conversations for days.
6304806434|5.0|this movie is so much fun to watch, typical Bruckheimer action, he's a great producer.  The bad guys are so aweful that you want them to die but you also want them to be around for a while because they are so funny
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent historical novel.  A page turner for sure.  Can't wait to start the second of the trilogy.  Highly recommend for a good history lesson of WWI.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|lots of fun I watched the other four had to see the fifth one and if you're going to watch the sixth probably should see this one first
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Took a while to start but couldn't put the book down after that. Great story with lots of action. Awesome
6304711891|5.0|actually a rather intelligent movie for a Bruckheimer, it had great action, great one liners and great acting, probably highly improbable situation but who cares it was fun to watch
B00992CF6W|5.0|all I have to say is wow the game I don't why it does not have five stars I mean I'm right it should so give it five stars
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|I was kind of in one of those &#34;movie debates&#34;... what should I watch? I saw this title and thought. This night is about to get fun!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is just so cool! but if you don't have any money its ok but still its a good game
140053271X|5.0|the reason ill take a eInk reader over a kindle eInk reader,  is because the nook has expandable memory (up to 32GB). when you get to the fire and nook color/tab its a different story. the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing. if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect. feels great in the hand, the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy. although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.<br /><br />the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another. i believe its because of the eInk style.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I like the idea...but as it turns out, my device doesn't have a camera. still, ill have it in my cloud untill I can use it.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|My son is WAY into diggers... any truck for that matter, and this truck was excellent. Sturdy construction and durability, educationally \\"accurate\\" design, and fun for my little guy (he's 22 months but I monitor his play - it's been fine).
B00A7W29BE|5.0|The apps description clearly states this is for Android PHONES. The people leaving a bad review because they don't have have a rear facing camera should REMOVE their review or update the stars. The app works for those tablets and phones with a REAR facing camera. Now, if you Kindle Fire folks plan to buy a tablet or Android phone with a rear facing camera, then by all means \\"purchase\\" the app and place in your coffers for later. The developer is NOT to blame for this app. The description from the developer clearly states for PHONES several times. When developers have their app and an \\"app of the day\\" they choose to get their names and products out there. When reviewers leave negative reviews, this forces developers to not write apps for Amazon. Also, \\"App of the Day\\" isn't just for Amazon. It is a cross platform for ALL Android based devices.<br /><br />Another thing, For folks who complain about the apps or ads in apps, get over yourself. It's free. These developers have to pay the bills somehow.<br /><br />About the app: The app works as advertised. This is great for receipts, expense reports, or anything that you should keep a digital copy of. There are many cloud based storage services out there. Sign up for several if need be. Box, Dropbox, Mediafire,Google Drive, Microsoft Skydrive, Flickr & Copy all come to mind. If Amazon doesn't offer these apps, simply Google \\"Play Store apk for Kindle Fire\\" and download and install.
1476733953|5.0|There is no other word I can use to describe \\"Wool\\". I came down with a bad case of the flu and having nothing to do but recuperate I decided to give this book a chance. It was there in the front page of Amazon and I figured hey, why not? I didn't read the plot summary, didn't even really know what genre it was, but I trusted that it wouldn't be featured so prominently if it was bad.<br /><br />I was so wrong...<br /><br />Wool was not bad, Wool was not good. Wool was absolutely AMAZING!!! For the two days it took me to read it I was completely transfixed by and obsessed with the people of this massive silo in the middle of a barren, toxic wasteland. There was no end to the revelations and plot twists and I found it hard to sleep without thinking first of what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I would, and have, recommended this book to anyone who has even a passing interest in books.<br />5 stars well-deserved!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Fast and accurate. Up to date information of my choice of locations. I check it daily as I have limited availability to my local area weather on the news. I find it very helpful in providing alerts and warnings of bad weather information.
1452110581|5.0|I gave it to a friend for her birthday and she just about died. We joke that we'll both be forever alone with hundreds of cats, her the cat lady and me the cat guy, so this fit perfectly into our weird relationship.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I thought the author did a fantastic job writing this story from the man's perspective.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  She was spot on to what was going on in his mind, and the way the character was so open and honest, I honestly thought a man had written the book!!!  What a refreshing twist in a romance novel, and to see the struggles from a man's point of view.  There should honestly be more books like this one.<br /><br />Great job by the author and an absolute MUST READ!!!!
B00942X8PY|3.0|Nothing special. Kept my attention for about three days until I got bored of it. Wish it could have done more for me. It's worth a try, though.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I really like this science concept and the diet as a long term solution.  I am in my early 40s and starting to get nervous about the diseases that I may face in the next few decades and would love for this to be the solution.  I'm not going to lie - the fast days are hard, but knowing you can eat what you want the next day without worrying about it keeps you motivated,  Also I LOVE the way I feel the day after the fast.  Lighter, more energetic, and healthier.  As for weight loss, I wanted to lose 5-7 lbs that I gained over the winter months and started this in early April.  I tried the eating without care on the off days, but found after 3 weeks I was just maintaining my current weight, which was good considering what I was eating on the off days.  After a few weeks I switched to eating what I wanted on off days but chose healthier options.  This started to work but very slow, maybe a pound a week.  I think if you eat healthier options on the off days weight loss is slow but sure, and once you get to your goal this is a good long term maintenance plan that allows you to eat whatever you want on off days, and hopefully has some amazing health benefits.
B00846WWVM|1.0|I found it boring and, well, mediocre. I accidentally purchased it when it was one of the free apps, tried it once, then never looked back.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The entire time I was reading this book, I kept waiting for it to get interesting. Instead the story was a complete bore. I was a huge fan of the series and was let down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazon keeps bugging me to rate this book, and I loved reading it, so I guess it deserves to get a few words in return.<br />To make a not too long story short: It's Fallout meets The Road. It's a compilation of short stories, with the first and most self-contained being incredibly bleak (and the one most deserving of the aforementioned elevator pitch). It also sets up the society - and the mystery at the heart of it - explored in the the following four stories. They are more conventionally dramatic than part one, but they retain the oppressive atmosphere, while infusing it with a degree of hope and agency that keeps the story from plunging into to a pit of despair.<br />Highly recommended!
B009J2VMXY|5.0|[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]<br /><br />The Universal Box contains 38 recordings of the Rite of Spring on 19 CDs.<br />The rival Sony Box has 10 performances on 10 CDs: [[ASIN:B00AYQHPDK Igor Stravinsky: Le Sacre Du Printemps 100th Anniv]]<br />EMI has yet to be heard from.<br />This is getting out of hand.<br /><br />All this set me to thinking: What are the truly essential recordings of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring?<br />Not the BEST PERFORMANCE or the BEST RECORDING, but the MOST IMPORTANT recordings of the music since its debut in 1913.<br />Recordings every serious Stravinskian should own.<br /><br />I came up with a list of thirteen recordings.<br />- Stravinsky was notoriously superstitious; I don't think he would like this.<br /><br />The earliest was recorded in 1921, the most recent in 1969.<br />Sony includes five of them in their box (50%).<br />Universal includes just three, out of of the 38 in their box (Ouch).<br /><br />Three are conducted by the composer.<br />Three are conducted by Pierre Monteux, the conductor at the first performance in 1913.<br />[Monteux began his conducting career in 1895 and was active well into the 1960s].<br /><br />1) 1921 - Igor Stravinsky played The Rite on a pianola which created a piano roll: [[ASIN:B001RILB20 Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring]] - or - [[ASIN:B000000TPX Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring]]<br />Later on he was able to speed up certain sections, or add additional notes by punching new holes in the piano roll.<br />Apparently he did this a lot. He was not a virtuoso pianist.<br />The exact tempo is always controversial with piano rolls, but they do preserve the tempo relationships the composer wanted (seven years after the premiere).<br /><br />2) 1929 - Pierre Monteux, Orchestre Symphonique de Paris: [[ASIN:B000027QGN Stravinsky: Rite of Spring and Petrushka]] - or - [[ASIN:B00000G2IR Orchestre Symphonique de Paris, Vol. 2.]]<br />3) 1929 - Igor Stravinsky, Walther Straram Concerts Orchestra: [[ASIN:B00008FITD Rite of Spring / Firebird]]<br />Sixteen years after the premiere, EMI recorded competing versions by the composer, and by the conductor of that first performance.<br />These two are as close as we can get to what the first night audience heard (minus the yelling).<br />Both are in primitive sound with barely competent French orchestras.<br />The orchestra at the first performance wasn't that great either.<br />The Monteux is a mess, the Stravinsky even messier. Both are essential.<br />I wish EMI or Naxos would couple them on a single CD with informed program notes.<br /><br />4) 1930 - Leopold Stokowski, Philadelphia Orchestra - in the Sony Box or ASIN: B00000E6PA *<br />Stokowski conducted the American premiere of the work in 1920.<br />His was the best-selling Rite on 78s.<br />The Rite of Spring became a fixture in popular culture after Stokowski conducted it in Walt Disney's &#34;Fantasia&#34;.<br />You can also hear Part Two as suspense music (uncredited) in lots of low-budget Hollywood films from the '30s through the '50s).<br /><br />5) 1940 - Igor Stravinsky, New York Philharmonic - in the Sony Box or ASIN: B00AL6SN52 *<br />The composer's second go at the work, with a much better orchestra than 1929 (plus his conducting skills had improved).<br /><br />6) 1951 - Pierre Monteux, Boston Symphony - in the Sony Box or ASIN: B000003FLV or ASIN: B00000E6C7 *<br />Monteux's second recording, with one of the great orchestras. Mono sound is the only drawback.<br /><br />7) 1956 - Pierre Monteux, Paris Conservatoire Orchestra - in the Universal Box or ASIN: B000G6BJKS *<br />Monteux's third recording, the first stereo recording of the work.<br />The orchestra is less good than the Boston Symphony, but it does have the quintessential French orchestral sound (now lost).<br /><br />8) 1957 - Ernest Ansermet, L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande - in the Universal Box or ASIN: B00005ND3M or ASIN:B000004242 *<br />On Stravinsky's recommendation, Ansermet was appointed Monteux's successor as music director of the Ballets Russe.<br />He conducted the first revival of the Rite of Spring in 1916, and was close to the composer for the next twenty years.<br /><br />9) 1958 - Leonard Bernstein, New York Philharmonic: [[ASIN:B00BQSSGD8 Stravinsky: Le Sacre Du Printemps]]<br />This was the best-selling Rite of Spring in the early stereo era.<br />People bought it to show off their new Hi-Fi Stereo equipment.<br />It popularized the work on LP much like Stokowski had done on 78s.<br />For some reason, Sony left it out of their box, opting instead for Bernstein's less interesting 1972 remake with the London Symphony<br />(Universal has his even less interesting 1982 remake with the Israel Philharmonic).<br /><br />10) 1960 - Igor Stravinsky, Columbia Symphony - in the Sony Box or ASIN: B00AL6SN52 *<br />The composer's third attempt, the only one in stereo. His conducting skills kept getting better.<br />This was the New York version of the &#34;Columbia Symphony&#34; - basically the New York Philharmonic.<br /><br />11) 1964 - Herbert von Karajan, Berlin Philharmonic - in the Universal Box or ASIN: B000W99IJI *<br />Included in this list as an example of what not to do.<br />Stravinsky famously trashed this recording in Hi-Fi Stereo Review (February, 1965):<br />&#34;..the performance [is] too polished, a pet savage rather than a real one...I doubt whether The Rite can be satisfactory performed in terms of Herr von Karajan's traditions. I do not mean to imply that he is out of his depths, however, but rather that he is in my shallows...There are simply no regions for soul-searching in The Rite of Spring.&#34;<br />[Perhaps chastened by this review, Karajan's 1977 remake is both more conventional and less interesting]<br /><br />12) 1966 - Yevgeny Svetlanov, USSR Symphony: Stravinsky: [[ASIN:B000H49NFM Stravinsky: Rite of Spring / Petrushka]] - or - [[ASIN:B00176OA2K Igor Stravinsky- The rite of spring, Card game]] - or - [[ASIN:B0000E6XK3 Stravinsky-Rite of Spring/Jeu de Cartes]]<br />My wild card choice.<br />In the same article where he trashed Karajan, Stravinsky had high praise for a 1962 concert by this same USSR Symphony, conducted by Robert Craft:<br />&#34;...whereas the French orchestra turned the Rite into a French piece, and the German orchestra into a German piece, the Russian turns into a Russian piece which is just right...compare this to America where it has become a conductor's showpiece for one-rehearsal concerts in the Hollywood Bowl!&#34;<br />Stravinsky wasn't praising Craft's conducting.<br />He was praising the Russian sound of the orchestra, which is exactly what he wanted.<br />Since the fall of Communism, Russian orchestras have lost this unique sound.<br />This is not the case with the oldest Russian recording I could find: Svetlanov's 1966 USSR Symphony has a sound that is lost to history, but it is precisely this sound that Stravinsky had in mind when composing the Rite of Spring.<br /><br />13) 1969 - Pierre Boulez, Cleveland Orchestra - in the Sony Box or ASIN: B000002A2M *<br />In a sense, this was the first modern recording of The Rite of Spring.<br />It created a sensation when first released;<br />No one had ever heard an orchestra play this music with such precision.<br />Something that later recordings take for granted.<br />As to the performance itself, in 1970 Stravinsky gave it a qualified recommendation (he preferred his own - No surprise.)<br />Boulez's 1992 Cleveland remake - in the Universal Box - is just one of the many note-perfect recordings that came later.<br /><br />If you're counting: Numbers 1, 2, 3, 9, 12 are not part of any box ;

Stravinsky wasn't praising Craft's conducting. He was praising the Russian sound of the orchestra, which is exactly what he wanted. Since the fall of Communism, Russian orchestras have lost this unique sound. This is not the case with the oldest Russian recording I could find: Svetlanov's 1966 USSR Symphony has a sound that is lost to history, but it is precisely this sound that Stravinsky had in mind when composing the Rite of Spring.  13) 1969 - Pierre Boulez, Cleveland Orchestra - in the Sony Box or ASIN: B000002A2M * In a sense, this was the first modern recording of The Rite of Spring. It created a sensation when first released; No one had ever heard an orchestra play this music with such precision. Something that later recordings take for granted. As to the performance itself, in 1970 Stravinsky gave it a qualified recommendation (he preferred his own - No surprise.) Boulez's 1992 Cleveland remake - in the Universal Box - is just one of the many note-perfect recordings that came later.  If you're counting: Numbers 1, 2, 3, 9, 12 are not part of any box ; Numbers 4, 5, 6, 10, 13 are in the Sony box ; Numbers 7, 8, 11 are in the Universal box.  * All the performances in the Sony and Universal boxes are available separately.

B00BV2M9LO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel! After witnessing evidence to a violent crime, a group of graduate students are shrunk down and thrown out into the Hawaiian jungle to die. Think about it: it's so much easier to dispose of tiny bodies!<br />The micro world is like an alien world. Like Jurassic Park, we don't know very much about these creatures. And after finding themselves suddenly thrust into the same world as them, they are both fascinated and terrified. After spending their lives studying creatures from the other end of a microscope, they are now experiencing first-hand sights, sounds and even tastes that human were never meant to be experience.<br />In this book, ants become the new velociraptor. Something as mundane as a wasp's nest now rivals the lair of Leatherface. And chipper birdsong might as well be the terrifying soundtrack to 'Jaws'.<br />There is more to this book though than monsters. The primary villain is one you will love to hate. The creepy murder mystery at play is enjoyable, even though we know who did it! (The 'how' is the fun part) The ridiculous shrinking technology is interesting, and there's even a love story to boot!<br />If you want a blockbuster-type monster story complete with descriptive words like 'viscera', and 'food ball', then you will love this book! If you're in the mood to visit another world for 400 pages, then pick up 'Micro'.<br /><br />A tip: Keep 'Google Images' handy to see the creatures you will never look at the same way again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hey guys!!! This game is really fun and addicting. U should get it. Don't go fast though because u will track trust me. I am glad that they made this game for free because when I wanted to get it it was 99&cent; so I couldn't get it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I like having the extra cord so I can keep one at home and one travels with the Kindle. I never have a problem charging when I travel for business or have to worry if I remember to pack it, I have a little pouch that I have attached to the case.
0762449306|5.0|I love this collectable, very well made and the timeline card is great!  I'm so glad I got it and any Whovian would love to add this to their collection!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I plan to teach this book to my Unity congregation. it's full of good teaching exercises to practice. The concepts though not simple are written in a way as to be easily understood.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love true stories.  The Blind Side has a practical meaning for football and a social meaning for life.  It made me laught and cry and had good heroes and good villians.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Helps time go by and is fun to play.  Great that the game gets harder each wave. Wish you didn't have to buy some characters they all should be unlocked as the game is played out.
B006YC74E8|1.0|This app is horrible. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. You can't do anything with this app and I deleted it the day after i downloaded it.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Order it, pay for it, and get it before the weekend to make the grandsons happy when we babysit!  We just love it when a plan comes together!  There were no problems with any facet of the purchase and we would definitely buy from them again.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't get the hype around this book.  I was so excited to read it because I heard how amazing it was and how the twists would blow my mind. Negative.  The book was very well written and I still got to escape into another story, but I could see where every turn was going.  I kept waiting for the shocking, jaw dropping, plot twist that everyone promised, and it never came.  Maybe I was just too good at guessing the plot, but this book fell flat for me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is very fun. It is hard to get a high score though. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Great book, I've enjoyed the entire Mitch Rapp series and this one doesn't disappoint.  Doobie doobie doo ba dada ba

B00A8MGLAI|2.0|The book kind of pulls it off. You read and you follow and many enjoy it. Of course, they had to make a movie out of it. They gambled and lost. The movie did not pull it off, even with good actors. Very forgettable result.
0865479410|5.0|This book talks about life as it really is and the way people need to understand it.  I have recommended the book to others.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and research with me I have been searching for a book like this and found so much value I feel like I have been taken on a journey to genius land and I love it. Could you please give us more thanks<br />Marco Ziervogel
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I can't believe I'm reviewing Batman... I'm a Mom of a comic book character enthusiast!  This was the best of the 3 done by the director..Dark but not as dark as the last one.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|This is one wild ride of a movie and what makes it even more intense is that most of the things in this movie are going to happen!The special effects are outstanding and the cast are excellent!This is truly an epic movie that everyone should see:-)
B00867GHS8|5.0|It's Nemo... We had to buy it and add it to our collection.  We LOVE this movie.  While it's still in the plastic, unwrapped... we will watch it again and again... when we are done with our Nemo break!  Can't wait for Finding Dory!

B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Love this game. Perfect for kids and adults! Time flies by and its super easy. No need to spend money either :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun and a good challenge. I enjoy the pace, and the look of it. The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that I dislike the large ads that are at the beginning of every game (I can personally only stand so much of Maria Shriver), but at least they let you skip through them without much problem.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Such a great read. Haven't been able to put it down since they day I got it. The story sucks you in and takes you on a ride. Kudos Mr. King!
B000WZAE1I|2.0|I love this movie BUT the frustration of watching the movie with the incredible sound issues makes it almost unbearable. I have to turn it up for dialogue, down for sound affects. I'm not certain it's worth the effort.  It certainly pisses me off every time I try to watch it!  What a horrible waste of a great movie!  LOVE DeNiro!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It combines fun with work. Very and entertains. Very good game. Well made fun to play. For all ages.  Awesome
B000C3H4MC|3.0|After opening the files in pro-audio software, it is NOT 24bit/96kHz, it is 24/48kHz. It is not a bootleg.<br /><br />But it's mixed well, except for some portions of the vocals. So many engineers don't pay enough attention to the vocals and in some sections the vocals are pushed too far \\"back\\", like in parts of Once In A Lifetime, so it sounds as if the Byrne was singing from a back room. It happens a lot when bands release surround mixes. I don't know why it happens so often, it's not a hard thing to get right!!<br />I am hoping the other DVD-A editions are better in that regard. But overall it's fairly well-done.<br />They need Steven Wilson to remix/remaster for them.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome, very fun and addictive and really challenging. I can't stop playing it. It is just great game
B008JFUP0I|5.0|\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" movie series has had a very interesting evolution since the first film came out in the 2001.  The first one was an entertaining, but unremarkable, action film targeted to gear-heads and racing fanatics.  The sequel, \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\", was incredibly underwhelming with a lackluster villain and Tyrese doing everything possible to make you dislike him.  Then, the producers tried a completely different route and change setting to Japan for \\"Fast and the Furious:  Tokyo Drift\\", and completely and utterly forgettable film that should have been the end of the franchise.<br /><br />  Not to be deterred by their cash cow, the studio took one last shot by bringing back all the original characters in a fourth film \\"Fast & Furious\\".  This was like an injection of adrenaline that franchise sorely needed.  Reconnecting fans with the personalities they had developed an affection for in the first film was the first crucial step.  The next critical step was creating a story line that preserved car-racing soul of the films while raising the action and intensity with much bolder capers.<br /><br />  The big success of the fourth film guaranteed that \\"Fast Five\\" would be made and it stepped the game up a notch by bringing back other notable characters from films 2, 3, and 4, while introducing The Rock to add more weight to the ensemble.  This fascinating Brazilian caper let to the \\"Fast & Furious 6\\", which, you can tell from the previews, takes the action and stunts up even another level.<br /><br />  This film has The Rock's Luke Hobbs seeking out Dominic Toretto's crew to help him nab an organization of high-end thieves who are hijacking advanced military equipment.  One member of that organization has a special history with Toretto's crew.  The cat-and-mouse nature of the heists; the exotic locales; and high-octane action sequences have turned this franchise in a hybrid like `Bourne meets Bond meets Bullit'.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I'm very much looking forward to the 7th one in the series, due to be released in 2014.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Overall, the movie was great, but I wonder about the Raid Scene when the Klan makes the raid on the Vigilante's camp.  The first scene of the raid shows the group racing toward the camp, but the next scene shows the group gathered at a meeting place, trying to get their hoods fitted correctly, in order to affect the raid on the camp.  After they decide how they were going to wear the hoods, the following scene was that of the group racing toward the camp again, but it seemed to be the first raid scene, repeated.  Why didn't the editors catch that mistake?

B005I735ZM|3.0|Two complete Furtwangler Ring Cycles, and one Decca professional recording of Die Walkure, have been around on private and pirate records since the mid-1950s. Each has many unforgettable and magnificent moments, since each is conducted by Furtwangler but with entirely different orchestras and casts.<br /><br />My point is this: throw out every vinyl, tape, cd you own of these performances. The gold standard has been met. There is now only ONE great, technically and musically remastered version of each of these performances. Save your money and buy them all. Andrew Rose, with collaboration from master audiophile restorers Ward Marsten and Mark Obert-Thorn, have created a simply unsurpassable library of great musical performances, dating from the earliest cylinders to remastered cds. As they expand their catalogue, every great Furtwangler performance will be available in formats ranging from MP3 to 24-bit Ambient Stereo.<br /><br />I promise that you will listen to \\"old performances\\" remastered with such care, clarity, musical knowledge and taste that -- were Pristine better known -- no one would buy anything else. Incidentally they have done absolutely splendid jazz remasters, Broadway and television soundtracks -- anything you could ask for.
B002CMQS1O|5.0|It's a must remember cult-classic for those of us who actually watched it first time in the theaters. Back in the day, it was an excellent spoof on the heavy metal culture... Today, it can make us reflect on our own -today's- culture's star-struck, idol-worshipping, celebrity-and singers bogus craze.  Have times changed?
B003ODIZL6|4.0|The New Oxford American Dictionary is a dictionary. A funny dictionary... and sometimes a confusing dictionary. I have mixed feelings about this dictionary. One is that why am I writing a review for a dictionary? Do you find this review confusing or just plain stupid? Do pickles and mac and cheese go well together? Am I a cucumber? But cucumbers are good. But you can't start a sentence with but. So many mistakes. Does this dictionary have mistakes? Well, I don't have the time to look through it and see. I do have an answer for one of your questions. I am writing this review because I am bored. But I am a more appropriate type of bored. Not type random letters bored, but write a completely unrelated review to a dictionary bored. So next time you're bored write a pointless review for a dictionary. Overall, I give this dictionary 4/5 stars. Why four? Well, I have no idea.
0374533571|3.0|Sports fans, English lit lovers, and exercise nuts will probably love SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. About half the book revolves around the Philadelphia Eagles or \\"The Birds\\" as their fans call them. The main character, Pat Peoples, is a former social studies teacher/coach who is rescued from \\"the bad place,\\" a sanitarium, by his mother. He has been spending most of his time there \\"pumping iron\\" trying to impress his former wife, Nikki, who he believes is just taking some time apart. But he's really been in the mental hospital for four years, and he did something felonious to get sent there. He also tries to read some of the books his wife recommended, such as The GREAT GATSBY and THE SCARLET LETTER. He finds them depressing since none seem to have a happy ending and he believes in \\"The Silver Lining\\" in the clouds.<br /><br />Pat's brother gives him a Hank Baskett football jersey as a present. Jake and his wife try to set Pat up with her sister, Tiffany, only to start what looks like a severe case of stalking. Coincidentally the sister lost her husband Tommy, a policeman, and is suffering from clinical depression. Anyway, Pat spends most of the day exercising and running, and when he sets out on a run, Tiffany is always there. She doesn't say much; she doesn't even seem to like him, but she seems to know when he's going to run and she's almost as fit as he is.<br /><br />Pat, Jake and Pat's best friend go to a lot of Eagles' games. Before one game, Pat is confronted with the Asian Invasion, about fifty East Indian football fans that include his psychiatrist, Dr. Patel. Dr. Patel is almost as nuts about the Eagles as are Pat's friends and his dad, who goes through his own depression when the Eagles lose. The acorn didn't fall too far from the tree where Pat's father is concerned. Author Matthew Quick never solves the father issue. He only talks to Pat about sports, and he treats his wife like dirt most of the time.<br /><br />Tiffany has a special project, actually a test, in mind for Pat. Quick saves resolution of the Nikki dilemma until near the end.<br /><br />I had two problems with the book. Pat doesn't seem that sick. At first he spits out some of the medication Dr. Patel prescribes, but he doesn't seem to have a problem even when he's not taking the pills, other than his delusional behavior concerning Nikki and his obsession with exercise. There's also an 800 pound gorilla in the room; it's called THE CURIOUS INCIDENT  OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT TIME by Mark Haddon. It's the best book I've ever read on mental illness and SILVER LINING PLAYBOOK just doesn't compare. Quick's book is also far too predictable. That doesn't mean I don't plan to rent the movie. DeNiro plays the father and both leads were nominated for best actor.t, in mind for Pat. Quick saves resolution of the Nikki dilemma until near the end.<br /><br />I had two problems with the book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|i was completely captivated by this story. i liked the story, liked the characters, liked it all. very well written, and well edited. i couldnt put it down
0525421580|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book. I don't even know how to review it except to say I loved it.  But I'll try and put it into words.<br /><br />First let me say that I was introduced to John Green by my Nerdfighter daughter. She kept telling me I had to read him and so I picked up The Fault in Our Stars and I fell in love. So when a few fellow reader friends started talking up this book I picked it up and I am so happy I did.<br /><br />Will Grayson is a fairly typical teenager, trying to figure life out but also trying to distance himself from people as a form of protection - don't get too close and you can't get hurt. His closest friend is Tiny Cooper, his nickname an oxymoron because he is anything but Tiny. And he is proudly, flamboyantly and over the top Gay - with a capital G. He is also the very heart and soul of this book.  Unbeknownst to Will Grayson there is another Will Grayson out there (OWG). He is also a teenager, but with serious identity and emotional problems, trying to deal with depression and thoughts of suicide. One night a very cruel joke is played on OWG and he crosses paths with Will Grayson. This meeting has consequences good and bad that reverberate through their lives over the course of the next few months as Tiny Cooper tries to stage the \\"Biggest, Gayest Musical\\" ever.<br /><br />I know it sounds a little bizarre but it's not. It is a book about growing up, growing pains, falling in love, friendship and its ups and downs. It is full of heart and full of laughs and full of pain. But it is ultimately uplifting. And all I can say is that everyone should have a Tiny Cooper in their life.<br /><br />I read and listened to this at the same time (Whispersync) and loved the audio so much I stopped reading the book. The narration was perfect and it had the added bonus of hearing the songs in Tiny's show.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I heard the movie was fantastic, but insisted on reading the book first.  I'm trying to understand how this book translated into the movie, because frankly I thought the book was dreadfully boring.  I didn't grow to like or dislike anyone.  It seemed that there should have been more meat to the story.  Apparently the actors in the movie did a better job at telling the story than the author did.  This gets a serious pass.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|What do you get if you mash together Bring It On and Coyote Ugly? You get something that's oh-so Pitch Perfect. The Barden Bellas are Barden's first-ever, all-girl a cappella singing group that rely on their looks and antiquated pop songs to get by in competition. After a disasterous incident at the previous year's finals, the Bellas are back and looking to redeem themselves. Enter Beca (Anna Kendrick). Beca's is a girl who's ambitions lie more with DJ'ing than in her studies and lucky for the Bellas, Beca can sing. And if she wants to get ahead in school, she'll have to do it a cappella style. Soon she's breathing new life, a different look and a fresh sound in to the struggling girl group. Add a pinch of friendly rivalry with Barden's all-male a cappella group, The TrebleMakers, a dash of flirtation and a bit of raunchy humour and you're ready to be pitch slapped outta this world!<br /><br />Okay, I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to see Pitch Perfect mostly based on the fact that I can't stand the show, Glee, but I got bored one night with my Netflix queue and decided to give it a whirl. Let me just tell you something right now ---- I am soooooo happy I did because this movie was AMAZING! Seriously. I don't know what it is about these types of movies but they put me on this weird musical high. Yeah. It's freaking crazy!<br /><br />But you know what's even crazier? Just how much I liked the movie despite all the wrongness with it. I mean, there was a lot that didn't really work for me but the fact that the good parts were SO good, it pretty much outweighed all of the bad. Ah, the power of musicals. They can do virtually no wrong in my eyes. And I know I'm kinda categorising Pitch Perfect as a musical, but it isn't so in the traditional sense of the term. The majority of the movie isn't spelled out solely via the song and dance numbers, but the heart of the film does lie in its songs. If you remove everything but the musical numbers, you'd still get the overall essense of the movie sans the raunch and quick-wit. So basically, the whole story is told through the music and I'm very much okay with that.<br /><br />I guess my biggest issue with the film was that the plot was sometimes a little too contrived and some of the chemistry felt forced. For instance, there was an unnecessary love triangle which I totally wasn't buying. In fact, I was even sure it was supposed to be a love triangle. They could've just removed that character and/or bit altogether. Also, much of the raunchier humour (not that there was a lot of it) could've been completely omitted because it just wasn't needed. The movie was funny enough on its own. It was like they were trying to be Bridesmaids only they didn't quite get there.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I will say that the humour of the film was much more elevated than that of most teen comedies today. The comedy lies in the sharp-tongued characters, the witty dialogue and the fact that it wasn't afraid to poke a bit of fun at a cappella while still managing to make it seem super cool. Pitch Perfect verges on the border of satirical without going all the way there, making it more appealing to the masses. Round it out with amazing ad-libbing from Rebel Wilson (love this girl!), Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp and Elizabeth Banks and there's your girl power. Okay, so the guys weren't too bad either.<br /><br />I'd have to say, though, Pitch Pefect's saving grace was in its performances. What I found most impressive was that these actors weren't trained, professional dancers however each of them could really sing. Anna Kendrick knocked it out of the ballpark here. When the groups performed, sparks flew and the musical mash-ups made the movie so memorable. I immediately downloaded the soundtrack after I watched it which has been on replay all week long, I might add! There really isn't much more I can say other than watch it because I think, like me, you'll be pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />Food for Thought: Pitch Perfect is a modern musical that takes a cappella music to the next level, giving it a fresh, modern and pitch perfect feel! I could give or take the plot because the musical numbers are what made it so memorable. This movie was one of the biggest surprises for me so far this year and if you like fun, funky, funny films, I think you'll like this one too.d for Thought: Pitch Perfect is a modern musical that takes a cappella music to the next level, giving it a fresh, modern and pitch perfect feel!

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the graphics were breathtaking. such a good game it is kind of like temple run but you have to stay alert.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a mind blowing experience reading this book has been! I will be forever grateful to everyone involved in bringing this experience to us. Death should hold no fear for any of us.
B008JFUP8A|1.0|I went into this movie halfway expecting it to be yet another great and stunningly visual sci-fi flick in a long line of 2013 scifi releases that have amazed me.  From the previews and the hype I thought this would blow me away being a huge fan of science fiction.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was blown away in ways that are not so good.<br /><br />First, Will Smith should have been the lead actor.  No offense to Jaden but he is most definitely NOT a believable actor (in this film anyway), and the shoes he had to fill for this role were way too large, and he failed miserably at it.  Not saying his father did a very good job either, in fact Will's acting wasn't all that great, so maybe it wasn't acting but rather script writing.<br /><br />I am thinking M. Night Shyamalan has created another disappointment, and has sadly taken the Smith's down his road of horrid movie making.  In a way I'm fairly embarrassed for both Will and Jaden for even being a part of this film, regardless it will look pretty bad on Jaden's resume on future endeavors.<br /><br />But enough about the acting, the visual effects weren't even that great.  To me the movie seemed to have been filmed with the CG effects of 10 years ago rather than the technology that has stunned us with the likes of Avatar, Prometheus, Oblivion, and I hate to say it but HBO's Game of Thrones has more realistic graphics than this sad excuse for a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately M. Night Shyamalan has created not another addition to sci-fi blockbuster movies this year, instead he has only added another reminder as to why I should pay better attention to who the producers and directors are of a film, because I will most definitely never ever again waste my money on a M. Night Shyamalan film ever.<br /><br />Hopefully you enjoy this movie more than I, but if your reading this I would highly suggest you wait to rent it, instead of spending money at a theater.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|this movie was real!  Not nansie-pansie like Superman \\"Unbound\\".  Batman The Dark Knight Returns was believable beginning to end(am referring to parts 1&2)  Unfortunately I watched them in reverse order, as in my friend put them in the caracelle DVD player in the wrong order and I actually thought I was watching 1 when I was watching two.  When I watched one I quickly realized it was before the holicost and was disappointed the ending  had been spoiled for me.  Anyhow, these are great movies, if your fortunate and have the oppertunity to watch them in order.  Part One deals with the mutants and part two with the holicost. The Joker appears briefly in part two in full action, in one he's only a vegetable.  I didn't think I'd be impressed with any animated movie beyond the 1980's but I was pleased with this.  The voice actors weren't all a bunch of kids, in fact, Batman's voice was very mature and so were all the rest.  The writing and acting were mature, not like Superman Unbound which was as bad as most stuff is today.  BTDKR is extremely violent and that is the way I like it, for that is the way of the world of crime fighting and it should be depicted as such.  I loved it! Just like the graphic novel come to life! Had checked it out at the library, now I want a copy of my own!
B001J3U22S|2.0|I had high hopes for this series; however, it fell far short of Frank's opus.  There were too many things left unanswered at the end of the book.  Would not recommend.
B00127RAJY|5.0|When I first started getting serious about getting in shape a few years ago, I did a lot of research about workout DVDs and heard a lot of good things about the 30 Day Shred and, based on word of mouth and the fact that the DVD was pretty cheap, I bought it.  I was vaguely familiar with Jillian Michaels, but had never seen her in action.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into!<br /><br />Jillian uses a \\"3-2-1\\" system, meaning 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  The first time I did the level 1 workout I could barely get through it.  I screamed a few choice words at the Jillian on my TV.  The next day, going down stairs was excruciating.  I kept at it, and it got easier.  Never easy, but I gained endurance.  I got stronger.  I started to see results.  I eventually worked up the courage to try level 2 and level 3.  They were hard.  They got easier, but never easy - just the way a workout should be.<br /><br />I stopped doing the Shred for various reasons and have been doing other workouts over the past couple years, but I recently started doing it again and I found that it is still a terrific workout.  Even though I'm much stronger and in much better shape than I was when I initially started doing this workout, it's still challenging and still gets results.  I can now do level 1 and level 2 back to back!<br /><br />If you're looking for a workout that is highly effective but doesn't take up a lot of your time, I cannot recommend this highly enough.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This was a total work of art and I loved it!  From the clash with the Joker and his demise (Wow....really) and his battle with Superman, it hit every level with me, and I'm easy to please.  The way that Bruce Wayne called it goodbye for his character made sense, but I really didn't want it to go there.  Batman is my favorite and I wanted it to go on and on, however, you have to know when to hit the brakes...and he did.  The new Robin will take some getting use to. I'm not a big fan of hers, so she will have to grow on me.  That being said, I really loved this movie, and I'm sure that this won't be the last.  DC will just make movies of his younger self and I will just buy those like I did this.  GOOD WORK, DC!!!
067144901X|5.0|LaLala. Cute book. Great read. Short enough to hold my babys'attention. She isnt speaking a ton of words yet but she loves the book and even brings it to me to read all the time.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's kind of basic but it was free.  Then again, how many sounds does a person need to be woke up with.  :)
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Once again, these guys just don't quit when it comes to putting together an amazing compilation of music that makes you feel good. The music and the lyrics just flow so well together.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|I'm only now getting used to reading and understanding the authors writing style. More to follow...<br /><br />Still learning the vernacular.
B000000OPQ|5.0|The movie was alright but the music was truly what made the movie worth viewing. With great tracks such as Lunatic Fringe by Red Rider and Change by John Waite, this soundtrack has just the right 'pop' to get you going when you need that nudge in the right direction as well as some good mellow tracks to even it out. A must grab for anyone!
159562015X|4.0|I was very surprised at how fitting, apt and apparently accurate the &#34;strengths' found were for me. Several other people I know all said the same thing.  I am a vocational counselor--what I would like to know more about is precisely how to apply these specific &#34;strengths&#34; are applied on the job. I am sure that they are being applied because I know that StrengthsFinder is being used by the HR department to screen applicants in the third  largest school district in California (Fresno USD) and many corporations in the San Francisco Bay Area. If there was an easy way to quickly apply these strength categories to work I would have given it five stars. I used the coupon in the book to take the test. For $89 I could have gotten a more complete explanation than just my top 5 'strengths'. I am very intrigued by this approach and think it probably has a very positive future.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|What's not to love about this band. Great melodies, amazing mix of horns and guitar, and with Mark Knopfler on lead vocals, these guys are truly timeless.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the movie, so I was curious to see what the book was like.  I am happy to say that I loved the book even more than the movie.  I felt the author had a true understanding of mental health issues and was able to more than adequately portray the depth and complexity of them.  I loved seeing the evolution of Pat's thoughts and actions as he worked towards regaining his sanity.  I will definitely read this book again.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is an extremely hard game, but addicting nonetheless. The premise may seem way too controversial (wipe out the planet with various types of viruses, fungi, etc.), but the play is fun. The only drawback is that in order to really win some games, you have to purchase separately some genes that will help you along the way, even though the game makers say you can unlock them as the game progresses, but you can't progress on some levels without them (I recommend buying the gene that gives you points for popping the blue cure bubbles). Not perfect, but fun.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|\\"The Skin I Live In\\" is Almodovar at his best. Tense, intriguing, with surprising twists and turns, this is great DRAMA!
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|The radio edit of this song is fine, but the full version on Daft Punk's newest album is even better. This will be one of the 2013 Summer anthems.
B00125WAXC|4.0|I got the item today and my uncle will be happy this Father's Day. I want to say thank you very much.
B008EL25LE|3.0|The game is way too short for the price. Gameplay is nice and fluid, but I finished the entire game in less than four hours. Not a shining recommendation.
B00AG297GK|1.0|I'll just make this short and to the point:<br />Borat - stupid and juvenile but very funny.<br />Bruno - stupid and juvenile but funny.<br />Dictator - stupid and juvenile and not the least bit funny.<br /><br />I wasn't \\"offended\\" by anything. It just wasn't funny.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Daft Punk hasn't released an album of new songs since 2005, so it was great to hear their new stuff. They are going in a new direction with this album, so don't expect the same old &#34;Around The World&#34; type of music. One of their best releases.
B008LSVL6U|4.0|The next best thing to being there.  Nice mix.  Great shows.  It is nice seeing the visual to go with the music.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great writing, great acting, lovable characters. Yeah, it's a little weird that they fly around in space ships yet use old-timey weapons, horses, and everything looks like the old west, but that's what Sci-Fi western is supposed to be. It just adds to the charm of the show.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Rather weak ending, but a very entertaining movie.  Any Sci-Fi fan should see it, but just once.  Won't leave any lasting memories.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Too bad it is the last book but a good ending none the less. Looking for a new series from her.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Jason Todd has always been a favorite character of mine, I love anti-heroes. This film is great in the fact that it covers one of my most loved story arcs from the Bat series. I only wish it could have been longer (100 min would have been a better choice) but like most DC animations its only 75 min.<br /><br />I hope DC decides to do an animation of the Hush storyline now...
B001FVV2X2|5.0|ILOVE Fringe! I didn't realize some of the little bits and pieces missed just from commercials like the Observers popping up during a scene! So glad this is on Amazon!!!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I really like this game, only problem is that sometimes it doesn't work correctly and respond fast enough. but overall a very good game for free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is creative and fun for everyone I like to play all the creative games and I like challenging games
B0072X2O66|5.0|Take a few exceptionally talented musicians from some Heavy metal and prog metal bands and put them together to make a straight up hard rock record and this is what you get.  Very catchy tunes, great musicianship and great songwriting make this a CD you dont want to pass up.  NOW, if you are a fan of any of the bands that the members are in outside of Adrenaline Mob and are expecting a (Dream Theater, Symphony X, etc) record, you will likely be disappointed because this record is not like those bands.  Their intention was to put out a straight up in-your-face record and they have succeeded admirably.  Their other CD &#34;Coverta&#34; which is a collection of 8 covers of some of the bands favorite tunes is amazing as well.  So, to summarize, if you want a progressive metal CD Dont buy this, but if you are a fan of great hard rock well then welcome to the promised land!
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Story was well constructed and kept interest going.  I am pretty sick of gay and lesbian inclusions, however.  Think the movie would have been better leaving the sex out.<br />  Gee....a lot of us just like a really good story with a satisfying conclusion to the plot.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Love their energy music and interpretation, they are even better in concert!<br /><br />Looking forward to many more songs and chances to hear them.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Easy to follow exercises.  Eigth mins into it and Im already breaking a sweat.  It fits perfectly in my busy schedule!!! Oh yeah, did I mention you WILL be sore?!<br /><br />As far as the knee impact, I take it easy and do what I can at my own speed, even if I have to pause it to finish a rep.
B004NELBPC|4.0|I downloaded Huff Post to my Kindle Fire and enjoy reading the &#34;news&#34; there.  It's easy to use and entertaining if nothing else.  GPS for your Soul is always a good source of info.
B009RH9HDS|2.0|After using this case for approximately 6 Months I feel that I'm better off purchasing a new case. I'll start with the most annoying reason I'm doing this. After all the use, the handle/strap has left two indents in the screen of my kindle where the strap rubs on the screen when the case is closed. Fortunately I had purchased a screen protector, unfortunately this will also have to be replaced when I replace the case, as the indents are permanent. Also, after 6 months, the elastic strap used to hold the case closed has begun to wear out. It would be much simpler if the case had a magnet in place to hold the cover shut. It's not a terrible car for a first timer, but in the long term, consider purchasing something else
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf must be one of those instant classic movies.  Will Ferrell at his best.  Funny and entertaining.  A Christmas classic in my house!
B0053KWDES|5.0|Just like the title :)) I really like this fiio e11, sound is good,bass is great!!! I would rather use this one all the time than my beats
B00A77II0U|5.0|Best seek and find yet!!!  Amazing storyline. Great puzzles, interesting from beginning to end. Can't wait to see what comes out next!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Great view and i have a page it works<br />alot i love this app and hoping everyone would love it but of corse u have to have a facebook.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|My gf and watched this movie and we hated it. There are some funny parts but the rest of the movie is absolutely depressing and not fun at all.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is non stop action and surprises galore.  Great world building, characters you love or hate-there's so much to love about this book.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I enjoyed the book and even stayed up late to finish reading it. Loved it and happy how it turned out.
0385523904|5.0|I have watched many documentaries and read several books about North Korea, but this is such a candid tale of what life was really like for those who lived in North Korea during the famine. Everyone needs to read this book. After reading this book, it is impossible for you to feel sorry for yourself and what is going on in your own life.<br /><br />My favorite part is towards the end you find out how all of the people mentioned in the book are doing today. It's a sad story with a happy ending.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie depicts the reality of functional addicts. Denzel did a great job and the movie has a powerful message. Highly recommending this one.
0393317552|5.0|This is one of my all time great books. However, if you take my advice you'll skip the introduction and start on Page 36.  Why skip the introduction? Well, if you've ever watched professional fights, you know that some great fighters get off to a slow start, and it seems Mr. Diamond has that problem.<br /><br />There's another reason to skip the introduction. It's not only boring and irrelevant to the story, it gives the impression that he's a flaming liberal trying to prove no culture is superior to another. In fact, the book is about where and how civilization originated and propagated. There's no social message either way, just great and interesting content.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|This was a pretty good movie with great actors. It had some predictable parts, but overall solid movie and recommended.
0307477479|5.0|Most chapters of this novel work incredibly well as self contained short stories. Some connect together in ways both large and tenuous and give you an \\"a-ha!\\" moment. Some could almost border post-modern formal exercise territory. So, I can see why some readers are somewhat unsure what to make of this novel - but all of that being said, I think Egan has done a masterful job of giving you just enough pieces of the puzzle to be able to weave a coherent, straight ahead narrative, if that's your bent. On the other hand, the themes and times she tackles with sure handed technique that would fizzle in lesser hands are anything but coherently straight forward, and I think that's part of the point of the formal choices she deftly executes. Growing up, growing old, selling out, art vs commerce, living by ones ideals vs putting food on the table, overcoming the past, surviving the future: these are some of the motifs that weave their way through these richly told chapters. Whenever a writer steps out onto the cutting edge in terms of formal playfulness/innovation, to me the greatest pitfall they always risk is sacrificing the human heart and soul in their characters. Yet, what grabbed me almost immediately and riveted me chapter after chapter is how warmly and sympathetically the author treats the souls that populate her world. I constantly found myself in total empathy with a vast array of people, nodding my head, thinking \\"yes, this nails what it is to be alive\\" and this shining, powerful gift is Egan's greatest achievement. My life is richer for having read it - you can't ask for more than that from the arts. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who is after an intelligent read by an author at the top of her game.
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|Not a lot happens in this movie.  Lots of talk talk talk, punctuated by intense, yet brief action sequences.  Not recommended.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Even though there were many parts of the movie that I somewhat enjoyed, because of the &#34;edge of your seat&#34; reaction, at the end of the movie I was confused and upset. I like a nice ending or at least an ending that makes sense, to me this did not.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Wonderful movie, very spiritual. The cinematography is beautiful. It is a movie the whole family can enjoy. I highly recommend.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|The cd was great and if you try hard enough you can decode the letters in the pictures. Great cd from HIM.
159463176X|2.0|I am absolutely heart broken with Hosseine's new book.  I just could not wait to read it as I had so loved 'The Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns'.  This new book should have been three.  There were too many plots and too many characters for one saga.  I finished it as I felt something must improve.  So sad. It did not.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I do think the collections shouldn't be impossible to get. There is always one that is nearly impossible and then there are the people who are always getting bingo after three numbers. Really?!
125000098X|5.0|As usual, Jeffrey Archer is great.  I have never read a bad book that he has written.  I could not put it down and gave up going to other activities so that I could finish it.  I was home bound for 48 hours.  Just wonderful.  Thank you Mr. Archer for a fantastic read.  So looking forward to your next one...don't wait too long!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Pros: Very comfortable, decent range, decent sound quality.<br /><br />Cons: High chance of getting a lemon.<br /><br />This is my second G930.  I had the first one for about 2 years before it reached a point where I could no longer stand using it.  This headset came almost as bad as my 2 year old G930.  Anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours the headset will lose connection to the computer and go silent for a few seconds, then reconnect.  It usually happens about 10 times a day which for a new product is pretty unacceptable.<br /><br />My previous experience with this headset was less than stellar as it did the same thing to a lesser degree since it was new.<br /><br />Unfortunately I would recommend to stay away from this product because it seems there is a high likelihood of receiving a lemon headset.  If you are willing to take the risk of possibly returning the headset one or two times before you get what you paid for, then go for it.
B004A8ZWW4|1.0|The kid in this movie is just a bad over-actor who you constantly want to just Shut up.  The remaining cast do what they can with a script gone bad......way bad.<br />Wherever you do don't buy this POS it is not even worth shipping.
B00005K424|5.0|This is a smaller (but still very playable) Quarto set. It's perfect for travel, and made completely of beautifully stained wood. The pieces come in a nice little travel bag (though the bag is too small to fit the actual board itself). Don't believe anything you hear about it having magnetic pieces, though - there were no such magnets in the set I ordered.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen as far as moral, character and integrity.  A definite must see movie.
1451673442|5.0|I have enjoyed watching &#34;The Secret&#34; so therefore I know that this book will be a plus to the info<br />I have learned from the other book.
1423165691|5.0|I was thrilled when the book arrived at my house. I love the fact that this book looks and feels like you just snatched a sketchbook off of the table of a Disney Animator. I am sooooo glad I got this!
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|This is my all-time favorite film. I heard about it in 1978 but never got around to watching it. I finally watched it sometime in the mid 80's on video tape. Since then I've watched the movie maybe a dozen times or more. Each time I am amazed by the movie's intensity and attention to detail. Brad Davis gave an outstanding performance and could have had a stellar career had he followed this with a few more equally compelling roles. John Hurt put in, what I feel was an award winning performance. This is one of those movie definitely worth watching a few times.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love how it's very challenging at first and then gets way easier when you update all the vehicles because you get way more coins!
B0036G8IQS|4.0|Really good had a nice story plot<br />I love the things about the Greek gods and demigod and stuff like that
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the book, it was great I kept on reading and reading!!!!!!!!!! The best book i have read ever
B00457X7IQ|5.0|love these books ive nearly finished the third one already.<br />the story sucks you in, and u need to keep reaing wanting to know more.<br /><br />love it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good I loved it. It is fun awesome great challenging and it takes strategy very hard at first but you get better and better and better as you go along I had a lot of fun playing this game great focus game to keep your mind occupied
B000002KXV|5.0|Althoug short in lenght, 39 minutes, all the cuts are pure gems. CD came in excellent shape. Will keep playing until I can play along...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very awesome game better than farming games. Lots of stuff to do. And it's not that expensive to play. Fun game very addictive be sure to not get too addicted. Love it so much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have never had a problem with this app. It's good I enjoy playing it! I would recommend this to anyone who loves solitary.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|With a tale of three dead infants spread across the provinces of Canada, Reichs managed to keep me on the edge of my seat, throughout what would make a very thick paperback.<br />The subplots made it more interesting, though a little fuzzy in my memory.<br /><br /> A little romantic triangle spices this one up, and the title hints at the hidden treasure.<br />I latched onto \\"Bones\\" first on TV, and since dinnertime was always the time to discuss gross or painful subjects, they haven't shot one scene that I would give 5 stars for grossness.  The reference to the show \\"Bones\\" caught me, in in an airport bookstore, between flights. Then I had to find each novel Dr Reichs wrote.<br />I find the TV personalities rather pale compared to the character development in the books,  surely a much more Believable Brennan. Her Brennan is not emotionless, like the Bones of TV. She/Reichs has a wry sense of humor which pops up in humorous crime scene descriptions:  \\"salvation army chic,\\" \\"Paradise Resort....better name would be Last Resort.\\"<br />All in all, enjoyable. Short of 5 stars, because of the length, unexplained terms, and slang, 4.5 stars.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is genius!! Daft punk wanted to capture the sounds of the late 70s /early 80s California music such as doobie bros,fleetwood mac,etc. The album has a strong disco influence which all of daft punks music is inspired by.  Yes ill admit its not the old daft punk we are all used to, but im glad they can show the talent they have and not do the same music over and over. Daft Punk are usaully the trend setters and are at least ahead 5 years with their albums. Im glad they went to their roots of their inspiration
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is what I've been looking for. I love the mix choices to make the relaxing sounds to what is all your likes. 3 types of white noise frequencies so you have a choice. Merge two or more as if they were recorded that way. Try it out because I think you will choose the pro.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Some have characterized this as a chick flick or a movie that makes you cry.  I prefer to look at it as an inspirational movie.  Well made and well acted with a true story to boot.  Are there really children in the world this involved.  See it!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It Works great. Scans apps at install and cleaned up garbage stuff. My tablet runs better now and no crashing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun and addicting game, once you start its hard to put down. Also great time passer while waiting for your doctor, and any other appointment.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While not exactly an accurate description of a true BDSM lifestyle, it it does capture the spirit. It is a love story, exploring the struggles of two people from polar opposing worlds trying to meet in the middle, looking for acceptable compromises to build a lasting relationship on. I absolutely loved it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, must have for weather updates any town, city, state of ur choice plus ur own town at the same time.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I like this book AND it is my favorite book. It is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Secret Daughter was well written, good characters and an insight into India by Americans involved in the plot to adopt a child.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This is possibly the most poorly-written book I have read in years.  Without commenting on the ending itself, I can say that, if Ms. Harris actually wrote this book, she must have been angry that she had to bother.  The entire thing read like a first draft that was hurriedly dashed off to meet a deadline, with no rewrites, no proofing, no copy-editing, no thought to continuity or consistency.<br /><br />Sookie, despite the heartbreak, the torture, the fear she has endured, was once a gentle, caring person.  In DEA, she is hard, coarse, flippant.  Her great love for Eric seems no more than an annoyance, as is Bill's for Sookie.  In fact, Bill almost seems to delight in Eric abandoning her.<br /><br />The plot(s) were ludicrous and laughable.  Sam having to appeal to Eric for bail money?  Sam owns many properties in Bon Temps, so a loan on them was a given.  And why not ask Bill?  He has money.  But then there would be no idiotic story line of Eric continuing to \\"own\\" Sookie.<br /><br />There are other authors who have long-running series who ran out of steam (and ideas) many books ago.  Ms. Harris has joined their company.  Now I can write Sookie's \\"end\\" in my head, and forget this sad mess of a book.
0380789019|5.0|I read American Gods recently and liked that book, so I jumped on another of his. This book was really good. He can spin the tale of another world in a very convincing fashion. Getting a unique world believable is tough, but he pulls it off very well. I liked the story too and all the different things that appear to be the same in our world, but are different in the underworld of London, well...just neat. A excellent read.
B008602KQI|4.0|This tale is one of the best Science Fiction accounts that really makes you think about no matter how bad things seem now, it could be much worse.  It reminds us that having too much power can be destructive.  It speaks to youth about values we hold dear and can lose unless we make it a priority to pass on to those we love.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow amazing!! It got my attention from the moment that I started reading it!! I can't wait to read the 3rd book!!
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|When I first started listening to bgwtb I had no idea it was made in 09, I just thought layne had lost some of his scream.  I was shocked when I found out the album was only recently put out.  I was also shocked there was a whole new album of Alice in chains to take in, they had definitely shifted into a new gear I was really digging - to me the intensity of this album is a few steps stronger than anything else they put out, looking forward to finalizing this review when the album shows up
0393317552|4.0|A very interesting point of view is put forth by the author of this book. The geographic and climatic influence on human history is hypothesized, and evidence is presented in its favour. The evidence seems compelling, well-documented, plenty of citations are provided for those who wish to dig further. The graphical way of providing some information is very good. Overall, this is an easy read for someone who does not have a formal background in anthropology. Granted that some sections of the book seem over-simplified, but that is bound to happen when someone tries to fit in the scope of human history in one book. The primary point in its favour would be that the author does not try to intentionally push factually inaccurate information onto the reader.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is the greatest thing in the history of things! A must buy for fans of horror and zombies. Three versions of the best zombie movie ever with plenty of extras. Buy this!
B003O86FMW|2.0|Edge of the seat or couch entertainment . Especially liked the love story evolving in this book.  The gory parts are just the cherry on top. Cant wait to see how the next  part of the trilogy ends. Love lost or love found. Your guess is as good as mine
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|It's a Die Hard movie and it is good, just a little different than some of the others but so was the last one with his daughter in it.  I liked it a lot and if you are a fan you will too.  Don't expect it to be something it is not.
B008N1V11U|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone..it is challenging graphics are great! Very good pick if you like playing good game
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Loved this CD...great voice, excellent guitarist.  If you like Leo Kotke, you'll love Joe Bonamassa. Also loved the fact that it was an accoustic, live performance.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Action packed movie, of course. The bathroom scene was one of my favorites. The cool car scene was good. Cruise is playing up his trademark cool. The only thing is it isn't a character. It is just Tom Cruise in yet another script. Tom Cruise is like a Barbie, dress them up any way you want it is still Barbie. Tom Cruise never acts, he is just Tom Cruise and screenplays keep getting written for him. Because, we all must really like Tom Cruise. Even enough to see him in any situation. There was a scene that sums up the movie pretty well. The regular cop says to Cruise something like, \\"we have similar jobs\\". Reacher was an ex-military cop. Cruise replies, \\"Except all the bad guys I was after were trained killers.\\" Then that trademark head tilt, I am serious Tom Cruise look. Fight scenes are good, classic car, and interesting plot. What more could one ask of an action movie?
B003DCTC6K|4.0|I am generally not into these period pieces but a friend of mine recommended this show as being one of his top 20. I watched it and found it rather entertaining and have now recommended it to my wife.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Wish I had more friends. Otherwise the graphics are good. Where do you find help? How do you occupy other players?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series opened the way for me to look up other british-produced series, enjoying them immensely.I will continue to seek out the programs.
1416511946|5.0|My son purchased this for a friend and it met all his expectations.  My son also read it and said he was very impressed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|There have been many wonderful English drama series over the years, but none that have captivated so many as the Downton Abbvey series.  The cast of characters is MARVELOUS, the acting SUBLIME, and the storyline absolutely ENTHRALLING !!!!!  Every actor becomes a part of us, even the ones we come to dislike immensely.  There are times we even root for them, while hating their wicked deeds.  And of course, we wish the loveable characters like Mrs. Hughes and Mrs. Patmore could be a part of our own family.  The depth of the characters is fantastic and I am looking forward to season 4, although I am so sad that Matthew is gone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has very good graphics and I would recommend this game for<br />anyone and everyone, though sometimes I find my myself running out of money quit quickly,
B005FLX2WC|5.0|After hearing this CD, I would Buy More CDs by her, really like some songs on this Cd, Good blues.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really love playing this game.  It gives me a release from stress and my granddaughter taught me how to play it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|its a great application! I can just download a song or video in a touch of a button. works great with my kindle besides the miniscule crashes that rarely happen. KINDLE FIRE USERS!! DOWNLOAD THIS APP!! phone users have problems but not the kindle! :D
0385536828|2.0|Really difficult to get into and led nowhere - have not bothered to finish - diappointed<br />have liked previous books by same author. Why do all Amazon reviews appear to have 4 stars for every book?
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great read. She did a wonderful job writing from the mans POV; I actually had to check to see if a guy wrote this! It was funny & sweet with good banter & angst.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|Pierce Brosnan as his best representation of James Bond.  I bought this because 1) I have seen the film before and liked the chase in the parking garage, and 2) the price was low enough to entice me.
0762777931|5.0|This is a fantastic book! Kris takes some complicated information and presents it in an easy to read format. This will not be the last time I buy one of her books!
B008P9M614|4.0|If you have seen the series then you already know Greg House, you either love him or love to hate him.  Great set with behind the scenes interviews and commentaries.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|JT what can we say? he is ridiculously good and we see him in concert every chance we get. AWESOME
B0000640RX|5.0|If ur a fan you'll love it. If not ur not a Fan U won't. I must say good memories.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Was in this musical in the 80's and was one of the last I performed. It is great to see it revived after nearly 20 years into a movie
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Easy, fun relaxation.  Nice graphics.  Enough of a puzzle challenge to keep it interesting.  Worth the two dollars I spent.
B007DIQC90|5.0|They took us back. Their music is a rare find along with their voices. This is a MUST have for your collection
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very awesome!!  I just love it.my kids love it my whole family loves it.  five stars is what it dedevers
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I've listened to them since the EARLY 80's when they hit the stage first time. You cannot go wrong with Depeche Mode
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Great story, it's riveting to follow Robert and his new adventure.<br /><br />Loved all the characters, they bring so much to the story, learned a great deal about Masons, noetic science, and the bible.<br />Some of the detail descriptions of historical references can get a bit hard to understand but an open mind will allow for your mind to explore new views on ancient writings and schools of thought.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|She is wonderful, she is fantastic, she is Adele.  Took us by surprise and won all of us over with her emotions. She is TERRIFIC
B00007J5VN|4.0|I chose this rating because it is original, not a sequel, and a bit quirky.  Shirley Maclaine is dazzling as &#34;Sweet Charity&#34;, and portrays the innocence and charm and sparkle needed to carry this character off.  Bob Fosse's choreography adds nicely to the quirky flavor of the story.  Loved the music selections.  I would have given this movie five stars but I'm a sucker for a happy ending.  The story offers your choice of two endings but the happy ending choice was too saccharin for my liking.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|After following Sookie's journey I have to honestly say that I found this a slightly disappointing final chapter to what has been a fantastic series.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this book! It kept me on my toes! I love  how it came together. It had good humor and I felt compassion for Jamie and Lily. I loved th  characters. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is an awesome game I love it its fun and u explore a lot I get to excited if I got a new high score you or anyone will love it, its better than the first one I hope they make more games. yahhhhh this is totally awesome I give it a five stars!!!!&lt;3 love it!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this games is the best I play it all the time it has difrent places but it does have a lot of adds plus it is free
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a great game so far, but have experienced very little player interaction whether it be trying to make allies, or counter attacks from other players. I'm hoping most of the players are out of my player range.<br /><br />The games campaign is fun, regardless though.
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|good app but it keeps freezing and force closing. wish I could get my money back. free apps are better
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Lol wut?  How did you think it &quot;scanned&quot; the paper?...osmosis?<br /><br />This is a great app.  I've tried it a couple of times and  they came out great.  Make sure you have good lighting.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Full detail<br />Awesome story about true hero's who work for me you and every one<br />Now I want to be in the armed forces
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my sister while she was on bed rest.  She (and her husband) loved it.
B005QUQP76|3.0|Im a MMO gamer and not really a first person shooter gamer either.  STO, SWTOR and GW2 are my main games.  That said I would like to use the progammable red &#34;sniper&#34; button for some functions but I can't get it to do anything.  I have downloaded and installed both the firmware update and the software/driver.  I also bought the K90 keyboard which I give 5 stars in another review. The top of the mouse is smooth while the sides have a more tactile (gritty, rougher) feel which took getting use to after my Razor. The &#34;back&#34; button (usually known as mouse button 4, but is mouse button 8 here) is very slim and hard to find. I use this button normally for team voice chat but its almost too hard to find when in active play and to hard to push and keep a good grip on the mouse.  Overall the look and feel of the mouse in hand is good. I love the blue lit top buttons and adjustable (weight) heavy metal main body and scroll wheel.  Not sure if it's the mouse's fault but I have found the mouse cursor is too slick at my normal setting and too slow at the one notch lower setting.
B004A3KPYY|5.0|I first heard this ethereal album on vinyl in the '70s when it was originally released. Very beautiful, unique music; it's wonderful to meditate, relax, etc. with this on as background or focus. I loved it then on vinyl, and I love it still; I'm delighted it's available as an MP3. It's going on my iPod as soon as I get the chance.
B00B5ACNRM|5.0|Love the two disc edition. Great service and delivery. The family movie night was very pleased with the buy and a nice addition to our collection.
0375507256|5.0|Ethan wrote an excellent review on this book and should first be read by anyone considering purchasing it.<br /><br />I gave Cloud Atlas a five star review because it is phenomenal artistic writing at its best.  Now, having said that, I was really confused with the plot.  I thought that the author, David Mitchell, was nuts!  How could he write such drivel?  There was not even one instance in which I had an 'ahha' moment.  I just scratched my head as I read, puzzled. I had to go to Wikipedia to read a synopsis of Cloud Atlas and it was then that I understood the first character, David Ewing, was being poisoned by a doctor, Dr. Goose, who wanted his gold.  I was confused as to how all of the characters, like Frobisher and Sexsmith and Sonmi451 and Luisa Rey and Timothy Cavendish had to do with one another in each of their lives.<br /><br />Once the movie came out I thought that my questions would be answered clearly, that I would understand more.  Much to my chagrin it was a film exactly like the book in every way.  So, I was still puzzled.  I was disappointed as I truly wanted to see if I had read the book the way it was intended.  Yup!  I sure did and I saw the movie twice just to confirm this.  But an interesting thing happened in my confusion.<br /><br />Both the book and the movie made me think of the characters and the plot for quite some time afterwards.  Yes, I did scratch my head with puzzlement, I even cursed at the author a few times, but if a book can make you do this, perhaps its worthwhile.  Cloud Atlas is not a book you can skim over.  It's not even a book you can sit down and read from front to back quickly or, I might add, easily.  It's a book that makes you think.  And any book that can do that is certainly worth the money.  I came away thinking that David Mitchell is likely ahead of his time with regard to the written word, plot, setting and character and that is truly a marvelous legacy, don't you think?
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I love the Eagles and watching the behind the scenes was great. To see all they went through as a group was crazy. And of course love the music and learning how they came up with the some of the titles and songs that they did was exceptional!
B00BPA7U34|5.0|If there was a reincarnation of Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble is it! The sweetness and soul of his music makes you want to buy every album he has made. He is the very best singer around that has taken over the mantle from FS.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I loved the movie! It was very interesting and exiting to watch I have watched it three times already and will again!
B00B4804KS|4.0|Jurassic Park is a fun-filled movie and very exciting. Mr Speilberg's remake in 3D has added more depth into the movie. If it were initially filmed in 3D , angles would have been used to give the movie added &#34; in your face&#34; special effects. As is, the movie had excellent quality but not the true feeling of coming a you that you would see in 3D produced movies. It is well worth the money if you own a 3D Blue Ray DVD Player and a 3D TV.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|I have owned and listened to this cd for forty years, and I have to say that for its time and milieu it is nothing short of daring and brilliant.  I often wonder how Morrison and crew could have conceived of such an arrangement of haunting, mood-inducing, primitive and archetypal sounds--so lovely and provoking. You only have to imagine a rainy, melancholy day (Rimbaud? Beaudelaire?) and staring out of a window as rain drops slide down the pane--the ultimate Romantic sensibility.  Yes, the easy answer is drugs, and there is plenty of drug-induced emotions and sounds on this cd, but it touches something wonderfully primeval and free, a gypsy-like tour-de-force of rock indulgence and creative angst.  I consider this cd to be one of the most creative and innovative recordings of its time, and if you will only listen to Morrison's incredible baritone and the instrumentals by the rest of the band (Ray M's classically trained rifts)you can only regard this as one of the finest and most imaginative recordings (yes, moody and dark, but wonderfully so) for its time. The \\"UnKnown Soldier\\" is one of the finest anti-war songs I've ever heard and \\"Love Street\\" is a knock-out song that is always psychically rejuvenating.  \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" the pop hit on this cd--although a decent song--is the weakest. Still, this is a pivotol cd in rock history.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Not quite up to the standard of his other album; however, it is melodious and still emotes strong feelings of love and simplicity
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I enjoy all but one aspect of the game. . .you cannot simply keep playing.. Zen games should be non-stop to truly embrace the the Zen aspiration.  Keeping track of the number of fruits sliced is nice, but how many slipped through my fingers and not my knife?  I've scored 181 fruits without any guru items, but I don't know if any slipped by or not, all I know is I have to start over again (already?  I just started slicing!);  seems a bit anti-zen to me.  I would rather try to see how long I can slice before one slips by intact.  Can I do it for five minutes?  Ten minutes?  I will never know. . . until the next version, perhaps!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I switched from Swype to give this a try. SwiftKey is more accurate and easier to use. With the added bonus of the ability to use two languages simultaneously.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Loved the movie! Loved the quality of the film images. Mint condition, affordable and worth every penny! Thank you for the dvd.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I wasn't even able to get through the tutorial before it crashed,  and now it wont open! waste of time.
0761169431|5.0|I would not buy this for someone who isnt experienced in origami but for my friend who she LOVED it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you Hugh Howey, for giving me a new society to obsess about.  Post-apocolyptic societies let us dream of what we wish life could and should be.  Your depiction of life (and changing lives) in the silo is compelling.  I enjoyed taking this journey with your well-written characters.<br /><br />I really, really want to know what Silo 40 is up to!  Please keep the stories coming.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Blue rays are so pricey even when they are outdated. This one was a good find and in great condition.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I loved this movie, and I wasn't sure I would.  The work the animators did with the bear, however - without spoilers, I just want to say it was spectacular, and more than a little bit touching.  Well done!
B0012GMXYM|3.0|This a classic album for Santana fans,of course,but the description for the product and the fact that it was also recently included in a 5-disc &#34;Legacy&#34; package led me to believe it had been remastered. But no,it was the exact same disc that I had bought in 1990.<br />So,better be more specific in your description !
B00007GZR5|5.0|It also touches a point that we may all wonder about.  What does life teach us and how do we deal with the journey of our individual lives.  The creative visuals are amazing.  Any artist will watch this movie in wonder.  Good for adults and perhaps older teens who are prepared to see the hardships life can deal us.  Brilliantly acted and directed.
1616550414|5.0|As a longtime Zelda fan this is a piece you're going to want to have! Awesome illustrations and beautiful presentation! Two thumbs up!
B000FVQLRA|5.0|It's a good movie to see the realities of war and it's tragedies. Must to watch over and over. Good for adults but perhaps not appropriate for young children.  Very moving.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this movie! I watch it all the time, if you want a great movie this is what your looking for. there is great actors in this movie. I loved it and im pretty sure you guys will to.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I started reading this series as a college freshman when the first book was published over 23 years ago. This is an excellent and fitting conclusion to a story that has been part of over half of my life. Great job by Brandon Sanderson in tying up so many loose ends and doing justice to Robert Jordan's masterpiece.

B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Ms. Mvula's style is hard to categorize but it's a unique pleasure to listen to her songs. Can't to see her in person.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good entertainment. My eleven year old granddaughter loves to play it. It keeps her busy. I think younger children would also enjoy it.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I rented this movie reluctantly. I am an old school Trek fan and was quite used to seeing Shatner and Nemoy on the screen. I thought for sure that I couldn't be satisfied by this modern interpretation, but I was wrong. Presented is some interesting &#34;Pre Enterprise&#34; history of the characters. The story line was true Roddenberry style, and I was absorbed by it in minutes. By the end I was a solid &#34;Fan&#34; of this film, and am anxious to see the latest &#34;Star Trek&#34; film out there. I recommend it to any Trek people. It was entertaining and fun to watch.

B0063IH60K|4.0|The multiplayer level always gives you a new challenge against different people.  If the challenge becomes to much you can play a random game or a winner game that is still possible to lose.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My family loved this movie. It's our favorite out of all of the series so far. VERY funny!! We've watched it several times!
B008I34ZFW|2.0|I wanted to like Iron Sky.  Heck I wanted to LOVE Iron Sky.  Moon Nazis versus President Sarah Palin?  Who wouldn't love that?<br /><br />But it found it mediocre at best, boring and lifeless most of the time.<br /><br />Let's take the good, the effects are surprisingly decent, there occasionally funny bits for example when the President uses Nazi propaganda in her re-election campaign or North Korea attempting to take credit for the Nazi invasion.<br /><br />But a lot of times there are bits that could be funny but never make it.  Take President Palin (who is never actually named).  Other than the inherent humor of the idea the joke never goes anywhere, it just sits there as if President Palin all by herself is funny enough.  One of her schemes is to put an African American astronaut on the moon with the slogan \\"Black to the Moon\\", later we learn the astronaut is just a male model hired for his looks.  It's a plot that could be cutting or biting but the filmmakers don't really pull it together.<br /><br />On the whole the movie had to be more over the top, or more subtle, as it is it's not quite there.<br /><br />It was a, OK rental but I wouldn't bother buying it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a story that includes often horrible events of a young girls's terribly troubled childhood that eventually lead to her maturation. It features great emotional achievement on her road towards redemption. There is an ongoing mystery about her benefactor that adds to the interest of the reader. Could not put down this book.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|Bought these batteries for my car remotes, the remotes stop working after one week.  I thought I had to reprogram my remotes, took them to a locksmith and paid $10 each for new batteries for my 2 remotes that work fine now.  Sometimes you get what you pay for!!!
B0000C9JCM|5.0|I don't know who picked the cover art for this cd, but even though it is a cute drawing it TOTALLY messes with the actual contents of this beautiful piece of music. I wouldn't have picked it up if I had seen it on a shelf for sale, thinking it was a comic throw down to Pachelbel's once-in-a-lifetime composition. Musically, it is a gorgeous compilation and the vocal piece is amazing. I find that if I am down, blue, over-anxious, stretched too thin or just in a plain lousy mood, Pachelbel's Canon will bring me out of it in the snap of a finger. I was once told that this simple composition works on certain parts of the brain that help release relaxation hormones and also, opens the mind to spiritual pathways. I BELIEVE IT. It is a gorgeous musical experience...&#34;don't judge a book (cd) by its cover&#34;!!!
1603429999|4.0|Though I may not do all the projects in the workshop, many will see my attention.  I knit left handed, so being able to take my time with directions and pictures is really important.  There aren't many lefties out there who also publish and the information here is presented well enough I can use it &#34;backwards.&#34;  Part way through my second pair of socks, and will tackle a sweater next.  Debating on doing a sample from this book first, prior to a full size one for me, so I get it right.  If you have not knit in the round before, I recommend this book.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I love this app because it 's entertaining and easy to use!!!!! You can win,  but if your set to single player it 's harder because your facing a computer.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|Thanks for the movie that includes Eva Mendes and has the Miami nightlife and cars, cars, cars, for those of us who like that kind of Fun.  This movie is in excellent condition and came with speedy delivery.  I will use this seller over and over.
B005FISBTO|4.0|The way it was written and presented clashes with how most of the previous seasons were staged. Without spoiling anything, too much of the season's primary story arc is right in your face, and it massively deflates what could have been a much stronger story otherwise. Put simply, they show too much and they tell too much, and far too soon. The viewer is privy to information that they shouldn't be for the sake of a cheap fake-out later on in the season.<br /><br />Not my favorite season, but it's still a great run regardless. The best part is definitely how the season ended.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Hilarious, exciting, and the suspense is enough to keep you watching one right after the other! Great season, definitely filled every expectation I had of the Dexter series!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Lots of great character growth and development, and an amazing handling of previous season's big reveal. The story and events ebb and flow seamlessly. To date, my most favorite season.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I could not put this book down. I read it almost in one go.<br /><br />I took it seriously because it was written by a Neurosurgeon who knows how the brain works.
B0085TJUGI|5.0|This book comes at a good time in my life, confirming things I've suspected for a long time.  In my 62 years I've long felt that beliefs I'd been given were not quite on the mark in terms of our place in the world and creation.  Recently I've found more and more confirmation that &#34;we don't go to 'heaven', we grow to 'heaven'.
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|Don't bother paying for this.  I got it because it was the free app of the day, and I still deleted it.<br /><br />1. The controls suck (you &#34;catch&#34; the ball like a magnet if you push on the guy with the ball anywhere near you, and instead of hitting  it, they control more like angry birds slingshot techniques. So rather than a smooth foosball motion, it's more like catch and pass untill you reach the goal.<br /><br />2. The game is boring and you can't play someone unles on a tablet -- even then the controls make it boring and annoying as all hell.<br /><br />If I could give it 0/5 stars, I would, as the ONLY good thing I can say about it is that it looks pretty...but even that pisses me off, because now I know where they get the AUDACITY to charge money for this POS.<br /><br />Like I said, skip it.  Even for FREE, it isn't even worth a fraction of my 64 gigs
B0033TJATW|5.0|great, bought back memories from when i was a kid and loved to look at moon walker just as i remembered
0307352153|5.0|I've been a psychotherapist for 45 years, but still found this a compelling read.  The message is simple, but no less dramatic for its simplicity.  What a world this would be if we found children (and adults) who are quiet to be as interesting as those who are &#34;...so good with people&#34;, or &#34;so gregarious&#34;.  We truly do reward extroversion and punish introversion, in ways that are invisible to most of us.  But they are not invisible to introverts, who always wonder what is the matter with them.  For parents, for pediatricians, for marriage counselors, for introverts, themselves, this is essential reading.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I just wish it wasn't the last in the series.  I enjoyed these books so much.  Thank you Charlaine Harris for giving me so many hours to escape my own reality and put myself somewhere else
1476712042|4.0|I thought this would be something of the supernatural kind.  I didn't really know what I was reading.  It was an OK read, and I love romance.  I just don't think its ALL THAT though, in my humble opinion.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I was very excited to read this novel, not only because of the setting and period, but also to see how the \\"competition\\" between the protagonists (two magicians' apprentices who were bound to the competition by said magicians while they were still children) played out and how their love story factored into all of this.  From the way it was marketed, I expected something epic and sweeping, or at least more suspenseful than what I found my experience to be.  There was no \\"competition\\" to speak of, to be honest.  The protagonists spent years (decades, if I'm not mistaken) trying to best each other with their creative circus attractions.  The penalty for losing this interior design contest is death; other rules were never made clear, one of many vague (undeveloped) aspects of the novel.  The love story was very mild; the competitors fall in love through their shared experience of being involuntarily bound to the contest, and their admiration of each other's work.<br /><br />I was hoping the ending would make sense of the rest of the story, but the only thing I got from it was an explanation as to why the two (immortal???) magicians were at odds with each other in the first place, and a poetic discourse on the art of storytelling.<br /><br />Other bits and pieces:<br />Way, way too descriptive.  Gargantuan paragraphs are used to describe details that do nothing to move the story forward.  This tired me out and I had to take breaks (meaning days and sometimes, weeks) at several points throughout the book before feeling compelled to continue reading.<br />Overuse of \\"proper\\" and \\"save for\\".<br />Non-linear storytelling which I found unnecessary, although some readers may find it clever.<br />A secondary storyline whose main character at times comes across as the entire novel's main character, causing some confusion as to whose story the novel is really about.<br />Victorian-era customs and protocol (at least those expected of \\"proper\\" folk) were completely ignored; characters behave more like modern-day individuals.<br />Vague characters meant to come across as mysterious, enigmatic, etc., only came across as under-developed.  The one (slight) exception being Mr. A. H./\\"the man in the grey suit\\" - one of the magicians.<br />The circus Clock defies logic, even when suspending belief for the sake of the story.<br />The story takes place in several locations in the U.S. and Europe, but you wouldn't know it if it weren't spelled out for you, as there are little to no descriptions (go figure) to distinguish these locations from each other.<br /><br />Moments I enjoyed:<br />The scene where the heroine auditions for the circus, especially the finale.<br />The Pool of Tears and a few other circus attractions.<br />The hero's reaction when he realizes who his \\"competitor\\" is.<br />The chemistry between the hero and his first love.<br />The moment the drunk, eccentric proprietor comes across information about the magic being used.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this novel if plot is not an issue to the reader.  There are some creative elements regarding the circus itself that are worth experiencing.  The movie version of this book will need to be heavily re-written, however.  For me, this was a decent three-star novel.ers behave more like modern-day individuals.<br />Vague characters meant to come across as mysterious, enigmatic, etc., only came across as under-developed.

B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Nice book, had a good time reading it.<br />But to me, it is not a very memorabele book or a book I woud read again.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I would score this as best one I have read so far on the series. You know book one makes you interested in the series, and book keeps you going, but this book is the one that will make you love the series. Amazing plots and unexpected outcomes will make you anxious for the next book. In the overall the series is great, so if your are willing to buy this book, you probably think the same as me so I can assure you won't be disappointed with this one!

B000002GI0|5.0|This is one of those albums that I repeat listening to during my commute. I am one of the old guys who consider the album a collective creation, not just a bunch of songs. This album is a wonderful piece of work.
B008B8DY2O|2.0|This book is far too long, the prose is convoluted, the philosophy pedestrian, the author is infatuated with his main character (himself), and the words fall like raindrops on the earthen canvas of my page, like drops of blood from my brow, and they kept on falling and falling a deluge of words, and so on... :-)<br />I gave it two stars for its potential has there been an editor and the Bombay scenery.<br />Unfortunately, I had to abandon reading when he reaches Goa.<br />This book (like The Road) proves once again that anybody can write a best seller.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It was a really good book! All about suspense, adventure, friendship, family, and LOVE! Cassia was the best in this book!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|We love this game. It is fun and relaxing. The game is appropriate for kids 5-85. My little  boy was surprised that I played it so long.
0156034026|3.0|I'd give this a five for product placement, three for English and one for veracity.<br /><br />It is well-calculated to appeal to liberals anxious to believe that Pakistan is full of people just like them.<br /><br />The writing style flows but it is phoney.  Someone with Changez' history wouldn't speak in that way.  His career change is utterly unmotivated - the love affair is thin and clichéd.<br /><br />The whole book has virtually no mention of Islam at all.  That in itself must make it totally false.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Simply incredible. The quality of the blue ray is amazing. I wanted the pack but it was too expensive. If you love The Lord of the rings you must have it in blueray
0679892478|5.0|Books are a must have for all children and this is a classic, glad it's now a board book too
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend to anyone looking for a romantic read! Second books are the best to read!
B000OVLINI|3.0|I found the story a bit slow and lacking a bit in character building.  I struggled to get through it and found it just okay.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Awesome app, is great at what it does. Very easy to use, and I like the fact that I can upload the documents to the service of my choice that I have installed on my PHONE.<br /><br />That's right, the description does say PHONE in it, so don't bash the developer because it is not for a tablet. How do you think it's going to scan a document without a camera? Read the review! The last line in the description says \\"Android PHONE\\", it's not the developers fault that you can't use the app because you don't have the right type of device that is clearly stated is needed.<br /><br />Also, this market is not \\"the kindle store\\", so don't downgrade the app because Amazon has apps for more than one type of device.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Such an interesting and heat-wrenching story that captures a time in American history I didn't know much about.  Christina Baker Kline wove a wonderful story through her endearing characters, while educating us on a little known process our country engaged in to place homeless children, and the intrinsic pitfalls that came along with it.  I especially like how the author connected generations through her characters.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|It is great and it plays great! I really enjoy listening to their music and am glad they put out another album.

B0084AXZK0|4.0|This was my first time reading Oscar Wilde and I absolutely loved it.  There was a small section in the middle that was a bit dry but the beginning and ending were so gripping and the content was so intellectually stimulating that it more than made up for that.  I definitely recommend this book to all types of readers.

B003G4W49C|3.0|I was expecting more from this book from what I have heard about it from others. I like the concept of the future that Card has built, but I feel like the book focused too much on describing each individual battle.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is the first and still only Nicolas Sparks novel I have read. From seeing his other books' movies, I expected this book to be too romantic for me to get through, which was not the case. I am not big into reading about love and romance, but this book wasn't that. It was ultimately a story about survival. I really enjoyed this book.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I ownly have this in tape,so I saw it online thought I should get it for my collection... and car.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|I am very impressed with the recreation of sound dynamics and added nuances in this classic. I really think Ace did a good lead part on the added sweet pain track. Nothing outstanding but pretty cool. My first complaint was the waiting time by ordering this over seas . The jewel case came broken so I replaced it with another.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Afichie has written a book that is both beautiful and full. Her observations on race and America (and Americans) is honest and real, and is worth an entire conversation of it's own. But the humanity and love in the book speaks beyond borders and race. It is a lovely, beautifully written book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great for those who can't own their own horse. It teaches you how to properly care for a horse as well as the responsibilities of having one. My only complaint is all of the advertisements pop up in the middle of events.
B002QFYJF4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Boogie Nights, There Will Be Blood, The Master, and even Punch-Drunk Love,<br />but this is Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece.<br />And Aimee Mann's soundtrack is beautiful.
0545128285|5.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard, was a bit of a disappointment to me. I expected a lot more depth from Rowling who normally gives excellent descriptions and lots of back story. However this book is a good simple read if you have a bored hour sometime in your weekend.<br /><br />Beedle himself was a muggle who seems to know a bit much about the magical world. His stories are true Aesop's Fable style with something to learn at the end, with extra commentary by Albus Dumbledore, it does become quite a fun read. Children between 7-10 will enjoy the book as the stories are short and easy to understand.<br /><br />The first of the five stories \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\" is a wizard tale of the golden rule. Do unto others as you would have done to you story. The wizard and his son have very different views on how to use their magic. The father believes in helping muggles (non magical people) with their every day problems. The son believes that using magic for muggles is useless due to the fact that wizards were obviously a superior race. In the end he changes his mind due to a deathbed curse from his father.<br /><br />\\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\" is Beedle's second story in the book. Here a group of people gather once a year to await who will be chosen to bathe in the fountain. The fountain then cures what ails you and generally makes your life much easier from then on. This particular year three witches and a knight are thrown in together due to circumstance. The three witches heal their ailments by the accomplishing tasks that come up on the trail to the fountain. In the end they let the knight bathe and it changes his life forever. But is the fountain really magical, or is it just a state of mind?<br /><br />\\"The Warlocks Hairy Heart\\", is a dark traumatic love story. By far my favorite of the five stories in the book. In this story the Warlock realizes his family and friends are becoming weak from loving each other. So he performs a dark magic ritual and hides his heart away out of his body and in a box. Years later he is the most successful and richest Warlock in the province. He overhears his servants pity him because no one loves him. He then decides to take a lady for his estate. Due to the fact he has no heart he woos the richest and most beautiful woman in the realm. She then figures he has no heart and when she convinces him to put the heart back in his chest, the heart is lonely and dark and even hairy from being locked up so many years. Back in the chest of the owner his insane heart and the dark desires from the heart overpower the mind just as he believed a heart can do and both the Warlock and the girl die tragically.<br /><br />\\"Babbity Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump\\" is a classic tale of power and trickery. The King in the story wants to harness all magical power for himself, and an Muggle tricks the King into taking magical lessons from him for a price. In the end the muggle is almost found out, but he locates a magical source in the palace, the wash woman Babbity Rabitty. He asks her to hide behind a tree and perform the magic the King commands for his court performance. The last spell the King tried was out of Babbity's magical range and the King is livid. The Muggle then blames Babbity and with transfiguration she tricks the court into letting her go.<br /><br />\\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\", and the last story in the book is full of Harry Potter references as the Elder Wand and the Invisibility Cloak. The Brothers try to cheat death and only one is smart enough to do that. Dumbledore's commentary on this last story is particularly interesting.<br /><br />I am a bit disappointed in the book but in the end it is a decent collection of short stories.heart away out of his body and in a box.

0316044695|5.0|This book is about valor, honor, dedication, determination and sacrifice.  It is a tribute to the U.S. Navy Seals as well as all  special operators in our military services and what they do for our country.  Marcus Luttrell does a magnificent in his first hand account of Operation Redwing and the events and training through out his life that prepared him for this mission.  This mission and the attempted rescue mission define extreme courage and teamwork even though the results were tragic.  I continue to  haunted by this story and the extreme loss that took place.  The author wanted those involved to be remembered and for me, they will be.  It would have been an honor to have met and shaken the hands of these men and to say thank you for what you did.
B00932A4XE|1.0|Lame movie. Thought it would be way funnier, unless you like somewhat depessing roles of women not being able to have children.

B00BEYYEE4|1.0|Stupid stupid stupid Twentieth Century Fox! This movie isn't worth buying let alone copying illegally. It refused to play on four different drives. When this happens, back it goes.

B0032CVAQQ|4.0|My boyfriend recommended this book (which is still a shock) and I<br />was expecting some gushy writing and such.  But I was surprised<br />at how it made sense and I found out so much about myself that<br />I didn't even realize.  When I discussed it with my boyfriend I<br />was also surprised to learn he hadn't even read the book!<br />Moving on!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved it! I can't tell you how many times I busted out laughing! I loved the man's view! It's  must read!!
B00A7KKPDK|3.0|I watch Ellen's show almost every day, and she keeps<br />promoting her book so I gave it a try.  It's good, reads<br />just like she was talking to you on her show.  But I<br />think the book is geared towards children too because<br />it has some silly moments here and there.  It's a good,<br />funny and positive read, but I did pass it on to co-workers<br />when I was done.

B00B5ARKDE|4.0|Not content to just be plain old building blocks, the LEGO brand has grabbed up licenses to create products based on everything from \\"Star Wars\\" to \\"Harry Potter\\" and competitors Marvel and DC Entertainment. What was once just a toy has transformed into an animated phenomenon that simultaneously lampoons and pays homage to the biggest franchises in pop culture.<br /><br />There have already been a couple LEGO \\"Star Wars\\" movies and a new TV show entitled \\"LEGO Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles.\\" Anyone who casually keeps up with the world of children's programming and toys knew it would only be a matter of time before the super hero industry got in on the LEGO animated action. DC Entertainment beat Marvel to the punch with \\"LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite.\\"<br /><br />In a plot to get himself elected president, Lex Luthor joins forces with the Joker to build a Black LEGO Destructor Ray and incite fear in the citizens of Gotham City and beyond. Batman reluctantly teams up with Superman to take on the destructive duo.<br /><br />Things get even more complicated when Two-Face, Harley Quinn, the Penguin, Catwoman, the Riddler, and Poison Ivy join the fight. Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and the rest of the Justice League storm into town to help the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel battle the super villains and stop their devious plan.<br /><br />\\"LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite\\" is the sort of self-referential entertainment that reaches out to both children and their parents. I can't necessarily say it's easy to sit through seventy minutes of this type of humor. However, it still provides some light chuckles and a few smiles. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out this is targeted at kids.<br /><br />The high-definition audio and video transfer for \\"LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite\\" will keep your child's attention. There are plenty of stimulating explosions and other exciting noises circulating through the 5.1 surround sound mix. Just like the comic books, the vibrant and contrasting colors will have their eyes glued to the screen.<br /><br />There are a few extra features which kids will enjoy. Their parents might find the bonus material more intriguing than the movie itself. \\"Building Batman\\" is a fifteen minute featurette consisting of DCU Lego Video Contest Grand Prize winner Garrett Barati taking us on a tour of his LEGO studio. He also provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the making of his Batman short film.<br /><br />We also get to see the top five contestants in \\"Winning Shorts: DCU Video Contest.\\" \\"LEGO Batman Jumps Into Action\\" is a promotional clip with some stop motion thrown in. Lastly, we get nearly seventy minutes of episodes from \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\\" and \\"Teen Titans\\" dragged out \\"From the DC Comics Vault.\\"<br /><br />You'll find \\"LEGO Batman: The Movie - Super Heroes Unite\\" will get a lot of repeat viewing from your children. Just like the LEGO \\"Star Wars\\" ones, my sons never seem to get enough of it. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a kid-friendly super hero gift that won't just get tossed to the side after one watch.ust like the comic books, the vibrant and contrasting colors will have their eyes glued to the screen.<br /><br />There are a few extra features which kids will enjoy.

B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|After a disappointing turnout in theaters for Arnold Schwarzenegger's first leading role in a film since 2003, \\"The Last Stand\\" has hit Blu-ray and DVD. It's a good thing we live in a day and age where movies get a second chance in a home entertainment environment. All the people who dismissed it the first time can see what they missed out on.<br /><br />Ex-LAPD officer Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has retired to the small border town of Sommerton Junction. He's taken the position of sheriff in the quiet community. Things get heated up when Ray discovers the leader of a drug cartel, Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega), is heading through the heart of Sommerton Junction as he speeds toward Mexico and freedom. It's up to Owens and his inexperienced deputies to stop Cortez and his gang as they prepare for a daring escape across the border.<br /><br />Frankly, \\"The Last Stand\\" is the perfect vehicle for Schwarzenegger to make his comeback in. it's not an overhyped blockbuster or giant summer action film like a new \\"Terminator\\" would be. It's a more personal and low-profile affair which basically has the actor playing himself. He's getting older but doesn't want to give up on the adrenaline rush of actively working and doing something physically challenging. Schwarzenegger is the type of guy that knows it's almost time to start winding down but fights it tooth and nail.<br /><br />If you spent the bulk of the past decade mourning the loss of the 1980s and 1990s action films you grew up on, \\"The Last Stand\\" will fill that void in your heart. It's packed with that good old-fashioned violence, blood, and gore the politically correct will run from in herds. This is classic Schwarzenegger wrapped up in a new package.<br /><br />The high-definition transfer for \\"The Last Stand\\" presents a crystal clear picture and great 7.1 surround sound. However, the clarity doesn't distract from the gritty quality of the movie. Every blast of a gun, explosion, and crunching sound of someone getting hit blares out at the audience.<br /><br />A nice amount of special features are included in the Blu-ray release of \\"The Last Stand.\\" There are three behind-the-scenes featurettes entitled \\"Not In My Town: Making 'The Last Stand', \\"Cornfield Chaos: Scene Breakdown,\\" and \\"The Dinkum Firearm & Historic Weaponry Museum Tour.\\" Deleted and extended scenes are also included. Johnny Knoxville and Jaimie Alexander provide first person \\"Actor-Cam Anarchy\\" as well.<br /><br />\\"The Last Stand\\" may not be an innovative action flick that will change the way we look at the genre. it never made any promises to do so. What it does do is put Arnold Schwarzenegger back where he belongs. He's back in power as the king of action heroes. The aging actor might need to retire sometime, but it's not today!ne getting hit blares out at the audience.<br /><br />A nice amount of special features are included in the Blu-ray release of \\"The Last Stand.\\" There are three behind-the-scenes featurettes entitled \\"Not In My Town: Making 'The Last Stand', \\"Cornfield Chaos: Scene Breakdown,\\" and \\"The Dinkum Firearm & Historic Weaponry Museum Tour.\\" Deleted and extended scenes are also included.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It captures the imagination like no other book! Good teen AND grown up fiction my son and I both read. Amazing!
B003F3FJQO|3.0|I liked this book a lot, but I definitely liked the first one better. It was too off paced, sometimes very fast and you had to catch on quickly, and other times lingering and leaning toward boring.<br /><br />I did like the addition of group B, although I would have liked to have them appear more (e.g, names, personalities etc.) I also liked the addition of Brenda, I kind of felt bad for Thomas the whole way through, at first having two girls like him and being confused, and then having neither of them like him and feeling betrayed.<br /><br />I do wish that the older characters had appeared more, like minho and newt, or that Thomas would have actually gotten to know the other gladers; I felt his neglection towards the boys who had be following him the whole way was very unsatisfying. I also would have liked to see a bit more of a leadership role from others; the book was so based around Thomas i felt the other characters were being ignored.<br /><br />Over all a good read, not too long and easy to comprehend. I'll read the next book and the prequel simply because I love this series so far! Definitely read if you enjoyed \\"the maze runner\\".

B003QSMC18|5.0|The Princess and the frog is one of Disney's questioned movie. Most people dislike the need for the shadow man, who tricks the Prince's butler into doing his will. Some people feel that the shadow man and &#34;his friends on the other side&#34; are not appropriate to be showing to children. That may be true for some children who would cry from very minor scares. I chose this rating because the shadow man is just another bad guy in another disney movie. It just shows that there ARE bad guys out there that are going to trick you and make your life harder than it is. I also chose this rating because Tiana teaches young people the value of hard work and &#34;that star is only going to get you part of the way&#34;. The Princess and the Frog is a great movie that I enjoy watching. I  love it all. I recommend this movie to all ages, but it would be great for children @ least 7-whatever age children are developing their own values. Talk to them about the meaning, parents.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|These stories are best read instead of films or tv as they give you the atmosphere of the times and you find out what happens to the various characters after the visual media finish. Nothing worse than sitting there wondering what happened to someone when the credits roll, read the book and you will find out.
B0002XMKYE|5.0|Gotta be honest and give the film its due:  this is one of my all-time favorites for sheer film-making competence and virtuoso actors, not to mention the score.  Dozens of you have said that much better and more specifically than I ever could, so I'll add a bit of nit-picking.<br /><br />Recommend \\"Making of Patton\\" 50-minute tv special for more details about the making of the film and Franklin Schaffner, director, for whom it's nominally a tribute.<br /><br />Errors in the closed captioning:<br />(a) Gen. *Bedell* Smith in its first two uses, with Patton on phone to Gen. Smith, is shown as \\"Bill\\" on the closed captioning.  Later uses are shown correctly.  Scott pronounces the name correctly, but quickly.<br />(b) first two references to the Normandy town *Caen* are pronounced correctly by George Scott but shown on the CC as \\"Cannes\\" -- which, IIRC, is on the Cote d'Azur and a good ways SE of Normandy;  third reference by Karl Malden is shown as \\"Cannes\\" also, but Malden mispronounces it that way.

B009NY43NY|1.0|The  anticipation  for  the  last  Sookie  book  was  high  until I  started  to  read  it. I  felt  as  though Harris hurried  the  ending  and  gave  up  on  Sookie and  the  series.  The  ending  was  highly  disappointing  and  not  what I  had  envisioned.
1599218011|3.0|After reading other reviews it was a gamble to order this since I have been reading multiple sources on juicing/smoothies/raw food etc.  I have to say I really find Kris compelling and her story is inspirational, there are good points and recipes but if you have a little knowledge on nutrition or health principles, this may not rock your world.  It will be a good book to lend to others wanting to make changes.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I've been using this app for about a month.  I use it now<br />- to keep the percentage charge in the notification bar,<br />- to graphically show the charge on the home screen (lotsa widget choices here),<br />- to graphically confirm when I'm charging,<br />- to warn me when charge is getting low, and occasionally<br />- to show me battery temperature and voltage.<br />Most of these options are individually configurable, but whether configured or not, the app works beautifully right out of the box.<br /><br />A number of screens identify time remaining for your favorite phone or tablet activities for the current charge level.  It defaults to general assumptions about usage, but you can also fine tune individual activity usage by &#34;calibrating&#34; your particular device from shared online data.<br /><br />What's not to like.  I tried about half a dozen battery apps over the last month and this was the easy winner.  The only function I can think of I might want that isn't in this app is a milliamp meter to monitor the charge rate.  But that's a minor quibble.  I definitely recommend this app for any android user wanting to monitor the battery.

B00AAQHP66|3.0|Inspired by the true story of surfing legends Frosty Hesson and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Jay Moriarity, this film at times is inspiring but the main reason to see it are some of the big surf (Mavericks) sequences shot north of L. A.<br /><br />Frosty (Gerard Butler) is an aging surfer who mostly neglects his wife and daughter.  If he's not working (repairs stuff), he's surfing with his buddies.  Living across the street is young Jay (Cooper Timberline then Jonny Weston) whose father leaves him and his alcoholic mother (Elisabeth Shue).  Eventually Frosty fills that role and agrees to mentor Jay so that he can ride the \\"Mavericks\\" that will eventually show up.  It's kind of like the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi in \\"The Karate Kid.\\"  All of the time is in training not surfing.  This includes writing long essays, but not about his crush on an older girl (Leven Rambin).<br /><br />Alas, the film is full of clich&eacute;s and has a boilerplate script.  But Weston is cute and Butler is hunky, so I suspect the film hit its target pretty well.  The PG rating keeps the potential bully violence and budding romance in check, and saves a downer for the epilog.  For me, I just liked the waves.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It's a fast read.  Many of Sookie's male harem  show up.  I don't like the ending because it's not an end.

But lo and behold,  Another one.  called 'What happen next&#34;&#34;  At least we didn't have to keep reading about Sookie taking a shower 50 times!
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this movie more out of curiosity than anything else. Many people I respect raved about it and I've heard people use parts of it as illustrations for real life political happenings. I felt it was truly an important part of our culture and that I would be lacking in understanding many remarks in normal conversation if I didn't watch this video. Now that I've seen it I see why it is so powerful and I really enjoyed it as well! Now I need to watch \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"
0060776757|5.0|This is a must own for both U2 fans or fans of music in general. Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton & Larry Mullen Jr all give an inside look at how U2 got started and all the big moments of their careers up to 2006 when the book was published. One of the biggest music acts in the world now, it is incredibly interesting to see how it all came together when they were in high school, and how their success just seemed to happen slowly and organically. It wasn't until their 3rd album, &#34;War&#34; that they began to take off, and with the help of &#34;Under a Blood Red Sky&#34;, started their rise as a top Live act. Get the book though to read the whole story, its a good one. And the book is well presented with lots of pictures, as well as chapters that fit the theme of the albums. (Example, &#34;How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb&#34; era uses the red & black stripes/circles found on the album cover and booklet).
B001974DG0|5.0|This was the first Dean Koontz book I read many years ago and was the start of my love for most all of Dean Koontz's books. He has the ability to write deeply riveting fiction that is just a very minute leap from reality, skirting the edges of our dreams and fears.<br />This story of the love shared between humans and dogs and each other with a taste of the future research of recombinant DNA is fantastic! Well worth reading again in digital form, a true keeper.

0307950654|2.0|This book was selected (without my vote) by my book club. I decided to read it even though I had serious reservations about it. While I found the mystery part of this story somewhat entertaining and surprising, I completely disliked the fact that P D James used the background and beloved characters from iconic Jane Austen novels.. If the characters had been original I would have given this book a much better review.. As it is, James without conscience changed the basic, characteristics of Elizabeth, Darcy, Colonel Fitzwilliam and others to fit her dreary plot - which lacked any wit, humor or charm. Does this very successful writer really need to cash in on someone else's superior imagination to further her career? Just write mysteries, Ms. James, and leave Jane Austen untouched on her pedastal, where she belongs.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Simply incredible.  Ms. Morton is an amazing story-teller.  I have read all of her novels and couldn't wait to devour this one.  She never disappoints.

B00847KFDS|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. It's perfect for the sunny summer. I get such a big smile on my face listening to this. Fogerty picked some of his best songs from his Creedence days and for sure his solo years. Hot Rod Heart was always my favorite song on Blue Moon Swamp and he just kicks it into high gear with Brad Paisley. Almost Saturday Night will be a bonafide country hit. My favorite CCR song, Have You Ever Seen the Rain, feels like it was written FOR Alan Jackson. He fits so well with John's arrangement and vocals. And I didn't know who this band Dawes was but their voices work so well with John. Someday Never Comes sounds fantastic. The whole album just gets better and better with every listen. I seriously recommend this to anyone who wants to hear real music. I can't wait to see what Fogerty does next. I need to catch him on tour!

B0054R6BFM|5.0|This has got to be one of the best books I've ever read. Thirteen Reasons Why tells a compelling story about Hannah, and girl who committed suicide, and thirteen reasons that pushed her to the edge.<br />When I read the synopsis I literally got goosebumps. The cover alone gives me chills. I wanted to read it but at the same time I was worried it might be too disturbing. I was wrong. I enjoyed every page, I read with such speed because I couldn't get enough. I had to know why Hannah killed herself. And I had to know Clay's role in it.<br />I don't even know how to begin this review because there are no words to describe how amazing this book is (\\"no words\\" and yet here I am reviewing it).<br /><br />It's my first time to read a book written this way. It was interesting to read Hannah's story told through the tapes Clay listens to. It painted a clear picture of Hannah without her actually being present in the book. Everything happened in one day on Clay's end but on Hannah's, it involved a series of events that took place in a long span of time. Reading  the past (the tapes) intertwined with the present (Clay's thoughts and narration) created a beautiful effect that really brought the story to life. It made me feel how painful it was for Clay to listen to those tapes and feeling so useless because he wasn't able to do anything to stop Hannah from killing herself. Clay talking to Hannah's recorded voice was one of the most painful things for me. I cried with Clay and I felt Hannah's pain.<br />There's no other way for me to review this book without giving anything off because to discuss the events that took place in the book or the characters involved would equate to spoiling it. So I'll just say this: this is a must read. This book showed how our actions, even the seemingly meaningless ones, can make or break someone else without us even knowing it. More importantly, it could help shed light on one of the most pressing issues around the globe - suicide. The book's a work fiction but at the end of it all, it left me thinking this could happen in real life. Jay Asher's storytelling really pulled me in. Thirteen Reasons Why is a highly compelling story that you shouldn't miss out on.ork fiction but at the end of it all, it left me thinking this could happen in real life.

193700788X|1.0|Like many other readers I was so disappointed in this book. I felt like  Charlaine Harris' interest in the series died a few books back and in a desperate attempt to be rid of the whole thing she wrote this miserable excuse for an ending. Why she didn't just post on her website &#34;she ends up with Sam&#34; and be done with it I don't know. Right up to the very end I kept hoping that Eric would appear and sweep her off her feet. Big waste of time and money. :-(
B00BCV3HGU|1.0|I am numbed by this release. It's funny to me that you can search music on amazon, type will i am, and it actually leads you to results. They need to develop a tab for \\"anti-music\\" and have your search engine lead you to will i am, pitbull, kesha, and on and on. I watch a lot of basketball to see which players have been influenced by my game. The playoffs are a great showcase for my influence, especially the fancy layups that I should have patented. Before many games, I hear something about \\"the power\\" by will i am. I thought the Britney Spears debacle with this guy was bad, but it is as if he wanted to move on to the next round of the crap playoffs. He has a track in \\"the power\\" that may be unbeatable, even by pitbull. There is not anything redeeming about this \\"music\\". It is overproduced backing tracks with the worst lyric content this side of a black eyed peas album. As bad as black eyed peas are, and they are really bad, I think will sat down with the group and said they were not doing enough to destroy music. He told them he had to get out on his own, spread his wings, explore the space and realllly destroy music as we know it. I have two daughters that make fun of how bad this \\"music\\" is when they hear it on tv. I use it as an example of what happens when we let people like this keep recording. We then listen to some Beatles music and some REM to get them back on track.<br /><br />Hearing this makes me prouder than ever that I front a true band in Asschowder. We are masters of the trade. All of us in the band don't just play instruments, we set new standards how those instruments sound. I'm the frontman and it's hard for anyone but me to describe me. I have an incredible voice, am flexible enough to make up new dance moves on stage and can grill a great steak. You aren't going to find that in the top 40. You are going to find it live on stage as we tour food additive tradeshows all around the United States. We get the crowd going, hook up with groupies and run2.7 miles every show. The best thing about us is that we aren't will i am. We make fun of him in our black eyed peas medley we call \\"10 minutes of terrible music\\".

193700788X|3.0|[[ASIN:193700788X Dead Ever After: A Sookie Stackhouse Novel (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)]]<br /><br />Having been a Sookie fan for many, many years now (since before there was even a True Blood show to draw in attention); I eagerly awaited this final installment of her story.  Even with seeing the poor reviews \\"Dead Ever After\\" was getting, I still just HAD to read it and HAD to see how Charlaine Harris wrapped up the story line of a character I have invested a great deal of time into getting to know.<br /><br />  Was I disappointed?  Slightly, yes.  This book didn't have the same feel as the other books in the series.  Others have mentioned thinking this book was written by a ghost-writer, and having read it, I can kind of see why! The Eric in this book was not the man (Vampire) that we have grown to love.  He was completely out of character.  People (beings) who had been minor characters in previous stories were suddenly the stars of this book, while the ones we truly cared to see were stuck on the sidelines and barely mentioned.<br /><br />I know finishing a series is always hard. And in this case, there was absolutely no way for Ms. Harris to make every fan happy.  But I find myself wishing for a more definitive ending for Sookie, or even an epilogue that would have tied things up better.
0345803493|3.0|Just had to complete the entire series once book one was completed.  Enjoyed book three more than two, but alot of background was established in book two.
B00CHILW64|5.0|We thought this movie was excellent.  The acting, special effects and story were incredible.  The Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are just outstanding in their roles but the actors who portrayed their children were so believable, you could not help but feel the full emotion of this story.  The movie makes you think of the possibility of something tragic changing everything in an instant, how circumstances can give us strength we didn't know we had, and how the best in us can be brought out.  Bring lots of tissues.  The scene where McGregor breaks down on the phone is one of many that will have you crying.
0345803507|5.0|Was glad to see there was such a happy ending.  Too many sex details even though all the the 50 shades were like that
159463176X|5.0|I originally read The Kite Runner as a means to have something to talk about with a girl I met at church, Jess.  She was beautiful, and she had qualities that attracted me to her beyond any other attraction that I have ever felt. It was her intensity and passion, coupled with a charming quirkiness and a distant, but thoughtful, nature. She was kind and loved to laugh. I was mesmerized. I made it a point to speak with her at every opportunity.  She told me I should read The Kite Runner. I did, or at least listened to the audio version while at work (where I have endless time to listen to literature, music, sermons, etc.). I was spellbound by Khaled Hosseini's ability to conjure up emotion in his readers. I read through (and experienced) moments of intense pain balanced by moments of purist delight and joy.  I had never smiled so genuinely at the slightest expressions of affection or felt so deeply moved by the painful circumstances occurring in the lives of literary characters.  I don't think I am stretching too far to say that I felt emotions that I never knew I possessed. Hosseini was real in a way that I had not encountered \\"real\\" before. He challenged me, and he presented the history of Afghanistan through fiction in a way that intrigued me about its reality. And these were the things that I discussed with Jess.<br /><br />I proposed to her on March 15th of this year. We are to be married in five months.  She gave me the audio version of And the Mountains Echoed for my 32 birthday.  I just finished listening.  One word comes to mind; bravo.<br /><br />ATME is, in a way, a collection of short stories all centering on the relationship between a brother and sister, the two torn apart by desperation.  It is not my intention to delve into the many plot lines.  You will read them.  And you will read the many moving themes and the familiar and tragic qualities of human relationships.  And you will encounter Hosseini's wonderfully crafted imagery, his attention to detailand subtle nuance, his expertly realized characters and his complex and inspired dialogue. And you will even be impressed with his ability to write gripping folk-lore. Each story is rich and compelling, bearing little resemblance to the others, perfectly capable of existing on its own. I think that Hosseini is saying--not only about the characters in the book but about all people--essentially this: each person has an interesting story to tell, and no life is unimportant.<br /><br />As I journeyed through the novel, I found myself compelled and inspired to change.  To change my non-committal nature, to stick with my promises, to reach out to the people in my life, to care, to hope, to fight for things I believe in.  I am inspired to write!  To live well.  To love well. To make an impact.  To explore.  Hosseini connects with me so well that I feel like we have met.  He is a personable author, and if it is possible to know the character of a man based on his writing, I would say he is a kind and caring soul who values truth, compassion and integrity.<br /><br />It would be hazardously incorrect to say that my relationship with Jess is based around our shared love for Hosseini's writing.  There is so much that we love about each other. Life is so rich when we are together and we want to experience the world.  No, our love for each other is not based off of his books, but he did make an impact.  And that is what this story is about, the impact that we have on the lives of others; the resonating echoes.  In ATME, Hosseini urges his readers to confront the reality that, for good or evil, our actions affect the lives that surround us.<br /><br />Each person has an interesting story to tell, and no life is unimportant.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is truly one of the best games I have ever played and its mobile so I can take it on the go if I'm in for a long car ride!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app (which I got for free) helps me sleep at night. There isn't anything else that I can ask for (at the moment, at least)!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I don't own a lot of movies as I don't really care to see many things twice.  But I have enjoyed these movies immensely and recommend them to any who love action movies!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Now they came up with a second one when I didn't even like the first one. I still hate this. It's useless.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've enjoyed the size and clarity of the tiles. There are times it freezes and I have to press hint before it will move forward. I still would recommend this app.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Why is this on a kindle for free if we don't need it? I don't get it . It dosen't even show the definitions.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked it. I think this one is my favorite of all the books in the hunger games trilogy. Awesome!
B009AP2G26|5.0|I loved it. There was a few inconsistencies like what happened to Sugar and Joe (the one with the dreads?) towards the end.
B00BU18U82|4.0|Do you think it is the same? But is is a lot different, I wish it is the same as the farming simulator 2013 on the computer
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|This album was really good. I have one of there other albums and I like this one a bit more.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|When I first heard this game, I didn't think I like it.<br /><br />NOW I'm hooked on the darn thing, and am coming up with different ways to kill people with just a simple bacteria. xD
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family.  My Granddaughter and I have watched it over and over.  Heartwarmingly funny
B000VBJEEG|3.0|I would give this movie a higher rating but in the middle of movie it skips a lot. I really enjoy this movie and I'm not, not happy, but just wanted to let y'all know. Thank you.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Enjoyed this third book in the series and looking forward to the next one!  Love the characters and also loathe some of them, which is what makes the story so good!
B00821OX98|2.0|A wonderful story line however I didn't feel drawn in, I think perhaps a lacked depth.  It's unfortunate because I really did want to like it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched what I thought would be one show on Netflix then got addicted to it! Love the action packed show and especially love that it's not cheesy like most zombie shows. Great job on Walking Dead series :)
B003B02O7I|5.0|In this book John Grisham exceeds his usual high level of storytelling.  The opening chapters offer a grim cast of characters, the totally dysfunctional family of billionaire Troy Phelan.  But don't quit!  After the early pages, the story gets interesting -- a tale of personal redemption and amazing self-sacrifice.  It's set mostly in the fascinating but little known area of southwest Brazil known as the Pantanal.  Even if you've never been near this part of the world, you'll be amazed at its vastness and beauty.  This is a marvelous, heartwarming read.
0446581348|5.0|I freaking loved this book the first time I saw it. It was just so colorful and well laid out in terms of context. The content was very helpful, i think it would help alot of aspiring makeup artists and beginners. I feel this would even be a good book to read in your free time! Good job BB &#60;3
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson did a great job bringing the story of The Wheel of Time to a great conclusion. I am very pleased with how he tied all the story lines together and finished the legacy of Robert Jordan. As a fan of the series, thank you for finishing the story.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|For years, I thought this score was completely forgettable (except for \\"Professor Umbridge,\\" that is).  The fact that this is my least favorite of the movies didn't help.  What changed?  Bizarrely, the culprit is LEGO Harry Potter.  In the game, the tracks are edited and looped, so if you're playing a level, you will literally hear one of these tracks played dozens of times.  I kept getting the tracks stuck in my head and thinking, \\"This can't be a Hooper track, can it?\\" because I had previously found his soundtracks so bland and forgettable.  I pulled out the soundtrack again today and, lo and behold, I now enjoy a substantial amount of it... albeit because of the game, not the movie.<br /><br />I think Hooper's style is just too subtle and minimalistic for the big screen.  I've actually always been a fan of \\"Professor Umbridge,\\" which is one of the only tracks that lives up to its potential.  It's not fun to listen to, per se, but it's not supposed to be.  It's appropriately cutesy on the surface, but rather grating and irritating as well, as Umbridge should be.  I think it's one of the better written character themes in the series.  It's memorably irritating.<br /><br />Tracks I grew to enjoy include \\"Another Story,\\" \\"Dumbledore's Army,\\" and \\"The Room of Requirement.\\"  Maybe they were just the ones played the most in LEGO Harry Potter...  But I don't think that's the whole story.  \\"Another Story\\" makes for a very atmospheric opener (to the film, that is; the soundtrack is out of order), and \\"The Room of Requirement\\" is appropriately whimsical.  It's actually used for the montage in the film which features the students in the Room of Requirement contrasted with humorous scenes of Filch trying to figure out what they're up to, and I think it works well for that.  Hooper does whimsy and humor well, but his score never reaches the dramatic crescendos it should have.  Therein lies the problem.<br /><br />In the end, I can now see Hooper's talent, but he's mismatched with this series.  The music is too minimalistic for a film of this heft.  I'm glad they brought in Alexandre Desplat for the final films, though this score has its appeal if you listen to it enough (or play LEGO Harry Potter for hours and hours...).
B006CBSE86|5.0|No...seriously. Just buy, do it now! No, stop reading this. GO BUY IT! It's perfection. One of the best in the genre.
193700788X|5.0|Charlaine did an amazing job bringing this series to a close. I am saddedned that it is over. I love how she managed to bring some of the major characters were grew to love, that hadn't previously died, back!  I would have liked to see Bubba though!
B0086449YA|5.0|There really isn't a need for me to write a length in depth review about the latest Mark Knophler music. I purposely didn't read the reviews before I bought the CD because I knew it would be musical excellence once again.<br /><br />Mark is one of the most unappreciated musician of our time. Shame. Not sure if I will like this more than Shangrilah ,Get Lucky, or Sailing to Philadelphia, but at least I can listen to all of Knophler's cd's in a row and not feel artist burnout.<br /><br />He truly can capture any genre and pay it his respect.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I only gave it four stars because of my own selfishness, I wanted so badly for Abdullah to recognize Pari !!!! But the folk tale at the beginning was a beautiful insight of what to come in the end. Beautiful.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent trilogy - first book is by far the best, then they decrease somewhat in quality thereafter, but still awesome page-turners!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read this book at least 4 times. Each and every time I read it I am drawn into the world of Fifty Shades!
