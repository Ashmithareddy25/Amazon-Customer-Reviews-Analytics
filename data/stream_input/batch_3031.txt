B00FWLDHSY|3.0|I can see how this movie would appeal to video game players. Very loud and very violent. Effects are well done.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It could have more things free, and fix bugs. But otherwise it is a very interesting app, kinda reminds me of temple run and subway surfer combined. Very fun app.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love this game!! My only gripe is that I cant play the same save as is on my iphone :/ But otherwise I like that I only need to be on the game for a few minutes each day and the game does the rest :)

B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books get better and better ! I can't wait to read the last and final installment of this series!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Well it easier and you don't have to spend real<br /> money for characters  I think there can be more improvement on the app. such as customisable characters  or tag team matches<br /> that's just my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is meth in game form. And not chili P, I'm talking the blue stuff.The first few times you play, it's easy, no problem, feels pretty good. Then you play a little more each day, and you find that what once satiated your desire to kill some time and feel like a savvy intellectual is now no longer filled by that need. So you play a little more, each level harder than the next, so that each new level passed is a more exhilarating high........ then you find that the good stuff , the stuff that will take your game to a higher meaning of awesomeness, is cleverly offered to you by your sneaky dealer (er, mean the fine people at king.com) ...... for a price, of course. Yes, this game could lead to certain demise, but boy does it feel good to play!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a very intuitive app that works well and does what it say it will. HD pictures and videos, easy to use, with a few bells and whistles. Works well for me and what I needed it for.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Thor, by itself, is an excellent film.  It follows the comic theme with the right amount of 'artistic license' applied.<br />Anyone familiar with the comics knows the backstory but this really holds its own in preparation for 'The Avengers'.<br /><br />Coupling this with Captain America: The First Avenger does, what i believe was the intent, a superb job at setting the stage for The Avengers.<br /><br />The casting is excellent.  A serious Top-Shelf group of actors and actresses cast excellently in their respective roles.<br />This film is a keeper in my book.
B004132I20|5.0|Sherlock is a great series! In full disclosure, there is only 3 episodes per season, but they are each 90 minutes long with no commercials, It's more like getting 3 movies. The writing is sharp and the acting wonderful. I usually can guess &#34;whodunit&#34; in most crime shows as soon as the suspect shows up, but these shows don't follow the typical formula in American crime shows.
0131103628|3.0|The content of the book is very well done.  No doubt about that.<br /><br />I purchased this to replace my original copy which had been lost over the years.  (I've been developing with C since 1983.)<br /><br />The extra content is nice to have.<br /><br />If I have a complaint it's that the printing quality suffered.  It appears the printer did not properly take recycled paper into consideration when deciding which ink to use.  Print quality suffers as a result.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's good to have it back in my library.  It's been a while since I needed to use some of C's exotic features but I was quickly able to find the reference and syntax in the book..<br /><br />This is definitely one of those reference books to keep handly on the shelf but in front of your other exotic language references (Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, APL, etc) haha
B00C5ZNUCS|3.0|This album is ok, but nothing special.  I like the themes, but it just isn't my type of metal.  I do enjoy listening to it occasionally.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It took a little to get used to but after that I really liked it and couldn't put it down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it nothing to say that is negative. This game makez you think without noticing and make those gears work in your mind.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed following up on the trials Danny experienced after such a traumatic childhood event at the Overlook. The novel definitely had intensity that kept me reading well past my bedtime.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Happy it finally came out on kindle! It is an addictive, fun and sometimes frustrating game! I like playing on kindle more than my laptop!
0385732554|4.0|The Giver<br />Lois Lowry<br />Age Range: 8 - 12 years<br />Grade Level: 3 - 7<br />Paperback: 208 pages<br />Publisher: Ember; FIRST DELACORTE PRESS EDITION edition (January 24, 2006)<br />Language: English<br />ISBN-10: 0385732554<br />ISBN-13: 978-0385732550<br /><br />This review is also available on Get Kids to Read: [...]<br /><br />The Giver by Lois Lowry is the Newbery Award winning classic from the early 1990's. It's an excellent example of a well written dystopian novel. With the popularity of the genre peaking with titles such as The Darkest Minds, Divergent, and The Hunger Games I wanted to return to this classic which I had first read over twenty years ago.<br /><br />Jonas lives in a world that seems perfect. There is no pain, feelings or colors in the community he lives in. Everyone is assigned a job. There are no choices. When Jonas turns twelve, he is assigned the job of Receiver. This means he must bare the burden of the memories of pain and pleasure that the Giver holds.<br /><br />Lowry writes a vivid depiction of a society that has let go of everything that makes each person an individual in exchange for a sameness that is more comfortable. Readers will feel the pain as Jonas feels pain and will root for Jonas as he makes a decision that will change the community forever.<br /><br />This is the perfect book to put in the hands of fans of the Dystopian genre.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I can hardly believe that this book was written in 1985. The use of technology is so cool. The storyline is also quite gripping.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|The director has spun up an incredibly (if sadly) believable series of scenes. The very final scene pisses away all plausibility in a few seconds of runtime. I will not spoil the end here, except to say that an incredible coincidence comes out of nowhere. The creator clearly intends to make a poignant metaphor. Instead, it hits like a freshman short story writer with a baseball bat.<br /><br />The remainder of the film is understated and tense. The first third could be called lagging. Someone has advised not to allow the slightest hint of financial explanation. The scenes in which the predicament is discussed by a growing number of executives feel false. There is some throwaway trader jargon intended to provide authenticity without boring people who do not follow markets. When CEO character finally appears, his job is to play Doctor Watson. &#34;Explain it to me as if I was a small child or a golden retriever.&#34; Really? The CEO would deliver that stock line? The function could not have been performed by any number of junior traders that crowd the movie?<br /><br />The Brooklyn Bridge crossing scene is the opposite. It reads authentically, carried by Paul Bettany.<br /><br />All told, the movie held my attention. It avoided the excesses of 1987's Wall Street (The Gordon Gecko echo). I wanted it to be great. Who knows? Some re-editing, and extra footage might bring it up a notch. Regardless, they absolutely must bury that final scene.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|I like the game a lot but frustrated at not  always getting a download.Keep getting message about unable to download,try later.
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|Was good to read the book, after having seen the movie and missed a lot of the meaning. Wish I had read the books first.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I feel this book tries to bring out the positive side out of you. The principles are simple and well explained and is something that you can apply in your life. Definitely worth reading!!
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|I really enjoyed the first three books. The last two were ok, but somehow the story does not seem finished...
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|The album came within 6 days of ordering it. Completely worth it. The songs are amazing, I listen to the album every day(:
B001KS0THU|5.0|One of John Wayne's best, a must for any collrction. I watch it again and again. A definant keeper on the DVR file. Always enjoyable, I love it!
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|fun to watch!! packed with laughs and surprises. PERFECT !! Need more movies like this. Theres a lesson to be learned  &#34;never judge a book by it&#34;s cover&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cute. It's so addicting can't put it down wonderful to play and so funny . I love it thanks so much it's a joy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game when you're tryna kill some time!  Don't get hooked this game can be addictive once you get into the higher levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a different story; couldn't put it down.  While not the most uplifting book, such a great read and a book written with powerful emotion. Loved it.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|\\"Everything... affects everything\\"  was a phrase that stayed with me from this book.  Very moving, emotional, and leaves hope in ourselves, highly recommend for young to older readers!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Got this book as the deal of the day/week as the description sounded interesting.  So glad I took a chance on this book.  I loved the historical fiction about a subject I knew very little about.  I did love the older character's story much better than the young girl's, but overall still really liked the book.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Was initially happy to find this game FINALLY available for the kindle.. not so much pleased with the constant need to purchase helps to finish a level, and now the game is incredibly slow and bombs out.<br />I've tried reloading, but doesn't help at all.<br />Very disappointed.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, especially Pi's involvement with the different religions.  It makes you think. Some of the circumstances were pretty unbelievable but that isn't the purpose of the book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is my first Grisham novel, as he is not in the genre I usually read. I liked the premise of this book, and it was easy to read. I thought there'd be a segue between the first part and then the solving part, but there was none. We were cruising along and then, all of a sudden, we're talking about some new guy and taking a whole new spin.<br /><br />Besides the 180 in the middle of the book, I enjoyed reading it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I liked the the adventure and the raw, honest emotion as Cheryl made her way on the PCT,  with stunning descriptions,<br />This is a book for anyone who has lost their mother at a tender age or anyone who yearns to be in nature,
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|But would you know it I'm over my addition to the game now. NEXT think I'll check out this bingo that looks like fun now
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love watching these on my iPad.......for free:) just found out how to add the watch now feature! It's a lovely story, highly recommend this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love this game. I'm so glad that it finally became available for the kindle. Some levels are very challenging and test your patients, but feels good when you beat it!
B00AHG9KYE|3.0|What can I say? 2001 was ground-breaking, this is more like a conventional sci-fi read. OK but not great. Arthur C Clarke is still one of the best.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|This app is lots of fun!! I love the interactive games like this.  Could play this game all day everyday.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I loved the alternative points of view in this story.  The book is well-written in plain language; and the story is captivating, easy to follow, complex, meaty, and encouraging.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I like this game a lot I mean I played it on my friends phone and it was freaking amazing and I just want to download it but it wont and it SUCKS
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This was a very entertaining show. Well done. I will watch it again when it comes out for a new season. Are they going to have a new season in 2014?
B005T87QCI|4.0|My sons and I loved the movie and now we love the game. The game has great graphics and I like the different playing options.
1416914285|4.0|I had always heard many positive things about these series. Finally after watching the movie I got a chance to finally read this book. And it was so good I finished it in two days. It contains a mixture of all these different genres, and making the characters come to life. The author did a wonderful job getting the reader incorporated and making them feel their right their with the characters, and a part of their lives. Even though this book was terrific in every way and manner, the ending brought a shocking event and a bit of a cliffhanger, which is why the book has been given a 4 star. Also the movie just came out a couple of months ago, and have to say it is one of the best movie from a book made. This book contains the genre of adventure, action, romance, humor, and sarcasm. It can seem to relate to anyone in however their life is. It's a really good read for time to pass especially for young adults.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|After reading the book, I hoped that the movie was just as good. It was, to my surprise, for it being a romantic-like film, or a chick flick as most would call it. I enjoyed it. I am not one for chick flicks, but this one truly gave me another perspective that it is not a typical chick flick!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good challenge...wish there were more levels.<br />Good puzzles for average game. Makes you be a bit creative with solutions to game.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Yes, I seen the one with Kevin Costner, liked it! But when you have Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, you cannot deny that it will be epic! It is and I love it! Cheers to them both!
B009PMEEY2|5.0|This is a great game.  Love the pictures and the relaxing music.  Not hard to get the gist of the game and figure out how to play.
B006PE6VW6|1.0|It was an good movie because actors acted the part but unfortunately it portraits sex as simple casual & cheap encounters without any regards to morals or psychological consequences. When we got it we did not preview it to know what it was about (our bad).
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Good advice and how-to guide for the first time Kindle publisher.  Answers all the basic questions in a straight forward manner.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Waiting on Season 3, this is one great series to sit and watch, life in a simpler time. Would love to have lived in this timeframe.
1250038820|5.0|This is a beautiful book. Brandon's story of how the book came to be, and the contents themselves are beautiful. As a New Yorker no longer living there, the book takes me back home. From one page to the next, you can laugh and cry (my first big emotion reading the book was cry, following quickly by laugh, it's nice not knowing what to expecting one page to the next). The HONY page on FB is one of the few reasons I still check my newsfeed. But to feel the book in hand, tangible, is more powerful. There is tremendous inspiration in Brandon's journey. &#34;Humans of...&#34; are launching all over the world! Well done.
B008JAGZDE|2.0|Should have stopped with the last one, you can only remake a film so many times before you bomb out with it.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Jean Valjean is sporadically hunted by Javert after he breaks parole in 19th century France.  Jean Valjean also seeks redemption.  There's also brief, but only partially explained/detailed, episodes involving the conflict/riots of the people.<br /><br />The special effects are good.<br /><br />Acting on its own merits, without taking the singing into account, for all of the actors is well performed.<br /><br />Most of the actors are able to sing well to very well.  Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are surprising if you haven't heard them before.  Russell Crowe, unfortunately, is not cast well nor is he a very good singer.  This brought the entire movie down for me.<br /><br />However, overall, an adequate film.
B0088TG252|5.0|Denzel is awesome in this action flick, great movie, good story line and probably true if the truth was known.
1594744769|3.0|My book club chose this book because of its novel approach -- using found vintage photos to build a story on. It's definitely more a book for young people, as it's billed, I believe. The characters, for the most part, are shallow, one-trait depictions. The adults, of course, for the most part are missing, out of it, or villainous. At times the story felt like the author threw in an episode just to use a particular photo he liked. It does have violence and dark subject matter, which might not be suitable for some young readers. But all in all, I think they might like it. It's got an adventure and 'peculiar' characters.
B009G41CG2|2.0|I love all the unique lay outs, but there are no hints.  I know this is cheating but I don't have all day looking for that one match.  I want to know how many matches are left and a hint button.  If I could have everything, a shuffle would be nice, but not mandatory.  I have looked at every majong game out there and this could be my favorite.. with those changes.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game! Very classic yet modern. This is a good family game. I highly recommended downloading. Best of all its free
B000QCS8TW|3.0|If you watch the show then you will be missing out on the main points unless you get the dvd extended version.  The book explains every little bit of detail from the characters chainmail to what they say and think making it exhaustingly long in the long run.  He describes way to much, it is more of a 2.98 but I rounded off to a 3 because there are some very good parts that are not in the show on the regular season that are in the book.  Again though some parts move slow, some parts move fast, and then some parts just drag on and on so when you finally read something again you're used to the slow pace and are like what the hell.  He's a good author but needs to pick up the pace on the slow parts and not describe as many parts as he does.  Other then that its worth a read if you have the patience and time.  Later my peeps! Jokester J out.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband,s secret was my favorite summer read.  The  characters were relatable, and I must confess that the ending was a surprise to me
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Me and my husband like this album very much we are very big fans of Alter Bridge. We have all there albums and there all good.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This game is fabulous and a good way to learn how to play pool and it'll keep u entertained for hours on end
0425166805|5.0|The author offers a possible solution where the experts, scientists, historians failed. It is ridiculous to believe we are the only intelligent creatures in the Universe and our evolution is based only by our own forces.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I liked the book. I read Wayward first not realizing this  was a series. So for me this was filling in the blanks and was still a fun and exciting read.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Pretty good. I hold Grisham to a high standard because he is capable of it. Some great some good. This one good.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Not too bad, wasn't expecting much based upon reviews. But I like SciFi movies so watched it anyway. So I would recommend it to anyone who like that genre of movies.
1579129129|5.0|What an amazing collection of skulls!  It is so interesting to see how form follows function in this beautiful collection of the most minimal of our bodies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't like it at first but now I love it thanks so much Amazon MY MOM AND SISTER LIKE IT MY GRANDMOTHER AND OF COURSE YOU AND ME. ;) &quot;;)  super
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I forgot how much I love this movie! So many great cameos by famous people.....you must show this to your kids. It's a classic.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Thoroughly love this show.  The writing and acting are great.  Looking forward to watching all of the seasons,  Simply put the Good Wife is GOOD
6305428042|5.0|This movie was my childhood. Classic. You really can't go wrong. Every kid (and adult) should see this if you haven't already. You really can't go wrong.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun and I enjoy it a lot. I play it all the time now that I have it. If you don't have it get it.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|For those with some knowledge of classical English literature, the character of Van Helsing should bring to mind the Dracula novel.  In this film, Van Helsing is transformed into a tough, macho, hero adept at various weapons along with hand to hand combat.  His task is to hunt down and capture the various supernatural creatures that can prey on man; like the werewolf and vampires.  The movie starts with a prelude featuring the brides of Dracula trying to capture Frankenstein's monster.  The film then speeds forward to the day our hero is dispatched by the Vatican to hunt down Dracula.  The film then zig-zags across Europe as our hero and his sidekick meet up with Anna, played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale in a role all too similar to her role in the Underworld Trilogy.  Together they go to Dracula's castle where they dispatch him and his offspring in a climatic battle.  Though rated as a horror movie, there is nothing really scary as the film proceeds more like a gory action film with a little fantasy and a lot of suspense mixed in.  Hugh Jackman, fresh of his X-men role, fits perfectly into the role of Van Helsing.  The special effects of the film were quite good as all the monsters seemed very real.  The cinematography was quite beautiful, with awesome shots of various European cities and the countryside.  All in all, a good action film to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love, love, love Candy Crush. I have it on my Kindle Fire and on my phone. I can't get enough it is so addictive. Get Candy Crush you won't regret it!!
1601251505|5.0|This is 'the book' that you will need if you are going to be playing Pathfinder.  From starting your character to advanced combat.  This one book has it all.  Playing with a group of friends, I find that we all use the book throughout our gaming session.  The layout is fairly standard for RPGs.  The artwork is strong and consistent with Pathfinders overall styling.
1594202273|5.0|Command and Control is incredibly researched and written, deeply moving, thought provoking, conceptually brilliant, and a culturally much needed book on an often overlooked but globally scary problem.  It is a page turner and I had trouble setting it down.  Read it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Seiko 5 is one of the greatest  buy no matter what, please we will love to know if we can buy new canvas strap because it deteriorate fast I can thought
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is a great book for people who like mystery and suspense.  This is a very good book that will keep you on the edge of your seat
B000RLHDUM|5.0|The story and the wonderful actors made this movie great to watch.  The story and the action between the actors kept you watching every minute. I highly recommend.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|A quick, easy read. Brooks does a nice job writing from the perspective of multiple characters, connecting plot lines and interspercing clever contemporary references.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|They are fun and addictive, I am happy to see a second game available for the kindle (bubble witch saga is the other) and I hope they make more titles for the kindle as we can't download them from Google play.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a fabulous book that made you really think!  We think we know what we would do in all situations, but as I read on in the story, I found myself questioning decisions made.  How would I really react?  What would I do?  What should I do?  I discovered that nothing is black or white.....everything has shades of gray!<br /><br />I would recommend this to everyone, men and women alike.  There are always two sides to every story, but this book ties them together very well.<br /><br />Daisy
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really like this game.  It has many different things to draw, most of which are easy. However, it takes up a lot of space, and the free version has ads.  I highly recommend it, though.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|First time I used this app it is working great for printing from Kindle and phone as wireless connection. Great free app convenient for web needs.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|A great book, can't wait for the next one. A little slow at first, but once you understand it, you will love it.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This book has amazing literature. The characters are amazingly described. There is perfect descriptions of the battles. My favorite part of this book is when the Stone Table cracks and Aslan comes back to life.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Amazing, this book does not let up for a second. Brandon Sanderson  has finished excellently what robert Jordan started all those years ago.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|This one is fun, but a little hokey with the narration.  It is one of those match games that keeps you working, but adds an extra element of story line (narration) with the puzzle pieces that holds your interest.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|fantastic :  great game, impossible to put down told my sister about it, now she Bates me, she cant put it down.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Awesome book way different from the movie very well written and really showed you the other side of what people go through
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is one of my favorite  singers and I love his new CD and definitely would recommend to others.  Thanks.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|This is my third G5 game in as many days! Love the graphics, challenging puzzles &amp; great story lines!!! I haven't read a book in 3 days &amp; my children are happy because they get to play games when I do!!<br />I would love to have the games cost less because my husband doesn't like my spending the money as much as I don't like to spend it, but it is what it is!<br />I hope anyone who downloads these games enjoy them as much as I do!!!<br />A special thanks to the developers! Keep them coming!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I started purchasing theses books long before the show true blood (which I happen to love) and they got me back into reading after I hadn't picked up a book of fiction in 15 years.  The story was always interesting, surprising and unexpected.  This last book was a total and complete insult to the series and to the devoted fans that have put Charlaine Harris's name on the map by spending our money buying her books.  Not only does the story and ending in this book not fit with the series but it was poor writing, and just all around horrible in every imagineable way.  I was shocked, stunned, disappointed, I thought how can this be?  Then I decided to read the reviews to see if anyone else had the same conclusion as me and WOW, I was validated in my opinions when I got to amazon reviews on this book, most all of her loyal fans were totally and completely disappointed.  It is, as if she just threw something together to end the series, because she couldn't be bothered to actually put real thought and conclusion to the end, she was too busy writing other stuff that likely wouldn't even be read had it not been for the fans she gathered through this series.  I can only hope that these bad reviews will prevent her from ending another one of her series in such a horrible and disappointing way.<br /><br />I personally will never read anther book from this woman.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have other ways to stream media in my home, so I have actually only used it in some unusual situations (at friends' homes to demonstrate its functions), but I am very impressed so far. You cannot beat the value for the price, and it is very easy to set up and use. Google, please expand the capabilities of this device.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I had this game a couple days and I love it. I'm really addicted and I the it is the best game in the world. Think it is the best game there will ever be.
B006VDNDQI|4.0|This is a nice item, in fine condition, delivered very quickly. The content, however, really is not the plot of the book. This will disappoint anyone who is really a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Including the author as a character is nothing more than a gimmick. The effects are nice.
1594746036|4.0|The creepy black-and-white photograph on the cover of this novel caught my attention, as I'm sure it did many of this book's readers.  The photo is of a young girl dressed in very old-fashioned clothing who appears to be levitating perhaps a foot off the ground. As I flipped through the book, I found it contains other old photographs, such as a girl standing alone by a pool with two girls reflected back, a girl who holds a ball of glowing light in her hands, and a young boy lifting a large boulder with one hand. I was interested to see what a book containing such strange photos was about. It had the unique ability to pull me in before I had read a single word.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is the story of sixteen-year-old Jacob, who is struggling with the sudden death of his beloved grandfather. Jacob witnessed his grandfather's death at the hands of a monster in the woods, though no one believes him when he describes it. They chalk the story up to all the stories his grandfather told about a children's home on an island he stayed in during World War II and its strange inhabitants. His grandfather even saved photos of some of the children from the home, which he shared with Jacob before his death. Jacob's parents send him to therapy, where the psychiatrist convinces Jacob he imagined the whole thing and that his grandfather's stories were all fiction. Jacob is left trying to move on with his life, but he remembers his grandfather's last words about how he must find the bird on the island. Jacob convinces his father to take him to the island off the coast of Wales, and what he finds there leads him on a very strange adventure indeed.<br /><br />While reading this book, I found myself questioning what is real and not right along with Jacob. The author presents a unique scenario dealing with freakshow-type children, time travel, and monsters who dwell in the island's mist. Though this book wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, it was stillan entertaining read and kept me turning pages. I found the photographs used throughout the book to be a fun addition, but sometimes it felt like the author was writing the story to include them and not because they really needed to be part of the story. I would recommend this book for readers old enough to handle some foul language and gruesome scenes, though these are not a major part of the book. I look forward to the next installment in this series.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. It was the best book I ever read. More people should read this book. Yolo swag
B005IQZB14|4.0|I have a hard time rating this book. On one hand, the biography is of a young woman who basically is a mess since her mother died and she thinks hiking the PCT is going to help her &#34;find herself&#34;. She is very open about her life. On the other hand, it is interesting what she feels about the PCT and the people she meets. I can't understand how she did it without any experience, but it sounds like there's a lot of people out there who try it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well... it's cute and fun, very similar to subway surfer. It is not good for on the the go if u don't have WiFi because it constantly has to update.
B00940XIGU|4.0|This is a fun album.  I have eclectic tastes and this satisfied to my pop/dubstep/remix likes.  I am not ecstatic about all the songs, but a solid third of them made into my regular play list.  I bought it for Titanium alone and it came with a few other really good songs as well.  I'm satisfied.

1781162646|2.0|Mediocre Stephen King is a lot like mediocre pizza: easy to consume but a little too cheesy.  It pains me to have to give one of my favorite authors a less than stellar review.  JOYLAND burbles at a low boil, spicing the stew with supernatural tropes (ghosts, precognition, oh my) and a narrator who can't seem to find any urgency in his story.<br /><br />Young Devin Jones takes time away from college to work at a seaside amusement park among a familiar cast of carnies.  Friendships form, young love blossoms, and, naturally, a menace dwells amid the clanking rides and greasy concession stands.  It takes too long for the tension to build; the reader is plowing through some paint-by-numbers scenes that become relentless as nothing much happens, two hundred pages in.  The final scene is touching but only in an emotionally manipulative way.  Its source of heart is too easy and familiar - sorry to sound hardhearted.<br /><br />Were this not written by Stephen King, I doubt JOYLAND would have found its way into the marketplace as a publisher probably wouldn't have made it past the sludge.  But it's not without some charm.  The novel has nostalgia in its core, warming the pages as they turn.  But nostalgia and elegy are close neighbors.  The future for King's characters is never clear, but the passing of time is certain.  Aging takes a heavy toll, rolling over everyone.  It is inescapable and irreversible.  It is Stephen King's most terrifying boogieman, the one in all our closets.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. Helps relaxes me. Candy is awesome. I spend countless times playing with her. This game keep me coming back.
1476727651|4.0|In memories, apparitions, and genes, the past continues to haunt Danny Torrance.  DOCTOR SLEEP brings us up to speed on everything that’s happened since the Overlook burned to the ground, swallowing Dan’s father and the hotel’s horde of demons.  Dan’s special ability, his shining, still glows albeit dimly.  After a lifetime of struggling with his unique sensitivity, along with a congenital hankering for rage and addiction, Dan has found some peace through AA and supportive friends.  The monster within Dan, the monster he inherited from his father, is seemingly restrained.<br /><br />The past comes alive though when a frightening new element is added to THE SHINING universe.  The True Knot, an ancient, peripatetic tribe of supernaturals prey on those with the shining, extracting their essence through a torturous, gruesome procedure.  That puts The Knot and their convoy of motor homes on a collision course with Dan and a young girl who’s also blessed/cursed with the same ability.<br /><br />There’s a lot to love about this book.  The allegory on addiction shines (as it were), creating a compelling portrayal of alcoholism and all its nuances.  The plotting is tight and fast - as one would expect from The Master.  Sequels are hard to pull off, but King does a commendable job of both adding to the story and tying things up.  Much of the imagery will stay with the reader for a very long time (The True Knot inhaling the airborne remains of the World Trade Center victims, e.g).<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a B-movie element that detracts from an otherwise very good novel.  A particular plot twist involving the Torrance lineage could have been lifted from a discarded 80s soap opera script.  Also, aside from the primary villain and the primary protagonist, everyone else is pretty much an off-the-rack stereotype.  E.g. mildly precocious teenager and her mothering mother are aided by allies who include a physician who has no qualities other than he speaks English and has an MD.  This leaves certain parts of the novel feeling undercooked.<br /><br />Bottom line: hugely entertaining popcorn reading.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|the ending left me feeling I had missed a page or so.  I would recommend this book but prepare someone for the ending.  Perhaps I did miss a page!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|when I got the app I deleted all my apps and it still did not load on my kindle fire.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best supernatural based T.V series I have watched. They really get into the story line actors and the writers. Every season is a surprise just when you think the series can't take it any further they manage to do it.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|I hate this cast of actors more than I have ever hated the entire cast of a movie in my life. Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari are two of my least favorite actors in Hollywood, so why would I watch this movie? The trailer looked hilarious and that's really the point of trailers isn't it, to get you to watch a film you wouldn't otherwise be interested in. The story follows Dwayne, a spoiled rich kid who won't grow up. Dwayne and his buddy Travis hatch a drunken plan, to off Dwayne's father for the insurance money, using a pizza boy as a pawn in a murder for hire scheme. The pizza boys job is simple, rob a bank or the bomb they've strapped to his chest explodes. The clock is running out for pizza boy Nick, along with his best friend Chet, they have to come up with a plan before they're blown to bits. With this cast and the same Writer/Director as Zombieland, I was expecting all the funny parts to be in the trailer, but I was pleasantly surprised. That Facebook kid, Jesse Eisenberg stars and is actually pretty funny, he always reminds me of Michael Cera, only less lanky and gay. His Co-star is Danny McBride, who is my top 10 list of least favorite actors. It's not that he's a bad actor, but he's just so over the top with everything he does, that it destroys anything that could have been funny. Surprisingly, McBride is pretty toned down in this film and for once you could actually see that he can be very funny in the right circumstances. The story wasn't bad, but it isn't as unique as you might think. About 20 years ago this actually happened and in that case the pizza boy was killed, so turning it into a comedy may not have been the most sensitive thing to do. As for the film, it was a lot funnier than I was expecting and the cast actually had some really good chemistry. It's not the funniest film you'll ever see, but it's certainly a good way to kill a couple of hours.
B003B02O14|4.0|Grisham never disappoints me.  I've been an avid reader of his books for years.  Would recommend that to anyone who likes lawyer-type stories.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the story. I love how he came from such a sad beginning and became a very rich man and I can picture him as gorgeous. I fell sorry for him and fell in love with him at the same time. Then Ana came into his life and could understand his 50 shades of personality.<br />I can't wait for the movie.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun but the longer you play the shorter your time gets.  Not clear on all the items you earn.  Not sure what the point is.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|for having that many games in it... it didnt have good ones at all.  They were all boring and kiddie games.  Even my 10yr old didnt like it.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I grow up watching this movie so I was so happy to see it on here!..I pop some poocorn and watched it with my little girl and she loved it..this is really a classic!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Got this because I lost my Kindle Cable.  It worked great on the Kindle and it actually works on several other electronics that I have.
B00FEAZGDC|5.0|Delightful, uplifting film.  well acted by a great cast.  Schmaltzy perhaps, but at 90 minutes, well worth a look.  Venessa Redgrave is outstanding in this touching role.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is the absolute best search engine ever.  We really enjoy our google products and apps.  They pretty much keep our house running.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Awesomely fun, puzzles and good challenges. My kids love it as much as I do. It was free when I got it, it's worth having.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I really didnt care for it.  I didnt give me the help that I thought I would get with it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very addictive. I enjoy this game very much.  Have not seen any glitches. Could be used to teach spacial theory to kids.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so super excited to see that there's a kindle fire version now it allows me to be able to play anywhere I am super stoked ty ty ty
B00AL1P9PY|4.0|I bought this as an album, oh so many years ago. I love the entire 2112 suite; after Xanadu, it's my favorite Rush song (I know it's multiple songs, but just like Fountains of Lamneth, it's listed as one and you can't buy all parts individually). I love how the guys keep weaving in the same melodies throughout the various songs. The biggest problem with the album is that apart from 2112, Passage to Bangkok and Something for Nothing, the remaining songs just don't really do anything for me.<br />Rush fans already know this album. But if you're new to Rush, this was the standard until Moving Pictures. I highly recommend it; just know that some of the songs (on what would originally have been the B side) you will probably listen to a couple times and never again. Still, you need to listen to 2112 suite straight through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for kids of all ages!!! Me and my little brother play this game 24/7 and we love it!!!!!!!!!
B00138H7HW|4.0|It won't rank in the top 3 for Joe, but still a good effort. There are a larger number of songs than a typical CD, and Satch tries several different sounds and styles. The flow of the songs, listening straight through, is a little odd so changes from one to the next can feel a bit disjointed. But, I can't say there is a song I don't like. Still, apart from the main hook on Ceremony, there isn't really anything that stuck with me as other Satch songs have.<br />All that said, it's still an enjoyable CD. I probably would give it 3.5 stars if I could. So, following the rules of rounding, I rounded up.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|This app works well but not for me. My friends like for me to send them the short stories I make with this app it's not easy to send them my stories. Also, I type with Swype and this app doesn't space the words when you type like that. If this sounds like you then I don't recommend this app.
0307951154|5.0|Another addictive Harry Hole novel - as usual, don't get used to liking any one character except Harry - they are all expendable!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've been looking for a book like this my whole life and I finally found it. Thank you John Green
0307742997|5.0|Addictive storytelling, great main character, the action at the end is like going downhill on a roller coaster - loved it
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It is the greatest game that I ever played. The graphics look 100% realistic. The sounds are perfect. Good game.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this app and cannot put it down because it is addicting.  You must use logic skills to uncover the hidden picture.  The app can be both easy and hard depending on your layout choices.  The graphics are so good that I cannot determine whether they are photos or drawings.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|A different role for Matthew as Mud and he was superb.  The young boy that played Elliot is going to be someone to watch.  Definitely worth seeing.
B00CAYHVKQ|5.0|Fun and inspiring!!!  I recommended it to all of my friends and we are having a great time doing the experiments! A positive and magical way to view life.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally on Kindle!  This game is addicting! A fun, mind numbing way to waste time!  I just can't stop playing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire. It was easy to down load and easier to play than using real cards,  especially when traveling.
B004XZR63M|1.0|I was really drawn into his story until I discovered it was all made up. Rich Dad never existed. Don't waste your money. Keep looking, the goal to be financially free is a noble and achievable goal!
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Lost most people, I never heard of Rodriguez before the movie. After the movie I bought all the albums. No regrets.
B000FC12C8|5.0|This book covers everything you need to know about truly investing in the market. This book, combined with a website like [...] is the perfect combination!
B006W5JF9Y|5.0|There are several Bob Dylan covers on this album that are among the all-time greatest. I would rank them with Hendrix's Watchtower. There are, however, lots of ones that I hope I never hear ever again, but no points off for those -- listen once, forget forever. There are so many tunes on this album that you'll definitely find a few worthy ones to be worth the price for all.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This product is a very wonderful application. I was very dissapointed that this app did not have a built-in speed test. If it did I was not able to locate it and use it properly. Other than that is a great app for analyzing surrounding wifis.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't like the control he had over her & the fact that she let him have such a complete control over everything she did.  She gave up her life & her beliefs to be with him even though she questioned it.  I was happy that in the end, she went back to her own way of life & gave him & his control away.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|This has become one of my favorite movies. Jim Caviezel is the new Harrison Ford. The DVD was in perfect condtion, and arrived very early.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Those game is so addicting, and fun. This game can't and won't disappoint. Get this game I was so exited Egan it came to Amazon it was great.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I knew this book would be a powerful story but I never imagined<br /><br />change<br /><br />I<br /><br />what a powerful story of never ending hope and endurance
1439153663|5.0|I actually read this book twice....usually don't do that with a novel, but it is a book club pick and I had read it in 2010.....and forgot<br />a lot.<br />Reading it again was good.....great story, though a novel, it is historically fact.  A part of American history that is shameful, and sad.<br />Applause to the author Kathleen Grissom, who will be speaking to my book club via phone on our meeting date!!<br />MN
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I am enjoying this game. Not too hard and I like having a story to follow along with. It's a basic match three game.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|I can't say enough good this about this movie.  It uses the mind and suspense beautifully to really scare you.  Also, since it is based on one of the Warren's actual cases, makes it even more spine chilling.  I thank the Warren's for there work and the courage for doing it.  Also, even the courage to allow them to be seen by the general public.
1609611543|5.0|I loved this book.  It's all the more believable with the biblio of all the tests others have run.  Have eliminated wheat for a week now and feel amazingly more energized.  Waiting now to see how blood work and weight loss (if any) follow.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was wonderful to wrap up a story that's been in my mind for years. KING IS AN AMAZING STORYTELLER. I can never put down one of his books, and I'm always sad when I finish one. I wish he could live forever to write stories. They've held my hand many times over the years and I could never express enough thanks to Stephen King for doing what he does. He feels like a friend.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Major time sink so watch out. I can play it for hours and time slips by quickly.puzzles are fun. Great experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|What a great book. I really enjoyed Hopeless.<br /><br />Possible Spoilers:<br /><br />It is the story of Sky and Holder. They meet and fall for each other. They realize they knew each other as children and that together they share a tragic past. Hopeless is a heart wrenching story of child abuse, kidnapping, and teenage suicide. I know for some people it is unrealistic way to wrap up the issues but I didn't have an problem with it. Is it how it likely would have happened in real life? Probably not but hey this is a fictional story. I think that Ms. Hoover did a great job in addressing the issues in the situations she created for the characters.<br /><br />I loved Sky and Holder is awesome. While brash and a bit rough around the edges I loved Six too! The characters were deleoped and the plot went smoothly. I was a little nervous when I realized the book jumped around in time a bit but it worked well with the story telling.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Hopeless and can't wait to read Finding Hope!!!! Keep it up Ms. Hoover!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I have only played a few rounds and truly enjoy this game.  It is similar to bejeweled and diamond dash .
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a fun game and is kinda like a military Sims but much better. It takes a little bit of time to get used to but is fun once you learn how to play and how the game works.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This hidden objects game is addictive. I did think I was gonna like it but I do. I played so long my battery went dead.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I find this show very amusing and at times insightful. I watch it often and come away smiling. I am a Downtown Abbey Fan as well. Both are great shows.

1612191290|1.0|Graeber is an anthropologist, not an economist, and it is painfully obvious.  In his CV he claims to be a economic anthropologist, which is not a real subdiscipline.  His lack of knowledge of economics is evident within the first few pages.  He repeatedly states that the study of economics is that of \\"how people seek to maximize their utility\\" and is therefore \\"an impersonal field\\" which \\"completely compartmentalizes the human experience.\\"  Hopefully, any student who has taken a course in economics realizes that this is false.<br /><br />The study of economics is the study of how individuals and groups of people make decisions given scarce resources.  Maximizing utility is an assumption of neo-classical models.  Graeber continually denigrates the entire field of economics, and goes on diatribes about basic thought experiments proposed throughout the fields history, while failing to grasp the basic ideas put forward in these expirements.  Not a single assertion he makes invalidates the study of economics.<br /><br />Graeber seems to want to re-fight the battle between the Marxists and the Utilitarians of the early 19th century all over again, but this time dress it in a Guy Fawkes mask and call it something different.  Graeber can get away with all of this, and many other blatant factual errors (see other reviewers for more details), because this is not peer reviewed publication.<br /><br />Sorry Graeber, but you may be able to get away with this mumbo jumbo in Zuccotti park, but you will probably never be published in a real economics journal.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved this book! Can't wait to read Atniss'next adventure. I will read it again, especially since I have it in my kindle library.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this book and the ones before to anybody who can read! I gave it 5 stars and Suzanne Collins did a great job telling what Katniss was feeling and thinking. I know that this is the final book but it would be awesome if Suzanne Collins were to write another book about the kids and if they had some sort of war. I really love these books..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thrilled that Candy Crush Saga is finally available to play on Kindle Fire! Sound and graphics are excellent plus it's a lot of fun to play! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting so long for this game to come out and thank you it is out! Download this game. You won't regret it and if you don't like the game just delete it. There is no penalty because it is free! I also advise you to use a Facebook account if you have one just in case your kindle erases all the data. Get the game!
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|The Tiny Thief is a bit like Robin Hood, in that his thieving is always for the good of man and/or animal. This game starts out easy... but then requires some serious thought in order to complete a level with maximum success. Forget about the pet weasel and you won't get full credit. Leave some &#34;extra&#34; items behind (that are not part of the prime objective) and you will not get full credit. Graphics, sound and controls are all quite good. Little hands and arrows show up at points in the game indicating that you can climb up or down, or hide in or exit a barrel, or use some found item (such as a fishing pole in one level and a bag of nuts in another).
B00B84652O|5.0|long live the king. got this for my brother and he has been jamming the hell out of it. all great albums, all very different but the best of king diamond if you ask me.
0385743564|2.0|After Mistborn I found Steelheart very disappointing. Predictable, shallow characters, lots of action - I never felt invested in the outcome. I know Sanderson churns out books, and reading this it is very obvious. I won't be reading any of his books again.
B000RJO578|4.0|its pretty funny, not as good as shawn of the dead though. but its second best out of other crap (like that stupid alien movie) they put out
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Since I am no longer using a smart phone i needed something moble for the game.  Highly addictive it is!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A sad, but also beautiful and fabulous  season!  You can't help but love the characters.  Can't wait for season 4!;
B007SGLZP8|1.0|What I recall from the book is the confusion of points of view. I may not be the best read person ever, but I had never encountered a plural point of view, when one character is narrating the events as if looking through the eyes of another and using &#34;we&#34; and &#34;us&#34; when the reader knows that these two characters are in different places, different countries even! Another thing is that these narrators kept knowledge from the readers... I felt manipulated and there was no joy for me in reading the story, no satisfaction in the outcome. Unless you are a diehard fan who will accept this kind of dismal effort in writing, this is not a worthwhile read.
B0062NAVXA|4.0|Inspiring movie, arrived in time and perfect condition.  What else is there to say except a few words to fill the space.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn does not disappoint.  This novel was a page turner from the beginning and full of twist and turns.  The main character is very complex with a darkness that haunts her.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I was transported. I could see the colors, feel the mass of humanity, smell the smells.  Intrigue and a tale to dive into.
1250038820|5.0|couldn't have asked for more. Great to come back home to find an amazon package and know whats waiting inside.<br />now I can have tangible pictures rather than pixels across my screen. so worth the wait. will stay on my coffee table for quite some time. great job, Brandon.<br /><br />from a hony fan
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent! It was a great follow up to &#34;The Shining.&#34; Another King classic. Stephen King is truly a master of suspense.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game, so far. Text boxes are a little too small to read with ease. Wish they could be increase in size. Please add this option.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Well, I didn't really purchase it, I watched it through Amazon Prime.  The movie was really good, great action and acting.  It did a perfect job replicating the comics.
B0063M22QO|5.0|So much fun. I can't stop playing. You need to get this app. It improves my eye coordination. I love it. It was worth the coins.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun to play! I'm so glad Amazon made it available for the Kindle Fire. It's a perfect mix of easy and challenging levels. I like that it periodically makes you wait for the next level. You have a choice to pay if you don't want to wait. Great game, I highly recommend for older children and adults.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The only real flaws preventing me from giving this five stars is the lack of music and maximum fifteen by fifteen grid. Definitely geared more towards beginners. Still, plenty of puzzles and the interface works well enough. Should keep you busy for awhile!
B0000089FS|3.0|Elton's mid-80's albums were competent, but not exactly brimming with enthusiasm or vitality. After Leather Jackets (probably his weakest album of original material) and vocal surgery he returned with this album in 1988. It's certainly more energetic than his previous, maybe he wanted to prove himself this time. Some of the ballads is melodically fine: A word in spanish, Japanese hands etc. Also, the hit, I don't wanna go on with you like that, is a moderately catchy up-tempo number. But some of the other songs seem more formulaic, repetitive and melodically ordinary. The performances shows more vitality than some of his other 80's records, his voice is stronger than on Leather Jackets, but when he gets energetic the performances tend towards the hectic, not allowing the music to breathe naturally. This is mostly for hardcore fans, casual listeners is better of with several of his older albums from the 70's or more recent (2000-). Fans of adult-contemporary might get The One or Made in England instead (I'm not crazy about those).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing Candy Crush Saga on my android phone for a few months now and I wanted to be able to play it on my kindle fire. I found tutorials on the internet on how to download it from Google play onto the kindle fire, however I didn't feel comfortable doing that. When I saw that Candy Crush Saga was released on Oct 17 for the kindle fire, I downloaded it right away. It works beautifully and it is so nice to have it on a larger screen. I have the kindle fire HD 8.9. This is a very fun app and you can ask your friends on Facebook to send you a life. So far I haven't paid for any lives. If I run out and I don't have any lives from my friends, I just wait until later to play again.  I highly recommend downloading this app onto your kindle fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Some of the imitation games where absolutely awful. Thank goodness the real Candy Crush Saga has finally come to the Kindle world.  It took a long time but was worth the wait. Yup I'm hooked.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited when I was finally able to get this app on my kindle fire. and it was a free app so that was another bonus.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love Maroon 5, I think Adam has an amazing voice. I usually don't purchase albums because there aren't enough good songs for the money.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME.  IT DOES FREEZE UP AND SLOW DOWN OCCASSIONALLY.  ALL AROUND MY FAVORITE GAME THOUGH.  IT WOULD BE A RUNNER UP TO ANGRY BIRDS.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I didn't expect this move be an Osar movie, but it was. The young girl deserve an Oscar. It was very exciting movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is awesome, damn shame he died. I would have liked to shake his hands and tell him thanks
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game a lot, its fun for anyone who enjoys playing bingo or slots.  Its a good game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My niece and nephews luv this game. They fight over who goes first and can spend hours playing minion rush.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game better any other .Finally it's the real deal it's not a puzzle it the real deal
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Oh my gosh!! Yesterday I just realized this app was on android and I have been wanting it forever!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING THIS ON ANDROID!!!!!!! I recommend this app for everyone!
B003NX75B8|4.0|Fun coming of age story, crossing so many borders.  Warm and funny, made me think about my high school days so long ago.  I recommend this to anyone!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a page turner I didn't want to put it Down.<br />I would recommend it for book clubs.<br />You could have a lot of good discussions with this book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works fine. Easy to install, just follow directions. I wish I could use it to transmit as an extra screen for my laptop. Otherwise no problem.
B00FQPHOPI|1.0|\\"Man of Steel\\" feels like a throwback to 8 or 10 years ago when directors and producers were in love with CGI special effects for their own sake.  It doesn't have to be that way. When special effects are used to advance a story rather than to take it over, the results can be truly spectacular. Avatar proved that as did Star Wars before that.  I had hoped that Avatar had put an end to the CGI-for-CGI's-Sake big budget film, but apparently Christopher Nolan, who produced Man of Steel, didn't get the memo.<br /><br />The director and producers of Man of Steel were more into a special effects extravaganza than into presenting a film with a dramatic core or characters to which the audience can relate. There's nothing wrong with the special effects except that there's far too much of them and everything else in the film plays second fiddle to one more explosion, crashing building, or fist fight.<br /><br />Batman benefited from the Christopher Nolan treatment. Superman doesn't.<br /><br />If non-stop special effects are your thing, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, it's a big disappointment and does not bode well for the future of the Superman franchise in its current reincarnation.<br /><br />Here's a tip for you: If you can pretend this is a film about a never before seen super hero, you'll probably enjoy it more because this film is more about Christopher Nolan's ego than it is about Superman.
0143116738|4.0|Some people got angry that the book did not give recipes for finding their own element. My initial though, after reading 10 pages, was that it will not help me, as I am an adult reading and people described here are 18 years old at most. So, The point the author is making is that we need to change our ways to help our children find their element. Frankly, if every one has that potential passion in them, there must be a way to tap in there and the earlier, the easier. If your mind and body haven't a achieved that, then there is no point in getting angry that no one has told how to find it, as it probably was never that important...
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|Graphics difficult and sluggish. Love the characters they are funny. They just don't move right. Will play every once and awhile
B007WULJ5G|5.0|between extreme pedophilia and balls to the wall, unapologetic sex-enhanced gore, this film will take you to places you've never even seen in your nightmares. a must-see! but will be the hardest film you EVER sit thru.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was determined to never go e reader. I don't currently own a Kindle and never felt i'd have use for anything like this. I couldn't ever electronically replace that feeling of holding a book. I was given a book to do a review on it and it of course wasn't a physical copy. I was then forced to download this for my home computer to read the book and full fill my obligations. I have to say i was so very wrong to hate on this without ever trying it. I am very pleased with it. While it of course isn't the joy of holding the book it is a very convenient way to read books. I was pleased with the quality of the books i was reading and loved that i could download it to my cell phone and take the books with me.<br /><br />I am very happy i gave in and downloaded this. I am sure it will be used on a regular basis. I do hope to in the future be able to get an actual Kindle but not sure when.<br /><br />What a great product i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun... i am really glad i downloaded this game and you can not beat the price of FREE for such a high quality game! options to purchase upgrades but it is not needed to enjoy the game. Beautiful graphics!
0446569895|5.0|I am a huge fan of Ozzy and when i was able to finally read this book i was so excited. I was not disappointed!<br /><br />This has to be one of the absolute best biography I've read. I have read many of these type books but this one, this one was absolutely incredible. It kept me interested right from the beginning. Learning about Ozzy's life with his wife the band etc was great. Very well written and keeps you wanting more. It was also an emotional read. I experienced so many emotions reading this book. From extreme happiness to extreme sadness. I laughed literally out loud on a few parts to the point i was crying. This book covers all the basis and was just absolutely enjoyable to read.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Ozzy or just a fan of biographies this is a must have.<br /><br />5 HUGE STARS for a most epic read.
B006ID01OS|5.0|I've read a lot of strategy books. This is a great book to start with and then heads towards higher-level approaches. All the basic and must-knows are here.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I've been playing a little over a week and love it!! I just wish it were a little easier to expand and attract neighbors.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|What an easy, fun way to learn Spanish!  It's a very pleasant quarter hour or so of my day.  I've tried using books, but it's tedious & boring.  CD 's don't work as well.  And a class may be just as good, but it's less convenient.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I didn't hear much about this movie and put off watching it.  But I really enjoyed it and enjoyed the new version of earth, that sadly was no longer people friendly, but was much more healthy otherwise.  I thought Jada did a great job and I liked the way they had the father and son interact remotely. I thought that worked well.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this story, which started slowly but, soon, I had a hard time putting it down.<br />Based in history, the book interwove the stories of a present day orphan with the<br />story of an elderly woman, who had gone west on the 'orphan trains&#34; in the early<br />20th century.  The book is based on the actual &#34;orphan trains,&#34; a wonderful, inspiring<br />story based on history.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great product for the price.  I found it to be quite easy to set up, and it works reliably (one reboot in a month).  I've only used it with Netflix so far.  More apps would be a good thing, but Google seems to be slow walking the process.  But for $35, it does the job.
0375869026|5.0|I'm a 5th grade teacher, and I'd love to see my kids reading this book with their families. There's just so much here that's good to talk about. I especially love the way the author switches POV's - showing us what's happening not only in the main character's head, but also with his sister, her best friend, and even a boy who betrays him. For anyone who's been bullied - or been the witness to bullying (oh, wait, that's everyone!) this book is a great conversation starter.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|Classic Beatle songs.  All I can say is that this collection with the Red Album gives an amazingly thorough and great set.
B000IDEORY|5.0|This is the most awesome love story. From the music to the dancing you will not be disappointed. Miss Patrick Swayze...
B000B5OD4I|2.0|Seiko skx007 is one of the most desiarable watches for<br />the watch collectors. Although its glass is not real glass, no<br />hacking function, no manual winding,  horrible bracelet, when<br />I received it,  this watch did not disapointed me, because I already<br />knew all the bad things.  I really wanted to like it and keep it. ....but<br />the crown was not centered and not right angled.
B005DOL0R0|1.0|My Kindle Fire HD 7'' cannot be zipped into this zip sleeve.  It appears to be a good quality sleeve, but it is too small to accomodate<br />my Kindle.  I will return it
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|I was hoping it would be more about his rise to fame. Disappointed that the movie focused only on the point in time that led to his greatest success. It was still good enough to watch, but not necessarily to watch again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well done! This was was a terrifically engaging story with all the great world building necessary for the best sci first books, also the characters were believable and appealing. My one challenge is that there wasn't a break in the action until the very end. I think it would have been better paced if there were a few moments when juliette gets to solo 17 to build up to further action, instead of keeping it at a high level the whole time. It would have given me a chance to invest even more deeply with all the characters. Still, this was a pleasure to read. Thank you!
B000083E79|5.0|Like Cher? Get this! Love Cher? Get this! Wanna just learn some of her older stuff? Get this! JUST GET THIS!
0786888628|5.0|I have been a history buff since I studied under two fine history professors at my University.  One was a WWII Army ranger who made it all the way from Italy to the Elbe River.  He made the obvious but nevertheless telling observation that while many Germans swam the river from the Russian side to the American side he didn't see any Germans swim to the Russian side.  This little remark drove the point home better than anything I've read about the Russian hatred for the Nazis.<br /><br />Anyway I loved this book.  So many history books are dry and scholarly to the point I find my mind wandering.  But \\"The Coldest Winter\\" was so gripping and interesting I could hardly put it down.  I got a better feel for what happened in Korea from Halberstam's book than I got from everything else I've studied.  I'm going to look for other books written by him.<br /><br />If you're interested in the Korean war, and it's a war worth studying, then this may be the only reading you need to do.  After all this conflict was not only a large one, with millions of fatalities, but it was the unambiguous beginning of the Cold War.
0060775858|5.0|Goodnight Moon is one of my favorite all time classic books.  The book is a must for every nursery to read at bedtime!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always a great read from Mr. GRISHAM. His characters are always interesting. I do think that GRISHAM always does his research. I READ the last half of the book a day and a half (I am a slow reader usually and get bored reading easily).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive game fun, even my daughter love display this game!Love this game!!! If u are looking for a good game this is the game for you!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|A friend recommended that I give this series a try.  That's exactly what I intended to do - just try it...for one episode.  I was completely captivated from the very first scene.  Now I find myself watching this when I get ready in the morning, when I'm waiting for an appointment, when my family is watching virtually anything else.  It's a terrific series.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good read. To me on King's better stories. Interesting take in how Danny from the shining would end up. Kept my interest from start to finish.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|I have always loved to read novels by this author and this was no different with this one too. It kepted me glued to the end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun way to pass time while waiting in line or waiting in a doctor's office.  and it is free!  I recommend this for any age.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that the kindle can now down load this game yea!!!!!!!  The game keeps u playing its fun. Something you and all it friends share.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|great for nanny - grannie cam.  very easy to use anywhere.  setup / view from cell phone - pc - laptop - tablet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just wrote a review about survivalcraft and how I wanted a refund x20 for this game.<br /><br />Survivalcraft is cheaper, better graphics, more animals, electrics, and infinite worlds. Please, get SC instead on this carp. You'll instantly agree with me.
B00F880BWG|3.0|Starting to get a bit too soap-operaish .<br />The gore level also seems to increase with each season. But for the short term we're still watching!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is pretty fun. I would recommend it to people who like games that take some time to figure out, sometimes.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very useful for me because I spend long hours to watch YouTube more than TV<br /><br />Thank you thank you thank you
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I really like this game. its the most fun when you make up people and make them fight.well worth the money.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A good little puzzle/logic game.  As mentioned before, no bad permissions/spyware and no bugs that I've yet to find.  They do have an extra picture to unlock, can do it through Facebook or with a review, so good either way I suppose.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|really???? come on!!!! I can under stand if a little girl likes this game. but come on. you cant call your self a man if you play this game. its cover says enough. who ever made this game clearly made it for a little girl.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I started out enjoying this book, but lost interest about halfway through.  Had to push through to keep reading.  Anything that could go wrong in these people's lives, went wrong.  Another reviewer mentioned that the author should have used some Irish dialect to indicate Lavinia was Irish.  I completely agree.  Lavinia was too passive and made too many poor choices.  The author wrapped up the ending pretty quickly in a somewhat happy ending, but it was dissatisfying to me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for so long for this addictive game to finally come to the Kindle Fire! I am especially happy to see that they have included th  addition of free boosters to this version. Way to go King and Amazon!
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|I don't have a lot of extra money to spend going to the movies like I used to, so a trailer really has to catch my eye if I am going to spend my money.    The Conjuring's trailer sure as heck caught my eye, especially when it said \\"based on a true story\\".  Now, those four words could mean quite a few things, so I did a bit of research and found out just how TRUE this story was.  HOLY MOLY was I in for a shock!  The eldest daughter of the Perron family was open about her experiences and is even writing a trilogy.  On her website she has an FAQ section.  The answer to the Question \\"Is the Conjuring exactly how it happened? Is it true?\\"  the answer is    \\"In Andrea's words, \\"[The Conjuring] is essentially true. There are elements of fiction in it; however - for the most part - in broad, sweeping strokes, it captures the true elements of what we endured for ten years in this farmhouse.\\" (from an interview with CBS This Morning on July 27, 2013)\\"    The link to her website is:  [...]    You can also google her, Angela Perron.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|We have seen this movie on TV quite often and just can't get enough of it.  Have not seen it in years but it is the best movie we have ever seen
B000JMKTLO|4.0|quite a page turner, waiting to see who dunnit great story line very different !! hoping to see more books by this author she knows how to keep the reader engrossed
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its addicting I just wish you could start out farther down the path after you die. I feel like I'll never see the next level
B006LSZECO|5.0|best book i have read in long time could not put it down ,read it over a weekend in the summer , such a clever story read gillian flynn's two other books after this one cant wait for more to come
B0006B2A42|4.0|A classic &#34;cold war&#34; thriller that Howard Hugh's reportedly viewed over 150 times during his last years.  Predictable, but enjoyable.
B0027MJU00|4.0|excellent kept me turning pages read this after Gone Girl which was brilliant cant wait for more Gillian Flynn books in future
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It was worth it. I didn't want to give my money to Google. I had to wait till it came to Amazon to play. I watched my friends become obsessed and I knew I would like it because I love match 3. I have not needed to buy anything yet so I am happy to report that this is IAP for right.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to have candy crush on my kindle fire. This game is so fun and addictive. Can't get enough of it.
0399159347|5.0|What would you do if you found out a secret that changes not only your life but the lives of every one in your small community?  One of the women in the book does discover a dark secret, and like Pandora's box, when you open something up you just never know what you will find or how if will affect not only you but everyone around you.<br /><br />I was spell-bound by this book.  What to do? What to do? ran through my mind constantly. What would I do?  Would I end the life that I led with my children?  Would I keep the secret and let it rot me from within?  How could I continue knowing a devastating secret and not tell those who needed to know?  The moral dilemma's found in [[ASIN:0399159347 The Husband's Secret]] will make one of the character's in this book feel she is rotting from within.  Should she tell or should she keep quiet?<br /><br />I could not put this book down and I actually felt sick myself when one of the women in the book discovers the secret. I could feel the fright and the sickness that she felt.  The writing is just that good.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too much of the plot but there is something here for everybody.  An old mystery that has not been solved.  The moral dilemma's that need to be answered.  I loved the story and was transfixed from the beginning until the very last page. The Husband's Secret resonates long after you close the last page.
B008EL25LE|4.0|A nice,fast Time Killer. Scenery is pretty well done. And it's easy to play with a stylus. Easy to see without glasses, too...
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Already bought the second book - can't wait to start reading. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Couldn't put it down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the the back and forth plot of the main characters' perspective. I enjoyed the beginning when I was not sure  what had taken place and if Nick had murdered his wife. As the story progressed I was not as intrigued, as details unfolded, and I kept putting the book down and coming back to it days later. I did finish it, but was not satisfied with the end. I was glad to be finished reading it. If I like a book I hate to see it come to an end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for the Kindle version.  Well worth the wait.  Great game and it works smoothly on my Kindle fire.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Going through Amazon Instant Videos on Prime and saw this.  My wife's instant reaction was, \\"I'm not interested.\\"  But she sat and watched the whole thing and by the end admitted that she enjoyed it.  Personally, I thought it was great.  I love a well done documentary and the soundtrack was pretty awesome as well.  I recommend this to anyone that is a fan of artists such as Neil Young, Foo Fighters, Nine Inch Nails, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Fear, Nirvana or any number of others.  Very entertaining and educational about the history of this music studio, the equipment they used and the artists that recorded there.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I'm so glad I new the outcome... it was very intense! The acting and action was so real. I would highly recommend this movie.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|James Horner is an excellent composer and I would recommend this soundtrack. There is a good variety and you can re-create the scenes in the movie as you listen to the score.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|I watched the entire first two seasons and quite honestly, wasn't sold on the show yet.  But my friend said to stick with it and after watching Season 3 (in like one week!), HE WAS RIGHT!!!<br /><br />This season was much, much better.  The first two were just standard \\"zombie fare\\" with humans running from slow moving zombies and some getting bit and dying.  Season 3 introduced MUCH more interesting characters (I just love Michonne and welcomed back Merle!!!) and really enjoyed the conflict with the Governor and the town of Woodbury.<br /><br />I will be purchasing Season 4 today and look forward to the Governor, hopefully, dying a slow and hideous death!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love, love, LOVE &#34;NCIS&#34; and its sister program NCIS:  Los Angeles.  Great acting, great characters, great story lines.  We watch it on CBS, USA, DIRECTV On Demand and would have it running 24/7 if we didn't feel the need to keep up on the news.  One of the all time BEST series on TV.  (Sure are going to miss Ziva!!0
B00E1LTEG0|5.0|Once you start watching THE WHITE QUEEN you may get hooked. I am not current on my historical knowledge of this period. None the less, I will just say that there is a certain voyeuristic appeal to this series. There is a lot of underhanded plotting and conspiracy and sexual promiscuity to keep you watching and making sure you come back for more. You may need a score card of the characters and the events as you get deeper into the series. Your sympathies with certain characters and their circumstances may change as you get into the thick of it. It is captivating. That is for certain.
0812982622|5.0|The violence was hard to take but North Korea is not kind to its citizens.  According to evidence from those who make it out it was accurate and well researched. The writing was very good and the change to multiple voices in the second half an interesting perspective.  I read it twice and got even more the second time around!<br />Kitty Liebhardt
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Saw it in the theaters and wanted to see it again in 3D. Good buy if you will watch it several times like we did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Friends recommended this game to me.  Glad I can play it on my Kindle. A lot of fun to play and be challenged.  Recommend this game for everyone--not just kids.
B007TVANDM|5.0|I teach PreK and this is our favorite! Pete the cat is Awesome! We have the song versions as well! Thank you for such a great book to share with children!
B005T87QCI|3.0|It is an awesome game to have but you have to buy the robots you don't get them for free.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is almost as fun as playing with real deck. Wish you could set it to accept different scenarios. Nice.
B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|I have enjoyed this new CD very much. Its a very good CD. The only thing that makes if fall just slightly short of a 5 star CD is that its just a bit too similar to her last few cd'S and it misses having that one classic type of song. Please don't get me wrong this is still very good.<br /><br />Woman's World is a typical dance song but its done very well and Cher's voice and singing style is what puts it above all the many current dance songs out there. She actually does her best when she slightly strays from the dance formula. \\"I Walk Alone\\" featuring Pink is very good and you realize how good Cher can be. \\"Lovers Return\\" has a slight rock feel to it and I believe Rock is where Cher really wants to be. \\"I Hope You Find It\\" and \\"Lie To Me\\" are a bit slower and a welcome change. The bonus songs on here are top notch for bonus songs so I also HIGHLY recommend the deluxe version. The rest of the CD is just typical dance music you can hear all over the place. Not being critical of the dance formula as Cher some how make a generic genre sound very good. A Very good CD you will surely enjoy.
B008P9M614|5.0|Gave this to my wife for her birthday. She loves this show. She has been watching more or less non-stop since she got it.
B0060KH8EU|5.0|This is a very high Quality sounding cd. If you are a true Audiophile then this is the &#34;Live at The Acropolis&#34; cd version that you want!<br />Just Superb!! I have two other versions of this cd, just pure garbage, as compared to this version by Sony. This is the &#34;best&#34;. This cd is the way &#34;Yanni&#34; should sound!! I highly recommend this cd for its superb &#34;Sound&#34; quality.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|If love the vibrant colors and that you can pick whether you want the pieces to be able to be turned or not.I like this puzzle game much better then the others on here.<br /><br />not.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|*Contains some info that may be spoilers* I love this movie. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it would have had some flashbacks of their choldhood to show how awful the father was to make them leave in the first place. Other than that it was great.
B00005JPKE|3.0|The movie as of course excellent from a technical and acting point of view as one would expect from Clint Eastwood. However unless you have a knowledge of history you would never know that the Japanese Imperial army massacred hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and systematically raped hundreds of thousands of Korean and Chinese women. I finished the movie and I said so what? I knew before the movie that the Japanese were people too. However, they were people who did horrible things to other people. This \\"all people are the same\\" attitude simply makes us weak in opposing evil acts.
B00AX6KMGS|4.0|I like this movie. Its a bit of invasion of the body snatchers with a twist revamped for 2000. Its more suspense/who done it/who can you trust than explosions and car chases. Its definitely not for everyone though. If you like teen/young adult sci-fi you'll like it. If you expect a lot of big budget explosion Aliens type movie then you won't.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|I love this movie! I've watched it many times. kate Beckinsale and Hugh Hackman are awesome in this movie. The graphics are great. Yeah, there are a gew things that wouldve been nice to have, such as  better character development. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|From the first day I installed this, I have had no problems with it.  I often review my emails from my Kindle or phone, and it's great to just print the ones I need without having to go into my office.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite game!  Glad it came on the Kindle. It is fun and full of challenges for me.
B008MM9630|5.0|Easy game anyone can play, if you love farming and fairies then this is perfect for you. Great for big or little kids and adults
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I have not watched the movie yet, wanted to read the book first.  It was ok, maybe I am not easily impressed.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|this game is terrible and wont let me open it and if it does open it don't wok and I have to force close
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it lets you work on or off line syncs to all devices an allows for collaborative sharing.  what more do you need from a mobile note app?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is everything everyone told me it was and more. Addictive and fun. I'm so glad I was finally able to get it on my kindle fire.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I would like to take the words from this book and string them around my throat to remind and comfort me of what is important in life and art.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I got this game for my little 2 year old niece can play & she loves it. Keeps her entertained.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Her voice is amazing. There's just nothing left to say. Kids aren't supposed to have vocal control like this.  Disney tries to manufacture this kind of performance, but this is amazing.  Lorde's vocals are soothing, soulful, natural.<br /><br />I've seen people on Reddit complain about the lack of sophistication in the instrumentation and the simple production values... I think it works exceptionally well. She's not an over-processed, producer-driven sound where her vocals have to compete with the backing music. It's really just her and the recoding engineer.  I like it.<br /><br />Although the subjects of her songs are definitely teenage, her ability to put into words the teenage experience shows talent and thoughtfulness beyond her years.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie! My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. We are usually pretty good at predicting what will happen during a movie, but this one had us guessing wrong!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Overall. I enjoyed this second book greatly. It is well-paced and Tyrion's stories were the highlight for me. If you enjoyed the setup in the first book, you'll get more payoff here.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|My 14 year old sister and I lost interest within the first 20 minutes and didn't even want to finish the movie. I felt like they were trying way too hard to make it funny when really it was just dumb! I loved the first movie and the second I thought was really funny as well, but this one was a joke!
B0055D3EOG|5.0|I wasnt expecting much and was pleasantly suprised.  I though this was a pretty darn good flick. Kind of an updated poltergiest.
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|I didn't like the fact that a young girl, 17, was shown taking pictures of herself naked to give to a man.  This event was presented in a positive light at the end of the movie when she gave the photos to a young boy.  The movie also gave a neutral to positive impression of one-night stands.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Great value for 3 games, especially Flower and Journey.<br />Journey is simply one of the best games I've ever played. It delivers an abstract feeling and emotion you would get from playing a hypothetical 'best game ever made'
1594744769|5.0|Wonderfully quirky twists and turns in this imaginative and orginal book.  In the beginning I had to read with &#34;one hand over my face&#34; because I am not into scary plots, but that soon gave way to wide-eyed wonderment at the marvelous story that was unfolding.  I had that familiar feeling as the pages dwindled down that I did not want this book to end and have to leave the magical world that the author had created.  I did not realize there was going to be a sequel until I came here to write a review and I am anxiously awaiting  the books delivery.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Great movie, scared the H*** out of me and I was holding on to my boyfriend the whole time. DATE NIGHT
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Lots of fun. Good graphics. Puzzles are challenging enough to keep interest, but not so hard you cannot figure out recommend to anyone who enjoys hidden object puzzle games.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|The game is great.I had been playing for months and had got to investigate the last picture,then the game froze.when I finally got it going I was back to the beginning.months down the pan.so starting again.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love the modernization of the xfiles genra. I look forward to seeing more. I accidentally skipped to season 5 and it was quite a change. looking forward to filling in the blanks.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I found the film gruesome and depressing. I do not find it entertaining to watch a story where people kill other people for sport. This film reflects the culture of death in which we live in. I would not recommend this film.
B00DVW908C|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. It is my favorite of the Doctor Who books I've read so far. It felt like a fair and good interpretation of the characters.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|If you love video game driving<br />It is AWESOME and is SUPER FUN  but it can get old so make shore you have some more fun games
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Yet another fascinating and thought provoking non fiction piece by Malcolm Gladwell. As an enormous fan of his work I was eager to read his newest book and it did not disappoint! Can't wait for his next book!!
B009P3N1GI|4.0|Brandon Sanderson once again comes up with a unique concept, expands on it, creates rich characters and sucks the reader right into this world.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|I RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE WHO CHERISHES GREAT QUALITY IN ACTING, DIRECTION, AND STORYLINE.  A REAL TRIBUTE TO A MOST IMPORTANT PERIOD OF HISTORY.
B000002KDO|4.0|This item was delivered quickly.  I bought this for a friend and he loves it.  I didn't give it 5 stars since the case it arrived in was cracked.  The CD played without a problem though.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I think its to challinging for me plus my dad even says he hatesit. its just awfull that's why I deleted it.  lot my kindle
B001H1SVO8|1.0|I didn't particularly like it. Fight Club wasn't my type of movie. I finally understand what people are talking about when they say &#34;the first rule of fight club is don't talk about fight club&#34; haha.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is a wonderful story of how the friendship between a man and a stray cat saved him from a life of addiction and despair.  I think Bob has got to be the smartest and most lovable cat I've ever heard of.  I couldn't stop reading and finished the story in one evening.  Everyone needs a friend like Bob!!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|We really like Cher's music and this CD didn't disappoint. It is of one of her live shows from the Farewell Tour -- wish I had a video of it. We were fortunate to see her at Staples Center with 2nd row seats
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I love this game so much! I just have a problem ; I cannot continue the game because every time I open the level that I have to do (the 2nd one in rattling bones)  the app crashes&hellip;<br />Other than that it's an amazing game!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Enjoyable, somewhat addictive game.  The sounds can be annoying, but help signal advanced threats. Flash back to the classic Middle Command. Solid, entertaining game.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story that connected the lives of two seemingly different people from two different eras in time.  Vivian's story is wonderfully written.
1476727651|5.0|If you've read 'The Shinning', this book is right up your alley. It seems to be a continuation of 'The Shinning' because much in it refers to that time. It is typical Stephen King, a book that you just can't seem to put down, one that makes you keep the lights on when you read it and your cell phone by your bedside in case you need help. Now, if Mr. King would only write 'The Cell - Part Two' or another part to 'Under the Dome'. Buy this book; you won't regret the money spent.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Fielding said Bridget had to be a singleton for this to work.  Wrong.  Fielding brilliantly navigated the singleton wonders and woes in the previous books.  That mine is empty. WHY, oh why,  did she feel the need to do a depressing replay of what worked so well two times before?<br /><br />I don't believe women -- in general -- really want younger men.  Hard body, undeveloped mind?  Not interesting to me.  But the biggest shame, to me, is that Fielding didn't bother to challenge herself to actually move Bridget along -- into the challenges, difficulties and rampant boredoms that lap at the shorelines of any long-term relationship.  Killing off a character doesn't make this great literature.  It makes this book a great bore.<br /><br />When the author killed off Mark (supposedly to show us that life doesn't always have happy endings) she killed off the spark that made Bridget's story work.  And, does Fielding really think that her readers thought any of Bridget's story was realistic in the first place?  I'll read Tolstoy or Edith Wharton if I want to encounter life's inevitable tragedies. I've had lots of heartache and loss in my own life since I first read Bridget's story and I did NOT need her...or Fielding...to show me that life doesn't always work out the way we want.<br /><br />How much more interesting this book could have been if the author had been willing to consider Bridget and Mark rediscovering each other, or facing some challenge coming from their very different personality styles.  Yes.  Bridget aged.  Well, so have I.  And I don't want to read about her being in the very same place she was when I first loved her.  It's just ugly, sad, and unfulfilling.  She was a modern-day Jane Austen heroine.  Now she's a parody of herself starring in a Keystone Cops version of maturity.  Bleh.  It's an insult to those of us who loved Bridget...and Mark.
1118109791|4.0|This book has a ton of questions that are helpful to practice. My recommendation is to start early - the more questions you make it through, the better!
B009D3CTVS|5.0|Works flawlessly and seems sturdy. Spend the money the first time, rather than buying multiple cheaper cables, it is well worth the investment
B00479SVBU|1.0|No reception in my car. Doesnt work. I tried a bunch of stations  and I have to manualy stop at the station and dont get any thing. Looks like it is working but not transmitting
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book was a bit choppy at times but in the end I really liked it. There was so many ups and downs in this book with Ender. You feel for him as you watch him grow and become someone completely different. I very much recommend this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I keep waiting for the story to end and Sylvia Day keeps entertaining me with more love, sex, compromise and heart wrenching truth of the characters lives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is the same as FB<br /> The graphics are better than FB<br /> Hope you get more KING Games<br />Keep them coming
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|It was a wonderful CD.  John Legend at his best.  I loved listening to it when I am doing my crafts.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I like this app very much<br />As soon as it uploaded without giving my location it gave me the weather conditions outside
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This app provides a clean and clear way to use wikipedia on kindle fire.  Each page loads quickly and the reader is able to easily sort information on every page.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It has BIG Numbers<br /> Easy to use<br /> Handy to have instead of fumbling to fine one elsewhere<br />And it is a FREE app
B008G12ERC|2.0|I'm not a fan of the bands new stuff. I was extremely disappointed. There sound is about the same but the lyrics are off. It's almost like they did a record just to put something out. I have been following muse since the 90's. Just extremely disappointed with the Album.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book and was so connected to the characters, that I found myself crying during some of their hardships.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Just discovered this show. I never knew it existed since I watched no television when it aired in 2003. It has a 'laugh out loud' funny scene in every episode. How could you not liove a sci-fi show like that? Wish there were more seasons...
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love this book!!! I couldn't put this book down until I had finished it, I recommend this book to every Percy Jackson fan there is, it is an upbeat fun book for everyone
1878424319|3.0|I find opahs reviews are usually just for sales purpose and this hold true. I could nit wait to receive the book since i am seeking a new way of living without depression.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is an amazing book I have recommend this book to all of my friends, their response to the book were like mine, if I could I would recommend this book to every Percy Jackson fan
B0000669JL|5.0|I always loved bob marley someone stole my original dics but now i have him again  nothing but the truth. Good relaxing music with a cause.
0316247545|5.0|love the book it is a definate asset to my little pony fans  it was  also great to find both seasons 1 and 2 at a great price . I would recommend buying the book and seasons 1 and 2 it makes a great gift set
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was thrilled when I finally saw that Candy Crush was available for the Kindle. The game is simple yet takes some strategy to make the right moves before time runs out.
B00D2PJQ96|5.0|This album is amazing! Every single song is a beautiful story. The lyrics and the melody are simply wonderful. I can listen to it a million of times.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|My heart is beating about a million miles an hour. I almost screamed when I realized I'd reached the end! Super engaging, action packed, and really leaves you wanting more!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very interesting as more and more applications will use this product. I'll be interested to see what this does in a year.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|I loved how Maude released her pain in her songs and I could kind of hear her voice in my head she has very powerful words and I am looking forward to the knew book.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was a great story, it felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone. It was a very good mystery that gave the reader just enough information to keep you interested but not quite enough to put all the pieces together. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who was a fan of the old Rod Serling series.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|over rated boring couldn't keep my interest I am not sure why everyone was making such a big deal about it. I hope the movie is better.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Another great album by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.<br /><br />In some regards, it feels like a &#34;dancy-er&#34; record, there are a lot of really good beats which are intertwined masterfully.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I ordered this mouse because I just started a new job where I'm using Adobe Premiere quite heavily, and I felt like the keyboard shortcuts for the cut tool, selection tool, and delete button were slowing my work down.  I ordered this mouse and set each of those to a side button, with copy and paste in place of the macro keys (the button above and below the scroll-wheel).<br /><br />I've had the mouse for about a week, and so far no complaints!  The key assignment in the software is very user-friendly, and you can assign and save keystroke profiles for the mouse button assignments.  Each profile also lets you choose a color, so you know which profile you're using, or you can just pick the one that looks cool to you.  So far I feel it's really cut out an unnecessary step by looking for the \\"c\\", \\"v\\", and \\"delete\\" keys when I want to make a cut in Premiere.<br /><br />As far as the structure of the mouse, it feels very comfortable to my hand after a few days of getting used to it from my old generic logitech mouse.  The buttons and piece where your palm rests are a very nice rubberized material, and the thumb-rest on the side is a nice smooth rubber.  It could stand to have a bit more weight, but that's not a huge issue for me, just a preference.  My only downside I've noticed so far is that the three side buttons are attached as one in the mouse, and they wiggle around in the hole routed out for them.  This hasn't affected my use of the mouse yet, I only fear it may be a durability issue down the road.<br /><br />For the price, the quality on this thing is great in my opinion.  If you need a mini-keyboard on the side of your mouse, this isn't the one for you, but if you have a few core functions in a game or program you use often that you'd feel would serve you better on the side of a mouse rather than in random places on the keyboard, then the Anker would be a great peripheral to pick up.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|Great for fans of Meshuggah, Animals as Leaders, and such.<br /><br />The guitar work is pristine, vocals are great, and the rhythm section is on point.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have the trilogy books in paperback, loved it so much I purchased the ebooks. Read it 11 times already and still going! Can't wait for the movies to come out:)
B008PZ69T8|4.0|Excellent selection  of music  and very relaxing. I would recommend this classical album to anyone looking for alone time relaxation, or quiet moments with someone.
0756407915|5.0|This book is an amazing continuation to the wonderful The Name of the Wind. The world it depicts is described thoroughly enabling the reader to imagine every single detail, character and situation. Characters are well rounded and needed to develop the storyline. One of the best indicators of how well written and thought out this book really is, was all those moments in which I felt totally related to Kvothe's life. I was transported into a dream world sensing real emotions in every event.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best books I have read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy after all the imitation boot leg copy cat candy apps, cc is finally on kindle.<br />so far so good. haven run in to any issues with the app!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|After becoming addicted to Candy Crush thought this was worth a try.  The instructions say aim then tap to shoot.  It shoots while aiming so often it's nearly impossible to play.
160459201X|5.0|This information about your subconscious mind is interesting and very useful.  Joseph Murphy, accomplished an educational book that really reassures us that life for us has infinite possibilities.  We are in control of our happiness that thoughts become things.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|10000000000000 stars!<br /><br />I love this book because it has so many different things. Romance, a little bit of comedy, action, adventure. This is probably the best book I have ever read. I think everyone should read this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|SO GLAD TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO PLAY ON MY KINDLE FIRE<br />AND IT'S A FREE APP!  Thanks to the developer and Amazon for making it possible
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept my attention throughout the book, great writing and dramatic story. The plot was interesting and filled with so many twists and turns..
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was the fastest book I have read lately due to the authors writing style..and boy can he write a surprise ending
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so alsome. I recommend candy crush 2 everyone! best game ever made. its so addictive! I play it all the time!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Very nice game. It also is good because it tries to teach people about the dangers of been stupid and careless around trains or in certain situations that imply danger. Everyone should try it.
B009POHHRG|5.0|Amazing joker story. Very dark and well written. I just wish it would have been a longer read. Still great.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I loved every NIN album up to With Teeth. The Slip and Year Zero had great moments, but wasn't strong all the way through like the previous albums had been for me. Hesitation Marks shows that Trent became better at editing himself and keeping his best moments and focusing on a few great songs. Some fans may not like remixes, but I thoroughly enjoyed all three remixes as they reimagined the songs and didn't simply add a dance beat to them.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book can change people's lives...it is so simple to do the experiments but the effects are profound. A real paradigm shifter. Highly recommend.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie is amazing, recommend it to any sci-fi or action fans out there! Great action sequences and story as well as awesome rendering of Judge Dredd in his true form. The shipping was fast and the product quality is on point.
1408803011|5.0|I really enjoyed Fantastic Beadts and Where to Find Them!I love how it was Harry's book and he wrote in it. I finished the Harry potter series and Gantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them really fed my Harry Potter craving.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thank you so much , finally candy crush is out on the kindle, i am  so hook on this damn game
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've only started reading this book, but I am very pleased.  The main characters are familiar to me because they are from King's famous novel, &#34;The Shining&#34;.  New characters are in there, too, but I was pleased to be able to jump into the story so quickly because of the familiar characters.  I think this is going to be very good....
B0058UXHHK|4.0|The book was Interesting and different so it kept my attention as the plot progressed. I liked the suspense, overall mystery  and change in the story as it unfolded.
B00DVPN30A|1.0|Not the Amos L we love... It just does not quite make it to the same level<br />Listen to it BEFORE you buy it
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love Pinterest and think it is perfect for mobile. The problem I have is that after I had been using it for awhile the quick picks at the top stopped working. I deleted it from Kindle and reloaded it, but that only worked the first time; it has not solved the problem since it reappeared.<br /><br />Also, I have found that when I keep following a pin to another page and another and so on, it becomes more difficult to select a pin. I'll click on it, the page will freeze, and then IL be sent to my original page, and unless I remember the exact trail I took I can't get back to that pin. Similarly, if I follow a long trail and try to pin something it will freeze. However if I click the back button that often solves that problem.<br /><br />All that said, I love Pinterest enough to use it with all the annoying glitches.
1559409002|5.0|There's no sex. There's no violence. There's none of the goofy stuff that you'd expect in a  low-budget film. But this one shines above the best of it's genre, high-end Hollywood included. It's scares in a way that the monsters and gore can never hope to match.<br /><br />The story moves along quickly, the intrigue growing with each scene. It is mysterious and dark, like a haunting nightmare. There are no surprise answers, no silly explanations of the events that unfold. Rather, the writer and producer - brilliantly, in my opinion - leave interpretation to the viewer's imagination.<br /><br />Whereas most movies are a story in search of a setting, this one was inspired entirely by the location in which the main parts of the film were shot. The plot - well, it just fit into the scenery. And what a perfect fit! What a magnificent backdrop! What a truly amazing viewing experience! (I've watched it at least 40 times and still counting.)<br /><br />Unlike other editions of this cult classic, the video on the Criterion version is as clear is if they'd shot the black and white just yesterday. The accompanying features are fascinating and well worth buying. How did the actors get picked?. Who exactly are they? What are they doing now? You get all that and more. Maybe the same irony will impress others. A couple of seasoned actors appear in the film, and yet the unknowns seem the better in their parts. And the story of the film's making is nothing less than engrossing.<br /><br />Recommended highly to anyone who likes independent films, mystery, and real art in the cinema.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I really wish they made more movies like this one. My wife and I enjoyed this from the very beginning to the very end. Amazing, highly recommended flick for anyone who enjoys sci-fi with a manga twist. Just please make sure you have an epic sound system before watching this movie!!
B00DM0UTPQ|4.0|We like Ed Harris, so we watched this via Amazon, not knowing what to expect. Turns out it's about a Russian submarine crew... so it was a bit strange at first, watching all these American actors play Russians, but speaking English . But, the story was good (apparently it's based on an actual incident), and so was the acting. We enjoyed it.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Wasn't too interested in watching this movie but oh, was I pleasantly surprised! It's a really great story & the voices fit the characters beautifully! My grand kids & I love watching this over & over again!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Love it!! A must have.  I waited for the Blu ray only had it on VHS.  GET IT NOW!!!! Yes yes.
B000000OU0|5.0|Anyone that knows me, knows that I'm not particularly fond of live music CDs.....but this one is definitely an exception!! Not only did they NOT  warp the songs we've grown to love, but they made them sound even better- & I didn't think that was possible!
B008PQ8XZK|4.0|Good read , not a predictable ending . Not a suspense page turner but nevertheless a good plot and story
0316228583|2.0|I felt like washing my hands whenever I put it down. It makes every character look bad, weak or malicious. The only one treated sympathetically dies in the opening scene. She can do better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Handy Crush is  my all-time favorite  game ever since it came out and I am so  HAPPY that it's on kindle yey
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love it, enjoy being able to wait for lives to build back up, no need  to keep spending money. Wish more games were like this.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|It works very well, snaps on magnetically like a charm, I just don't feel that the $10 price is worth it. Maybe for $5 it'd be worth it, but I purchased it because I needed an adapter for my old magsafe 1 power adapter.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game,good gameplay,it froze as soon as I turned it on.It took like 10 mins to reload my whole kindle.they need to fix it.all in all,good game<br /><br />.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|After trying out a few of the third party controllers I finally came back to the original source. The third party ones just don't work or feel the same as the original. The price was fairly hefty, but it is flawless!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a truly amazing book. It made my feel like I was five years old again. I loved it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Started to install and Lookout immediately notified that this is adware. I removed it as quickly as possible. Will avoid this developer.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I read some reviews and thought this game might just be hyped up by developer flunkies but surprise to see this game is the s*** in a twisted sort way. I've not been so challenged in quite some time now and it's good to see a game that I have to adapt to and strategically plan out an end all for the world.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Well I absolutely love Susan Boyle so you can expect that I will give her and Standing Ovation five stars. Also it is wonderful that she is now dressed as a star. Ena
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Okay but didn't find anything i was looking for just found words I already know so i didn't like it
B003XRELGQ|5.0|An amazing satire.  I have heard of Kurt Vonnegut for decades but never got around to reading any of his work.  Very much worth the time.  Satirical, facetious, funny, and thought provoking.  I plan to read more of Vonnegut.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|never ever played the game so i had a passing knowledge of what went on so perhaps that is a good thing?  i thought the CGI was very good and most of the acting believable.<br /><br />i caught this on my Amazon Prime video and don't know if there are others but i would recommend this to anyone who likes a bit of Sci-Fi.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Actually I've been waiting for this kind of show for a long time and I fell in love with it the first time and until now. Love it how everything is put together.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much, Amazon (and Jeff Besos)for finally making this game available for Kindle Fire!  This is one of the best games of all time (in this genre) and I was getting tired of having to play it on my laptop.  I had been feeling kind of cool toward the new Kindle Fire HDX simply because there are apps like this that I want and have been unable to get from Amazon, so spending so much for the Kindle Fire HDX did not seem worthwhile.  I am going to have to reconsider that, if Amazon continues to provide the games I want to play.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Want to know what the weather is going to be like for today or the next five days and don't want to turn on the TV and wait for coverage in your area? Then this nifty little app, which uses GPS location, will tell you what the weather is going to be like hour-by-hour for the current day and give you short discriptions of what it woilol be like for the next five days to come. Just remember that nyou need to be in a wifi area for this app to work correctly. Pefecttly good free app.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works very well with the adapter that I ordered. No problem. Works so much better  than the cable I have had for my Kindle Fire.
B004SBX112|3.0|It is good but too many adds. I got tired of always having the adds come up after every change of the scene. Bought the game instead!!!
B006GWO5NE|2.0|I called Amazon because I have difficulty charging my Kindle.  They sent me this to fix the problem I was having.  I have to twist the cord tightly down to get the Kindle to charge.  This cord works the same as the last cord I had.  With the &#34;Amazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adapter for Accelerated Charging&#34;  the problem is slightly better.  It is still a pain to charge the Kindle.  I still have to twist and pull the cord and set the kindle in a perfect position to get it to charge.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|This is what bodybuilding was all about when it was full of men not overly large freaks of nature who fill themselves with odd &#34;additives&#34;...a truely inspirational movie.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked Misremembered Man because it was a little Ireland.  Life in Ireland and the life of a family living in Ireland.  The language was interesting, how it was written.  The story had a nice twist!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It was OK.  I'm glad I was able to view it on Prime rather than go see it in the theater or buy the movie.  I think this movie is probably enjoyed more by a younger audience.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Probably close to one of the most &#34;unique&#34; films I've ever seen but  that's exactly what made it so enjoyable. The first time watching I was indifferent throughout the film. I didn't exactly know what to think. But after it ended and had a chance to simmer, I was impelled to share with others and re-watch again. Definitely see this with friends or family. It only betters the experience.<br /><br />Great story-line, creative film and overall a phenomenal cast. The 1960's style filming was genius and the comedy was perfect! If you haven't, be sure and add this to your Must See list.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|All I can say is read it.  Loved this book.  Great for teenagers to adults.  After you read it pass it on.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is one of the most underrated and undeservedly slandered films I've seen.  This one boldy marches right up and sits right down beside Star Wars and other like time-tested, sci-fi 'space operas'.  Plus, this one has the added degree of being distilled from one of the earliest sci-fi classics by Burroughs.  As such, it can claim a somewhat unique plot line and scope, which I will not spoil for the potential newcomer.<br /><br />I gave it five stars, which is, in this case, 4.5 stars rounded up.  I would spare it half a star in agreement with some of the other comments about scripting.  It does get somewhat predictable.  Along with that, I found Taylor Kitsch's delivery a little juvenile and overdone.  His cockiness gets a little tiring.  Still, he is a good choice and a new face.<br /><br />Other than that, it really is a visual feast worthy of Lucas, Spielberg, Scott, et al.  The action sequences and CGI are spectacular and, happily, only improve in scale and depth as the film progresses.  Lynn Collins is an excellent choice for Dejah Thoris, and is stunning to behold in this exotic role; her appearances never go unnoticed....<br /><br />I can only echo the other pleas here for Disney to look past the box office performance and let the growing fan following of this film persuade them to continue the franchise.  It would be a great opportunity for Disney to add their own mark to the sci-fi genre, having such a strong and definitive opener with 'John Carter'.  Burroughs wrote plenty more material in this particular universe to be mined - it would be a shame to not see what happens next to John Carter and Dejah Thoris.  The fantasy is all the more fun contrasted with the new knowledge from the ongoing explorations of Mars.  Come on, Disney, let's go back to Barsoom.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Very addictive. I have enjoyed this since I down loaded it from the app store earlier today. I couldn't stop playing it.
B000GOUMPI|4.0|A well-crafted film that still delivers. The acting and setting combine to tell a scary tale of a haunting set in a classic marital power struggle.
B000OVLINI|4.0|Recommended in my reading group. Mathis book is suspenseful without all kinds of twist and turns. Definitely a page turner! Loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive ...I was thrilled when it finally came available on the Kindle Fire...thanks for such a fun game! !!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I very nice read, romantic novel. It does shed light on how domestic violence can effect so many lives. Good perspective from both sides.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thought this game was gonna suck. Now I can't stop playing. I think the game is sending crack through some type of invisible rays that go thru your eyes and into it your  nervous system. Addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome as ever. Glad to finally see it on kindle!!!!!! This is the best I have seen it look out of all the formats that I have played it on.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|Just finished!Fantastic read!Not to long at all.Great story line.You can figure out the end pretty easy but well worth the read.Hope you take the time for this one.Happy reading!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a deep and very moving book, exceedingly well written. All the characters were developed so that I got to know each one well and their relevance to the story, as a whole. I read on the treadmill and couldn't wait to hop on to continue reading everyday -- I lost three more pounds because there were days when I read beyond my hour!!!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|this movie is grate lots of hart and love for your mind go rent ore by this movie its grate its good for familys.
B000FC146C|5.0|I've had a hardback copy of the book since shortly after it was published.  I've read that twice.  I recently downloaded it onto my Kindle (phone) so I can enjoy it whenever I have just a moment or two.  It has adventure, drama and a love story.  I love every character in the book.
0316074314|5.0|The five stars are for what I could read of the book.<br />It appears, Little Brown, the publisher,bound and printed my copy of the book missing 21 pages in the middle!<br /><br />Would love to have a whole copy!
1476727651|5.0|Doctor Sleep is an entertaining sequel centering around a hero and side-kick versus an evil army with a villainous leader. I recommend any King fan to read this long overdue sequel.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive. A great game to play in the middle of the night when you can't sleep. Love this game!
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Got this as a free app of the day on Amazon but it is one of the few games I would have paid for.  The cartoonish graphics and wonderful little animations are icing on the cake and look great on my Kindle Fire HD.  The levels start off very easy, but still entertaining, and get progressively more complex but not at a frustrating level like some similar games I've played.  This game is appropriate for any age level but might be a little difficult for young children.  In conclusion, great graphics, sound, story, and game controls make this little game a rare gem that I highly recommend.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|I have just fallen in love with music that Hans Zimmer composes.  This soundtrack is no exception.  It starts of a little slow, and is considerably different from some of his other soundtracks.  I really enjoy the song; What Are You Going To Do When You Are Not Saving The World.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|so addictive!! been playing for some time and have yet to get bored. So many different levels to get through, you just want to keep going!
B004OBZMBS|5.0|This is sleeper movie ( so was Robocop )- what i mean is - you will have a real blast watching this.<br />This is word of mouth - Buy and watch it - you be be surprised. Had enough of Bullzhit Zombies ? - then this<br />is the movie for you. Buy from these guys.
B003CGOXR0|5.0|Adults come to deal with the hidden subconscious memories of childhood.  A wonderfully evocative novel about the deep troubles of childhood in the 1950s.  A timeless classic by one of the best storytellers of all time.  Read it as a psychological thriller rather than a horror story.  King is always more than he appears.
1933952806|4.0|The Nikon D7000 is a great camera, but complex.  The factory manual is complete, and also read difficult to<br />follow because the subjects are scattered and not clearly written.  This book by D. Young is quite complete<br />and very well illustrated.  The organization is good, and each subject is kept together and is also well<br />cross referenced.<br />The writting style is verbose, with a lot of redundant stuffing that is distracting.  A concise &#34;How To Do&#34; a task would<br />have been most useful.<br />Even so, it is a good book, and much better that the factory manual and also better than competing books.  I just<br />wish it was concisely written, as if it was one third as long it would be much easier to read, and just as useful
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|In the modern world Shakespeare only works if we fit the best of him to what is there,we need to cut away the great seas of rhetoric and go with the flow.Get an ensemble of working actors who are at ease with each other, working in unison on productions of different material made for TV and film(as here)and just film them over 10 days in one setting.What does Shakespeare need to be realized now and be seen by a mass audience of youth who would not otherwise see him? Why,update him and show how relevant he is.So examples we've seen like Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet,McKellen's Richard III,Fiennes's Coriolanus,Branagh's Henry V have shown us what can be done.Are we aiming for `realism'? No.We can get to imaginative truth,say by shooting in black and white.Whedon has got an enviable experience of moulding a company of actors in his Firefly or Buffy TV productions.He's rehearsed with them many times.He filmed MAAN in his home estate,with the great help of his wife's production.Shakespeare `was not for an age,but for all time',but maybe he never wrote as if for eternity,he wrote living dramas to be performed for 1 or 2 years only before he moved onto the next one.If it doesn't live in the present it doesn't live at all.<br /><br />We never fully understand Shakespeare,but we get closer to him by performing his rich tapestries of language, freighted with human emotion.The language is only archaic if its not spoken;familiarity is what we need.Whedon started filming this a week after finishing The Avengers Assemble.Directed on a low budget with a cast of friends and colleagues whom he'd got round to his house for regular readings of Shakespeare.They rehearsed this first.This romance involves a cruel con-trick and a startling murder sub-plot.MAAN anticipates the shift of tone and genre of modern cinema.This modern LA version is set in a gated community of the sparring between Beatrice and Benedict,who hate each other until he's tricked into believing she loves him,she overhears Hero and her maid discussing his love for her.The play is a template for the modern rom-com:hate,followed by shenaningans,then falling in love.<br /><br />Whedon has kept the original verse.Everything is perfectly comprehensible and still funny.We could be watching a US-sitcom.It's refreshing,you can understand all the jokes here.There is a sudden change of mood,when Beatrice asks Benedict to kill Claudio,after her outrage at his treatment of Hero,to prove Benedict's love for her. Magically, Whedon's approach is effortless.He's not in awe of the text,he's known for his wit and wordplay(cf.Buffy).The film is not perfect: we're not really sure what they're doing there;you're never sure of the soldiery/war context(are they corporate bosses/mafia hitmen?).Don John is the villain and fits in with a tale of deception/double-cross in a comedy-noir in this b/w film. He is exposed by the fumbling and incompetent constable, Dogberry(Fillion,great).We don't get a sense of the whole plot as in Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet,but this doesn't need to suck up to youth as that did.This is for the 30+ audience.Whedon is good with female characters and crafts a fluent,contemporary story in the large Spanish-style house good for visual twists and physical play with many corners and stairs.Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof are incredible as the barbed pair.Music by Whedon
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I primarily use it to read library books that have lots of illustrations or links.<br />Pros:<br />--Makes it possible to see pictures that often aren't shown in e-pub versions of books.<br />--Makes it possible to link to outside content.<br />Cons:<br />--Awkward checkout process (have to go to Amazon account to check out, then do a sync to download book)<br />--Awkward return process (have to go to Amazon account to return/delete, slow, then delete from Android separately)<br />--Working with items in Amazon account not excessively easy, often slow.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once  again, a greatly written book.  King is my favorite... never a dull moment... highly  recommend...  this is why he's the master..
B009AMAJVO|3.0|Pretty good movie. The suspense and action are pretty good. The love story could have been more intense and more adult, and not so PG, considering this isn't a movie for kids. They made the violence good, but the chemistry between Noomi and Collin fizzled every time they got together and there was any chance of something going on between them! Long story short in that department: Builds the suspense up, but never delivers. Let down!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so thrilled this game is now on kindle fire! It is fun and addicting! Just be careful about all the extras you can buy it adds up fast!

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Brilliant, breathtaking fast-paced, high adventure focuses on 16 year old Nathan Ryder, living in \\"small town\\" Oregon, whose \\"outviews\\" (flashbacks to past lives while awake and asleep) torment him to thoughts of insanity, his older brother who has already been \\"committed\\" by his mother into a life of drugged subsistence, the discovery that his father was murdered, an outcast psychic aunt who is keeping his brother alive, and a cast of supporting characters who are all-of-a-sudden awash in a government conspiracy to eradicate them all.<br /><br />The author combines a heavy storyline with weighty ancient concepts (some with new names) of soul travel and inner space, remote viewing, reincarnation, single souls living simultaneous lives on the earth plane and in other universes, bilocation, astral projection, healing energy orbs, dimensional doorways: vortexes, portals, pathways... and the lust for power, corrupt government, humanity's greed, and murder...<br /><br />As young Nate struggles to instantaneously discover and wield his extraordinary powers to defend himself and, possibly the planet, he is taught...\\"The long-forgotten powers of the soul are the inspiration for all the magic that has ever been...everything can change in an instant. Truly, it is possible to learn everything that has ever been known in just an instant...if you can get yourself to a certain point, it could be... Every time we make a step we are moving with all the cosmos, and all our ancestors move and take steps with us.\\"<br /><br />The scope of this book is phenomenal, written with such depth and dimension that you may be led to question your own concept of reality... It was a struggle for me to write this review. I was sorely tempted to just continue on to Brandt Legg's second book in this series [[ASIN:B00DIMXTBO Outin (The Inner Movement)]]<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|A couple unexpected turns pulled me into the ridiculous story more than I anticipated. Add in some over-the-top action and you're in for a fun ride. Great cast.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|You know how it will turn out, but it gives a different way of getting there than many others, and the action scenes are pretty cool.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Formula story-line with some good action. No big surprises but fun to watch with a good supporting cast. Good home rental.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This was a great book. The Netflix show is  extremely entertaining. After watching the first season....I was very interested in finding out the rest of the story.
B004D1CK32|5.0|Its long but the film takes it time building the characters and the plot.  Very well done and a must see for fans of classic films and history buffs alike.
0992251656|4.0|Preface: I have only played 1 game so far and it took 4 hours.  BUT, much of that was just getting the hang of things.  Towards the end, we were flipping and resolving cards very quickly.<br /><br />Quick rundown: You take jobs, you do jobs, you get paid for the jobs.  And keep your boat in the sky.  Take some nice cushy legal jobs in the Alliance areas?  Take something riskier or worry about getting caught by an Alliance patrol?  Or really go out into the boarders, make some real money but risk the wrath of Reavers?<br /><br />Buy some gear.  Vera?  The Mule?  How about a Cunning Hat?  Hire some crew.  Inara can help you talk your way out of some situations.  Kalee can keep your boat in the sky.  Did you pick up Saffron?  Well she just jumped ship to work on another ship as Yolanda.<br /><br />The Good: I felt like I was in the show.  I could take risks for big pay, but get caught.  I could play it safe and stay out of major space lanes and hope not to run out of gas.  When Reavers were nearby, we crapped our pants.  And in terms of game mechanics, we felt like when bad things happened it was our choice. And once you learn what to do, things flow nicely.  Also, all of the parts are decent quality at worse, with some (like the money) being wonderful.  Also, did I mention that my Captain, Monty, wore a mighty cunning hat till the end of the game.<br /><br />The Bad: Lots and LOTS of bits and baubles.  There are 13 separate decks, each with their own discard piles. 5 piles of tokens.  And 5 stacks of very well printed money.  Add to that a big board and each player needing real estate for their ship, crew, gear, jobs, and money...this game takes some serious room to play.  This wasn't really a concern to me, but I know it may be for some folks.  Also, there were w few niggling rules issues we weren't sure about.  Or how or when you can cancel an active job.  Hopefully a FAQ will clear them up.<br /><br />The Ugly: Doing jobs for Niska.  Yeah, I didn't have to...but Iwanted to be Solid with him.  And he made me pick up (read: Capture) some slaves and deliver them.  Yeah the pay was damn good...but I still felt dirty.
B00846TTDG|4.0|The film does a great job of portraying what our nation's finest are like and made me grateful to have such dedicated professionals watching out for us.  Authentic action and a palpable sense of brotherhood make this film uniquely appealing.
1451695195|5.0|I have not been able to put this book down.  It is so well written and very captivating.  It is very inspirational,heartwarming and worth every red cent.
B008DYZKQE|2.0|The story seems to be about snubbing a bratty prince, and being clever, but it's really not that clever. Furthermore, the Kindle version has some serious tech issues, with the pics disappearing from time to time on iPad.
B0053R1QXU|4.0|A classic and well-executed thriller. This movie has a great plot and great pacing, it never drags at all. Al Pacino and Robin Williams give especially good performances, in my opinion. Hillary Swank's performance is a little less than stellar, possibly due to the cliched character traits.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Don't know what all the fuss was about. This is a silly book. Chick lit at its facile worst. Don't waste your money or time.

B00CABLXU8|5.0|I love their song &#34;Wings&#34;, so I bought the entire cd hoping to find more great songs from Little Mix.  This deluxe US version DID NOT DISAPPOINT!  Most of the tracks are great!  My most favorite tracks are &#34;Wings&#34;, &#34;Turn Your Face&#34;, and &#34;How Ya Doin&#34;.  Out of 16 tracks, there were only 2 that I didn't really care for.  One of them being their acoustic version of &#34;We Are Young&#34;.  Their version of this song should NOT have been added to this album. The arrangement was terrible, and each one tried too hard to sound good. It just didn't work.  I am thankful that the 2 songs I dislike are the last 2 tracks on the cd.  As far as I'm concerned, the cd ends at track 14.<br /><br />So, 14 great tracks out of 16.... Great job Little Mix!  Hope your next cd is just as good.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It's been a long time since a book has really changed the way I think about anything like this book has. It is full of revelations about a religion and a man that are so important & influential & done in a way that I really didn't want to put the book down. Each chapter was filled with important and relevant information about the man Jesus was and the environment he grew up in and his influences and his successors. It really changed the way i understand Christianity & it's founder. Really well done
B001MTENOC|5.0|My mind has shifted thanks to this book. How I have not known about it until 40 years of age amazes me.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So excited to find this game for the kindle fire because it is a ton of fun. I am  disappointed to find that you can either pay to unlock levels, link it to a Facebook (no thanks), or complete 3 quests BUT you have to wait 24 hours between quests?! That's an awfully long time to wait to play... why not be 30 minutes like waiting for lives? There is no way I am paying to continue playing...

0770437400|5.0|You've probably heard about zombies sometime before this review, if not let me tell you about this book \\"World War Z\\".The author of this book is Max Brooks who is also known for his other zombie based book \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\". I bought this book while I was on the road in Texas to pass the time while driving with my mom back home, amazingly it did the trick. This novel centers around the interviews with survivors who have endured almost hellish survivor life after a disease that reanimates the dead plagues nearly the entire earth. Brooks describes in near detail some of the most intense as well as emotional encounters with the undead, whether it be someone the survivor knew or just met. The interviews take place all over the world from the United States all the way to eastern Europe. It has been nearly ten years since the first outbreaks have occurred when these interviews are taken and it is explained that many of the survivors have changed since that time, some better than others in health. In ever chapter interview there is always some sort of encounter with the walking corpses from being face to face or knowing there just beyond the next wall.<br />  What I really enjoyed about this book is the variety of stories told form different points of view, from a soldier form Russia,an American pilot flying over Colorado,an Israeli civilian ,a surgeon who worked in Rio,to a Wisconsin teenager girl who moved north to Canada with her parents only to still find zombies. With each interview added a little more insight to the whole story and how this disease affected the world emotionally,mentally and even politically, I say politically because there is a conspiracy behind the origin of this disease but that is all I am going to say about that. There would be some endings to certain chapters that I didn't like as much as others but I guess not everything can be happy in an ending in a zombie infested world. There are also certain details that could be a little gruesome but does add to the detail of the books description.<br />  I believe in the end the book was worth the fourteen dollars and that it is in fact a good read. I would have to suggest buying this book only because it mainly deals with zombies and how these different people from all over the world dealt with the situation, some good some bad. If your a fan of zombies I believe you will fall in love with this book with great interest and for those who are not fans of zombies or just do not like horror in general I would say try something new, try World War Z. To be honest reading this book would at least be better than doing nothing with your spare time. I'm sure if given a chance it could be a great book to other people like it did for me.

B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|True to Bridget form, Helen Fielding works her magic in this tragic yet spellbinding third installment of Bridget's story.  We are faced with the tragic loss of not one, but two key characters in Bridget's life, and still kept guessing what wonderous good could come from it.  I literally devoured it in one sitting, and was left with tears and laughter and a deep love for my favorite character once again. From 'twunking' to sausages, Bridget remains the same wonderfully hopeless heroine we fell in love with.<br /><br />**************IF YOU HAVENT READ IT YET DO NOT READ REMAINDER OF REVIEW*************<br />Stephen King once said for a great story, you must 'kill your darlings.'  Unfortunately for Bridget fans, this means the undiscribable loss of Mark. Helen Fielding explores the effects of loss during marriage and parenting after tragedy, parental loss (I was almost equally saddened by the loss of Bridget's father Colin.) and coming to terms with being 'of a certain age.' I found this book wildly tragic, yet beautiful.  We are left with tears, yet gladdened for our Bridget's everlasting optimism and ending with hope renewed for our favorite girl.<br /><br />In the end, I laughed heartily, cried unashamedly, and cheered for my beloved Bridget. True fans will love this book. End of story.

B00CPWTRAA|3.0|. . . but, let's face it, not great either.  I can easily believe that, on the stage, with his well-developed histrionic gifts, Domingo can still be effective in the Verdi baritone roles, for the voice has still some warmth and beauty, but it has lost its distinctiveness and, under pressure, some of its firmness too.  Perhaps it is remarkable singing for a man of 70+, but if we measure him against Cappuccilli or Bruson or Gobbi in their primes, then the limitations are apparent and the microphone is pretty merciless.  The one unqualified success here, to my ears, is \\"Di Provenza il mar\\" -- beautifully voiced, and sung with an attention to dynamics that seems absent from the other selections, where the voice comes at you at never less than a pleasant mezzo-forte.  I expected more particularly from the \\"Boccanegra\\" scene, but it's messy here, and the balancing doesn't help.  Also, in general, too often the orchestra seems too recessed and the voice a bit too forward.  It's far from a total disaster, but honestly, this program doesn't merit a CD to itself.  Domingo was a wonderful tenor, and he has preserved his voice admirably, but this one is a bit sad.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Regardless of your opinion of individual performances or of minor idiosyncrasies of plotting, this series as a whole does not fail to hold your attention, and continues to surprise the viewer. At times, you are left to wonder, not whether these things will happen, but when they will, or more chillingly, when they did. This  reviewer has viewed Season One in its entirety, and now Season Two. Highly recommended.
B008Y212PI|5.0|When I first played this game I was a little sceptical about playing it.<br />My friends daughter started playing and started to play.  In fact after watching her play I decided to try it once again and loved it !!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've had to side load candy crush with the good e-reader appstore. And now I have the real thing. Thank you amazon ever though it took you forever to get candy crush saga.
0321928482|1.0|This book was written by experts at Adobe, who have no idea of what the user needs. I found this book useless and full of technical terms that I have no idea about what they are saying. I am stuck on the FIRST lesson.<br />Tom Walsh
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|love these mind puzzles...have this soothing background music as I am losing my mind with these perplexing puzzles...eventually the light bulb clicks &amp; have a sense of accomplishment
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's a good app and entertaining. I downloaded the app now I understand a lot more of the texts I get
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Another great book from  stephen king !  Almost back to his best ..... he just needs a. It sequel next
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, love it, love it. I love Bubble Witch Saga but this ranks right there with it. So glad it is finally on Kindle Fire. Thanks King for all your great games.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I was not impressed with this game.  Game kept locking up and slowing down.  Uninstalled and reinstalled but still no success.  Thank God this one was free or I would be requesting a refund.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|everyone must have...it is fun and it's hard to put down.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I made one small change in my financial habits based on Robert's book, and it made a dramatic difference in my finances. Thank you Robert Kiyosaki.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is totally engrossing...I have to discipline myself and be patient for the next level. Love me some Candy Crush!!!
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is a fun and addicting game. The graphics are so cool. You can play this game for hours without evening knowing it. It's that addicting!
B000002W9Q|1.0|The cd was not a COMPLETE sound track.  Just a small portion.  Could be considered &#34;false advertising&#34;. I was very disappointed that there  was just a small portion of the music on this cd
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My sons both love this set, and the quality is great.  We would buy the other sets but Lego has gotten stupidly expensive lately.
B0000DIXDR|2.0|Horrible purchase first cd would stop with approximately 30 more minutes of the movie to go.  The 2nd cd Amazon sent to me resulted in the same way.  Finally I purchased on at Best Buy and it works perfect.  This wan given as a gift and I will never use Amazon again for gift giving.
B00005NB8K|5.0|A nostalgic movie about Jimmy Morrison and the Doors.  Fun to watch if you lived in the 60's or if you are just  curious about the music of that time.  Val Kilmer did a great job of portraying Morrison.  : )
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|One of the most enjoyable CD's I have ever purchased.  You don't want to stop listening to it. This cd gives you so much.  If you need to relax....this is the best cd ever
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Great range of vocals & music with a window  into Tyler Joseph  life's journey through his songwriting. Tyler songs underlying meaning is that he survives only through his belief in God and he embraces it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's been long time coming and your here LOVE this game so much no time like the present WELCOME to Amazon kindle fire
B004UJAOLM|5.0|A great read of an old classic.  Sort of a possibly super natural strange love story which<br />took part during a time when people did not stray much from their birthplace.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|As someone else pointed out in his review, sound selection is great however it is a potty it does not play as background. Whenever it does, it would 've a hit!
B00BQHA06A|5.0|HIM Rawks!!! \m/ \m/ A lil ol' school & a lil new....alwayz HIM Alwayz hits the mark!! Love Metal Rocks!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am completely knocked out by this book. I couldn't stop reading it. I wish it would just go on and on. Please! Write more.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book, especially with death as the protagonist.  It is a real roller coaster ride. Give yourself a treat and read this one!
B002Q7JYPC|2.0|Poor writing on this album will only cause me to listen to it once! Save your money guys and buy something else.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|Miley cyrus is a slut that is ugly and that don't make good music at all.  She's used to be decent.  But now she took it to a whole far.  Even taylor swift is smut.  Eww this music industry is ruined forever.  Jesus.... :(
0156027321|2.0|The first part of the book dragged on, with very little action to keep one interested. Once Pi was in the boat with his animals, the story picked up, as did my interest. At times, it was even wonderful. But I get mighty bent when an author, after leaving clue after clue to a puzzle, then \\"TELLS\\" me the answer...and then REPEATS the answer, (the animals identities), as if I, the reader, were a moron and couldn't figure it out for myself. (Or couldn't understand it the first time the author outright revealed it.) That said, my daughter, a UCSD graduate, told me that she missed the connection. Had the author not stated it, she wouldn't have known. Maybe she's in good company...because it became popular enough to become a movie.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|this is an ok game. slow pace. nice challenging games and searches but the pace is slow with very little to no interaction with other players. to get extra play time cost more real money than most other. games I play. I mainly play while my other games are re-intergizing.
B00B2166BS|3.0|It works, and the charging with it is better than the charger supplied with my nexus 10.  That said, not sure I like the magnetic connection as it pops off too easily especially if I am trying to use the tablet at the same time.
B00EZYU8C2|5.0|Yes, it was one of the perfect serial performance as the final session....But still waiting for B2 -2 format of blu ray version in english<br />under prints with the addition of extras.....Have still no available of european version for purchase..........B2-2 form.......
B0074QGGK6|3.0|I got a kick out of this, in spite of its light weight. Mostly I like how it supposes ALL artists steal. And of course they do. The marvellously casual cartoon drawings make it approachable, so I say, Thumbs Up to Austin Kleon. Now go take a nap.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like run games and despicable me 1 and 2 then you will love this game it is one of the funniest games I have ever played and its free
B004ADH1RI|5.0|One of the greatest movies from the 80's. I would recommend this movie to anyone young or old. This is an absolute must see movie to have in your collection.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep was at the same time like, and nothing like The Shining. The one thing Stephen King can do better than any other, is to create worlds through shared imagination. Many overlap as part of a greater, vast landscape - and the territory of The Shining was fertile enough ground to allow Doctor Sleep to flourish.<br /><br />It seems a very natural extension of the story and characters. It was an effortless and captivating story. As always, easy to lose oneself in a good tale. Enjoy.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My 4 year old loves it and has a difficult time passing levels but its good because it keeps him entertained..the characters are also cute looking
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I chose the rating of 5 stars because both of the people I bought The Vampire Diaries first season as a pay it forward gift for two young ladies who just love the show and were thrlled with the DVD.  They both said they really loved it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its addictive. . And when it comes to difficult levels I really suck at it but I don't like giving up.  It was about time it was on Amazon! I kept looking for it since forever!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game and I like to play it with my kiddos who like to see things blow up.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|The Huntsman--Thor is well acted, I didn't realize what  a good actor Chis is. Charlize is good and the camera likes Kristen a lot in this film. Kristen is much prettier than in the Twilight Saga films, but still lacks a little until she gets to the range of Charlize.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|doesnt' really give you any help at all and I felt it really lacks in showing you the levels I deleted this after I got it It was just taking up space,
B000683VI4|5.0|To tell you the truth I haven't played this in my DVD player as it still shows on TV often. When the time comes for me to have to use the DVD I hope it works well in my player.
B00940XIGU|5.0|love the sound quality! It is perfect. and the songs just make you feel good!!!<br />the added songs we're just enough to make it worth buying again.
1451695195|5.0|This book was written with skill, making even the medical details of bacterial meningitis clear to the layman. It is another example of an experience chronicled by Moody in 1976. Gallup polls say that 5-8 million Americans have had a NDE (near death experience). Almost everyone knows someone who has lived to tell about it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|All star cast and similar to other 'staples' in our film repertoire, this also was a must.  We can quote line after line now!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Even though I am stuck on a level this game is a lot of fun. Keeps you alert because you have to be ready for what's around the next bend. Can spend way too long playing this game but it is worth it :-)
1577314808|5.0|I was given to me during a particularly low period in my life. I can say that it changed my life and helped me change the lives of my close ones. It is not a miracle but offers tools to get you going on the path to bliss.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B0063FGFK0|5.0|Not only this is a really good heist/action movie but this collector's edition is everything you need if you are into collecting.<br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO GET!
B008P8B5QM|5.0|Very pleased , these are the most comfortable crocs I've ever owned...and I've owned plenty! Love Them! I highly recommend them!
0449816257|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  From start to finish, it was always a good read.  I am glad that there was three books to this series so I didn't have to come to the end so quickly.  Was able to not only capture my attention but left me wanting just one more!
014241493X|5.0|This is like, the best book ever. I recommend it to every teen out there. John Green is amazing, and I love him.
0547258305|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  From start to finish, it was always a good read.  I am glad that there was three books to this series so I didn't have to come to the end so quickly.  Was able to not only capture my attention but left me wanting just one more!
B008EL25LE|4.0|The chain match 3 is decidedly my least favorite type. But that's personal. This is an excellent game in all aspects - gameplay, graphics, story, plus a diversion in finding details in a scene. There are three modes of play - adventure mode, timed challenge mode and medal challenge mode.<br /><br />One thing puzzles me in the medal challenge mode. After clearing all the background tiles, a medal drops into the game and the tiles below it have to be cleared so it can drop out at the bottom. When the medal has a red line through it, the level will not count as having been completed. So the level may have to be replayed again and again until I get a medal without a red line. That makes this part of the game both frustrating and boring. Unless pure luck determines which medal appears, there should be some kind of instruction on how to meet the challenge. I have not been able to find any kind of explanation.
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|I do enjoy this album.. it's not my favorite CD, but it's definitely worth the purchase. I love that it's different from previous albums but it is still true to the style of the band
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great drama, almost as good as law and order. Love all the actors... We need more episodes in the seasons.... Thumbs up!!!
B00DSAX3X0|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and it was well worth the purchase and then some.. I can't stop listening to it!
B007THA4FI|1.0|This was a very confusing book with too many characters and too much going on. I do not recommend it at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game!! Want more levels. Fun for me and my kids! Ready to have more levels of fun! Fun fun
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The ensemble chemistry is great. They all pretty much fit their roles. The visual effect across the sky was very well done. We always see it in space, never in the sky. Khan was cutthroat in nature, a real villian, and Spock's initial response to violation of the prime<br />directive was right on target. So was McCoy's.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Truly a classic. It seems like regardless of the difference of times, this novel is still as applicable as ever.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I liked the writing style which alternated back and forth between the early 1900's and 2011.  Sad that orphans and foster children still endure some similar emotional and psychological experiences even though our system is much more sophisticated than the era of the &#34;orphan trains&#34; in the early 1900's.  I thought the book was very well written and researched.  I enjoy historical fiction that is able to transport the reader to a time in history and shows the impact on human lives by significant world events .  It was hard to pace myself reading this book....a real page turner!
B00DHHFKE4|4.0|This is a great read but it's clear the show is HEAVILY fictionalised, although many small details in the book are recognisable in some form or other in the series.
B0071T3Q9K|3.0|i liked the songs and the music and the passion Paul sung them with. Its not everyones cup of tea,so to speak but i reccomend giving it a listen ,its something different and was much better than one might think
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  But then I have liked all movies based on Nicholas Sparks books.  Can't wait for more!
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Beginning funny, rest of movie lost my attention.  Maybe they should have stopped after The Hangover part 11.  There were a few highlights, just not many!
074356619X|5.0|I have the CDs in the car and listen to it every day.I also downloaded it onto my phone through Audible.com so I can listen to it anytime, anywhere.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Movie was fine. From the reviews I read by others I was expecting a complete train-wreck. It was not bad, but it did have some semi-ridiculous moments.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been playing for awhile on Facebook, it was ok. But on my Kindle it is Amazing!! Wow!! Highly Recommend to anyone!!
B004G5ZY7E|1.0|Never caught my interest.  Slow paced.  One if the few books I didn't finish.  Only got halfway through it.  I can not understand the hype
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is the most awesome app on earthy. There is one thing it takes forever to load even after it downloads.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Sounds like Roll 'n Rock from the 50, what a great sound!  Saw him live over the summer, he was amazing!
B00915G6R6|5.0|I try to watch the series when it is shown here, but often family matters intervene and it doesn't happen, so I buy the disk and that's good, I get to watch the entire series in sequence and it makes much more sense actually (without the season gaps). I just wish the husband wasn't made to look like such an ass (in everyway), maybe a little younger, warmer and altogether cooler, I really couldn't imagine an intelligent woman staying with him regardless of his being the father of her children and politically successful.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|I enjoyed this video very much. I gave it five stars. The acting is well done. The movie's Director and Producers did their best to add the importance of Roman History. The division of the Roman Empire into two parts, the rise of Christianity, the destruction of the Pagan religions and sad to state, the added destruction of long established Greek Science and Philosophy all through ignorance and superstition. The Christian Leaders destroyed the Library of Alexandria and murdered a Teacher of Science and Astronomy, Hypathia.  There is no doubt that at that period, Christianity was recently an accepted faith and at the same time, Converts were very emotionally involved so the destruction of the past which had fought against the growth of Christianity - even the past which included the great Scholars was to be destroyed as an established pattern of re-affirming the new religion of Christianity. Thank you for your attention.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Love the band, love the musics, love the album...simply one of the bests works of Queens of the Stone Age. And with the participation of Dave Grohl! o//
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've played this addictive game since it first came out. I love it!!!  Now I can enjoy it on a bigger screen thanks to Amazon!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show keeps getting better. Hope it keeps getting better and hope it doesn't slow down any and keep up the great action !
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book took me back to my Irish Catholic heritage.  I enjoyed the dialect and banter of the local people as well as how intimately I got involved with the characters.  It was fiction with a true historical perspective. I thought it was very well written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The app works really good, glad it finally came to the kindle fire HD!! :) very addictive game, can't stop playing it!
B008EL25LE|5.0|I got this game for free from the android market on amazon.  that was very cool.  I have played it for about an hour and it works great on an S4.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I'm a sixth grader I used the calculator an got down with 50 times tables In a half hour it was great
B000I9VOO4|5.0|This is a movie that should be in everyone's library. You can't beat Harper Lee's writing and Horton Foote's adaptation
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is an addictive and fun game and the games connection with facebook makes it even more fun being able to allow you to see the progress and sharing of lives.  Every one shoud try this game even if they don't belong to Facebook ..... Biggregg
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|this game is one of the best. cool idea, story line, and decent controls. made for the kindle fire.sadly, killing Antorians takes like 8 min. to destroy one ship. ONE ship. this makes it a bit boring, but still fun most of the time. 4 and a half stars....
B0066W1AZK|5.0|When I downloaded it I didn't know it was fast.  I would  recommend for for any people who love chess and want it fast.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|If you love putting puzzles together, competing against your friends and getting dozens of puzzles for free, this is the app for you.  It not only gives you a variety of subjects, it also give you the choice of difficulty.  From easy to harder than hard.  Depending on my mood,  I can pick an easy one to give me a chance to think.  Really, how hard is it to concentrate on something important when doing something you love to do.  Meditation time folks.
B0095J0AL6|1.0|It wasn't the yearbook edition, and on the cd it said only available at target. The cd I expected was the yearbook edition.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Even at the original price, this is a great deal. These games are excellent for their story. The two metal gear games are great too. If you haven't played any of these games, then you are missing out on a fantastic series and I would recommend this to you. Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and am glad its a free app. for my Kindle Fire HD.  Now I can play on the go as well as on my pc.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Let's start by the nice deal. You get the three games on the cover and three indie games, which is neat. The indie games take a little while to figure out, but are enjoyable. The three main games, Flow, Flower, and Journey, are superb. They are short and very sweet. These are games for anyone that wants something different from action/adventure and shooter games. Get them if you can.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I really enjoyed Tipping Point and Outliers, so much so that I pick up a copy of anything Gladwell does.  This hasn't worked out so well the last couple of times.  Blink was all right, What the Dog Saw, not so much. This latest effort is my least favorite of the bunch. There are a number of reasons for this.<br />- The topic just isn't as interesting.<br />- The arguments presented are not as compelling.<br />- The stories just aren't told that well.<br /><br />Frankly it just wasn't that much fun to read and I don't think it will stick in my head the way his earlier work did.
0316017930|5.0|Shockingly success may be less random than it seems.  Being born right may have more to do with your future success than hard work and grit.  Still, there is something to be said for being ready and able to meet opportunity, but it seems that opportunity may be best taken advantage of by the right people who are the right age at the right place at the right time.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I bought this because of one song and found myself enjoying the others just as much.  McCartney seems to be churning out a lot of music of later, none are unwelcome'd.  My friends and others were overwhelmed with his performance at Bonaroo  this year, this seems to be norm according to reviews of other appearances around the country.  Sing on Paul,life is fleeting.
0316010669|4.0|Always inciteful there is still no quick fix for expertise.  Just that once you have earned it you can evaluate in the blink of an eye.  Also, that the non expert is more likely to judge well in short exposure with limited information rather than with longer exposure and additional information.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Love it, love it, love it! The arrangement of songs is perfectly matched, each song flowing into another. I loved the whole saga but I think the music made it even better - such great, talented, and some unknown, musicians!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|This game is horrible. Big waste of money. Doesn't even let you play the game! I suggest you people should NOT get it. For those who want to get the game then don't
0385350864|5.0|I was very apprehensive about reading this.  I loved the first books and adored Mark Darcy but this book was actually very moving and poignant.  I am in the same generation as Bridget and \\"was\\" Bridget in her 30's.  I'm not sure why people are so shocked that she would be still obsessed with her weight.  I am, most women who have weight issues always are in some form or other.  And when someone is under pressure you do fall back into bad habits (drinking, smoking etc).  Bridget has matured, she's a loving mom but she's still a woman and I don't think its far fetched for a woman to still want a relationship. Why does one assume that she'll suddenly be a great cook or a person who is more organized.  If anything the fact that she's lost her anchor of Mark Darcy would make you fall back into previous habits.  The aspects of a future of loneliness is everyone's fear and I think Helen Fielding really highlights that well. And its a hopeful book.  I did enjoy it despite all the negativity surrounding it.  Give it a chance
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Delicious reading. Can't wait to start book number two. Well written, good reading. Keeps you intrigued and wanting more and more
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Great ending to a great set of movies!<br /><br />Having the bulk of the cast in this one along with some new players was awesome.
0446693804|3.0|What is with people and their love story obsession? I mean, I like a good love story on occasion, but when a book is drowning in the love between two characters, each page just becomes an overload of sappiness. A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks is basically your typical love story, the relationship between character's Jamie and Landon is completely unrealistic, and while the idea of their relationship is to prove that miracles can happen and there is a place in the world for each and every one of us, the notion that these characters could fall in love within a few months is not likely.<br /><br />This novel is portrayed as a flashback that Landon takes when he walks down the familiar streets of his hometown 40 years after the relationship between himself and Jamie took place. The story occurs in Beaufort, North Carolina in the year 1958 where Landon lives a typical life as a 17 year old boy, his life is suddenly turned around when he attends a school dance with his last pick; the preacher's daughter, Jamie. Landon has no interest in Jamie at the time, but when Jamie asks him to be in the school play with her, Landon feels impelled to help. Landon falls deeply in love with Jamie when she appears on stage the night of the play dressed as an angel, and from that moment, their relationship flourishes throughout the story.<br /><br />The beginning of this book is slow, and drags on and on, you are never really sure when the novel will get interesting, and truthfully... It really doesn't! All of the emotional moments of this book come in the very last chapters, and are lacking so much detail, that it's hard to even feel the emotions that are trying to be portrayed. While reading the last pages I found myself feeling that Nicholas Sparks was in a rush to get this book finished and didn't even take the time to write them well.<br /><br />The storyline of this novel is very sweet, however, as I said earlier, it does not seem likely. Landon and Jamie fall in love within afew months, even after Landon had hated Jamie for the many years they had known each other, what are the chances of that? I do have to say though, after I finished this book, I did find myself smiling on the inside... Just a little...<br /><br />A Walk to Remember is a love story... That's all I can say to describe it. It's not great, it's not bad, it's just a slow, sappy, over dramatic love story, yet it has the ability to fill your heart with joy.
B00BMR5HOO|3.0|this weather app is really helpful when you need to know how cold it is going to get. this is a great app.
B00A2H9X6I|5.0|this movie truly sticks to the \\"reimagining\\" types of movies as the producers said, it is a reimagining. it contains better acting with awesome chloe grace moretz and award-winning actress julianne moore, comes the best \\"reimagining\\" you will probably see in my opinion, with more better effects, and more blood than ever!!!
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Dope. Cant stop listening to it and im an old fart. 26. Talented 16 year old for sure...... Wish it came out in the spring. great summer album.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Good, basic calculator for the Kindle. Easy to use when I need a quick calculator. It has all of the basic functions that a calculator should.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is the best game in the universe!!!!!! Good for kids and adults.......very addicting.........this is a very amazing game............I hope you and your kids have fun.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's an absolute must read! The author did a wonderful job building up each character's story into this magnificent puzzle.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was one of those books that was so good all I wanted to do was read. No TV watching, no internet surfing, just read. Usually I have trouble with books that are about time travel but not this one.  I think having lived during that time period 1958 to 1964 made it a lot more interesting to me.  It took me back to my youth and so many things I had forgotten. When it ended I was sad, because I wanted more of it, although it had a wonderful ending.  So good it took me a while to get started on anything else.  Anyone who is old enough to remember, remembers exactly where they were and what they were doing when they got the news that Kennedy had been shot. I highly recommend this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|lots of never ending fun. I'm not that good so I can spend weeks getting past some levels and get others quickly.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I have to admit it was probably one of the best books I have ever read and I'm definitely reading the second one
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I have a Droid Razr M and the software will NOT work on my phone.  I have installed it twice and all it does is sit there &#34;synchronizing contacts&#34;.  Will NOT get past that point.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Was what I was looking for. Works great. Cleared space simply and easily. Seemed to make difference in the performance of my mobile device.
B00EDPFJA4|1.0|Song titles never came up on my display for this cd and I dont know why since all other cds do. I was not happy with my purchase.
B00CO9DY76|4.0|This is a good belt clip for my keys. It seems well made and more sturdy than some of the other &#34;not for climbing&#34; carabineers on Amazon, and it has a little utility as well. I would have liked it to have possibly a prybar or pokey tool.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn and this book. She has a way of showing the ugly and beautiful at the same time, without being judgmental. Libby is a great character and the story keeps you guessing until the very end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would always see my friends showing the progress on Facebook and I would be annoyed. Now I know why! Great fun easy game!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, addictive, time consuming, silly, free, frustrating, colorful, repetitive, and that's about all there is to it in a nutshell.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Well worth the wait!  Fantastic book by Stephen King.  I love all of his books and this latest was no exception.  Awesome reading.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. My only complaint is that the paintbrush and hammer are too close together. I hit the wrong one on accident a few times; that could be solved by me slowing down a bit so I won't deduct any stars for it.  Otherwise I have nothing bad to say about the game.
B00FFL8ZMY|3.0|It has a few good songs. The other ones were pretty good for the most part. If I could do it again I would probably just buy the ones I liked like Fortress song.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's fun enough. I don't like the way it sets you up on each level and I haven't figured out how to move between levels but overall well worth my time.
B008OHV5HS|4.0|Like your rock with Valkyrean melodies, themes, and sonics?  Miss soaring full-voiced vocals like Journey’s Steve Perry or Kansas’ Kerry Livgren?  Want your daily dose of doomsayer dismissals?  Then stand up, Beano.  Threshold hails the warriors’ dogma that your karma is your own to make.  And they do it with a relentlessly musical crunch that crackles with intensity.  Singer Damian Wilson leads bass, drums, keys, fueled harmonies and dueling guitars through a maelstrom of multi-laminate metal, firing off lyrics laced with lamentations and perseverance.  “Ashes” defines the march of progress.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|luv the fact that u can have separate note books it's awesome !!!!!(: it's cool that u can put pics in it
B004S9OYBA|4.0|Among the Corrs sibs' recordings, the solos consistently divorce themselves from the family band's past collective genius.  Andrea Corr's latest is a collection of covers of a wide range of songwriters including Roy Orbison (\\"Blue Bayou\\"), Nick Drake (\\"From the Morning\\"), Jon Anderson (\\"State of Independence\\"), and Paul Buchanan of The Blue Nile (\\"Tinseltown in the Rain\\").  While Corr's interpretations are rewarding in their own right, they veer into life's dappled shadows more than The Corrs ever did as a band; The Corrs' sunny optimism and layered harmonies are replaced with wistful melancholy and Andrea's darker alto exploring life's lines, all worth revisiting.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This Book Is A Fantastic Paranormal Love Story.One Of The Best Book Series I've Ever Read.Better Than Twiligt.Okay,almost.A Beautiful Idea.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I bought this as a present for my brother. I had read it previously. I read it on the bus and I laughed out loud several times. Now the people on the bus probably think I'm insane, but I think that David Sedaris would approve. My brother also loved it.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|It might be a little more expensive than other kits in the market, it is definitely worth it.  It includes instructions for patterns and the rubber bands are of good quality.  My daughter loves it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My Dad has this game on his iphone and now i get to enjiy it on my Kindle :) Thanx Amazon!
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I love the series and can't wait to read the last two books.  This is my least favorite book in the series. This definitely could have been combined with crows. It is full of so much nothing and uninteresting conversation. The Danaerys character seems to be focus of this book and she is boring as ever. I really hope GRRM keeps her in  east with her dragons or kill her off. The Westeros story line and the north need to be focused on and complete.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This show is off to a great start. We are trying to be good and watch 1 episode per week. No marathons so far. Storyline is fantastic. It is riveting.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Outside the language...Mud was a fantastic coming of age movie. My opinion...Mud had more growing up to do instead of the two young boys. All in all the movie was awesome!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR EVA! *ahem* Sorry this is the real deal folks. GET YOUR CANDY ON WOOOOOO
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was totally immersed in the story.  I love the plots and the twists and turns that go on.  I love watching it as a marathon.<br />Anxious for Season 4!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A brilliant follow through of a story and character that have become legendary. A great read that never sells out it's classic King style. I couldn't put it down and I didn't want it to end.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Sanderson outdoes himself again in terms of the setting. The world with Epics is an entirely different place than we know it now. The worldbuilding, which is what we all read Sanderson for, is fantastic. Unfortunately, I feel like this book has the same plot as the first Mistborn novel, with a few tweaks here and there. We have a tough, young, orphaned protagonist who finds their place among a band of rebels, led by an older man with a dark past, trying to overthrow a seemingly omnipotent emperor in a world that is entirely broken.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Steelheart and any sequels Sanderson writes, I will read, but it's the same book as Mistborn, which is a little disappointing.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Brilliant, well worth the installation. I've tried others but not with the ease and success that this little freebie has given. As an author I carry my Kindle fire with me to jot down ideas and paragraphs. So easy to then bring up my home desktop and insert directly into the book without the need for wires etc.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, took me a little bit to figure it out. It was free so that makes it that much better!
B004Z4LZ7E|2.0|I saw this book at a children's Museum and the price was around $40. Amazon had a much better price so I purchased it through Amazon.<br />The first book I received it did not have a plastic wrap on it the pages were not cut right pages were falling out and the cover was scratched it looked like someone had thrown this book out and sold it at a garage sale.<br />The second book was much better but again no plastic wrap these books were like they are used and sold on Amazon.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is by far the best I have used with my Fire.  I have had one in black for some time. more than a year and I would say it has gotten heavy daily use. I have my Fire with me almost constantly.  My previuos one has gotten the corners rubbed off and the fold seem is getting weak,not torm or broken  just not as stiff as when new. I would deffinately recomend this product to anyone looking for a well made case.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Thanks, Amazon Instant Videos, for including the 2nd season on your streaming videos!  Highly  recommended!  Great drama!  Be sure to also join Amazon Prime, if you haven't already, to watch this and many other shows and movies for free, as well as get free 2 day shipping on most Amazon purchases and other benefits for one price.
0399534601|5.0|This was my fifth purchase of Keri Smith books! I absolutely adore every single one and I will continue to buy them from her! Great for someone who loves crafts.
1582701709|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read young or old. It really could change your life. I can probably count on one hand how many books I've read from start to finish but its hard to put this one down.
B000QJLQY4|5.0|100% great business advice,<br />Invaluable for any type of business you want to start. I have read a lot of business books, and this one is packed full of myth-shattering and a lot of great advice for starting the successful way, from a VC founder who knows what he is talking about.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great season.  I enjoyed watching it--took me two days but I couldn't stop!  Watch it-you'll be happy you did!<br />Zina
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Yet another brilliant season of a brilliant show! Love how the characters intertwine and their exploits. Who wouldn't want to be Alexis Castle??
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Use it to put my son to sleep at night. There are several combinations to choose from and the options menu is well setup.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Another awesome season of one of the greatest shows ever! Love all the characters more than ever and can't wait for season 9!!
B00F5F0208|5.0|Nothing to talk about here.. plain as day.. its a classic album and you know what? i tried to hate it..lol... Beat me into submission. Handsssss down a classic album.. front to back... #Salute Drake.. keep doing you brother...
B000JPRPAO|3.0|Fun to watch as good crooks chase bad crooks and win, then everybody except the bad crooks live happily ever after.  Recommend for a fun evening when you want to pay attention to your lover while watching a movie.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Thank you for this! I'm loving the 5.1 surround... mmm.<br /><br />Amazing album and beautiful sound, and the regular copy for my car!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very good ending and good closer to my questions about what happened afterwards to Danny and his mom a good read especially if you liked the Shining.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This movie was great! The characters & story line were great. We watched it again the next day. The whole time we kept watching the movie we kept saying how Eep's character was what we expected the character in Brave to be like and was very disappointed it was not. Dreamwork's does it again. I wish we had just bought it rather than rent it. I will be adding this to the buy list.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Walking me through a process step by step. It made it possible to fulfill my dream of writing my book and getting it published
B00ESNE696|5.0|Am now addicted to watching it every Sunday night on  CBS  I really do not understand where they got that title from, but the series is what I like. Good story line.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|If Hosseini wasn't an author he might as well have been a poet. Words, sentences and stories which touch a chord at the emotional as well as spiritual level. Seemingly simple events,occurrences or moments lost in time, all leave their mark on this vivid canvas of life.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I have been watching Castle from day one.  It is such a pleasure to see a cute teenager without all the present day tattoos or piercings .  The whole show is a pleasure to see.  Love the mother .
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is awesome. PvP is the bomb. If you enjoy PvP, try Gameloft gamed. I couldn't stop playing for about two months. If you like this, try Blitz Brigade. Gameloft is the best.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would like the game to be updated so that all of your horses can roam the paddock at the same time. It would look cool. It would be easy to select your horse because all you would have to do is tap a horse to change to it. An Icon in the corner could display which horse is selected at that time.
0446310786|5.0|I totally recommend this seller. Easy Breezy buying and you can't beat the price. The holidays are approaching,don't forget to check them out today!
B007SVPZMW|5.0|I've played this for a few days now on my Kindle Fire, and if you enjoy tic tac toe I recommend this app.  You can play as 1 player vs the computer or 2 player.  I've only tried 1 player vs the computer but it's fun and you win some you lose some so it feels pretty fair and not like it's rigged.  I've had no install or operational issues so far.  It's just a very simple and straightforward app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The series is so wonderful, that it's difficult for me to wait for the next season to begin.  Like all good things, it will eventually will come to end.  Hopefully, PBS will contiue to have high quality series like this one
B0047SKR54|4.0|This version is okay but the director's cut is better in theme. While Dolby digital audio is good I believe DTS audio is clearly superior.
B008ROG6E0|4.0|With the advent of Obamacare could this be far behind?  It isn't really all that impossible.<br />Soylent Green is another.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Have had this app for a long time and it makes typing easy. I like the arrows at the  bottom
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was on the fence about this show.  After the third episode i stopped watching. A friend said give it time., wait till the end of season 1 and you will see, it will all make sense and kick in.  After the seventh episode again i was skeptical. Then, once the last few episodes of the season one finished i now cannot wait to see the other seasons!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is another hack and slash style. Graphics are really nice for a pocket device game. I like the fact that you can control the direction of your arrows. Other games I've played that are similar did not have that option. Overall a really good game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read. Very exciting and keeps you on your toes!! Highly recommend this book. Getting ready to order the next book!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The character development is fantastic and I am always left wondering who will &#34;go&#34; next.  Continuously left on the edge of your seat!
140006922X|4.0|The author takes you through his personal religious journey and what became his quest for the true Jesus. He develops the character of Jesus by what we can reasonably accept as possible truths and rejects opinions that contradict our best knowledge of the history of the time Jesus lived. The book will challenge what you think you know about Jesus and what is generally accepted in mainstream Christianity. I found the book to be a refreshing take on Jesus, with no effort to discredit his name, just a fair analysis of his life without the mass of myth that has been created around him.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved the original The Shining and King has improved over the years.  I didn't think that was possible!  His story line and characterizations are delicious.  Danny Torrence has grown a lot since his days of writing &#34;Redrum&#34; on the mirror.  I read Black House, the sequel to The Talisman, but this was better. I am a Constant Reader.
1932100660|5.0|This is a well presented analysis of the effects of nutrition on the health of the individual. The author explores the incidences of certain diseases based on a study that examined the regionally diverse diets of a genetically like population. He expands on the results of this &#34;China Study&#34; relating his experiences as a researcher throughout his career. Interesting and entertaining for those who have a desire to improve their health and learn about the relationship between diet and the diseases so prevalent in modern societies. Complete and comprehensive, this book just might change your life!
1579655327|5.0|First of all, this is not a cookbook full of complicated and mouth gaping recipes for veteran cooks. This is for people like us, who are too lazy to experiment with fussy recipes after working 10-14 hours a day. Its perfect for those who want to serve something nice, healthy, fresh, good to look at, yet real easy to whip up, to a couple of friends chilling on a weekend afternoon, instead of ordering boring pizza from domino's. If that's the kind of cookbook you are looking for then this book will be just right for you. The portraits just make the cookbook that much more interesting and different from your traditional cookbooks, making it a perfect piece not only for your kitchen counter, but for your coffee table as well!
159463176X|5.0|The books all adds up to a cohesive whole in the end, although initially it's somewhat confusing as we are introduced to a plethora of characters and a time line that starts, stops, skips and goes backwards.  But as the story lines converge we could see counterpointing themes of family love and abandonment, poverty and entrapment, an choices with no clear answer, It's a fine work of literature.
B00ANMAH30|5.0|This whole album from start to finish is a pure prog-rock goody, the lyrics are very interesting since they each narrate a very vivid stories, such as \\"watcher of the skies\\" or \\"get 'em out by friday\\". The fun in the whole album is to understand the storyline, not only that but if you pay close atention the album art may obtain relevance as you progress through the album. Musically they are in their best period in my own sincere opinion, from the first notes played on watcher of the skies to the ultimate climax of apocalypse in 9/8.<br />Now getting into the vinyl itself, the sound is crisp and clear, very well remastered, in my opinion it is much better than \\"The lamb lies down on broadway\\"'s remaster, (i am not saying the other one is bad though...) It is pretty much a silky quiet pressing, defintely worth the money if you are a genesis or a prog-rock fan!
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have a better understanding of why Apple is so successful in the market place.
B00A2H9WW8|1.0|I vehemently hate remakes of great movie classics.<br />The exceptions have been John Carpenter's approach to THE THING, another was INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and two others: THE RING and THE BLOB.<br />The original 1976 CARRIE became a landmark in movie making. We had phenomenal performers--Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie (both nominated for Academy Awards), a knockout supporting cast, fantastic direction from Brian DePalma, a powerful music score,screenplay, editing, etc.<br />In this version I saw this afternoon, the whole movie looks like it was filmed through an unwashed window. The colors were flat, almost pastel. Chole Grace Moretz portrayed the misfit Carrie White as a beautiful young girl who wears her hair matted over her left eye. In no way, does she look like a pitiful, abused girl, only one who just needs to brush her hair and raise her face.<br />Julianne Moore as Margaret White, the mother, is ugly, skeletal, who mumbles so low it was impossible to understand her most of the time. Piper Laurie portrayed her as a voluptuous woman with a magnificent mane of red hair that resembled a halo.<br />We never see much of Carrie's newly discovered powers. She makes things rise up and down, doors slam, and at the end, she does suddenly unleash her fury. But she has no interesting enemies to payback for their bullying.<br />I missed the powerful music score of the original, and looked for something different.<br />This rendering was so bloodless and anemic, it could play on the Disney Channel with little editing.<br />And yes, this version copies the original scenes down to that final ending where &#34;Sue&#34; dreams of taking flowers to Carrie's grave.<br />This grade-Z remake reminds me again of the total drought of fresh ideas in Hollywood.<br />For the $30 million it took to make this bomb, the money could have been invested in a brand new horror classic--the kind we saw when brilliant minds gave us such classics as PSYCHO, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, ALIEN, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD, HALLOWEEN and of course CARRIE.<br />Surely, these filmmakers are out there, dying for a chance to give movie-goers something fresh, new, original. Yet, I hear we may be getting yet ANOTHER remake of a classic: CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. And the filmmaker: none other than junk meister, Rob Zombie who gave us those ghastly junk remakes of HALLOWEEN., CARNIVAL OF SOULS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD, HALLOWEEN and of course CARRIE.<br />Surely, these filmmakers are out there, dying for a chance to give movie-goers something fresh, new, original. Yet, I hear we may be getting yet ANOTHER remake of a classic: CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. And the filmmaker: none other than junk meister, Rob Zombie who gave us those ghastly junk remakes of HALLOWEEN.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Don't play if you're tired. It's very thought provoking. It took my husband and myself to get through several levels and then dreamed that night that we couldn't escape from a house!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I have been playing it on my PC and smartphone and now it is finally available on my Kindle Fire. Now I can sit in my easy chair and play and the screen is larger than my smartphone. Thank you Amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game<br />Gave it three stars because you have to purchase lives or other boosters to beat most of the higher levels. And there seems to be no way to earn extra boosters
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Beautiful scenery and great acting.  the story is wonderful - - far better than anything you can watch on television.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|this breaks down the things that we should all know into basic ideas.  I learned a lot from this book and certainly would recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Totally addicting game. So glad it finally made it Kindle. Can't put it down. Ready for all King games on Kindle.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This season was quite entertaining- a little bit busy with all the side stories going on but it kept it interesting.<br />As for the transaction, everything was as smooth as could be. The product had a very good price and was delivered quickly.  I would gladly buy from this vendor again.
B006QPX6IG|5.0|Very good historical movie, many scenes are forced but to set the stage and background for the Battle of Gettysburg. Well done, to the re-enactors.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Our book club just read this book and it prompted much discussion.  All agreed it was an excellent read.  I highly recommend this book  - is well written  and the plot keeps the reader in suspense till the very end.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|No question, I am hooked on this show, and I'm truly disappointed that to catch it now, I'll have to watch regular television.  I may just wait till Amazon has it again.  I much prefer having no commericals to wade through, and I don't own a DVR.  Anyway, the plots are engaging and the characters more so.  Great fun!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|cd is great; i love it.  however, i ordered three cd's, they put all of them in the same envelope and when they arrived the case for this one was cracked badly enough that after removing the plastic the corner fell off.  since i save my cases i wasn't terribly pleased but didn't want to mess with trying to return the item either
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|With an economy of words, Graeme Simsion creates unforgettable characters a fun adventure full of warmth, charm and sophistication.  The most fun read in a long time!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This film reminds me of the block busters of old.  Great fun for a summer movie.  Might become a cult classic
B004SIAGC2|5.0|This book is a series of interviews with 18 of the top stock, option and commodity traders of the day when it was written in 1990. Most were unknown to the public, and even to most professional investors, until Jack Schwager ferreted them out and amazingly convinced these \\"traders who neither need nor seek publicity\\" to allow him to interview them and publish their stories. Now, 23 years later, Schwager's \\"Wizards\\" are the stuff of legend among speculators both professional and amateur.<br /><br />The interviews are divided into five groups: futures traders, stock traders, outliers (hard to classify), floor traders and a trader psychologist. There are two postscript sections, one describes a personal experience of Schwager's as a trader, and the other an interesting story told by an anonymous top trader about dreams and trading.<br /><br />Schwager's interview style is what one might call \\"organized improvisational.\\" He is a master of getting people to reveal the highlights of their careers and learning processes. At the end of each interview he summarizes what he learned into a few concise paragraphs. This alone makes this book worth reading for anyone interested in trading, speculating or investing.<br /><br />I see that Jack Schwager released an updated version of this book in 2012 and I eagerly look forward to reading that soon. This book deserves five stars. It is an investment classic.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I am a fan of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series of books.  With Angels Flight, I think he has topped everything I have read.  Intriguing story with more turns and twists than you can imagine.  Couldn't put it down.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Read the book! It really is an intelligent, insightfully written story that puts us in the front row, and what we see is not pretty. Bravo Piper!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy to finally play candy crush on my Android tablet. Now just waiting for ds  and dw to download
0062014536|4.0|Told in alternating chapters between Lena and Hana, we watch as the forces that are both for and against the government reach critical mass back in Lena's hometown of Portland. Lena's group is heading that way via Connecticut, while we see bits and pieces of Portland's present through Hana's eyes. I thought that Hana's section were especially intriguing, as she was paired with a minor politician after completing her procedure. Of course, things change, but Hana's recollection of her role in Lena and Alex's escape seems to drive her present feelings. The final book in this series was very strong, but ended just a tad abruptly for me.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. Yes you have to break out the credit card but I don't mind spending a little to play such an enjoying game. I spend hours playing this. The multiplayer option is nice to have.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Steven King! very well written , suspenseful  with surprises all the way to the very end. I had trouble putting this down at night
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Grate story and first rate special effects. If you want to get your lady warmed up let her watch this flick.
0374533555|5.0|Well written. I am reading it slowly.<br />I am absorbing and processing a lot<br />of thought here by this author.<br />Brilliant.
B00AEFXZNU|5.0|I really loved this movie. It is a great story anyways but it had some differences from the original that made it a lot better. I loved that they gave Ren more depth with his character and made him a lot more likeable. He helped pull Ariel away from her downward spiral instead of just going along with it. I thought the music was great and the dancing was fun. It was well put together and acted well. I wasn't sure about Juliann Hough but she did a good job.
0399226907|5.0|One year old nephew loves this book!  Goes to bed every night clutching it begging mom n dad to read it to him!
B00F880BWG|5.0|I am a fan of the series.  The writers and actors have not gotten bored with their craft.  It was exciting and everything I hoped for entertainment.  Thank you for creating such entertaining episodes and story line so well put together and acted out.  I am enthralled.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|all time classic,  watch it several times during the year, far better in HD in quality and sound.  Purchase this classic through amazon.com, price is great, delivery time from store to home is awesome. no need to leave the home.  hard to find in retail stores. a quick search through amazon.com and BAM! is there for you to take home.<br /><br />love this movie,  ALL Time Favorite.  Thank you
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|When I began reading the Husband's Secret, I wasn't sure. All three story lines had easy, predictable paths that they might have followed. They didn't! There are twists and turns where you least expect them.<br />The ending is amazing. As a lover of character driven fiction, that ending was perfect for me. Without needing a spoiler alert, I can say I loved the clever way that any remaining questions a reader might have were answered.<br />It's a read and read again book.
B0001I561E|1.0|I loved this movie as a child and was so excited to get this for my little girl. Upon receiving this movie I found that it wouldn't work in our player. Called Disney only to find out that the one I bought off of Amazon was pirated.
B003F48E4W|4.0|I enjoyed most of it.  I just gotta say, the last line of the movie was awesome!  I also liked the 80's soundtrack.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Its was nice to use Amazon Prime to watch whatever I wanted on demand! Better selection than Netflix. Seems a good deal.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Brilliant new album with the great sounds and lyrics Dream Theater does so well. The rt work of the info book was stuning just like their music. Sure to be a classic.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|We enjoyed this movie which had a very fast pace. The characters were excellently portrayed. The villain was portrayed very well through the entire movie.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I enjoyed this book and thought it was well written.  Not sure I would recommend to others.  It seems like I've been reading lots of books lately with the main character battling with mental illness.  While it's enlightening to get  inside their heads and understand their mental disabilities, I find it depressing.  Time to move onto books with happier characters, I guess.
1439153663|1.0|Sent away for this book to replace one that I had damaged from a high school library.  Placed an order for seven other books at the same time on the same order.  Received all books except this one.  This was the only one not for me personally.  Never received it.  Now happy at all!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book and I still think about it long after I've read it.  This is about a time in US history that I knew very little about, the orphan trains.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This account of Jesus as a man, albeit a a sinless and perfect man, appears to be a forthright explanation of Jesus as written in the Qur'an.  It appears to be very well researched and quite believable. But its real value is in showing how Islam and Christianity can both be Abrahamic faiths with a lot in common and quite capable of coexistence.
1609611543|5.0|We are eating wheat free, losing weight and have so much more energy. Def worth the read and the purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've got nothing bad to say! You can play for 5 minutes or an hour, you won't be disappointed! Seriously!!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Very easy to read with great exercisce to test the material given. The humou is nice to have too. Great journey.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Jon Rhys Meyers does not look close to Henry VIII as an older King but he rocked this portrayal with his shear force and fierceness and regal confidence.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I played it for awhile and it was fun but no challenge for me try it and you may like it
156898443X|5.0|This is a great gift for people who draw in sketchbooks to see the work of others. And this is an interesting tale of a man who stuck by his wife after run over by a train. The paragraphs including his son's feelings or actions are especially touching.
0800141660|4.0|Emma Thompson did a great job on the script and I thought it was a sweet movie.  A movie you can watch with the whole family
B000I9U8VO|4.0|Excellent X-Men movie. Full of action and intriguing storyline. You can really appreciate the two perspectives and the fine line between the \\"Good\\" X-Men like professor Charles Xavier and the \\"Evil\\" X-Men like Magneto and how easy it is to cross that line like Pyro did. Rebecca Romaine is amazing in her role as Mystique in this film.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Great movie, one which you will watch over and over  staring Gwyneth Paltrow who is just right for this part.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This is the BEST GAME EVER since I got it. My son loves sonic the hedgehog and sometimes let me play on it
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|I LIKED THE 4 CASSETTE BETTER. IT LET YOUR IMAGINATION CREATE AND PICTURE IT IN YOUR MIND. IT'S HELPED ME.
B00A2H9WW8|5.0|This movie was well done.  Julianne Moore did a very good job portraying the mother, and Chloe Grace Moretz is a good actress.  I was pleased with this.  Chloe Moretz did excellent playing Carrie White, and her feelings toward her classmates was brought up well in the film, too.  The beginning was different in comparison to the original Carrie, and the ending was good.  Overall, I'd recommend this.  I'd see it again.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Better than I expected.<br /><br />It was a pretty good book. Another great accomplishment by Jeff Kinney if I do say so myself. I actually did a book report on this book. Pretty easy. So overall I would recommend everyone who reads this review to purchase this book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|As simple as this game is its really quite fun. Even the upgrades are simple to understand and yet still quite effective in the way they operate.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Clear and exact words, no enigmatics trues or revelations, just a call for use your imagination. Tesla life learn you about don't give up and play for the adventure, I love this book!
1476727651|5.0|I would recommend this to any fan of Stephen King's work, any horror fan, and especially anyone who enjoyed &#34;The Shining&#34;. It is a worthy follow-up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really funny game. So can have few minutes only to spend with these small figures. Lets play it together. What do you think?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone told me this game is fun and they are right. They  however forgot to tell me how addictive it is!! I spend a lot of time through out the day playing this game and you Will too. Enjoy!!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Fantastic, brilliant. I have watched it five times already ! I can't wait to get season seven! I love this show!
B00448VST6|5.0|My son loves this movie, it provides the kind of mind bending teenager stuff that teens are attracted to and it is just adult enough for adults to have fun as well. There is nothing like having to prove yourself to a girl, but seven evil x's? Wow how hard can it get! Very funny, romantic, twisted enough to make one think for a second before the roller coaster takes off again.
B002361MLA|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. I appreciated his secular approach to defining enlightenment. If you wish to evolve your thinking on what it means to human, you'll like this study on the subjecy.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This is one of those scary movies that provide the scare factor that lingers on long after the movie is over. Its not a slasher movie where everyone dies by some fruitcake in the woods.  It's a love story of sorrow and pain brought about by an awful decision that must be made right.
B00CDTSQZW|4.0|The opening scene says it all. It's dark, dreary, and death ladened. The hairy, blood-spattered faces are not attractive. The lifestyle and values are not something I can identify with, yet I found myself glued to the tv. I sat watching this series with an appalled, disgusted look on my face most of the time (due to the violence), but I was captivated. The story is so foreign, the landscape so coldly wonderful. And the sea! I have heard about Vikings of course, but seeing it played out was more than my mind could imagine. The culture and history were riveting. It left me wanting more.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I received this item promptly.<br />I love her music and videos.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves the violin!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game but it is very addictive. Very easy to learn but the levels do very difficult. Very glad I bought it. Play it often. Love
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|It's fun to have one mystery continue throughout the entire season, rather than solving an entire episode in one hour. Kind of reminds me of &#34;The Killing.&#34; Characters are multi-dimensional and deep, rather than caricatures. Very exciting.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Scary and disturbing from the first episode to the last. The story line and character development is superb. If you are looking for a movie to watch on Halloween that will make you jump, scream and your skin crawl...skip the movie listing and watch this show instead.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Maybe it's just me but even at sixty I have so enjoyed all the a grey bird games. This one is no exception. The. Set so far love talk g my kindle to Dr. Appointments and playing it. Makes the lo g wait a fun find
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So Happy to have Candy Crush on my Kindle. More variety to play. Download it today. You will love it, too.😃
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Excelent game. My little boy love it and me too. We expend a lot of hours playing it. . .
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is amzing instead of being super easy it is actually quite a challenge and also you get to swing,climb, and sprint all over New York City
B00EIMJVOM|3.0|I LOVE Jessie J and think she has an incredible voice (just check out her live performances on youtube especially the acoustic versions of her songs!) I really wanted to like this album, but I am very disappointed. There are really no stand out songs that catch my attention. I was really hoping for something more and better. She might want to start considering letting others write some songs for her. I bought the Deluxe version for the extra songs because I do like the song Magnetic. Her first album is much better and I do think she now does too much of the vocal acrobats. I will continue to follow her in hopes thar her next album in a few years is better.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Only comment is that I wish they idenitied the actors with their parts<br />at the beginning credits.<br />Love the series...
B00DUE8IXY|4.0|For someone not yet 18, Birdy is a great song writer. Her lyrics are beyond their years. She has a maturity like none other out there right now. No....she doesn't have a BIG voice, but there is something enduring and special about the music she writes. There is something for everyone on this album. Words as Weapons and No Angel are two of my favs on this album. It's soft and not over the top. The mood of this album reminds me of Emeli Sande or Adele. You can relate to many of the lyrics on the album. It's definitely worth a listen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm soooooo glad that I'm able to play Candy Crush on my Kindle now it's been a long time coming.  Cause some you just want to sit in the same chair to stay comfortable!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|First of all the version of Facebook I had installed on my tablet said it was outdated, so I'm trying to download the update and it's not letting me!  Help please!
B009G41CG2|4.0|I am looking for a different game of Mahjong. This is ok, but not enough tiles. . I will keep looking.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|One of the only complaints I have about this game is the amount of lives you can accumulate. Other than that it's a super fun game that everyone in the house enjoys.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I didn't like it, did not find that it helped me at all ...<br />Would not recommend it, would talk about my experience to friends & family and let them decide
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's fun, best HUNTING game out. Great practice playing with my son. Couldn't  be better than it is right now. Definite pick!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Someone else turned me on to this game and I find it an enjoyable pass time...<br />If I could rate it higher I would, love it, love it...<br />I would and have recommended it to my family and friends...<br />I like the different levels...
B007HACDLK|5.0|ITS TOO BAD VINCE IS NO LONGER WITH US.  MITCH RAPP NEEDS TO LIVE ON SO WE CAN AT LEAST PRETEND WE HAVE SOMEONE LOOKING OUT FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE USA.  RIP.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I expected a biography of Tesla. Instead this is a come on for the author's other books and philosophy. The brief story of Tesla which is included didn't begin until over 30% into the short book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG! I have been waiting for it to come out on to Amazon!! I love this app! Great way to pass the time.
B00280LYIC|3.0|Very good book. It was some slight differences from the movie but still a great read! The kids still love this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very realistic and fun to play. to be honest im 20 and i love playing this game. it would be cooler if you could chat with friends while playing but im not complaining, :b my daughter loves this game too anything to do with horses really but this is her favorite game. i guess if i had one bad thing to say it would be it takes forever to level up.. but its worth it  .
B008XG1X18|4.0|There are some things that I can't do on this app and I have to go to my computer but it is not bad for browsing and pinning.
B004UPALT6|3.0|Excellent product. I like.<br />The video is excellent.<br />Good sound quality.<br />I recommend it to all my friends.<br />Thanks amazon for their service.
B002WN35DC|5.0|This is a classic ,I have enjoy many times because  I  always learn  something  each time I read .<br />This book is for every age that the reader will appreciate in different stages of life
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kids and I are having fun with this. Not too complicated, but still involving.  Great find!  Each room has between 3-5 tools to find and use to open the door. Just the right speed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a good game<br />Some blocks are amazing<br />The updates are also amazing<br />Update 0.8.0 will be awesome with POWER RAILS !!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is the perfect alarm clock for my needs.  I've only had it for a short time and already I'm impressed!
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I've been watching The Final Destination series, starting with the very first movie all the way to this fifth one, and I must say that it always kept me on the edge of my seat! I give this movie five stars because it gives you suspense, gore, and a twist at the end that you never saw coming. The beginning starts with high energy and never disappoints all the way through to the end.  I have no complaints. Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves a good unique, chilling, and gory movie. A must see! :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great I have it on  my Tv on my Terrace  and I can watch Net flix on the Tv there all I do is transfer the video from my laptop or my Kindle to the TV and it is great and the price is right. 35.00.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Get this book NOW!!!!!!!! This book is the BOMB PEEPS!!!!!!! If you can ignore a book like this you have AWESOME willpower!!!!!!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read. It's so different and I think everyone can relate to either Hannah or Clay. I am so glad Amazon suggested this book to me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Terrific sequel. We appreciate this prolific author and the talents he bestows. This was truly one of his finest books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a fun game wich includes killings zombies and spiders. also in creative mode you can build traps or pranks or something to try to build in survival
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was laughing through out the book, and it really does make you believe in silver lining.  F.Y.I. there are a lot of difference between the book and the movie.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|i love thi sgame it is awesome o love pancakes i love waffles i love poop i love eating poopcakes i love deerhunter2014 i love my mom i love my dad i love everthing
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is a great way to keep your little cousins quiet,and also a great game for teenagers. The graphics are great the voices are spot on, my only complaint is that there are in app purchases and you can't stop the younger kids from buying stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I looooooooov this game it is totally addictive and fun I love the new orleens one because I love halloween and its pased on haalloween so ya GET THIS APP ITS SO MUCH FUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Great actiion packed movie with a suprise ending. The cast was also great and it kept you on the edge of your seat right up to the end.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I am an avid reader and will read almost anything. However I could not punish myself into finishing this book. The plot was nonexistent, the characters were mundane, and the tempo was stagnant. I literally could not keep my eyes open to finish this book. I'm not sure if I'm missing something but I just don't understand all of the raving reviews.
B00AX6KNOY|5.0|5 stars because I would watch it again. It was great to see actors in earlier roles. They all did a great job.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Entertainment at its best!<br />If you like broadway shows mixed with glamour, imagination, great music to enhance a classic, this is your movie. If you are looking to match the book, the era and calm, this is not for you.<br />This is our top 10 fav movie!
0451418441|4.0|I haven't read the book so I base my comment on the tv mini series. I liked it but the end disappointed me. After all the conflict with his mother over the apparent death of his father the 'late' king by her orders, it made no sense that she was able to convince him to become his father's new executioner after finding out he was alive. I was hoping for his letting him go on living anonymously as no one else knew who he really was and as the actual king, he could have imposed his word over what his mother might have said implying the fact that the supposedly 'late' king was still alive. Still, the story was awesome and I enjoyed most of it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! The only thing I don't like, is knowing that the next book is called losing Hope...now I'm afraid if something bad happening to their wonderful love/relationship or Hope/Sky dying? Ugh!
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|While not a bad movie, and full of special effects and high production values, this reboot feels small and no where near the epic of the 1980's original.
B008MM9630|4.0|I thought that this game was pretty good because..<br />1. It's fun and<br />2. It's still fun.<br />If someone would make more stuff that didn't need gems to purchase them it would be a lot better.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, challenging game, free and very few ads.  After seeing others play it constantly, i understand now how addicting it is.
B004P02OJ6|4.0|We were looking for something to watch and saw very good reviews for this movie and we were not disappointed.  I have no idea why this went immediately to DVD because it had a great cast and was very exciting.  I found it under drama, but I would consider it an action film as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works just as advertised.  Now I can control whatever Netflix or YouTube content that I wish to view, by using either my smartphone or iPad.  Will only get better as more providers sign-on!  My only concern is that someone will figure out how to charge a monthly fee to use this device. Highly recommended.<br /><br />UPDATE: It works so well that I purchased a second one, as a gift for one of my kids. (A 40 year old kid.)
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This is a GREAT CD!!! There are 16 songs on it which make it a terrific buy for the money....I am in my late 50's and after listening to this I have dubbed John Legend the Peabo Bryson of the new Millennium.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|can not install.  like others it says not enough space.  please fix soon as i would like to try this app.
1401917232|4.0|This is Gary's third book of a trilogy (with DU and YIR). It is a very helpful book that explains A Course in Miracles and forgiveness in a very clear way for people with different backgrounds. It has a lot of personal history of Gary and his divorce from Karen and marriage to Cindy, plus other details of his life as Pursah with Arten. It also has explanations that were not in any of his books before, about health and the in-between life and lessons from Thomas and Thaddaeus. I love Gary. He is funny and down to earth and he is a dedicated teacher. Still by far my favorite book of the trilogy is the Disappearance of the Universe. Overall, it is a very good read, especially if you are A Course of Miracles student.
B003L20ICE|3.0|Thank you for being so quick to send the video to me. I haven't had a chance to view it, but will do so soon.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|my friends play it on their phone all the time and it looks really fun but it wont install on my kindle and it says kindle tablet edition. what's up with that? pleeeeeeease fix. I want to play it soooooo bad
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|The special effects were well on par with the latest movies. The storyline followed closely enough. It was the sort of thing you might imagine took place during the intervening years.
B0064W667Y|5.0|An interesting wrinkle to the classic Fairy Tale; Modernity meets the Medieval and Mythological.<br /><br />Good old-fashioned fun with a new twist.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|To say The Fault in our Stars by John Green is amazing is a understatement. Beautifully written to the point where you fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus. \\"MY thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations.\\" Must read.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|And if that's not enough return for your CD dollars, then pass this one by.<br /><br />Some perspective:<br />The prediction of his future manager, Jon Landau (\\"I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen\\") turned out to be extremely prescient. When I first heard Born to Run, I thought Landau was probably right. It was like nothing I could recall hearing before. The man we used to call \\"The Boss\\" has been responsible for some of the most exciting song themes, lyrics and records of the past (gasp!) three decades. Not now, though.<br /><br />Well, so what?  Anybody who is still actively creating ANYTHING noteworthy more than thirty years after they begin--and managing to do it differently, as Springsteen still is--deserves all the labels, from \\"brilliant\\" and \\"amazing\\" to \\"unrivalled.\\" Then, there are the concerts. One of my saddest regrets is that I never got to see him and the E Street band perform between 1980 and 1995. So, yeah, I'm a great fan.<br /><br />But today, it is hard to imagine that Bruce Springsteen will be asked to compile another \\"The Essential Bruce Springsteen,\\" the 2003 3-disc (should have been 4!) retrospective. Not when he puts out releases such as Wrecking Ball. Ten years on, the stuff of memorable songs (hit singles  and wonderful album tracks) just isn't there.<br /><br />Wrecking Ball is, for the most part, just one big working-class wail; a celtic-styled rant-and-chant that reveals a paucity of the finely-honed lyricism we used to get, even (maybe especially,) when Bruce was in a troubled personal period. One sure sign: new levels of repetition, not even 4-line choruses, but just phrases, repeated over and over.  (Just two examples: This Depression's line, \\"I need your heart\\": 10 times. Wrecking Ball's \\"Bring On Your Wrecking Ball\\": 14 times.)  Concert favourite, Land of Hope and Dreams, reworks the \\"train\\" metaphor so often used by others, (most successfully perhaps, in Peace Train by the OJays) that it borders on cliché.From Bruce Springsteen? Ouch!<br /><br />One redeeming cut: Jack of All Trades. Great song, (Oh, that ominous final verse!) but sadly, this cut only serves to remind us of what has come before and could have been again.<br /><br />Gimme Thunder Road, Held Up Without A Gun, Hungry Heart, I'm On Fire, State Trooper, and--yeah, any day--Dancing in the Dark. You got your favorites, I got mine, but nothing on Wrecking Ball will be added to my long list--and maybe not yours, either.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I had played the free version and didn't think nothing much of it. The full version makes it very clear why Rovio is a top developer. Kudos for the beautifully designed game!
B0076HNMU0|5.0|I have found that many of the TV series that I enjoyed when they were first broadcast, don't hold up well over time. This is one of the exceptions. Twin Peaks is the kind of program that requires a willingness of suspend disbelief if your expectation is a detective mystery. It is written as both a soap opera and as a satire on soap operas--and on that level it is often over the top funny. There are other influences that went into the brew such as the horror movie genre, Alice in Wonderland, and suspense movies--it is hard not to find an homage to whatever you might imagine. The acting and direction make a combination of weirdly original characters and deliberately caricatured stock characters work together in a way that holds up quite well as an actual work of art (that was broadcast on TV!). The series probably would have been an enduring hit now on a cable channel that didn't require the big ratings of the Big Four broadcast networks, but it only went two seasons back in the day. What a shame!<br /><br />So, what is it all about? Greed and virtue, lust and love, the nature of reality, and donuts.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was the best book so far in the series! I stayed up late and woke up early to read this book!
B00D6QUMWG|5.0|Anna is the best Opera singer and the most beautiful and talented. I have seen a few Operas with her singing, but it is never enough.  We want more and more all the time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Nothing to say it works great on my Kindle and I also play on my computer. Since I put on my Kindle it is easy for me to grab it in the night and have some fun. Thanks
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|It is a good movie, the acting is good, but not enough music.  I really thought that the movie would be more musical.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|I love this show. When it's over I always want to watch another and another. My favorite show of all time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is just so fun to play :) also I was up so late last night just playing it my eyes hurt this morning
B004XNGKBS|5.0|If you want to use your Kindle in a more traditional way, this program will be very useful for you as sometimes writting by hand is more enjoyable than typing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Crafty person and teaching preschool and this app go hand and hand.  I love having it on my Kindle and pull up my crafts for school on their and on my phone.  I am a pinterest addict
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Neat game. Needs a new driver but  love that cars don't break. Dislike that the levels never end<br /><br />All an all petty neat game to kill time an test you
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Love this app and my almost 3 year old can use to really good to see the videos that she want so to see.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Much more interesting than I expected.  Very well written and some surprises.  The characters were easy to relate to.  4 star.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I have never been much of a Star Trek fan. Mostly because I saw the worst part of the Wrath of Kahn when I was 7 and was totally traumatized. However, the new Star Treks are so fun and a great retelling/revision of the original stories...<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />What I LOVE about this movie is that Benedict Cumberbatch's character *totally* has you going and feeling sorry for him, and then BLAMMO- he turns. It's been years since I've been played like that in a movie. It was really fun to experience. I also liked how they twisted things around at the end- totally unexpected, totally fun. We bought the movie because we liked it so much in the theater.. Will definitely be watching this again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game in the hole world! Love it! Please download this game! Have a nice day!<br /><br />I hope you download this game.
B00E9P959O|5.0|We bought this years ago when it first was released (Spouse is a Rush fan) I liked it as far as Rush Goes. But my spouse *really* wanted the new version so we ordered. It's impressive. Great rich new sound. This album is back in the rotation on a pretty regular basis now.
B000FIMHJ4|4.0|Ordered for one song only; however the remainder of the album seems interesting as well.  I have enjoyed the album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just started playing.  I'm addicted.  I play when ever I can.  I am still learning home to play.  Good job!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Of course I enjoyed this DVD set.  Downton Abbey may be one of the best of the Masterpiece Classic Series aired by PBS.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Kaleb is now in my top five heroes. It was amazing learning all his secrets and seeing what truly held his devotion through everything.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun time waster but can buy with real money but runs ok as free app without spending money.  Ill keep it as a game app
B000054BF2|5.0|One of their best albums in my opinion. It is a rare glimpse in a moment in time, truly powerful period.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|THis book sucked me in from the start and kept me guessing the whole way through.  I didn't really like either of the main characters but I cared enough about them to want to know what would happen to them.
B007SAP7S0|5.0|If you loved these albums then, wait till your hear and see all the goodies that are in these editions.
0071771263|1.0|This book is very good and i don't have any complains with the the format of the book. In fact, I am very happy with the quality of the questions provided. The only problem that bothered me was the CD sent along with this book. I am very upset because it stopped working after few days of the purchase. Now, I am not being able to do the exercises of listening, speaking and writing. It would be really great of the seller, if they could send me an another CD because without a proper functioning CD, my purchase is a total waste and with the exams coming near, I am not being able to continue my practice.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very entertaining game with fairly good graphics. Recommend for any horse enthusiast. The horse is quite realistic as is the rest of the game. All in all good game and and its fun
B005FUTBWS|1.0|First, this film can easily be summed up in one phrase...a cult versus sodomizers versus the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the plot is so far from reality that I had to fast-forward through half of the film. When you see a film, you expect the filmmakers will ask you to suspend your beliefs slightly in order to enjoy their film, but these filmmakers ask for a complete rejection of reality.<br /><br />Second, what does the title of this movie, \\"Red State,\\" have anything to do with the plot!?! It could not be in reference to American conservatism or communism because these are absent from the tale.<br /><br />Basically, \\"Red State\\" feels like the script was written, and continually updated, on the set as the crew and actors begat this small monstrosity. Please do not waste a moment of your life on this oddity.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a marvelous film. Hoffman and his stellar cast are engaging from the opening scene. What a joy to watch this cast, most of which were former vocalists, singers and musicians. Billy Connolly is a unique, gifted actor, has an impeccable sense of the special nuances within scenes, he is extraordinary. The music of course, is fabulous. Lastly, the message of this film is for all ages. Hoffman and this cast succeed in showing vitality, charisma, respect, love and values are still strong in those in their golden years, and we of the younger set should take notice. There is much to learn from them and most off all...appreciate who they are.
B00471TLZS|5.0|A classic horror movie, while some of the special effects were slightly dated, I do believe they still hold up to the test of time. Good fun and good scares to be had for all.
B000063DGC|5.0|A fantastic album that is enjoyable to listen to start to finish. I typically stay away from live recordings in general, but this album is an exception. This album is a great 'tribute' to Randy Rhoads, who died far to young. I still can not get passed the irony of the song Flying High Again, and I still think its kind of odd that it was chosen to be included on the album.
B00CH3QLG0|5.0|Just a dream! Love every single song on the album!!!! Can't believe that they're brothers just mixing music together. Insane.
B008M86IXU|5.0|has always  i am never disappointed in there music a wonderful dvd  concert well performed great audio and video when the dvd has finished there are 2 great cds to  keep you going. i  recommend this to any csn fan
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!  Very entertaining I look forward to playing it everyday so I can try to win in the daily free tournament.  Also enjoy the variety of games.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I was completely satisfied. Product came fast and I enjoyed watching the series.Im looking forward to purchasing the other seasons in the future on amazon
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Wonderful book to read. One of those that leave the reader sad that the characters' stories are ending. Well written in a way that keeps the reader wanting more at the end of each chapter. The title is misleading, however. The book is so much more than flowers...it's about people.
B0091REZMW|5.0|i love it completely.<br /><br />its great in achieving u with awards.and very mysterious.its good for kids 12 and up totally
0307476073|5.0|This is a fantastic adventure!! I loved it! Very interesting personal challenge .....that we can all relate to!! I have purchased more books and given to my friends!!
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|This movie is wonderful, absolutely amazing! The stop animation is awe inspiring, I love this movie and the crazy amount of work that went into making it. Not as dark as the book and still suitable for kids! (could be a little scary for the younger ones) Totally recommend buying, 10/10
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging, addictive, well thought out game. I enjoy this game very much. I wish wait times for extra lives were a little shorter, however.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I laughed out loud quite a bit and found this movie entertaining, but it is more of a chick flick.
B003DDKAT2|4.0|It's an amazing movie except for Tom Cruise whose blonde hair and way over the top acting are to ridiculous to believe. Stupid Cruise.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, its super fun and very addicting. once you start its going to be hard to stop
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Keeps you active and gives you new goals all the time. Good fun for people who like a good challenge and mind racing.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Really enjoy this app.  Game is very entertaining and full of surprises.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves games
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This movie is unusual in the immense size of its cast and in its multiple-plot structure. Within a cast of about fifty people, over a dozen play starring roles.  This might sound like a recipe for disaster, but somehow it works beautifully.  The basic idea behind this effort consists of using many male-female pairs of actors to portray the many different kinds of encounters and outcomes that can occur and result when male and female humans find themselves in close proximity to each other.  The outcomes of these multiple relationships are tremendously varied and best thought of as scattered along a spectrum ranging from tragedy to ecstasy.  The movie does not present one complete portrayal, then a second complete portrayal and so on until the movie's end.  In contrast to that \\"stepping stone\\" approach, the movie actually introduces a bit of the first portrayal, a bit of the second and so on through to the last portrayal, then starts over with a second bit of information on the first portrayal.  In other words, the movie repeatedly \\"tunes up\\" the viewer's understanding of how each relationship is progressing.  Although the movie treats most of the portrayals as of equal value, it places greater than usual emphasis on the relationship that builds to a thrilling peak involving the Prime Minister of England (Hugh Grant) and his voluptuous office assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon).  In a serious portion of the movie illustrating the character of the Prime Minister's work, The President of the United States (Billy Bob Thornton) arrives and proves himself full of assumed superiority and entitlement rights to insult or flirt with anyone in his presence.  The interactions between the actors playing the President, Prime Minister and Natalie are brilliantly portrayed and leave me thinking Thornton is an acting genius, even when playing a mildly despicable person and even when he wears a John Deere cap while playing semi-dumb during interviews.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I always thought the original recording sounded flat. This is much better. The music, as always with the Band, is both impeccably played and explosive at the same time. Whenever they play with Dylan it starts to get dangerous. No different here.
0767827716|5.0|On the first day of his senior year, physically limited and nerdy Arnie Cunningham wearing non-stylish horn-rimmed glasses narrowly escapes a beating from bully Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander), largely because of intervention by his best friend Dennis (John Stockwell).  Soon after this, Arnie falls in love with a rusty, red-and white 1958 Plymouth Fury owned and named \\"Christine\\" by decrepit and sleazy-looking George LeBay (Roberts Blossom).  Going against the advice of his domineering parents and best friend Dennis, Arnie buys the junky-looking car and becomes obsessed with the idea of overhauling it until it is in perfect condition and he becomes popular and highly respected as its owner.  He is wildly successful in this enterprise and becomes close to his pretty and popular girlfriend Leigh (Alexandra Paul).  Arnie soon finds out that Christine has a mind of her own.  The movie flawlessly presents a series of incidents revealing Christine's likes and dislikes, her sense of justice, willingness to act in the name of justice and ability to repair herself, regardless of the extent of damage she might receive.  When bully Repperton and his gang viciously trash Christine, she restores herself, then goes after and kills each and every one of those who showed her disrespect.  Christine becomes a formidable threat to anyone who would harm Arnie, herself or anyone who interferes with the bonds of love that exist between her and Arnie.  Knowledge of this frightens Leigh who thinks Christine might be jealous of her and want to kill her.  Leigh becomes certain that she is right and asks for help from Arnie's best friend Dennis.  Dennis agrees with Leigh and decides he must kill Christine before she creates a tragedy by murdering Leigh.  This leads to a thrilling battle scene in a garage housing Christine and massive construction machinery with a frightened Leigh proudly watching a heroic Dennis using stored, engine-driven machinery to attack Christine who fights back viciously and repairs each damaging blow.  Dennis appears to be the winner and the movie's surprisingly startling ending sheds light on the truth of this.  I thought the casting, direction and acting on this film were superb.  it is the mother of all \\"machine with a mind of its own\\" stories.
B000005EJL|4.0|Track listing is incorrect????<br />Although my CD cover lists only 11 songs there are actually 12 songs on the CD.  The 10th track is called Give Me A Chance and is not listed here or anywhere on the album cover.  The remaining tracks move down one in order.<br /><br />The unlisted track is horrible and maybe that is why it isn't listed.<br /><br />The CD, with the 12 tracks, is 70 minutes long.  The sound quality if very good, especially for a CD from 1987.<br /><br />After Supertramp's Free as a Bird and Roger Hodgsen's Hai Hai, I had given up on Supertramp.  But, I just bought the album and was pleasantly surprised.  It is not great throughout but does have some great songs on it.  It also has some very bad songs.<br /><br />Only Rick Davies and John Anthony Helliwell remain from the most famous version of Supertramp (Helliwell was not on the first two Supertramp albums).  Chris Hart who joined for the Free as a Bird tour is also here on keyboards and vocals.  The is a guitarist but the guitar work is mostly subdued.  There is also a trumpet player who adds a new dimension to the music.<br /><br />There are some great songs, like the It's a Hard World, Some Things Never Change, anc C'est What?  They are a little more jazzy and bluesy than past Supertramp material.  Helliwell really shines.<br /><br />But, then there are the really horrible songs that are hard to get through, like Live to Love you and Give Me A Chance.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Gotta love the music!  And the story is fun, of course.  But, from another era and the moral, at the end, is to become sleazy to win your guy.  So, apart from that, it's colorful and entertaining.
B00AEBB9CS|1.0|I was really upset with this purchase. First of all, it was in a flimsy paper case and not in a plastic protector like every other DVD.<br /><br />However the movie was great
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We love this movies. The comedy is a perfect blend of goofy childish with adult jokes tucked in. Adam Sandler did a great job with this animation!
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|how do you get rid of the glitches on the last thing in the royal chapter? other than that great game
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is fun and its also hard having to get all the money to upgrade my guns because you have to get all these upgrades to beat other harder levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO COOL!!!!!! I'VE NEVER PLAYED A GAME SO RAD BEFORE AND ITS JUST AWESOMER THAN SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!!!
B008EL25LE|4.0|If you enjoy games that are the matching 3 symbols variety then you will enjoy this one. I hadn't ever seen this game but it sounded like something I would like and I AM having fun with it. As you progress the levels get increasing harder with prizes awarded as you finish them . I'm not very far along in the game but I do enjoy the graphics and the music and the story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like Temple run 2 but whenever I go to play the game it always glitches in the middle of the game and I lose, but the game itself is very fun and entertaining.
B000O176Q6|5.0|One of my first Blu-rays ever purchased. Big fan of Bruce Lee films and have over the years, upgraded the movies from VHS to DVD and now to Blu-ray and I must say, I am WOWED!! Between the 5.1 surround and the HD quality picture...it was like the excitement of watching this movie for the first time. What particularly stands out in my mind (keep in mind that I'm such a fanatic and have seen this movie so many times that I can recite the entire movie word for word) is the part where Mr. Han welcomes the contestants to the island. I always knew that Han was wearing black and gold, but thanks to the HD quality picture, I only now noticed after all these many years and repeated viewings that the gold on Han's clothes actually sparkled like glitter. That simple little detail blew my mind. Anyhow this was a very satisfying purchase with lots of extras that will make any Bruce Lee aficionado happy. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive I can't help but to play it whenever I get the chance. It's just like the easy version of Temple Run but even more addictive.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Everything in the previous &#34;Collector's DVD&#34; version but with added bonuses not available before. The obvious is this new packaging which I think is pretty neat, but the real kicker is the never before released in the U.S. &#34;Japanese Cinematic Version&#34; possessing footage  that was edited out of the U.S. release.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Not done yet but so good. Makes you want to keep reading and discover more about the characters. Very quickly absorbing
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My wife and I love the show &#34;Suits&#34;.  The story line and plot move very quickly.  There is plenty of conflict to keep you very interested in the next issue.
B00F880BWG|5.0|While this first episode started off slow, the experienced &#34;DeadHead&#34; knows that cannot last.  And by the end of the episode, we were proven right.  Cannot wait to see where this goes but I must say, the song &#34;It's Raining Men&#34; will never have the same connotation.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can find diamond iron and gold. You need to get this app. Survival and creative. Get this great app.
B0060MYKTY|3.0|Jeremy Irons is so miscast as Rodrigo Borgia, (the fiendish Spaniard, who, as the utterly corrupt fifteenth century Pope, helped set the stage for the Reformation), in this thoroughly unconvincing performance that he is laughable. Helping Jeremy/Rodrigo is his &#34;evil' daughter, Lucrezia, played by the sweet Holiday Grainger, who acts as if she couldn't poison a family kitchen rats, much less her husbands, Also getting into the act is Joanne Whalley, up to God-only-knows-what, as Rodrigo's former mistress, and the mother of his children. Francois Arnaud takes up the slake, and there is plenty of that, as Rodrigo's son, a Cardinal. Some other misbegotten actor plays Alexander VI's &#34;enemy&#34; Cardinal Della Rovere, in a forgettable performance. A big Show Time cable mess in Blue Ray. Amazon does it's usual excellent job as the seller.
0064430227|4.0|This was one of my favorite books growing up as a kid and now my two year old loves this book just as much as I did and still do....a classic
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Love the Harry Potter movies. Sorry they had to end. But I guess all good things must come to an end.
0805047905|5.0|Great durable sturdy book that holds up to my two year old flip each page and pointing at the animal while trying to sound out each brightly colored picture.....a classic book to read to your child!!!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|If you were hoping for &#34;Cell Block Nine&#34; (or whatever that old cable show was about a women's prison), don't bother. There are no riots, no shanking, no catfights in &#34;Orange is the New Black.&#34;<br /><br />Piper Kerman's memoir is more for the thinking person. What does she learn about herself? What does she learn about others? And more importantly, what does she learn about the justice system in the United States?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Finally available for Kindle Fire. Works great. I was about to get rid if my Kindle because I couldn't get this game. Now we need Pet Rescue.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is challengeing and fun.  I enjoy playing on my free time and I don't get bored. I like the graphics and difficulty level.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I've seen this movie 5 times now. It's awesome, and the technology is amazing. I hope they do another one. Or at least another Avengers movie. Great Movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am happy that Amazon put the Candy Crush app for Kindle Fire HD back on. Was playing Candy Swap, but it quit working. And Candy Crush is hard to play on a mobile phone. Yay!
B00CCKWUNG|5.0|Great movie! Got it very fast, and in great condition! Very good overall. Love the steel metal packaging! Definitely would recommend.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Received as scheduled and very easy to unpack and install. Use it with an iPad and Hulu+ for shows that we missed. At first was not supported by Hulu but they issued an update which allows us to use the Chromecast with Hulu. Worth every penny!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the interesting twist at the end.  I wIll check out other books by this author.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Loved the movies, love the Minions....Installed this game and deleted without 10 minutes.  Couldn't get past the first level without having to BUY my way out.  That didn't happen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy! I never thought this day would be here. I can finally play candy crack on my very on tablet! YAY!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This is a Face Book game. You are allowed a limited number of lives, and cannot continue playing for a delay of up to 8 Minutes, after which you get only 1 life. You can procure more for continued play at 99 cents apiece. If you want a reasonable number of lives without purchasing for an exorbitant amount of cash, you are forced to wait til the next day. I am waiting for a paid version that will allow for continuous uninterrupted play. Until then we are stuck with this tease.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is great. I have been waiting for Candy Crush on my Kindle it works great. Keep up the great work.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|really like this kind of movie, even though it is a bit weird.  after he was gone so long how can he be sure he is welcome back
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again Stephen King tackles alcoholism and psychic phenomena, lining up little Danny in adult life for facing and fighting his daddy's demons. It's bitterly plausible that he takes to drink if drinking shuts down psychic perception. Very cool scary King, old fashioned scary King, you will really enjoy this if you liked The Shining. Great interesting characters.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|It was very interesting, I was flabbergasted by the whole chain of events. If you watch this movie without reading what it is about, you will be taken by surprise!
075669910X|5.0|Exactly as described and much more comprehensive than I expected. Deep, thorough listings of so many creatures I hadn't heard of and most, if not all of the ones I was familiar with, even obscure ones. Unfortunately a few of the absent ones are favorites, I could not find Utahraptor in there because groups like raptors got only two or three representative species as opposed to the several famous species that they really did.<br /><br />The illustrations surprised me because I didn't read the fine print. I expected a variety of paleo-art in different styles or one or two artists dominating. Instead, it's lush and photo-heavy with gorgeous computer created, realistic images. Most of them are photographic and natural looking, as if you had a camera you sent throughout the past. A few look obviously digital-painted but many are so well crafted they might as well be good nature photography. Poses, textures, lighting, color harmony, light physics, it's all very real. Very few have unnatural hard edges to give it away.<br /><br />In addition there are many good photos of fossils, skeletal mounts and museum reconstructions, occasional taxidermy photos if a species was extant recently enough to have taxidermy in museums. The text is concise but information packed and engaging. This is most of all a wonderful reference book. .<br /><br />It's well indexed and bound. Thick, heavy and intense but an easy read. It's laid out so that it's easy to look up something specific by its time period and it covers the plants and ecology as well as the animals.<br /><br />I am a writer, what I wanted in a reference book, this is the best one yet. With the detailed descriptions and fossils of undersea life and botany as well as land animals, it's easier to get a feel for the entire period on something I've looked up. When I set a story or novel in Earth's evolutionary past, this is the book that gives me enough detail I'm less likely to make huge blunders like putting in Jurassic grass.<br/><br />I bought this to replace a rather old Encyclopedia of Prehistoric Life which had mostly line drawings but was comprehensive and covered all the major periods and groups of animals. I found myself turning to it more often than denser books because of how well it was organized and that it covered more than the Mesozoic. This one is bigger. Its large size gives room for more text and the blocks of text are often in relatively small type,often white on black. I wear magnifying glasses to read the text sometimes but it's always worth reading and goes into just that step more depth to make everything fall together well.<br /><br />It's nicely up to date, lushly illustrated and tremendously handy. I can't recommend it enough to the interested layman and it might even be useful to scientists and fossil hunters too with its wonderful breadth.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I re-read The Shining as it had been many years in between these 2 novels. It was a worthwhile read as it brought me back to the characters especially Danny and what happened at the Overlook Hotel.  It was time well spent while I waited for the release of Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />This is not a sequel but an expansion from Danny the traumatized little boy of the Shining, to Dan Torrence a man haunted by past experiences and challenged in a completely different way in Dr. Sleep .  I will not give away the plot of this story but can say it is completely captivating.  I have not finished this book, but hate to put it down, especially now that I am  about 70% into the story.  Let's just say it's another star in Stephen Kings stellar career.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down. Going for the third book while writing this. Katniss is so immature that she is becoming predictable.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it it's a cool way to stream but I wish it had more apps to it other than Netflix and YouTube
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I cried the whole way through this book but I think that's why I love it and that's why it's so memorable !! The feelings displayed in this book become your own !! Sometimes I find that bad but in this book it's welcomed and needed for the true meaning behind the story to become clear :)))
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun, challenging game that does not allow you to give up or cheat! Can't wait to see the next rooms.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Easy to follow yet complex enough to keep you intrigued. Definitely recommend. Can easily be read again and again. Great introduction to John Grisham
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the timer feature, and that I can adjust the individual sound volumes to create a perfect mesh to fit my mood. There's a good variety to mix and match for soothing custom sounds. My husband's recent deployment made me aware of a sound I never thought I'd miss, but would now love to have added to the library: SNORING!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I played on my friends ipad and then bought it it is realy fun but takes up to much space
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another hit Mr. King. A week of sleepless nights because I just had to find out what happened. Thank you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a good app for anyone. Minecraft makes you think and being creative and learn how to make things. I think mojang did a good job of making this app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series continues to dole out suprises like candy on Halloween. The series continued to thrill me. The events, costumes and scripts are fantastic and engaging.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book reminded me to slow down and appreciate everything. Christian, Hindu, Muslim. ...the Rabbi's & Henry's message is the same, love your family and respect all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Kept me interested! Kept me guessing and a little frustrated when I was having some problems figuring it out, but I kept at it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great, but a little hard too. If you are really good at puzzles and figures a lot of stuff this is the game for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am happy to finally have my candy crush for kindle. I have not had any problems so far, finger crossed. What I really love is that it works well with my Facebook, I have some games that won't accept or send gifts or help and this one works like a champ. I highly recommend this games.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Hated to see it end. The suspense from episode to episode is spectacular. Never knew where the deceit was coming from next.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints with his character development, and there were some amazing characters in Danny Torrence's adult life - some demons, some angels.  This book finds Dan Torrence as a troubled adult on a journey to overcome some haunting memories from his childhood, at times reconnecting with evil ghosts from the Overlook Hotel.  I found it hard to put the book down once I started it - a great sequil to one of my favorites from the past, The Shining.
B008Q09K2U|1.0|Disappointed. No comparison to other books by this author. Even money back would not compensate time wasted reading this book. I lack more words. End.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Just not sure about the game as of right now,  Will still play and let you know again, new to the game
B00ARN0YDS|3.0|This fourth installment in the Paranormal Activity franchise didn't really have some of the terrifying suspense that the previous three had. I think most of what was seen in the first three films were the video camera time lapses, that actually builds up the fear and suspense in the viewer's stomach that makes the film's horror factor more functional.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|The difficulty level is good... sometimes one needs to play a level many number of times to clear it. All in all a good time pass and a good tester of your reflexes.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is a fun little fun casual game with a nice mix of puzzles and hidden object. The graphics are beautiful but the storyline, like the first Magic Academy game, is rather silly. There's way too much dialogue but luckily it's easily to bypass.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|I have to admit that once I started playing, it was difficult for me to keep my phone down. The levels are not so difficult but you need to know when to use which power up. sometimes a power up of an earlier stage helps more to clear a stage at a later part of the game. One shortcoming of the game is that its too small, not enough stages to play. I'll recommend people to try this game out.
0545586178|5.0|This book is a great sequel to The Hunger Games.  The series is quite popular among the preteen set, and is a good book
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Theo game is one of my favorite gameloft games. Its a good way to have fun. A fun way to compete with each other. Also to test your skills.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Zombies, vampires, zombie-vampires, none of these things scare me.  This book, which is sort of a psychological and moral horror story is more frightening to me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would rate it a 10 if i could but there is no such thing. I love how there is a lotof levels and it keeps me occupied for hours.<br /><br />I would recomend 5+ to play this
B001G8XON0|5.0|Great film and music wonderful story and cast.was very satisfied with the bluray and hope to continue purchasing them from this seller.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie was very great. I loved the lessons that it taught considering how most young men of our days will rather leave stuffs for the woman today.  It really showed that when a baby is coming in it the responsibility of the whole family and not only the woman.  It was also funny and enjoyable to watch, the anxiety was right from the beginning.<br /><br />Again, people who dont see the need or importancerof having and raising children are in for great lessons
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can now play this on my Kindle now we need pet rescue and pawn stars keep up good work
6305428042|1.0|I love the movie Hocus Pocus but i dislike the actual dvd because it makes a loud noise every time we play it.
B00EJ9RIXA|1.0|If I could give negative stars I would. Completely USELESS. You have to have a different apps for it to work. You can't edit and when you try to view documents, it says &quot;webpage not found&quot;. Don't waste your money.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I got this game when it first came out. And I still play it today. The game is extremely well put together and fair. The controls are as good as they can get with a touch screen. It barely takes up any space (surprisingly) and plays out extremely well. My only complaint is that, as always, we do mot get the updates (at least for awhile).
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Get this app it is the best app ever I think except for subway surfers get that also. go on what r u waiting for.....
B009BWGQRE|4.0|A feal like you were there adventure drama.  Human endeavor under unpredictable and dangerous situations.  No spoilers so cannot say much more.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I loved playing this on my pc. I don't like that the kindle version doesn't always respond to the swipes and so you lose that game. Also, it isn't clear how you get extra turns from friends. All I see is more things you have to pay for.
0783114222|5.0|Excellent series. Tom Hanks and Ron Howard knock it out of the park.<br />My favorite is Spider. Story of building the LEM.<br />And story 1968<br />Photos of the Earth-rise from Lunar orbit are inspiring. And show God's awesome work.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|The Good - the special effects, the new cast.  I don't mind the Spock/Uhura love interest since I can accept the alternate timeline.<br /><br />The Bad - the story.  It's bad enough that I probably won't buy this movie.  Aren't there any writers left that can write something original?  They took a great cast and rehashed an old story line (albeit one of the best ones).  Now, if you're not a long-time Star Trek fan, maybe this won't bother you.  I suspect many of the 5-star reviews here are by such people.  At least the first movie with the new cast was an original story.<br /><br />Very disappointed with this movie but the new cast makes me give it 3 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game to the max!!! Many coworkers enjoy this game as well. Glad it came back to Kindle!
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|One of Bruce Willis' best films. While it should maybe be considered dark comedy considering the subject matter, it is hard to think of it that way since everything is treated so lightly, somewhat tongue-in-cheek. Besides Bruce Willis having an even more comedic role than usual, Mary-Louise Parker is a delight, as is Helen Mirren as an ex-MI6 sniper and John Malkovich as ex-CIA &#34;crazy man&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I spend my down time playing candy crush it works good on my kindle no lags or loading prablems
B001B7CNY2|4.0|Not a particularly pleasant movie in some respects, but still a great story, well told and acted. A fictional WWII epic loosely based on true stories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is great for kids and teens and its funny it has cool visuals and who doesn't like the minons
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|Remarkably good sound for period recordings.  Great singing.<br />Sleeves are thin cardboard and discs cannot be removed without<br />touching surfaces of the CD.  This should be improved
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome, as always. This book has a great cast of characters. Thanks, Stephen King, for letting us know what happened to little Danny Torrance! Great to read this right after &#34;Joyland&#34; by SK.
B0007Y08I8|5.0|When I heard about this one being released I was at the first showing at my local cinema.  Almost fell off my seat laughing and haven't stopped since.  Pull it out and watch it whenever I need a laugh, which is most of the time, and it never gets old.  A true humour classic.  Love singing along with the songs.  Matt and Trey are brilliant.  Haven't yet seen The Book of Mormon, so until then, in my mind, this is their best.
0992251656|5.0|This is a very intricate game and I was very pleased to see that it is set up for even one player.  I'm a die-hard Browncoat, so of course I love it.  I haven't played the game yet... Honestly, it will take a while to read all the directions. I wish the little game pieces were metal (they are plastic) but maybe someday they will put out a set.  Firefly/Serenity fans will be pleased to know that all the favorites from the 'Verse are included - even Wash's dinosaur - although it's only a cardboard version, the game directions suggest using a toy Dino in it's place - they could have included one :)  No matter, I have my own from my dog's \\"Wash\\" Halloween costume from a few years ago!  Keep Flyin'!
B000SGRONM|4.0|... and finally found it affordably for Kindle. (I'm retired and on a fixed income.)  It's not my favourite of David's books but was highly enjoyable none the less and didn't disappoint.  I can't recommend Sedaris' books highly enough.  Any and all of them.  He's a national treasure.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Great movie!! Not as good as the first one but the kids still love it.  Since it is a Pixar film they make it so adults can enjoy as well.
1878424319|5.0|This is a powerfully compact book with poignant life lessons we should all apply daily.  Don't take anything personally, be impeccable with your word, don't make assumptions, and always do your best.  This should be the new curriculum for first grade.  The world would be a completely different place.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|The movie is full of action, Charlize Theron is such a great woman. Do not miss this movie. You'll regret
B002LFPAUC|5.0|love the show....very funny...wish there were more episodes...too bad it isn't on the air any more...would recommend to anyone<br />who likes  English humor.
B008JFUR10|1.0|The effects as in any 190 million $ budgeted movie are top notch BUT the story, the horrible acting, the absolute nonsense of it is mind blowing.  The actors deliver their lines like \\"what the hell did I just say\\" \\"this is too silly to take seriously\\"  They obviously were playing the picture to the Chinese as that is one of the World's largest markets for US movies now and of course being capitalist they follow the money.  I can't believe the good reviews I couldn't watch it it was so ridiculous, goofy.  I thought Ridley Scott's Prometheus was completely wacko....well it's is a cinematic masterpiece next to this pile of nonsense.  It was just giant machines and monsters smashing the hell out of each other for what seemed liked hours.  What possessed WB to buy into this.  It in essence bombed in the US.  Come on guys take some of the Arthur C. Clarke books or some other great SF works give it a creative, intelligent director and for god sakes not the same old machines, monsters, good looking guy meets good looking girl done one hundred and ninety million times.  Enough crap already.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|There are only ten levels so far but they are fun. There are usually several steps in each level which makes you really think. Challenging and fun!
1623650003|5.0|The combination of the horrific crime with which the book opens, the quirky pained personality of the protagonist, and an elegant writing style had me thinking \\"this may be the best crime novel I have ever read.\\"  At that point I looked at the cover and saw the sticker that said \\"Winner Best Crime Novel 2013.\\" Duh. Far superior to Steig Larsen, comparable in quality to James Lee Burke (though darker). For fans or Scandinavian crime writers I can only compare him to James Thompson in regard to expressing the darkness of evil and tortured souls.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Its good add to the series.  I loved the movie it took a different path to the story.  I am now renergized to see another part and hope its just as good as this one.  The action and transformations were awesome.
B006ANJ4BW|5.0|Love the comics, a huge fan of the books and played all the videogames to death.  This movie really captures the dark, cunning, brutal warrior Conan is supposed to be.  Unfortunately the movie falls prey to a lot of nasty critics.  So many fan boys of comics and novels cry (myself included) when a movie comes out that completely ignores the source material.  But then when a director actually attempts to ignore typical Hollywood formula and make a film that not only isn't ashamed of the source material but actually celebrates it the same fan boys (not myself) then trash the movie for being to cartoony or too campy.  Anyway I loved it, watch this movie over and over, glad to see others love the movie as much as I did.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I am a fan of the series and when I learned of this I had to get it.  The series continues on and with a few improvements it does exceed the story.  I like the fact the persona of the series is still the same and it exceeds it.  Great movie.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I LOVE the Star Trek films and I have to say that the idea of a pre-quel kinda worried me.  BUT I have to say that this movie DOES NOT disappoint!!!  It was well done.  I was with a Star Trek &#34;Virgin&#34; when I watched this movie at the theater and he LOVED it too!!!  It is really nice to continue to see the characters we Trekkies fell in love with: Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Bones (the orignal...lol'), etc...  Love to see more of those people's lives and experiences.  I admit that I'm a fan of the extended series that have been invented but am much more interested in the &#34;Original&#34; characters that started the whole thing!!!  Hope to see more films in the future!!!???
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If you're a fan of authentic rock music played by humans (not machines), you'll enjoy this documentary. The back story about this recording studio and all of the amazing music that was recorded there is both revealing and moving.  Dave Grohl is especially inspirational.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City of Bones, the first book in the popular Mortal Instruments series, was to me, a great book. It takes place in a small apartment in New York, where the main character is a 15 year old girl named Clary, and her best friend Simon. Through an incident at a club, Clary meets three demon hunters named Jace, Isabelle, and Alec. She is the only person that can see them, and this scares her. Soon after, she discovers her apartment destroyed and her mother missing. This leads to her discovering a whole other world her mother kept her from, along with a lot of secrets. She befriends Jace, Isabelle, and Alec, and they go on a big adventure with several twists and turns to find her mother and the Mortal Cup, a very valuable magical object that they need to prevent from getting into the wrong hands.<br /><br />Even though the book was a bit slow in the beginning, once it gets started, it’s a rollercoaster of plot twists and surprises you don’t see coming, and this is when I was really amazed by the book. Personally, how unexpected this book really is what makes it so good. Of course there is more than just that. Besides turns you never see coming, there is also the humor added in by Jace. He is extremely full of himself, and his witty comments and flirting make you laugh throughout the whole book. Additionally, this book can convey many emotions, which is what a truly good book should do. You will be shocked and bewildered, angry to the point of wanting to throw the book at the wall, and just a little bit teary eyed. You really feel like you are going on a journey with the characters.<br /><br />Also, besides the fact that the main characters are demon hunters, they are very relatable. They are just normal people, and I think you can find a small part of yourself in every character. You wouldn’t think that you could find anything relatable in a book involving demons, werewolves, vampires and more, but you can, which only contributes to the enjoyment of this book.<br /><br />The book is pretty long, over 400 pages, but if you stick with it it is worth reading. It’s not a very difficult book, and to me any teenager can read it and understand it. The author is also very good at description, giving you a clear image in your mind of who the characters look like, and what the settings are like. The story flows at a good pace, and overall it is written very well.<br />In conclusion, I loved this book. Like I said, it’s a bit slow to start, but if you just wait, you will be in for a fantastic reading experience that will leave you in a state of shock for a while once you finish. I highly recommend this book to any teenager that enjoys a lot of fantasy mixed with humor and drama.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|This album is 100% worth your money. A brilliant Carcass album that stands against anything Carcass recorded in the '90s. Yes, even Heartwork. This is a devastating, old school, but somehow completely fresh sounding effort in melodic death metal. Buy it, then see them when they tour.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I love this game.. Enjoy it as much as the first fruit drop game. This is much better than candy crush for sure!
B003AVMUSG|2.0|I am not able to rate this toy because shortly after I placed the order I was informed that it was out of stock and probably would not be re-stocked.  When I placed the order the page said that there were two in stock but I guess not.  I was contacted quickly by the seller and then just as quickly they refunded my money.  I have no problem with the seller as they acted very fast and in my best interest.  However, I am very unhappy because I thought I had finally located this toy and I now have a little boy who is going to be very disappointed because that is the only thing that he wants for Christmas and the item does not seem to be available any place.
B005COO1X6|3.0|The story is good or to be more accurate the story fragment is good. I was not expecting a complete book or novella but I was expecting a complete short story; beginning, middle and end. All I got was a beginning and a partial middle but no end.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This story challenges your morals about rights to live or die.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a wonderful lesson in compassion and empathy. The plot is engaging and not preachy. I read it with my eleven year old son and would recommend it to any parent as a great read aloud.  Or to any teacher as a thought piece on the nature of bullying.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The book is difficult to stop reading once one has started.<br /><br />I don't quite agree with the review that characterizes this book as a \\"thriller.\\" There are no action scenes at all, and \\"The Circle\\" could hardly be characterized as exciting. It doesn't matter. The book is extraordinarily compelling. It is more realistic, and far more plausible, than \\"1984\\" was in its day.  This is in part because \\"1984\\" was set more than three decades into the future (it was written in 1949), whereas \\"The Circle\\" is set in the not-too-distant future. \\"The Circle\\" is scarier than \\"1984\\" for the same reason; it features known technologies and applications that we can easily imagine developing or that are already in their infancy. The dystopia doesn't even feature an evil government as did \\"1984\\"; indeed, government spying is never even mentioned at all.<br /><br />Adding to its realism is the fact that this book is virtually devoid of symbolism. It is written in a matter-of-fact style, with straightforward descriptions that anyone who has visited Silicon Valley companies can easily recognize.  In one little tribute to \\"1984,\\" Eggers does come up with several three-word all-caps slogans that update the classic \\"FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\\" slogans from Orwell.<br /><br />Several other low-star reviews point out some shortcomings in the writing, and I agree with them:  too superficial in many spots (but so is \\"1984\\"), complete omission of any online users who object to invasive technologies, plot twists developed and then dropped (e.g. the unnecessary sex), too simplistic (using letters from a former boyfriend as a way of making points that the book should have been able to make more elegantly with better writing). Nonetheless, this book needed to be written.  The way \\"The Circle\\" drives relentlessly into a dystopian future, backed by the best-and-brightest minds who are too driven and too young to question what they are doing, is masterful.<br /><br />I'm an attorney and my area of expertise is Internet law; I have written books and articles and spoken many times on the subject. Yet despite my substantial online involvement, I have always refused to join Facebook. This book is the best explanation yet regarding why.

B001IYCMNA|4.0|I have had a WAP4410N on my home network for several years. I upgraded from a WAP54G in order to take advantage of the higher speed. One problem I ran into was flaky behavior on a PS3 when playing Netflix streaming movies. I never had any trouble with the WAP54G. I recently got a new smartphone and I wanted to set up its WiFi access. What I found was that the WAP4410N doesn't think the phone's MAC address is valid. I tried upgrading the firmware to the latest release (2.0.4.2). I have gotten pretty tired of rummaging on the net for information on getting around the problems.<br /><br />Update: I upgraded the firmware once again to 2.0.7.4 released Jan 21, 2014. The problems I have encountered appear to have been resolved. The release notes don't specifically indicate that a MAC address problem was fixed. I'm changing the rating and removing the caustic comments since the device is working. I wish it hadn't taken so long.

B00DW1WR14|3.0|This is what I call a positive negative review, meaning I'm not as fond of this album as others but I have nothing really negative to say about it or Pearl Jam.  I've been with these guys since the very beginning, and to say I'm a \\"fan\\" doesn't begin to describe how much I love this band.  Up until Backspacer, the only album I wasn't quite as fond of out of their catalog was the 2006 album known as \\"Avocado\\", although over time some of it grew on me; just not one I play often.  When Backspacer came out, I was all in; that was my favorite since Yield, which is my favorite Pearl Jam album.  As information started pouring out regarding this new album, I heard the excitement in the band which got me really excited about it.  Then I heard Mike say that it's \\"way better than Backspacer\\" and heard \\"Mind  Your Manners\\" and I was counting the days.  After hearing the album a few times now I disagree with Mike but I'm not saying he is wrong, I'm just saying that for me this is not way better than ANY of their albums, not just Backspacer.<br /><br />I enjoy the opening two rockers \\"Getaway\\" and \\"Mind Your Manners\\", and after a few listens I really enjoy \\"Sirens\\" and \\"Pendulum\\".  Aside from those and the title track there aren't many others on the album I would listen to on a regular basis.  I'm not disappointed in this album or in the band, this is just another \\"Avocado\\" for me, an album that for whatever reasons didn't grab me the way the others have.  In the big picture, it's hardly significant because after all this is Pearl Jam, the band whose music has been the soundtrack of my life.  Being a fan doesn't mean that you're automatically going to love every piece of music your favorite band makes, I think that's what is called being \\"biased\\".  I'll just have to wait to see what comes next but that won't be too hard with a huge catalog of amazing music to help me get by.  I'll still buy it because I will always support these guys and over time I may learn to appreciate it a little more.  Besides that, it just wouldn't feel right to leave a gap in my PJ library.  Of course I will see them on tour because they're amazing live.<br /><br />For anyone reading this review and feeling discouraged, let me remind you that there will always be albums you love that many people don't like and it makes you love it even more because it gives you that feeling of \\"they're all crazy\\".  Let this be one of those albums for you, allowing my subtle disapproval to stand as your motivation to love it more to spite me!  I love Pearl Jam, always have, always will, and I applaud the fact that they've never made the same album twice.  That kind of constant evolution means that now and then one may not appeal to someone as well as others, and I'm alright with that.  I'd love to hear from some of the other longtime fans, whether you agree or disagree.<br /><br />**UPDATE 10-30-13**<br />The album has been out for two weeks (and it's been \\"Ten\\" days since I first posted my review, haha).  Rather than beat the songs I like to death I've been giving some time to each of the ones I had dismissed.  So far, out of those tracks \\"Swallowed Whole\\" is the biggest \\"what was I thinking\\" moment; really like that one now.  Overall, I'm happy with the first 8 tracks (except for Infallible) and the rest I could do without, except for Yellow Moon.  That one took a few listens but glad it made it on the album; wish it was the closer.<br /><br />So, after giving it more of a chance the number of songs I enjoy has increased to 8 out of 12, but I stand by my initial review and rating because I still feel the same way about the album as a whole.  The impression I walk away with from this album (more than the last few) is that Mr. Vedder is not the shy angry guy he once was.  The intensity and ferocity from songs like \\"Go\\", \\"Animal\\", \\"Habit\\" and \\"Why Go\\" (to name a few) isn't lost but perhaps less organic as he's overcome his personal demons and the inspiration comes from a different place.  Of course the band still rocks and at times has more attitude and vigor than ever, but what excites me the most is that with each album you can tell that these guys really appreciate and respect each other in how they collaborate.  Always looking forward to what comes next from these guys!ce.

B008JFUR10|5.0|As I am sure most people are aware of by now, Pacific Rim was Guillermo Del Toro's love letter to Japanese anime and specifically the mecha genre.  Certainly if you are a fan of that genre (such as myself) Pacific Rim is much more enjoyable than someone who is not.  However, that is like saying you like peanut butter and jelly but love them together on a sandwich.  Point I'm trying to make, this was a sheer enjoyable film, that was pure quick-paced fun, and even pointing out the technical problems is hardly enough to warrant anyone from not seeing this shining example of the summer blockbuster.<br /><br />The movie chronicles a war humans wage with monsters they have dubbed kaiju, with the use of their human like giant robots dubbed Jaegers.  However, instead of focusing on the beginning of this conflict, most of the war is wrapped up very quickly before the opening credits, and from then on shows the last stand, after the Kaiju begin to win against the Jaegers.  That is all I feel comfortable giving away for the plot, since the movie does a good job pacing out its story with action.  The film might be a little over two hours, but it never feels like it.  In fact, you likely won't even realize it has been two hours till the end credits roll.<br /><br />Speaking of the action, every fight scene in the film is amazingly well executed.  This is some of the best CGI I have seen in a long time, using its strengths of being able to shot and make the impossible, while acknowledge it's weaknesses.  This is why the fights are all at night with some form of water helping to cover up both the Kaiju and Jaegers.  What you can see of them however, shows the incredible detail that went into these creations, and even though all the fights are at night, they all feel unique.<br /><br />I know there were a few critics in the professional circles that merely suggested this film was okay.  Being a loud action filled film with stereotypes.  I can't argue with them, butt he fact is, That was exactly the kind of film Del Toro wanted to make.  The characters were intently archetypes.  The inspiration was showcased with big loud fights.  This is one of the few films that knew exactly what it was, and went above and beyond that, succeeding to be entertaining throughout the entirety of its length, where other blockbusters will at best have one good scene, but are quickly forgotten.<br /><br />Let me make it simple.  Everyone needs to see Pacific Rim.  It is far to enjoyable of a film to slip into cult status.  Do you enjoy entertainment? Do you like fun? Pacific Rim shows there are still film makers who do.  That care more about doing what they want than winning oscars and getting the big bucks.  If you like fun, you owe it to yourself to, at the very least, rent Pacific Rim.
B002VHI8HC|4.0|finished Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay and gave it 3 stars.  After watching the whole series, I think the tv writers definitely took the best parts of this novel and created something much better than the book.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle so I can read pdf files  I used it last night to read the manual for my apple i4s.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a full fAll back to the original king. Danny is a grown man with man foibles. Very real ans likeable. Really liked it a lot
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the best book I've read in awhile. The voice of Charlie is overwhelmingly naive and thoughtful. It's amazing how the author makes you believe that he is truly a 16 year old boy by withholding the perfect amount of information to make your mind wander. I felt like I was back in high school facing the same things again that Charlie faced in this book. Sam, Patrick, Mary Elizabeth, Alice, and Brad were all very real characters, and I feel like I knew them as well as Charlie. I would recommend this book to high schoolers and anyone who wants to relive their high school days. This book will give you perspective and make you understand that everyone has their &#34;baggage&#34;.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Very exciting almost to the end and then a quick conclusion which  the reader knew would happen.<br />As you read  &#34;The Panther&#34; it is very absorbing and can't be put down but I was disappointed at how the author brings justice to the terrorist.<br />I still recommend it as a great read.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I think this was a well written, descriptive book about the time period. I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real life. I felt what they felt.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very sharp. What a story! All plots are so well thought, everything perfectly believable, characters perfectly developed. I just finished, and I'd savor in my memory a bit longer. I didn't like initially the ending. But what ending can this story have?
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I enjoyed it very much at the beginning! I couldn't put it down but I found the ending a bit unrealistic. The excitmnet that built up turned into a &#34;blah&#34; at the end. It's well written and I did love all the characters ....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush wasn't available on Kindle when I checked a while back  and it appeared out of nowhere and I've been playing ever since.  &quot;Thank You Amazon&quot;!
B006G4F8OW|5.0|if you a fan one piece you must buy this figure is great figure for great character, bandai had done great job for brook
B00ARIO7PO|5.0|The unique take on the Oldfield songs like &#34;Far above the clouds&#34; are great but different. Not over the top. I would recomend this album for any fans of Mike.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|AMAZING BOOK!!!!!!!!!<br />I Loved It<br />IT IS A MUST READ<br />IT MADE ME BELIEVE MORE AND MORE AS I READ IT
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was challenging but not frustrating.  I really enjoyed searching for objects and solving the puzzles.  I hope they have new levels soon.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone in my family has it and I have been waiting for nearly a hole flipping year! It's fun and challenging. I love the graphics too.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Doctor Who is magical and charming and Amy, Rory and River Sun make it a different type of family. This is a great show to watch with the kids. It is imaginative and the differences in the characters opens up our minds to other possibilities that life may have to offer. Don't miss this!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Um, I know people love this game... but I don't see the big attention for this, its just a rip off of bejeweled lol...
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It's okay I guess but it has slow and bad connection and stuff like that ehhh I think it will do though
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting Forever for Candy Crush to be available on the kindle app store, Candy Crush is one of my favorite games to play on my kindle and laptop and cell phone haha and it's super fun and addictive so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app/game! :)
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is awesome! It's like Facebook except it's age appropriate! I would say get this because you can follow people, you can make picture put of the ones you already have, you can download free things without any trouble at all, and you can like photos and share them with other people! It's that simple! So put a finger on the download button!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Hours of fun...but can get expensive if you're not keeping track how fast that 99&cent; adds up while you're having fun.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|I have given this book a 5 star rating because of it's superb descriptions and details! It allows the reader to understand and sympathise everything that is going on around Ishmael (The main character). I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to read a book that entails a young boy who must survive a raging war with no one but his friends!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I will be using this daily for work, it's perfect!  It is exactly like the one I use now but, bigger!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is literature at its finest. The Fault in our Stars is one of the most amazing stories ever written. There are many breathtaking moments throughout this book. It is both entertaining and helpful. This book gets to you, I cried several times throughout the book. Green does an outstanding job at engaging the reader in this.book. This story portrays many lessons along with a hearttouching love story. When I read the last sentence of this book I was absolutely speechless. I was completely bawling my eyes out. Incredible story. This book would be recommended to anyone.
B00ET2ODX0|5.0|Grandmaster, Ip man was a love story.  It runs like a documentary.  However, Ip says that Wing chuan has a master and a student; the master reflects what he sees in the student, sensitivity.  Ip admires the reflection of the 64 hands movement.  Ip is from a wealth family from Foshan, in the South.  He is selected to fight the grandmaster from the North.  He wins the duel, but must fight the daughter, who is not recognized by the martial art community.  Ip has a gift.  He is not a proponent of internal energy system.  However, he does know how to beat them. Interesting.<br /><br />The movie centers on the preservation of the Gong family's system.  The Monkey turning back is the ultimate secret, the surprise counter, of the family system.  Advance forward is the motto but not the secret.  The daughter must challenge to restore honor.  Ma San claims successorship of the Gong family martial art system, bagua.  Ma San collaborates with the enemy.  In the final fight Ma San advances with his canon fist, but loses to Gong Er, as the monkey turns back. Gong Er suffers from her injuries and turns to opium.  Gong Er becomes a doctor. Ip visits her and tells Gong Er that he cares for her and hopes to see her perform 64 hands, again.  He tells Gong Er that her father would want her to keep the faith.<br /><br />Ip sees and experiences the loses of war.  The movie highlights the suffering during the Japanese imperial expansion policies of the 30s and 40s. Three million starve to death.  It is a sad and remorseful time.  A time when world powers believed in their supremacy and their domain.  The manchurian conflict highlight the Chinese resistance to a foreign power.<br /><br />The film seems like a documentary but it is not historically accurate and most of the scenes are exaggerated from the historical events to increase the entertainment aspects.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is an amazing app saved me so much time along with so much free space on my device...easy to use and works great...love it
B009HNDSL4|5.0|I have an alternative medicine practice, and I've decided Modern Family is the best tool for staying healthy! Guaranteed laughter in every episode.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Did not think I would enjoy this game as much as I have... Very entertaining, but watch the clock as you will lose track of time :-)
B007DIQC90|5.0|Just got back from Iceland where they're very proud of \\"Of Monsters and Men.\\" (If you've never been to Iceland--go!). This music never feels tiring--always Fresh and just different enough to keep me on my toes. I get transported back to the black beaches, icebergs, and waterfalls. But even if you've never been to Iceland, this music enthralls.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Not sure why the critics were so tepid on this film. It's good. Law and Mara give terrific performances. Mara continues to surprise. The plot is a who-dun-what-exactly and will keep you guessing 'til the last five minutes. I found it really entertaining.
