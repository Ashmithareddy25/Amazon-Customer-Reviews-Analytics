B003AKEGRK|5.0|Unique movie, definitely worth watching.  Suspenseful with many twists, overall excellently done. Enjoyed the action and cinematography, also the twisted plot.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Hello, Dexter Morgan.<br />Trinity Killer...best villian ever! Hungry Man episode is my favorite episode of the<br />season. Finale will have your jaw on the floor!

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME I WILL GET SO INVOLVED IN IT I WILL STAY PLAYING AFTER HOURS. GUESS WHAT I SURE YOU WILL LIKE IT. IT IS A LOT FUN.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|The Compound Effect is such an amazing book. Darren Hardy writes as if he were talking directly to you. He explains his thoughts very plainly. He really knows how to light a fire under you. This book has changed how I see my world and goals.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|love this movie.  way ahead of its time.  special effects are out of this world.  i never get tired of this movie.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|awesome game play it for hours like the different weapons and armor and all the different adventures that you have to go through
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Love that at the end of every show there's always a lesson learned about the family that most families who are as \\"modern\\" as this one can relate.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|Remember Unglorious Basterds when a WWII group went to Europe to do nothing but kill Nazis but, upon arriving, did nothing BUT TALK throughout the entire moveie?  The Drive is like that only, in this case, Gosling & Mulligan did nothing but smile at each other for half the movie with an inappropriate soundtrack in the background.  What a waste.  We had more driving action as teenagers cruising the main drag of Howard Street & 1st Avenue on weekends.
B008G12ERC|5.0|My son loves this red desk phone! He is 7 years old and wanted a red phone for his birthday. This phone is very simple and nostalgic
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Bought this book and couldn't put it down until I was done with it. I feel as if ill need to read it again in the not-to-distant future.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I'm addicted to this game! It's simple amazing...The upgrade system, the game itself.<br /><br />I'll recommend to any of my friends.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Wretched And Divine...The Story Of The Wild Ones by Black Veil Brides...I am giving this album two horns up...great energy and well played...Great live band :)
B005HE5J7I|5.0|This is the third time I have read it and I still love it.  Probably will read it again, too.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good character development and story line; plot established early and it's entertaining to watch it play out; consistency from episode to episode, making you want to come back for more.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|If you have dogs, you must read this book, but grab a box of Kleenex. We  can all learn from our dogs.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Love the old episodes.....reminds me of my youth!<br />Quality of picture ands sound is great!<br />New movies are good but the old series is the best.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Loses one minute each day. Otherwise a good watch. Seems to be durable. I would buy only knowing the mechanism is not what you would from a watch with a Seiko name on it
B00992CF6W|5.0|cant wait for the new update. it was submitted today but it has to pass through all the andriod specifications. All in all its still a great game.
0596805888|5.0|bought this for my son as a gift, and he loved it.  one of the most comprehensive books I've seen
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Amazing mouse, I was skeptical at first because of the price tag, but I was glad I bought it.<br /><br />The tracking is smooth, customizations are great (including a weight system), the only issues with the customization for me was the 4 dots representing DPI on the side, which stayed blue and the three thumb buttons only set to keyboard options (not their own separate buttons, such as &#34;Mouse 3 key&#34;). The mouse is fairly big, great for palm grip, and decent for claw grip. Clicks are sound and accurate, but the three buttons on the thumb can easily be pressable by accident.<br /><br />The mouse wheel is fairly accurate but requires a decent amount of effort to press, which can cause problems if you need to quickly press it often.<br /><br />I've had to ask for a replacement mouse due to the first one having tracking issues, but customer support was very kind and quick, even offering to ship a replacement asap with short summary of the problem.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely happy with this mouse, and will be using it for a long time to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have to say this is one of the best games I have played yet. It is very suspenseful and action packed. Perfect for all ages!! I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Thanks for listening!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true American hero who was not bound by politics, but rather by duty, honor and courage for our country. He was a true warrior and one of a kind who comes along very infrequently. Keen insight into what it takes to be a Seal and the closeness of the members of a team, for they are the only ones who can count on each other when the chips are down.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|A VERY FUN AND CHALLENGING GAME. A plus well done. Definitely a great game to pass the time with. I love the hack and slash aspects of the game.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Okay, so to preface this review, I should mention that I started watching this movie, knowing that it had gotten mixed reviews on this site. Therefore, I was not expecting to be blown away by performances or bored out of my mind while watching it. Neither of those things happened for me. Granted, the first 20 minutes or so were a bit slow-paced for me, but after that, the pace was fine for me. It would definitely be a mistake for anyone to get this movie, expecting it to be kid-friendly. Like some people have mentioned in their reviews, the fact that Kristen Stewart (Snow White) always had the same expression on her face throughout the entire movie was probably the one minor setback in terms of acting. Charlize Theron (The Evil Queen) was without a doubt captivating as the villainous character of the film. I truly did find myself despising her character the whole time. That does not happen too often for me when I'm watching a movie unless the actor is so good at portraying the character. Chris Hemsworth (The Huntsman) did a pretty decent job in his role as the protector of Snow White. I'd have to say that metaphorically-speaking, I walked away from this movie awestruck--in a good way. It's not easy to say who I would recommend this film to. People who don't like Kristen Stewart will likely avoid seeing it. I suppose if you are a fan of action-packed, dark drama-type movies, this movie will appeal to you. All in all, I liked it and will likely watch it again someday.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I get emails faster. Less problems. And when it's empty it's got cute sayings. I recomend this email app for all kindle users.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised with this book. Kept me gripped the whole time. This was a book club pick for the month and everyone loved it.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Great ending to an epic saga. Some of the loose ends were rid off quickly, which was strange due to the build up on earlier books. Although, it was OK, since one tends to forget some of the character after reading this books for years, and at the end with years in between :)
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love it! looking forward to her next release! I hope it soon. very talinted young lady, saw her at Upstate Music Hall
B000W453KQ|5.0|I have loved this movie since it originally came out many years ago. It is about love between 2 totally different people and how they tried to make it work. I won't give out any more for those who haven't seen it, but I recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let's start with the obvious: this is YA, so don't expect Nabokov. It's being written for an audience that's discovering how books can reflect the ugliness and difficulty of living in the world around you - a rare admission when most books for the middle or high school set take timid steps towards adulthood.<br /><br />I think the reason why these books have taken off is because they reflect a seriousness and harsh acknowledgement that the life is unfair, that actions have irreparable consequences - and some kids are hungry for those truths.<br /><br />That's not to say it's at all a grim slog. It's brilliant and breezy dystopian sci-fi, and will remind you of the pleasures of being transported for the first time by Bradbury, or Huxley, and discovering the pleasures of adult reading.
B009C7JS14|4.0|I love this app because then I can know what the weather is going to be like.I love this  app because I know what kinds of clothes to wear.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A great book for to motivate people to look forward and continuously listen themselves in order to achieve their goals.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|this is a good movie, good actors, good fx, good budget movie,  kind of zombiland, american style and little bit of Shaun of the Dead but no too much blood, comedy, funny, good music, good idea, good end, good for the family, buy it rent it and make copy and keep it..grab your popcorn and enjoy
B0089LOG02|5.0|I truly enjoy fiction based upon historical fact.  This appears to be an excellent example of that type.  The characters were well written and likeable for the most part.  Sorry to come to the end of the book.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|This book is a breezy read by the standards of such insider books while not being sinister in intentions or prose.<br />Author puts his heart out on every topic he deemed fit to be included - dealing with food suppliers, kitchen utensils, japanese fish market, another chef who does everything opposite to what author does and is still successful.<br />Read it as if you are listening to an extempore speech with loosely defined topic and you will like it. One or two life lessons might also folow you if you keep the big picture in mind.<br />I, for one, got that the author like all others, who are passionate about something, feels a higher calling to cook and man the madhouses he calls his kitchen. The paths may differ but they all live their passion.
B005H9B44A|1.0|Do not waste your time with this one unless youu are a sci fi nut. no good unless you have nothing to do.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|My daughter and I loved this movie. Fresh actors and great story. Will definitely read the book now. Very entertaining.
B000B8QF00|5.0|This truly was a greatest hits collection, though there were some that weren't here, like &#34;Unsent&#34; but all in all, still pretty good
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By far the best series I have ever read.  a little bit of everything.  very descriptive.  very suspenseful.  great collection. recommended
B007Y36K46|5.0|Great story,characters,acting,romance,special effects,action,etc.  A movie like this is meant to provide an escape and let you dream.  If the movie is good, it lets you escape, experience and believe in a fantasy.  This movie does a wonderful job in this regard.  It was very easy to escape into and want to believe.  The growing romance between the princess and John is especially well done.  Maybe it is because I read the books as a kid or maybe because I love sci-fi, but I really loved this movie.  What more could you ask for?  I'm curious why it didn't get better press or reviews when it was released.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|fantastic and wonderful show. I enjoyed it a lot. Great if you love a mix of drama and mystery combined.
B004NOH9LW|3.0|It seemed a tad too tongue-in-cheek. I was confused with the mixture of transitions between scenes. I was expecting more from a Matt Damon flick. I don't think I'll ever watch another movie directed by Eastwood.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Finished the book in one afternoon....that good! One of my all time favorite series. Thanks Charlaine, you really write a super read!
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This book starts a little slow. You wonder &#34;what is this going to be about? How can a book about a 100 year-old man be interesting?&#34;  It is, because it flashes back to the many interesting/fun/provocative events throughout his life, that all seem to tie together in the end, along the lines of Forrest Gump.<br /> It is well written and great fun.
B007I1QUHG|2.0|I ordered the product from the U.S. and I was sent dvd's that are for region 2, not region 1.  It was ordered as a birthday gift for my grandson and has been basically unusable.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Enjoyable vacation read. Not too heavy or morbid, yet plenty of twists & turns to stay interesting. Got a little confused with the genealogy toward the end, but think that's part of the plot.  No regrets.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I liked the mixture of all different genres in this movie. I wasn't too thrilled about some of the makeup.<br />Pretty good; over all.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I enjoy the mini challenges and am addicted to getting them accomplished. I like that you can move things around so you can have the look you want even after adding other things.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Who knew that Zombies were actually articulate, well, as first person narrators anyway.<br />Fun for the whole family especially if the whole family is comprised of chicks.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This movie has much of historical interest, and Daniel Day Lewis' performance is extraordinary. However, I felt it could have been shortened by at least a half hour.  With less detail the movie could still have made an impact.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Saw it in the theater and again on Amazon with my daughter who has a bi-polar daughter.  I found it to be a poignant reminder of the challenges our family may face in the years to come.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! I'm a very visual person and have had a scrapbook of magazine tear outs for a long time. Pinterest allows me to do this on a much broader scale, for much less time and space. I can't imagine not having Pinterest now. Lol.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have read all the books by this author and this show is great so riveting I did a marathon and watched them all in one day..
B005S9EKCW|5.0|the eternal book of the great French author victor hugo comes to life in this magnificent and vivid version of les miserable. I enjoyed it very much and I strongly recommend it to any true movie lover.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|The video quality and effects from this movie was amazing.  This was probably one the greatest CG films created.  The story isn't too hard to follow, even for those who aren't Halo fans.  This was a great buy and the acting was excellent.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I watched this movie with my grandchildren and saw it through their eyes it was a good movie filled with excitement.  Basically, it;s good against evil with good triumphing.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Don't be put off by the hokey sets and costumes, the dreadful special effects, the overdramatic music, and the dated &#34;future technology&#34; - this series is still a gem. It's a product of its time, and yet, it transcends its time to still be fun and meaningful today. It's the character dynamics that make it worth watching. I'm 23, and I absolutely love seeing the three main characters - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy - interact. The dialog is consistently good, and the stories are interesting and usually quite thought-provoking, if not deep. And while, as mentioned, the technology is &#34;dated&#34; (they're still using tapes, for example), it's still marvelous to see such inventive perceptions of future innovations. After all, Star Trek is where the sci-fi genre began.<br /><br />It's really enjoyable to see the crew of the Enterprise get themselves into and out of countless no-win situations through the ingenuity of Kirk and Spock, outwitting aliens and teaching them not to underestimate humanity. For a 60's TV show, there is a remarkable amount of character depth and growth in the leads, though Mr. Spock's may be the most obvious. Nimoy's stoic Spock - Captain Kirk's first officer and true right-hand man (er, Vulcan) - adds needed balance to Shatner's rather melodramatic Kirk while the folksy McCoy's playful conflicts with Spock are, perhaps, the heart of the show.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series for any sci-fi fan, obviously, and also, for anyone willing to look past a bit of 60's cheesiness and experience an epic adventure with the show's endlessly endearing characters. Live long and prosper.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I loved this bit of history true to its time...cant beat the history channel. You  will love it if you like this time period
B001W63DY6|5.0|as always the best singer the American culture produced. great vocal skills and songs that remind you of past better times and gives you hope for better times ahead
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|The sounds were just what I expected from the movie.  Excellent quality and very good compositions.  The soundtrack has now become one of my favorites.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|With this fantastic cast and amazing cinematography and unique plot, I was expecting a far better movie.  When I was finished watching \\"Cloud Atlas\\" I felt like I may have wasted 3 hours of my life that I will never get back.  I gave it 3 stars because of the actors and the \\"look\\" of the movie.  The whole reincarnation/multiple-lives theme bored me.  I am sure that some well find this movie breathtaking and eye-opening, but I am not one of them.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is a beautiful story. Well paced, brilliantly performed. Tension in all the right places. I want more films like this.
B006JP11HQ|2.0|I am a fiscal Conservative and this proves that you can't judge a book by its title. I did not know anything about Milton Friedman before reading this book. After miring through for a while, I just realized this book was not what I was expecting.<br /><br />I understand Liberalism and respect its concepts and precepts and I understand Conservatism and understand and respect it's concepts and precepts as well. I was just thinking I was getting a book on Conservative thought and not on Liberal thought as it pertained to capitalism. And it is not that I have not read things like &#34;My Life&#34; by Bill Clinton or the Role of a Lifetime by Lou Cannon. I am fair and open minded guy.<br /><br />Sometimes our expectations given the timing, are inversely proportional to our enjoyment of things such as was the case for me with this book.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I recognize that this book is a classic. It argues a lot of the same points that get argued today....against capitalism and how it impedes our freedom as opposed to how it promotes it. Friedman is an advocate of more government oversight, and with that I personally disagree, which is why for me I gave it two stars.<br /><br />Looking at it from the Liberal viewpoint, I could see it being a 4-5 star book because quite frankly it stands up very well to today's way that Liberals vs Conservatives think.  And if you are a Liberal or someone who is middle of the road or Conservative looking to either have your mind opened or see the opposing view, this book is certainly worth considering reading.
B00AAQ7JNA|5.0|great singer great performance that left me speechless I just loves every moment of it and I warmly recommend it
1439156816|5.0|I really enjoyed this.<br />Not just a book on writing, King tells several stories about his life, incidents which shaped him into the person and writer that he is. The kid had a rough childhood. Always great to see people who've suffered grow up to achieve greatness.<br />The thing I liked most about this book was the love for his wife, clearly evident. Who would have thought Stephen King was such a sweetheart? With all the messed up stuff he writes it is easy to assume he'd have a grossly dysfunctional family and horrible relationships, but each mention of his wife was so sweet and full of respect. Stephen King may write about a lot of monsters but he is one of the good guys.<br />As for the writing stuff - this is , after all, a memoir of the craft - he delivered it in a casual, easygoing way. No stuffy English lessons here. I'd label this as more of an autobiography than a book on writing, but there were definitely some good tips sprinkled liberally throughout and in a way that was far more entertaining than your run of the mill book on writing.
B00A72989U|4.0|Alicia Keys is one of my favorite artists.  As such, it necessitated purchasing the album in order to keep my collection up-to-date.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I think that Cut the Rope: Time Travel is the most exiting version of Cut the Rope ever in the history of Cut the Rope, Thanks.
B003VW54QO|5.0|A bad, bad guy.  A great good guy.  A pretty girl.  Music, the songs Dean & Ricky sing; the haunting &#34;Cutthroat's song&#34; and the opening/closing theme.  Just everything you want in a Western.  I've seen it dozens, if not hundreds of times.  I watched it again the other night to cleanse my mind after &#34;Once Upon A Time In the West&#34;.<br /><br />It's not Wayne's best, that would be &#34;The Searchers&#34;.  But really awesome in it's own right.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|as always a well made james bond movie packed with magnificent action and wonderful actors. I recommend it with all of my heart.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love the so detailed pictures and is very similar to the TV show. When you get the chance you need to read this book. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0021QJRX2|4.0|I have been aware of Lisa Stansfield's work from the other rendition of her track \\"All Around the World.\\"  However, this is the first time I have taken the time to listen to one of her albums.  The only way that I can properly compliment the album is to agree with the conventional wisdom that \\"good music is good music\\" (first heard from the artist Shyne).  I look forward to listen to her other releases.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I just finished the audio version of this book and it was awesome. The book contains four main characters Laurel, Dorothy, Vivian, and Jimmy. This is the type of book that those who love literature wish they could write... rich characters, a wonderful story line that goes back and forth through different periods of time effortlessly, and it is such an awesome tale.  Sigh ... I have not enjoyed a story like this one in awhile. This was the first book I had tried by this author and I am looking forward to reading more.
B000HZM4FW|4.0|I don't know if it's a classic, but it was ok.  Strange ending.  Faye Dunaway's lack of eyebrows was very distracting.  I'm sure I missed dialogue.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|wonderful gangster movie packed with good old action and lots of great actors that contribute to its magnificent success, and that is great.
0380713802|5.0|All of Bill Bryson's books are great and super funny.  Highly recommended to anyone who wants to belly laugh.  And he writes about places that are real.  I hope he writes more books, I own many of his.  Worth reading if you enjoy laughter in a book.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I am so glad that this is the amazon free app of the day. This game is very fun. :) I will be entertained for hours.
B005QVCXM6|5.0|all songs are well done. i only feel that &#34;swimming home&#34; was a kind of piece together voice range practice lesson.
B0055IU4GM|1.0|all the songs sound the same. I put the cd in the trash, didn't want it taking up space.I will try another John Hiatt tho.
B00BEYYEE4|5.0|I liked the movie very much. it was quite interesting and thrilling. I recommend it with all of my heart.
B00770KR7W|5.0|This is Master Chief from Halo 4 and he is pretty cool! I don't necessarily like the feel of the new figures as much as the Reach ones, the plastic does feel different but I guess I'll get used to it. He is pretty generic, no cool weapons or accessories. They'll probably come out with at least 20 different versions of him by the time Halo 5 comes out. He does have a weapon peg so that's good.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This product is great. No complaints. I had bought two from Wal-Mart, but they wouldn't work very well with the kindle fire hd. This product charges at anytime, even when I'm watching a movie.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is so cute!  I cant stop playing this game.  My parents also love this game because of how it helps you get smarter.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|This was a pretty good movie, but it sucked at the same time. It did not follow the book at all, it changed the age of the characters (which is quite vital in this series), it changed almost all of the important and even the unimportant events that take place in the book, and it even changed some of the appearances (Annabeth is a brunette in this movie). It didn't contain too much of the innocent and wry humor of Rick Riordan that we all know and love. Sure, it contained humor, and it was in fact funny, but it didn't feel right, it almost felt forced. The action was also a bit bogus, like it was from the 1980's (no offense to those movies). My advice, stick with the books. This goes to the producers of the movie and to the movie viewers.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Not only does it help with formatting the three vovels I'm writing, it gives good tips for my writing its self. A must for anyone planning to submit books on Amazon. The guide is very informative. Not only that, it's very easy to understand and follow in step by step instructions. This is a must for the beginner auther into the world of literature. J. W. in SC.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I only write reviews about books that really move me and this book done just that! It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me feel sad, it made me feel happy, but most of all it made me question how I feel about certain things in life. It made me think deeper about how I feel about life in general. It's very calming and you'll fall in love with the main character, Charlie. I feel sad because I'll probably never find a really great book like this that was so beautifully written like this again.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Shazam is most amazing app!  Answers so many puzzling questions of artists and songs!<br />It's wonderful!  Telling me my friends & they're amazed I know about it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun!  If you are wondering about the price, it is totally worth it.  The only reason some people don't like it it's because they don't understand the game.  There are so much things to do in minecraft and you can never win or lose so you can play forever! My whole family LOVES this game.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love my kindle..it goes everywhere i go..use it with my wifi device, so perfect for travel, bought the HD version as well
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I enjoyed reading this story. The last several novels I've read had horrible endings, not this one. The writing was okay and at times a little predictable but the perspective on the legal system and DNA was interesting. I would recommend this book to friends looking for a quick summer read.
0060594896|5.0|This book is full of fantastic suggestions for achieving success in all areas of our lives.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  As all of us need to keep learning and growing, this book is a must have for anyone's personal library.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry birds does it again!<br />I enjoy angry birds, and so do my grandchildren!!<br />This is a very addictive game.<br />I would recommend.
B006R1T40I|5.0|What can you say that hasn't already be said about Bonnie Raitt.  If you are a Bonnie Raitt fan, you got to have this CD. It is just a shame that it took seven years between CD's.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|5 stars for a master author, i recomend this publication to reading friends and to friends in our local library book club
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a very entertaining game. I like it so much better than Jewel Quest. Looking forward to the next level.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved it it was really good and it sucked me in right away and I thought that I wouldn't like it but I really did.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is very addicting.  Someone else said it's like the pc game Mist and it really is. So much fun and worth the money
B009KS4XRO|3.0|good game but didn't like not being able to play with my facebook friends on the Kindle Fire so returned Kindle Fire and am back to playing this game with my facebook friends
B009XY5G80|5.0|5 star rating for the twists in the story, the major twist was not expected, one (whish i am) needs to be a Virginia Woolf fan to enjoy the prose.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I  haven't really tried playing with other friends as yet. I am in the process of trying to get three stars in the practice part of the game.  It should be fun when I start playing with opponents.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Pretty good could be better over all pritty good app there should be power upps and make some there should be more ofter updates
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A fun read,  great to be able to visualize the characters based on the TV show. Worth reading, can't wait to start the next Heat book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was well written and spellbinding. I would recommend it to all as a  must read. It is inspirational.
B007HUD6OS|2.0|This series of books is getting repetitive. While I enjoyed the other books this one did not live up to my expectations of  John Grisham. I'm not sure if I would buy another one in this series.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|It is great fun and challenging.  I have mastered the first part and am in the process of getting all three stars in the second. I have two more to get.  Right now I three stars in most.  I could play it all day.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|I'm not exactly sure why this isn't available as an MP3 download, but it was in keeping with the whole retro feel that I had to suffer through two whole days of anticipation until I had it in my hands.  After the wait, I wasn't disappointed.  I was prepared for the fact that it wasn't going to feel as ground-breaking as \\"Deleted Scenes...\\", because it can't feel brand-new and exciting twice.  Having said that, this CD is just as addictive, as fun, and as listenable as the first.  I plan on playing this quite a bit in the car (I have a 45-minute commute so this is perfect) so that I can in fact immerse myself in it.  I'm also exactly old enough that the era that is the backdrop here is the that of the glamorous adults, so I'm enjoying that aspect, as well.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I chose this rating because: It wasn't a &#34;seasonal&#34; style, there's no fb competition, and it was FREE! The colors are great on my Kindle Fire! There are MANY levels and MANY styles of more game choices! The game keeps your records, so I can play game #1 on.... The game keeps a record of time but I ignore this and play at my own pace! I would recommend this product to anyone for relaxing fun!!

1451624468|4.0|Krauss is a brilliant guy with a lively style but this book, despite offering the general reader some real insight into contemporary cosmology, and some rye jokes, was a bit of a disappointment to me. The main problem I think is that Krauss doesn't come to grips with the implied question in the subtitle, \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\"<br /><br />First he wants us to know that \\"why\\" questions are really not science, they're philosophy. The question our esteemed author insists on is \\"HOW is there something rather than nothing?\\" But this is not the same question.<br /><br />Next there is the sleight of hand with the notion of \\"nothing.\\" Putting aside word play such as the ambiguity in, say, \\"nothing matters,\\" it is not correct to say that the universe came from nothing because it came from the expansion of space. Space is not nothing, as Krauss admits on page 152. The question then would be why does all this space exist? The answer, it came from inflation. But inflation required energy and that also is not nothing.<br /><br />So all of Krauss's talk (from the also brilliant Alan Guth, by the way) about the universe being the ultimate free lunch is just that, talk. The plain truth of the matter is that, yes, the question \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\" is a philosophic question and not the sort of question that physics can answer. However it is not a subterfuge for slipping God into any equation (as Krauss implies), although I suppose some people do that. It is instead a profound question that has been asked, as Krauss points out, since antiquity with still no answer in sight. If we could get an answer as Hawking said, we would know the mind of God.<br /><br />Krauss gives physicist Frank Wilczek's answer which is that \\"nothing is unstable.\\" Somehow I didn't get the proof for that except to understand that virtual particles go in and out of existence in \\"empty\\" space according to quantum mechanics, which I don't doubt. However again it is the case that that empty space is just not empty so there was never any instability between nothing and something because there never was any nothing. The problem as I see it is the limits of our science. There is something about space that we just don't understand. We know from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that space cannot be empty, but we don't know why--or, as Krauss would have it, we don't know how space could be empty.<br /><br />I could give you the answer, \\"nothing is impossible,\\" which after reading this book, seems more and more likely, yet there is no way I or anyone else can or has demonstrated that nothing is an impossible state of the universe. Yet it could be true.<br /><br />It is rather annoying (I imagine that Einstein, James Clerk Maxwell, Niels Bohr, et al. are twirling in their graves) to see physicists today doing either math or philosophy and imagining that they are doing physics. I will give Krauss credit though. He gently makes it clear that string theory, for example, is not science. (See pages 130-134)<br /><br />As far as the cosmology and physics in the book go, I think Krauss makes some things that were previously opaque somewhat clear. Take for example why inflation occurred. It seems (as Guth realized) that \\"as the universe cooled, it underwent some kind of phase transition--as occurs, for example when water freezes to ice...\\" (p. 96) This led to the release of energy as \\"latent heat\\" leading to the incredible inflation that expanded the universe by a factor of more than ten to the twenty-eighth. Now THAT is an expansion.<br /><br />I also liked the suggestion that the Big Bang may have spawned multiple universes. However those other universes apparently are not in any practical sense part of our universe because inflation pushed them so fast and furiously away from us that their light will never reach us. These I believe are different than those that some physicists believe came into existence outside the Big Bang. (pp. 128-129)<br /><br />One thing I didn't understand is this: Krauss says that the universe is currently flat; however in the future it will be open, so ultimately the universe is NOT flat. Have I got that right?<br /><br />Another thing I didn't get is this: Krauss tells us that during some time in the past before the dark energy of space exceeded the gravitational pull of matter and radiation that the expansion of the universe was slowing down. Does he mean that space was contracting or just the matter and radiation? If space itself was contracting then we have a mind's eye picture of a shrinking ball of space with matter and radiation within getting closer together. If only matter and radiation were contracting while presumably space was expanding or staying the same, we have a picture of the bubble of the universe with lots of space along its boundaries (if we can speak of boundaries of space) while nearer the center are matter and radiation. Which is it? I don't know.<br /><br />Puzzling was Krauss's insistence that we live in a \\"special\\" time because the contractive pull of matter and radiation exactly matches the expansionary force of dark energy. (pp. 122-123) I think it is only special to us (or actually only to cosmologists) and moreover this special time probably spans millions of years.<br /><br />Okay, now for some Kraussian jokes.<br /><br />First a string theory joke. He writes, \\"...the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Frank Wilczek has suggested that string theorists have invented a new way of doing physics, reminiscent of a novel way of playing darts. First, one throws the dart against a blank wall, and then one goes to the wall and draws a bull's-eye around where the dart landed.\\" (p. 134)<br /><br />Here's a bit about particle physicists and the anthropic principle (sort of): \\"Cosmology has produced one totally mysterious quantity: the energy of empty space, about which we understand virtually nothing. However, particle physics has not understood many more quantities for far longer!\\" He adds further down the page, \\"Maybe all of the mysteries of particle theory can be solved by invoking the same mantra: if the universe were any other way, we could not live in it.\\" (p. 136)<br /><br />On the last jocular point I would say, maybe not us but some other creatures, and they would be invoking the same anthropomorphic principle and calling it by another name.<br /><br />Krauss remarks that \\"one way to see a supernova is simply to assign a different graduate student to each galaxy in the sky. After all, one hundred years is not too different, in a cosmic sense at least, from the average time to do a PhD, and graduate students are cheap and abundant.\\" (p. 20)<br /><br />Actually the best joke in the book is also a double pun on the phrase \\"universally attractive\\": \\"Any high school student will happily tell you that gravity sucks--that is, it is universally attractive.\\" (p. 77) (No, I will not explain this.)<br /><br />Another question about the nature of the state of nothing is, could there be nothing but the laws of nature existing in truly empty space and time? Or put another way (and I wonder if this is ~ Krauss's position) there is something rather than nothing because the laws of nature will always be there whether there is space and matter or not.<br /><br />Near the end of the book Krauss does explicitly address the essentially philosophic nature of the question at hand. Brushing aside the need for a First Cause, he writes: \\"...empty space or the more fundamental nothingness from which empty space may have arisen, preexisted, and is eternal.\\" (p.174)<br /><br />Best and easiest answer I think.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"The World Is Not as We Think It Is\\"br /><br />One thing I didn't understand is this: Krauss says that the universe is currently flat; however in the future it will be open, so ultimately the universe is NOT flat.

B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|While you could hardly call this album original, you'll hear beats and audio tricks that will immediately remind you of current and recent pop giants, for a contemporary pop album, this is still a great album. It is the first album she's put out that I can listen to beginning to end without any duds. While I still think her voice shines best with more rock flavored tracks, this album has a clear, consistent modern pop style (contrast that to Skyscraper that was littered with R&B wannabe duds) that has made itself an album length earworm for me.

B000VSYDRM|1.0|I decided to watch this movie based on the description, the actors, and the decent reviews.  I am reviewing this movie because I found it to be a complete disappointment.  I came to this movie with the knowledge of it being based on a well-received book, but I have not read it.  My opinion is based solely on the movie.<br /><br />The movie was beautifully made.  The setting, the people, the costumes.  I found that all to be believable and it pulled me into the movie.  Initially there were parts I liked and parts I had to suspend belief a bit to watch, but I do not have a problem with that.  If I like a movie, I like it.  It doesn't matter if it got poor reviews or if I understand why others don't like it.  So I kept watching.  Warning:  Spoilers to follow.  Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens.<br /><br />Here are some of the problems I had with the movie.  Each on their own I may have been able to look past, or even a couple, but when put together, it was just too much.  A man can smell a perfume and recreate it IN SECONDS, grabbing CLOSED BOTTLES of essences from around a large room without pause, even though these bottles are clustered with countless others.  He pours these essences in the proper quantities and shakes them together, voila, identical perfumes.  This same man thinks he can preserve the odor of a cat by basically boiling the cat.  Having seen blood and death, it never occurs to him that the scent will change from the living cat to the dead, cooked cat.  The man, trying to follow a woman who smells good to him, figured out that she left town, and what direction she went in, simply by waking and breathing.  From what was apparently miles away.  In open countryside.  So incredible is this man that, using the scent of over a dozen women (now dead), he was able to release a few drops of this incredible perfume, turning an angry mob, screaming for his death because of all the women he murdered, into a mass of people who now saw him as an angel and proceeded to have sex in a courtyard with the person nearest them, no matter how unlikely the match.  They then all went to sleep there or passed out while he escaped.<br /><br />The man journeys to the place he was born, which he found by smell, because apparently the place smelled exactly the same as it did when he formed the memory as a newborn.  He then douses himself with the rest of the fragrance, entrancing a smaller group of people (huh? really?) who are so taken by the fragrance that they CONSUME him on the spot.  Yes.  They ate him.<br /><br />I honestly expected to be mildly disappointed that this was a dream just before his death.  My disappointment was so much greater when I saw that this is supposedly what happened.  I was willing to accept everything up until he created a scent that was able to enchant people the way it did.  I can honestly say out of all the movies I have seen, plenty that I liked and a fair number I did not, this would have to be the very last movie I would recommend to anybody.<br /><br />Again, I did not read the book, and it is entirely possible I would feel differently.  If you haven't read the book and you've made it this far in my review, well, you've been warned.an angel and proceeded to have sex in a courtyard with the person nearest them, no matter how unlikely the match.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Generally we get a game and within a month its over and history-this game is very long lasting which is great when you pay for something. My favorite part is the sounds of all the dinosaurs... so cool and terrifies our cats. There is an above ground park and once you expand a certain degree an underwater park also. Awesome idea and well done- just takes a bit to get reaaaally going!
B005NACYQU|5.0|This book was a joy to read throughout. I liked the easy going nature of the main protagonist while the other characters were always interesting to say the least. I appreciated how Gaiman incorporated Gods from a number of different cultures and time periods into the story. I wouldn't be intimidated by this though as there is no need to research these characters in order to fully enjoy this story. It is very hard to pin a distinct genre on this book as it elegantly incorporates many genre threads which Gaiman controls like a master puppeteer. I would recommend this book to any adult who simply enjoys reading books with social commentary mixed in with a fantastical story.

B00BGI086Q|5.0|I collected comics for 15 years, starting back when I was in high school.  My friends and I would sit around and wonder if movies would ever be made with some of our favorite heroes.  \\"Superman\\" was pretty much it.  A few years later, \\"Batman\\" came out and started the ball rolling for darker heroes.  And now, with computer technology, the sky's the limit for comic book heroes.<br /><br />For the past ten years, there hasn't been a summer without at least one superhero movie.  A few of them have been fantastic!  Some have been good, and a number of them have been awful.<br /><br />Back in 2001, a new TV show would change the demographics for a superhero show.  \\"Smallville\\" came on.  At first, many people were sighing and saying, \\"God, not another Superman show!\\"  Only this show did something that even Nolan hadn't conceived of yet: a show grounded more in reality than in fantasy.  Creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar promised the viewers two things: no flights and no tights.<br /><br />After the success (understatement!) of the new Batman franchise, it was time that TV take on yet another dark hero.  Enter, \\"Arrow.\\"<br /><br />\\"Arrow\\" is based on the DC Comics hero, Green Arrow.  So far, two major things have prevented this show from being campy and cheesy: no silly costume, and no \\"Green Arrow\\" name.  Oh, the name was thrown out there once when members of a dinner party are trying to come up with another name for \\"The Hood\\" guy.  Someone suggests, \\"how about Green Arrow?\\" to which Oliver Queen scoffs at by saying, \\"lame!\\"<br /><br />\\"Arrow\\" is a roller-coaster ride right from the get go.  The writers took an ingenious approach.  Rather than spend a number of episodes miring the viewers down in the origins of Oliver Queen's ascension to the hero we all know and love, they instead interweave a fascinating back story that is enmeshed throughout each episode.  Also, for comic books fans, you will see a number of recognizable characters which don't take away or detract from the heart of the story.  \\"Arrow\\" never allows itself to become campy in any way.  This is very much more of an \\"adult\\" oriented show.<br /><br />Oliver Queen is stranded on an island for five years along with a book containing a list that his father gives him.  The book contains a list of names of people who have abused or misused their wealth and/or power upon the people of Starling City.  Oliver swears that if he survives the island, he will find a way to carry out this mission.<br /><br />Stephen Amell heads that cast as Oliver Queen.  He has the physique and the attitude to fill the shoes of Oliver Queen very nicely.  There is no mistake that his character takes on a number of similarities to Bruce Wayne's Batman.  He's brooding, tough, and virtually merciless toward the criminals he fights.  And yet, Amell's easily able to work Oliver's other side: the charming and boyish playboy who is just trying to get his life back after being away for five years.<br /><br />Dinah \\"Laurel\\" Lance plays a young attorney who was romantically involved with Oliver before the boating accident.  There is a reason that she is not particularly thrilled that he's alive, and comic book readers have, I'm sure, already connected the dots and realized that Dinah \\"Laurel\\" Lance is the real identity of the heroine, The Black Canary.  Katie Cassidy plays Laurel with grim charm and determination.  She and Amell have an obvious chemistry that will undoubtedly be coming into play as the story progresses.<br /><br />Personally, I believe that the best actor on the show is Paul Blackthorne, a veteran English actor who plays Detective Quentin Lance, and the father of Laurel.  Detective Lance has a real hatred for Oliver as he blames him for the death of his youngest daughter.  He also harbors no love for the vigilante who operates outside of the law, and Detective Lance wants nothing more than to catch him.  Blackthorne does a fantastic job of playing a detective on the edge, who loves hisfamily, but who is also scarred and in obvious pain from the tragic loss of his daughter.  Blackthorne does a great job of harnessing all of these emotions and allowing them to be easily read on his face during his scenes.<br /><br />Another favorite of mine is David Ramsey as John Diggle, an ex-military man serving as Oliver Queen's bodyguard and associate.  It would be very easy for Ramsey to play Diggle with a typical woodeness that would make the character boring and very two-dimensional.  Ramsey doesn't do this.  Yes, Diggle is tough and he has a certain military persona, but he's also a deeper man than this.  As the show progresses, Diggle becomes almost a mental and moral mentor for Queen.<br /><br />All-in-all, the cast is great, from top to bottom.  The action sequences are masterfully displayed.  The show has a grittiness that no other superhero show has ever had.  We see martial arts prowess put on full display.  (Green Arrow, in the comics, is one of the best martial artists in the DC world).  Bones are broken, necks are snapped, and if need-be, Oliver has no qualms about permanently taking out those who are trying to kill him or others.<br /><br />I have to say that I like the costume idea.  It's practical and it doesn't take on any kind of silly or radical ideas.  Oliver is able to move easily and yet disguise his face with the hood and some simply face-paint.  As cool as Hartley's costume was from \\"Smallville,\\" this one makes that costume look cartoonish by comparison.  They did take the \\"voice disguising\\" idea from Smallville, however, and it works well.<br /><br />\\"Arrow\\" is a fantastic show, and I feel, one of the best of the 2012-2013 season.  The writing is crisp and so is the dialogue.  There is much going on in Oliver's new world and Starling City, and it's a thrill ride to see how Oliver is going to be able to deal with it all.<br /><br />Season One is fantastic without any \\"bad\\" or \\"slow\\" episodes in the bunch, in my opinion, and I am really enjoying Oliver's current adventures while at the same time enjoying how he comes to be the master marksman with the backdrop stories of his time on the island.

B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|After hearing \\"Heart Attack\\" on the radio, I knew I had to get this album when it came out. I got it yesterday and have been listening to it a probably unhealthy amount of time. It  is AMAZING start to finish. Not a single weak track to be found!!!<br />On this album, there are slower, more emotional songs like \\"Warrior\\" and \\"Nightingale\\", and there are happier, pop songs, like \\"Really Don't Care\\" and \\"Heart Attack\\".<br />In my opinion, the best are:<br />5. Shouldn't Come Back<br />4. Something That We're Not<br />3. Warrior<br />2. Really Don't Care (feat. Cher Llyod)<br />1. Nightingale<br />All in all, this is a very strong album, and probably one of my favorites, ever.<br />UPDATE 1 (5/30/13)<br />This album is still one of my favorites and I can't stop listening! However, I have come to dislike \\"Neon Lights\\", it just didn't sound as great as it did the first listen. It just got boring.<br />Best Songs in Order:<br />13. Neon Lights 4/10(the only boring and not good song)<br />12. Two Pieces 7/10 (not bad, it's just a little to long and repetitive)<br />11. In Case 8/10<br />10. Without the Love 8/10 (eh...)<br />9. Never Been Hurt 8/10<br />8. Heart Attack 9/10<br />7. Warrior 9.5/10<br />6. Fire Starter 9.5/10<br />5. Shouldn't Come Back 10/10<br />4. Made in the USA 10/10<br />3. Something That We're Not 10/10<br />2. Nightingale 10/10<br />1. Really Don't Care 10/10 (AWESOME!)
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was a fast read, a good second book keeping you on the edge of your seat and ready for the next book.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I do not recall what I was watching with the kids when we heard some Bee Gees music. It really brought back memories when I was in school ( over 30 years ago). I found this CD set. It has all of their greatest songs. It even has some flops that I did not remember. Again, it really is the Ultimate Bee Gees Collection. If you like the Bee Gees, you will love this 2 CD set.
0765325950|1.0|While reading the book, I noticed a huge part of the binding had come undone.  Very sad, as this was part of my collection.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've only just started this game. So far it's been great. Relaxing, not too taxing or frustrating. Something to do while the adverts are on or as a time-filler without being too consuming. Addictive and relaxing...so far!
B001EC3JME|3.0|it's fine but a little too loose for the mini mag lite.  as long as you don't articulate it to be straight down, it works great.
B00509898G|1.0|Gratuitous senseless violence - hard to find merit in this sad tale - could not really get into this story and find it hard to see why it seems to be so popular
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I haven't finished this yet but am close. It is a good book especially if you are an Apple and Jobs fan.  You will certainly learn a lot of interesting facts about Apple and Jobs that you didn't know.  However, I wouldn't say this is a very entertaining or fun book to read.  It gets pretty dry and boring about half way through unfortunately.  I never knew that Jobs liked to take walks with people to discuss things and solve problems.  But gosh, the book probably mentions his walks more than a dozen times!  I kinda will be glad when I finish this one which is unfortunate because I am a big Apple and Jobs fan.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome.  There is a purchase option, but the game is so fun and additive you won't need to purchase anything. You just keep playing.  I can't wait for the next game to come out!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|So true in real life.  Can't escape a crazy person no matter how hard you try.  The crazy thing is you don't see it coming till to late.  They portray life as it really happens.  Even as a police officer you can be crazy.
1432794426|5.0|This book is entertaining, surprising, and extremely moving. If you loved Michael, you should read this book; if you didn't love him you NEED to read this book. It not only explains how Michael was victimized, but suggests possible reasons WHY.<br />It is unfortunate that the American media and its consumers prefer freaks and villains to genuinely guileless, loving and generous heroes like Michael Jackson. Can you say \\"intellectual devolution\\"?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic 3D graphics. Play-ability challenging, yet puzzling enough to keep you reaching for more clues in order to get the objects necessary in order to advance to the next phase with more pieces of the puzzle until a chapter is completed. Even without a cheat sheet or walk through chart, this game is possible to complete. The Room will give you a taste but leave you hungry for future editions. I am craving More Rooms and I will be purchasing more if this game is offered for the Kindle tablet. You won't be disappointed if you like brain teasers. Buy it. This game may be short but still considered a Great Value!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|No skips, no audio problems. Plays great in my Sony Blue-Ray Player.<br /><br />Classic movie. Fun to watch all the actors in their young days :)
B005IEGUDY|4.0|We are traveling to Salisbury in the near future and someone recommended I read Sarum.  The book provides lots of historical info along with an interesting story.  It is a very long book and the story is quite predictable.  I liked the book, but didn't love it.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|Was everything I had hoped he would be. He was always a mix of the stupid, selfish, rash, and the bold, brave, selfless which is difficult to portray well. He should irritate you, make you scoff, but then make you realize that there truly is a place for such people in the our world. Now, we don't want a whole hell of a lot of them, but a few would do.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|It's a beautiful love story and a story about rising above abuse, and a hurtful life style.  There are also some humorous parts in the movie too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's. An  excellent. game. I love it . If  you  love  the  movies  you'll  love  the  game  .... Period..  what I love about the game is that u can touch da screen and make da animals move.

B000HZD168|4.0|I was great fun to see the ancient version of the Khan story after my curiosity was peaked by the newest trek Into Darkness. How things have changed, sometimes too much. We'll look back on the current version someday and have the identical reaction.
B00464AVXW|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with a well thought out climax.  Well worth anyone's time.  (It doesn't show its age very much if at all)
0345525558|2.0|I simply could not like the main character.  I'm also not happy with books that move back and forth in time, chapter by chapter, to allow the story to unfold.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I find this story to be extremely interesting and spend my time watching it trying to imagine what it would have been like to live during this time.
B005HED11Y|5.0|With the newest Star Trek in theaters, I loved having these remastered shows to pick and chose to watch. I got hooked.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun game kids love it I love it takes some time unless you are willing to pay. Some times it drops out or freezes but otherwise lots of fun.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Joe totally nails it! Amazing acoustics for a live recording. His guitar work is tremendous, and is not overshadowed by the other instruments.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|It was fun until when I went to the screen and it was black. I had to download the game again. Then, everything I had on the game disappeared and I had to restart. Other then that the game was great. I LOVE THE MONKEY ENGINEER!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I loved the action and character presentation. The story was simple and uncomplicated: good guys against the bad guys done in a novel way with comic book panache.
B004XQX4K0|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for... an under the hood style look at js.  Also does a good job of showing you upcoming language features.
B00AQA94M4|5.0|I love this album.  It is another masterpiece from Sammet and company.  He continues to put out albums where most of the songs are great songs.  For me, this album is up there with The Scarecrow and Metal Opera Part I, although Metal Opera Part I is still my favorite.  This album is a bit softer but has great arrangements, melodies, dynamics, and production.  Overall, it is an excellent album.  My favorite songs are Savior in The Clockwork and The Great Mystery.  OK, so there is a pop ballad on here, i.e. Sleepwalking.  It's not my favorite, but I try to find highlights in each song, and in this one I have to point out Cloudy Yang's vocals.  Her vocals are the highlight, especially her backing vocals near the end of the song when she goes into higher register as the song fades out.  A song that is a bit nostalgic for me is What's Left Of Me.  It is sung by Eric Martin from Mr. Big and might be enjoyed by those who liked the hair bands of the 80s and liked Mr. Big.<br /><br />Regarding the 2CD Deluxe Edition, I highly recommend this for musicians or anyone who is interested in mixes in the music and enjoys hearing each instrument.  I always buy the deluxe version with the extra instrumental CD when they're offered (which is not that often).  I find that they often allow you to hear nuances in guitar work or keyboards that you don't often hear when listening to lyrics or singing along with lyrics...which I do all the time.  The instrumentals allow me to appreciate songs from a completely different standpoint.  Even though Sammet is a great singer and I love his vocals, the instrumentals just add a whole new dimension to the album.  Often if there is a song I don't particularly care for on the album, I sometimes find that I like just the instrumental version as it gives me a whole new take on the song and eliminates the vocal phrasings and vocal melodies or lyrics that cause me to not like the song.  For example, I actually prefer the instrumental version of Black Orchid and Dweller In A Dream better than their vocal versions.  Actually, the instrumental CD is sort of like listening to an extended overture of the album, which is neat in itself.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was suggested by several friends and I finally found time to read it. As far as I'm concerned this is one of the most important, if not the most important books available right now. The science is easy to understand and it's a fun read due to all the tongue in cheek comments. Dr. Davis has a winner! I am shortly graduating with a B.S. in Alternative Medicine, have been studying nutrition for many years and am hoping to see friends and family benefit from the advice to avoid wheat.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This was so unexpected! The woman was centered, smart, willing, and could hold her own in conservation even of an very intimate and personal nature. The man could show his feelings which lurked behind dandy diffidence. This is a real treat.
0670026603|5.0|Fantastic book.  Couldn't put it down.  Glad I ran across this one and I will look for more by this author.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This is a fun twist on all the old fairytales.  However, some of the material is not appropriate for young children.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a great little apps for getting your mail easily on you kindle and would recommend it open quickly and easy to read.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The only problem I see is that I had to get this as an add-on. Apple doesn't like to make it easy to do what we want.
B002APU580|5.0|This is the best movie ever! The language is beautiful and I also believe it too be a very good adaptation of the noble.
B00B5VW1SC|5.0|I enjoy all of the Harry Potter movies and felt the cinematography here was extremely well done.  Once again the cast did an excellent job.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie was well made.  The characters were interesting.  However, the story was just too sad.  As a musical, it was fantastic.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|And it was fun, but not really satisfying. Suspension of disbelief made it hard to get into the characters and story.
B00BGIC3T6|3.0|I am big fan of both main actors, but still couldn't find a reason to give this movie a better rating.  It is worth watching once, but it really isn't even funny enough to call a Drama/Comedy.  I am 40 and whoever wrote this movie has some major issues.
1885167776|5.0|It got here on time and everything was done perfect. I have to read it but have not gotten around to it.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Interesting look at North Korea. Hard to believe that in this day and age people live like that. So miserable and unhappy with no hope for the future and all they have is uncertainty.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read an advanced copy of this book and was appalled.  I though it a great waste of my time and resented the fact that I continued to read hoping that it wouldn't just continue to go down hill after the first 150 pages which I found perfect and kept me going.  I have hesitated writing a review after seeing the 4 1/2 stars which I'm surprised about.  I loved A Thousand Splendid Suns and was anxious for this book.<br /><br />Why didn't I like this book?  As I said, I loved the first 150 pages and settled in for a great read but then the rest just completely lost me as it jumped around from characters and places with no sense of flow but rather \\"jerky\\" with both setting and characters.  In the beginning of the section after 150 pages, I actually checked to see if there were pages missing or another excuse for what was happening. I can't help but wonder how the author would explain his intent after the first 150 pages.<br /><br />I could not in good consciousness recommend this book and 11 of my friends and others who  have read it are reporting the same feelings after looking forward to the next book by Hosseini.
B007FIY3VW|2.0|The app is really slow with even the most simple commands and routineary actions such as moving around the page and deleting characters
1401207529|5.0|This is an amazing book detailing Batman's coming of age as a super hero. Must buy for any comic book fan.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|As of Christmas 2013, I've updated this app and fallen in love with it again. Many new obstacles and features have been added, and the issue of instant kills due to an inability to foresee dangers has been fixed.<br /><br />I especially liked being able to obtain a Santa Clause character, and the new water-based obstacles. Thus, I've upgraded my rating to four stars. I would give five, if not for the annoying and extremely difficult to obtain implementation of artifacts/treasures. More often than not, I keep getting the same thing (when I actually do get it), and that's in runs that last at least to 3 million points, sometimes even 5 million. So definitely not short runs. Thus, I missed out on getting Santa hats for my characters. (It may still be available, but what's the point when Christmas is over?)<br /><br />>>>>> ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />This game used to be a great game: challenging but still fun. With actual skill and luck, you could learn the general feel of what certain obstacles were like and have a decent chance of getting pretty far in the game -- if, of course, you had good reflexes and were observant.<br /><br />After the newest update, however, it's frustrating to the point that it isn't even fun any more. There are what feel like dozens of new obstacles, some impossible to see coming and many which are instant kills instead of merely setting you back and getting the evil gorilla on your trail. I've found that, instead of having a nice challenge in my down time I get aggravated and close the game. It just isn't worth the hassle any longer, to be frank; it's a constant barrage of things without any time to think.<br /><br />What was once one of my favourite games is, unfortunately, now relegated to the long list of apps I will likely not touch often. As it stands, I'm giving three stars to be generous. Before the update with far too many new obstacles and ways to instantly die I would have easily rated this game a 5/5. To me, this just feels like a ploy to gather more in-app purchases of gems to continue after your character dies. I really don't appreciate that, let alone how the game has gone from fun-yet-challenging to completely and utterly frustrating.<br /><br />Also worth note is that some of the added obstacles cause glitches in performance (specifically video stalling), even on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" which was perfectly capable of handling Temple Run 2 in the past.feels like a ploy to gather more in-app purchases of gems to continue after your character dies.

B003K07DUC|5.0|EXCELLENT movie; Matt Damon is so creative in his character - he really has<br />learned how to put a person INSIDE the character he is portraying....<br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM .... GREAT FOR A DRAMA, MYSTERY, GREAT FOR<br />THE TIME SPENT....
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The app is fine. It serves its purpose as it should. Wakes me up in the morning and it's easyt to use. I only got it because my phone wasn't working at the moment. If you need an alarm then this will work.

B00COH0W00|4.0|John Cusack is, as always, a real treat -- this is an older movie, the plot of course<br />is if two meet by chance after years of \\"seeking\\" each other by fate ...It's John<br />Cusack almost as good as \\"Say Anything\\" ....
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Not wild about dark things re children.  The story was interesting, but prefer something with a better or more up lifting ending.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I just started this and I love it. It moves quickly and shes a great actress. Lots of intrigue, complicated relationships, and just enough law that I feel that it justifies watching it instead of studying.
B005K17RU0|1.0|uninstalled it new upgrade terrible think ill try weatherbug or weather channel app. please go back to old version and ill come back
B004DMTCNM|4.0|Interesting plot idea, oddly enough, in my opinion it gets &#34;pulled off&#34;<br />even though it may at first seem mediocre, it picks up pace...A good<br />&#34;no brainer&#34; for those times when you really don't want to ponder about<br />subterfuge, heavy drama etc.  I recommend it ...
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was an amazing novel! Like couldn't put it down, didn't sleep all night when I had other things I should be doing ignored the kids type of book!<br /><br />Emma Chase writes in a refreshing voice that I won't spoil but let me say she has her character down to the letter while you read! You want to help the protagonist and yet you can see the train wreck of that person's life falling into place with every step, and you applaud it! HOW?! Because you can, because you are desperately cheering them on.<br /><br />I can't wait for more from Ms. Chase. The intimate moments are hot, the tantalizing torture our protagonist goes through is probably many girls dreams, and every page is full of humor and empathy all wrapped up in one. Great story, Ms. Chase. Look forward to many more from you in the future!
B005GI2O3M|4.0|[My review of the double-disc set copied to the DVD-only page]<br /><br />Overview: This is a brief (~44 minutes) 1993 German video-capture of a Bonnie Tyler concert featuring 10½ songs that cover Bonnie's beginning through to the time of this concert. The disc is PAL so North American buyers should be aware that they'll need a DVD/Blu player capable of playback and should also know that there will be a pitch change due to the format's 25fps framerate being played on North America's 29.97fps TVs. There is a 2nd 10-song audio CD included as well. The packaging is bulky and awkwardly stacks the two discs directly on top of each other. There is no booklet inside; the tracklist is printed on the back of the cover and can be seen through the clear plastic.<br /><br />The Good: Well, for an artist with 16 original albums over her very successful 37-year career, there is almost nothing out there in terms of live concert video, so it's nice to see Bonnie performing anywhere, anytime. The tracklist is a reasonable selection of Bonnie's hits, with the exception of \\"Race to the Fire\\" which was never a great song and feels out of place. Despite what the other reviewer here said, Bonnie's voice is in absolutely stellar prime form. Combining soul, power, raw emotion, beauty, and her trademark rasp, Bonnie shows very clearly that she's a great live vocalist. The band is a good fit. The audio has some issues at the beginning, particularly with static in the 2nd song, but this is resolved by the 3rd and is a competent 2.0 AC3 track overall.<br /><br />The Bad: The video is about what you'd expect for early-90's television: soft, poorly framed, uses way too many fades, and is letterboxed; it's nicely colourful though. The biggest video issue that I have is that they've put a large text-box in the upper left-hand corner that reads \\"Bonnie Tyler - Live\\" throughout the entire concert. Presumably I know this and don't need an unsightly, huge chunk of the screen taken up by this pointless labelling. It's not even tight to the corner; it floats in the middle of the upper left quadrant of the screen and blocks out a huge rectangle of what's going on. You feel like you're watching some kind of demo disc. The final song, \\"Lover's Again,\\" which is one of my favourite Bonnie tracks ever is cut off halfway through right in the middle of a line. Presumably the concert originally ended this way to fit into its 44-minute television air-time, but I have to believe that somebody actually recorded the last half of the song and it could have been included here where there's no such time restriction.<br /><br />The Ugly: The audience is, again, what you'd expect for television. There's only about a hundred people there, they're just kind of standing around, and they at times seem to not really know why they're there. Their lack of enthusiasm is really a wet blanket on Bonnie's zealous performance, particularly when Bonnie tries to get them to sing along and maybe two people in the room actually do. It just gives the concert a very dress-rehearsal/Solid Gold feel.<br /><br />The Verdict: I think this probably works better as the audio CD than it does as a DVD. Bonnie's voice and decent song selection make for a great capture of history. For Bonnie fans, I think this is a must-have item in order to see Bonnie live, an unfortunate catalogue rarity. For people less invested in Bonnie's music, the brevity, the cheap-looking/branded video, the tiny not-concert-like venue, and clear television feel are going to be big detriments. Such people would be better to look at getting Bonnie's more recent live DVD (the only other one of her career). For me, I'm a huge Bonnie fan and can't imagine not having this. Her vocals are in top form and this is a must have. 4-stars out of 5.s labelling.

B004ELSDZK|5.0|This is a very unique and challenging game.  You must study the game board carefully and chose your moves with care, because there is only once correct solution.  The object of the game is to link \\"spirits\\" in groups of two/three (depending on the level).  The spirits must all be on the same row or column but they don't have to be touching.  This is not a connect-three game!<br /><br />Pros:<br />&#10004 Very unique game concept.  Something I haven't seen before.<br />&#10004 Graphics are great.<br />&#10004 Options to turn off both music and sound.<br />&#10004 You can shake the game to restart the level once you have no more moves (ie: you lost).<br /><br />Cons:<br />&#10008 You have to shake the device really, really hard to get it to restart the game.<br />&#10008 Don't like Totemo's little stories.  Too bad there isn't an option to turn them off.  But there is a \\"skip\\" button in the bottom right corner that lets you skip the entire dialog.<br />&#10008 The game can get frustrating (frustrating enough to quit) if you can't solve the puzzle.  A \\"hint\\" feature would be nice.<br />&#10008 No scoring.<br />&#10008 There is one little ad that pops up (Radiant Defense).  But the game looks interesting so I might just have to buy it.<br /><br />So in summary this is a great game.  It is wonderful when a developer can come up with something fresh and exciting.  Kudos to Hexage.
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|This is so totally not my normal type of story that I would read. Even with that being said, I don't think I could have given less then a five just based on pure beauty. The story as a whole was almost generous in how it offered up the storytelling. Peter has a brilliant voice as and author and he brought each character to life from the moment they stepped onto the page. They each had definite and unique personalities.<br /><br />I am a totally fan of any really great ghost story. Ghost Whisperer was one of my favorite shows and I happen to be watching it again. This story is sort of like Ghost Whisperer in reverse. A single ghost, May, can talk to the living and translate ghost to the living.<br /><br />It is such a great story! Engaging and almost like magic, I even cried at the end. I have to say that if you are a fan of ghosts and paranormal this is the story for you. I will give a warning that this is written in UK English. Having a british husband that writes in this style I LOVED it. I wanted to hug the book when I read the language that this was brought to life in.<br /><br />Once again, I highly recommend this for light reading to break up your usual genre!<br /><br />**I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review**

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|10000000 sees your amnesiac wake up in a barren building, with only one instruction written on the wall - 10000000 points to escape.  How do you collect those points?  By venturing deep into a long-forgotten dungeon...and playing a \\"Match 3\\" puzzle game, of course!  The gameplay here starts with a different mechanic than the hundreds of other Bejeweled clones out there - tiles can only be moved by sliding the entire row or column at once - then makes those puzzles part of a real time combat system.  On top of that, there are lots of RPG flourishes such as single-use items for combat, equipment leveling systems and a dose of resource management.  The result is a fast paced puzzle game that's easy to play for a few minutes at a time, but with enough hooks that will compel you to play for more extended sessions.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's a great game to play to get out frustration. A lot of fun to play when you have a bad day at work. Lol!!!  Seriously I do like the challenge of the game and trying to get the extra lives.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app will help keep your Kindle free of clutter. It will speed performance by allowing you to get rid of things that are 'hanging around' for no purpose at all. A must-have for your library. I marked this on as a favorite so that it is always handy.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|After seeing a TED talk by Ken Robinson I was interested in reading his book. It did not disappoint me. The stories are amazing and it is interesting to see how some famous people had a pretty regular background (just like you and me).
B009T8XBBO|4.0|Fun game, simple in consept but that is what I like about it. There is a bit of problem solving involved that makes it just challenging enough.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this is a fun game, wish my food wouldn't spoil when I can't get back to the game on time.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|The album feels like a nice tour across genres and inspirations leading up to Daft Punk's previous work, and I appreciate that they're branching out and experimenting with more analog sounds. I was hoping for a little more energy and spectacle.
B007WTR2W6|4.0|We all dream about firing our boss and going it alone. It just seems so hard and full of risk. Here are some inspiring stories to give you hope.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I watched the movie first and I am glad that I did! I like how the movie presented how he asserted that his name is &#34;Pi!&#34;
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|After the first page I was hooked on this book, but then I read the first few hundred pages and became irritated, mainly by the narrator/main character, i.e. the author. The guy is just too good, and he always pats himself on the back or looks for an opportunity to. He reluctantly admits the flaws in his character or the character of others (the latter may seem endearing to some but it gets tiring when the narrator says that everyone he meets either has a 'kind face' or 'trusting smile'). Moreover, this flaw in the author's observation has more to do with his lack of writing experience than his ego. Many parts of the book are amateurishly written when you compare his work to great, modern writers who have written about India (e.g. Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth).<br /><br />The books not all bad. There are points in this novel where the writing is perfect and truly hilarious. One instance that comes to mind is the scene in which the main character must hug an actual bear. Other instances include conversation between Lin and Prabu which are at times priceless.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|If your tired of all the same old pop repetitive songs that are out these days, and into REAL talented artists that write their own songs and play their own music. Then you will love Jake Bugg. I love his whole cd. someone told me, trouble town, and fire bolt are just a few of his amazing tunes. Check him out*
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This series is very entertaining. We enjoy watching all of them. If you like Sci Fi, you will like Fringe.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I lost the one I ordered with my Kindle fire and this replacement works just fine. Would buy it again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The story begins with the separation of two siblings and their lives after the separation. The story is not told in linear fashion; it jumps around, across time (begins in the 1940s and ends in the present) and space (all over Afghanistan, Paris, California, Greece). The narratives are complex and compelling, too: each chapter has a different narrator telling a different story that adds to the overall richness of the text. In short, this book was fun! What I loved most about this book was how interactive it was. It's one big puzzle and Hosseini leaves plenty of clues for the reader to piece everything together. There are many issues which go unresolved until you read about it one-hundred pages later.<br /><br />FUN FACT ABOUT THE TITLE: I was at Hosseini's book discussion/reading today, and he said he struggled with the title for a long time up until he read a poem by William Blake called \\"Nurse's song\\". The last verse--'and all the hills echoed'--seemed to fit and changed hills to mountains in reference to Afghanistan's terrain.<br /><br />Have fun and enjoy!
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Olson was AP's Moscow correspondent for part of her journalism career which makes almost the total absence of the USSR from the book's story especially strange.  Burton & Anita Folsom's book \\"FDR Goes to War\\", M. Stanton Evans & Herbert Romerstein's \\"Stalin's Secret Agents\\", and Schecter & Schecter's \\"Sacred Secrets\\" cover the Soviet penetration and manipulation that so shaped pre-war, wartime, and post-war American choices that leaving it out, as it typically is in the highly laundered school textbooks is baffling.  Each of these other authors bring a great deal of new information and confirmations from accessing the Soviet intelligence archives in the 1990's that proved many long disputed assertions and contained far more surprises.  That isolationism drops so much in 1941 after Hitler invades Russia is the result of a frantic Soviet campaign in the media and administration to gain aid, vast amounts of aid, not a coincidence or ebbing.  Many key policymakers in the administration turn out to have been direct Soviet agents or continually duped by agents on their staffs,  It's amazing how this side of the story gets left out when TIME editor Whittaker Chambers confessed his Soviet agent work to the FBI in 1938 and the Army Signal Corps cracked the Soviet diplomatic codes and began identifying agents in place (300+) from 1943 forward.  It's as though the same journalists would leave out slavery as a factor in the American Civil War.<br /><br />The China lobby is missing as well, both Chiang Kai Shek's Nationalists who spent considerable cash and effort to swing American support to them with a particular focus on Wendell Wilkie after FDR's interests weren't turning into physical military aid (much like Churchill's frustrations which Olson covers quite well) after years of speeches and promises.  The Communist Chinese lobby was surprisingly substantial through the Soviet agents in place who dominated the State Dept. team (3 of 4) evaluating which factions in China to support and very thoroughly discrediting the Nationalists as though they were objective assessments (Lauchlin Currie, Robert Service, Joseph Adler, etc.)<br /><br />The Nazi lobby was far more direct and sizable than I'd realized or read as well.  Max Weber's \\"American Axis\\" does a far deeper job than Olson's book looking at that, including Lindbergh's roles and influences which in Olson's appear to mostly come from Lindbergh's wife's writings.  It's stunning stuff and well documented.  Anthony Sutton's \\"The Rise of Hitler & Wall Street\\" is also thorough and discomforting on the topic.  Along with helping postpone and confound American support of the Allies, it was more focused on acquiring key metals like tungsten, petroleum, rubber, etc. and production access/control of U.S. manufacturers' operations like the Ford and General Motors truck making factories in Europe.<br /><br />That American leaders were trying to buy time as they realized just how enormously ill-prepared we were to fight anyone after a decade's starvation budgets for the military to fund the New Deal and how long ramp-up to modern forces would take is very well covered in many books, Arthur Herman's recent \\"Freedom's Forge\\" especially well but also quite clearly in the magnificent multi-volume biography of George Marshal by Forrest Pogue that Olson references but clearly missed this element in our foot-dragging (declaring war with no tanks, modern planes, ammunition, few trucks, etc. is a common mistake in American history that these men remembered from our half-assed entry into World War I perhaps best covered in Thomas Fleming's book on that.<br /><br />Fleming's book \\"The New Dealer's War\\" covers the same themes about how political concerns far more dominated how we avoided, dithered, and then entered the war than is typically credited, making election strategy demonstrably the key criteria throughout FDR's time.<br /><br />Olson does a superb job at rooting out the mostly untold story of directBritish efforts to shape American opinion and a more balanced and deeper picture of the American First and related isolationist movements.  She writes very well, the book's a joy to read, and demonstrates impressive research skills on a huge topic which is why I wonder why such big elements of her story are left out entirely or get scant attention, especially compared to the Lindberghs who have a far smaller role than their media coverage would suggest.
B0053R3J7G|4.0|My wife and I spent some time on different parts of this build; i put most of it together, then she finished off the second floor/roof section.. :) As with the 5770 set, this was a fun build with the same complaints: 'hard-to-find' and Prestige for delivery..<br /><br />This time however, Prestige did not even bother to try dropping it off at our apartment building; for whatever reason, the driver dropped it off at the complex office. I only found out it was 'delivered' after my wife checked Amazon.com and noticing that at 7:30pm or so, the site said it was delivered at 1:00pm and she found a toll-free number for Prestige here in West Michigan; after calling them and finding out that the driver dropped it off at the complex office were we able to get it the next business day.<br /><br />Again, a fun build, just don't like the 'hoops' we went through to get it - this time I point the finger at Prestige...
0143121421|5.0|A very truthful account of the life and motivations of a spy. The chief character, Alec Leamas, appears detached from all but his pursuit of his craft. He is touched by the unexpected love of a simple librarian whose death at the Berlin Wall he chooses to share at the end of the novel.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|A different kind of sound in todays music scene. Hopefully they will have many great albums in the future. A pretty good album.
B006LUCV4Q|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever heard. Obel really transports you to another place. I wish she toured in The States so I could see the magic live. This is music you have to experience to believe.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This movie was more of a detective movie with a lot of action. It wasn't entirely what I expected it to be, but it was also way better than I expected.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|I love the whole premise of the movie, the prohibition era. Great acting and many twists and turns. Don't hesitate to watch.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|All and all this is a pretty decent lav, it is a bit hot so you really have to work with it, if the person speaks with a loud voice this mic WILL clip, but really nothing a little post production can't fix, clean recording, just a tad bit of line noise, the omnidirectional allows for great pick up of the person wearing the lav without catching to much background noise. Good purchase, I need to sit down and see if it works with my wireless lav transmitters, cable is LLLOOOONNNGGGG, but I suppose that's good since it's wired, but can be a bit of a mess and doesn't come with anything to roll it up with but nothing a little ingenuity won't fix.
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I've read all of the books and despite the fact that Tom Selleck is much older than Jesse is in the books he did an excellent job portraying the character.  I will definitely watch all of the movies.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I really enjoyed this as an escape as it provided pure entertainment value. I really like the cast and I am just disappointed that Season 2 isn't included with Prime.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Continuation of his first book Fall of Giants.  Had history added to the story line. Made me more aware of how cruel the Nazi and Russians were to people that did not agree with the government. Was sorry to see some of the characters leave and enjoyed the new ones .  This was a lengthy book but read quickly.  If you liked his first book I would recommend this one. If you don't enjoy reading about people being tortured and treated in humanly don't read this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I think he's my favorite character. That level if devotion doesn't exist any more. Now, On to the next! :)
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|Blake Shelton puts a very good collection of songs on this CD. The more I play the more I like it.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|I'm not sure about all the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game. The graphics are fine, but I've definitely been more impressed with visuals in other games (like Osmos HD or even Hex Defense). The backgrounds seem quite similar to the live wallpaper on my phone. Cool, but not &quot;wow&quot;!<br />The game's instructions are vague in some respects, and the mumbling spirit could use a grammar proofreader (&quot;be awared!&quot;). After completing the first area, and some of the second, I honestly can't see the 5 stars people are giving this app. I mainly downloaded it because I was suspicious of the reviews.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved following the lives of several families from different counties from before WWI through the war.  It had adventure and love stories.  Very large book which gave me a sense of accomplishment when I finished. I enjoyed having a history review combined with pleasurable reading.
B005544V6A|5.0|I really enjoyed suits, amazon instant still has a ways to go in their effort to take market share from Netflix, I would say they could go a long way in the organization of the site, and with some ability to go to next episode when watching a series that would track where you are.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best thing ever, and this app works great! I don't have a single complaint. Nothing but greatness!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game was very fun and unique. Haven't had so much fun. While playing a game in a long time.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Familiar and new at the same time, this game is a treat you gobble up like cake. 88 Games nailed it.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|The fact that I could only watch 30 minutes of it doesn't count. Can't believe they all sang live. Nice set.
0345529057|5.0|Picked this 4-book set up at a brick & mortar after getting into the TV show. The novels help pass the painful gaps between seasons.
B00C9G22R2|5.0|Anyone who love the grandmaster of cinema, Wong Kar-wai will be happy to see his latest.  No extras, but I rarely find them worth the trouble.  It's the darkest (visually) Wong I have ever seen.  Nothing happens in full light.  But it's beautiful.  What else?  It's Wong.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|cut the rope started off as a really fun game. Now more versions r cooking out l think this game series will be likecangry birds but better.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Was not sure if I would like it as much as original Stargate but it is just as good as original.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|very good Grease is the word great music and fun high school, we need more of these type of movies today
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Not one of Sparks' best. Felt book was hastily written or edited or both. Sparks can do better. But \\"the best of me\\" is,sadly,one of Sparks' worst.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book, you won't want to stop reading! A great book!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed this very much. Grisham as woven an excellent tale. An intricate plot, fast moving and reasonably believable. I give it four stars
B0087YYHZU|5.0|very nice everyones favorite musical for its time. love Debbie and Gene and Donald get dancing scenes very good movie
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|I was spellbound by this very gripping account of one family's experience of the tsunami catastrophe. The acting was superb and the special effects very realistic.
B004YM6JLO|4.0|no probs with the dvd postage fast and price good though wish was able to access Amazon rentals but overseas laws require some restrictions tho Amazon must be able to circumvent
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Like this app - refer to it when I want weather specific to my town.  The TV obviously gives me more information but since it covers the entire state, this app zeros in to my town.
B00AG472DS|5.0|very informative wonderful actors, kept intrest, some was scary but it was for real hope he is dead now for sure
1591843065|4.0|This is a great read for all leaders, especially for entrepreneurs. Whether it is a new business or one that needs renewed vision, this book is a good resource.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy Jeffrey Archer's style of writing. Just sorry there is so long between books! Good to know that the Clifton Chronicles are continuing! I thought there were only three in the series, but am thrilled it continues! Wonderful book!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am clearly addicted to this app.  Play it nearly every day.  Good to pick up when I have a few free minutes.
0385535147|4.0|There's only one problem with John Grisham...he can't write these books fast enough for me.  This kept me interested right up to and including the conclusion.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|No where near as good as Knocked Up but still not bad. Didn't have her sister, baby daddy or baby in it and offered not explanation.
B00CHILW64|3.0|It seemed more like a documentary, maybe it was due to the amount of coverage lately of storms on Jersey Shore and  Oklahoma.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|!!!!!!!!All Fast & Furious movies are beautiful!!!!!!!  PURCHASE IT I KNOW YOU WILL LOVE IT - GREAT DEAL AND<br />GREAT MOVIE
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I had more fun when I got my teeth pulled out than watching this movie. I only finished it cause I already paid 4.99. OMG 4.99.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I just send the movie maybe for the third time and said ill give the book a try. I'm at about 20% and this is a love story like no other. Love never ends.
B006SAR6P8|2.0|My daughter and I were all set to watch kill bill 2, took off wrapping, put it in and nothing. Says can't read discc. I take it out and flip it over and there is a crack in it. Because I got it for 4.99 I just threw it out as I did not need more hassle with returns.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Great understanding of the topic easy to read definitely a go to book to retain.  Useful reference across the topic also appreciated
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this in a day. It caught me the first chapter and I was hooked ever since. I have yet to see the movie and it was actually my main motivation of reading the book first. Now off to the movie when I know it couldn't be as good as the text. A very good read.
0553801503|5.0|Love the hbo series, love the books. Don't miss this series from a true master of fantasy today. Get them.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I'm not a true Bond follower but I've found most of the movies entertaining. This movie had the requisite action and twists and turns. It had a solid plot and didn't rely on the sex portion as heavily which was a nice change. The acting is solid and made this an enjoyable rental.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Pros:<br /><br />Pretty fun<br />More animals<br />Better combustion<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Very little time<br />Clunky controls<br />Hard interface<br />Completely copied<br /><br />This game is just Minecraft and some popular mods. I am sorely disappointed.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked the way the book moved along and brought you to a conclusion that was not easily guessed by the reader. ALthough the movement from past to present can be confusing in the beginning of the story, once you realize the connection, the story flows easily between the two eras.<br />There were moments when I found myself laughing right out loud because the writing was so vivid I could actully see the event unfold. The story included not only moments of solid humor but also moments of true emotional highs and lows for the characters. It is a story that demonstrates the strength of the bonds of love and of true friendship.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I suppose my evolved brain wins out over my endurance legs almost all of the time - I strongly prefer sitting on the couch & reading rather than running.  But I really enjoyed the book and concede that it has changed my outlook on 'the sport' of running.  And I'm definitely going out to get some Vibrams.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|If you are a Lady A fan, you will love this album! None of the songs disappoint and could listen to it again and again.
B00005JL2O|5.0|The shipping said 5 days but I got it in like 2 and it was really great because it's cheap and a great movie.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|The CD store at the mall wanted $18.99 for this album; I bought a brand new copy from these guys for just a few bucks. Rust in Peace is my favorite Megadeth album, and it's possibly their best work ever!
0307742539|5.0|All three of Steig Larsson's books are interesting and well written--too bad he is gone nd we can not enjoy any more of his talent.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I late to the party but I'm glad I came. A FANTASTIC story!!!  A journey I hope to take someday starting today:)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is geared toward Young Adults but I recommend as a must read for all ages, young adult and adult alike!  This is a quick read with a heartwarming story of young love.  It's sad, funny and touching all at the same time.  Fault in Our Stars is one of those books you will be thinking about and discussing long after you finish it.
B0084670FU|1.0|Really slow start. I didn't survive the first 15minutes without a star, just tribal herdsmen kids playing with guns. Might give it another shot later if I am totally bored to tears.....
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Being a HUGE fan of Warner Bros., I paid for it, it started to download, and didn't do a thing. It took my money and everything! A huge rip off. DO NOT GET IT! WASTE OF MONEY! !!!!!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The characters have so much potential but they are never developed to their potential. Tom Cruise acts as Tom Cruise not a very dynamic actor I do like his movies, I'm just tired of the one trick pony!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Have read many books by CH but this was the worst. I hope any future books written by this author improves or I won't be reading them.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|The guy has these roles nailed. The suspense, the cool, the hi-level action but at a believable level. Really enjoyed the story; nice job of a fresh story. The Duvall role brings a comic relief to a serious ending. Love that guy! Very good movie; romance, action, suspense, crime, comedy all rolled up together.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Impressive to have all of his works in Kindle. Makes for many hours of really interesting and enjoyable reading. One of my best purchases.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Fairly good acting for a mini series to watch on a rainy day. I might even watch it again if given the chance.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I learned so much in this story about emotional illnesses and fear and mistrust that I even recommended it to my therapist. This story allowed me to understand a lot about how my significant-other must feel.  In many ways I have acted just like the protagonist in the book.  I was able to understand fear and confusion from her side (the heroine) and I too relate to these fears.  Somehow the telling of this story as a daily building of knowledge and discovery led me, no, more accurately stated, tempted me to run after the truth and to understand and empathize with the missteps that the heroine took along her journey. I think that you will really enjoy this read. I can hardly believe that it's a work of fiction. Enjoy!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I have no idea if there is any validity the story lines of thighs movie but I really enjoyed it.  The cast was perfect and tough but not hokie.  I considered it a believable and enjoyable gangster movie, although probably fictionally based on al people.I expected a guest appearance from Micky Spillane or Mike Hammer at anytime.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I only bought this to see how it lead into the Avengers, but thought it was surprisingly good after watching.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is a big challenge to deal with all the ups and downs. This game is a really hard challenge, don't lose your focus, or else.
B00008FKDJ|5.0|This review is for the 180 gram vinyl edition issued by Universal in 2009. Nothing more needs to be said about the music, which uniformly excellent, so I'll skip that.<br />I first purchased Swordfishtrombones in 1983, no doubt in the first week of its release. Needless to say, after 30 years now, this original copy is a bit worn. So I ordered another from Amazon, delighted at the $14 price tag. What is really nice, however, is how warm and beautiful this pressing sounds, almost as good as the original.<br />So, if you like Waits, own a turntable, but do not have a vinyl copy of Swordfishtrombones, get this one before they're gone.
B00181JGI2|3.0|A cult classic I hear so much about and I like Bridges and Goodman and it's a Brothers flick. It was not what I was expecting but it was entertaining. I see why it's a classic,...just like Barton Fink.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Funny!  I loved the passion and humor in this book.  I enjoyed the play between the two main characters. I will look for more by this author.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|very relevant and will be useful to women who want to progress professionally, women should take Sheryl as exemple as she is a role model
B004A8ZX28|1.0|The disc was scratched and kept skipping and stopping. I will not order any more. Am very disappointed in this product.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Hopkins and Mirer are PERFECT! This movie is so well done; script, characters, cast, scenes, set, and soooo, well told story of this period of Hitchcock's life. I love the behind the scenes of what really happened. It kept me paying close attention through the entire movie.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Very interesting reading about a true pioneer with a somewhat desturbing personality. Required reading if you like history and has an intrest the development of information technology.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I bought this for my husband to watch with our grandson since we bought him some Star Wars figurines.  They loved watching it together.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|great movie. photography was awesome. great example of living out your dream and the importance of kids having dynamic relationships with others besides parents.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|it's  is so fun to play this. This app deserves 999999999 stars. THIS IS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY IT'S  SO FUN!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers I play it all the time I'm addicted to it its really cool and they give a lot of bonus stuff
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Well thought out script with a surprising conclusion that itself was thought provoking.  Although science fiction it based its premise on current massive expenditures of science actually seeking life elsewhere in the universe beyond our solar system but within our galaxy.  It relates the parallel thinking processes of scientific &#34;fact&#34; to religious beliefs letting the viewer accept both or neither.  Discovery isn't all about logic and cannot always be proven.  Contact reveals some original thought not based on actual experiences and for that it was exceptional.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Totally makes you want to experience the taste of Jiro's sushi.  Very interesting documentary. Highly recommend watching the movie.  5 stars
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Daniel C's first Bond flick kicks butt; this one gets its butt kicked. It fizzes  out after he gets shot on the train then it's all cliche mumbo jumbo wannabee action.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|A great American story. Valid dramatization of Laura Hillebrand's great book. Loved jockey Gary Stevens portrayal of the &#34;iceman&#34; jockey George Wolff.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is awesome or perhaps ledg...wait for it....endary! A fun sitcom with wonderful character developement. It's like Friends, only better!
B008JFUOWM|5.0|Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez team up again for some more adrenaline pumping action. This movie takes place after Fast Five. After dealing with being chassed by federal agent Luke Hobbs in the previous movie, Hobbs now finds himself asking Dom and his crew to go to London to help him take down a team of mercenary drivers. Once Dom finds out Letty is still alive he convinces his crew to help Hobbs and help him find Letty on the condition they get full pardons. Once again some of the previous stars through the past Fast and Furious films return, including Tyrese Gibson, (Roman Pearce - 2 Fast 2 Furious) Ludacris (Tej - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Gal Gadot, (Gisele - Fast and Furious) Sung Kang (Han - Tokyo Drift), and Elsa Patakay (Elena) all return for a even more packed Fast and Furious movie. When Toretto and his team join forces with Hobbs (The Rock) you know this is going to one heck of an action packed ride your in for. Hobbs knows only the best drivers can help him get the job done of capturing this criminal (Luke Evans). This movie is even more action packed from start to finish than the last one. Sure there are a few over the top moments as the previous one, but it is still one awesome ride. Just like the original film that started it all, this latest installment will entertain you and keep you on the edge of your seat. Just when you think the movies over they throw in a twist which bring on even more action and drama. I don't want to give away the ending for those who haven't seen it, but be advised to stay for a minute or so after the credits to see what is in store for the next installment, which also ties everything up just perfect and bridging Tokyo Drift to the present day. Also with the addition of Jason S. the next Fast and Furious movie is going to be just as good if not better! Special thanks to Paul and Vin for keeping this franchise alive, because without you guys it wouldn't be the same.<br /><br />Updated 12/9/2013 RIP Paul Walker, and thank you for taking me and so many others on this amazing journey with you. You were like family to many of us as you came in to our living rooms and we bonded with you and the crew. Fast and Furious will never be the same without you. You were one of my favorite actors and will sadly be missed. God bless you bro!P Paul Walker, and thank you for taking me and so many others on this amazing journey with you. You were like family to many of us as you came in to our living rooms and we bonded with you and the crew. Fast and Furious will never be the same without you.

B005S9ELY4|5.0|I love to see the bad guys get theirs . Boy , do i . Regardless of Mr. Penn's Politics , i love the guy as an actor . That holds true for this whole , swell cast too . Brolin is the PERFECT Sarge and so on . This film feels , to me , like what DICK TRACY desperately wanted to be . I'm truly pleased with the director's interesting period capture . Most folks to whom this picture appeals , will probably select four stars . Well enough . Noir this good (in 2013) earns the full measure from your's truly . Had a blast . Formulaic ? Sure . I love the blueprint though .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I viewed Season 1-3 on my Kindle Fire within two weeks.  This show is so well written and acted.  When this show originally aired on PBS, I did not watch it.  Big mistake!  I cannot wait for the next season to begin.  I will be in the front row.

B00ATX7FLA|5.0|These little ships are better for littler kids.  This one especially can withstand longer play-times because it doesn't have all the delicate protruding features that can break off so easily otherwise.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is a little more for younger kids. It is a little boring for teenagers but it is cute and if you are bored kinda fun.
B008N9AASC|5.0|thought provoking movie and visually beautiful. If you're looking for car chases and suspense, this is not the movie for you. But it is amazing in the breadth and scope of it's message. What message? That is for the viewer to decide.

B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|While Cloud Atlas was visually stunning and the concept was interesting, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. It scraped the surface of too many topics and didn't dive deep enough into ANY of them. If visual effects and several VERY under developed characters by the same performers excites you, this might be a good one in the theater. Also excellent for a rainy day nap.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I just thought that it was just amazing. I know that Rick Riordan is a very good author. I thinks this book is best for kids in the 3rd grade to 8th possibly.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Electronic group Daft Punk deliver a stellar effort with 2013's Random Access Memories, released via Columbia Records.  The hype has been going strong for the latest effort, propelled by exceptional single \\"Get Lucky\\".  Highly touted efforts often draw a `bandwagon' following by those who buy in or ire from skeptics who discount potential overvaluation. In the case of Random Access Memories, consider the hight worthwhile.<br /><br />\\"Give Life Back To Music\\" establishes a superb neo-disco sound and an infectious groove that screams `dance floor'.  \\"Let the music in tonight / just turn on the music/ let the music of your life / give life back to music,\\" Daft Punk sing, matching the danceable beat. \\"The Game of Love\\" comes over as beautiful and relaxed, while still embracing a highly rhythmic backbone. \\"There is a game of love...\\" and \\"The one that would be breaking my heart / when you decided to walk away...\\" ring-in as key lyrical moments.  Italian producer Giorgio Moroder receives the spotlight on \\"Giorgio By Moroder\\", in which he discusses his musical background, accompanied by a solid musical backdrop.  Gradual changes occur over the course of the cut's nine minute duration, though the cut never feels like a `drag'.<br /><br />\\"Within\\" has a more `tender' nature about it, established by thoughtful introductory acoustic piano playing courtesy of Chilly Gonzales.  Daft Punk shine vocally on the chorus, in which the falsetto lovely permeates through the vocoder: \\"I've been for sometime / looking for someone / I need to know now / Please tell me who I am\\".  Julian Casablancas (The Strokes) lends his vocals and guitar playing on \\"Instant Crush\\", another consistent, enjoyable number. While \\"Instant Crush\\" is good, it is the trio of cuts that follow that are the elite of Random Access Memories.<br /><br />\\"Lose Yourself To Dance\\" is the first of two grooving Pharrell Williams assisted cuts.  Pharrell's signature vocals (particularly his falsetto) is a perfect match for Daft Punk's retro-fantastic, late 70s/early 80s inspired groove. Paul Williams guests on vocals on the epic \\"Touch\\", a cut filled with plenty of contrasts to make its eight minute-plus duration seem like much less.  Here, a choir and orchestra are utilized beautifully.  On \\"Get Lucky\\", Pharrell Williams is once more on autopilot, playing a vital role in shaping the single to be the great success that it is. Add soulful guitar work from Nile Rodgers (Chic) and Paul Jackson, Jr. To the mix, and \\"Get Lucky\\" is nothing short of a `juggernaut'.<br /><br />\\"Beyond\\" has a group of touch `acts' to follow, but does so capably, without rubs. \\"Motherboard\\" is the first instrumental cut, preceding the exceptional \\"Fragments of Time\\", which features magnificent vocals courtesy of Todd Edwards.  On \\"Doin' It Right\\", Panda Bear swaps with Edwards, taking over the vocals, with Daft Punk also adding some vocoder-driven pipes in.  The album closes with the Apollo 17 mission audio sampling \\"Contact\\", which is mostly an instrumental cut.<br /><br />Ultimately, Random Access Memories is easily one of 2013's most triumphant and intriguing efforts. It never missteps, always impressing.  The draw is the groove and music more than the songwriting, but the lyrics are suited and often compelling to their context.  The verdict? I enthusiastically recommend Random Access Memories! 4 1/2 stars.Daft Punk's retro-fantastic, late 70s/early 80s inspired groove.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is living proof that graphics is not everyhing when it comes to games. I have pretty much been playing it nonstop for 3 days now. Love it!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Iron Man 3 by Gameloft is the Temple Run of heroes...except you're flying and there's  a real storyline involved. As Tony Stark you have to fly as far as you can through different environments while collecting Stark Credits - they help you build new Iron Man Armors. The armors are unlocked with ISO-8 diamonds before they're built. Overall this game is pretty awesome; the graphics are good, the challenges are fun, and the storyline keeps you engaged in the game. The only bad thing is that this game has been experienced several odd issues like the controls changing style on their own and random pauses while you're playing. Gameloft is aware of these problems and are trying to fix them.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|it's a nice new twist on matching games, but still in essence a matching game, so if that's not your thing, you won't have much fun.  i still highly recommend it.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is awesome! it makes slenderman play able for mobile! Its worth 0.99! get it... its epicly awesome... so great!!!!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Didn't really care for this movie at all. It was just a lot of vulgar language and not much else. Wasn't even that funny.
B00CW665VI|5.0|What a great read. I laughed so hard at times I cried. This is a very unique book. The story just flows from page one. I love that it is in Drews perspective. Great book!
B004TYOTAA|5.0|I put on my little Ipod and any bluetooth device pair with works perfectly can' t say anything wrong with it the only thing is that inside works 50 foot away but outside you have to put it over the belt even with the jay bird or plantroniks bluetooth ear buds
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I love this show. It is well-scripted, beautifully filmed, and Mads Mikkelsen has set the new standard for portraying Hannibal Lecter. He plays not as an overt madman, but is subtle and nuanced with volumes told in a look or tilt of the head. He and his surroundings are so exquisitely refined, it is like looking at art to see the settings, his office, and his dinner parties.
B0063M22QO|4.0|JUST STARTED SO IT SEEMS EASY IN THE LOWER LEVELS. I HOPE IT IS MORE CHALLENGING AND I CAN LEARN STRATEGIES. NO MENTION OF STRATEGIES IN THE INSTRUCTIONS. WELL WORTH THE $.

B005LAIIFS|4.0|I absolutely love this movie. I went to see it in theaters after watching the trailer, and I loved the movie. It was a very creative, very exciting and wonderfully animated movie. It reminded me a lot of the Avengers, which I also loved. I was disappointed by the DVD cover, because I personally liked the Christmas poster better. The Easter cover was a little dull to me. The movie was great, as always, but there were little special features, no deleted scenes. I was a little disappointed by the DVD itself - but the movie made up for it. The movie was delivered very quickly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Was told about the game by my 7yr old grandchild. It is lots of fun and you don't have to be a kid to play!!!

Of course the quality in today's standards was very poor but I kept them.  NOW you decided to place them on Blu-ray and I could not be happier.  Now I have my library of quality episodes.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great little calculator, sorely needed for a pad that didn't include one... it makes the Kindle less of a brick.
076115678X|5.0|I love this book! I just wish I had even a clue back in the day as an impressionable curly youth about these techniques. My mom had no idea either and we suffered through the years of fro days and frizz and horrendous classmates. May no other curly girl have to suffer! Get this book for every curly child, boy and girl, that you know and love! Educate the parents also.
B00633W614|3.0|This is an easy read, but the surprise ending will leave you expecting a sequel.  I've seen snippets of the plot in Mad Men on TV, or was it in Alexandre Dumas?  It's a good yarn, and the references to the cost of things in New York in the 40s will keep you amused.  You won't gain a lot with this book, but you can't lose, either.

084428596X|5.0|Okay, I ordered everything I could, and opened this one up last, my mistake! EXCELLENT book, not only does it go through the verbs, but in the very section/divisions there are fantastic learning ops with the examples. Eg: if you want to know how to work adding an adjective to a noun you don't get just a &#34;rule&#34; with one example. You get many examples, each with a new set of A/Noun combinations, with a translation beside it, so you are absorbing many new words at the same time as learning the grammar principal. I think it is the best and most contemporary learning tool out there for AMERICAN english. Most of the books and CDs are from Enland/english, which is sometimes a problem. &#34;sink&#34; vs. &#34;basin&#34;, sweater/jumper, etc.<br />This is the one book along with a pocket dictionary I will travel with for my extended trip to norway this summer. Ha det bra!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great tool, I really like how it learns my language patterns and suggests all the right words. Nice work touch type.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the thrill. Loved the mystery. Loved how the voices of the characters &#34;true personalities&#34; evolved and became their reality. Would make a great movie with Rachel McAdams and Ryan Reynolds....right?!
B004TI1WME|3.0|Great colorful big buttons which for a blindy like me with fat American fingers is great! People asked me when I used it if I worked in the store and knew where this or that was. It's very flashy! Well it doesn't actually flash but you know what I mean. So if you need a calculator with labeling then I say go for it! Why not?
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Needing something to do this winter I picked up Season 1 of Dexter, and I've now watched the first 7 seasons since the first of the year.  I love this show because it is amazingly acted, written and directed.  And it is so very clever.  My favorite season has been #5 with Julia Stiles as Lumen.  I may have to buy Showtime this summer so that I don't have to wait a year to see the final season!
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Although you'll need to connect two and three &quot;like colored spirits&quot; together in order to clear the puzzle board, the game play is no way near the same as games such as;  Bejewled or Atlantis. Totemo HD, when playing in Strategy Mode, requires much thought as to exactly how you are going to clear the board. By level 10, that becomes slightly difficult. I am currently on level 25 and it has become increasingly, much more difficult, to the point I've had to restart level 25  seven times and still haven't f found the solution....yet. ;-)<br /><br />The graphics and sound track are awesome. I like the Spirit guide but for me, as I got further into the game and found myself needing to restart levels over &amp; over again, trying to find a solution, I'd get frustrated and that Guide would become less cute each time. LOL There are Options for the music, as well as the sounds in the Menu if you'd prefer to turn them down or, off for better concentration.<br /><br />Any questionable permissions are due to having the option to post your scores to online leader boards,however, I do not see any other excessive permissions for this app that should warrant concern.<br />So, if you enjoy a good strategy puzzle-type game, then I strongly recommend checking this one out as today's FAOTD. It's also worth the asking price for those you that have missed out on the FAOTD
B0027MJU00|4.0|If you like Gone Girl you will like this also. Completely different stories but that same feeling of seeing into the character's darkest places. Some parts are not easy to stomach but I couldn't put it down for long.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|As the five star rating says, I love it. This is pure OMD, back to the old days, but with latest recording  technology, and the songs that I feel are some of their best ever, this would have to be my pick for OMD's best album yet. Keep up the great work guys.
0143038583|5.0|\\"To measure the efficiency of a complex system you need to count not only all the products it produces, but also the costs it eliminates.\\"<br /><br />Truer words were never spoken, but there is more too - that of human health.  So, coming from a Western rangeland ranch background myself, it's a subject dear to my heart;  my family didn't apply the term \\"organic\\" to anything - we didn't need to because it was, and no buzz word was necessary.  So it's quite natural I would feel that this is the best book I have read in quite awhile.  Michael Pollan is an amazingly talented writer - his words flow in an articulation seldom found in a subject that most people might find dry were it not for the way the prose is presented.  It's interesting, comprehensive, laid out in layman's language ( simple but elegant and thought provoking in form), and incredibly well researched.  It's a book that might very well help promote the common sense we need to return to within our farming system, and it vividly points out what is really happening with our food system through the \\"industrial\\" process - and the stranglehold big business has on the American food producer.  While we are \\"feeding the world\\" we should remember we are also feeding ourselves and what we do on the land ends up on our table.  Behemoths and the Corporation Farm approach to this subject are laid bare, exposed and quivering under his pen.  But he doesn't preach - he presents.<br /><br />I first noticed Pollan's work when I viewed the film documentary \\"Botany of Desire\\"  thus leading me to \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma.\\"  When you get through, you might be aware of a lot of things you never had the background to consider before, or didn't fully understand the portent:  the massive expenditure of energy shipping things across continents; the \\"importation\\" of food we should be growing here; the continual use of tons and tons of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides; genetically modified food (which faces an uphill political battle just putting that info on a label) (why?) and a monoculture of corn.<br /><br />In this thought-provoking book, \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" Pollan devotes a large portion to a man named Joel Salatin and his intensive, practical, common sense, natural world directed farming methods with the stats to back up it's results and viability in today's market - based on the ideal of producing food locally.  I also got some humor from it:  there was no alcohol or caffeine in Salatin's ranch, and after spending a day pitching hay bales in the effort to get into the experience of what it took to keep up on a farm,  \\"I was in need of both\\".  Frankly, from what I could determine, if those two items had been present as small creature comforts, Salatin's farm would be the virtual Garden of Eden to me.  (it might be uncouth of me to intimate that even Jesus drank wine, so I won't)  Being a child of natural agriculture background myself, (way,way back) I first became interested in Salatin when I saw his article \\"Everything I do is Illegal\\".  It caught my eye immediately - for those interested in the subject of health and how your food is produced, I highly recommend not only his writings but his videos that can be viewed for nothing on youtube.  He's not in it simply for the money, he's in it for the education of the public if they care to reason.<br /><br />The animals being raised naturally for food benefit too - this isn't just about people.  Respect, care, comfort and observation of the natural behaviors of animals as they live the good life before giving us their all,  is high on the list of \\"things being done\\" on this farm.<br /><br />This a good one.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I got this app in the hoped that I could utilize a larger drawing screen on my Kindle Fire HD, but every time I tried to open it, it crashed & made it very difficult to open on other devices. Until this gets fixed, it isn't worth having, let alone using. Other versions for other devices are are more likely to work like they're supposed to.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|Had seen the name before but not heard their music, but was completely blown away by this CD. I never like comparing sounds of bands but in this case I must for potential buyers. Think Goldfrapp, but with a slightly darker feel. Every track is wonderful. Electronics are rich and full of interesting sounds. No offence to goldfrapp fans of which I am still one.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|After reading all the books, I had to see this.  I enjoyed it. Can't wait for the next movie to come out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was great! the tension that built up made you not want to put it down. Authors' use of each chapter told by different character was brilliant. Loved the twists.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|The first is 5 years ago and only in bits and pieces. I look forward to those story lines more than the current one.  I am also certain this takes place in an alternate universe, as there are only beautiful women.  The current story line is of revenge and justice, which is a trending theme these days.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|WOW! This game is great! Best .99&cent; I've spent! Totally intriguing and interesting. Great game from finish to end. You have to pay attention to each step. Great graphics, as well on my Kindle Fire. Can't wait for more!!!

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I'm old enough to remember the original Star Trek series, and I have a deep affection for it despite its obvious flaws. I was ready to despise this latest reboot when Star Trek was released in 2009, but some terrific choices were made and I left the theater grinning. I was delighted with the casting choices four years ago, and how this new version of Star Trek gave enough nods to the original without going over the top.<br /><br />So, I have been anticipating the release of Star Trek Into Darkness ever since the credits rolled on the last entry. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />What do you want from a Star Trek movie? The world has changed over the past 45 years, and action is an essential element of any science fiction movie. Special effects rule, and the budget can be enormous for proven franchises that simply can't fail at the box office. There is certainly no lack of action in this movie, and it doesn't waste any time in surfacing. Kirk and some of the crew are shown fleeing the inhabitants of a primitive planet, after trying to prevent a volcano from destroying it. The fast cuts look like something out of a Bourne movie, and provide the first adrenaline rush. There are no shortage of similar moments over the remaining two hours.<br /><br />While I loved Star Trek (2009), it was pretty light on story. It served as a vehicle to introduce the new crew, and did so splendidly, but the actual story wasn't particularly memorable. That's not to say that it wasn't tremendously enjoyable. What Into Darkness does is develop on that strong foundation. We learn more about the characters, and what binds them together, but this time we're also given a story with more depth.<br /><br />The story is built around the hunt for John Harrison, who is a man that seems out to destroy the Federation. Who is he? What are his motivations? Needless to say, Kirk is given the task of tracking him with the Enterprise and her crew. Expect chase scenes, fights, battles, and all the special effects you could possibly desire. It's what you won't expect that will make you smile most of all. The theme of family is used in various forms, as well as revenge and the lust for power.<br /><br />The great thing about this reboot is that, thanks to a plot device in the previous movie, anything can happen to the characters we know and love. Part of the fun is recognizing events and people that you know from other versions of the franchise, and seeing where their story deviates from the one you expect. Into Darkness introduces a couple of characters that you'll know, if you remember your Star Trek history. I wouldn't dream of ruining that surprise for you, so I'll leave it at that. You'll also an encounter an alien race that you might be familiar with.<br /><br />I've mentioned that the movie is action-packed. Its budget also means that the effects are superb. But don't make the mistake of thinking that Into Darkness is all action and no substance. There are several exchanges of dialogue which create genuine emotion. This cast can act. One example takes place in a bar between Pike and Kirk, and it's an excellent example of key characters forming a bond.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the 2009 movie is that Simon Pegg didn't seem like the best choice to play Scotty, but he won me over this time. My only criticism of the movie is that some of the key characters don't get enough screen time, but I am sure they will all have their moments to shine in future entries in the series. As with the original series, the relationships between Kirk, Spock and McCoy are vital, and I think all three actors do a great job portraying them. However, it's also wonderful to see characters like Uhura with more significant roles.<br /><br />There's really no way to explain the plot without giving away too much. If you enjoyed the first reboot, and like these actors, there's a strong chance that you will love Star Trek Into Darkness. It seemed to last about an hour, but had enough content for four hours. That's meant as a compliment. You won't see anyone washing dishes for 20 minutes in this movie.<br /><br />Where will the franchise go next? I hope that it is a long and glorious journey. I would happily watch another five movies with this crew, and can only hope that there won't be a four-year gap between them.<br /><br />Go and see this movie if you care about Star Trek in any way, because you'll have a lot of fun. Oh, and be prepared to see more lens flares. They are apparently here to stay.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5<br /><br />This is the first movie I have seen in theaters since Roger Ebert's passing. Normally I would head over to his site to see whether his opinion was close to mine. It seems very strange not having that option.h content for four hours. That's meant as a compliment.

B0083GVG6K|5.0|SPECTACULAR!<br /> i watched smash- from. pilot threw Season 1, Ep. 15 \\"Bombshell\\"<br /> Truly worth watching .<br /> i wanted to watched it from the last episode up to where. i was watching. but said to myself pop some popcorn!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I was hoping it would be a little more entertaining than I found it to be. It wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but it was just sort of blah for me.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv. It is beuatiful and thrilling.  Everyone should give it a try.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|That movie was at the top of my list to get so I can watch it again and again.  What a transformation for her.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Wow, this movie was heavy and hard to watch, but so well done. The acting was superb, the younger actors were also just wonderful, none of that Hollywood precocious children stuff I hate. Everyone was believable. It was very moving, it is a story that stays with you, especially being a parent.

B004X2M9VY|3.0|The writing this season is not as good as previous seasons. The stories are lacking the psychological character-building seen before, and the stories also lack cohesion.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome graphics with no delays! FINALLY a truly engaging game! I am thoroughly enjoying this one! Would give it 10 stars!!!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|My wife reports that this was good every time she has watched it.  That must be about 10 times by now.  She says the acting was great and the story riveting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When I finished viewing Seasons 1 and 2, I could not wait to begin Season 3.  As a Prime member, I was able to purchase the season for my Kindle Fire and I am in the process of viewing it.  I have only a couple episodes remaining and wonder of the ending.  But I would hope that this seaon is not the ending.....I could go on with this story.  It is wonderfully written and dramatized.  Bravo for all.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This book captures your interest from the very beginning. Following Temperance through a crime scene makes you feel you are there with her.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|Great story about love found, love lost and the persistence and synchronicity that brings people together.  Performances were mostly believable except for a sappy ending.  Definitely worth watching--with a Kleenex!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We really enjoyed these movies.  Saw them in the theater and wanted them for our Bluray collection.  We were not disappointed.  Glad we ordered it.  Arrived on time and packed well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey has proven to be the finest story I have had the pleasure to view in such a long time.  The drama is suspenseful and the emotions are true to life's way.  The acting is superb and the period dress is tremendously beautiful.
0812993845|2.0|I haven't read the shopaholics series in a while or other earlier works like the Undomestic Goddess or Remember Me by the same author, but I do recall enjoying them quite a bit and found the heroines enchanting.  I don't know if over the years, my taste for chicklit has changed or this was simply an over the top, farcical comedy.<br /><br />I'm not even sure what to write since the negative reviews pretty much capture my thoughts, but the story follows two sisters, Lottie, who I found ridiculous, and Fliss, the slightly less ridiculous, who get caught in cliche after cliche of madcap antics.  It went downhill in the very beginning pages when Fliss anticipates a wedding proposal from her boyfriend of three years, buys herself an engagement ring and then finds our her boyfriend has no intention of proposing.  Of course it's public and humiliating because she makes it public and humiliating.  Normally the heroines in these books are quirky but have redeeming qualities and good hearts where it counts, but I didn't really care for either one and they both just came off as crazy and desperate.  Even the happily ever after was off since the book focused on the antics more than the love.  Overall the whole thing unfolded like a bad romantic comedy.  If you're a fan of heroines who do stupid things and get caught in them, then give it a try.  If you're looking for even a modicum of reality, then I would have to say skip it.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Classic Vonnegut. Does war make one crazy? Is war crazy? Wonderful read. Anyone who likes Vonnegut will love this book.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Not too thrilled with  the story as a whole. You figure out early on that it can only go a few ways. It's crazy and crazy wins. Not my favorite, but I understand why a lot of people seem to like it. I guess.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I found the story so uncomfortable as to take one to the brink of nausea.  I read three books, and then back to this one, for as many pages as I can stand.  I find it difficult to believe that this book won a top fiction prize.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Well, here we go again.  Just when we were able to digest and rerun the Lord of the Rings, we get the Hobbit.  Clocks ticking for installment two.
B00CJ1PXNW|5.0|These guys would have been comfortable in the 70s.  I love the style, sound, and general awesomeness of this album and band.  Almost makes me wish they released their music on vinyl.....
B004ELSDZK|5.0|This game is a fun puzzle game. Looks pretty good too. This devs games always look cool. 5 stars from me since the music was also good.
B003RUZKC8|4.0|Great cast, funny, smart, and entertaining from start to finish! I really enjoyed this movie the entire time. Definitely an underrated film!
B009AMANH4|5.0|This was very, very good.  Lincoln has always captured the fantasy of everyone in the country and it was great to have this historical well acted accounting of his time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A fun fast paced game, the only thing i found bad about it was the prices for new characters and boards.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I think the actors were spot on, and I really liked the kirk and spock dynamic. It is just a taste of what their friendship will become, and I look forward to more star trek films after this one as I am sure they will explore it even futher.<br /><br />I love the tos star trek, and I love this movie too. Give it a chance, you may just be surprised.
B00C061I3K|4.0|After their last studio album \\"Human After All\\", it was a little difficult to determine where Daft Punk was heading genre wise.  I personally believe they landed in the perfect place...\\"Random Access Memories\\" is a Disco Funk record, period.  The whole album really reflects the sound we heard in America during the late 1970's and into the 80's. I feel this was a huge shake up to the Dubstep & Electronic world right now.  The group admits they feel the Electronic scene is in a weird place.  To help prove their point, they recorded the album with real instruments (including real drums!) which is a hard feat when making Dance music in 2013.<br /><br />\\"Give Life Back To Music\\" should get any Daft Punk fan excited when they first start the record. It instantly took me back to the disco feel of \\"Discovery\\", however I picture a 70's funk band this time.  The typical Daft Punk vocoder is present which is exciting in itself but then we have Nile Rodgers and other funk greats like Paul Jackson Jr, Nathan East, James Genus, and Paul Williams. Although it's a little unclear on who plays on some of the tracks, Giorgio Moroder joins the band on the track of the same name telling a story of his life growing up in the music scene. \\"Giorgio\\" and \\"Touch\\" definitely go the most places as far as songwriting is concerned.  I love how the band jams out in \\"Giorgio Moroder\\" though...it is the epic journey of the record, and who knew Daft Punk has an impressive Jazz Fusion side.  Giorgio's voice annoyed me the 1st few times I listened, but 1. He doesn't speak for very long and 2. It actually sounds pretty cool to me now<br /><br />The talkbox ballads \\"Game Of Love\\" and \\"Within\\" immediately reminded me of the soulful Zapp & Roger, and so did \\"Lose Yourself To Dance\\" (the 2nd track other than \\"Get Lucky\\" to feature Pharrell on vocals).  The \\"Cmon, Cmon, Cmon, Cmon\\" part is funky enough to get your 80 year old white grandma to start dancing, and really does have Roger Troutman vocals soloingall over it in the 2nd half.  The 2 Pharrell tracks are dripping with funk and are certainly among the strongest tracks on the record. I could see the duo using him again in the future. After all of this rambling you'd think that was it for solid tracks...but that is not the case.<br /><br />\\"Instant Crush\\" featuring Julian Casablancas from The Strokes is an insanely catchy, vocoder saturated harmony fest.  You could say it's the \\"Rock\\" track of the record, featuring a Strokes-esque guitar solo and a very impressive vocal performance from Julian. I could see this becoming a single after the Pharrell tracks.  \\"Beyond\\" was a nice surprise to just feature the group and is one of the standout cuts from the album.  Funky-fresh futuristic grooves.  \\"Fragments Of Time\\" never really caught on to my ear buds, not feelin the verses too much. \\"Doin It Right\\" is very catchy but doesn't really go anywhere beyond the main hook.  \\"Contact\\" is a perfect album closer to such a strong set of songs.  Big reminders of \\"Rollin & Scratchin\\" at the very end with this track featuring DJ Falcon.<br /><br />EDM and Dubstep fanatics - you may have to sit this one out.  You probably won't get it. I give the album 4 1/2 stars - welcome back Daft Punk.

B00B0NDQPC|3.0|Something different by Emmy Rossum. It is not like her first album, but still very good. You will like it
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|His best work yet!! I was expecting a couple good songs but I'd call at least 6 of them excellent and the remainging good.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. What can you say about a Classic Disney movie.  We had to have it in Blu-ray.  We were not disappointed. Glad we ordered it. Arrived on time and packed well.
B005PK57IK|4.0|See my reviews of Seasons 1 and 2.  Don't watch this unless you've watched them and liked them.  The same formula continues, but with less Chicago politics and more office politics.  I don't see how any real law firm could survive with the level of back-stabbing and double-crossing going on, but that's clearly part of the Good Wife saga.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great story! You may want to read it alone! Shows you that there are all kind of people in this world, I liked all three books.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this light hearted foray into the antics of a charming, self-professed match maker. It's  perfect for a &#34;pick me up&#34; moment.

B00AEFY66U|5.0|As an English teacher in high school this is a good film to show. The dialogue follows the novel to a \\"T\\".
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love Downton Abbey, after a lot of trepidation.  There are characters I love and cheer for, and others I wish had died of their bullet wounds.  The only reason I couldn't give this 5 stars is the playback on my Wii was glitchy and pixellated.  Update and streamline your Wii App, please, Amazon?
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|We really enjoyed this Series.  Had watched it on TV years ago along with all the reruns.  Wanted it in our Bluray collection.  We were not disappointed.  Glad we ordered it.  Arrived on time and packed well.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I was expecting a pretty structured guide as in &#34;The 4 Hour Work Week&#34; and &#34;The 4-hour chef&#34; but this book was different. The chapers are extremely scattered. Instead of a step by step guide on how to cook more than scrambled eggs (who the book was marketed to), the book was laced with chapters on meta-learning, food chemistry and other irrelevant subject. As a result I quickly lost interest.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Unique writing style. I love how he goes into detail with EACH character. I want to have more, now that I have finished these 5, what do. Read now? :(
B005PIUQ74|2.0|Categorizes ME (&#34;CFS&#34;) and Fibromyalgia as 'functional somatic syndromes', a type of mental disorder. For example. the book asks &#34;Is it possible that Fibromyalgia has been as neglected as many other women's mental health issues?&#34; (p.808). There are over 5,000 articles in peer reviewed journals proving frank physical pathology in ME according to Harvard Med School Prof. Anthony Komaroff.<br /><br />I have purchased this book and read much of it.  It may seem harsh to rate the book only two stars since it is generally not a bad book.  However, the type of misinformation on ME it contains causes so much iatrogenic morbidity and even mortality, that I feel a two star review is merited.  I understand if you disagree.<br /><br />Pls correct these errors. Pls see the 2011 ME International Consensus Criteria for accurate info. The authors may also contact me for free expert help. Looking forward to giving the book five stars when this is corrected, since I have had a copy for years and have found it is generally excellent. Thank you for your consideration!
B0049GYXDG|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. Hard not to like a classic.  Always wanted our own copy and Blu-ray is great. Glad we ordered it. Arrived on time and packed well.
B00COMLLX2|1.0|It looked cool but wouldn't down load on my kindle fire h d. I had plenty of room. I have had nothing but trouble with the new h d fire. Apps stop working all the time. Had to restore it 4 times in 6 month so it may not be the app
B005IEGUDY|2.0|Rutherford did little to support his fiction as he did in NY. It is more fiction than historically supported epics
B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed reading this story about one woman who found herself while walking on the Pacific Crest Trail. Her story was interesting and compelling to see how she survived her journey. I would never undertake such an adventure but I enjoyed following along with her and could imagine how it would heal some of my fears of being in the woods alone -- at night.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This series was so good, that we can hardly wait for the second Season to be released.  Glad to see it is on its way.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|At times can be a tough read because of all the characters and places to keep track of but it is a great story with a lot of twists and turns. The third book was my favorite.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a great series, and I would highly recommend watching it. I'm addicted to this show...It's suspenseful and thrilling and will keep you glued to the tv.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really enjoy playing the game. What I do not like, when something becomes a mission, it is almost impossible to locate the item.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Cher is extremely underated as an actress.  This is fantastic movie.  Never tire of the show.  The supporting cast is excellent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said. Challenges you to think beyond the sex and realize that people can and do change when given the opportunity to feel safe and loved.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|As a Barbra fan, and from the previews, I expected a different movie. . .  It was good, but not the hilarious flick I anticipated. . .
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Caught Joe on PBS for the first time in the fall, bought tickets for Casino Rama in Ontario Canada, amazing talent as well as his band. Had to get more, I was not disappointed. Great talent, you should be hearing of him more in the near future. He needs to get permission from Ian Anderson  and add as a bonus track  the version of Locomotive Breath as a guest with Jethro Tull, that would ice any cake.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  We wanted to add this movie to our Bluray collection and the 50th anniversary edition was the perfect way.  We were not disappointed.  Glad we ordered it.  Arrived on time and packed well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book in less than a week. Only letting myself read it while at the gym because I didn't want it to end. Well written and you really feel like you know the characters. When it ended, I kept thinking surely this can't be the end, I thought my Kindle skipped a few pages. Overall a great read but the ending was a let down.
B005GRF2UK|4.0|Love the actor/actress. But not how the plot was adapted. Perhaps, time was not on their side. From a diehard fan.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I rented this from the On-Demand option on my satellite provider.  I wish I had wanted until it was available from a Redbox kiosk.  Definitely not worth the $5 I paid to watch it.<br /><br />It could barely be considered a sequel to \\"Knocked-Up.\\"  While Debbie, Pete, and kids are all back on the big screen - it feels like an empty hollowed out shell without Ben and Allison.  There's no continuity between the movies except for the actors and it feels like the same old tired rom-com for the midlife crisis crowd.<br /><br />Guy and girl are frustrated in marriage and are getting older.  Their kids are becoming teenagers and between dealing with a rocky relationship, bratty kids, work, etc. they are struggling to discover whether they should just call it quits.<br /><br />Bottom line: Save your money.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|My wife reports that this was a very good flick, though not quite 5 star, still excellent.  She was glad I purchased it for her.

B004SIP7AS|4.0|A lively and funny adaptation. Good chemistry between the onscreen lovers. The only complain is the Ms Paltrow was a bit too tall for her male counterpart.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|A Classic Movie! Excellent delivery of the crossorads legend featuring first class actors. Soundtrack by Ry Cooder couldn't be better! Steve Vai played a sensational devil's guitarist. The entire movie, cast, and crew was a hit!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|What more can you say.  Classic Disney in the golden years of animation.  It may have been brick and mortar compared to today, but it was and always will be a classic.
B00CL6GAD2|5.0|Great paced movie.  Good action and believability.  Great &#34;period&#34;  work.  Felt like I was there.  One of the better movies I've rented.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie is exciting, beautiful and emotionally compelling. It's a fun ride and well written and is spectacularly acted as well.
B00CS65JS2|2.0|I've been a fan since Homework and, almost the exact age of the Daft Punk duo, I understand their impulse to gather the most saccharine and neon-soaked tropes of the 70s and 80s. I look at this as a sort of \\"mid-life crisis\\" album. Every other artist, if they've been around long enough, has one. And, boy, is RAM ever one: it's bloated, over-produced, misbegotten, ill-conceived, and all over the place. When I first heard \\"Get Lucky,\\" I was slightly alarmed: a catchy tune, yes, but it just didn't have that \\"pop\\". The production is limp-wristed throughout. There's just no \\"funk\\" or \\"punk\\" in this album. The glossy production was especially surprising. There's no \\"oomph\\" or warmth to the recording at all---odd, since this was the duo's MO. For instance, I listened to LCD Soundsystem after giving RAM a spin, and James Murphy's clearly a better producer and recorder. They should aim for that kind of sound. Warm, analogue, forward-thinking, but timeless. Most of this sounds like dentist office music. My girlfriend, who usually loves Daft Punk, said, \\"What IS THIS?\\" three tracks in. There are a handful of good tracks here---Doin It Right, Get Lucky, Give Life Back to Music. Yes, kids, I get it: this isn't supposed to be EDM, and this is where they go \\"human\\". Funny, but this is the most mechanical and lifeless of their outings yet. I hope they get back to the studio immediately, because another 8 years...well, Daft Punk and I will be looking at the wrong side of 45 by then.

B008GJV4F2|5.0|This movie is filled with depth that requires one to consider how someone who has differing beliefs than the majority could be treated as a threat to their lifestyle. The out going main character reaches out to people through her passion for chocolate. The mayor is an uptight religious zealot unhappy with his own life and taking it out on the Mother and daughter by gossip and malicious intent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The only thing that's currently missing in this game is the ability to drop objects. for example, if you break a chest and have a pretty full inventory, you might just pick up what's inside the chest and not the chest itself leaving you with no way to get rid of your stuff unless you have another chest with room nearby.<br /><br />UPDATE: Sorry about above post.  I just found out that you can drop items from your inventory by tapping and holding the item In your hotbar
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I understand they tried to do the setting in Lincoln's time but there was to much darkness in the movie, also not enough action. I would have like to seen more of Tommy Lee Jones and Daniel Day Leis acting together.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Bought the game in the Free App of the day without knowing what it was about. Started playing and I can't stop! The game is genius. You work yourself to make your character better and its so simple that you just keep playing and playing.
B004IHE2B4|1.0|My 7 year old son saved his money to buy these tracks and when they arrived he was devastated to see that there was only enough track to make one ninety degree turn and a few feet of track.  I agree with him that it was a terrible value, would need to buy at least 4 of these sets to make a full track (nearly $100 for just the tracks!)  Yikes!  I never thought I would say that Thomas was a better value but hands down, it is.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really love this book.<br />Although I dont like the end of it, cause you are reading and it suddenly ends.

B007JNR4WI|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. Had not heard a lot about it and were surprised at it.  It was what we call a &#34;sleeper&#34;.  Not because it was a snoozer, but never hyped and a complete a surprise. Glad we ordered it. Arrived on time and packed well.

B003O86FMW|3.0|Much like the first one. a bit boring but hopefully a setup for the finale. The movie will be interesting
B000U6BT40|5.0|Eureka is a brilliant sci fi series. I was disappointed when it ended, although to the credit of the series, it went out with style.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I really like Tommy Lee Jones -  he is well cast as the Louisiana detective , Dave Robicheaux.  The atmosphere feels very real and its easy to believe this is a true story.  Well worth watching.
B004AM5QT4|5.0|Very good book.  At one point I couldn't put it down!  Ken Follett is en exceptional writer.  I look forward to reading more of his work.  Can wait to discuss this with our book club!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Always looking at weather on location and 10 day forecasts for business travel. Seems a bit slow on my laptop.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This seems to be a very good game.  It will give something to play when I am on a long trip and my wife is driving.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was looking for a particular electronic book that I was unable to find anywhere but through Kindle and downloaded it onto my tablet. I loved it! It was my first experience with using such a program and now I am addicted.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great family movie with good morals.  It's also clever with some throw back humor for adults.  Definitely worth the rent.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As aniticipated, the second book was a good setup for this one. I am half way through and fairly riveted.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|Man this was so awesome, almost screamed with excitement when i found out the record is pink as well as it is such a good range of songs :) a must buy seriously this band is so good :)
B001NEXEEG|5.0|People forget this movie as one in which John's character dies in the movie - the story resonants with idealism confronting the reality of daily living
B001NHNG64|4.0|The parts of the story where Reacher was crawling through the bones with the rats was a bit too graphic. I liked the  details of the ballistics of the shootings. Lee Child is a great writer
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I WOULD SUGGEST THIS GAME TO EVERYONE!!! I PLAY FOR HOURS ON END!!! IT IS SO RELAXING &amp; CAN BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING!!! I'M KIND OF ANAL ABOUT LEAVING ANY SINGLE CHALLENGE WITHOUT A PERFECT SCORE...<br />THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR HINTS... I THINK THE DEVELOPERS SHOULD OFFER FREE HINTS AFTER CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF &quot;PERFECT&quot; COMPLETED PUZZLES...<br />I AM NOT SURE IF THEY READ THESE REVIEWS, BUT I ALSO PLAN ON<br />E-MAILING THEM WITH THIS SUGGESTION...<br />TRY THIS GAME OUT, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!<br />YOU TRULY FEEL A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE REALLY DIFFICULT PUZZLES...<br />THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW!!!<br />HAPPY FLOWING!!! :)
B0083DJWGO|5.0|No doubt you will want to yell at the author more than a few times, and laugh out loud at some of the preposterous claims he makes out of thin air, at some of the fairly obvious self-contradictions and at the usual arrogance on display. But you will also come across some mind blowing thoughts that will stick with you. Taleb's writing is handlebar-shaped: on one extreme, some insanely awesome small tidbits of knowledge (that he either invents himself or is a superb aggregator for, across minds I would otherwise never have come across). On the other extreme, usually an equally mind bending and novel universal theory wrapped around everything. But in the middle: crazy conjectures, claims made without much data, lots of ranting against perceived pagans of Taleb beliefs, and just a lot of slog. (For example, he illustrates anti-fragility by lauding the success of city states vs. nation states. Across history and time. I guess we should ask San Marino for help against North Korea, right. Not a crazy point to ponder, by the way - but infuriatingly sparsely backed up or sourced, i.e., totally made up.) But get over that and remind yourself that just a few pages down, another wonderful and inspiring insight will be violently thrown at you, and relish that.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Great read.  I love Tina for her natural,  self deprecating humor. She must be a joy to be around. She worked hard to get where she is today, but she saw the funny side of it all. She is a talented woman.
093183841X|5.0|I purchased this book as being used, but it was as good as new to me.  It has been very helpful.
193700788X|5.0|Was a gift to someone special, and they really enjoyed the last Charlaine Harris book in this series, too bad this was the final chapter.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Picked this one up because of the conceptually beautiful narrative structure that was lauded in descriptions and reviews: distinct stories that span across time and civilizations, which turn out to be somehow mysteriously connected. Unfortunately, that pretty much is already an exhaustive synopsis of the entire book. The narrative structure is about all that stands out. In fact, the distinction earned by this narrative structure allows the book to get away with essentially just stringing together six stories that by themselves would be thoroughly unremarkable, if not outright boring. A young composer hangs out with an old composer, steals his books and hooks up with his wife; a journalist uncovers that an evil corporation built an unsafe nuclear power plant and killed a few people who found out about it; a guy who pissed off his brother gets checked by said brother into a nursing home with a violent nurse and tries to escape from there. If those stories sound appealing to you, go find a book to read for each one that focuses on just telling it awesomely. Because here, you get them delivered as the most standard (mediocre) fare. The fact that these stories are somehow connected only shows up in the most lightweight and unimportant of ways. Readers looking for a 'Lost'-style puzzle book will be disappointed by the complete lack of meaningful linkages. Readers looking for satisfying stories will be disappointed by the lack of, well, stories. Readers looking for increasingly annoying language (as the author goes to great lengths to have each story be told by the narrator in his own, perceived native tone) will feel satisfied, I guess. But increasingly laborious 18th century-style narration and other awkward attempts at making the different stories really sound different from each other through the use of language wasn't enough for me to call this good literature. Just a weird science experiment, if anything.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think hill climb is the best car game on the market. I wish that I could sinc my progress, that would make the best game ever! thankyou fingersoft
B00BESM14U|4.0|It was an emotional story. There is hardly any stories about sexual abuse on young boys. This story was a  lovely story about friendship.
B003IWRE3I|4.0|The stark, black and white, post-apocalyptic, world I pictured in my mind while reading Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' is forever laid out in memory in the film by director, John Hillcoat. The real world after a series, of fires and disasters have destroyed the world we know, and 'The Road' is as visible a film as any I have seen.<br /><br />Many rumors of this film and how it could never live up to the hype of the novel have been swirling through the Internet. What we have here is a masterpiece of a film. It is a powerful vision of a world ten years after some sort of disaster took over. The scenes were shot in post Katrina, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and what they call the 'Abandoned Pennsylvania Highway'. Into this harrowing world marches a man, played by Viggo Mortensen and his son, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, trying to find their way to warmth. The coldness of the world is marked, and we can feel the chill. What they encounter is a horror filled world, one in which a group of cannibals keep a farm of humans with missing limbs in their basement. Gangs of marauders around every corner. We see their day to day existence, filthy as they march along, trying to scrape up food to keep alive. They find a house where a left over can of coke amazes the boy, he has never seen it before, and they gorge themselves with food before marching on once again. The stark reality of their life is measured against the gray world where everything is dying. And in this world, the man is teaching his son about goodness versus evil. What we come to see is that the love of this man for his son is the light that may keep this struggle alive. The absence of a God is evident. The pureness of the son may be the antidote.<br /><br />Charlize Theron plays the mother in a small part, and she portrays the lack of hope that seems so evident throughout the film. Robert Duvall is the Old Man who conveys bits of wisdom. The son wants to help those who are crying for help, but his father tells him they must move on. They can only trust each other. This film is all about the father and his son. Viggo Mortensen is tremendous in this role, and he plays in every scene. The son is as he should be, watchful, hopeful, luminous at times.<br /><br />The agony of the life that is left to the father and his son is conveyed with such realism. John Hillcoat has captured the feel and the look of the novel. It was difficult at times to keep watching, but then I had to watch. We all want the man and his son to succeed. They are our hope. &#34;We're the good guys, they're the bad guys&#34; is the message the father is conveying. But deep inside there is the hope that the boy and his father will find more.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 05-24-13st move on. They can only trust each other.

B008133MDK|5.0|The casting, writing and production value are superb. If you love Sherlock Holmes, don't miss this series. Wonderful modernization of the sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories.
1451627297|4.0|Book is in good condition.  No complaints about it.  I have nothing else to say because I have not read the book yet.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Never thought I'd like a series about Hannibal, but Mads Mikkelsen has made the role his own, and Will Graham is marvelously vulnerable in his empathy.  The occasional episode drags (esp. when it deals with the daughter of Garrett Jacob Hobbes), but generally top notch.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Fun plot, good effects and action.  The characters were interesting and fun.  Classic good guy underdog against the superior villain.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this to use with my Samsung Note 2. Reading the reviews on xda-devlopers, everything was pointing to needing a larger capacity charger, as the standard 1mA wouldn't charge the phone well. This product was recommended by one of the users there so I purchased it. It arrived quickly and nice packaging. When I first went to use it, it wouldn't charge the phone at all, apparently, the little tab button was stuck in and wouldn't reach the bottom of the aux port. I got that unstuck and my phone would read being charged. The only issue I'm having now, that if I'm using my phone to listen to music or using the GPS, the charger can't handle the draw of the battery. While my battery doesn't decrease, it doesn't charge either, it seems to just stay at what ever charge it was at.<br /><br />*edit*<br />I just wanted to edit my review after following up with Anker. The company takes their customer's reviews serious, after they read my review, they contacted me to see what they could do to make my purchase better, as I was having issues with it not completely charging my phone and the metal contact pin getting stuck over and over. They sent me a new one, free of charge, that is working better then the original.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Very different but easily comparable to Pulp Fiction.  Not for the faint of heart, underage or saintly. Lots of cursing,some nudity, lots of gory killing. The overall theme is alone the lines of The Basterds. No body likes injustice and everyone hate a racist. Overall, extremely entertaining.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|not a new theme but very well done with action and love surprises and thought provoking scenes.a good surprise ending.
1926667131|5.0|Take your time. This one needs patience and repetition to break through the layers and reach some serious and transformational understanding. If you invest the time, you will get wonderful rewards in what matters most to you.
B00942G4UA|5.0|What an eye opener!  Have heard but never seen the way animals are raised and processed to feed us. Very enlightening.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Nice stuff and always good every few years to refresh your paste as it will become less efficient with time and heavy use. (keep in mind to use only the specified amount- can be less efficient to use to much)
B000I9W08I|5.0|Purchased this product  because our grandaughter was auditioning for a part in the play &#34;Hello Dolly&#34; and wanted to listen to all the songs and see how various roles were played.  So far she has received a call back, so I think the idea to listen and learn was successful.  And how can anyone go wrong listening to Barbra Streisand sing her heart out.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Read the book before it came out and have now seen it 4 times. Very interesting concept and blending of characters over time. Well written, Tom hanks gave an excerpt on a TV show and actually said a naughty word ((from a scene in the movie) and that was hilarious!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|...Giorgio by Moroder. All that talking - who wants to hear it over and over? Too bad, because the music behind it is great.<br /><br />Otherwise, this album is fantastic.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great movie!  Will be part of your annual Holiday tradition!  Just like Christmas Vacation we watch at least every Christmas time
B003EV6DBM|5.0|My friend loves Doctor Who and has gotten me hooked too. This is a gift for her to help fill out her collection.
B0095VPBFY|3.0|I bought this for a test of the socket FM2 CPU. From the previous standard of AMD I had expected this to be three cores and was very disappointed when it was only two cores and was anemic by my standards. My fault for not reading all the specs. From previous reviews read after the fact, I was not the only one that made this assumption, I sold this and the matching motherboard within a week and bought an FX-8350 which is OUTSTANDING tossed it in my Gigabyte 990XA-UD3 motherboard. WEI rating for Processor on the FX-8350 is 7.9.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I have more alone time & I enjoy games like this it keeps me interested to want to go on
B00BF11STU|5.0|I chose this rating because we thought it was a great move.  Great Acting by Jessica Chastain, should have won Oscar.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|it should open the eyes of how we see what is real and what is not and how people perceives the things we do.
B007XHWROK|5.0|i liked it and it was so nice. also, my friend enjoyed it because i bought the cd for my friend.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It had a twist I never even saw coming. When I read the reviews before watching it, I was worried that I already knew what was going to happen with the twist...NOT THE CASE! This movie was heartfelt and I truly enjoyed every moment
B0043M4TYY|1.0|This book may be fine, but without a better index, it was impossible.  A paper copy would allow for flipping through, finding, checking, mapping more easily.  Frustration set in and I never gave it much more of a chance, but I've never had this trouble with paper travel books.  A friend who travels a lot echoes these sentiments-- tried one e-book for travel and never again.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Very cute game. My 7 year old daughter loves it. Take care of different pets and earn more pets when you do a good job
B0037AGASG|5.0|i liked it and it was so nice. also, my friend enjoyed it because i bought the cd for my friend.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George R.R. Martin never ceases to amaze me with so many intricate story lines and twists and turns. Incredibly well written and impossible to put down
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Not a bad game but seems to me that it you will have to purchase game coins to receive all available iteam
0452295548|5.0|My mother recently had a stroke and this book helped me to understand what she was going through and ways to help her recover.  Wonderful book for anyone taking care of a stroke victim.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|i liked it and it was so nice. also, my friend enjoyed it because i bought the cd for my friend.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I love this game, except it forces you to pay money to play.  The app is free.  Once you get hooked, then they say &#34;oh you need to pay more money to play any more&#34;  I wish I could find a REAL free bingo game.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Well, it really hard to understand.....and its a dictionary. I don't like it. That's all. It needs fixed..a lot..more than a lot.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it kept my wheels turning. I liked the main character,she was easy to like. Great book
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|i liked it and it was so nice. also, my friend enjoyed it because i bought the cd for my friend.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Pretty good show. Haven't watched it since it debuted. Reliving the memories. It is just as good as I remembered.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|As a fourteen year old suicidal myself, I could really connect this book. I thought it had such a good message and everyone should learn from it. All of my life I have been bullied and abused making my suicidal thoughts come and go frequently. A rumor has recently stared about me that has really gotten under my skin and I am currently contemplating suicide. As Hannah Bakers life fell apart I was reminded of my own struggles. Even though in the end she did commit suicide this book has given me new found strength. I hope that you enjoy this book as much as I did and find strength.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I truly enjoy the whole show! I like the actors and how they portray themselves in the show. PG13 is also good because my kids can also watch.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits Season 1 is a very creative show. We can hardly wait to start watching Suits Season 2. Highly recommended!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|As a follow up to his zombie survival guide, Max Brooks extends the fiction of that work to present a really fascinating take on a zombie apocalypse. The stories presented in the book are both very entertaining and, strangely enough, even remarkably plausible because of how great his world building is, and in the end makes for some very compelling reading. Highly recommended to zombie fans, hardcore and casual alike.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Meh. I prefer their harder cyber-robotic sound, as in Human After All or Homework. This album is a bit too mainstream pop for my tastes.
B000FC130E|5.0|Each Neil Gaiman book is a little vacation, full of magic and laughs. He is a remarkable writer, and I hope he continues to write for as long as I read.
B00CM96A60|5.0|He is the king of Trance, and doesn't disappoint in Intense.  Great vocal tracks, great music, and Emma Hewitt... need I say more?
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was exactly what . I wanted from this book. It was everything I hoped for in reading one of Ricks books
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I enjoyed all but one of the songs which is good for a whole album.  It is worth getting the entire album.
B000FC13UE|5.0|Each Neil Gaiman book is a little vacation, full of magic and laughs. He is a remarkable writer, and I hope he continues to write for as long as I read.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love playing this game. Would recommend it for anyone who enjoys playing cards and<br />it helps pass the time while waiting in the Dr. office or waiting for the bus.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it . Works great . No problems my son loves it. The app is good. Wish it had more mini games on it
B006UUK1YE|5.0|No cursing, no sexual overtones, no violence. A good old fashioned movie with an interesting story that the entire family can watch.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|The special fx are great. C'mon transformers are the best I grew up with them. U can't beat the action
B008EKOO46|4.0|A product of the author's 50 years of experience doing fieldwork among traditional societies in New Guinea, at once personal and professorial, this book holds many rewards for the intellectually curious as well as for armchair adventurers. Diamond explores and contrasts in rich and fascinating detail, often firsthand, key areas of human experience in both traditional and latter-day societies, including war- and peace-making, treatment of children and elders, language and health. A fascinating journey that leaves you wanting to talk to someone else who has read the book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Apocalyptic world run by those who know best, who make everyone's choices for them.  Rich characters, full of the power of friendship and family.  A warning to foolish choices in the present.  And truth wins out.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|I really enjoyed the ending that this book gave to the series, Although I thought it could have focused a bit more on Rand.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I wish I had written this story myself.  Apparently I have to write twelve more words after that last period.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this CD and it would go good with any mood I was in and could help me feel better on any day I was bummed out. I can relate to most every song on here. Listen to the songs other than Sk8er Boi and Complicated. I think those are good but the other songs are much better.
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|This new Jamie Cullum album is different from his previous albums but it is still great. From old jazz standards to modern pop songs, there is even a selection with a distinctive 60s vibe which reminds me of the Doors. This album is very diverse.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|I love the fact that there was barely any dialogue, and that Kenneth Branaugh carries his role brilliantly.  He is at the peak of his acting power.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Really enjoyed the franchise and was sad as I started this book because I knew it was the finale. I felt the story lines wrapped up satisfactorily ,however, it felt rushed at the end. I wanted the Sookie/Sam combo from the very beginning and the romantic in me would have liked to see  some sort of epilogue with a romantic feel!
B002PDBA90|5.0|I am one of the biggest Porcupine Tree fans that there is, and I have just about everything that they have put out. But this one here, was just a little to far out there for me. I appreciate the ingenuity of it and the concept of it, but as far as the musical aspect of it, I was a little disappointed. But as a true Steven Wilson and Porcupine tree fan, I had to have it. As far as recommending this album, I am neither here nor there.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I am listening to this whole album for the first time as I write this. I have been a die hard fan of Fall Out Boy ever since I heard \\"Grand Theft Autum\\" all those years ago. \\"From Under The Cork Tree\\" was the first album I had gotten, and played it over and over, later getting \\"Take This To Your Grave\\" and doing the same. As \\"Infinity on High\\" and \\"Folie a Deux\\" came out, it took me a couple of listens before they won me over completely, and once that happened I couldn't get enough of them. So, having that history with the band, I expected to have to grow into this album as well, even though I LOVE the first single. What I discovered was a pleasant surprise. It's Fall Out Boy, but different. I have the great lyrics with all the double entendress, as I would only hope they would continue. But the whole vibe of the album seems like a breath of fresh air. You can tell they really enjoyed getting back together and making this music this time around. Like they were revived and it comes through. The same wonderful sarcasm is there, and the beats are great. I can see myself singing these around the house and in the car at the top of my lungs every chance I get.<br /><br />I don't know if this will \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" as it were, but the energy infused into it is a great start.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a way super cool game it is like a wold were you have a horse or horses but I wish there was an better Way to earn energy
B000000ORE|5.0|I only have one thing to say about this album, even though I could say a lot about this album,  THIS IS ONE OF THEIR GREATEST!!!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The game is slightly similar to Diablo in fell with some customization.  It is fun and doesn't feel to real money dependant except to reset skills it costs gems.  Other than that not much reason to use real money in this game.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I've started watching these Jesse Stone movies and liked them so much that I got hooked on them and had to watch them all.<br />Tom Selleck is great as Jesse Stone.  So much so that now I am reading the books (that's how addicted I am) and I can picture the character as being Tom Selleck, even though, in the book he is a younger man.<br />All of these Jesse Stone movies are excellent.  They are quite different from a regular police movie.  I certainly hope that they make some more of them.
B00932A4XE|4.0|The movie was funny and it showed the different things couples go through whether they are trying or not trying to start families. Definitely recommend watching this movie.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I don't read a whole lot of fiction, but this series grabbed me.  Great character development, coupled with action. It's taking way too much of my time, but can' t put them down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I like puzzle games. So this game really works for me. The graphics are lovely and very well done. The controls are easy, real pick up and go game play. The score is simple and gives the game a Erie vibe...almost a little spooky. Beautiful game and just challenging enough
B008Y79IUE|3.0|The whole sequence with the mother could have been left out and this would have been better. I fast forwarded through them.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|Kind of fun, for free.  The chase camera could have kept up a better pace than it did, and stayed with the plane.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Interesting intertwine of parallel stories, well written, and original storytelling for the adult viewer.  A great escape viewing experience that is believable even though it is cloaked in some fantasy.  Spectacular cinematography and interesting well developed characters, along with twists and turns that are unexpected will have you wanting to see more.<br />Great filmmaking!!<br />Highly recommend.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|A must have for George Romero zombie fans. If you love George Romero's Dawn of The Dead (1978) then this is a must have. Its a 4 disc box set containing, U.S. Theatrical Version, Extended version, European Version, and Documentary.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|Olafur's way with music moves me in a very deep place.  It's deeply powerful...you must experience it.  I'm a huge fan.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I love musicals and I never get enough of watching this one. The music is delightful and family friendly. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B004E547D8|5.0|honeydukes  A all time hit enjoy it every time I see it and<br />there are not many movies I enjoy seeing over and over
B00AKO93JK|5.0|The videos are easy to follow,your can mix and match which exercise types you'd like to do or you can do them all. I am always sweating after the 20 minute one.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|acting is like High school , really dull beginning actually gets better later on but look slik tom cruise had some face work.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I liked Tom Cruise's portrayal of Reacher. It hails back to his character in Collateral, which is my favourite Tom Cruise movie. The movie is well made and entertaining. Reacher is relentless and unstoppable and Cruise certainly captures those elements of the character perfectly. The author of the Jack Reacher series thought that Tom Cruise pulled it off; and so do I.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I love this group, especially their song, &#34;Hold On&#34;.  The cd plays fine and the music is good.  I only wish that the cd also had their song, &#34;It's Allright&#34; on it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the development of Nick & Amy's personalities viewed through their 'diary' entries. It was surprising to me to see both of them change from 'normal' personalities to just the opposite, and no hero in sight. I'm no prude, but if you took out all the f--- words, the book would be half as long.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Lots of fun. Different characters add to the fun. Keeps you playing so you can unlock different levels. Can't wait to see what's next.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The sense of honor these men displayed seems to be lost today. The descriptions of battle and the mindset of the combatants are eye opening. A great history lesson that revealed far more detail about the German people and their feeling toward Hitler and the &#34;Party&#34; than we have been taught, and the tactics Hitler used to influence and control the people of Germany. This is a must read as the likes of the &#34;party&#34; must never be seen again. If we do not know history we are doomed to repeat it.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|We had to go to the theater to see this in 3-D.  After all, we went to the theater for to see the other two Men in Black.  This one explains more about the characters.  It ties everything together.  We like it a lot.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|The book was good but could have been shortened by a good 40 pages.  Though intriguing at first, the historical accounts seemed to ramble on.  I do think it is a solid preparatory book though.
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|We decided to watch this for our family movie night on Amazon Prime. Perhaps we'll start at the beginning, and watch one by one to the one in movies now. Our son, at 10, thought it was very slow to start with, but even he got into it. Short-attention span or not. What a clever concept for a movie. Some of the dialogue among the original cast was trite, and forced. However, the overall concept and execution of it were great, especially for 1979. I enjoyed it so much!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Every Monday evening after work we'd sit down and watch our favorite Once Upon a Time episode.  Now we are trying to patiently wait for Season 3.  Sigh.....  We love this show.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|The reassurance that we are all in the same boat, face the same challenges and want the same things - was amazing!
B008SOS63S|5.0|If you want live performances that are so good they sound studio produced;this is it. Just a great performance by a great artist. He doesnt have to wait;he is already the next Clapton.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|One weekend we were bored so I rented this movie from Amazon.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  It had me sitting on the edge of my seat.  We purchased the DVD to add to our collection of movies.  I purchased two copies as Christmas gifts.  This movie rocks!
0955153077|3.0|This is a good start but the reason why it's not worth buying is because all this information can be found on the internet for free. I have learned way more via self study and youtube demos. This book does not give you insight you can't find for free on the internet.<br />If you're an inspiring Concept artist like I am look at great art, use google, and youtube, you don't need this book.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Of course there are some of his previously recorded stuff on here but also Clapton make an appearance. Its a giutar palyers dream and another flawless performance.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|We are Disney fans.  I believe we have just about every Disney movie made.  This one is very cute.  It's geared more toward the kids though.  It's good to see once, but we won't be adding it to our collection.
B003B02PF4|5.0|Had no idea that Grisham had it in him......  I will read this again...  Wow!!  Bravo!!  A must have.... Buy it..
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Absolutely a waste of time. Amateurish and pretentious.trying to be something it is not. Sad that Sean Penn was associated with it.
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|I watched this movie on a whim and after watching it I loved it and had to buy it.  So I did.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I thank her for being honest and telling the truth...  Yes, Lean in and get out of your own way.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is dfinitely one of the best books I have ever read.  The characters were so consuming fir me. I didn't want the book to end!
B000JML7YC|5.0|A simple comedy and satire on Gothic and Romantic tropes, Jane Austen 's first novel is an underrated gem that hints at the author's mastery of human character and irony. This is one of my favorite Austen novels because I know a lot of Catherine Morland's in my life whose ignorance is charming, yet they eventually manage to awaken from their stupor of illusions.
0385344228|5.0|5 brilliant and heartbreaking stars :-(    This story isn't about proving Jacob is innocent or guilty. At least I didn't think so. For me this story was about fathers unconditional love for his son, no matter the outcome.    Andy Barber is a 51 year old DA. Has a wife who is a teacher and a 14 year old son, Jacob. Perfect little family. They are well known and respected in their community.  One day, he gets a call that a 14 year old boy has been found murdered in the park, not far from school, with 3 stab wounds in the chest. He takes on the case. But pretty soon it's clear that it might be conflict of interest. The police find some incriminating stuff against Jacob, and he becomes a suspect. What comes next, is absolutely heartbreaking. Andy stands down and gives up the case.    The whole story is told from fathers point of view. It's starts at the end and can feel a bit confusing. It's starts with him sitting on a witness stand, talking to a prosecutor. You get the feeling that something big went down, but you don't know what. You also don't know if Jacob has been found guilty or innocent, or what the hell happened. And that's what makes this story a complete page turner.    You get to see how their family handles the crisis. It hits hard, all of them, the father, the mother and the son. You see family falling apart. Their marriage went from:    At seventeen, I knew: my entire childhood had been just a prelude to this girl. I had never felt anything like it, and still haven't. I felt changed by her, physically. Not sexually, though we had sex everywhere, like minks, in the library stacks, in an empty classroom, her car, her family's beach house, even a cemetery.  ***  \\"I am truly, deeply sorry. Truly.\\"  \\"Now say you're wrong.\\"  \\"Wrong?\\"  \\"Say you are wrong. Do you want it or not?\\"  \\"Hm. So, just to be clear: all I have to do is say I'm wrong and a beautiful woman will make passionate love to me.\\"  \\"I didn't say passionate just regular.\\"  \\"Okay, so: say I'm wrong and a beautiful woman will make love to me, completely without passion but with pretty good technique. That's the situation?\\"  \\"Pretty good technique?\\"  \\"Astounding technique.\\"  \\"Yes, Counselor, that's the situation.\\"  ***  \\"What?\\"  \\"Nothing.\\"  \\"You are staring.\\"  \\"You are my wife. I'm allowed to stare.\\"  \\"Is that the rule?\\"  \\"Yes. Stare, leer, ogle, anything I want. Trust me. I'm a lawyer.\\"    To:  \\"I did not share my feelings with Laurie, and I did not try to draw out hers either, because we were all coming apart. I discouraged any sort of frank emotional talk, and soon enough I stopped noticing my wife altogether.\\"    It's very sad and frustrating to read. At the same time, it gets you thinking: would you act any different in their situation?    The trial is absolutely brutal. Theirs and Jacob's friends are called to testify. Secrets start coming out, evidence against Jacob is piling up... It leaves them thinking \\"What? How did I not know that?\\" They start doubting each other. But the most difficult part of all comes when parents start doubting their own kid's innocence. They discover that he is not an angel that they thought he was. I would go as far as calling him a little monster. At the same time, all those things doesn't prove he is guilty, because it doesn't have any direct relevance to the case. The conversations they have, at the end of the day, behind closed doors of their bedroom, is absolutely heartbreaking.  \\"Do you think he did it?\\"  \\"Are you crazy? He's our son!\\"    Every time a \\"dark\\" thought (doubt) sneaks up on him, he tries to push it away with a memory from Jacob's childhood.  A dim memory of Jake as a three- or four-year-old boy when we had a bedtime routine: I would ask, \\"Who loves Jacob?\\" and he would answer. \\"Daddy does.\\" It was the last thing we said to each other before he went to sleep each night.  ***  I knelt beside the bed and circled my arms around Jacob and laid my head on his. I remembered again: when he was a little kid (...)  Certainly he would never allow me to hold him this way if he was awake...    The amazing thing about this story, and what made this book so hard to put it down was little cliffhangers or hints left here and there.  Laury was neither stupid nor belligerent, and in the end she paid the price - but I'm getting ahead of the story.    Or when they went to the psychiatrist and started confessing all kinds of weird stuff. It left me with \\"WTF?\\"    But the story had a lot of bright moments too. It wasn't all sad. Andy was a tough cookie. He was trying to be strong for his wife and his son. He even managed to crack a joke or two, to cheer them up. He was very cool on the witness stand, he was schooling the prosecutor like nobodies business :-). He never once lost hope, not even when the s***  hit the fan, over and over and over again.    The story had quite a few twists. Just when you thought the whole thing was over, something else happened. But the father never lost his cool. Not even at the end.  I haven't cried reading a book in a long time, but the very last sentence, at the end of the last chapter, completely broke my heart. I'm not gonna quote it, because it will spoil the story for those who are planning on reading.    Superbly written, engaging, compelling and heartbreaking story.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is addictive, you can't stop playing it. It took me like 12 hours to reach my freedom, great game!
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|A really well done period piece.  Gives one the sense that this race of people could have been one of the first to have discovered the new world. I am looking forward to the next season.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So many twists and turns. I could hardly keep up! Good explanation at the end. And quite a cliff hanger!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love all the cut the rope games but this one is even better bc 2 omm noms need your help. I wish that I could have a pet omm nom! And omg on the kindle this is amazing looking
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Kristen Bell shines in this role of girl sleuth. With the upcoming movie, interest has been renewed in an old favorite.
B008393Q2O|4.0|I would've gave it 5 stars if it didn't delete your checklist selection you're typing when you slant it sideways. Perfect for the organisation freak.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|When it actually starts, it works ok. Lots of times, it just shows the facebook logo on a blue background, goes to black, sits there, then the message \\"Facebook has stopped responding\\". Irritating. When coming back from a page, the same message appears, and you're done. Wonky at best.<br /><br />Update.... no improvement. If anything, it's worse. Updated recently and now I can't upload photos from the phone's own gallery or when I use QuickPic. I can upload through Intsagram, but that's clunky.<br /><br />Fix it.<br /><br />Droid X2
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very intriguing series!  I enjoy each episode.  I will continue watching it when the new shows are available.  Amazon delivers!
B0053R3J7G|2.0|I choose this rating because the guy that sended it to me did not even give it to me. But, I saw some reviews on youtube and i guess its a really nice lego toy.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Haywood is a superb artist who just seems to get better as he ages.  This is a first class album full of musical treats for the ear.
B002ZG997C|5.0|The \\"Book of Eli\\" is an excellent movie and Denzel Washington is great. A definite \\"must see\\"! This is one of those movies that you will want to add to your movie collection to watch again, and again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful story of the uppercrust in times past.  Love the history and the perspective of both classes in early 20th century. They are all actually one big family on some levels.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|it's a calculator and works for what I need it to do without any problems, what else can I say. :-)
B008TT7CXW|5.0|I hate carrying micro SDs with me in individual cases so this product solved that problem. I can now carry all my Micro SDs and an adapter anywhere in a single case. I take it everywhere with me.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Great movie and the dvd was in excellent shape. (used)  I read the book first then just had to see the movie.
0788859544|1.0|I am not one to complain, but I purchased this movie for my daughter and the first time I put it on to watch it did not work. I tried several times and then looked at the disc and it was extremely stratched. I am very disappointed and upset I paid for a movie  that we will never be able to watch.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Very good story that is supported by very good characters that I really enjoyed following. Each episode ties into each other and mow that I am on season three I feel they do a great job expanding on the story line with each season and episode
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great movie. Glad to see the cast together again:) Graphic at times but fillef in some gaps from the series
B005HSL626|4.0|The game is simple to play and very addictive. If you want something that you play immediately, this is a good choice.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I freaking love this game!! I would recommend this game to anyone, even if they don't like Sharks. It is soo addicting and so much fun, it's really hard not to love this game.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I have all the Angry Birds but this one I can't play because I don't have a facebook page.  So it was a waste of my time to load and try and play.  I don't have time for a facebook page nor do I want one.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|This album does an excellent job of marrying the old with the new to create an all new sound. Daft Punk certainly knows how to make good music and i was thoroughly impressed with this album. You have to go into it with an open mind as its not the typical daft punk youre used to but it still is excellent. I would definitely recommend the purchase of this album.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is so cool. When I got it for my little sister I thought is was going to be stupid. I tried it out and fell in love with it. And it is free!! I recommend you get this app to anyone who has a kindle fire.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It is so sad to know there were children that had to be adopted out. And especially to people that just wanted to us them as slaves. It was  a joy to know some of them found good homes or could take care of themselves and lead a good life.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This app is available on both Google Play and Amazon's Marketplace.<br /><br />The current update on Play is 3.4.3; on Amazon it is 3.3.1.<br /><br />I emailed the dev about this over a month ago with no response. I suppose Amazon customers are not worth the time or effort. A good product with poor support/responsiveness (depending on where you obtain the app).<br /><br />Edited on 8/30/2012-While they still have not responded to my email, they have uploaded two updates on Amazon since this review. I have since adjusted my review score.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app! It's so cool i can have as many alarms as i want! And i can set how many times i want it to go off and how often.it's very efficient for every day alarms. I can't believe it's free! The quality makes it seem worth allot more. Get this app!
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|Born in Pawhuska, Oklahoma and into the Church featured in this movie, I am very happy to see a movie featuring the beauty of \\"Green Country\\" in Oklahoma. Historically speaking, the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church contains the most famous collection of stained glass in the entire southwest United States, one which had to receive Vatican approval before it was permitted to be made. I was the organist for this Church for about 15 years and also lived for more than 20 years in Bartlesville. Seeing all of the sites in the movie transports me back to a much simpler time in my life: my childhood and the youth of my children. I thank the creator of \\"To The Wonder\\" for a wonder-filled walk down memory lane.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Had heard a lot about this series and am glad I stared to get dvd Will slowly add to the collection
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Imagine dragons is a very creative band some their music is motivating an uplifting especially the song &#34;it's time&#34; that was the first song i heard from them the song &#34;demons&#34; is uplifting the rest of their music is fun an catchy  also their music is clean the lead singer an one of the guitarists is mormon i know that does not mean they will always sing clean music but they are more prone to sing clean music listening form this first album i do not think there is anything to worry about<br />  Vocals great  combination of music great if you like this band you will like the band  fun!!!:)
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love his new album.  It has some very soulful songs that you know they were written from his heart.  Any Rod Stewart fan should buy this album.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great cast Great story line A must to add to anyone's collection. Awaiting next seasons . Only thing did not like was some of the great actors being written out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book deserves a five star rating. Because it was really funny and it is very! Very! Good
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I am now purchasing all my CDs from amazon! Got it quickly for good price I will recommend this to friends!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids are 10 and 3 and love these games! Easy to learn and play but fast enough to keep the older kids entertained and thinking.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Action, fun, and witches.  Lots of witches.  And of course a couple of really sexy witch hunters!  Can't wait to get the DVD so I can watch it again.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Truly a classic science fiction. Set the stage for many programs like Star Trek, lost in space and others. The effects were great for its time.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|I use it to stack my Guitar Rig Kontrol pedal and my Roland GR55 pedal on top of each other.<br />It was inexpensive, is sturdy, and looks good.. No complaints.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love spending hours playing coin dozer. Plays great on Kindle Fire HD. Great app from gamecircus. Would recommend downloading this game.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|We really enjoyed this film.  What it may be missing in action/violence is a potentially real life drama where actual events may possibly have occurred in movie viewers life. Fun to watch
B00BEFL5Q8|4.0|Nice to see guys like this still at it and relevant.  Very fine new album with a dark-tinged take on their former glam, pop sound.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I love this can't wait till it comes on each week and then have to wait for each season, it's drives you crazy waiting for the next episode.
B007SGM084|5.0|The series is amazing - Ive read them twice definitely can't put it down you will love all 3 books
B005S9ELVC|5.0|This was good casting and an excellent movie, really enjoyed it as I know anyone buying it would agree with me.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|THIS WAS AN AWFUL RECORDING DID NOT SHOWCASE HOW TALENTED AND AWESOME THIS GROUP IS. I HEARD AND RECORDED ONE OF THEIR CONCERTS OFF CABLE AND LOVED THEIR UNIQUE SOUND. THIS ALBUM SUCKED SOUND WISE.I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS GROUP LIVE IN CONCERT. I HEAR ALL THEIR CONCERTS ARE SOLD OUT!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Works as you would expect, good graphics.  I just wished it put on a little &#34;show&#34; when you win like some others do.  It just plays a little tune.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I finally have taken a listen to Bon Iver.  I know I am late in doing so, and glad I heard them on Austin City Limits.  I am now a huge fan.  VERY TALENTED.
B008R6MI8G|4.0|Movie has great actors and good content.  It gives you a glimpse into the conflict between the Brits and the Irish and how unfair things were back around 1916.  It is bloody abd violent at times but worth seeing.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This one popped up as the faotd so I grabbed it not knowing what to expect. Wow! Love the graphics! And the sound is catchy but not kind that has you wanting to pound you head to make it stop. Love it. The course changes every time you start, so you're not just running over the same track all the time -  kudos to the developers. I actually can't find anything negative about it. Start off with a basic vehicle and a driver and add vehicle upgrades as you collect coins along your trip. Pick another driver or another vehicle. Different capabilities of each keep it interesting. Once you have all the drivers and all the vehicles and all the power options, you can get into some of the special options - like the air lift. That one uses a lot of your coins so you won't be using it to get started, but work your way into it. Fun to watch the little things you usually don't notice until some one tells you about them like tracks in the sand and on the wooden bridge surfaces as you corner around them. Attention to detail is excellent!<br />5 stars only because ther aren't more! Highly recommend if you like 'driving' type games. Tops on MY list!
B00340LM8C|3.0|Interesting script and fun to see the old actors, but as with many of these old movies, the music is overpowering.  There is no such thing as silence between dialog events.  The orchestra music blares on and on as one scene moves to another and sometimes it overpowers the dialog.  Nice to watch, but we are glad the movie industry stopped the awful loud dramatic music.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Once you get into this one you start to figure out when to use the gas and when NOT to. Simple controls and easy to use. May look a bit cartoonish but plays like real life. Get your upgrades as you roll along and use them. See the differences each of the upgrades make. Improve your power and handling to go farther and faster. You can go like &#34;Smokey and the Bandit&#34; and jump the bridge, but be careful as the results will likely be the same (not quite what you saw in the movie). Simple, easy, fun, intuitive. Give it a try. Nothing to lose! Looks & plays great on my KFHD.
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|Red, okay, action Bruice Willis again same action filled movie.  Nothing different from Bruice Wills. Would recommend to friends especially friends that enjoy action filled movies.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A simple &#34;match 2&#34; game. Just touch 2 matching cubes and they go away, revealing some more. Easy to play and the graphics are quite good. A one-minute challenge is one to try for a diversion from the whole cube puzzle. If you haven't played with it before you will find it taking about 8 minutes or so to clear the entire cube, but your times will get better with practice. I have gotten to the 4 and a half minutes mark, but it took a while to do that. This game has no real history other than the best time for the puzzle and the highest total for the one-minute game. More interesting than mahjong but the concept is about the same. You move the cube around to find the match - it might be on the same side of the cube that you are on or it could be on one of the 5 other sides. Plays and looks good on my KFHD. Worth giving a try!
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|Trouble With the Curve is more about relationships and human nature than baseball.  Clint Eastwood always does an excellent job and this is no exception.  Highly recommend buying (I rented it twice for company and then decided I may as well buy it because I never get tired of watching it)!
B006M4F67A|3.0|Plays well and looks good. The biggest complaint I have is the number of Mahjong tiles and the size of the screen. Maybe it's just my fingers are too big. I can play the game but I lose interest in it before I can play it again - once is enough. So I only play it when I reallly get tired of other games, or rarely. Still, if you like the game it does a good job. Graphics are very good. Layouts offer different challenges. Not a bad game at all, just not the top of MY list. Give it a try, it might make the top of YOUR list!
B00632HWOG|4.0|consistent service, easy to use, filters do a good job, the stationary feature is something friends always ask about,  like the security checks that are done periodically.....i think you can have 3 accounts active for no charge.  Aloha M
B0063GORYU|5.0|MobilityWare really hit the grand slam with Spider, Free Cell, and Solitaire! Without a doubt the best of solitaire games available! My KFHD plays them all well and looks good doing it! The only thing I don't quite get is the deal selections, mainly the 'Winning deal' since I have yet to win a hand when selecting it. 'Random deal' has given me all of my wins. Other than that I have absolutely no regrets with any of their products. If you enjoy solitaire you will love this!  Graphics and play are fantastic! I haven't seen any of these games look as good on a PC! Top rated in my book. Get this one, or one of the others, and the 'ads' between games will sooner or later offer the others for a quick download. Glad I found this one! Can't recommend it high enough! EXCELLENT!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|The Bushnell arrived on time and in perfect condition. It takes a little getting accustomed to sighting but after 8 or 9 distances I haven't had any difficulty at all. It works great on the range helping me with identifying  correct clubs and swings that produces confident choices on the course. I would highly recommend to anyone who is attempting to improve their game. The only draw back is everyone playing in your group will ask for your assistance.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Touching the screen activates the the jetpack. That's really all you need to know to get started. Graphics & sound are quite good and the game challenge is reasonable. As far as things you run into - well, trial and error will soon show you when you get it wrong. I have no idea how far it goes or what the results would be if one were to reach the end of the run, but it is interesting and new things get in your way as you make progress. Very easy to get going and you go farther if you pay attention to what's coming. 5 stars just for the fun of it. If you are looking for something to do that you don't have to wrap your head around to do you will enjoy this one. Give it a shot!
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|It kept my Attention, just not my favorite movie.  It's been awhile since I've seen it, so I don't remember the particulars of why I didn't like it.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|Another great Disney flick for the kids.  Great animation, exciting story that will keep older kids....and even some adults....attention for the whole movie.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|I just had the intense pleasure of reading the entire saga, in order.  What a treat!  Seldom have I found a series that consistently grabs and holds throughout the books like Bujold does in this series!  Her insane sense of humor is rampant, but never detracts from the story line or the action.  And she often drops &#34;bon mots&#34; for thought to add to the overall value.  If you have a chance, I strongly recommend &#34;going the course&#34; and reading the entire saga through from beginning to &#34;current&#34; end.  And I am hoping that we have not yet seen the end of this rich and varied universe and people!
B007H7XJD4|3.0|Ok flick, no 300 that's for sure.  Good action and cool effects, but overall pretty mediocre.  If you are in a bind for a movie...it will do.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I started off not thinking I'd like this book, but it had a lot of twists and turns that kept sparking my interest.  The book kept going back and forth between his very colorful life, and his current adventures.  An extremely low-key guy that manages to attract interesting people into his life.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Brought the product based on some others received from friends and thought it would be fun.  VERY disappointed and it difficult to figure out how to use.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Vapid, listless, morally ambiguous, lifeless, a faltering mish mash of leftovers and that's the best I can say about this book. I wanted it to be a great read with a charming heroine bravely discovering the supernatural world around her. It is NOT that book. It is a book thrown together and then foisted on a gullible public who gave CH the benefit of the doubt that she wouldn't let us down. She did. Not another dollar will I send your way, CH -EVER!!!
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|I loved each and every song! Some sound quite pop, but I must admit Jamie has done a great work! He's such a talented musician! I totally recommend his new album.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|What a super storyteller! Archer keeps you glued to his book. You can't put it down and he has you yearning for the next installment. Like his two previous Clifton Chronicles this one is so well crafted it draws you in and will not let you go.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|hosseini's  first two books were great, i thought 1000 splendid suns was even better than kite runner; this one paled by comparison; good writier but he skipped around from character to character & decade to decade thoughout the story; i was hard to keep track of who is he was following; just not up to the standard set by his first two works
B007KQI1NA|4.0|Fine GPS, gets the job done, mostly. I have had a couple issues running it on Win8 machines - it seems to go away for a few minutes every couple hours. No reports of such issues on Win7, so I suspect the GPS drivers are not playing perfectly with Win8, still. It *is* a Prolific chipset, after all, so what do you expect? At least I don't see bluescreens from them anymore.<br /><br />Also, I have some concerns the S4 is not actually doing the WAAS dance all the time. (the older S3 seems more accurate...but of course doesn't work on Win8 because Prolific deprecated support for the S3's chipset and didn't code up a Win8-compatible driver...).<br /><br />In any case, these are now my backups for the 368i Bluetooth, or for custom setups where the bluetooth won't work (big metal ship structures between antenna and PC, or if the antenna has to be out in the weather, etc.).<br /><br />Overall, a nice little disposable USB GPS - best one I have found so far.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Very action packed. Not as good as book, but very good in my opinion.I showed it to my High school class after reading the book...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I love lawyer books and this one held my  interest througout.  I did not anticipate the ending and it was perfect.
B0063GORYU|3.0|spider solitaire is great card game. i like other solitaire games as well, such as cresent solitaire, pyramid and klondike, vegas and cruel versions. spider is always fun.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|The book started out to be a fun read and it mostly was except it would appeal to a younger reader.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i like the fact there are several levels for the buck. all majong game are fun.i play all kinda af mahjong games to relax after a hard day at work
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|Matching swords and stuff gets old real fast. Basically you run around killin hing by lining up shields swords or wands to kill monsters. I would not really recommend this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|what a refreshing change from reg tv series.  this is definitely classy and well done.  a literary classic.  i love and identify with the characters and find it wonderful in that it is historical, but currently relevant.  a PBS masterpiece for sure.
B00992CF6W|2.0|At first I thought this game was cool, but then I tried survival craft.  There are so many more things that that app has that this one doesn't.  It has more mobs, more items, it has caves, and the world size is huge if not unlimited.  Also, it is only 3.99$.  I suggest you give it a try.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very addicting extremely fun ones you start can't stop going on through level and levels recommended to anybody that likes a challenge
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I downloaded this game for my 4yr old son, and I play it more than he does! It's yet another game, however, that has some limitations if you don't want to buy additional credits out of pocket.  But overall, I myself am addicted! And the graphics are as beautiful as the movie.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I read the book after watching the movie. And as soon as I finished the I re watched the movie. I do like them both. Book is quite different from the screen version. Especially what concerns Pat relationships with his Dad and friends. I wish they had make it he same way in the movie, but on the other side the end of the movie is much better for me than the end of the book still it's happy ending.<br />The book is very optimistic. I really enjoyed if and was sorry when it ended. It didn't become my favorite one, but it had it magic on me!
0064431789|2.0|This book is not something I have chosen to share with my children. I thought time would change my opinion of the book, yet I was disappointed.
B00AFG6HWO|4.0|Mr. Bartos complains a lot about how he was mistreated during his time in Kraftwerk. Tried to distance himself for a while as well. But, this sounds more like a Kraftwerk album than a solo album. Even talks about his former band. I really wish they would all bury some hatchets and get back together. (Wolfgang could use some $$ I'm sure) There is an unused Electronic track that is quite good.
0920668372|2.0|While the premise for the book is good. It gets too creepy when mom starts climbing in his bedroom window.
B009712ESO|5.0|Kinda funny how PSB still have it in them to produce a great track like this. Sounds like something from the 1987-1990 phase.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies is this year. The soundtrack is amazing great job on the score my M83. Tom Cruise is good as always.  Must watch for anyone who likes scifi. I you liked tron legacy even a little bit you will love this.
B0039HR5QS|5.0|An involving well written political conspiracy story with fine acting from major and minor players and very well directed by Sidney Pollack. Certainly worth re-seeing.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I didn't like anything about this game. I didn't keep it on my kindle for very long at all. Sorry
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Excellent build-up of chacters and a smooth sail through the three-book series.  If you hve a long time between books, the author does an excellent job of &#34;catching you up&#34; as you re-join the saga.
B000H3096A|5.0|Hutcherson is one of the modern masters of the vibraphone and so this album, recorded as he was exploding on the scene and doing a lot of playing with Dolphy and Sonny Simmons and others, is an important piece of his history. The album is in/out, comfortably moving from hard Bop to more avant sounds. The last cut leaps out at you: a piece of contemporary concert music, beautifully composed, which finds Hutcherson at the marimba. If you are a mallets player--or a fan of this family of instruments--go ahead: order this.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I don't knwo why i like this show so much, but I do. great suspense, just enough gore and great acting. Love the characters and their psychoses.
B00000I8UK|5.0|No one can ever deny this amazing album's value....perfect on every level. Dolphy was such a brilliant musician, one of my inspirations, but for me (a vibes player/percussionist) my ears move rapidly to Bobby Hutcherson. An amazing record. If you don't have this---what are you waiting for????
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A page-turner from  start to finish with believable characters you root for and excellent court scenes. Should make a compelling movie.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was lost and despairing when I heard Google was retiring Reader. It still seams preposterous, but after trying Feedly, I would choose it over Reader even if it was sticking around. Feedly has more options for viewing feeds including the magazine view which showcases the beautiful photos in the blogosphere. Feedly is vibrant and colorful. They are open to changes and are welcoming to all Reader refugees. The app is fun to use with all of the sliding and tapping and it's even more colorful than the site. I'm really glad I switched,  and if you switch before Reader closes up for good, all of your feeds can be ported to Feedly. It's super simple. Make the switch!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have found all of the apps that I have purchased very useful. The ones I did not rate, I haven't used yet
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Really liked the movie until it's ending.  As my 24 year old son noted - it's like the writers of the movie put a lot of thought into writing the beginning of the movie and just didn't have the ability to have a creative ending.  Glad I only rented and didn't buy this one.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I remembered this album from my hippie days so I had to order it. The music is still the same and I like it.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|My husband and I love a good Sci-Fi.  I am Number Four is a good one!  We weren't sure what to expect because neither of us had heard of this movie.  A great movie on a rainy Sunday afternoon!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|still reading it......taking me awhile<br />I expected it to be a liesurely read but I am having a hard time wanting to finish it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|good for getting your problem solving part of the brain activated. Also nice for kids as young as four to be able to build problem solving skills.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A wondourous tale of adventure and finding the meaning of a district 12 life,mockingjay is the book you'll never want to stop reading.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone, not just the over weight.  You will be very surprised at what you learn.  It's not a diet book but a way back to better health.  Once you start to read it you will want to make the change.  Be aware, wheat is in everything but don't despair there is plenty of other foods to satisfy your hunger, tasty healthy foods.<br />This is not a pitch for Amazon to buy the book, trust me, a very good friend/nutritionist told me about the book. It's well worth the money spent.  It's your loss if you don't check it out.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I am a Trekkie from way back, and until I saw this movie, I thought that the Voyage Home was the best one of all.  I just saw this on in 3D, and can honestly say, I have never seen better visual effects, and the story line is just outstanding with lots of insights and tie ins to the Star Trek of the Older Captain Kirk.  Oh Wow, what a movie.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|They have a fun sound. I'm really enjoying it! I have it in my car and really like the whole album!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|This is not the best Jack Reacher story I have read, it's a good page turner like all of these books.  It is good to read if you have only read the later stories because it gives you a little more background on him.  I found the ending very abrupt but then of course he was just starting his journey.<br />Like all Lee Childs books worth a read.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Just a awsome movie must see it hope fully part three kicks its but we shall see oh yeah baby
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Loved the first half of the book.....then it went down from there and turned into a sappy love story with a predictable ending!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|seen this game in the casino but the setup did not have the same prizes. only money in the casinos. I have a lot of fun playing this as well, so will kids. good color too. So relax sit back and have fun you can level up pretty quick.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|\\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" manages to be several entertaining movies at once. It is first a very exciting action movie with lots of excellent special effects that should hold the viewer's interest from start to finish. Second, it is a well-done prequel to the earlier Star Trek movies and even the television series. We get to meet the crew of the Starship Enterprise before that five year mission of exploration. The actors who portray the main characters at a younger age should be instantly recognizable to generations of Star Trek fans. Third, the movie is a fairly clever remix of familiar story elements that pays homage but is not a slavish imitation of those earlier stories. The movie succeeds particularly well in exploring the interactions of the main characters, and in rebooting the most famous villain of the Star Trek series.<br /><br />The movie begins with an extended action sequence on a distant world, where Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) has once again exceeded his guidance and put his crew and ship at risk. Kirk gets out of it by violating rules and directives, and finds himself demoted, and separated from Spock (Zachary Quinto), when he returns to Earth. The actions of a vengeful Starfleet officer named John Harrison (a superb Benedict Cumberbatch) create a new crisis seemingly tailor-made for Kirk's talents. He is restored to command and sent after the bad guy, who is hiding out on the edge of the Klingon part of the galaxy.<br /><br />Harrison turns out to have a surprising agenda and equally surprising enemies; he and Kirk must be uncertain allies for a time. But the audience knows there will eventually be a confrontation, one so serious that Kirk, Spock, and the crew of Enterprise will be tested to their limits. This movie is great fun, and highly recommended.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|YOU NEED TO GET THIS APP ITS THE BEST I HAVE EVER PLAYED BUT NOT BETTER THAN CANDY CRUSH SAGA! BUT IT IS STILL A GREAT APP GET IT!
B007W4OZ76|1.0|I installed this with hopes of using my Dropbox on my kindle fire HD .  I read a lot of the reviews and thought if I followed the \\"techy\\" instructions I could figure it out. I'm NOT a whiz but I AM very computer literate and know quite a bit but I couldn't figure it out. There are NO instructions for installation or use so beware. I knew this because I did read a lot of the reviews but I thought I would figure it out.<br />I'm really disappointed. There should be some instruction for installation and use for Dropbox and because it is so difficult I give it one star.  Unless you're a computer whiz or techy geek or app whiz forget it. It will only frustrate you beyond words then you'll uninstall it. Waste of my time.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Ive found out you can trust this system of purchasing. I was skeptical about how it would work, if you get what you pay for and then if the DVD would actually play in Australia  but it did, fantastic, been wanting this for a long time and so hard to find. Thanks amazon!!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game has old school graphics but is actually quite challenging and fun. You have to pay attention and think fast.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Ive found out you can trust this system of purchasing. I was skeptical about how it would work, if you get what you pay for and then if the DVD would actually play in Australia  but it did, fantastic, been wanting this for a long time and so hard to find. Thanks amazon!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|it's one of the best television shows I've ever seen, and very good quality watching it on Amazon Instant Video.
B000PUV1ZI|1.0|All this movie is good for is to demonstrate that highly paid directors and actors will take money to walk through a project without putting forth any effort. If only there was some way to effectively boycott people who do this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm not allowed to have it on the PC so I bought it on here and now I wont stop begging my mother fir PC version. because they're both seriously awesome
B002MCJZHS|5.0|If you like the Cure or any other dream pop band, then you'll like the XX.  The combination of the reverb drenched guitars and Romy's vocals, made me put this album on continuous loop.  There are some great sounds on this album.  Highly recommended!!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I'm waisting time writing this review, because let's face it. I can't convert you into buying this, unless you already have a desire. I will say this movies is more enjoyable if you have a foundation in Star Trek history.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I didn't read the book but my niece loved both the book and the movie so I watched the movie. It was better than I expected and I would will probably watch it again. I would recommend this movie.
B0024FAG5I|4.0|I have absolutely loved this film since I first saw it in the theatre back in the day. The blu ray release is good but not great. There is some pixilation and a few dark scenes. The special features on this disk are lacking some too. With that being said it is an upgrade from the DVD version and looks way better. Also it is a great film. The 4 stars only come about from the pixilation in a few scenes and the lack of bonus content. Overall a good purchase to make though.
B00821OX98|4.0|I STARTED WATCHING THE FIRST COUPLE OF EPISODES, TO TRY IT OUT, DUE TO STEVEN SPIELBERG, BEING EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, SO AFTER DOING SO, I GUESS I GOT HOOKED, BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY CAUGHT UP WITH THE FIRST TWO SEASONS, AND WAITING FOR THE THIRD ONE TO START. SHOW KEEPS YOU GOING, ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME ACTING FROM OF THE CAST, NOT THE GREATEST, BUT I CAN OVER LOOK IT.
B00AO686MY|5.0|The remastered version of this film looks outstanding on blu ray! The content of the special features is great and there are plenty of them. There is no pixilation as far as I have seen and the colors are so bright it will almost make your eyes hurt. If you are a fan of the film I highly suggest the blu ray release!
B00015YVD6|3.0|We saw this movie when it came out originally.  I thought it may be worth another look for teenagers; wrong.  They thought it was ridiculous.  haha
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|My wife and I both remember this film from when were children and have waited a good while for it to be released onto blu ray. The transfer is phenomenal! It looks like a brand new film! If you like high def pictures with minimal distortion and pixilation this blu ray release is for you. I don't write about the story or the movie itself on blu ray reviews because its a product review not a movie review. I simply want people to know how the transfer is and if the special features are good. On this disk, they are!
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is a very listenable recording of Muddy Waters.  Every song demonstrates the pure talent and heart of the man.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I have yet to purchase a Disney or a Disney/Pixar blu ray release that has disappointed me. The clarity and colors on all of their transfers to blu ray are outstanding. With that being said this film is no exception! The colors are vibrant, there is no pixilation, the sound is phenomenal, and the disk is bursting with bonus content. A must have for any fan, child, or collector.
1878424319|5.0|This is one of those books that you can read over & over.  Also, it's one that you find yourself sharing.
B003W5C0VC|4.0|This transfer to blu ray has good bonus content on the special features but not great. There is no pixilation in the film that I have noticed but there are a few dark scenes that are a little off. The story is great as I'm sure most know but the dark scenes lower the transfer by 1 star in my opinion. I have a state of the art tv that cost around $3000 so it's not in the tv, processor, or blu ray player (which is hooked up by hdmi) it's simply the transfer. Overall it's a good blu ray only a few scenes are dark with needed clarity.
1419704400|5.0|Gave this as a gift to my daughter in the fashion business.  She loves it; the photos and content are just the right balance for dreaming.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I usually do not write reviews on blu rays since their are so many already and the movie crowd is so diverse. However if you have seen the film and liked it I will say that this blu ray transfer is awesome! It feels like you are watching it again for the first time. It has several special features that I enjoyed as well. Good job Spielburg!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Didn't find this book as interesting a read as the first one. Still going to read the next one though.
B003Y5H5F6|2.0|Usually I only write blu ray reviews based on the quality of transfer and bonus content as they are more product reviews than movie reviews. However I'm going to make an exception on this one. This film is aweful! I have all 4 of these films and the first 3 are very well done with great stories and great transfer to blu ray. This film is sub par. The story is aweful, the special effects are all cg (and not well done cg), the dark scenes (which comprise more than 1/2 of the film) are very unclear, and the writers must have ran out of good ideas because they copied the whole story off of the resident evil franchise. I would not recommend this blu ray to anyone. It is a waste of money to purchase and a waste if time to watch.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Got all my feeds imported from Google reader without any difficulty. Works great on my Kindle fire hd. I haven't had any problems with formatting or syncing. Great app
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|This movie was alright, but it was not the best movie I have ever watched maybe not worth the full rental price.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Gives us something to look forward to and keeps you interested with excitement, twists and turns. If you're a biker fan and love the life then this is the show for you.
B004SRNH10|5.0|I have not used this app very often but it did actually work for everything that I needed it for!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Couldn't put it down, except when I fell asleep or had to go to work. Ready for the next book!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have not personally tried this game, but my seven year old son absolutely loves it! It keeps him entertained and is reasonably easy enough for him to figure out. Great for waiting rooms, movie theater lines and long car rides.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I really enjoy dry English humor.<br />I do not appreciate references to homosexual behavior, however.  These poor perverted individuals should not be portrayed in movies either as heroes or villians.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is awesome for dealing with fractions! It also converts fractions into decimals very quickly. Highly recommended for folks that are getting a little rusty like me.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|The big short is, I think, better than Liar's Poker--there's a useful theme in following a set of three main people who figured out the subprime lending structure was likely to fail but they made these bets shorting the huge banks but had to ride out boyhood uncertainty and going against the industry current. Lewis isn't a scholar (and doesn't pretend for a minute to be one), but he's an entertaining writer and the book is an excellent work for the general public.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|um-num is the little monster in the game who LOVES candy. this is definetly a five star game. everyone should have it. in cut the rope experiments you get to use a lot of cool little gadgets to get candy to um-nom<br />you will fall in love with cut the rope experiments!
B007SGM084|5.0|A must read if you need a little spice in your reading material, and the story line is actually good too
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Do not order from this seller.  The case was a present and it was clearly a knockoff of a Lifeproof case.  I contacted<br />the seller and they would not even do an exchange for me.  It cracked and the camera cover on back fell off after just 2 weeks<br />being on the phone.  I bought another one a best buy just like it and WOW, what a difference between the two.  I thought I<br />was getting a bargain at 45.00 on here, but really lost 45.00. Should have just paid 80.00 at Best Buy in the beginning.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well the game is so fun but there's no Redstone dust, wolves, fish and other stuff from PC. My brother loves this game and we play together. Over all its really fun though
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game. Good graphics and very addicting! Lots of little missions too keep it interesting. This game would be for kids who can read though.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Love this cover.  Nice leather and it looks so classy.  The only thing I'd like better is if it was magnetized so that it would stay closed while in my purse.  It does sit up by itself on a table for reading, but only in landscape mode.  I'll keep it until it wears out, but I think next time, I'll get one that's magnetized and has a place for my stylus.
0061906220|5.0|I really love this story to teach colors.  Be sure and download the music that goes with it!  So cute!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|This movie had good acting and excellent special effects.  From start to finish it will keep your interest as the movie is told in a charming Southern drawl by the two main characters which makes you feel comfortable and relaxed as you watch the storyline unfold.  The depiction of South Carolina in all it's beauty, set around some of the old plantations of a by gone era, make this movie a must see.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|If you are going for cool graphics, not for you. But, if you love a game that you keep telling yourself one more time.<br />7 hrs later you decide you will stop for 10 minutes or so.<br />This is the game, play for 5 minutes or 7 hours it's fun.<br /> I highly recommend it.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The original Star Trek series has been remastered and is in HD. The video quality is amazing! Fantastic colors, and great detail. I can see things that I never noticed forty years ago on a black & white SD TV set. Almost like watching for the first time!
B000002LQR|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST RELEASES FROM THIS BAND! THEY CAN ROCK WITH THE BEST OF EM AND ARE ALWAYS FRESH AND NEW WITH EACH SONG!
0385349831|1.0|I was trying my best to give this book a fair shake despite my developing a sinking feeling about it from the third page. By page 18, I found this little gem \\"The important thing is to get back on your feet\\"...this is presented in the context of being victorious instead of defeated because as long as you can get up, you win. Not exactly untrue, but how ordinary and full of contemporarily expressed truths can an ancient manuscript be? I feel like most verbose ancients would have focused on  letting your spirit rise above your circumstances versus the focus on the physical metaphor of getting back on your feet.<br /><br />This book felt very forced in its spiritual explorations all the way through, and I can't recommend it unless you are already a dedicated fan of this author and predisposed to finding wisdom in a book that takes previously collected wisdom and repackages it in direct address format.
B0054SMID0|5.0|.  I enjoyed watching it. I liked the whole ideal of his kind of a lawyer.  It seems our judicial system sometimes fails.
B005PK57NU|5.0|really enjoy the series..well written and very well acted..found series by accident and became a fan almost instantly..different from so many of the series on television now..
1878424319|5.0|These 4 simple, yet powerful agreements help you to cut down on the stress and drama that we add to our daily lives.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Finally, I found an app that after scanning will follow along to the words to songs I've always wondered about.  Not that my husband appreciates my voice, though....lol.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I love this game! I could play it all day! This is one of my favorite games of all! There is so many things you can do!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was intriguing to read, the twists and turns made it one where you could not guess at the ending.  My personal opinion is that it was a bad ending but then I prefer to have justice and happiness.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It's Batman! Great movie. Son loved it . He has all the Batman movies. Would definitely recommend it to Batman lovers.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very well written, kept you guessing until the end.  And made you think of how would you adjust to the issues discussed if it were in your life.
0887307280|5.0|Small business advising/instructing. Great book to quote and recommend to clients. We keep one in the library all the time.
B000VI04HK|3.0|I'm disappointed that R.E.M. would even put something that is so meandering.I own several R.E.M. cd's as well as some live cd's. This by far the worst.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|I love it. I have told others about it.  The best thing about it is FREE!  Anything free is awesome.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|The Lumineers offer a fresh take on the music scene. They remind me a little bit of some early  Jayhawks music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I work at a day care, and I go to pinterest on my Kindle Fire and look for crafts ideas, it is amazing the stuff that I find. LOVE IT.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|better than I thought. needs to be more clear on objedctives and what you are up against fun but no leave and a bit repetative
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I would recommend an i7 if you are planning on ever upgrading, yet any version of the i5 will carry a medium to heavy gaming load with no problems. CPU temp stays very low, even with included stock heatsink.<br /><br />If you are on a budget, this is the best CPU to get.  Don't worry about bottlenecking your Gpu, because this chip will hold its own!
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|Movie was decent- had some funny bits, but it was billed as a comedy.  Set your expectations that this isn't a \\"normal\\" Apatow style movie and you'll be much happier.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Great' but make no mistake that this is a short story. Very enjoyable nonetheless, especially if you're into Mr. King
B00A4FOWYQ|1.0|Sullying a name these ladies spent years nurturing, this album walks away from the charm, wit, and musicality of their earlier records for a new &#34;pop&#34; aesthetic they clumsily wear like an ill-fitted suit. Exactly what not to do if you're jumping ship for the mainstream, this album can't even supply the grooves or hooks that make dumb music accessible. This album is tepid at its best, cringe-inducing at its worst. Albums like this are so embarrassing for the listener not because we, as the audience, were somehow betrayed (though we were) but because you can hear in every song that the writers betrayed themselves.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Very wordy.  No trouble putting it down and have to make myself keep going back to it and continue to read since it was so expensive to purchase.  Perhaps when I finally finish it; I will feel differently.
B00CM96A60|3.0|If you're into trance or techno and you're hankering for a fix, all you really need to do is go on pandora or some internet radio station, type in Armin Van Buuren and listen to whatever is compiled from his search and you'll never know the difference between his tracks and others, and it's kind of disappointing in my opinion. What I've loved about Ferry Corsten all throughout these years is that he has evolved and put on his cds the best sounds of electronic dance without sounding too generic or boring. His Right of way cd is one of my favorite cds of all time because with him you get a sense that he's very well rounded. Of course he has his monikers through which he has different styles, but for the most he has a good collection of different sounds. AVB just has the same old sound since I started listening to electronic music in the mid - late 90s. It's not bad... it just sounds like he's been in a cave for the past 15 years. The same synths, same beats, if there are singers then they usually have similar lyrics as old songs (like how great life is, let's enjoy this and that, etc). It's been a while since he's released a cd so I was kind of excited to hear this as I've been listening to a lot of different music in the time since then and I feel my musical sensibility has evolved. But then I heard this cd and I thought, \\"Well.... if it ain't broke don't fix it, I guess.\\"
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have never left a review of a book on here but after reading his book. I Just want to say wow!  Loved it! I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something funny and romantic wrapped up in one! I hope the author writes another book like this!
B008602KQI|5.0|My son talked me into going with him to it. It was actually required reading. After watching it, we already had the Kindle editions so I read those too. I was very pleased.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Works great, this is just what I was wanting. Love the quality and portrait position when reading. I would highly recommend.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This movie has given me hope that there are still good movies to be made. its a fresh take on a classic love story that is very relatable. The lead male character \\"R\\" played by Nicolas Hault is just about the cutest thing I have ever seen! His character is genuinely trying to understand what the world has become and himself in the process. The story is written extremely well and is not one of those predictable zombie movies, its clever, unique will make you want to laugh and cry! :) I ABSOLUTLY ADORE THIS MOVIE AND I WILL FOREVER lol im pretty sure you will like it too. its definitely worth buying to have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game because like one time we were going to drive down to new York and we had to leave at 4:00 am so I couldn't sleep so I played subway surfers and I realized it was 4:00 am and I had to fake sleep lol
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Their game is great except that it is too short. Graphics are great though and quite fun to play.  Challenging.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid and having it transport me to another place and time.  Watching now makes me wonder it ever took off... but I guess that really is the magic of the original Star Trek.  Thank you Gene!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I got this for my wife since she had read the book & was anxious to see the movie. But all I could think of beforehand was that this was sure to be just another chick flick, which is not my cup of tea. But not so; there was certainly enough action to keep me interested & the entire movie moved along at just the right pace. It never dragged & I actually stayed awake during it's entirety. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I think I actually enjoyed this remake more than the original and I was a teenager in the 80s. Great dancing and music...always a good combo. The plot line is a little trite but it still makes for an amusing movie.
B0000012XV|5.0|My new Fav! Such a talented pair! This is a beautiful recording. Warm, clear and crisp. Such a treat!!  A must have!!!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Watching this movie brought back memories of trying to get pregnant, being pregnant, bringing the baby home, and dealing with a husband who was reluctant to be a father. It definitely hit a good balanced between comedy and reality. A surprising number of laugh-out-loud moments. I was worried that it would be a bit too serious.
B0064MGU98|4.0|So far so good. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.<br /><br />I don't like having a certain amount of words we have to type for reviews.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|great movie! my daughter ask me to rent it usually not my type of movie. but this movie was really good.
B000089RV6|5.0|I forgot how much I loved this old music, so fun to dance or play the metalliphone too I just wish I had some Bose Speakers:~}
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I liked this movie but I think a lot of it was over my head.  The story was interesting and the time went quickly despite it being a long movie.  I still had some parts that were hard to follow.  I almost needed a cheat sheet to keep track of everything.  I'm glad I watched it.
B008602KQI|3.0|good action, good concept<br />poorly directed i would say<br />the acting wasnt all that either, the bad guys were especially poor<br />good ending
B007R41E8O|3.0|The story starts out great, with lots of hints of spookiness to come, but never goes anywhere.  Their escape is the only plotline not left hanging.<br />The game tossed me out to the 'ALAWAR' opening screen SIX times.  I was able go right back into the game, but I always had to redo the last action.  Really annoying. Took off a star for that.<br />If not for the hint button, I'd probably still be wandering around in the fog.  Way too much back-and-forthing for me. Took a star off for that.<br />Good ambient sounds, the music is ok but on a really short loop.<br />The HO scenes were -dare I say it- delightful.  I'm not a big fan and usually find them tedious.  Here, when in zoom, the items on the list fade out if they can't be found, and fade back in when you scroll around to where they are.  Kinda like you're getting warmer.  Liked that feature a lot.<br />Not a bad game.  I recommend, but be aware there may be a glitch or two.  Played on Kindle Fire 2nd gen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great app! I love having so many different translations available at the touch of a finger. The daily scripture is a good feature.  Bookmarking and highlighting make this a very useful app, especially for those of us who have arthritic hands!
B005H9B44A|4.0|Although the stuff on asgard was pretty boring, Thor was a fun character. Also loved him in Avengers,  (He's adopted&#34; is a great lien)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great for kids and adults. Keeps you on your toes (or fingers). Similar to Temple Run, but is a mite easier for kids.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Period peice, lots of character development, costumes and clothing are beautiful to watch. Go ahead and get lost in it!
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Series continues to be excellent in every regard - acting, characters, story, plot. I really have no downside to report - except that we have to wait for season III!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I was fascinated by the premise of this book and it did not disappoint. Why do we do the things we do? How can we change those thins in our lives we want to change? A very interesting read
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I hate to say this, because I enjoyed reading the books...this was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The adaption from the books really missed the mark, and the directing was...well let's just not go there. This one is not worth the time.
B005R32L66|4.0|It was a little hard to set up and to figure how to work but it is fun to use I like it so far
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Kept me interested the whole time. Not just some gore filled horror story. Great story and great message that makes you really think.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is great goes rightto my account and plays music from the cloud player saves the space on my tablet  Love it
B00AECGQF2|5.0|It is really fun. I really enjoy it. I play it a lot. Get it. Smiley face. Tickle tickle. Gummy bears rule
0679809015|4.0|My child loves this book, he takes it every where with him. This book is small as well could be bigger.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I love the dynamic between Ma and Jack. The story was a bit repetitive at parts but understandably so. The plot kept me in suspense! And I must say jack is adorable!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|&quot;PuddingMonster&quot; furthers ZeptoLab's reputation for producing fun, high quality, mobile games. This is not an action-puzzler like &quot;Cut The Rope&quot;, instead you'll find a straight ahead puzzle game that starts out simple but both slowly increases in difficulty and quickly increases in fun as new play field mechanics are added. In addition to the great gameplay you may find yourself unexpectedly enjoying both is unique visual style and perfectly matched soundtrack. This game is well worth the purchase price.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome. Whenever you get bored, you can just play this game. It is a great time waster. The best part is..... it's FREE!<br />I love this game. I recommend that everyone buys it.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I thought it was just another version of Angry Birds, which I love. When I realized I had to play it with others (I don't play well with others) I deleted it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I really loved the series and was looking forward to the resolution of a lot things. No resolution. Also an epilogue that made me think the writer is saying, &#34;I'm done with this one.&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What else is there to say? It's easy to use and does the job. It adds, subtracts and multiplies. Great.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Instant weather on my Kindle! Like having the convenience of not needing to use my browser. thanks, three more words.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Science fiction is by far my favorite genre, and Star Trek, while not serious fiction, is a fast, easy joy to read.<br />TNG has always been my favourite. ( That's The Next Generation, as opposed to TOS, The Original Series).<br />In TOS, only three characters really mattered, maybe five if you count Uhura and Scotty. But in TNG you have true teamwork, a mishmash of nationalities, home planets, and races, led by one man with a large conference table who listened to all suggestions before making a decision.<br />I wish I could have worked for a leader like that.<br />This book shows Picard's leadership style hasn't changed. He is barely mentioned because there are many more important characters in the story.<br />And a big hooray for the author: even if you know nothing about the Star Trek universes, he has fleshed out each person, and android, that you understand why this mission must be accomplished in the time allotted.<br />Don't expect this to be a rehashing of the television series. There are new characters, absent characters, and new relationships.<br />And don't expect the book to sugar coat everything-life doesn't. You'll find a few surprising changes; I did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I found Pinterest to be problematic when using the Fire's browser. The app works much better. I'm happy with anything that bypasses the flakey browser!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|ok so I thought this was a perfect gift for my Minecraft loving child. HOWEVER, she opened the tiny box with extra tiny lego pieces and took one look at the pieces and said thanks then she went right back to her lap top to play the &#34;real&#34; Minecraft. This may be cool for the collector of Legos but the true Minecraft fan will think its a J_O_K_E.
B00CW665VI|1.0|I have to give Emma Chase some credit: this was like no other romance I've ever read. It's told entirely from the first person POV of the male protagonist, Drew Evans, and he's talking directly to you, the reader (which was sometimes distracting). I also give Chase credit because, while Drew is a chauvinist pig most of the time, his character is believable and fully developed. Most of the other reviews are five stars, and I get that. Tangled is appealing because it's so unique. The pacing of the plot is perfect. The dialogue is fast and sharp. Kate is sassy, smart, and independent. Drew is charming and funny.<br /><br />Here's the thing, though. Sociopaths and wife beaters can also be charming and funny, yet, like Drew, they are often manipulative, misogynistic, self-centered, immature bastards. Drew is a manwhore, and women are objects for his sexual gratification. He tells us right off the bat that he generally doesn't even bother to learn their names. (\\"If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment? Don't make the mistake of thinking he's so into you, he's already thinking up pet names. It's because he can't or doesn't care to remember your actual name.\\" Location 168) His narrative is full of jawdroppingly anti-feminist and anti-gay quips (I didn't start keeping track until I was more than halfway through the book, but I highlighted at least a dozen examples of misogyny and homophobia in the last half alone.) Considering that his own promiscuity, Drew's tendency towards slut-shaming of women is stunningly hypocritical. (Example: concerned that the reader may object to his telling his buddies about a threesome he had with twins as disrespectful, he says, \\"if a chick wants me to respect her, she needs to act like someone worth respecting.\\" Location 350)  He refers to his sister as The Bitch (though she's nothing but good to him). He derisively refers to chick-flicks like The Notebook as \\"totally gay.\\" The things he says to Kate at work blatantly cross the line into sexual harassment territory, and he knows it, but doesn't worry because he's \\"99.9% sure\\" Kate won't rat him out because \\"[s]he wants to beat me. And she wants to do it all on her own.\\" (Location 795.) Drew knows he's crass, but thinks he should get away with it because, the way he sees it, he's just telling it like it is.<br /><br />Even when he falls in love with Kate and has to grovel to get her back, he's totally manipulative. They work together. Drew is the boss's son and the firm's well established Golden Boy; she is a brand new, entry level associate, an uneven power dynamic that makes his behavior all the more reprehensible. When she spurns him, he arranges a series of highly visible and disruptive stunts AT THE OFFICE to change her mind, apparently not knowing or caring that the last thing a newly-hired, professional woman trying to build a career needs is to have her personal relationships be made into a sideshow at work. Outside of romance novel fantasyland, Drew's behavior would likely get Kate fired and him slapped with a restraining order and/or a sexual harassment lawsuit. When she asks him to stop and threatens to report his behavior to the boss, he smugly reminds her that the boss (his dad) is on vacation for two weeks, another senior partner is also away, and the third is Drew's godfather and a sucker for romantic gestures. Step outside of the warm fuzzy fantasy for a minute and imagine that you are (like Kate) a professional woman trying to stop unwanted sexual advances from a work colleague: doesn't this make your skin crawl?<br /><br />Other reviews talk about how funny Drew is, but mostly it's a mean spirited humor, reminiscent of a witty high schooler shoring up his own popularity by making jokes at others' expense. Bottom line: I can see what others liked about this book, but it has way too many antifeminist/antigay issues for me to share the enthusiasm.ngs he says to Kate at work blatantly cross the line into sexual harassment territory, and he knows it, but doesn't worry because he's \\"99.9% sure\\" Kate won't rat him out because \\"[s]he wants to beat me.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a fun game for children of all ages. one of those games that's so dumb its fun. great game
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|SO WHAT.........PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT>>THIS IS A KICK A MOVIE LIKE VIN DIESEL DEALING WITH A GLOBAL TOPIC DRUG CARTELS..I GUESS NOW PEOPLE WANT THE CARTELS TO WIN..ARNOLD WILL BE BACK AGAIN
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Have heard a couple of their songs before but was recently introduced to this CD, downloaded it and really enjoy listening to it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|A friend and I have a game we play called &#34;Derivative.&#34;  We play it when watching movies that are unoriginal. That's what I thought about this final installment. Derivative of itself, adding nothing new and rehashing warmed over dialogue and descriptions, this book could have been titled &#34;Fifty Shades of Smirk.&#34; Derivative of &#34;9-1/2 Weeks&#34; and climaxing (pun intended) with a bad B-movie bad guy and stupid sidekick. Of course, we're all reading it for the sex tips, but even those scenes got tiresome. Read it to finish the trilogy, but hope that the literary gods discourage Ms. James from writing again. Definitely not looking for this on the silver screen . . . don't like theaters with sticky floors.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|For being a small budget production about a video game this was extremely well done. The acting was better than what is to be expected as well as props and effects. If you like the Halo story then you need to see this.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I love this show. Its a good show. I enjoy watching this show. I like to watch it on tv.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Enjoyable to see the early episodes. Even the ones not in color were charming. Fun to watch the characters and the production values evolve (quickly). Some of the storylines seemed ahead of their time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|With the movie being announced and coming out soon, I went ahead and reread Enders game just to familiarize myself again with the novel. It's just as fresh today as it was when it was first written. I should say it's as fresh today as it was when I first read it, and it's been over 20 years
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Even for those who never watched full series of Star Trek before. My 13 year old daughter who had never seen one before liked it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This film was a fun time but respectful of people with mental illnesses. The film makes a good point: we are all a little &#34;crazy&#34; at times. We need to have patience with one another. Cooper is such a hottie and I am a Jennifer Lawrence fan for sure now.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've watched other adaptions of this movie..I did enjoy that it was a musical..and that the actual actors chosen for this film performed the songs..good all the way through..
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was an excellent book and Ang did a great job capturing that in this film adaptation. It is clear in the movie that faith does not have to be viewed strictly on religious terms; spirituality and faith transcend any particular religion. Bonus: the CGI is amazing!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I bought the last two installments to finish my set..but either it was because I liked the younger Harry and his adventures or because the last two films seemed rushed and anti climatic..wasn't as pleased with the ending..
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|The game is so great! It's a nice little thing to pass the time! Weeeeeeeeee i wish it was longer though:(
B0060MYM3S|5.0|What is there to say..if you follow the books..you know kind of what to expect..who do you trust..no one..good storytelling..although gory.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|At first I was really confused but now I am a pro . Great game easy and simple...........and FREE . I say get. But I say you can get a choice of a girl driver too..but still awesome
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Ian McKellen  was a great little hobbit..after the Lord of The Rings though..maybe I was spoiled...I've read the books ..seen the movies..over and over never wanting them to end..it didn't quite quench the thirst.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I have never read about a more dysfunctional person ever.  I felt so sorry for her, and hoped through the whole story that she would let her life get better.  It was with great relief that at the end she finally let it happen.  It was a good story after all.  I would recommend it to my friends.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is a lot like temple run but better.this is because the game has daily missions which is pretty convenient for getting<br />Crystals.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Almost as good as the book.  Have watched it twice now.  I lent the book more emotions as I read it, and it did not elaborate on the extreme poverty and need of Katniss life, just a bit so you got a hint.  Very good movie.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love this site it is so relaxing and time consuming. I wound recommend this to any age group.Enjoy and have fun
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Such a wonderful book! I couldn't put it down! Bravo Nicholas Sparks!! Definitely recommend this to anyone. I am so glad this was my first purchase on my kindle.
0452298482|3.0|pages are imperfectly cut and hard to separate.,weird.Also no invoice included. What am I paying for this book?<br />gmrosen @idcomm.com
B0015346OM|4.0|A story that I found both fascinating and terrifying. Difficult to put down but difficult to read. It often found myself pacing while reading. A terrifying account with many tragic outcomes. A great read for those with a love of non fiction war books. Just be aware its an emotional and painful. So arm yourself accordingly with Advil,  stomach soothing tea and a place to safely pace while reading. This is an intense account about the loss of many young wonderful men and goes into great detail of how these men lived albeit briefly as the mission failed....
B00785P2QC|3.0|So far it's quite fun. I'm still trying to figure out how everything works though.  Not too happy that it makes you connect to Facebook to complete quests. Get rid of that and it'd be a 4/5 star game.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Like all the other books I've read of these authors it keeps your interest to the very end. I have enjoyed the Pendergast series very much.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|It's got no real plot and the action scenes are terrible. The only saving grace is the actors/actresses which seem to want to try and salvage a bad movie, but couldn't help it.
B002R88G5E|5.0|I've enjoyed the historic backdrop of Afghanistan told with a clever story line of the day to day hardships and life. The cultural domain of the women's lives provides a realistic and somewhat painful insight into their endowment. Painful, sad and provides one with an appreciation of the things we take for granted everyday. Highly recommended.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|I love Majong but this has know progression and you can't follow your progress.  Did not enjoy all that much!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can hardly wait for Season 3.  It is going to be considerably different without &#34;Matthew.&#34;  Hopefully, Mary's former suitor makes a return.  He wasn't well-liked, but he played his role impeccably and I liked the aloofness and arrogance he brought to the scenes.  Downton Abbey and Scandal are my favorite shows to watch.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is an entertaining game and was what I was looking for!  Could be fun for most ages!<br />I like playing this type of game that goes on!
B009NY43NY|5.0|It's unfortunate so many people bashed this book's ratings just because their preferred male wasn't the one that Sookie was paired with. Charlaine Harris did a really nice job wrapping up the series in this book. The story was fast paced and interesting, the mystery was intriguing, and many beloved characters made an appearance. This was a fun and very satisfying read.
0762445262|2.0|I did not see the size when I ordered this.  It is approximately 2 inches by 3 inches.  It is very small.  I would not recommend this if you want to project this on a wall.
B009X00E18|5.0|this is excatly what I wanted and needed as I am a truck driver and need to keep my kindle safe
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Good information.  I remember more info when in story form.  Gives me renewed hope to make changes in my life.  However now I need actual instructions to work though, like a workbook
B0090EJ99A|4.0|This movie was not what I was expecting. I enjoyed watching it and would tell my friends to watch it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie has everything you could want from a star trek film. J.J abbrams has done it again. Special effects are top notch, good story, awesome characters. I cannot wait for this movie to come out on Blu - Ray
B003QTUQGU|4.0|If you like fantasy movies this is the movie to watch!  I would rent this movie again! Enjoyable to watch!
B00B4804KS|2.0|Not sure why they called this 3D. It looked exactly the same as the regular blue ray. To me this was a waste of money.
B0094M2S5A|4.0|This is a great movie! It is a little dated but the so worth the price! I would watch again!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Now this was truly made for 3D. Loved all of the visual effects of this version. Well worth the price!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The idea of the movie was great, execution was sub-par. Had the direction, screen play, etc, been better, this could have been another Matrix, or Inception. Instead it was more like Adjustment Bureau. The lead actors did a great job from the acting standpoint; the supporting actors, probably due to bad direction rather than skill, were sub-par. Overall this should-have-been-five-star-movie gets only three stars. The shifting from scene to scene (corresponding to different sets of characters and chronology, though with the lead characters played by the same actors) was confusing and hard to follow. Just when you get attached to a character or a scene, the scene and characters change. Rather than interesting and fun, these scene changes were frustrating and distracting.<br /><br />Worth watching? Sure, if you're willing to pay close attention, deal with some bizarre and slightly violent scenes (enslaved woman killed via remote control bomb on neck [with blood shown]; child killed via bow and arrow shot [no blood]), and are okay with the maddening thought that, had execution of the movie been better, this could have been an outstanding drama rather than a mediocre one.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. The 3D effects were very good and the movie was very informational in that it gave you the events leading up to Alien.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|The action in \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" starts from the very beginning and doesn't let up. It is a better than Star Trek 2009, a movie which I also enjoyed. The only flaw I saw with \\"Into Darkness\\" was after the villain was revealed. I thought the movie was heavy handed in its parody after that point.
B002Q9MZHE|1.0|This recording has audio defects--skipping, volume variations that I could not control.  I returned the product for an exchange and the  copy was the same?  So, I gave up and threw it away.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Ok. So I had just got done reading the book and was SUPER excited to watch the movie. BUT they left out one of the scenes I was really hoping to see which was the winter formal!! UGH! Why did they have to change the ending? I tried to watch the movie as if I hadn't read the book. Im glad I read the book because if I had not read the book, I would have been totally lost! I am from South Carolina and I have read some people on here who claim they we dont talk like that and we are not southern bible thumpers haha! Well I defenitaly have a southern accent, but am no bible thumper and YES there are some of us down here who act like this. I loved the ending because I enjoy a different story from the original. I am always thinking oh what if it ended this way , and this was a good ending. But I do believe there could have been more scences added and not changed soo much. I am about to read the second book in the series am SUPER excited!!! The movie could have been better wish they would have stuck to the storyline more, but I did thouroughly enjoy it but will only give it 3 stars because it did not meet what I had pictured in my head like twilight/ hunger games....ect all the movies ive read w a book this one didnt stick to the story line...so I will suggest WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST THEN READ THE BOOK so you dont get confused like im feeling right now haha!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Bought this for the kids, they love it. I have only played it a little, but it seems fun so far. Great graphics!
B003U4UPHG|4.0|Intriguing story plot with good twists and turns that kept me guessing. You get attached to certain characters which make that show even more enjoyable.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Who ever thought that Showtime would end up commissioning what, at least to me, is pretty much the best TV show in decades ... watching Dexter is an extraordinary experience: in technical terms it is exemplary - from the music to the lighting, it's obvious the producers have put a stellar team together.<br /><br />Season 4 is my favourite season so far. I have to admit I'm slightly bemused that some viewers have been surprised by John Lithgow's performance. I know that in more recent times he's become associated with a sitcom character. However, even the most perfunctory look at his career reveals his capacity to inhabit dark characters, and in this season he really does provide the darkest of counterparts to Dexter's own dark traveller.<br /><br />And this is what, at least for me, makes season 4 stand out. The parallel families spell out in no uncertain terms what happens to a cultural dream once it becomes infected by incurable dysfunctionalism. Thus we get to witness a hilarious encounter with neighbourhood vigilanteism, itself implicitly compared to charitable acts (a subtle comparison - no sledgehammer moralising here); two different but intimately entwinned attempts to reconcile traumatic family histories with contemporary family life; a fascinating exploration of the idea of self and social control ... it is these comparisons/juxtapositions that drive the narrative. Had it been the other way around, the writers would probably have ended up with a pretty artificial, forced narrative. But because Dexter remains driven by its characters, even the most outlandish situations retain plausibility.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I did not like this movie and would not even give it a one.  Started off bad and remained bad until I turned it off partially through the movie.  The movie had inappropriate content that conflicts with true Christian values.  I strongly forewarn anyone from watching it.  I am really disappointed in Tom Hanks.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Not been moved to review before, but all the Dexter series have been excellent (my personal ranking - 5,1,4,3,2). However, whilst i agree that the season started slowly, I thought the final episode one of the finest and most moving pieces of television I have seen in a long time. I thought I was going to be disappointed when I realised Dexter was going to &#34;team up&#34; with someone else - how could that work? Work it did and how? Julia Stiles was brilliant as was Johnny Lee Miller - love the understated menace. Peter Weller was inspired casting...he does grubby like no one else. Niggles..yeah, I have some:<br />I have to agree with an earlier reviewer - when did Quinn get a part time job as a male model?<br />Would have been good to understand what pushed Quinn and Deborah together? ( male model looks I guess)<br />There's plot holes you could drive a car through, but aren't there always and we love it just the same.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|Recently saw the new movie and someone remarked that they liked this one better. Of course I had to check it out. This is a good movie but I liked the newer movie more overall. However, I like the end better in this version. I have not read the book so I have no idea which version more closely represents F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have just finished watching this season and it has been amazing, not wanting to spoil it but it moves away from the whole there is a big killer he has to take down but this story line has been so tense and exciting and I would say one of the best so far and any Dexter fan will enjoy season 7 which ends with you screaming nooooo I cannot wait till next month to find out what happens, I will be pulling my hair out till then I think!
B009O2XY12|3.0|I enjoy it, but I don't like the timer.  I don't want to pay to be able progress. I guess I'll just have to be patient and wait for the timer to expire.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Loved it, Love the blood and Loved the Story line. Just as good as the other Seasons. Would recommend to those who like a bit of blood and murder. Highly enjoyable and a great Series so far.
0345803507|4.0|I enjoyed reading the third book of the trilogy. It was entertaining. I liked the first one the best but, of course it was a trilogy so, i had to read the last book.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|The author of this book has what we call &#34;been there, done that and got the T shirt&#34;.  I was on the chain gang back in the 50's and boy this is about as real as it gets to being what it was like.  Paul Newman played the role to perfection also.Loved this movie.
B0029XFN8A|4.0|Good movie. A bit raunchy at times but funny, sweet and sexy all together. A great movie for young adolescent boys to see. It definitely explains how teenage boys feel as they are getting interested in girls and sex.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Since I had read this book so many years ago as a kid, I didn't remember it, so it was time to  do so again. I am so glad I did. I think it should be required reading in 8th grade. There are so many lessons in this story that the me me generation could benefit from, and yet it is very enjoyable.  It is a book that, at the end, you want to still know what is going to come next.
B001KZIRL8|5.0|Don't know why and can't explain exactly why this is one of my favorite movies of all time! Maybe it's because there is so much truth to the movie and the different characters convey the different situations women go through while dating or a difficult marriage. the different women that tak to the camera about their own personal situations in-between the movie scenes are hilarious and absolutely the truth! I have watched this movie about 50 times and will probably watch it another 50!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This album is wonderful. I think we've needed music like this for a long time. Daft Punk is never a disappointment.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is the original and a wonderful movie about marriage, relationships and women friends. I love it because the acting is terrific and although made over 40 years ago, and the clothing styles are different, the situations still remain the same with the dialogue.<br />The most interesting part of the movie is that not one man ever appears in the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A good game but every now and then it very minorly glitches but overall a very good game I could play This all day it's kind of like temple run but you have three lanes and have to dodge trains and get away from the police it's amazing that it's free!!!
B009MYARIK|4.0|As is Sophie Kinsella style, this book is written with humor on a subject that is not always considered humerous...being dumped!
B008K8VDPU|1.0|The description of the product did not show me what to expect.  It was not something I would us.  Maybe good for teaching someone to play music.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|memories are wonderful.  kEEP offering the oldies for discounts and we'll keep supporting the sales.  happy memorial day weekend.  peace out
B0094LZY2A|3.0|This movie wouldnt have been funny if david alan grier wasnt in it I love that man i wish he played in more movie and shows
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Wow had all 12 restraunts unlocked updated the app and now have ten. They want extra money to unlock the ones that where already locked. I unto installed. Another thing was the ads that would pop up to buy the same app I had already owned.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|VERY GOOD CONCEPT but i have seen better<br />fells like its a game that you put to the side and play a better game wile it makes the resources. so facebook games
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|It took me a bit to get into, but it made up for that in the way it hooked me later on. Looking forward to the second installment of the trilogy!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book demonstrates the power of the mind and the willingness to overcome adversity by clinging to meaningful things such as love and the beauty of nature. Food, shelter, warmth and safety become the utmost priorities as Frankl is faced with the cruelty and contempt of the Nazi regime. The essence of the meaning of life is to respect fellow humans and to share and commit to the betterment of humanity in personal relationships and the broader global community.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|A very good movie, Tom Cruse does not disappoint on action and a great story plot. We rented this on our Prime account and was well worth the price.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really comes in handy doing a bible study and really fast to find other books of the Bible, also able to look up other versions of Bibles
B005PK56TA|5.0|Was a great show, I finish watching the show on Netflix. I hope another season come out. I was hooked from the first episode.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|good game to play with your kids keeps them trying for the next power up on the car or truck keep up the great games
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|It's great for what it is, a funk album, but its not the French house music I was expecting. However, Daft Punk say they may release a remix album of their own album if that's any indication.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love this book. When I started reading, I had to share every other paragraph with my husband. Of course he had to wait until I shopped laughing. I can see why Tina Fey is who she is. If you need a bit of funny in your life, you need to read this book.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is an intense movie. I've watched it a few times and I absolutely love it. This movie is a classic; if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself a favor and watch it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book.  After seeing the first movie, I wanted to re-read before this movie comes out. I am glad I did.  A refresher is never bad.  Love Jennifer Lawrence.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This movie is action packed, almost from the very beginning. There are no &#34;cheesy&#34; fight scenes, just great martial arts. If you enjoy a good action movie, watch this film.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|This app is very useful when checking something out from my Kindle Fire.  Easier for me to use than Google.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a great fun. Really great fun for fingered make money build city. City booms with advancements. Addictions are happenings.
B004CFAWK2|4.0|Still reading, but so far am enjoying this book.  Quite a bit different from movie more interesting in some ways of course as usual the movie makers have to edit and  shorten the book form.
B00C0233A0|5.0|Perfect package with all I could need. Broken corner of the blue ray case but no biggie for me . The movie is too epic to care
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This is a great book of tragic circumstances told in a lighthearted and humorous way.  I have recommended it repeatedly.
B001L2CKFE|5.0|I always find different versions of Eric's music to be a huge compliment to his craft...<br />Keep listening to the greats!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Great visual effects. Great Dredd portrayal by Urban. Just an excellent movie. It's a shame ti's bombed at the box office. It would have been nice to see it in 3D. This will be a cult classic in a few years.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|You can't go wrong with memories like these. Mick will always be able to get anyone rocking at home or driving down the highway...
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter is the best.  Always leaving you wanting more.  Can't wait to watch the rest of the season:) YAH!! Excited!
B000IDEORY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all times! Patrick Swayze will be eternally hot with his Dirty Dancing!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed the first season but started to lose interest toward the end.  Kevin Bacon's character is not believable at times.  The acting is okay and the concept is new and we were entertained.  I just wish the good guys were a little bit smarter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The reason why this is so buggy is because this is a experiment. The tablets and smartphones don't have large enough processors for the whole game. The full PC version is like that because it has a huge processor. If your mad at Notch and all them, your wrong. If anything complain to the MAKERS OF THE DEVICE YOUR USING. They've tried to make it as 'No-Lag' and 'Working' as possible for these portable devices, but still the device creators are money eating maniacs and want people to keep buying their stuff that they rig to break within a few years. So yeah don't complain to Notch when this isn't even his fault, tell Apple, Amazon, Samsung, whomever created these devices, that they need to STOP their polluting trashy ways and give more respect to Earth and ALL of us. Now move along you've got plenty of TIME to waste on this planet. Most of you don't even  begin to know where these devices come from, and probably don't care how many lives it's ruined to get this in your home.<br /><br />  -Sincerely,<br />  Patrick V.B.<br />  An average everyday American 6th Grader.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|My daughter had pestered me for months to see this film.  Yes, it was great, but the scenes of the slave being eaten by dogs and the two men beating each other to death was just too much for me.  I was nervous and jittery for the next few hours after seeing this moving and could'n't sleep.  I can't watch horror movies either so that gives you some idea of why I only gave it 4 stars.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|Cover is very nice and works well and easily.<br />My main issue is that it stains and spots easily. There seems to be no protective coating. It does not clean easily. Wish there had been some simple cleaning instructions included. Thank you.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|But be careful what you say because Big Brother is watching (and will be, for years to come).  Even Little Old Ladies have to be careful discussing their aches and pains unless they want to read about them in their permanent medical records which are currently being compiled for all of us whether we like it or not.  I enjoy READING about what the Grand Kids are doing and try to say as little as possible about myself. Just a suggestion.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|The Drawing  Pad is really cool the stickers, the paintbrush's, the crayons. This game is awesome and it really expresses my art talent.
B00AEFXZEO|4.0|Classic movie.  Entertaining and fun.  God music and fun dance with a goo story.  I was happy to add it to my library.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love how this game takes you through all the different times in the past like the stone ages, the middle ages, etc..
B007N85POS|3.0|Good for passing the time while I'm laid up with a broken ankle.  It takes some thought to figure out each level.  Wish it didn't keep trying to seel me things.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is over all really good. The game becomes gradually harder and harder. There are a few bosses in there.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app.  Easy to review pins on the go when I'm not in front of a computer.  That's all folks.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing movie on many fronts: visual effects; engaging story; unbelievable animal behavior sequences, & simply fantastic photography. I compare it to Avatar as far as being in a class by itself. There has Never been anything on the screen quite like this movie, and once seen--never to be forgotten
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love period pieces from the BBC and this is no exception.  A great series!  Characters are well written and well acted.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|it only works online. I thought it was justa book form, and not requireing a connection online. Otherwise it is good
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This product came quickly and was shrink wrapped. No scratches and plays well. Came very fast too, I was surprised when I saw it at my door step.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Until this morning, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was always the gold standard for the entire Star Trek movie series in my humble opinion.  When I first heard that Benedict Cumberbatch was going to be in the new Star Trek movie, I thought that he did a wonderful job in Sherlock but what can he add to the Star Trek saga aside from the fact that he and Leonard Nimoy have ties to Bilbo Baggins.  Perhaps Gollum would make a surprise appearance with Bilbo and Spock will sing the Ballad of Bilbo Baggins.  So I was very hesitant when I went to see this movie and boy....I was so very wrong!!  Star Trek Into Darkness is now the new gold standard for the entire Star Trek series.<br /><br />The story was fast paced and kept the audiences attention in our theater.  My wife, who has absolutely no knowledge about Star Trek, really enjoyed watching the movie so much so that she wants to see the prior Star Trek movie.  As for me, I thought the movie excelled because of Benedict Cumberbatch as \\"John Harrison\\".  In several scenes, you could actually hear people gasping at what Mr. Cumberbatch was doing on the screen.  He would suddenly appear or do something so shocking that you would be jumping out of your seat.  In the end, you could actually believe that he is a superior being capable of outwitting the entire Federation.  His performance alone was well worth the price of a ticket.<br /><br />Also it was great to see Peter Weller back on the screen again.  I hope he will do more movies in the future and step away from academia for a bit.<br /><br />By the time the movie was finished, people were actually giving the movie a standing ovation.  JJ Abrams has outdone himself in re-making the new Star Trek series and is truly the heir apparent of Nicholas Meyer in the action/suspense department.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show.  I did not think of British nobility in such positive light.  Sure... They are not all Saints.. But they at times display remarkable character and sensibility.  The politics of the mansion are entertaining.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great story line and believable characters. Can't wait to watch the next season starting on June 9. The final episode was a cliff hanger!
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|The best of the Star Treks! While each has its own flavor - I like this better than the others - and I grew up with the original.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is entertaining and the characters are well-enough developed, if in some cases a bit shallow.  If it has a short-coming for me, it's that there are too few characters who come into play with regularity.  There's an entire rarely-seen world of senior partners who don't seem to care a whit about how the way the managing partner and a couple of rogues risk the firm's resources over and over again.  I am a lawyer, and I (willingly) suspend my belief to watch this, since law firms don't operate this way at all.  People are human, and given the compensation system at most firms is somewhat competitive, there will be some competition.  But in the firms I'm well-acquainted with, the level of vitriol and underhanded subterfuge would cause the firm to implode almost immediately.  Good will, camaraderie, shared learning and success stories, make law firms more like a fraternity.  But as I said, it's entertaining and a mindless distraction from stuff I'd rather not be doing.
0062059963|4.0|I'm actually a little embarrassed by how much I liked the first book in The Selection series, because I loathe the entire concept of The Bachelor (and THE SELECTION was described as The Bachelor meets The Hunger Games). I gave it a shot based on a few reviewers who likewise were surprised by how fun the debut was, and honestly, I couldn't put it down once I started and I had a similar experience reading THE ELITE.<br /><br />My hatred for The Bachelor still remains, but the whole concept of girls competing for one guy actually translates to a much more tolerable situation in this series (plus it actually reminded me more of the book of Esther from the Bible). Because The Selection is a traditional practice designed to elevate a `commoner' to royal status and in a sense offer the people a sense of inclusion in the government, the whole concept takes on a different light.<br /><br />But really, it's the relationship between America and Prince Maxon that continues to keep me riveted. There are so many obstacles between them (and I'm not even talking about the other girls), and not one feels contrived. The friendship-turned-something-more is full of agonizing betrayal, juicy secrets, and heartbreaking sacrifices. We learn so much more about Maxon this time too. His crown isn't quite as untarnished as we thought, but neither is America's-regardless of her justifications.<br /><br />And Ilea itself is so fascinating since it has its roots in the USA that we all know. I loved digging more into the radical transformation that created the world that America and Prince Maxon live in. From the origin of the caste system, the first King, the rebels, and so much more. The balance between the romantic developments, character growth, and worldbuilding was so well done. I'll be be anxiously looking forward to the final book in The Selection series, THE ONE, when it's published on May 6, 2014. It's really too bad the the TV show didn't get picked up. I would have loved to watch this story almost as much as I loved reading it.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissing, mild sensualitystory almost as much as I loved reading it.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissing, mild sensuality
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I'm a big Bones fan and it took a while to get use to this different &#34;Bones.&#34; Loved to see where the stories originated from.
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoyed the whole season! It kept my interest. It's a little cheesy, but well worth watching, compared to other shows in the same genre. I looked forward to the next season. Also, being Amazon Prime makes it easy to enjoy whenever.
B006M4F67A|3.0|These games need to come with directions that an old lady can understand. We haven't played any of the games we downloaded because we don't understand how.
0374533555|5.0|This is the golden age of brain research and Kahneman is at the forefront of understanding how the brain works in vivo, in the wild, as it were.  A deft popularization of a lifetime of academic research.  It will change how you think, and how you understand your own thinking.
B004G0DN7W|4.0|My husband wanted to watch this movie and I don't really go in for westerns very much, so I didn't have much hope for it. Surprisingly it wasn't a western, it was a theme park with robots! It turned out to be a movie I would watch again and really enjoyed it!
B000002KB8|5.0|I now feel privileged to have been a kid when this stuff came out...  I made good use of my study hall time by going to the library and checking out one of the record players available... Finding a cozy corner and firing up my Black Sabbath...  I had this album and Volume 4......  Wow! That says it all.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|This could have been a great movie and I mean really stood out there, but the graphic violence really put me off. I'm talking graphic. If you like that kind of thing, this is your movie. I like a little left to the imagination. The acting was great and the story line not bad, just don't need to see so much blood and guts.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories--book, play, musical, movie--it doesn't matter. The actors are great. While some, like Russell Crowe seem a bit weak to begin with it is important to recognize they are singing live--not a soundtrack over ride.  Upon subsequent viewing his performance along with all the others get even better.  If you love this time period and Victor Hugo's novel you will not be disappointed.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|This is one wierd movie! I started watching it and it just kept getting stranger. I think if you do drugs, you might understand it better. But every time I decided to stop it something would happen and I'd have to keep watching. It really gives you alot to think about.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Lose yourself in the fantasy of this series. Acting is great and the story line does not disappoint. As long as the series in on I will buy it!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I guess you could spend more money and buy a really fancy case, but this works great and I love the way it puts my Kindle to sleep when I close the case and wakes it up when I open it.  I love the way it lets me stand my Kindle up when I watch a movie.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Saw this in the theater and preordered immediately. Great story, excellent acting. Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones are all excellent in this. It is important to tell the story and Spielberg does it right.
B006G7R25W|4.0|Another movie my husband wanted and I thought ho! hum! It was really very good! He is full of surprises when it comes to things like this. I would actually watch it again!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app. I really like the keyboard a bunch. It is the best. I like all the features
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Did not expect this movie to be so good. It's the kind of movie I would watch again. Matt was great in this one!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great show, such a shame it was cancelled. Make sure you watch the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; once you are done with the series.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I used some free office software and a different note taker before. This seems to be the least cumbersome. I liked the free version so much, that I paid the 99 cents for the full, to help the developer and not have to look at the not too bad adds. I forgot the password one time and had to re-install, but that was not bad either...
B00CW665VI|4.0|What an enjoyable story filled with laughter and a man's POV which surprised me.  I can't tell you how many laugh out loud moments I had reading this book. Two thumbs up to Emma Chase for writing this in Drew' s POV.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series really sucks you in and keeps you wanting more! I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a good romance novel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun!! I lose track of time when I am playing it! I would recommend this game to anyone that is interested.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is like temple run .but the graphics are better and there are daily missions. but the thing I hate the most about it is that you waste xp or diamonds to unlock a suit and then you have to pay stark credits.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Both leads are evil yet you root for them. The ending is reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby's ending. There is evil, or the devil, if you prefer, in the world, and some people like it. The style is cool, mixing the past, in her diary, with his straight 1st person narrative. I feel if I say anything about the polt, it'd be too much.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|It's all the rage to chuck and not hang on to stuff. This book's good for inspiration if you're the average clutter-bug but you don't have to go as far as the author does. There is a kind of crazy purity to it. Made me feel like, hell,, maybe I like a bit of clutter here and there!!! It's all about balance. That said, it is inspiration for a clean out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I don't sleep well and I can't concentrate on a book but I can play Solitaire until I feel like I can sleep.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I really wanted to read this book as I the idea if hiking such a long solo hike was very intriguing . The author continually disappointed me with her lack of maturity and often complete utter stupidity as she discussed her black lace panties instead of the beauty, solitude etc of the trail.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Awesome book.  Extremely motivational.  Makes me want to just head out and run.  This is one story that I just couldn't stop reading.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|I tried his app tried to fill the gap of Google reader but they still have a lot to do.
B006BQM762|5.0|Our whole family really enjoyed this movie. It had action, suspense & comedy which was great for our kids! Would definitely watch this movie again.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Chevy Chase's dried humor is missed in the movies today. Funny movie you can watch any season of the year.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|Why Do You Have Iron Doors If You Don't Have Buttons? Please Fix That And Why Do Iron Doors Have Wires At The Bottom Please Fix And Add Buckets And Cake And Spawn Eggs. Otherwise Its Great!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Suzanne Collins develops a very interesting world with very layered characters. It's a shame the movie fails to fully show the depth of the characters. Although grim, it is wonderful and thought provoking.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the game and my wife loves it. Now she can enjoy it when we travel on the Kindle. It passes the time so fast when you're<br />playing it a drive trip seems to melt away.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app for phones and tablets. It allow local file handling as well as connecting to any of your wireless network shared computer drives. Easy to learn interface with very good Integration with media players and other file specific apps.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely excellent show. Fairly well developed characters, and very entertaining!<br /><br />There is an 18 word min...Eighteen different words or more.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This app is great for reading and annotating PDFs but recently the facility to upload annotated PDFs to my dropbox has stopped working. This is incredibly frustrating and basically makes the app useless. If you just want it for reading then I recommend but if you actually want to interact with the document and return it to your computer then I would no longer recommend. (I used to love this app, but now it just frustrates me)
B001MEJY8W|5.0|All I'm going to say is WHAT A FILM, go out and buy it you won't be let down. Brutal, Unsettling, Disturbing and sad.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|What would you do if everyday felt like your first day of life - no previous memories, meeting people you've supposedly known as if it's the first meeting?  Who would you trust?  Surely, you can't trust yourself.  That is what this story is about and it's a wonderful read.  I highly recommend it.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app, nice navigation. Almost all the functions from Amazon's website. I was able to complete a purchase from my cell phone without any inconvenient
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its is awesome and amazing. Everybody should play I personally recommend this game to anyone who like fast moving games
B009R659L8|3.0|A long time fan of Mary Higgins Clark, I never miss an opportunity to read one of her new books. However this one was not so great. I pretty much knew the ending before I was even half-way in to it. Not her best effort.
B007KQ6XYY|2.0|WTF I got this game because I like ''cut the rope'' but when I open the game it freezes. P.S somebody please tell the creator to fix this game.But once again WTF.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Wish it was longer. It was a great game though. I had a lot of fun playing it. I spent about two weeks on it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a story about the evolving relationship between a man and a woman who both suffer from psychiatric illness.<br />It is extremely well written and themes of loss, family dysfunction and hope for the future are all explored.<br />It is suitable reading for older teenagers (17 and up) and adults. It's touching, poignant and humorous at times. A real page turner, I  couldn't put it down.  I was sorry when it ended.  Enjoy!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Like Jake/George, constant reader is also sad to leave....<br />But unlike the character, King offers me more rabbit holes to explore.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It kept me turning and flipping pages through the night. Don't read the end before you finish the book. It will spoil the surprise for you!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Beautiful plot , great actors. The scenes and clothing are amazing, could not stop watching it. Enjoyed every minute of it!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Read all the comics as a kid...nice rendition on the screen.  A lot of action!  It was very nicely put together.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|I rate this as one of the best movies I have seen. It is about a musician who did not know he was famous on the other end of the world. I laughed and cried. Loved it!!
B002XBVQKW|5.0|One of my all time favorites with a great cast.  All of these actors went on to have great careers...many were famous ahead of the movie too...lol!
B0097K21YW|4.0|easy to pick up and put down. I just wish that the scoring made more sense. All said and done worth it if you have some time to burn
B003CN5B6K|3.0|I love the series. It is engaging and a lot of fun. However, the blu-ray edition and my Sony blu-ray player do not get along. I suspect the player is the problem and not this set. Every time I start up the disc, it resets as if I had just placed it into the player and I have to go through all the front matter again. It is irritating because if the blu-ray player is on pause and shuts down for lack of activity, it resets the disc and we have to start over.<br /><br />Aside from that little problem, this is one great series, solving a new case each episode, and yet having an on-going story in the background. All of the performers are top-notch and the stories are all over the map, presenting a new look each story at some form of crime (white color or otherwise). The performances and story excellence carry forward into the following seasons and we are looking forward to the release of the fourth season.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I loved this movie as it was action right from the start. It was fast, heart pounding with unbelievable stunts and they were there through the whole  movie. I have a hard time trying to figure out stories but with James Bond movies it is always get the bad guys in any way shape or form and by whatever means. He did it here! You will love this movie if you love the series. (Also Adele sings the song and does a wonderful job!).
B001YV504U|5.0|This is one of our favorite films and to find a decent copy on Blue Ray at a reasonable price was frosting on the cake. I can't say enough about this gentle &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; story that offers a unique look into the American psyche and its love of baseball.
B00B2166BS|5.0|charges my nexus alot faster than the stock charger and with having the magnet you don't need to worry about wearing out the charger port.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|The movie took a complete turn. Kept me on the edge of my seat the complete movie. Excellent  plot and full of action. Makes you think twice about traveling to another country. Very realistic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It offers 505 versions in 285 languages. It's super easy to switch translations to compare. It's also simple to navigate to a specific book, chapter, or verse. It also offers tons of different bible plans and help you stay on track. Offering email reminders. The plans can be as long as a few days to a year. You can share, highlight, make notes and easily view the notes and highlights you've made. It's as simple as you want it or as complex as you need it.
B00742BVW8|4.0|HAS AN EXCELLENT PLOT. KEPT INTEREST THROUGH COMPLETE MOVIE. BEAUTIFUL SCENERY AND GREAT ACTION MOVES. WOULD NOT MIND LOOKING AT AGAIN AND AGAIN.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Season 3 is not as good as seasons 1 and 2 in my opinion but still definitely a must see.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|THIS WAS VERY ENTERTAINING AND FUNNY. ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. I LOVE BARBARA AND SHE HELD HER CHARACTER EXCELLENTLY. A MOVIE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
B007BVT5N4|1.0|I don`t like it because I hate Justin  write a book about Justin Timberlake. Pot smokers are just a disaster waiting to happen
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not real sure it had a plot besides sex but feel I am now getting somewhere and anxious to see what happens now she left him
B006M4F67A|5.0|One of my favorite games on my tablet.  Would recommend for every puzzle-person.  Enjoy the various lay-outs and challenges.  Excellent
B004I744AS|5.0|This is just what I was looking for. I like that it has the word of the day feature. Great app.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This twist on the popular Bad Birds series gives the power to the underdog, well the under-pig. The game is challenging, with some opportunities for even the worst player to succeed and lots of chances for those who are more skilled to show their expertise. Fun! Addictive!
0307944689|5.0|helps a lot!  Gets you prepared for the type of test it is. We had a high school student from China and she used this with some individual English help from a retired teacher and moved from an 89 all the way to 95!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I never use this.  I'd prefer to read my Facebook information on my computer.  The only reason I have Facebook at all is to keep up with my granddaughters who live up in another town.
B009R659L8|1.0|This was not her best work... it is boring.  I don't really care about the characters so it really doesn't matter how the book progresses.  I feel like this was just a book she wrote to keep her publicist happy but not one written as though she had a story to tell.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I seldom use this one.  The novelty wore off pretty fast  I primarily got it for my granddaughters to use.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved the story, even thought some parts sucked, was a great ending. I recommend it to anyone into the Stackhouse series.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My granddaughters chose this one.  I never play it myself.  I'm not good enough!  That's all I have to say.
B000QUUD60|4.0|It is good to see concert footage and songs they usually skip in other DVD's.  I enjoyed it- I don't know if getting the 2 disc special edition is worth it for a casual fan of his.  I am a big fan so I got the 2 disc edition.  They are both the same - just the 2nd one is better quality and has some bonus features.  I am glad to add it to my collection for sure.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was cleverly filmed and of course the story is compelling. I will very likely take the time to watch it again.
B009OYTAL8|3.0|I watched the first two episodes, hoping to find the witty wisecracking Oliver queen from the comics. instead I got green batman wannabe with a bow.<br /><br />I was looking for fun action and got serious business. I got very bored with it.<br /><br />if you're looking for anything close to resembling Oliver queen, this is not it.
B008Y79IUE|2.0|but couldn't get into the movie at all.  One review labelled itAS &#34;art&#34; - perhaps it is, but I was looking for entertainment.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I loved the whole season. It was one of the best final episodes of Supernatural. The last episode was the best.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does the job.  Huge on a tablet.  Easy on old, tired eyes.  No instructions needed is you have ever used a hand held calculator!
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Not as good as the other movies. Not what I expected. It is more about the son than the father.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Good interface and pretty good ... so far at catching (and linking) my thinking and notes wherever and whenever I leave them. More later.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Creative and intriguing throughout. KEPT the attention of all ages! Look forward to more game, especially for the Kindle fire.
B003VW8GT6|5.0|Great direction by the legendary Howard Hawks and a fine cast provides an exciting example of the western gerne at its best.  Good performances by new comer Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin and, of course, the &#34;Duke.&#34;  Walter Brennan is outstanding as &#34;Stumpy&#34; with great music by Dimitri Tiomkin and the hauntingly beautiful &#34;Degüello.&#34;
B00080ZG10|4.0|Growing up in Los Angeles during the later era of Howard Hughes life I have always found him a fascinating persona. DiCaprio's portraial of this man as he begins to slip into insanity was very good. It represents only a small part of Hughes life, so I was kept waiting for other things I knew happened to show up. The movie was very slow in the beginning and tried to put too much of a broad life into a short story, but overall it was a good watch.
B001NA6096|5.0|Tender, sweet and so realistic!  I loved the performances, the setting, of course.  The dialog was truly impressive.  I will recommend this realistic love story to others.
B00632HWOG|5.0|great apps for a quick trip to check the mailbox, etc.  instead of trodding through a series of whatevers, this brings you right to the source.  may not be for everyone but if you have an email address with yahoo and want to do a 'lick-a-dee split' access to check your mail, then this is it.  well worth the cost, which is zero, nothing, nil and that can't be bad.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Excellent recording of the play from the London location.  The price was very good for this DVD and would purchase others of this caliber.
