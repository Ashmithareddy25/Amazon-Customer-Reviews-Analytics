B005MMYCY6|5.0|the movie was so good every time iwatch it im sad and then happy then sad then happy its odd but in a good way
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Product arrived right away. This is the best priced combo Blu-ray/DVD/Digital copy I''ve ever seen, and it comes with the extra feature of online viewing too. I wish all movie combos are released this way.
B008KE3960|5.0|If there's another TD title this original, I'm sorry I've missed it.  5 stars only because it won't let me rate it higher. So far, I haven't felt hindered by the fact that I haven't made any in app purchases.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie is absoulutly incredible, ridiculius movie going experience and getting the 3d blu ray 4 pack for $25 is great! Best buy it cost $40. Ull think about this movie for days after uve watched it
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Having purchased their first two albums, I had high expectations for this album. While there was less songs on the album compared to the first two, the song choice was brilliant and the singing fantastic, as usual.
B009G78EE2|5.0|When I first heard \\"Wings\\" I was a little bit cynical about it -- it seemed so sincere I couldn't really get into it. But the more I heard of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, the more I thought that they were the real deal. And when they released the video for \\"Thrift Shop\\" I realized they were not only sincere, conscious dudes, they were also an insane party machine. I think I've watched that video about 100 times. And this album is every bit as good. Literally from start to finish this is an amazing sounding record with genuinely infectious hooks, and Macklemore is everything I want from an M.C. I urge you to buy the explicit version, though, because as Macklemore says in \\"Thrift Shop\\": \\"This is f***ing awesome!\\"* And it wouldn't sound the same any other way.<br /><br />*Amazon rejected my original draft of this review because I told you what the word before \\"awesome\\" was.  I'm pretty sure you can guess.  And this only serves to reinforce my opinion that you HAVE to buy the explicit version, even though the Amazon description of the edited version doesn't indicate that it's been edited.
B008NB0SQO|3.0|The picture is great. The sound is great. If you were hoping to get the full movie with the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" to bad Disney did not include it. It is not even included in the extras of deleted Scenes of which there are none. My guess is they might release an extended cut later so they can double dip. For now I will have to watch my Lazer Disc to see the whole movie. If I had known this was going to be edited I would not have bought it. My recommendation is to just buy an old DVD of the movie, it includes the song in the pan & scan version.
B0044RFT8S|3.0|The first one is not as good as the 2nd and 3rd movie but still good to watch with the family.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series I can not wait until the 3rd book comes out!! If you like 50 shades you will really enjoys this series!!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|this had to be the worst book I have read it 20 years! This lady needs to stick to Harry Potter.  Extremely depressing read with no let up all through the book.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book instilled numerous emotions in me. There was everything a book should have, that is suspense, romance, unexpected twists and turns and a wonderful ending that leaves you wanting to read more. All in all, the book was amazing as the entire sequel was thrilling, keep it up Rick Riordan!<br />[[ASIN:1423140605 The Mark of Athena (Heroes of Olympus, Book 3)]]
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|I finally went back and watched the pilot- it was very funny and sweet.  Funny to go back and see where the series started!
B00979CS50|5.0|I would assume that most NY&CH fans already possess this 2 CD set. Occasional fans may be holding off, wondering if this release fits in the bin of essential Neil Young recordings.<br />Yes, it does.<br />Before Neil sings the lyrics in \\"Driftin' Back\\" that make it plain, Psychedelic Pill had me thinking of the similarities between this artist and Pablo Picasso. Both are masters of an art form of which they are the central figure, each primitive in their approach. Both have had an extraordinary impact on scores of artists who followed. And both have created many influential works that much of the population doesn't necessarily embrace. If Neil had not already used the title Ragged Glory on a previous release, it would perfectly fit this work.<br />I have found Psychedelic Pill alternately indulgent, inspired and irresistible, many times within the same verse or section of improvisation. Both the lyrics and the musicianship could occasionally be mistaken as the efforts of a beginner; for an artist in his sixth decade of recorded output to accomplish this effect is remarkable. Some of the music skates right on the edge between childish and childlike, but out of this effort springs some transcendent music. We are listening to a master, alternately channeling the sensibilities of a savant and a shaman. The repetitive aspects, the raw primalism, the intractability of vision is entrancing but may not sit well with everyone.<br />Then one hears \\"For the Love of Man\\"; a heartbreaking, beautiful song, one that exposes the very depths of love, sadness and acceptance. By itself, reason enough for any Neil Young fan to add Psychedelic Pill to one's collection.<br />Great Crazy Horse music. Monumental Neil Young.
B004VN39YG|4.0|I thought this movie was well done.  For someone who isn't into country music like myself, it was actually kind of refreshing.  Paltrow sings all the songs herself.  The new TV series Nashville has a real similar story line for anyone who wants more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|please make this the free app of the day someday.<br /><br />I have minecraft for Xhosa and Pc AND on my iphone. I want it on my kindle as well though.<br /><br />al free app of the day porfavor?  (please)
B006Z476J8|5.0|Fantastic and Iconic record that capture Small Faces in their best form! Maybe their best record ever!!!! You must have it!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a really fun game.  I have already played several levels in no time at all it was so much fun to play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has its obvious moments of repition, but that never takes away from the story. The sex scenes are intense and amazing and the story captures you. It's a page turner and an amazing reading.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like hidden object games.  This one adds a challenge with the time limits.  I like to be challenged. The fact that each time you play the objects are hidden in different places really keeps me coming back.  The most addicting factor for me is the challenge to get enough point to get to the next level and open up some of the other rooms.
0060558121|4.0|The book is in a good state as promissed. Did not read the book yet, but have good expectations about the contend also!
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|If you enjoy the sound of the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead you will love Chris Robinson Brotherhood, fresh, simple and soul touching... Thank you guys, keep the good work and spirit high. Looking forward to seeing you guys on Friday, November 9th at the Fillmore in NYC.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|The movie as great! Wonderful SciFi with many well done graphics and scenery. Love the characters and the \\"Big Brother\\" government.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I Rember  watching it on the big screen and at the end everyone stood up and applauded at the end of the movie it was just as good the second time around, disk and box was in great shape delivery was great Thank You.
1476715904|5.0|I have never written a review on a book until now, and like the title, words can not describe how much love I have for this book. I laughed alot, and then I cried alot, and I loved the poetry.... alot. The characters are amazing. I found myself thrown into their lives and loving every minute of it. Lakens character is so headstrong at times and then you see her fragile side that screams to be taken care of. Will is the guy every woman on the planet hopes to find and spend the rest of their lives deleriously happy with. Slammed is a book you will never forget and want to read over and over.
B001C08RHA|4.0|This movie is so amazing that it kick started the entire marvel franchise and lead to some of the greatest movies ever and still more to come
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I really think the 3 books could have been down sized into 2 books.  Got a little boring after a while
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I grew up on this film and purchased it so my daughter could enjoy it too.  After 20 years it still makes me laugh and sing out loud! A family favorite through the ages.
B00447G2MK|5.0|easily one of my favorite cds in the last 5 years. A great mix of vocals and heavy screaming. been wanting to see them live, but never in the same place i am. ADTR is going in the right steps to becoming a house hold name, no they arent &#34;sell outs.&#34; they are just maturing and become sucessful which is half of the battle in the music industry. I cant wait for their next cd, i can only hope for continous great things!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great book doesn't miss a step from where the first left off. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite book series.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like the product.  It was easy to learn.  It challenges your mind differently than regular solitare.  It is fun. I believe it helps to keep your brain learning and releaves stress.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  Work great on my kindle fire. I use this app for everything since I always have my kindle fire with me. It is very convenient.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love it!  Its perfect for the Kindle Fire.  It's strong and light weight and protects my Kindle.  Fits in my bag and I can take with me anywhere I go.
1423140605|5.0|I like his books and so does my grandson. I read them and pass them on to him, then we have something to talk about. He is 14, so getting him away from video games to read is a chore.
B000002L68|5.0|A flawless album! Every song is a gem, should be part of anybody's collection. Whether you're a huge Prince fan or just a casual listener you need to have this. Heck, if you like music at all you need it.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Definitely a brain teaser. Budding engineers out there will find it addicting and a challenge. If you're mechanically inclined you should enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If your a John Grisham fan, you'll love this book. Mr. Grisham's writing makes one feel as if he is there telling you a story for which you see and feel the events.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Ms Cornwell's BONE BED has extraordinary descriptive narrative of forensic science at its best. I read it on my kindle in one night and must say it was a page turner with many twist and turns. I am not a Murder Mystery fan and rarely read them, however the science of this one attracted my attention. The villain appeared to me to be not quite smart enough, or had enough motive, or had the access to bring about this incredible complicated murder. Ms. Cornwell stated in her TV interview that she never makes an outline or knew what her characters would be like until she found them on her pages or who the villain would turn out to be. Perhaps she should rethink that.
B0086700CM|1.0|if you buy this game you will see why and trust me I know. It gets really boring after a while but it's fun when you buy everything. But after you all of thy junk it's. boringggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I lost a dear young person recently due to a brain injury and it was difficult to watch her in the hospital fighting for life and wondering if she knew how much she was loved - sadly she did not have the same outcome as Dr Alexander and life support was removed within a week of the injury and she passed away.  I read the book seeking answers and found it to be uplifting and comforting knowing that she \\"traveled\\" to a better place and is happy and waiting for those she loved and left behind.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|When I got the free version for Dr. Landau I absolutley loved it.  I just had to get the full version and I still absolutley love it! HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Easy to use, would be nicer if you could see the picture taken away from you. I think it is a very good app.And is very usefull. Take good pictures .<br />One thing happened I didn't like was I was showing a friend some of the many things that was available. I was showing him the AUDIBLE BOOKS  . Some how don't know what I did ,but when I check my main screen there was a book that I sure did not now how it got ordered. Nothing came up to say, are you sure, or thank you for your order So you can be sure I will not be going back to the AUDIBLE BOOKS very soon .
B009NCM248|5.0|Stone Sour once again delivers a solid album. There isn't a song on it I don't like. I'm not sure what else to say besides I love it, it is fantastic, awesome and stellar.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille has done it again.  A truly great story filled with insight on the state of the Middle East and our involvement. Could not put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This a great little app to have on hand. I use almost daily especialy since I lost my pocket calculator.
1607066017|4.0|I read this series as each issue came out. When I saw Image Comics had the trade paperback compilation of all the released issues, I had to get it and review it.<br /><br />One of my favorite graphic novel series, in which I even own all ten volumes, is Y:The Last Man by Brian K. Vaughn. He write really well with characters over a long period of time. Some series lack as it continues, but Vaughn has an excellent way of never losing the reader's interest. This series definitely has that potential.<br /><br />At the start, you are thrust into this completely captivating world. There are feuding planets, winged aliens, horned aliens, and robot people. And that is just to start. Later we met bounty hunters with large feline companions and another that resembles a giant spider. A ghost even joined the cast!<br /><br />The world is so rich and I really hope this series continues for a long time. Each story is told from the two main characters' daughter's future self. She is only just born in the story. Her parents are from the feuding sides of the war. Her mother has wings, while her father has horns. She has both.<br /><br />Vaughn and Staples bring up issues of family, asking what exactly makes a family? Is love enough for this family to get by on? Can they raise a child while they are being hunted down by both sides of a war?<br /><br />If you are a fan of sci-fi epics like Star Wars, Firefly, or Battlestar Galactica you will enjoy this series!<br /><br />I can't wait to pick up new issues! I give this first volume a 4/5. I hesitated to give it a 5 because I know further issues will draw me in to the story even more now that I know the characters. I hope this is only the start of an awesome series!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed parts of the books but found a lot of it farfetched.  I think the author did a good job of writing and did an especially good job of getting into the mind of a man and how he might think.  It has to be difficult to tell a story from the opposite sex's point of view.  However, after a good start I found it lacking near the end and didn't have an overall satisfaction from having read the book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|why do people complain over free stuff? when the ads pop up I say thank you and skip by it..ITS FREE!!!!!
B008ELUEQC|1.0|What is the point of this album?<br /><br />It has already been done a countless number of times by better crooners than tired old Rod.
B009ESIGHI|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite holiday films. Not only do I love the muppets, but on top of this the story, music, humor and all-in-all muppet fun is so infectious that I come back year after year wanting to see this again and again. Even right now I am singing It Feels Like Christmas in my head and I know that now it will be there all day. If you have never seen this or shared this with your family you must as it is a family classic of the highest order and one film that all should watch and enjoy!
B002SKZBQS|2.0|I am a huge fan and I have say this is one of my least liked books. I would not recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome! Great book! I love Gideon and Eva! Two very strong people that have amazing chemistry! I can't wait till May!!!!
B009AY04A8|2.0|I like hidden object games but this one is definitely NOT worth $3.  The game is pretty generic as far as hidden object games go.  The graphics are fine, the story is fine &amp; the objects aren't too hard to find, but it's more like a .99 game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you are a John Grisham fan like I am, then The Racketeer will remind you of the twists and turns of The Firm, with its own strong main character who is finding his justice and running for his life.  You will not realize the link that is woven between all the characters until near the end of the novel, leaving the reader with a page-turner that you can't put down.  Enjoy Grisham's storytelling, because he is at his best with this one.
B009Y2KGSQ|2.0|I really hate to be negative, I don't like it all. I was hoping that with Jack back in the driver seat we would get a ten song kick ass album;it turns out that I was dead wrong.<br />There are too many song for one and once again to many ballads and I have to ask why? I just don't understand it. Aerosmith stated once again that this would be somewhere between Toys and Rocks, not a repeat of the 90's and new millenium which is exactly what it is. There are a few good songs and way too much filler.<br /><br />This was my last hope for Aerosmith and it crash landed.
B006S009IY|5.0|A good clean movie. Had a bit of all emotions, laughter, sadness, love, etc. Ending wasn't what I would have liked, but still a good movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I loved it.  I can't wait for the next one to be released.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have a kindle fire, it downloaded with no problem.  The only problem I can see is that I will never get anything done.  Love this game worth the money.
B009439HEY|4.0|Generally, I've grown pretty tired of all the remastering, re-imagining, re-recording and rejiggering of classic albums and artists these days. But I figured two things with this second set of Hackett re-visits: 1) in a world of Nicki Minaj and American Idol crap, we'll probably never see music this good created again, and 2) if you're the artist who (co-)composed the material, you get a pass when you do a deja-vu on it. However, I think this one could have been pared down to one great album because half of the songs are pretty much note-for-note recreations with little variance, while others offer something that the original didn't: a female vocal for \\"Ripples\\", a longer acoustic guitar intro for \\"Blood on the rooftops\\", a sweet Steven Wilson vocal take on \\"Can Utility\\" for instance. Otherwise, I didn't feel a need for an exact reproduction of \\"Entangled\\", or \\"Afterglow\\" (other than John Wetton's nice vocal), and something as epic (and long) as \\"Supper's Ready\\" is really better left to the originators. Still, throughout this 2-disc set, which also includes several Hackett solo pieces, the varying band members all perform with great dexterity on these usually-difficult compositions, and the vocalists don't make you scream out \\"Where's Phil/Peter??\\" (additional singers here include Neal Morse from Spock's Beard and Mikael Akerfelt of Opeth). But the real reason I can give a high grade to this material that I already know like the back of my hand: Hackett's playing throughout is exemplary, and he sounds as good as ever, his soaring leads making the whole trip that much more worth taking.
0743270754|5.0|I've never been a big fan of this author, though I'll admit to also having never read any of her books. I have little patience with wealthy successful authors who get caught up in plagarism scandals, where they copy from someone else's work, and make more money. She also spoke up rather sharply criticizing Robert Caro, when the first volume of his LBJ bio came out. Her criticism was a political version of \\"The rich are different\\"; essentially, maybe LBJ did bad things, but he was a great president, and that excuses bad behavior. So I generally had a bad impression of her. This book showed up on the table at Costco in the summer; I bought it almost without thinking, and then a couple of weeks ago, decided I shoud read it before the movie came out, because I know I want to see that.<br /><br />So I start reading, and frankly at first I'm surprised, and then pleasantly impressed. The book is very well-written, and the author essentially goes out of her way to bring to the forefront of history people most modern Americans never heard of, or at least know much about. The first section of the book (rather less than half) covers the prewar careers of four men: Lincoln himself, his Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, his Secretary of State William Henry Seward, and his Attorney General Edward Bates. The author follows them right up to the Republican Convention in 1860, and then through the Presidential election. The rest of the book covers the Lincoln Administration, discussing how the cabinet handled things, what they discussed, and at least in some depth discusses the rest of the members of that cabinet, mostly Edwin Stanton (Secretary of War), Gideon Welles (Navy Secretary) and Montgomery Blair (Postmaster General). The author has a number of wonderful anecdotes to tell, from Stanton cutting Lincoln out of a legal case in the mid 1850s and then a decade later admitting he was \\"never more decieved\\" than that day, to Welles' distress with the various disagreements in the cabinet, and the feud between Chase and Monty Blair and his family, which went on essentially for as long as either man was in the cabinet. She has dozens of anecdotes, from Lincoln's story about Ethan Allen thinking that the picture of George Washington in an English privy was appropriate to Salmon Chase insisting on swearing in the first black attorney licensed to practice there when he took over the Supreme Court. It's a wonderful chatty, informative, well-written book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the whole thing, and I think much better of the author now. Hopefully she'll produce something else interesting.
B0033B5XCS|4.0|Item was accurately described, packaging was sufficient.  These were a major part of my teen years and now I will watch them with my daughter.  Excellent price!
B009439HEY|5.0|This is a wonderful re-visitation of Steve's stay with the Progressive Rock giant, Genesis.  There is an obvious love of the classic Genesis material expressed by Mr. Hackett.  He has recruited a first class slate of collaborators and artists to realize his vision of presenting these songs in the best light.  A highlight for me is the vocals of Steven Wilson on Can-Utility and the Coastliners - you can sense the respect Wilson has for the original material, while adding his own touches.  Brillaint playing thoughout, but you expect nothing less from the brilliant Mr. Hackett.  He continues to grow as an artist, and I will continue to look forward to his contributions in the years to come.  He just gets better and better!
B003U4UNUU|5.0|This was the most amazing show ever. I cried like a little baby through the final episode. The End was perfect. Vincent coming to Jack in the end was awesome. Each of them finally finding each other and finding peace, yes priceless. The show was awesome. I loved watching it on my Kindle. I enjoyed reading all the reviews. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!
B008VNIBFO|5.0|Sunset Boulevard is one of the greatest classic movies of all time.  Along with All About Eve, which came out in 1950 as well, this movie showcases an aging actress giving a tour de force performance.  Gloria Swanson, a former silent movie star herself, provides one of the greatest performances by any actress in movie history.  Her performance is just as powerful today as it was over 60 years ago.  And with William Holden and Erich von Stroheim delivering strong performances as well, Sunset Boulevard continues to leave a lasting impression on those who see it.<br /><br />The picture quality comes to life with this blu-ray release.  The classic film noir black and white contrast shines and grain is still intact but never distracting.  Aside for a few blemishes in certain scenes, this picture quality captures the film noir feel that Billy Wilder intended.  The audio is also excellent.  The dialogue is very clear and the Academy Award-winning score bursts through the speakers with great clarity.<br /><br />If you have not seen Sunset Boulevard do yourself a favor and watch this classic movie reborn on Blu-ray.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book is absolutely a page turner, it keeps my interest at it's peak, you can pick up exactly where you left off, the way it is worded is just utterly magnificent to the point I sometimes have to refer to my dictionary and I think that alone is just wonderful because I love for my vocab to be heightened. \\"Great Read\\"

B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is pretty awesome. I love running into awesome looking mutants it is one of the best games for the kindle fire I have ever seen.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|The first half of the book was too involved with relationships.  I finally got to the middle which was more interesting but did rehash what many of us already know about WWII
B008XG1X18|4.0|Although the desktop version is better,  I am pleased to have Pintrest on my Kindle. It could be improved by having easier search functions.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I have read other Jack Reacher books and this one being the first was quite interesting to read after reading some of the later stories.  This book is well written, as usual, and holds your interest through the entire book.  Significant \\"revelations\\" keep popping up throughout the story and that kept my interest as I tried to figure out the culprits on my own.  Jack is quite tame compared to later editions but none the less it is a good story with great action and suspense.  I would recommend the book highly<br /><br />DVG
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|I am a great fan of Gary Cooper and I respect him as an actor. I especially like his westerns, notably \\"High Noon\\" and \\"The Hanging Tree.\\" Gary Cooper is great in any role he plays, and always gives a top-notch performance. In \\"The Fountainhead,\\" Cooper plays an architect that wants to make it \\"Big\\" and become highly successful. The movie makes for great melodrama but does not provide for a deal of action scenes, unless you call the dynamiting of a building an \\"action scene.\\" The film includes Patricia Neal in her first great co-starring role. Remember, she was the one that in later years got the academy award for Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress in \\"Hud\\" with Paul Newman. It also includes Raymond Massey, a great character actor who always gave a great performance.The film is in black-and-white and the background scenes, especially of tall buildings as scene through an office balcony are just studio painted props.The movie makes for great drama, and if you are a Gary Cooper fan, as I am, you will enjoy this gem.
0345803485|1.0|I'm an avid reader, and I couldn't finish it. So boring, repetitious, pompous, awful. Wow, good to know you can write horseshit and earn millions with it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first 50 pages are slow... But boy once you get past that you are hooked! Would definitely suggest this to many people that I know.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|This movie was recently shown on satellite TV and attempting to watch it while doing other things was totally impossible.  I ended up recording it so I could watch it without interruption.  I was really pleased to finally see a good movie offered on a premium channel...it's a rare treat.  I'm totally enamored with this film.  Gary Oldman and Colin Firth are excellent actors making this film even more enjoyable.  I figured out the \\"eyeglasses\\" which made the flashbacks easier to understand.  This movie slowly, but surely, gains momentum...it certainly made me want to not miss any portions because clues/motives can be a brief blip.  Instead of watching my grainy recording, I dropped in to Amazon to buy the DVD.  I have a large DVD library and this is one that definitely needs to be added to my collection...it's a winner.  I also recently purchased the book...a much belated reading.  LeCarre's books are a hard read for me.  By watching the movie, I now know who the main characters are making the reading far easier plus it adds faces to the names.
0061148512|2.0|Esther Greenwood is Sylvia Plath. Her slow descent into terrible crippling depression is boring but I think the point is, depression is painful but not exciting. Her mother wanted very much to help her troubled daughter but it was impossible to reach her. Esther/Sylvia was a brilliant girl with great intellect. That is also a point. Mental illness can affect the brightest people. Her reason for her crippling depression is unclear because no one knows that much about why some people fall into such hell with no reason to. Esther/Sylvia had great opportunities  ahead of her. She had win  literary prizes & also had  VERY NICE BEAU WHO SINCERELY LOVED HER NONE OF THIS MATTERED.<br />KNOWING WHAT EVENTUALLY BEFELL SYLVIA PLATH MAKES IT DOUBLY PAINFUL. I AM GLAD SHE DIDN'T DECIDE TO gas  HER 2 sleeping  CHILDREN with  HER WHEN SHE STUCK HER HEAD IN the  OVEN.<br />A TRAGIC AFTERMATH IS THAT HER HUSBAND, TED HUGHES' SECOND WIFE, ALSO KILLED HERself plus their child! His third wife was a  nurse (does that say something?). Hughes was the poet who was sort of the Queen Mother's poet laureate or I guess that means he wrote verse praising  her.<br />Because  you know what eventually happens to Sylvia/Esther it makes the whole long tale more tragic. The story does become boring but the pain this poor girls suffered shouldn't be diminished because depression is boring. I can't say I enjoyed this book after the first 100 pages, it became more tedious but that is the point of her narrative Her life was depressing/tedious & she couldn't stop it.

0812984412|4.0|I hadn't heard about this book until I saw the initial 6 minute long trailer for the movie. It immediately grabbed my attention. It appeared to be everything a movie could be. After doing some research into the novel this movie was being adapted from, I decided I had to check it out.<br /><br />This book is different from every book I have ever read. There are six seperate, yet somewhat linked stories. You get the first half of the first five stories, then you get the whole sixth story. From there, you get the conclusions of each story starting with the fifth and going back to the first. So, the book starts and ends with the same story.<br /><br />Each of the stories are written in completely different styles. Mitchell is an amazing writer because he did this so well. The language in each section appears very true to each time period from the late 1800s to modern day and to the future. Mitchell invents his own style of language and grammar for the future stories. One is told in the near future and the sixth story takes place in a post apocalyptic world.<br /><br />Mitchell is an excellent storyteller. Although the language may be difficult to get into, once you have entered the world you won't want to finish each section. Leaving a story halfway through, usually at a climax or even midsentence makes you want to continue reading the next story even more so you can get to the second half. But then, you get engulfed by the story of the new story.<br /><br />The experience of reading this book is so unique. While reading the second half of the book, you feel like you are finishing a whole book every forty pages or so.<br /><br />Not only is each story told in its own style, language, and timframe, but each is a different genre. You will definitely have a favorite story when reading this book. It may be the geriatric comedy, the post apocalyptic epic, the young musician's tragic life, the lawyer's journey on the high seas, or the journalist's 70's mystery. My favorite was the genetic engineered fast food server's tale of self discovery.<br /><br />Mitchell does an excellent job weaving in ideas of self and philosophical questions. It is up to you to interpret you these six stories fit together.<br /><br />I give this novel a 4/5. It is an excellent read, but the concept of it is so much to wrap your head around. I suggest this to anyone who loves to read all different kinds of books.s the genetic engineered fast food server's tale of self discovery.<br /><br />Mitchell does an excellent job weaving in ideas of self and philosophical questions.

0812984412|5.0|I was giddy the entire way through the book. I enjoyed every part equally and immensely. All I can say is to read it, and it's most like you won't regret it if you enjoy at least anything more complicated than your average Joe. One of my favorites.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was a wonderful surprise I was prepared to read a \\"young adult\\" book, but I found it to be a fun read.  I liked it so much I immediately downloaded the trilogy to my kindle.  It wasn't the \\"great american novel\\" but it was entertaining and fun, I really enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It downloaded really fast. And it has page numbers which I like a lot because kindle does not and that is annoying
0062515675|2.0|A friend recommended it and I just can't get through it. Nice enough philosophy, but it reads like it was written by high school sophomore C English student. Some of it is so bad I'm embarrassed for the author and put it down for a week or a month.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I usually do not read the type of literature, but after reading the first book, I went right to the second. It is an easy read, and the passion of the characters seemed real.
B0081BU42O|3.0|I'll assume you've read one of Iain Banks' Culture novels before.<br /><br />This book had a lot of the elements of Culture books that I've enjoyed in the past, but I felt--and I may be missing something subtler that he was going for--that the storyline wasn't terribly captivating because you know from almost the very beginning of the book exactly what's going on. As a result, there's a great deal of running around to, basically, confirm what we knew in chapter 2.<br /><br />So I found that frustrating but it was still reasonably fun and brought more details about Subliming--something I've wanted to see for a while.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Oh my gosh this book is amazing!!!! Like there is going to be so much surprises in this book it's ridiculous. This book is my favorite out of the whole series!!

0812982622|4.0|There are very few novels set in modern day North Korea - with good reason. The political regime is so secretive and alien that research must be a nightmare. It's very hard to gauge how accurate a representation Adam Johnson's book is of this but it seems to be at least plausible and generally believable. What he does so well is to move from the opening slightly smug \\"isn't the propaganda thing a bit funny in terms of what people there believe\\" to making the reader really care and understand how shocking the effects of this can be on the individual lives of the people there. There are scenes of horrific suffering but Johnson retains a light touch wherever he can - so the Dear Leader, Kim Jon iL, is presented at times as being \\"lonely\\" in a nice nod to You Tube clips.<br /><br />Johnson's hero, Jun Do, grows up in an orphanage run by his father. However he presents a mixture of people from all levels of society - there are those who believe in the myth of the leader and the propaganda, those who know the truth and use it to their own advantage and those who know the truth and use it just to survive. The challenge for a fiction writer is of course that it relies on personal stories and in a political culture like North Korea the individuality is suppressed.<br /><br />The setting is fascinating and original and that does much to offset some of the aspects that perhaps stretch belief a little. It's hard to believe that Jun Do's lack of commitment to the cause would allow him to hold some of the positions that he finds himself in for example, but interchanging roles seems to be part of the model and presumably the argument against this goes that the leadership don't even question that everyone buys in to the story and aren't just compliant through fear.<br /><br />At first the narrative is split between Jun Do's story and the official announcements of the State but later on we also get the story of an Interrogator. While this introduces a vital element to the story themixture of the three strands doesn't always feel as smooth as it could do. However, it is a fascinating subject and a highly original book that celebrates the human spirit in impossible conditions. There's humor, a love story and fascinating insight into a mysterious country. Johnson is well worth reading - this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship, as a not unrelated movie might have put it.
6305161879|5.0|I was very pleased about the price of this product as well as the delivery time that it took for the product to be shipped from California to Georgia. It took about three days. It was perfectly wrapped. It wasn't too large or a box and it wasn't too small of a box. When the product said that it was \\"Brand New\\" it was exactly as claimed to be! It was \\"BRAND NEW\\". It still had its manufacturer packaging on it!<br /><br />I was very pleased with my purchase!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Check out \\"Two Minutes At The Gate\\" on Kindle download, amazing story of a near death experience! Great read, real page turner, only 100 pages.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I expected a typical Grisham novel and was suprised to see a nice legal thriller where the twists were good. I think this came from writing pure fiction rather than trying to model the real world.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I read Grisham novels like I watch television series: the first episodes really grab your attention, and the following ones are sometimes good, but never quite give you the intensity of emotions as the first ones. As such, my expectations are never too high.<br />This latest installment is a good story with interesting twists, but the author had to stretch it out in order to get to a book sized length. I also couldn't help noticing  some similarity to other stories: think \\"The Pelican Brief\\" meets \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".<br />Still, a good read for Grisham fans.

B004AFFZNI|4.0|Ok, so if you're like me and you bought the gopro mainly to use in auto racing or outdoor activity use, then you would expect the gopro not only to capture great video, but also great sound. Not the case if you are using the stock housing that comes with the gopro. The skeleton housing is a must-buy for any gopro to get better sound. This particular skeleton housing would have been perfect if they included something to control high-wind noise such as when the gopro is mounted on a car or any other fast moving object. I have seen some items on Amazon that does that and gopro should have already included that with this skeleton. But other than that, the item does it job in creating better sound for your footage and also easy access to ports and cooling capabilities.
1407130293|5.0|The triology set was exactly as described and my daughter is thrilled with it. Glad to do business with this enterprise again in the future.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Being a die hard hp fan and a lover of good books, I obviously was looking forward to the release of Rowling's first ever adult novel. I have practically read everything she has published till date, even the extra books outside the hp series (like quidditch through the ages and fantastic beasts and where to find them). Why, you would ask. Because I love the way she writes. Classy and giving immense importance to details which not a lot of writers do. Even tiny details like what the character is eating gives a very personalized feel to the reader and practically takes him inside the book,as if everything is happening for real. But I guess my expectations were higher for this book. I expected a political story, as the name suggests, some dirty politics and an exciting climax. Till the very end I was hoping that something would happen which would make me think &#34;ooh i did not expect that&#34;. But nope, even the last page did not make me believe that the novel had actually ended. Its just a story of different people living in a town dealing with family and work issues. Honestly, had this not been written by Rowling I wouldn't have read it till the end, but that's just me, I am not particularly a fan of plain jane novels and I expected a lot out of this book. Her writing is still brilliant, I still loved the way she wrote the book, if not the story itself.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I like all Jack Reacher novels but there has become a sameness that is off-putting. i.e the four star's instead of five. Give us newer plots and let him get in more trouble, more serious trouble. Let the Army call him back for a stint.  It's done you know. Okay, don't but I'm hooked so I'll buy the next one as well.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great one from Grisham: Don't know what to expect next.  The usual page turner with lots of entertaining dialogue.  Great book!
0425263908|1.0|Good news is I didn't buy this book; a friend loaned it to me, so I didn't actually waste money on this dribble.<br />I think I made it half way through before I just couldn't make myself read another word. Neither of the main characters are likeable.
B008ENA74E|3.0|I am about half way through and to me the author sounds like a cry baby.  Does anyone think, that when you have the ability to make millions of dollars a year it is a nine to five job, and you are not dealing with some of the most driven, ruthless people alive.

0061122416|5.0|This book really only needs one word to describe it: Profound.<br /><br />There are few books like this in the world. A book that tells an amazing story and is a self-help book as well.<br /><br />It is truly thought provoking. There's not a lot of character development, but a story like this doesn't need it as it is more about the central message than the characters. This is a life changing book.<br /><br />If for some reason you can only read one fictional book in your life it should be The Alchemist. It is uniquely written, has an original story that is designed to inspire your daily life, and is profound on so many levels.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Very expensive production along with a lot of special effects.  Interesting and entertaining but a little too drawn out.  Not enough action.

B000WOWWXC|5.0|When I first heard about this band, I had downloaded the first track Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus. My first reaction was mixed as is with all of my progressive escapades. I loved the energy that came with the song, I was just a little off put by the vocals and the concluding section. Soon I downloaded L'Via L'Viaquez and again reached mixed results with the overall experience. But the thing about my criticisms is that I always ended up listening to these songs over and over again. Soon I decided to purchase the entire album: and what I got was certainly more than what I had paid for. From Sarcophagi to Sarcophagi, I was blown away. For these types of albums, it certainly takes several listens to really dissect the music. But my best idea of what to describe this album would go along the lines of: If Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin dropped some Mexican acid and then procreated, this would be the spawn. The vocals just absolutely kill it for me; he is singing is heart out in Cygnus, torturing himself in the Widow, and softly suffering in Miranda. And Cassandra Gemini, in my honest opinion, is this generation's Echoes. The rest of the band truly shines, the vibe is certainly that of a band that rocks in all aspects of the definition. This \\"rock\\" may seem like a barrage of cacophony to some, but the sporadic jamming somehow becomes cohesive and it all makes sense in the end. I would love to decipher each song, but this is a review and not a novel. The only problem I had was the aforementioned interludes to each song which requires a lot of patience. On some days, it feels right and nicely accentuates each song from the next. But other days I find myself just skipping which I know isn't the right choice but that's how it goes. Nonetheless, the songs have me endlessly screaming, soloing, drumming like I'm right there entranced by the album's unbelievable vocalizations and instrumentation. And isn't that what music is all about?
B009JNXK88|5.0|I love this game. It has to be one of the on mobile that I've played. But I do have a suggestion that would make the game so much better and more interesting: more variation would be nice, such as more varied types of enemies and maybe being able to change your character's appearance and/or moves/attacks.
B001LF347E|5.0|What the creators lacked in funds they made up for in story line. The effects are a bit cheesy. And sometimes the acting is overboard. However, the story is amazing. This is not your typical King Arthur/Merlin story.<br /><br />If you like magic, action, knights tales, or a love stories, check this out.<br /><br />You begin to follow Merlin at a young age, through him finding his abilities, and saving Prince Arthur many times secretly as he cannot reveal who he is.<br />The story constantly goes off on its new path, reinventing major parts to suit the TV show, which which actually really works well for the show.<br />So you will certainly never be bored because you feel like \\"youve seen this before\\".<br /><br />The characters are awesome, especially Merlin & his guardian, Gauis.
1608199096|5.0|Polpo is an amazingly beautiful book from Russell Norman's restaurant Polpo. Starting with the unusual binding, and the gorgeous botanical type drawing on the covers. Inside the covers, a beautiful sepia map drawing of Venice. The binding allows the book to lay open very flat, but it also has an old-world look and feel to it, which is carried through to the paper. Polpo is heavily illustrated with photos of the food and the area, as well as 140 relatively simple recipes that look divine.<br /><br />The book is divided into the following sections:<br /><br />Introduction<br />Cicheti (Small Snacks, such as Smoked Salmon, Horseradish and Dill Crostini)<br />Breads (Stracchino, Potato, and Rosemary Pizzetta; Stracchino, Fennel Salami, and Fig Bruschette)<br />Fish (Soft-Shell Crab in Parmesan Batter and Fennel Salad)<br />Meat (Rabbit, Sage, and Apricot Terrine)<br />Vegetables (Panzanella; Grilled Zucchini Salad)<br />Desserts (Chocolate Salami)<br />Drinks (Negroni)<br />Gazetteer (a short guide to some of Venice's wine bars and restaurants).<br /><br />The recipes look like they will be surprisingly easy to make. I plan to make Rocket and Walnut Pesto Crostini, Spinach, Soft Egg and Parmesan Pizzetta, Burrata with Lentils and Basil Oil, Garlic and Chilli Prawns, Warm Autumn Fruits with Amaretto Cream, Cavolo Nero, Gnocchi and Pecorino Romano, and Tiramisu Pots, to name a few. The recipes all look pretty delightful, it is difficult to decide just what you will make first.<br /><br />So now for the bad news. First of all, the ingredients/ instructions are given in a mixture of metric and English. eg. 120g cooked cotechino, 1 X 400g tin of chickpeas, 160 degree C/ Gas 3 setting for the oven, 50 ml vodka, 85g caster sugar, 4 tablespoons of olive oil. So fire up your calculator and brain, or get a digital scale that measures in metric and English. A few of the ingredients might be difficult to find, for example salt cod and monksbeard, but the recipes really make you want to go through the trouble of finding it. Secondly, the very beauty of the book cause me issues. I used to hate to write in any book, even cookbooks. I have gotten over that and make my own notes now, and this book screams for me to transfer the metric temps, etc. into English units and scribble them in. However, this book is such a work of art, I truly hate to mess it up by writing in it.t to go through the trouble of finding it. Secondly, the very beauty of the book cause me issues.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Throughout my life I've met people who questioned my quietness and translated my quiet nature as shyness, lack of confidence, or snobbishness--usually something negative. Thanks so much to Susan Cain for beautfully articulating the inner world and truth of introverts. I think introverts are often misinterpreted and misunderstood, and it is very validating to have someone present the qualities of introverts clearly and definitively as assets, not weaknesses.  I have wondered at times if something was wrong with me for wanting others to just calm down, be quiet, and let my brain have some peace to just think and process.  This book gave words to feelings I have not myself been able to conceptualize. A must have for any introvert who has felt out of place and out of sorts in a world of extroverts or for extroverts living with introverts!

B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter just HAD to have this Monster High school for her 5th birthday.  Being the super awesome mom that I am, I bought it, hoping to make her birthday wish come true ;)  And it did!!  She adores the thing!!  However, I can't help but feel a little ripped off.  The large stickers that make up the walls of the school were slightly mis-placed, making a bubble.  They were impossible to reposition so I had to jsut smash it down and call it a day.  Overall, it's a pretty flimsy toy.  Even when fully assembled, it's a little shaky.  And the pieces want to pop off.  It did come with a lot of cute litle accessories and my daughter loves it so I guess that's all that matters.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars proves that Rovio is capable of delivering quality apps , even in the same franchise in this case. Angry Birds Star Wars is a parody of Stars Wars in the form of the beloved series, Angry Birds. In this game, the red bird has taken the position of Luke Skywalker while the pigs are stormtroopers. The pig king ,obviously, has taken the role of Darth Vader.  The other birds have taken the roles of the Star Wars characters you love such as, Obi-Wan, Chewbacca, and Princess Leis. These are not just looks though. Now, each bird has a star wars related power ( including the red bird). The red bird has a lightsaber for you to use, while Obi-Wan can use the force and Han Solo can shoot with his gun. There are many other powers to discover, but I won't spoil them. Instead, go get this app now!
B0010SKUYM|2.0|I have been reading fantasy books since the 70's. I have read a lot of good ones and a lot of bad ones. This book falls somewhere in the middle. I even feel the three stars are a bit generous.<br /><br />After reading all the glorious reviews, I was expecting a lot more. I just don't see what others see in this book. I am happy that others enjoy it. Also, the more critical reviews for book two were a big factor in not continuing the series. I don't care to read books with a lot of sexual content.<br /><br />For me, I will seek another fantasy series.

It's laughable how loud and distorted this record is. The self titled is full of power while this thing is one big bloated pile of distortion.

Somehow, I don't think it will be long before students start incorporating fictional elements of ALVH into their reports on Abraham Lincoln. I'm glad I don't teach American History.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have spent the weeks since A Wanted Man was released pondering my response to this latest Lee Child \\"Jack Reacher\\" novel.  I have read and reread the reviews especially Reacher Creature's review.  Initially, I was influenced by this review and the many comments submitted and thought that this was a horrible novel.<br /><br />Why do I read novels:  To escape my humdrum life and try to experience excitement in someone else's life.  In other words, Jack Reacher's life.  While I wish that Reacher had reached Virginia, he would not have have found Susan because she was in Afganistan (sp).  There was a lot of this novel that was missing the Reacher touch especially his touch with the main woman character (sex), his head butting, his single clearing of a room, and the intimidation by just looking at him.<br /><br />Even though this novel was given few stars by most reviewers, I still love Jack Reacher even if written ghostly. I love the flight from reality with the eye SOS.  I don't want reality, I want Jack Reacher!!!

B001NLKT60|5.0|Intelligent and well-written. This book defines the term \\"page-turner.\\"  I literally could not put it down towards the end, and stayed up long past midnight finishing it.
0446580848|4.0|DeMille teams up two of his best lead characters - - John Corey and Paul Brenner - - in this political action thriller that takes place primarily in the Middle East dregs of Yemen.  Corey and Brenner, along with Corey's FBI wife Kate Mayfield and a few other Americans, are hunting down The Panther, who masterminded the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, before he can hunt down Corey and Mayfield.<br /><br />DeMille's narration is first class, as always, and who doesn't love the smart-ass humor of DeMille's John Corey?  I must say, though, the action and suspense are pretty much saved for the final hundred pages or so.<br /><br />Since DeMille brought the characters of Corey and Brenner together, I was hoping he would find a clever way to employ use of the first person for both of them (offering their two distinct perspectives), but instead he chose to first person Corey and third person Brenner, which relegated the Paul Brenner character to just another character in the story.  Too bad - - a big opportunity missed in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall an excellent read from one of the most skillful wordsmiths of his generation!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect going in, but I must admit this is a very entertaining game easy to learn and dive in
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham delivered another quick enjoyable read.  It includes a few twist and turns. But It did bear similarities to some of his earlier works and the end was a little predictable.  Grisham fans will enjoy the quick pace and the easy readability. While the book included a number of characters it was easy to keep them straight.  Legal concepts and terms were explained in context. I couldn't wait to finish it..
B0091REZMW|3.0|was a great game until you have start using real money to buy diamonds to continue. so pretty much a rip off.

0316212377|5.0|The Gzilt want to Sublime. And author Iain M. Banks wants to put a few obstacles in their way. This book is a great imagination-expander. Vast space ships. A city comprised of a trough circling the entire equator of its planet. Cracking good hostile encounters. A bit of decadent sex. And the Minds, playing a sort of chess with all the bits. The Minds are the super sentient consciousnesses that independently control the space ships in the story.<br /><br />The Minds want to help the Gzilt humanoids complete their generations long quest to rise to a higher plane of being,(from which no report has ever returned). When the smooth path to the Zero Day (when all Gzilt Sublime) becomes rocky, the Minds step in to help. These are not the evil ship minds so popular in some sci-fi; they want to assist. They also have individual personalities and motivations.<br /><br />The Hydrogen Sonata is part detective story and part sheer, wonderful space opera. Mr. Banks is a tremendously skilled and inventive writer. This is not a comic book scenario, it is more like an intricate waltz. There are a few well-drawn human (and not so human) characters, but fundamentally the Minds carry the story.<br /><br />The Hydrogen Sonata is one of Mr. Banks' \\"Culture\\" series of books. I highly recommend them all as a way to send your mind into the infinite reaches of a wonderful fictional universe.
B0095R64AO|4.0|I really liked this movie and was surprised at the plethora of negative views. Yes, it's two hours, but it's cute and details the evolution of a relationship. I enjoyed it. I liked the flash backs to when the couple first met, yes, it was done more than once, but it seemed to tie everything back around to that one important moment.<br /><br />The only part I did not care for was the Spanish song sung at the sister's wedding and REALLY did not like it at the end. I saw the point it created at the sister's wedding, but the song sucks and I hate that it ended on that note. The use of Into the Mystic was great. All they had to do was cut the film off at the first kiss on NYE after they finished the couple's wedding scene. That would have been better.

B0071BGOJC|3.0|Ken Follet has once again written a nicely flowing story, but a bit too obvious. The goodies are good and the baddies are bad, and you see them coming a mile away. And you could be thick as two planks and still not miss the message: Fascism and communism are bad. Follet hammers than in on every possible occasion when his heroes get up and go fight totalitarianism. But, annoying though this can get, I still could not help getting fascinated by the story and muddle through to see what happens to the heroes. And, even with a largely subdued enthousiasm, I still look forward to the final part of the trilogy.

B0052GVGYG|5.0|The winning combination of Susan Tedeschi's voice and the slide guitar brilliance of Derk Trucks, (not to mention the horn and vocal backup), makes for a great sound and a great album. There are plenty of blues bands with the standout guitar slasher to go around, but this band has its own sound. For those of us who remember the Allman Bros as a new group, you can hear echos of that sound. For Bonnie Raitt fans, you can hear echos of her vocal style. Eric Clapton has nothing but good things to say about this group and especially Derek Trucks, which is as good as it gets for a recommendation. If you are a blues fan, you need this album.

0861714911|5.0|no exaggeration. i wasted YEARS on other new forms of buddhism: vajrayana developed up to 1,200 years after buddhas death, zen developed up to 900 years after buddhas death, and others (pure land doesn't even count as it's not about awakening, but going to a very late invented buddhist realm AFTER death based on faith in a very late invented \\"amitabha buddha\\"). do these other forms work? not for me! maybe they do for others. but the bottom line is that the original teachings are just that: the original. they are laid out in a step by step frame to lead one to awakening. bodhi has compiled many here to make them very simple and straightforward (otherwise one must read hundreds of pages to get the step by step feel as they are recorded in massive volumes, very spread out. totally worth it though, i have all of his translations). whereas zen is totally reliant on teachings of individual zen masters and the same goes for vajrayana (ie. the practice is not recorded in full in their respective scriptures for said schools). if you try to just read all the mahayana scriptures (all written after the original scriptures were recorded) without reading any works by teachers of those sects or having an actual teacher, you will be lost in a mass of contradictions and confusion.<br /><br />for example if you read the lankavatara sutra you will learn vague ideas about meditating, then read the infinite life sutras and you will think you should be praying to amitabha, then read vajrayana stuff and you will think you should be praying to tibetan gods, practicing dream yoga, and spinning prayer wheels. the original teachings are reliant on THE BUDDHA'S teachings which are internally consistent and not confusing. they are about morality, meditation to still and gladden the mind (culminating in equanimity and higher states), and finally reflection on reality in order to see through it's constructs. they do not teach any other practices or worship of any \\"buddhas\\" or \\"gods\\", and there is no conflict from one sutta (sanskrit: sutra) to another. sounds like the right choice to me!<br /><br />i didn't even know this was the original teachings. this is a collection of texts from the oldest known record of the buddha's teachings (other than the agamas which are preserved in chinese and are of numerous schools and therefore less consistent, some as old as this, some newer, some of unknown origin, and so on), without these, there would be no buddhism. this is from the pali canon or pali tipitaka from the oldest surviving school the theravada.<br /><br />years and years i spent practicing versions of buddhism with little fruit.<br /><br />then i discovered the original and had rapid progress. it's a tried and true system. i have seen through reality on multiple occasions now.<br /><br />this book is indispensable. with this and some supplementary commentaries and maybe some web reading on jhana practice and insight reflection one could easily start to have great progress.<br /><br />final note: if you dedicate your life to some other tradition under a competent teacher, you MIGHT have some success. like go ordain in a zen monastery or at the very least spend a LOT of time with a zen teacher. i really don't know and i don't want to totally knock other traditions as supposedly they work if you take it that far. but if you are practicing mostly alone like most westerners, go with the original works by the buddha himself and commentaries and supplementary teachings on those works.<br /><br />this isn't just me talking either, 99% of zen and vajrayana teachers will tell you that you MUST have a teacher to progress. most theravada will say the same, but using the scriptures as your teacher is a viable and realistic option as long as you are diligent! whereas you cannot simply read mahayana/vajrayana scriptures and walk away with any kind of consistent or complete practice methodology.no conflict from one sutta (sanskrit: sutra) to another. sounds like the right choice to me!<br /><br />i didn't even know this was the original teachings. this is a collection of texts from the oldest known record of the buddha's teachings (other than the agamas which are preserved in chinese and are of numerous schools and therefore less consistent, some as old as this, some newer, some of unknown origin, and so on), without these, there would be no buddhism. this is from the pali canon or pali tipitaka from the oldest surviving school the theravada.<br /><br />years and years i spent practicing versions of buddhism with little fruit.<br /><br />then i discovered the original and had rapid progress. it's a tried and true system. i have seen through reality on multiple occasions now.<br /><br />this book is indispensable. with this and some supplementary commentaries and maybe some web reading on jhana practice and insight reflection one could easily start to have great progress.<br /><br />final note: if you dedicate your life to some other tradition under a competent teacher, you MIGHT have some success. like go ordain in a zen monastery or at the very least spend a LOT of time with a zen teacher. i really don't know and i don't want to totally knock other traditions as supposedly they work if you take it that far. but if you are practicing mostly alone like most westerners, go with the original works by the buddha himself and commentaries and supplementary teachings on those works.<br /><br />this isn't just me talking either, 99% of zen and vajrayana teachers will tell you that you MUST have a teacher to progress. most theravada will say the same, but using the scriptures as your teacher is a viable and realistic option as long as you are diligent!

B007HU7NBK|3.0|This is definitely not a dirty secrets tell all about John or other band members, which is good. The book started out well with enough information about his childhood and a fairly detailed section about the formation of Duran Duran.  However, the next twenty years were touched on here and there without much detail in any area.  I think some things could have been left out in favor of more detail about the band's recent history.  I also felt the time aspect of the writing was very hard to follow.
B0094GW6YE|5.0|Great! Awesome old school solos - KISS is back and even better. Really quality stuff and just an awesome listen.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|\\"The Red Hot Chili Peppers Live At Slane Castle\\" deserves more than five stars. I would give it ten stars if I could.<br /><br />On this DVD the Chili Peppers prove they are one of the best live bands in the world and one of the most important bands in rock!  I have watched this DVD at least 10 times by now and it remains one of my favorite live concert DVDs. Anthony, Flea, Chad and (the great!) John Frusciante are absolutely at the top of their game here performing favorites like \\"By The Way\\", \\"Under The Bridge\\", \\"Scar Tissue\\", \\"Californication\\", \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Power of Equality\\" and a killer cover of the Ramone's \\"Havana Affair\\". Frusciante's clean, delicate, powerful guitar work is effortlessly brilliant and his high soprano harmonies blend exquisitely with Anthony's lead vocals. Anthony puts on an amazing show leaping around the stage like a man possessed. Chad Smith is an absolute monster on the drums; displaying power and precision equal to any drummer in rock. Finally Flea. Oh Flea how I love thee. Let me count the ways. There just aren't bass players this good out there. A true virtuoso.  And he plays a pretty mean trumpet too. Buy the video and see for yourself.<br /><br />Watching this video prompted me to go out and purchase the remainder of the Chili Peppers body of work on CD and purchase every other live DVD of them I could find including one that keeps getting sent to me in the wrong region code. From what I can see this is the best live document of the band out there. At $7.99 it is an INCREDIBLE bargain!! I can't recommend it highly enough! \\"Live At Slane Castle\\" is one of the best live concert DVDs ever made!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|First off, the streaming video quality from Amazon was terrific. I watched this one on my laptop but usually stream through the PS3 and am very rarely disappointed (and it's usually my ISPs fault anyway.)<br /><br />About the movie: It's worth watching for the cinematography and occasionally whimsical story line, but falls short of what it could have been with a more well rounded cast. I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said before, but Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth are fantastic and Kristen Stewart is at best flat and at worst boring. I still recommend it however for 2 hours of pure mindless escapism and mostly fun if that's what you're in need of or looking for.

1476712042|5.0|This book was such a roller coaster!<br /><br />I loved every part of it - the ups and downs of all of the relationships were so realistic! But, I have to warn you, it is a little cheesy at times, but it makes your heart skip a beat with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />I got this book yesterday at 4pm and finished it this afternoon - I could not put it down. The reader pulls you straight in and you feel like you're a friend of Abby and America's.<br /><br />I will read this again - and a little heads up, there are some steamy scenes that are to die for! ;)<br /><br />PS: they are making it into a movie (ahhh - pure happiness!)
B0058SNNOE|4.0|Cute alternative to flip-flops. Color and style is so cute, other ladies would stop me to ask about them. Only complaint is the nubby &#34;massaging&#34; footbed---they felt like sharp little rocks in my shoes. Once I got used to them, or they wore down a bit, they weren't so bad. I bought them for vacation and used them as water shoes, for boating, walking, shopping--even went on a long cave tour with lots of damp steps. They clean up easily and I wear them all the time.

0525953728|5.0|Wow! Almost three thousand Reviews prior to mine, so I won't repeat the aforementioned, but rather, put in my own plugs.<br /><br />I have seen various documentaries on t.v. illustrating the situation of the mission, Operation Neptune Spear.  This book is different than that of the documentaries.  And that is why I wanted to know of this story first hand--by a Special Ops. person who happened to be a team leader, and one of whom had access in seeking out this mass murderer in a compound consisting precisely of enemy encroaching protection.  With that said, it happened, not as smoothly as was to be initiated, but with the final outcome to be completed...that of ending Osama bin Laden's further destruction on mankind.<br /><br />If you want a good book learning more of this Seal Team 6, then this is for you.  Not only will you learn exactly what went down in the compound, you will be told of this Seal Team by this soldier's narrations, his thoughts, and his conversations.  This is a never forgotten mission executed by a certain group of men from our military on the ground who trained endlessly, along with all those involved with listening and watching the best that they could in command posts.<br /><br />I discovered another meaning to a name that had not been explained in a documentary, and that is the word Geronimo.  The word had meaning to all branches involved with this mission.  Geronimo was to be used in reference to Osama bin Laden if...he had been found, was in the custody of the USA special force teams, and if this mission had been safely accomplished by gaining access back into Afghanistan.  Everyone in on this longed to hear that word...knowing the mission was accomplished...waiting the longest and most important 40 minutes plus, of their lives!  No one other than Team 6 could see what was happening; the same applying on the helicopters--seeing one crash land and having the author of the book being in that helicopter, so close to the opening of the door that he could have easily lost his life due to the crash landing (not to be attributed by the pilot) but by air factors explained. This happened at the mission's beginning, everyone in communication of seeing it hoping that it did not kill those inside the chopper or hinder a 'possible once in a life time' historical accomplishment.  When all was clear and the teams  were all basically unharmed, were in their choppers with the body of bin Laden along with his vast wealth of media including discs, drives, tapes, and his own writings, and once across the border of Pakistan and back into Afghanistan as that is where they started from, all those involved could breath and react! Not just those in the White House as we all remember that intense picture, but those in hangers; those who refueled the choppers and for all the other special ops snipers who were in the bushes ready to kill if anyone followed the choppers with the 'precious cargo' who were being refueled; to those at C.I.A. mission headquarters; to Rangers who were ready to do their job; and to the Navy who took the body and did a respectful Muslim burial, though not allowing a trail to his tomb within the dark, deep waters, be of observation. We can not imagine how so many people involved must have felt.<br /><br />When I think about Geronimo, I think back when our soldiers in Iraq searched and stumbled upon a well hidden Saddam Hussein.  After a soldier had discovered him and told him that 'President Bush had sent his regards', I then thought of when Paul Bremer walking to his podium those years prior and said to our nation and to the world, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen...We Got Him!\\" Years later, proudly again due to our United States Military of Special Ops, President Obama, (who made the decision for the way that this mission would be played out) went to his podium to tell the world of this #1 World's Most Wanted Man, now dead by an undercover operation involving a Special Ops team.<br />Goose bumps still travel my arms when I think back to both and how proud I am to have such an intelligent military working diligently for our nation...behind desks and those on the field everywhere.  One can not do without the other, as that is to be.<br /><br />A must read book if ever I have recommended one!<br />This is history in the making!
0307730697|5.0|This is a wondeful book!!  I have sent a copy to my niece and she is passing it on as I am.

I am starting to run out of missions though and I hope they will continue adding to and updating this game.  I'm probably not really very good at it but it's so much fun anyway.  I do hope they will add some girls so I don't have to keep running as a guy!!! But I don't care, I'm running anyway!<br />Thank you for a totally fun game.

B007VUCAVO|3.0|I got a new Kindle Fire and so I had to get lots and lots of apps. I bought the paid for one of these but I am not sure if it is wonderful or not. It does a great job of showing how charged my batteries are, what their temperature is, how much voltage they have, how long it will take to recharge them, how long each different function will take to discharge the batteries and lots of other information. I guess my reply is, so what? I still recharge it when it needs it and use it all the time for whatever I want to and the Kindle came with a built in charge indicator. I keep it because it is nice to look at but it probably is not worth having.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I've heard it from start to finish and I sincerely wish I hadn't bothered. Honkin' on Bobo should have been the final release and they could have bowed out gracefully with some dignity.<br /><br />The new album sounds sterile and clinical and it's obvious they phoned this one in. But then again, I had no expectations from Aerosmith to begin with ever since Steven became an Idol judge. 11 years and they still, STILL have to hire outside writers? Enough of the Diane Warren songs!<br /><br />KISS wins,
0785163174|1.0|I'm one of the biggest Marvel fan you're going to get. I'm one of the BIGGEST fan of comics...PERIOD! So why am I giving this a ONE star?? Because this is one of the WORST big event series I have EVER read. I totally agree with the other reviewers here that this was a total waste of time and I'm mad that anyone spent money on this. The stories were not stories. A lot of the writing was like reading Soap operas from TV but in text form. Cheesy, melodramatic, doesn't make sense, stupid lines, lousy moments. It's all there. For example, when Captain America and the Avengers were in the desert and Cap is talking to someone and pleading for his/her help, because without it, they would not have a chance to win this fight. As Cap goes on, the camera pulls back and we see the rest of the heroes standing behind him. Cap goes on and on, the writer makes us, the readers, thinking that Cap is talking to someone that's going to turn the tide of the battle with the Phoenix, and we can't wait to see who it is! I was thinking, as I kept reading, \\"OMG, who can it be?? I mean, what other hero that hasn't helped out yet? Is it the Silver Surfer? Thor? No, Thor is there already, maybe he's asking Odin?? Or maybe the Watcher!\\" Then, when the big reveal comes as I turned the page, it's the...HULK?? What?? The Hulk is strong and all, but what's he going to do that all the other heroes couldn't do?? They have a lot of characters with strength. So Hulk is stronger than some, but how the hell he's going to turn the tide against the Phoenix?? They have THOR that is as strong as the Hulk but much much more in other powers! So what I'm getting at is that the writer wrote this build-up to make us readers believe that there's someone that Cap is trying to recruit to take the advantage on their side. Well, as all of us readers with knowledge of the characters, bunch of baloney, stupid build up, and overly cheesy and lame because as the series went on, the Hulk was no more help than a red ant biting the Phoenix's foot! That's just an example of the very bad writing that these \\"Architects\\" of Marvel has been portrayed. Throughout the series, this is what you're going to get. Waste of time and money. The only thing I would buy this book is for the art. That's it. Nothing else.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to read and use. This calculator is excellent for short calculations as it only shows one line. Turning the kindle sideways opens a geometric calculator as well.
B0070UFMOW|3.0|Upon recommendation of a friend, I went and bought the E17 but have had nothing but problems ever since. Now, I am out over $150 with nothing to show for it. About 2 months after much infrequent use, the AUX jack began to fail. It no longer was able to tightly connect any cables such as the L3 to my audio sources (e.g.,  iPhone, iPod, computers). The AUX had become too loose internally. Since I purchased the unit from B&H and it was past their 30 days policy, they totally ignored multiple requests to replace the unit.<br /><br />I ended up contacting FiiO directly for support. Folks, FiiO has no customer support or service in the USA, so we're talking China. After a week to two worth of back and forth emails, primarily because of language barrier (for some reason they kept referring to me as Sunny), they finally agreed to have me send the unit back to China.<br /><br />I sent the unit back over a month ago and that's the last I've seen of it. I had not heard back from the company and recently tried contacting them about it. Unfortunately for me because it had been so long, I somehow misplaced the tracking slip (my fault). Now, I've spent a week or so trying to get through the ridiculous language barrier again as they keep asking for my tracking number, but I don't expect to ever see my unit again.<br /><br />Anyways, I know losing the tracking slip is my fault, but my rating is based solely on the poor quality of this unit (it should not have failed so soon) and customer service. If a company like FiiO wants to do business in the US, they need to offer state-side support. This is ridiculous having to go through all these hoops.<br /><br />For those wanting to take the risk of buying FiiO products, just beware of the possibility of having to get support or a repair/replacement unit from China. Shipping stuff to China can be a huge black hole and that is something folks need to be aware of.<br /><br />Update: I've bumped my rating up to 3 starts now as the folks at FiiO came through with a replacement unit. They were very nice and understanding about the whole situation. I still think it is somewhat inconvenient having to deal with support in China and hopefully that will change in the future.

B007REV4T8|5.0|THIS is the Bond movie I've been waiting for from Daniel Craig.  While I've enjoyed the others, they were a bit heavy, without the light touches that made Bond such a great character for me.  Now, in his third outing in the role, Craig manages to be light and charming in addition to tough as nails.<br /><br />Skyfall has all the elements of a great James Bond movie.... exotic locales and chases, action, a dash of romance, and a truly memorable villain.  Javier Bardem is charming and menacing, and creates a standout bad guy, the best in several movies, at least.  The supporting cast is top-notch.<br /><br />More than anything, this story looks at the place of the intelligence operative in modern times, when enemies are not necessarily easy to identify, and when politicians question the continued viability of an aging model of covert operations.  Not only do we get to see Bond and M as age effects them (somewhat) but we are introduced to some of the next generation, who are promising in their own right.<br /><br />There are laughs, gasps, surprises and nostalgia.....<br /><br />If you've ever liked a James Bond film, you should go see this ASAP.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|The One is my third Antec case, and I shall start with some background about my experience buying other Antec cases for system builds (since 2004).<br /><br />Antec Super Lanboy (2004) 3.75/5<br /><br />The first was the Super Lanboy, which held up decently for a case that is necessarily flimsy and light--the clue to the reason for the use of thin aluminum is in its name--it was intended to be an easier case for a gamer to lug to LAN parties, and for that purpose it was suited. When I say that it is flimsy I do not necessarily mean that it was cheap--at no point did the actual aluminum parts of the case give me any trouble at all. The side window had chrome-looking \\"rivets\\" that were ultimately plastic, and a few broke due to their cheap quality. In addition, the rear fan used rubber screws that I unfortunately didn't at first know how to remove so I kinda broke the screws (I had to remove the fan to remove the motherboard). I recall sending an email to Antec about it but I do not recall receiving a response. As it was, I used twist ties like you might find on a loaf of bread to re-secure the fan (regular fan screws wouldn't have worked unless they were secured with a nut) and had no issues thereafter, including with vibration. The last issue I recall was that the front fan died (it happens) and I had difficulty removing it. I don't remember how that turned out. But the case was 3 years old by then and had overall held up well and I had overall been satisfied with my purchase, but decided to get a new case, and was focused again on getting an Antec product. Overall: 3.75/5<br /><br />Antec Nine Hundred (2007) 4/5<br /><br />My second case was an Antec Nine Hundred, which I loved. However I got into the bad habit of tripping over peripherals plugged into the various front and back ports and destroyed a front USB port that way (as well as a couple gamepads). Over time a short developed in the front audio out port and I will wholeheartedly assume it is due to my abuse.In addition, like all cases, over time it just becomes harder to clean, harder to get at the little corners full of dust, and to really get things clean you may have to remove fans that are not so easy to get at. A long story made short I wanted to replace the Nine Hundred because my own stupidity hurt its functionality and it was getting old and dirty because my computer is on 24/7. I can't identify all of the specific little issues that negatively reflect on the Nine Hundred (such as the fact that the top 200mm fan wasn't fun to service), but in seeing how no dust is accumulating on the front of my One so far, I have to say that the Nine Hundred just got so filthy. Moving air is always good but there are consequences for that and one is dust. To be sure, I'd rather have a dusty, dirty case that is cool than a tidy case that is hot, but I'd much prefer the tidy cool case. I will admit that I used to smoke right next to the case (and lived with cats!) and that surely contributed but even when that wasn't true and it was clean as reasonably can be expected, six months or a year later it was again immensely, ridiculously dusty. Much more so than I remember my Lanboy being. Especially when using front intake fans and multiple HDDs. That was where most of the dust seemed to end up. Just caked on the HDD, HDD cage, and HDD front intake fans. Ugh. If you've read this far just realize that the only knock I have on this case at all from my usage is dust. It's quite possible that once I got it dirty with cat hair and smoke being sucked through the intakes as that I doomed the case to always being dirty given that it just moves to much air. If you feel that way, feel free to consider me to have rated it as well as any of the cases that follow to which I will give higher ratings.<br /><br />Antec Three Hundred (2011) 4.5/5<br /><br />Between that second purchase for myself and this most recent purchase for myself I built a computer for my dad with the Antec Three Hundred andit is partly the fact that the Three Hundred was inexpensive but of good quality (and clean!), in addition to reviews from tech sites that made me go with the One. If Antec hadn't released the One I probably would have gotten the Three Hundred Two (update of the Three Hundred). The only other case manufacturer that caught my eye was BitFenix and if the cost of the One is about what you want to pay and you want to look at other well-regarded options, check out what BitFenix has to offer.<br /><br />Other (Various)<br /><br />I have done other builds over the years (for others) for which I did not use an Antec case. Usually this was to save money or because a certain form factor was required that Antec did not quite meet satisfactory. In those instances, I found nothing remarkable about the case, but neither did I encounter substantial cons. While I definitely prefer Antec cases because of the features you get for the price, the build quality, and the aesthetic design (a big selling point with me as I think most manufacturers make ugly cases, most especially when they are trying to use creative designs, with a few exceptions), I can't say that there aren't other decent choices at or below the One's price point.<br /><br />Antec One (2012) 4.5/5<br /><br />I have only had this case a few weeks and the only reason I won't give it a 5 in my written review (though I will round up for the Amazon's star review) is because I can be more precise here and this case is not perfect. Dust filters would be nice, as well as expansion slots that can be removed and replaced rather than punched out, but those are minor concerns and Antec can't deliver all the features a user may want in a budget case. The features that are here--rails for drives, a location for mounting an SSD (which I do not use as the Nine Hundred pre-dated SSDs and did not have a slot--I ended up using velcro tape to mount it to the right side of the Nine Hundred and have done so in the One) are nice features, andthe build quality is nice, assembly was simple, and bonuses such as a USB 3.0 to 2.0 adapter are nice for those who don't yet have a motherboard with USB 3.0 support. I believe that a proper instruction manual doesn't ship with the case but is present on the website--however I did not need it. I have to say that so long as Antec (as well as its competitors) build cases of this quality and this feature-rich and sell them inexpensively I will prefer them rather than cases like the Nine Hundred (or its more updated models), which are 2-3 times as much.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br /><br />If you want a well-made, quality case for a low price and are smart enough to avoid cheaper cases with bundled power supplies, the Antec One is as good as any for your money. I highly recommend this case and bought one for someone else the month prior to my purchase (I was still trying to figure out if I wanted for myself the Three Hundred Two or the One, as well as trying to possibly get the one illusion [which is identical to the One except it has more 'bling' in the form of blue LED lights]), and they like their case and have no complaints as well. Funny story: She moved her hardware from her very old case to the One and said that something was wrong. I didn't much wonder if the case was defective and with good reason: turns out she decided to pretty much randomly connect the connectors for the front panel for the power button, reset button, and LED indicators as if they are all interchangeable. They aren't. After fixing the problem, everything was fine and she loves the case.

Well, yeah.<br /><br />So, look out for deals.  This set was on sale at a major national retailer beginning with Wal for tenbucks.  The LEGO landspeeder mentioned above we got at the same place for eighteenbucks.<br /><br />Enjoy!
1451695195|1.0|This book is a load of sh*t.  As a scientist, he should know that any claim should include evidence, physical and logical evidence.  His BS story of what he \\"dreamed' has nothing of the sort and is an embarrassment to science and the fundamental foundations of reason and logic.  There are hundreds of cases like this claiming the same thing, with NO evidence, just stories that can't be proven whatsoever.  This guy is making money off all you idiots...use your brain!!!  Understand what a scam this is!!!!

B000W1SSV0|5.0|With Bossa Nova already achieving worldwide popularity by the 1960's, the Latin jazz<br />subgenre from Brazil then took another international step when Stan Getz and Charlie<br />Byrd made there U.S. State Department to South America in 1961 when they set out<br />to discover the Bossa Nova.  After the return, the Bossa Nova had reached the United<br />States, as it resulted into the making of Jazz Samba, the highly praised landmark duet<br />album that topped the jazz and pop charts as introduce the subgenre to the American<br />public when it first came out in 1962.  Featuring a set of timeless compositions penned<br />by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Ary Barraso, the first rate track set features a solid record<br />of songs that begins with the chart-topping smash hit Desfinado, which procede with<br />Barraso's Bahia, Jobim's Samba De Uma Nota So (One Note Samba), O Pato (The Duck),<br />Samba Triste and E Luxo So.  Showcased with harmonic structures and it's beautifully-<br />crafted tone, Jazz Samba is a landmark masterpiece that will provide you with a superb<br />simultaneously warm full tone and a cool control of dynamics.  Thanks to the chemistry<br />of Getz, Byrd, Jobim and Barraso, their truly melodic inventiveness, romanticism, and<br />even the undercurrent of melancholy inherent in the music makes a revelatory classic<br />that will certainly remain as timeless as ever.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Awesome graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Very informative. I highly recommend supporting the developer for such a clean and simple app.
B006RCWJYA|5.0|With Stan Getz still topping the jazz charts with his rich tenor saxophone solos<br />  and charming charisma, he had teamed up with the great Oscar Peterson in 1957<br />  to record and release this robust uplifting duet classic that finds these two gentle-<br />  men of jazz giants in good company.  Stan Getz And The Oscar Peterson Trio is<br />  a delightful and refreshing masterwork done in expert timing that help showcases<br />  a cross combination for cool jazz, swinging melodies, jamming, soul, and passion<br />  they handle with care. Backed with a sprawling track set starting with their breezy<br />  take on Benny Goodman's I Want To Be Happy, the disc contains a set of superb<br />  takes of standards like Sunday, Three Little Words, Tour's End (a hopped up ver-<br />  sion of Sweet Georgia Brown), Detour Ahead and even a splendid Ballad Medley.<br />  In contrast, you get to hear original compositions penned by Getz himself such as<br />  Bronx Blues, I Was Doing Alright and the excellent closing track Blues For Herky<br />  (abetted with a choppy guitar solo and New Orleans-style vibe).  With Oscar's trio<br />  members Herb Ellis and Ray Brown providing their own guitar- bass background,<br />  the mid-tempo balladry gave Stan Getz And The Oscar Peterson Trio the interact<br />  edge it deserved, and clocking in around one hour it does deserves to have more<br />  attention focused not as one of Getz' greatest and most honoured duet sessions,<br />  but as a timeless world class collaboration between Getz and Peterson.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great break from the norm. Exciting and fun ride. History and fiction collide and land in a rubble of satisfying entertainment.
B000V63C4Y|5.0|While basking with the success of the duet classic Jazz Samba, Stan Getz<br />  scored another blockbuster hit with this duet masterpiece which he made with<br />  Joao Gilberto in 1963 that became one of Bossa Nova's greatest moments as<br />  well as Getz' crowning achievement.  Hailed as one of the biggest-selling jazz<br />  albums of all time, Getz/Gilberto had bought two of the Bossa Nova's greatest<br />  innovators: guitarist- vocalist Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim, to New<br />  York City for the making of the wonderful recording as the album resulted with<br />  pure magic.  Starting with the international hit single The Girl From Impanema,<br />  the lyrical track set features solid hits, including Corcavado, So Danco Samba,<br />  O Grande Amore, a new version of Desfinado and Vivo Sonhando, which they<br />  performed with such unassailable beauty.  Astrud Gilberto, who had made her<br />  cameo appearance on the session, said that her husband Joao informed Getz<br />  that she \\"could sing on the recording\\", while producer Creed Taylor recall that<br />  it took Getz' wife Monica to bring both Astrud and Joao Gilberto into recording<br />  studio (Mrs. Getz had the sense that Astrud could make a hit while he himself<br />  insisted on Astrud's presence).  Highlighted by plenty of uncanny material it is<br />  no wonder that the album was a colossal success, as the musicians performs<br />  with effortless grace and honour, which even gave this crowning achievement<br />  it's universal immortality as Getz and Jobim pulled off the harmonic perfection<br />  in a relaxed charm of it's own.  As the part of the Verve Master Edition Series,<br />  Getz/Gilberto will certainly ring out even more brighter as a timeless landmark<br />  from jazz history in greater form.
B00138KCC4|5.0|From beginning to end, this album is one of the best. It contains a nice fusion between rock and rap. Great album!!!!
B009A9ETFE|5.0|For the fans:<br />Valo and the boys have come up with a perfect way to keep our tastebuds wet until the 2013 release of Tears On Tape.<br />This is a terrific single disc retrospective of HIM's entire career up to this point. While most fans already have most of the songs on here, there is a very good new track at the top of the order, and a lot of these are what's being labeled as \\"Radio Edits.\\" So, they are at leaset versions of the songs that we dont have on the regular studio albums. Also, the track listing works nicely, as it isn't done in chronological order.<br />For the newby:<br />This is where you want to start! 19 of HIM's biggest hit songs and one blistering new Love Metal track, give one the ultimate opertunity to see what this band is all about. There is not a week song in the bunch, and these guys can pack a serious Rock/Metal punch! Crunchy riffs, fretboard frying solos, a pounding rhythm section, and the sultry, sexy, metal voice of one Ville Valo, add up to a Love Metal experience you wont get from anywhere else. Take the riffs of Sabbath, the sex of Zeppelin, the sleeze of hair metal, and a touch of molasses for the voice, and smash them all together, and you pretty much get HIM.<br />Buyer beware: If you're new to this band, the purchase of this CD will make you want to buy all their other albums. I kid you not. Because, while these songs are amazing in their own right, the real magic lies within the studio albums as full pieces of art. They are all simply brilliant. So please, be caseful with your wallet, and make sure you can still pay rent.

The story keeps you turning pages, the writing is clever, good character development and an interesting ending. Of course it is fiction but there is some reality in the story. I enjoyed this very much, it was a quick read. I give this one 4 stars.

1469984202|5.0|Reading this book as a fan of Japanese science fiction anime movies and books, especially the ones by Miyazaki Hayao, I visualized the claustrophobic setting of the book as somewhat akin to the crowded industrialized landscape in Laputa and the heroine somewhat like Nausicaa. Many of the reviews here advocate turning this book into a live action movie, but why not have it turned into an anime comic or movie, having the great director and artist Miyazaki Hayao and/or his protegees on board? While I don't see any evidence of plagiarism, I do see very similar threads of inspiration between this work and a lot of the works that Mr. Miyazaki has produced over the years. Mr. Miyazaki himself has acknowledged a lot of influence from American Sci-Fi authors, so I don't think that as an implausible connection.

1451695195|5.0|What humanity needs instead of going to Mars is to find a safe bridge to experience heaven or the threshold of heaven. There are scientists out there who can make this happen. A NASA to bring Heaven on Earth. To experience heaven, to clear up all the various holy books, to meet the true prophets of God, to meet relatives we never met before, to meet other living souls, perhaps all humanity on a universal pilgrimage in heaven temporarily. This would reveal our true purpose in this life individually and as a group. Imagine the music in heaven and revelations from the Creator which are direct and not filtered through prophets or religious hierarchies. Real experience would replace faith. We would truly be able to bring world peace with real leadership. No more Hitlers, Ayatollahs and gurus claiming they know the truth.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|Diana Krall is one of my favorite artists.  She has a \\"smooth as silk\\" voice.  The music and arrangements in this album are more suited to a performer with a raspy voice.  I missed hearing her piano arrangements and I really did not like the album photos.

B007KOYEOC|4.0|The reader needs to read this book, the third book in the trilagy beginning with Shades of Grey. The plot unfolds and one realises that the three books are not really about a  man with\\" sick\\" sexual desires but about a man molested in his youth and the resulting behaviour. The writer skillfully outlines the need for understanding and compassion so that the main character can lead a normal life. A must read.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|Or maaaybe that is just blood,<br />I cannot turn these down. Before I get used to them, let me tell you guys, these headphones are SUPER COMFY. I seriously can barely tell that I am wearing them they have a really large ear encirclement with a very thick pad covered in a very supple material, I would imagine it is to disperse pressure, there is also a shock absorbing kind of head adjustment vs the ones that click, It adjusts by itself.<br /><br />Now, about the sound quality.<br />It has slightly recessed bass, it does not need an amp, but I really recommend one, I purchased FiiO E11 just because of a promotional free battery + wall charger. Although, it is much smaller than I anticipated and that is great. With the amp the bass sounds very nice and I would say the clarity of these headphones are among the clearest I have ever sampled.<br /><br />Sound quality is affected by gear somewhat like so:<br />Bitrate (with these babys, you better be using flac) >/= headphones >/= source > amp (quality of, provided you have one)> interconnects<br /><br />Overall these are amazing headphones, I recommend buying them new, but a trusted refurbishing should be fine as well.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|The acting is fantastic.  I can understand why these two actors received awards, Claire did an outstanding job and she deserves many high praises for her part.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable and believable novel about a dark time in France's past. Their engerness to follow Germany's cruel persecution of the Jews should have been on a lot of people's consciouses. The decision a young girl made in terrible circumstances lived with her forever. It also changed and haunted the main character because of the depth of empathy she felt for her.
1409144720|5.0|It's a new day--or not.  John Rebus is back in harness, working for his old force, the Lothian and Borders Police, this time as a civilian in a Cold Case Unit.  His boss, DS Daniel Cowen, resents his posting as the only serving officer supervising a bunch of over-the-hill ex-cops, and Rebus gives him plenty of attitude, further nursing the man's aggravation.<br /><br />When Rebus is approached by a woman seeking information about her long-missing daughter, Rebus isn't sure he has anything to work with; she was eighteen, and a dozen years have passed since her disappearance and the original investigation.  There was little enough to go on at the time, and since then the original case officers have either died or retired.  But the woman points out that several other women have dropped out of sight over the ensuing years, and all in roughly the same region of rural Scotland.  She's convinced there is a serial killer at work.  His curiousity piqued, Rebus decides to look into the case; but with no real support from Cowan, and lacking even a warrant card, he's very much on his own.  So what else is new?<br /><br />Rebus is unaware that he's also in the crosshairs of another cop in Lothian and Borders.  DI Malcolm Fox heads Ethics and Standards, the current incarnation of Internal Affairs, and he's convinced that John Rebus is dirty.  He sets out to investigate the maverick copper, and it isn't long before he learns that Rebus has a more-or-less regular drinking partner, an ex-con known as Big Ger Cafferty.  Is Rebus passing inside information to the former crime boss?  To Fox, the issue is clear: \\"The force had spent generations tolerating and turning a blind eye to cops like Rebus... Rebus was the last.  He had to be convinced that his time was past.\\"  But is Fox after Rebus because he thinks Rebus is corrupt, or because Rebus reminds him all too much of his own failings?  And is Cafferty making sure he's seen palling around with the ex-cop in order to get revenge for Rebus's putting him away?  Before long Siobhan Clarke is drawn into the fray, steering an uneasy course between supporting Rebus and trying to keep him from further antagonizing all those around him, as she and John struggle to puzzle out their personal relationship.  Meanwhile, Cafferty plays a careful cat-and-mouse game with a local crime boss who took over his criminal ops while he was inside.<br /><br />Opening a new Rebus is akin to a heavy smoker peeling the cellophane from a new pack of cigarettes after going cold turkey for a month: you shake one out, put it to your mouth, light it and inhale deeply, savouring the aroma and letting the smoke work its way back to your throat and permeate your body.  You exhale, taking your time, and once again, you're hooked.  Rankin's latest will strike his fans much the same way, only without the guilt.<br /><br />The Rebus series has long been a benchmark for contemporary noir, and much of its appeal lies in Rankin's masterful use of layered sub-plots, Rebus's nuanced relationship with Siobhan Clarke, his taut alliance with former crime boss Big Ger Cafferty, and the tension between Rebus and the force--personified in the distrust Malcolm Fox has for him.  These elements are every bit as compelling as the main story line, and raise Rankin to the very pinnacle of crime writers.  His latest is very much up to the mark.

B003BWERF8|5.0|It works very fine with classic old iPod 2006, five points; easy to pair; volume and back-forward buttons work fine and respond immediately; great sound.<br />Cons: high power consume; it drains any Bluetooth headset battery in less of 2 hours.
0307477479|2.0|i don't know about this book.  i bought it because it received so many great reviews and accolades.  i was disappointed.  it seemed like the author wrote it purely in the hope that it would be produced into a movie/tv show one day...and it will be, so i've read.  the sentence structure is clunky and hard to follow.  the characters are affected and shallow.  the powerpoint section is absolutely retarded.  seems like the author got really lazy and made a huge chunk of the book a bunch of incoherent ppt slides.  LAME.
B0086700CM|3.0|I would not recommend this for anyone I love this game but this app it freezes up when you are trying to play and makes you die it very slow sometimes.often it doesn't turn or jump or anything I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR. ANYONE :(
1400032717|4.0|i have not yet met an autistic child or person so reading this book helped me understand an autistic person's thought process and phobias.  i found it very clever, insightful and bittersweet.  there were some parts that i found very funny and other parts that were very sad but still cute.  i recommend this book.  it's a very quick read.
1933952806|5.0|There are better more helpful detailed reviews, but I am so happy with this book I had to come on Amazon and give it 5 stars.  It is very detailed, but so much better than the manual.  He takes you step by step through what you should do when.  I have had an DSLR for three years and just purchased the D7000.  It sat in my bag for a couple of weeks because I could not begin to know how to use it.  I read some of the manual, but that was not great.  This author takes you step by step on how to set the camera up for all the functions.  Invaluable, thank you so much.  I can now use my camera.  I have the D5100 and thought it would be similar and I could get away with just reading the manual.  I was wrong.  This book was a life saver.
B003O86FMW|3.0|For some reason I found this book to be not as good as the first one. It might be that since the universe Collins presents on this one doesn't feel as fresh, or maybe because some of the plot ideas were easy to predict. The characters are revealed a bit more, but they don't evolve as much on this issue. The Games are huge part of the book, as in the first book, and is in that part of the narrative were one can feel to really enter the book and stand beside its characters. Overall it was an interesting reading, and would probably leave you \\"hungry\\" for the third one.<br /><br />Kindle format is superb, it was really formatted to fit the device.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This book was your classic Kay Scarpetta book.  I read fairly quickly, and actually keep you guessing to the final pages.

030759565X|5.0|This amazing cookbook arrived in the mail three days ago.  I've since made four recipes (Mushroom Bourguignon, Chocolate Chip Brioche Pretzels, Mustard Milanese with Arugula, Eggplant and Three Cheese Calzones) and they have all been outstanding!  I've been a follower of Deb's blog for over five years and have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of her cookbook.  There is some minor overlap in recipes (Mushroom Bourguignon for one), but the recipes from the blog that she picked to be included are so fantastic and few and far between that it is definitely worth it.  I'm planning on making two additional dinners from this cookbook (completely new recipes - not on the blog) this week alone!

Who in their right mind would start out on a hike of this magnitude without a \\"trial training\\" period?  She didn't read the manual before she starting her hike; nor did she even attempt to lift her backpack loaded with all her necessary hiking gear to gauge the weight, etc.  I am reading this book before I liked her previous book so much.  I just keep thinking there isn't any way she could hike alone.  I  will continue to read the book  to see if I can change my opinion of the truthfullness of this book
B009B2VBWE|2.0|I was quite let down when I listened to the \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" album expecting to hear the incomparable Diana and her incredible quartet (Anthony Wilson, Jeff Hamilton and John Clayton)transporting me to another dimension of exquisite jazz piano and guitar.  Diana's artistic freedom, however, should be respected enabling her to create and explore the nostalgic, honky tonk, cool sounds of the 1920s';i.e., \\"A Man is Not Worth the Salt of My Tears\\"; the country jazz feel of \\"A Little Mixed Up\\"; and the sentimental,lament of \\"Glad Rag Doll.\\"  Still, my heart yearns to hear another \\"Live In Paris\\" Diana's absolute best work - indeed.
B008G12EUY|5.0|Every Muse album seems to incorporate some new genre or style of music, and this album is no different. Bellamy experiments with dubstep and electronic music heavily in this album. I'm not really a dubstep fan, so songs like Madness and The 2nd Law: Unsustainable don't speak as strongly to me. However, beneath all the mastering, mixing, and embellishments are true Muse compositions. Songs like Big Freeze and Explorers have that distinct tone and message that only Muse can deliver. Chris Wolstenholm's contribution to the album are spectacular also. Save Me and Liquid State really provide contrast with each other, showing the bipolar moods Chris was probably feeling during his battle with alcoholism.<br /><br />Favorite songs have to be Big Freeze and Panic Station. One is cryptic, mysterious; another is straightforward and peppy. Both are catchy as hell.<br /><br />Buy!
1743117094|4.0|The Secret Keeper by Kate Morton is one of those kind of books that you anticipate as a \\"good thing\\" coming from a favorite author---a writer that knows you are just waiting for one of those giant tomes that you can muddle over for at least a week, comfortably fit into the time and place and readily identify with the angst of the main characters.  As such, this latest by Kate Morton, does not disappoint if you give it a chance and do not abandon it after the first few chapters.<br /><br />I say this because Morton's lead character placed in the timeslot of the present (2011), Laurel Nicholson, is a hard person to really get to know.  Sure, the reader is introduced to her as one of those quintessentially British actresses with the staying power of a Joan Plowright who can mold and shape herself into the likes of any Shakespearean, Dickensian or Austinian character.  The reader is told rather than feels the need to love her as a national treasure, unconditionally gushing about any comedy or tragedy into which this sort of actress devotes time and effort.<br /><br />However, as a person and a narrator, as the older sister of a clan of sisters watching their beloved mother's health fail and attempting to deal with her imminent death, Laurel seems driven by a mission; she is hell-bent on discovering her mother Dolly's big secret, relating from the first page a pivotal incident from her teenage years when her otherwise benign mother actually plunges a knife into an unwelcome visitor's neck resulting in his death.  Laurel serves as little else--a chronicler who reports her findings to the reader as she discovers them.  Morton presents Laurel as a woman in her 60s--accomplished, talented, revered and graceful.  However, she has no personal life other than that of divining her mother's past.  In this sense, Laurel acts only as the voyeuristic conduit to the era of the early 40s where her mother Dolly and her cronies battle through the Blitz in London, but as she has no other purpose, she seems wasted--minted only as the discoverer rather than having a more private and personal open-parenthesis of her own to close.  Indeed, she has puzzled over the mystery of her mother and the murdered man for over 40 years, but to truly endow her with a more faceted persona some denouement for herself besides the peace of her mother as she approaches her death is definitely necessary to make this character more engaging.<br /><br />Nonetheless, once the reader gets beyond the fact that Laurel technically just provides the glimpse into the past rather than catapulting him or her in a sub-story of self-growth, the history of the 40s Dolly, Jimmy and Vivian comes into focus as their perspectives are made known in the usual technique of alternating chapters where the reader moves backwards and forwards from one time slot to another as the intrepid Laurel uncovers more and more information from historic archives, interviews and attic rummaging.<br /><br />For the most part the structure works well--this reviewer far more enjoyed the recitation of Dolly's dreams and schemes during wartime London than the musings of Laurel over the breach of time.  However, when a third voice is added to the setup and Vivian, Dolly's friend and neighbor throws her two cents into the pot towards the end of the story, I thought Morton broke with her designated form and input an incongruous third opinion that weakened the interplay between Dolly and her Jimmy and the future observations of Laurel as Sherlockian sleuth.  Of course, Morton has her reason for including this insider's look into Vivian's mindset.  Nonetheless, technically, the duet of perspectives seems jarred by the inclusion of a third and perhaps, it should have been added from the start so that the reader could see a chronological progression instead of a seemingly red herring of counterpoint that Vivian's interjection brings.  Despite its clumsiness, Morton resolves this shift quickly as she brings her Blitz portion of the story to a close, continuing on in the future as Laurel finally uncovers the whole of the mystery with a rapidity like a snowball tumbling down hill gathering up the vital facts like snow picked up from its path.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Kate Morton writes an engrossing story for those who enjoy her genre of romantic/family historic/fiction of Rachel Hore ([[ASIN:0805094490 A Place of Secrets: A Novel]]), Katherine Webb, ([[ASIN:0062077309 The Legacy: A Novel]], [[ASIN:0062077880 The Unseen: A Novel]] and Kimberley Freeman ([[ASIN:1451623496 Wildflower Hill]]).  Unlike her best work, \\"[[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]],\\" \\"The Secret Keeper\\" asks for more time to be likeable.  Her lead character Laurel Nicholson has little to offer readers other than as their conduit into the past where the real story and its denouement take place.  Her other lead, Dolly, enigmatically seems agreeable for one moment and then like a chimera morphs into a two-dimensional cartoon that has one scratching his/her head in wonder as to the character's uncanny ability to deceive one's perception.  Morton's awkward structuring of this novel lends to a bit of further confusion that does lead to a pleasantly satisfying ending that underscores an \\"ah-ha\\" moment that happily makes itself known at the novel's climax and not excruciatingly beforehand.

B007V65R54|4.0|I had high hopes for this book. A book on forecasting by someone who has actually been successful at it-what could be better than that.<br /><br />===The Good Stuff===<br /><br />* Silver is a fairly honest writer. He is able to describe his previous forecasts, the methodology he used, and is frank with himself and the reader about what failed and what worked.<br /><br />* Unlike some other books on this subject, Silver comes across as actually understanding the theory behind probability, and knows how to apply it to everyday problems.<br /><br />* The material is chosen from a variety of topics, with different constraints and limitations. Chess, which is relatively deterministic but has a large number of permutations is very different that weather, which follows a few simple laws but requires intensive calculation to forecast. Silver explains how both of these create different challenges, and techniques for overcoming those problems.<br /><br />* He avoids the usual \\"bag of red and black ping-pong ball\\" nonsense that usually clutters up books on this subject, and his discussion of Bayesian probability analysis is first-rate.<br /><br />===The Not-So-Good Stuff===<br /><br />* I found the book a little tough to read. Silver writes well enough, but the material is presented in a much drier and more formal manner than other books such as Freakonomics. This is my major issue with the book. It is not a \\"mass market, fun to read\\" book, but neither is it a rigorous treatment of a mathematical subject. Rather it sort of languishes in a no-mans-land between the two. And for those of us who at least think we understand statistics, some of the passages in the book are frustrating as you try to decode what Silver is really talking about.<br /><br />* Silver has a bad habit of interjecting his own opinions and thoughts into the discussion. For example, his discussion of economic forecasting gets mired down in his own opinions on government spending levels and priorities. It takes away from the objectivity, and I know Silver knows better.<br /><br />===Conclusion===<br /><br />Even though it took me over a week to read this book, (a very long time for me), I enjoyed most of it. I did learn a few things about how forecasts work, and how to spot the difficulties in forecasting any given event. However it is more of a high-level look, and you will not learn much about how to actually forecast anything from this book.<br /><br />I would have preferred the book to either be more entertaining (Moneyball), or more \\"textbooky\\" rather than trying to be a little of both. In some ways, I think I would have enjoyed it more if I knew less about the math of statistics. Still, if you are at all interested in how complicated processes like weather, chess and national economies are forecast, it is well worth a read.es away from the objectivity, and I know Silver knows better.<br /><br />===Conclusion===<br /><br />Even though it took me over a week to read this book, (a very long time for me), I enjoyed most of it.

0312430000|3.0|Having been a huge fan of Gawande's work (Better, Complications, various magazine articles) when i stumbled on this title, the purchase was automatic. Sadly though, the work was a bit disappointing. The ideas presented make perfect sense and he brings strong arguments on their efficacy in the real world. The problem that I had with the book was that it just felt so repetitive in its content and presentation. I think the basic and most important ideas could have been edited down to a New Yorker length article and been just as effective.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I couldn't resist getting this case when Amazon offered it through Vine, even though I already have a case for my Kindle Fire, because it is so attractive.<br /><br />It is a firm fit for the Fire, not loose, holding the Fire securely. The cover is very fancy, a lovely design, and I really like the rich, deep-red color. It seems like some kind of expensive designer product rich people might buy, but it is priced reasonably for ordinary people on a budget.<br /><br />The Fire is held inside with elastic straps. They seem fairly durable, as does the cover itself. The cover closes well, and it bends back fully to allow access to the Fire when using it.

B0091THRCU|5.0|I get bored with my cases and I'm constantly replacing them. I currently have 6 new cases I purchased for my iPhone 5 and this one is by far the best constructed one I have. My iPhone fits securely and it's easy to get out with the release tab. When you have it in your hands you can appreciated the craftsmanship - super!. After work I go into shorts or sweats mode so I don't carry much with me. The Snugg has a pocket that I keep my debit card and DL with me without worrying if it fell out of my pocket. One concern I had was that my screen protector would get snagged and come off during the process of inserting/removing the phone - it hasn't and there aren't any signs that it will. Great product!

0060873175|1.0|This contains some minor spoilers, none of which the author doesn't already expose early on in the book.<br /><br />Having read many of Crichton's works and glancing at the rear cover teaser, I was excited to delve into this new story. From the get go, however, I immediately started thinking that Michael let his nephew's kid use his name to sell a book. This one literally reads at a 5th grade level, and it does so with no excitement whatsoever.<br /><br />Technology: Shrinking things to 1/10 their size yet retaining all their physical properties.<br /><br />Plot: A group of students of different disciplines who hang out and pursue their various degrees -- apparently in the same lab -- are given the proposition of doing research for a new biotech company. These main characters are shoved down our throats before the story starts with a list of their diverse areas of expertise, one of which is being a martial arts expert (great, that really adds depth to the character). Obviously they are shrunk and must survive to grow back. It's Timeline meets Jurassic Park meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids, all of which do way better than this.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />- The author does nothing with what could have been an incredible story.<br />- He throws out cliche suspense gimmicks left and right.<br />- The characters have no personality. Peter is empathetic and a leader (yeah, we get it, you don't have to keep telling us by how he likes to put his hand on everyone's shoulders)<br />- The author forgets he's the narrator, so characters often know what other characters are doing or thinking. For example, Drake knew specifically about the ants even though he never mentioned them earlier. Before that, it was just \\"dangers\\".<br />- He frequently jumps in as narrator and feeds the reader information out of the blue.<br />- Half of the book is repeating the obvious or something that had already been said (they were tired, they decided to sleep, they slept). He does this all the time.<br />- Many sections/encounters have a deux machina.<br />- The insect fights have no imagination.<br />- The excessive gore adds nothing and in fact detracts from the plot.<br />- The portrayal of the bad guy is so caricature, it's less believable than the shrinking technology.<br />- The excessive use of anthropomorphism comes across as a veiled ecological statement, not a story feature<br /><br />I lasted, I really did until almost the end, whence I put the book down, since it was obvious any ending couldn't make up for the rest. I made it as far as I did by folding every page where I had to do a double take (20 in all), here's a couple...<br />- \\"This happened to stations occasionally. The weather was hard on them, because they were so small.\\" (duh)<br />- \\"Rick was not a reflective person. He rarely thought about himself. He did now.\\"<br />- \\"'Nothing to worry about as long as you know the structure of the web.' 'But, I'm a beetle person,' Erika answered.\\" (after a close call with a spider)<br />- \\"Ben Rourke was a mysterious character. How had he ended up here? How had he avoided death from the bends? Rick tested his limbs, rubbed his arms. He was covered with bruises, he could see them in the light. At least he could move. He wondered how much time he, Karen, and Danny had before the bends started to affect them, make them sick?\\" (then, after a brief description of the surroundings...) \\"Karen and Rick both glanced at their hands and arms, and noticed the bruises there. It would be a good idea to persuade Rourke they needed to leave for Nanigen soon; or to learn from him how he had beaten the bends.\\" (redundant/terrible pacing)<br />- \\"'People like Vincent Drake operate outside the bounds of normal morality. Their evil can become invisible to normal people, because normal people can't believe anyone would commit such evil.'\\" (jack-of-all-trades Rourke explaining the psychology behind psychopaths)<br /><br />I'm sorry, Mr. Crichton, you made a serious errorallowing this to see daylight. minus 1 star.

B004HX4RT6|5.0|This one is just well done. Simple but that's what chess should be. Keeping it simple and straight forward means this should run well on just about any device still in service. File size isn't bad at all either. An elegant and simple classic. AI is nothing to scoff at though I'm not exactly a master. All and all I'd say it's absolutely worth grabbing if you like or want to learn chess.

B007REV4T8|4.0|Skyfall in IMAX was a blast. You should all know, however, that this movie was not originally shot with IMAX cameras, it was converted after the fact. The result was still amazing though. While not as crystal clear as movies actually shot on IMAX, we still get to see 26% more of the original captured footage. The IMAX experience of Skyfall was definitely worth it, with the huge picture and extremely loud and immersive surround sound.<br />From all the reviews out there already, I was expecting this Bond to go a little deeper emotionally, psychologically, and historically into Bond and M's back-stories. You do get a little new material as far as the characters are concerned though. Instead, we get a really good action movie. I appreciated that Skyfall had a slower, more in-control pace unlike Quantum of Solace which, while enjoyable, was just action scene after action scene. The action in Skyfall ranges from fast and chaotic to slow and jazzy like an old school spy movie. I did notice that there was a serious lack of shakey camera movement. For several of the fights you can actually tell who is hitting who and what kind of moves they are doing. It was refreshing.<br />The cinematography was beautiful and took advantage of all the filming locations. The surround sound was exciting. And the music had its own touch while throwing in deliciously generous bouts of the original Bond music. There are several nods to older Bond movies that were fun to discover and at the same time the movie fits in perfect with Craig's other two outings as 007 with his same character continuing to grow and learn.<br />The main bad guy wasn't too scary in my opinion. His quirks almost make you like him. He is definitely evil, but I was never really afraid of him. He did an amazing job and was a different take, so that was nice.<br />Last but not least, how is this movie content/parental concern-wise? It deserved the PG-13 rating it received. Going into Skyfall I was a bit nervous about all the sex scenes and opening music sequence that Bond movies always have. The sex scenes were basically what you see in the trailers with just a few more seconds of footage. The opening musical credit sequence also was not that bad, you definitely don't see as much as in other Bond movies. There were a few outlines of obviously naked women, but they were brief and not that detailed.<br />As Far as violence is concerned, it was PG-13 spy violence with lots of gunshots and punching and explosions etc. Nothing too graphic here. (No naked torture scenes like in Casino Royale).<br />And there was one \\"F-word\\" which was actually not that clearly uttered. Other than that, the rest of the swearing was far below normal PG-13 par.<br />Thanks for reading, now go enjoy another awesome Bond movie!

B005ES0YKO|5.0|I carefully read reviews of sizing of Keen and Croc shoes purchased on Amazon. Sizing especially with online orders is the most important aspect as this can lead to returns and exchanges that requires time from Amazon and the consumer. For me, the length of the back strap of Crocs Duet Sport is the reason why I have to go one size up . . . this issue is also present with Crocs Crocband. As for comfort, this is the MOST cushy of Crocs and I have several (Original, Beach, Specialist, Crocband, Mercy, Cloud) and was encouraged by other reviews of the more durable sole. I am a size 10 in shoes and typically take a size 10 womens/8 mens in Crocs but will have to order 1 size up in the Crocs Duet Sport. I wish it was offerred with only holes on top as this would limit amount of debris that can enter the shoe if walking on a trail.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|The fit, finish, and construction of the watch are superb for the price, it's a great value. I was looking for a rugged ever day watch that looked nice and could take a beating, this fits the bill and doesn't break the bank. The band however is somewhat cheap. I would recommend looking into either the Seiko super jubilee bracelet, or the Seiko super oyster bracelet. Both of these can be found on Amazon (and elsewhere). They are solid bracelets but with hollow end links. On eBay you can find either Seiko super bracelet with custom made solid end links added to them for about $90. I purchased one of those (jubilee) and am still into the watch less then $300. I believe that for the money the band watch set is the nicest looking best value around for a rugged dive watch.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|We purchased this book for our dyslexic daughter. We got the Kindle because it would read the books to her.  This one wouldn't read and we didn't realize we had to look for that when we bought a book. In essence that isn's fair to say we hated the book because she wasn't able to \\"read\\" it.  We did contact Kindle and find that we had to look for text-to-speech when we purchase a book.

0743297334|3.0|You'd think that a story centered on a Eunuch who loves a sexually liberal woman would be enjoyable, but it's not. Hemmingway's first novel, The Sun Also Rises, is anticlimactic and uninteresting, however his writing style is a treat, which leads me to the conclusion that although Hemmingway had a talent for writing effective sentences, at this point in his career he hadn't quite become a good storyteller.<br /><br />The story brought the reader along on a ride of people with money, no morality to drive them, too much time on their hands and a bordom of what to do with themselves. So the story is essentially made up of the characters going to clubs, and restaurants, arguing/joking in a drunken stupor and then eventually deciding to go do the same thing during the bullfights in Spain. That may sound interesting but in Spain it's the same story, they do nothing new, and there is no climax. The only thing close to a climax is that Brett cheats on Michael with another man, but the way he describes their interaction is dull and he doesn't present it in a way that hooks you. It was way too obvious and you knew it was coming.<br /><br />As for the writing, there is a lot to learn from. In some ways it shows how impactful terse sentences can be. There were times when I was caught off guard by the imagery that came to mind through his simple statements, but that can only be appreciated for so long. The long descriptions of Spanish countryside for instance made an already slow story come to a complete halt.<br /><br />So to sum it up, the story is slow and nothing that anyone in LA or modern times hasn't seen a million times over. The one thing I find interested is that I didn't realize that society then was so similar to society today: so hopeless, hedonistic and foolish in nature. Let me put it this way, if you aren't looking to be entertained, but would like literary insight on creating terse, yet impactful sentences, then this is the book for you. The book is a piece of history in Hemmingway's career when he hadn't quite found something interesting to say, but it's interesting none-the-less because of the way he says it.

B0097AQEOK|5.0|This is not a review, although I plan to write one as soon as I have received my copy of this box. What I am offering here is a short explanation of what is included in the box.    According to Joni's official web site, the box includes a full set of remasters (done by Rhino) for all the LPs recorded before she switched to Geffen records. Each CD comes in a miniature record sleeve, (instead of a jewel box) replicating the original packaging (in the same style as the Beatles remasters).    Several folks have complained that the lyrics on the CD sized jackets are too small a type size for older eyes to read but since the jackets are a duplication of the original sleeves, this is to be expected.    The box was released on Oct 29th, 2012 - a few days before Joni's birthday.    You can read the blurb on Joni's site here:  [...]    it includes a link back to this page on Amazon so you'll know you're buying the \\"right\\" product!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that she doesn't specify the length of the finished items and I hate doing the math.

B000784WMW|5.0|I have seen many Jane Eyre movies and while none are without pluses and minuses I feel that Julian Amyes' 1983 TV series is the one Charlotte Bronte would like best.<br /> Zelah Clarke gives a subtle but powerful performance as the quiet, reserved, sweet governess Jane and displays a strong sense of courage and integrity. She is well matched by Timothy Dalton as the multi-layered hero/villian Mr. Rochester who arouses her feelings by making her jealous of a shallow snotty aristocrat named Blanche Ingram. (well played by Mary Tamm) He cries, shouts, laughs and cavorts around with energy and flair in whatever scene he is in. The scene where he begs her to stay after she discovers the truth about Bertha still gives me the chills--Man! She had willpower.<br /> The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent--even the lunatic was good. Costumes and sets are sumptuous. Alexander Baron's screenplay is rich with layers of details in all four phases of Jane's life: Gateshead, Lowood, Thornfield and the Rivers.<br />Five stars? You better believe it.
1451620829|4.0|Let me preface this by saying I have been a lifetime KISS fan.  I've read most of the KISS material out there and Peter's story fills in a lot of holes which I always suspected was propaganda from Gene and Paul.  Peter doesnt hold anything back on anyone from the guys in the band to the great Bob Ezrin, producer on Destroyer and Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\".<br /><br />The way the book reads is as if he was telling you his story at his kitchen table and is brutally honest about others and himself...especially his own screw ups.  Some reviews say he is saying everything that went wrong for him he blames on others.  That is not the way it reads to me.  It starts out at the lowest point of his life when he is contemplating suicide and develops into a great story of the highs and lows of his life upto this point.  He is brutally honest about how he squandered away his KISS money on drugs and excess and also how he was screwed over by people who trusted implicitly while taking responsibility for allowing it to happen.  It is a great rags to riches to rags and back to riches again from a guy who had no education and came from nothing.  He is now a man who has survived male breast cancer, has a happy third marriage, and gives back to the community to the point where he is recieving a humanitatian award from the American Cancer Association.  Books from the other guys in KISS all were about sleeping with a thousand women or some ghost writer's interpretation of drug jokes.<br /><br />Overall, it is the most honest sounding rock bio I have ever read and debunks a lot of the KISS mythology about how some of their concepts were developed.  Once you pick it up, you will read it till you are done because of the style and completeness of its thought.

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It is abridged, I think, but for a free download, it's a great, short read.  You still get the story and Twain's witty, engaging voice is not removed.  My favorite part about the book is the dialogue between characters.  The old-style speech is really fun to read - I wish we still spoke that way!<br /><br />Here are a few examples of what I mean:<br /><br />\\"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't.  All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's ever so nice - I wish I could draw.\\" \\"It's easy,\\" whispered Tom, \\"I'll learn you.\\"

B009NQKPUW|5.0|Loved this film. Same type of supense factor as Alien. I will say if you enjoyed Alien, you will like this. Has a good cast and well written. A must have for any blu-ray library. If you purchase the 4 disc collector's edition, the only way you can download to itunes is from the DVD/Digital copy disc. Once it's in the DVD drive you NEED to open the disc manager. It will open a new window with a new code to use for itunes. If you use the code on insert in the disc packaging IT WILL NOT WORK. The code on the insert only works with UltraViolet. Fox needs to get with it. Make it easy for the consumer!
B0013O123Q|1.0|I read many of the reviews of this film (both for and against) before I decided to view it myself. I watch a movie in the hope that it has some degree of entertainment value.  Sometimes I am well entertained and others not quite so much.  Unfortunately, this movie fell into the latter category. If I have to struggle for comprehension of the story line then I am not being entertained.  Sure there was a bit of gratuitous sex and a bit of violence all portrayed in very graphic form but for what purpose?  The camera work looked like something produced by someone who had indulged in the use of an halucinogenic drug.  Perhaps if I had been using the same, it may have made some sense.  Obviously, films of this type will appeal to a small niche group who could probably see the beauty in the leaves on a tree in a forest during a 100 mile per hour hurricane.  For those who consider this film(and others like it) as entertainment, fine, but sadly it's not for me. As for the entertainment value of this film, personally, I think watching wet cement go dry would be far more exciting.
0446580848|4.0|Wow... someone does not like Yemen - or the Middle East for that matter.  Setting that aside for a moment - the book was just above average for me.  I LOVE the John Corey character, and Paul Brenner too.  I was excited (at first) to see them together in a book.  But my excitement began to wane as the story continued... there is very little action in the middle 300 pages of the book.  Those pages are dedicated to a running negative commentary on arab culture - hilarious and scathing. I found it very funny and spot-on, but still kept wondering when the action would kick in. It finally starts to pick up in the last 150 pages - and ends well, with some of the key characters set to return in a future book.  I look forward to that, and hope the next one has more action to balance out the witty Corey commentary.
B00932A2MC|3.0|This was a decent movie.  The previews that you see for this movie pretty much sum up all the action scenes.

159420411X|5.0|This book explains the unerring accuracy for Nate SIlver's election predictions using Bayesian statistics. The BEST part of the book for me was that I finally understand Bayes' analysis.  I  used quite a few sophisticated statistical tools in my work (retired as reliability physics expert for semiconductor devices, aka chips), but I was never able to grasp Bayes Theorem until now.  Wikipedia's \\"tutorial\\" was far too complicated even for a PhD, but Nate provided a simple version that a layman can understand ... and he did it using a hilarious example (look for \\"cheating\\").  In fact, I am so impressed with Bayes' analysis that I am thinking about writing a corollary to my two best technical papers grafting a Bayesian view.<br /> Returning to the election prediction issue, consider that each poll of 1000 people has a sampling error of +-5%, easily derived from Poisson statistics. However, when one pools the results from say 25 polls (and removes bias), the sample size is increased by 25-fold, which reduces the sampling error by 5-fold, down to +-1%.  Thus, one can make confident predictions over differences FAR smaller than the usual sampling error.  When one combines Bayesian pooling with a state-by-state analysis, one can make astonishingly accurate predictions ... Nate predicted ALL 50 states correctly, so his electoral count was exactly on reality as well when fractional electoral counts are eliminated.<br /> Buy the book as it is educational and fun to read.

B00979CS50|1.0|Unnecessarily long tracks. The skills of Neil Young as songwriter seem to have vanished in recent times. From Prairie Wind no really good songs on any of their albums. The last one wite  Crazy Horse, the recent \\"Americana\\", was probably the worst of all his career. Some kind of sick joke.<br />Here, compositional gaps seem want to be supplemented at the expense of the length of the themes that are just deadly.<br />A long trakc, with the typical instrumental developments of Crazy Horse, at a concert or in the middle of an album with other smaller items often enhance their effect, but here, listening to all the long songs together only produces boredom.<br />At this point, you can not ask Neil to \\"discover the wheel\\", but, at least, can not be asked to keep it wet.<br />This doesn't mean that this album was bad. It's only completly unnecessary.<br />Sometimes you have to know when  to fade away.

0871404133|4.0|In The Social Conquest of Earth, Wilson expounds upon the theories that were set forth in his classic work Sociobiology. His main thesis is that group selection, not kin selection, drove evolution and helped us to develop societies. He compares the way human society developed to the way ant \\"society\\" developed (ants are his specialty). He suggests reasons why religion and xenophobia would have originally developed as protective characteristics of groups. This book covers a large swath of material...from ants to human prehistory, to history, to today. I think he did a pretty good job organizing the book considering what a wide topic he was covering. His theories were clear and for the most part convincing. I think Wilson is an atheist, but he did a pretty good job of stating his opinions in an agnostic sort of way to avoid insulting the faithful. I think the book was well-written, interesting, and approachable by a non-scientific audience. I had no issues with Hogan's narration--he read the book well, but it wasn't anything worth raving about.

B005LAIH2W|3.0|John Carter(released Mar/12)stars Taylor Kitsch as John Carter,Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris,and many others.Think Dune meets Star Wars and you will see a film here that thinks epic but fails,because of its over attention to detail and the inordinate amount of time it takes to tell this enormous tale(I found myself clock watching numerous times-never a good sign).This story ideally would have been better off told in segments ala Star Wars.Edgar Rice Burroughs original stories really deserve a more detailed look filmicly speaking.<br />The story starts out with Carter,a former Confederate soldier and now seeming archeologist,dodging someone on his tail to send a telegram.Next thing we know he is dead and his  nephew Edgar(as in E.R.Burroughs)is attending the reading of the will.His uncle is entombed in a crypt that can only be opened from the inside`,and much of the estate money will go to see that it is never disturbed.<br />First off Edgar reads his uncles diary which begins back in the late 1800s in the Arizona territory(which in turn begins the main Carter storyline).He is there searching for a legendary cave of gold,which he eventually finds.However a strange being beams into the cave and the two struggle.With his dying breath the being utters some strange wording and a medallion that Carter picked out of his hand,suddenly sends him instantaneously to Mars.<br />He has not a clue as to where he is(this takes quite a while to learn)and finds,due to the lack of an Earth-like gravity,that he can jump enormous distances.However he runs into a race of beings similar in stature to Jar-Jar Binks,but with a smaller head,two small tusks and four arms.They take him back to their encampment.One day a princess from the city of Helium comes into contact with Carter.She tells him that her city and the others on Mars(Barsoom to folks there) are at war and that it has not gone well for her people.She is being forced to marry the commander of the opposing forces in order to achieve peace.Carter of course falls hard for the princess and helps her.<br />Carters main objective all along has been to get back to Earth,and to that end they journey to the scared place of his captors.There they come upon the answer,but which the princess denies,telling Carter she needs more info from her city.It is an obvious lie to keep Carter there.After their visit both are captured and the princess is returned to her husband to be to be married.The princess tells Carter about her lie and tells him he can go back anytime he wants,and says the appropriate words.When the wedding party interrupts their talk,she turns and Carter is gone.She assumes he has gone back,but he has just jumped up onto a ceiling alcove.<br />Over and above all of the strife on Mars,there is a higher race of beings manipulating the outcome of every battle,and are so bold as to even introduce themselves to Carter.Carter in turn enlists the help of his original captors to go against Helium`s enemies.A gigantic battles ensues and in the end the citizens of Helium are free, and Carter and the princess wed.One night shortly after,one of the higher race of beings sends Carter back to Earth.Carter wakes up on the floor of the cave he was originally transported from.It seems a copy of your body is only sent from one place to the next.If something were to happen to the original,the copy would die.Carter returns home and for years searches for another cave with another medallion in order to return to Mars,but in vain.So he fakes his death(we saw at the beginning of the movie)which lures out one of the higher beings.As his nephew is about to open the vault,the being comes out of the bushes to kill him,but Carter jumps him from behind and dispatches him.Carter`s nephew and Carter re-unite,but just briefly.Carter tells his nephew to look after his body and returns to the vault and Mars,his adopted home.<br />There is just so much information to digest throughout this movie as one race comes into the picture,another pops up,then later another which look exactly like the first ones,and on and on.What really threw me off was when Carter first came in contact with his original captors,neither could understand each other.In his captors camp later,everyone is speaking perfect English.There is no explanation as to why the sudden change,except to have Carter remark that he can suddenly understand them.The beginning where Carter is being followed then suddenly he is dead and a will is being read,I thought could have been done better.Sure it all ties back to the beginning at the end,but for a while there at the start,you don`t know whether you were looking at a flashback when Carter is running around and his death is the present,or is it the reverse...it is just unnecessarily confusing for the start of a film like this.The film is epic in style,to be sure,but with all this detail being thrown at you and the hopping back and forth from one sub plot to another,is does get a bit overwhelming,and annoying.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 2:40:1 w/s a/r.The only extras are commentary and a featurette on its making.<br />All in all an overly detail-oriented showboat that tries to look Star Wars-ishly epic-like,but fails to deliver the goods,in this overly long juggernaut.ture,another pops up,then later

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A story about the contrasting lives of a brother and sister left on the steps of an orphanage long ago in Ireland and how it's discovery helped a young lady, generations later, make important decisions in her life.<br /><br />It depends on what you like to read and why, but I enjoyed reading the Kindle edition at a bargain price. Given the opportunity will, again, read work written by the author without hesitation.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Both of my kids enjoyed their new Nerf guns. The gun shoots fast and please be careful because they are more powerful than previous Nerf guns.
B009SJ46EA|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I've heard many complaints that this season isn't as good as the first, but I think it's awesome. I don't think this season can even be compared to the last one because it is so different. If you like weird shows, you should check this out.
0060512806|3.0|I started and stopped and restarted and stopped this book over a period of a couple years just trying to slog through it.  I love history; I like math; I can enjoy a long narrative.  If I had to choose a part of the book that I liked, I would say the parts of the novel about Bletchley Park and Bobby Shaftoe's commando missions in WW2 were interesting and I found myself skipping pages to get back to those story threads.  But just about all the rest of Crypto was a total snooze-fest.  I can't see myself reading anything else in the Baroque Cycle.
B0061Q13V2|3.0|Easy to read. Often repetitive. More a story about Dominique's experiences growing up in a traditional, often hostile Romanian household and with various coaches. Much more interesting than I thought it would be considering I'm not really into gymnastics! Pretty inspiring read that will have you raising your eyebrows at times.

0399157565|1.0|What a dissapointment her last few books have been.  Same old same old. I wasted my money on this one.
0446581356|3.0|Covers a lot of topics, but IMHO, the more, the less informative. I wouldn't call it a manual for beginners to pro, in which one would learn exact applications. Sections for every facet of make-up, though sparse. Even a few pages for photographers, wanna-be make-up artists, magazine work, you name it. A lot of self-promotion photos for the author/artist. Really not enough content to be useful, but offers a bit of insight for beginners or teens. Pros can pass on this.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This is such an enjoyable film, that after watching it I wanted start it over again! I bought a copy for myself and one for my parents. I can't wait to watch it together when I visit for the holidays. It's the kind of movie you want to share with others. It's funny and touching, you can't help but cheer Arthur on his journey. Finally, I'm glad to have a new classic to add to my list of films I watch Nov.-Christmas. More like this please!
B004HX4RT6|2.0|I would rate higher but AI can never prevent a checkmate victory after 5 moves. Left pawn up two, knight over 3, rook to g7, bishop insert, and queen hammerdrop. This move combination has not been stipped even with most difficult AI. This review may be not very helpful to some more amateur users but I encourage you to google the movesets.
0061537969|5.0|Our family just loves this book! One goes through life with Enzo and can't help but laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time. This book is good for all ages, except there might be some explaining to do about the facts of life to younger children. Have recommended to many who have purchased and read it and expressed the same wonderful feelings about the book. Thank you for this wonderful gift.
B004AQR24W|2.0|I had higher hopes since I really enjoyed \\"Red\\" with Bruce Willis, which has a similar sort of older action hero back in action kind of story. There is no comparison.  I suspect the writing was done by a 12 year old boy. It's predictable, and cliche, and lame, and sometimes cringe-worthy. I just cringed while thinking about it. Most of the action sequences are too choppy and hard to follow.  There were a few exciting action bits. If there was a bright spot, it was Jason Statham. I didn't even know who he was before I watched this film. His fight scenes were probably the most entertaining and well done.  I was originally drawn in by the \\"old school\\" cast and really wanted to like it, but it is so very bad.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Love this DVD! The music, lyrics, story line, sets, costumes and performances. To me, this is the ORIGINAL! I understand that this is not the Broadway production with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, which I saw on stage twice, but this CD is pretty good. There are other Phantom's out there with gory telepathic rats(which I was not prepared for),some black and whites with old actors, other countries performances, and partial performances such as excerpts from Andrew Lloyd Webber. Be aware that this one is Wide Screen and may not work on some DVD players. If you have viewed this, be sure and watch the new sequal in 2012 titled LOVE NEVER DIES!Butler is the Phantom in that also. The theme song, Love Never Dies, is outstanding in its lyrics, music, costumes, sets, and performance.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I don't understand why there are some readers who were disappointed with the book, to me it was well crafted. Definitely up there with the best.

B0007LXPBI|5.0|I remember seeing this film on PPV in the fall of 1998, and I enjoyed every second of it. Until 2007, I had a crush on Lindsay Lohan (this was her film debut, no doubt). I personally like this version better than the 1961 original to be honest, probably because I saw this one first and it came out during my generation. Brings back some good memories of when Lohan was a good actress and wasn't a law-breaking druggie. I watch this film a lot whenever its on TV, but since I have this Special Edition, I can watch it anytime I want. A good remake! 5 out of 5.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This book provides a great summary of habits and philosophy about money of those who can and do build wealth, and those who don't. Now when I make decisions about money, even a mundane purchase - makes me think - I'm taking a well-paved road, and I know exactly where it leads. Which road do I want to take, to wealth or to hopes about wealth? After all, walking on the well-paved road, taking the same steps that others took while being on that road but hoping to arrive elsewhere is a delusion. This book make me rethink my habits and gave me strategic ideas about future. Thank you!

B008VNIA32|1.0|This is a review of the BLURAY. This appears to be an upscale of the standard def video to bluray. It doesn't look like hidef, and there are video glitches and artifacts in the picture. The 5:1 sound appears to be a simple process of the stereo track on the DVD with almost no rear channel info. If you already have the DVD set, YOU DON'T NEED THIS BLURAY. Kultur should be ashamed of foisting off a ripoff like this. I want my money back.

B0067LPVCI|5.0|Before the making of this, their second album (RCA Victor LPM/LSP 3766), original Jefferson Airplane drummer Alexander \\"Skip\\" Spence had departed sometime in 1966, replaced by Spencer Dryden, and former vocalist with San Francisco's The Great Society, Grace Slick, had joined that same fall as their new lead vocalist, thereby giving this quintessential psychedelic rock band a decidedly different sound.<br /><br />Released in February 1967, and quickly finding favour in California's counter-culture movement, it soon reached # 3 on Billboard's album Top 200 and by July had gained gold status. It also produced two Billboard Pop Hot 100 singles - their first on those charts - and one near-miss. The results of their initial single, My Best Friend, were not exactly encouraging as the best it could do early in 1967 was a # 103 on the Hot 100 Bubble Under charts b/w How Do You Feel? on RCA Victor 9063.<br /><br />But then came one Grace had cut with The Great Society in 1966 on North Beach 1001 called Someone To Love, penned by her brother-in-law Darby Slick. Changing the title to Somebody To Love, it became their best hit ever in their guise as Jefferson Airplane as it peaked at # 3 Hot 100 in April/May 1967 on RCA Victor 9140 b/w She Has Funny Cars. That was followed in July by the # 8 Hot 100 White Rabbit on RCA Victor 9248 b/w Plastic Fantastic Lover. These would be the only two times they'd crack the Top 10 as Jefferson Airplane, although they'd do it six more times as Jefferson Starship/Starship, including two # 1s in the 1980s.<br /><br />Lingering controversy over whether or not Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia had a hand in the album continues unabated, but on the reverse cover RCA prints \\"Jerry Garcia, musical and spiritual adviser\\" among the credits - something always denied by album producer Rick Jarrard. In any event, Rolling Stone magazine lists Surrealistic Pillow at # 146 on their \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\\"<br /><br />At the time the band consisted of: lead guitarist/vocalist Jorma Kaukonen; vocalist/guitarist Marty Balin; lead vocalist/pianist Grace Slick (also organ and recorder); rhythm guitarist/vocalist Paul Kantner; Jack Casady on bass, fuzz bass and rhythm guitar; and drummer/percussionist Spender Dryden.<br /><br />The tracks, with writers shown in brackets, are:<br />Side 1<br />1.

Happy that Marino is still taking care of himself. At times he is a teddy bear who impersonates a grizzly bear.  Benten and Kay still have their differences which make them seem real.  Kay still making delicious things to eat.

B009AJD5E0|4.0|This was a good start to the Alien series and left enough \\"story\\" to make several more \\"in between\\" movies.  It was to bad the film studio didn't couple the release of the movie with a re-releaase of the movie Alien.  Would have made more sence to a lot of new viewers, and spiked the interest of us old folks that saw Alien when it first came out back in the late 1979.  I has caused me to go back and look at Prometheus in Alien, and there are some inconsistencies, or maybe they are new plot/story lines yet to be hatched.  In general, the acting was good, action, good, but not the heart pounding excitement of watching Alien for the first time.

Grabbing you at the very start, with the global experience, he uses the ails of his ancestral land and people to shine a mirror on all of us. It is not his or their but our survival.<br /><br />Able to stand toe-to-toe to great jazz, classical, rock, hip-hop with it's complete and even at times imperfect resonance, a testament to the heart of all of us.

Besides it will probably update soon. I am expecting an update before Christmas. It may get cheaper later but I know that was 7 dollars well spent.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This movie was ok.  I love Alien movies and maybe had too high of expectations for this movie.  I think it may be the type of movie that needs to be watched multiple times in order to catch everything.  The movie was entertaining but was confusing at times.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I have heard Rod Stewart attempt to sing songs from the decades before rock took over the pop charts. I say attempt because it fell flat in my estimation. Paul McCartney on the other hand is actually pretty good at this. He's no Frank Sinatra, but Frank would never be able to sing Live and Let Die if he wanted.<br /><br />Paul sings in a softer, often higher voice than I would have expected. That takes a little getting used to. On some songs I might have suggested a different key for Paul. As others have said, the backup and arrangements are tops. I would have enjoyed more instrumental soloing from this band, given the caliber of the talent, but the producers no doubt insisted the focus should be on the singing.<br /><br />Not every track is a success. Bye Bye Blackbird sung at a dirge-like tempo may be unique, but Ringo Starr's version (on his Sentimental Journey album) is actually more effective. Paul wrote two originals for this album, and while My Valentine is nicely crafted, the lyrics to Only Our Hearts are pretty bad. (That is unfortunate, as the music was wonderful.)<br /><br />The standout tracks for me, the ones I thought Paul interpreted most effectively, are Home, More I Cannot Wish You, My Valentine, Always, and Inch Worm.<br /><br />Another two, which I enjoy immensely, were left off the standard issue of the album, and are available only on the Deluxe Edition sold exclusively in Target stores (though it is available on amazon at an inflated price). Baby's Request is one of those old-timey sounding numbers that Paul used to write from time to time (Honey Pie with the Beatles, You Gave Me The Answer with Wings). Originally Baby's Request appeared on Paul's generally rocking Back To The Egg album. Here it gets the classy treatment it deserves. It's not a great song, but very fun, and performed perfectly here. The last exclusive track on the Deluxe album is My One And Only Love. When I first heard it, I could not believe this fantastic performance/arrangement was left off the standard issue of the album. One And Only Love may be McCartney's best vocal of all the sessions for this album. If you need a reason to go to the store and buy the Deluxe edition, for me, this is it. There are two Deluxe editions available just to make things confusing, so make sure the one you buy has Baby's Request and My One And Only Love as the final two tracks (16 tracks total).<br /><br />In spite of a few songs that really don't appeal to me, there are enough winners to justify four stars. If you love McCartney and the kinds of standards that Sinatra used to sing, there's no reason not to add this to your collection. Without the Deluxe tracks I mentioned, I would not be quite as enthusiastic, though the standard 14-track release is still a decent collection.ment was left off the standard issue of the album.

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I went and saw this in theaters twice. First, I saw it in 3D, then I went back the next day and saw it in regular 2D. Not only that I really like the movie, but I really like the song from Pitbull. It's called \\"Back In Time\\". I have it on my PSP and I listen to it all the time. It's offical that Men In Black 3 is another of my all-time favorite movies. I'll be waitin' to get it on both DVD and Blu-Ray.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this story and I can't wait for the third book to come out next year.  I have to say I love to read and I listen to audiobooks on my drive to & from work each day.  This book & the next in the series has captured my attention. I have been so in grossed in the hot and steaming parts of the story & suddenly I look over at the car next to me and I think &#34;can they hear this audio book? I smile really big and keep on driving and listening? These books are worth reading or listening.  I hope Sylivia Day writes many more books like this one.
B002R88G4U|3.0|The book is written exclusively in letter format which makes for an interesting read. What I personally enjoyed most was the writing style and how the author manages to keep your attention through the correspondence between the characters. You always  know who is 'speaking' to who, when and why.<br /><br />Though the book deals with a dark part of history it takes a different perspective on World War II, managing to keep it light and focusing on the human interactions in a society trying to survive a Nazi Occupation.<br /><br />However, since the book is applauded by so many, (my expectations might have been too high) I was disappointed with the plot. Since we are so familiar with World War Two stories and scenarios, It didn't really feel like anything 'really' happened (because there is always a sense of \\"I have heard this before\\" This is a harsh statement I know, because WWII was atrocious, however we have become desensitised by it) So I constantly didn't feel there was anything new. However the way it is told and the rich characters do manage to add various flavours to this part of history.<br /><br />I still think The Book Thief by Mark Zusak is a more entertaining and gripping read within this genre.<br /><br />However The Guernsey Literary and Patato Peel Pie Society still remains a lovely read, especially if you love literature. Loved reading about other books and authors within a book.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|This toy is the best toy for tummy-time.  My daughter had torticollis, a neck condition, and really hated tummy-time.  She loved this toy and it helped her roll over.  It is also encouraging her to crawl now.  She just loves to follow the mirror as it rolls around, and it play tunes like \\"If you're happy and you know it...\\"  and we sing along and clap our hands.  LOVES it.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|This movie was good fun. And it was certainly a new experience of Tom Cruise, so he can sing, and he does a good job doing it. :-) He is certainly a talented guy! I like musicals and there was certainly some good talent! I enjoyed it.

B004SDEP38|5.0|I LOVE Docs and use it primarily to record my purchases at the time of purchase!  A regular register required I have a pen and place to write so I would wait till I was home.  Then I would forget or have lost the receipt.  Life is too busy!  By utilizing Docs in my phone, I always have it with me, usually in my hand, and need no pen or other surface to record.  LOVE LOVE IT!

B009NQKPUW|3.0|I felt like I was watching an updated version of Alien with a splash of background thrown into it. It was ok but not great.
B0068RHSCW|4.0|I had no expectations for this movie, and I did not watch the trailer, which another reviewer suggested.  The beginning was slow, but ok.  How can a movie with Daniel Craig be bad?  Anyway, then it really twists and you become much more invested in watching it.  I wind up fast forwarding through a good chunk of many movies, but this one I didn't.  I don't understand how it only got one star, it was better than that.  Watch it, if you are a Daniel Craig or Naomi Watts fan, Rachel Weisz is just ok.  Definitely a mind bender, you won't see the end coming at all.

1444737112|5.0|I can't praise this book high enough. I am not going to put this book \\"under the microscope\\" like some reviewers have regarding the style of writing, grammar etc. I feel the \\"soul\\" of the book is what counts here and in all honesty, I was so absorbed with the storyline, I was not in the least interested with such matters. Overall a truly inspirational book, easy to read and written in a wonderfully humble and modest fashion. I think this book is a relevant and an enjoyable read for all ages; my 90 year old mother has read it and thoroughly enjoyed it too! Thank you James for sharing your life experiences with us; you have given me a new perspective on drug addiction and the homeless.  I sincerely wish James and the charismatic, intelligent Bob all the best life can give them. Congratulations to both of you for finding each other and sharing your wonderful story with us all.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I have always been a fan of new age / classical and also today's music.  It is also true that I am a major fan of YouTube musicians.  I love to find the gems out there in a world overly glamorized by the \\"industry\\".  I purchased this knowing I would enjoy the music but I had no idea how much.  I drove to work this morning and got through almost the entire album.  It has been years since I have had music move me to the point of joyful tears.  This album is breathtaking, alive and renews the deep spirit behind \\"heart & soul\\".  Within the next few weeks I will become a founding member of The Piano Guys, this music, this taste of exquisite ability must continue!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is one of the best movies of 2012 by far.  The characters are unique and well developed and helps us realize that no matter what our age everyone has \\"real life\\" situations that connect us to one another. Love and hope and adventure and fear are not just for the young but are a part of everyone's life regardless of age or health or finances.  This movie is definitely a \\"thumbs up\\".
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|My daughter's close friend was recently diagnosed with cancer. We heard about this book and gave her a physical copy as a gift. We decided to get our own ebook copy as well. My daughter and I sat down last night and started reading this. It's excellently written and engaging. we immediately connected with the characters and are now completely sucked in. We can't wait for her to get home from school so we can start reading it again. I only gave it four stars because we haven't finished the book yet. I can update this when we do.
B0078XHAB4|4.0|Good easy read, somewhat predictable but most enjoyable. Nice winter tale, feel good book. Would read more books by this author.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|While there were interesting facts about presidents and their relationships, the book becomes almost chatty and more like gossip than real commentary about the interrelationships of each regarding major decisions.  While the Bay of Pigs episode was covered in much detail, the Truman decision to release atomic bombs over Japan was not.  At the end, I failed to understand the authors' contention that there exists or existed a \\"club\\" to which former presidents ascribed their loyalties and trust.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|After seeing the movie in theaters (twice!) I was very excited to see that the soundtrack was all the acapella numbers!  These songs are meant to get your head bobbing and are guaranteed to get stuck in your head long after listening to them.  Some songs seemed more genuine than others, some sounded more computer generated, but over all, I am very pleased with my purchase!
B008PQ8XZK|3.0|I am a fan of kate morton, but this book is not fluent. too artifficial, not realistic on the one hand, but does not support any other genre. I was quite bored but because it is kate morton gave her the benefit of the doubt and read to the end, which was very disappointing to itself.
B006LSZECO|1.0|After a very rousing recommendation from a few co-workers as well as high praise in various other magazines and websites, I decided to purchase this book. Having never read anything by this author, I wasn't familiar with her writing style and to be honest - I wish I had downloaded the sample and saved myself the money.<br /><br />Besides the jumpy and disjointed writing style that flits back and forth, my main issue is the fact that I do not care for Nick NOR Amy. I don't care what happens to either of them. It doesn't matter to me because neither of them are particularly likeable - and that is a major issue for me.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you can read a book and be ambivalent with the protagonist(s), not hold any true emotional attachment nor any care as to their peril (true or perceived), then this book is for you. But if you prefer to have a character that you actually care about and you want to follow their story, find another book to read.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not quite finished with it yet, however it seems to be too long /drawn out , & enough with the comedy !!! Normally a big fan of De Mille , but this one is leaving  me a bit disappointed .
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I was totally blown away by this one. I did not expect to be so caught up in such a simple premise. Beauty, love, and the tragedy of the human condition are exquisitely presented in Joyce's book. I wait eagerly for her next one.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|I was excited for this new book in the series to come out. It was a slow start to begin that is why I only gave it 4 stars  By the end of the book I couldn't put it down and can not wait for the next in the series

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The writers of this series are not resting on their laurels for the third season of The Walking Dead, and neither are the actors. The survivors are continuously in danger of being bitten and none of them are safe from being killed.<br /><br />This is the most intense season of the series so far.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Not nearly as good as the first; glad I only bought this for my kindle. Beach reading at best. Can't get very excited about the 3rd.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Being a John Grisham fan I was not disappointed in his new book \\"The Racketeer.\\"  Since I live in the northeast I was trapped in the house, fortunately with lights and my Kindle, so I read right through his latest book within two days.  Looking forward to his next book.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The movie is great and all that, but I wish the option to get the blu-ray/digital copy was more prevalent. Seems to me that those with access to a blu-ray player are more apt to have digital-only devices vs. wanting to watch the movie in low-def.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The perfect gem matching game with endless replay value.  The more times you go through the map , the more difficult it gets.  Save your powerups, because you'll need them when it gets tough. You can also start all over again if it gets too hard. I got this as the faotd, but it's definitely worth paying for.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Gave hubby several things and was ecstatic to get this too!  We loved this at the theater and hubby had read most of the books already so it is a prized addition to our DVD collection.
B000HF702E|2.0|There were a handful of sexual innuendos that caused me to take this movie off of our approved list. I don't need my boy encouraged to stare at Elle MacPherson's rear end or have busty secretaries with sexual connotations educating him on a \\"family movie\\".
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The instructions are especially good for someone who doesn't normally use, or like, Microsoft Word. Now, with Wordperfect able to save in Word format and the aid of this book, it is easy to create a decent Kindle book. I like it.<br />Dan Weatherington
B008G33OJM|1.0|Yet another that waited for a Blu-Ray version that will not play past the titles. Wait until the issue is addressed and resolved. :(
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It was dark and twisted and full of unexpected plot twists!  Wonderfully written and brilliantly finished.  I love how real the ending was!  Perfect!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A little better than his last three or four.  I read it in two days and it held my interest.  Liked the characters.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child continues to provide readers with a great read.  I always enjoy learning more and more about Jack Reacher and this book doesn't disappoint.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B000002LBH|5.0|If you love the Smiths then you have to have this album in your collection. I had it on vinyl (don't ask me why I said HAD because its a dagger in my heart knowing I do not have it anymore in this capacity, had it on cassette, and now have it on cd and have it on my ipod and ipad too. Its nothing less than magnificent.
B000024JCA|5.0|Had this album in the 70's. Just saw it again on Amazon so ordered it. Still as good as I remembered. Great guitar work. Arrived sooner than expected so was very happy with purchase! Really recommend this CD.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|look to get the CD that contains the 2 remix songs,,like a virgin amd material girl,, this Cd does not show in tracklist but it does show in mp3 download,,, you will want the remix album,,, its the best part of album when mix from modonna album and not anothers remix.,<br />its a great album ,, her young stuff,,shes the greatest<br />thank you
B007TK77QE|4.0|This was an entirely different genre from this author.  It is about a village in England with small town mentality.  The residents know everything there is to know about each other.  When one of the residents dies unexpectedly, it leaves a vacancy on the town council.  This causes competition between the varying factions in the village.  One faction, who are trying to retain the village way of life and the other faction, who recognise things are a-changing and they have to incorporate others into their locality and lives.<br /><br />A good story. If you like Joanna Trollope stories, you will enjoy this.
0425263916|5.0|Okay, so I read Bared in under 5 hours - sat down and sunk into Reflected and 4 hours later was a complete mess.<br /><br />The struggles of two abused main characters is beautifully written, the chemistry, obsession and complete raw emotion of this book rocked me to my core.  By the end of the book I had a lump in my throat and like a wave, the next morning I cried my eyes out.  This series is amazing.  It touches on the troubles and torment of love in the midst of abused pasts - which doesn't seem to be the most romantic thing to write about.  But it is so well written, it comes across that some serious thought and research was put into abusive situations to get the emotions just right. As a survivor of a past abusive relationship it hit on emotions that I thought were long gone, but not in a way that was bad.  It completely shattered me to read the 2nd half of the book.<br /><br />Their story is beautifully done, a roller coaster of ups/downs that makes you dizzy.  As the story progresses you start to put things together in your mind as to what happened in his past and as the pieces fall into place your heart breaks.  If you read Bared to You and weren't sucked in - GIVE THIS BOOK A CHANCE.  It gives you answers and makes you fall in love with both of them.<br /><br />I have cried during books, typically while I read them.  I have never found myself so emotionally stuck hours later.  This book broke down a dam of emotions that had been tucked away quite nicely for years.  It was amazing and freeing.  I can't wait till #3 is out.
030758836X|4.0|I ABOSULUTLY LOVED THIS BOOK,,IT WAS SO INTRIUGING,SO FILLED WITH SO MUCH DETAIL,UNTIL THE END,I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE ENDING AT ALL..IT WAS A LET DOWN.ITS ALMOST LIKE SHE THREW IT TOGETHER AT THE ENDING,LOST HER VISION.
0425263908|5.0|My introduction to romance novels was via Fifty Shades - tempted into reading it from friends who loved it.  After finishing Fifty I needed something to keep me from reading it over and over again.  I was going to wait to get Bared to You until the 3rd book was released, just in case it was that good (I did not want to have to wait).  Well I ended up getting books 1 & 2.<br /><br />I finished this book in under 5 hours, could not put it down.  It was well written, the characters were developed as well.  Being new to romance fiction I am not sure if I have been missing out or if this book was just that good...<br /><br />If you are an avid romance reader, I am sure you will love this.  If you are new to these types of books because of Fifty Shades of Grey then you will LOVE this series.  A lot of people commented on it being similar to Fifty, terms were similar (but that may just be typical romance novel lingo).  I saw some connections but did not think it was anywhere a copy-cat type book.  It gave me my fix I needed after being sucked into the Fifty Craze and will be checking out other books by Day to sink into.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is great so much fun would tell everybody to download asap. hours of great fun that you and the kids will love
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Slick well paced page turner . Perhaps not quite up to his best but a good read.<br />Look forward to his next
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Worth a first viewing. Not worth a purchase for a home library. Left the door open at the end for a sequel so you won't leave completely satisfied.
B003QSMC18|5.0|It is a really cute movie. My four year old loves anything Disney Princess and this movie was no exception.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I installed this on my Kindle Fire and it's perfect. Very bright, can change the Colorado and intensity. Exactly what I was looking for.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|It has been too long since Nelson Demille has written a new book. But the Panther was and is worth the wait. I remember his first book called By The Rivers of Babaylon. After reading this book I was hooked on anything Nelson wrote. and the suspense of this book and the familiar characters such as John Cory and his wife feel like family. the best part about Demilles suspense fnovels is you find yourself laughing at his whit.  If you love suspense don't miss this one.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I will not do justice to their music, but I have to try. So much of the market is devoid of good storytelling and OMAM's My Head is an Animal is filled with rich and vivid stories set to complex melodies. Many of the titles are vignettes where the story is being told to a soundtrack, like listening to a short movie unfolding. You can close your eyes and see a whole little world being built and lived. This is what musical artists are supposed to do, but it's rare and worth remarking upon.
B008476HBM|5.0|Brilliant, as expected, well written , enjoyed very much, as good as expected from the Bbc adaptation.  Will read again
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find this site very addicting. I love looking at the pictures and repinning to my site. The food and drink site has a lot of good recipe ideas
0307592731|5.0|I was captivated from the first page! Since such an undertaking would personally never enter my mind or ever tempt me to try such a feat.....I was ready and willing to go with Cheryl anywhere! Strayed has a clear and straightforward style of writing and is so honest and introspective as she undertakes this trek, hoping it will heal her and help her to find herself. Just knowing she was \\"lost\\" was her first, and most important step. At first I wondered why she thought this most arduous hike would solve any of her problems but I became a believer as I shared her relentless determination. As she hiked the Pacific Creast Trail from Mojave to Portland, which is over 1000 miles of mountains and desert, she bravely faced her own demons, her grief over the loss of her beloved mother, her scattered family, and her failed marriage, all with such a clear eye. Her journey is transformative for her.....and so compelling for the reader. I highly recommend \\"Wild\\"!
0452277752|5.0|As Bachman, King seems to write much about versions of dystopia, whether it be visions of the future or the lead character's own personal world gone wrong and how they deal with it. The Bachman books, much the same as many of King's books, have as their protagonist; outsiders, loners and underdogs, which I inadvertently find myself rooting for, no matter what character flaws they may have.<br /><br />I picked up a compendium of four of the Bachman stories for £1 at a charity book sale. The four stories being: `Rage', `The Long Walk', `Roadwork' and the reason I picked the book up in the first place... `The Running Man'.<br /><br />'Rage'<br /><br />The first of the Bachman books sees the main character, Charlie Decker, a senior at high school, called from his class by the headteacher to discuss an incident where he had assaulted and seriously injured one of his teachers. During this meeting, Charlie snaps, is expelled from school and he then leaves the headmaster's office and retrieves a pistol from his locker. Things go from bad to worse for all involved...<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest point of note about this particular tale is that King is no longer comfortable with it being in print after its association with incidents supposedly inspired by the contents of the story... King himself has publically spoken about the novel and its influence: \\"The Carneal incident [another US school shooting where `Rage' was allegedly an influence] was enough for me. I asked my publisher to take the damned thing out of print. They concurred.\\"<br /><br />For me, Rage is not the best of the Bachman books but is an interesting little story that could have easily been written by another author. Despite its apparent influences on maladjusted individuals, it is my opinion that it is still quite a powerful short story and comments succinctly on adolescent frustration, social class division and bullying among other issues.<br /><br />'The Long Walk'<br /><br />Set in a dystopian, militaristic and totalitarian America of the not too distant future, The Long Walk refers to a wildly popular \\"sport\\" which sees 100 teenage boys enter and participate in the titular annual contest. Sounds very much like The Hunger Games, right?! The rules are fairly simple: walkers must maintain an average walking speed of 4mph, not stop, not sleep, do anything to deviate from the route set or they will receive a warning. Receiving three warnings will result in being \\"ticketed\\". Given that there are soldiers in vehicles riding alongside the walkers, it soon becomes abundantly clear to the reader what the meaning of that third warning is. The winner of the contest and recipient of \\"the prize\\" is the last boy left alive.<br /><br />The popularity of this contest is akin to the gameshows seen in `The Running Man' (see review in Part II or refer to the Arnie movie!). Such shows seem to be an effort to stupify the masses, give them hope and take their minds off the misery of their own lives, much the same way Roman emperors used the Colosseum or ITV uses the X-Factor. Perhaps it's just the cynic in me but this particular story seems to be particularly apt when in this time of austerity and cutbacks, the Government is spending millions gearing up for the Olympic and Commonwealth Games by building new facilities and stadia across the country and urging the nation to get behind this initiative.<br /><br />Again, I don't want to give too much of the story away but this is a close second to my favourite out of these books and it would appear that Frank Darabont (long time King fan and Director of the screen adaptations of The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile and The Mist) is a fan also. Darabont has secured the screen rights to The Long Walk.<br /><br />This short story held my attention considerably and images conjured up in my head from the reading of it and the powerful ending remain in my mind long after the last sentence was read.<br /><br />`Roadwork'<br /><br />I feel Ihave to apologise in advance since my opinion on `Roadwork' is not a favourable one. I found this particular tale to be distinctly average and, like `Rage', King admits it was written at a time of high emotion in his own life and to my mind, is not his finest work or even indeed of the Bachman books.<br /><br />`Roadwork' sees a Mr Average American (Barton Dawes) in the suburban midwest, subjected to some of the more harrowing, yet still very real, experiences that ordinary people have to deal with in the course of their lives. Dawes loses everything and the focus of his anger at this loss becomes the new motorway being constructed and alluded to in the title, culminating in a destructive finale.<br /><br />Taken directly from the introduction to the Bachman Books, King said:<br />\\"I think it was an effort to make some sense of my mother's painful death the year before - a lingering cancer had taken her off inch by painful inch. Following this death I was left both grieving and shaken by the apparent senselessness of it all... Roadwork tries so hard to be good and find some answers to the conundrum of human pain.\\"<br /><br />`Roadwork' is like the diet version of the Michael Douglas movie `Falling Down'. It had so much potential but I feel that King's own frame of mind at the time may have had a major part to play in the feel of the story. Readers may find some sort of allegorical interpretation in what King has set out here but for me, it simply didn't hit the mark.<br /><br />'The Running Man'<br /><br />As stated earlier, this is the reason I shelled out one whole Queen's Head for this book. Raised on a diet of Arnie, Van Damme and Seagal movies, I had to read this book!<br /><br />The book however, is distinctly different, darker and far superior to the movie loosely based on it...<br /><br />Set in America in the year 2025, `The Running Man' sees the US economy in ruins, its citizens living in abject poverty and entertained by the violent and often lethal gameshows provided by The Games Network; `The Running Man' is the most popular of these said shows. The format of the game is distinctly different than that shown in the Arnie flick; contestants choose to enter the game, usually through desperation for cash; Contestants can travel anywhere they choose (globally) but there are \\"Hunters\\" tracking them down and will kill the contestants once caught. Contestants earn $100 for every hour they evade capture but must also submit videos on a regular basis to prove they are alive and remain in the game. Additionally, contestants will receive $100 for every law enforcement officer or Hunter that they kill. Manage to survive 30 days, the contestant receives $1billion.<br /><br />So, already some differences from the movie, notably no \\"game areas\\". Also, the Hunters aren't brightly costumed freakshows with unique weaponry and gadgets; to my mind, it is more terrifying that the Hunters wear no mark or clue as to reveal their identity and carry concealed weapons, allowing them to travel anonymously while they hunt for contestants.<br /><br />Ben Richards, the focus of the novel, is one such contestant. A man driven to enter in order to pay for medicine for his dying daughter and in an effort to stop his wife \\"turning tricks\\" to get what medicine she could. King has stated that the Richards of the book is \\"...as far away from the Arnold Schwarzenegger character in the movie as you can get.\\" and described him as \\"scrawny\\" and \\"pre-tubercular\\"!<br /><br />There is no question that `The Running Man' is an action driven story. However, it is much grittier than the movie of the same name and far more cerebral. The reader can't help but empathise with Richards' predicament; his desperation is palpable; his paranoia and suspicion while \\"playing the game\\" is very real and his determination to finish what he started has you rooting for him all the way to the book's end which could not be more different from the movie; and makes for a chillingread given that it mirrors events that take place in reality approximately twenty years later...<br /><br />King allegedly wrote this story in only 3 days. `The Running Man' reads as a fast-paced, action story set in a future gone wrong but I would never have guessed that King brought this all together in such a short space of time. As previously stated, this story is the reason I bought the book and is the tale that I chose to read first and of the four, it is my firm favourite.<br /><br />The Bachman Books, in my opinion, are rightly categorised as horror. All four stories have at their core, bleak views of life, whether it be the dystopian futures of `The Long Walk' and `The Running Man'; the all too real nightmare of `Rage'; or the steady slip into oblivion of `Roadwork'.shows provided by The Games Network; `The Running Man' is the most popular of these said shows.

B0086449YA|5.0|I received \\"Privateering\\" in time to give a couple of good listens to both discs prior to seeing Mark open up for Bob Dylan at Broomfield, CO.  This album is replete with fine examples of Knopfler's tasty guitar virtuosity, first class baladeering and some decent rockers.  The band is, as usual, well in step and equal to the task of backing Mark.  They also performed excellently in the concert.  The last time I saw Mark (Red Rocks), he didn't do any songs from his latest CD and relied quite heavily on Dire Straits favorites.  This time I think he had more confidence in the new material and played quite a lot of it while doing just two or three of the old group's songs.  Gritty, gravely travelin' Bob was rather of a letdown after Knopfler's show.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|F.R.I.E.N.D.S is one of the best shows to have ever hit the Television world! I am very happy with this product as it is packaged well and is filled with trivia and commentary which makes it more exciting for die-hard fans of the show like me!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham's books anyway, but this one was even better than expected. Grabs you on the first page and you won't want  to put it down!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not what I expected at all.  It was much better.  I couldn't put it down, I actually read it twice.  yes there is a lot of sex, but it goes with the story.  That is how Christian coped with everything, to make sure all was well, to distract, to please, the list goes on.<br />I highly recommend these books, they will totally entertain.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so entertaining and lovable!! Its also a great way to pass time!!:) I really do love it a lot!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is amazing, anyone that really likes military books, will love this book, the author captured as much as he could without giving up to much info, and still doesn't lose anything in the writing
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved it!!! There were a lot of little intrigues to keep it interesting! The book reminded me of The Historian. I'm anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read the second & third novels in the trilogy.
0375507256|5.0|This is my first reading of a novel by David Mitchell.  I love the way he writes! I haven't finished reading it yet but, I am so intrigued so far...I'm not going to watch the movie until I'm finished so, don't give it away!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Much better than last book.  More like her earlier ones.  However, she does get a bit bogged down in needless detail.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|While I definitely enjoyed reading The Panther, I feel it was a disappointment relative to DeMille's other books. John Corey's endless quips got tiresome and repetitive, and the motivation of both the Panther and the CIA people seemed unclear and poorly developed. If you enjoyed the previous books in this series, you will probably like this one too, but it is not as gripping. If DeMille plans to continue this series, he needs to find some new twists to revitalize it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader is the quintessential product for any computer user.  Portable Document Format (pdf) is the glue that binds various computer types, operating systems and computer users.  The internet would be a barren place without Adobe.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great entertainment, the most gory, graphic, series to ever hit the idiot box \\"that's what my father call it\\". Now if they could figure out how to make it a first person shooter series it would be perfect. But if they don't, it's perfect anyway.
1603420398|5.0|Just received this book and liked it right away. I was surprised by a coil bind, which I think is really nice if you intend to use this book a lot and have pages open for a long time white trying out all those patterns.  The book is very well organized and the patterns are very interesting.  I also like the photos of the samples.  Very clear and done in beautiful combination of colors, with quality yarns, they are like little works of art in themselves. Beginners will not be intimidated by this book as the instructions are clear and diagrams are easy to understand.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Was very disappointed in this  book.  John Grisham hasn`t had a good book in a long time;<br />His first five were great.  I couldn`t put them down.  Couldn`t wait to finish this one because it<br />is so boring.  The last several books I`ve read of his just don`t have it anymore for me.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This app is free for my android phone so why should I have to pay to put it on my Kindle Fire? The same goes for Angry Birds Space. I would give these zero stars if I could. Greedy little piggies!
159420411X|5.0|I had been following Nate Silver on Twitter and at fivethirtyeight.com and knew he used to be in Sports.  I found his foxes versus hedgehogs analogy to be very apt.  Being a computer engineer, I already know the Big Data aspects are very useful.  And I'm very sympathetic to the idea of noodling out all the different issues that might affect the probability of events.  I, too, hate to admit I am wrong.  But that's life.  It's a good explanation of how to think clearly. It reminds me of the Sherlock Holmes stories.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|Owners of Macs with investments in multiple MagSafe AC converters have been forced by Apple to buy these converters to use them with newer MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs (now require MagSafe adaptors).  It's a shameful grab for money by Apple, because the new MagSafe 2 adaptors offer zero functional enhancements.  Apple knows that users of MagSafe AC chargers will choose to  part with $29 for the adapter, rather than $69 for a new AC converter.  As always, Apple will arrogantly laugh its way to the bank with your money.  Having this said, the MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converter is high quality and works exactly as intended.
0307592731|4.0|I doubt I could ever do what this woman did, but found her story fascinating. Unable to resolve grief issues surrounding the death of her mother, Strayed proceeds to self-destruct over a four-year period. After messing up her marriage and getting involved with drugs, she comes to recognize a desperate need for grounding and centering in her life. As a result of reading a guidebook on the subject of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, Strayed decides to try it for herself. She hopes the challenge and isolation of the hike will grant her greater clarity in her struggles and a vision for her life and future. Interestingly, Strayed had no hiking experience prior to attempting this Herculean feat. As you can imagine, the journey is action-packed, at times frightening, and often painful. She begins the journey lost and self-absorbed, but learns much about herself while struggling with the elements, her limitations, and occasional foolish choices. I found Strayed's humor and honesty endearing and refreshing. I know others have been put off by the fact this memoir reads somewhat like entries in a journal.  I love journal writing, though, so the way this memoir is written appeals to me. Admittedly, there is some blistering language and an account of at least one gratuitous sexual encounter, but if you can look past those things, Strayed finds some truth during her time on Pacific Crest Trail which will resonate with many.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I expected more details of his experience to the afterlife.  There were to many medical terms and details.  There were many pages that I just skipped over.
0525952926|5.0|This is the second book of Follett's planned trilogy (\\"Fall of the Giants\\" is the first) which tells the history of the 20th century by examination of the major events related to the world wars.  The book ranks near the top in my favorite Follett's list.  It is truly riveting as it weaves complex tales around the lives of families in America, Germany, Russia, and Great Britain.  These families are first introduced in \\"Fall of the Giants\\"  and this novel continues the tale of their evolutions.  The novel, if it was a film, would probably be described as a docudrama, i.e., it uses literary and narrative techniques to flesh out the bare facts of events in history to tell the story.  Indeed the novel covers a period from 1933 starting with the ascendency of Adolf Hitler to chancellor of Germany and the rise of Nazism to 1949 when the Russians demonstrate (explode) their first atomic bomb.  Many of the major twentieth century figures and events are chronicled in this book.  Political actors include: Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, Hitler. Scientific actors include : Leslie Groves, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi; Some of the events woven into the plot are: Pearl Harbor, Normandy, Manhattan Project. However, the fundamental essence of the book revolves around love, both fulfilled and unfulfilled;  disappointment and triumph; compassion and cruelty; loyalty and treason; and hate and humanity.  All the values which identify us as human beings.

B003U0I9U0|5.0|\\"We're Looking For The Whales\\" is just about the only track I'm missing on this excellent A-Ha remaster compilation.<br /><br />Fans of this group may think of a few other tracks they'd want on this album, but overall it delivers the complete \\"A-Ha\\" experience on two discs. Children of the 80s will mostly likely favor the first disc since it hits most of their highlights in that decade. But A-Ha went on to produce more excellent music in the 90s and beyond, and this collection covers most of it. The remastering is excellent, and both vocals and instruments shine in this recording. People buying this probably already know most of the songs, so there's no need review them. As a best-of, it captures most of what made A-Ha such a New Wave band hit. The quality of the recording is excellent.<br /><br />For newcomers to A-Ha, this is a great introduction to many of their popular tracks and a few that are not so well known. For long-time fans, it is a concise collection of what made them so good. To hardcore fans I would recommend getting each album - especially the remastered versions with extended content. But in a pinch, this really is just about all of the A-Ha you'll ever need.<br /><br />~ Kort

1451688091|5.0|Goodwins' book a Team of Rivals is amazing!  It is almost 800 pages and is a major work that is stunning in its ability to engage the reader.  It is a concurrent history of several men who were contemporaries of Lincoln.  The contrast is astounding, as well as the personal and well documented, researched perspectives.<br /><br />One of the major items  which was a surprise to this reader, was the ability of these historical figures, many of whom are well known, was their ability in their personal writings, to speak of their emotional lives.  The level at which they share their heart's  yearnings and longings is beyond what most men today might be comfortable to share with wives and loved ones.<br /><br />This is a historical view of the life and times of Lincoln and his political rivals.  A book that is certainly well worth the time it takes to read!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I wanted this book to have more detail about what he saw in heaven and all the people he met and how he felt when he saw Jesus but none of that was there.  There was a lot of medical detail that I'm sure the scientific world can understand.  I am thankful for the fact that he is not ashamed to tell the world about his experience, even at the risk of being shunned by the medical community.  If anyone knows how our brains work, a neurosurgeon surely does, and he is 100% sure he went to heaven.  He never said that he had trusted Christ as Savior and maybe that is the reason he never was in a definite position in heaven.  Maybe that was God's way of warning him because there were times he was in a dark, murky place.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was an easy and quick read with a simple plot and good character development.  I would have enjoyed a lot more attention to describing different areas.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like this battery app because it has great graphing abilities. Also it will show the amount of time you have left to use your tablet based on the amount of battery charge.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It is cool,but compared to real minecraft,it is BAD.Just get minecraft on the computer,and this,it totally SUCKS.Really.It is a HUGE difference.Hey,block story is bad,too,so they are the same.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|It was  a great movie, close to the book, which I read, and what makes it even better is, that it arrived fast! The movie is action packed, good acting, and some awesome special effects that actually makes one think, what if I lived in that world? I already referred this movie to friends and family because it is that good! [[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
0345803507|5.0|The book arrived sooner than I expected, which was wonderful. The book was a great read overall!!! So happy and pleased!!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|If you only watch one episode of Once Upon a Time, watch Skin Deep. But, why skimp on one of the best shows out there? Watch them all.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the best book that I have ever read!  I loved every minute of this book.  Kate Morton has woven together amazingly complex and highly fragile characters who prove to be multi-dimensional in many ways.  The pacing is excellent, as is the story line.  I laughed, I cried, and I was very sad that the read was over.  There are times as a reader when you can actually get so lost in a story that you wonder if your life is reality or if your life is the one in the book.  This is one of those reads.  In 57 years, this is it for me!  I am a new fan of Kate Morton, although I do not see how anyone could top this story.  Such a message relevant to us all, expecially those of us who are older and have grown children.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|I trialed the &quot;free&quot; version &amp; it freed up a lot of memory on my Kindle Fire. Now, I have the &quot;PRO&quot; version &amp; use it everyday to keep my memory clean &amp; Kindle Fire running fast. Easy to use...5 STARS

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Having been born in 1972 the subject of JFK‘s assassination is something I vaguely remember from high school history. I have never felt like I was actually living in this period of time more than I did in this book. And who knew Stephen King could write a love story?
0143119680|5.0|I am 40 pages shy of finishing this book and I already purchased the second.  The book is well researched (clearly a scholar) and the attention to detail created a very vivid picture in my mind as I read it. I can understand why some may think there are too many details, etc. However, this is part of its richness for me. The reader can visualize the character's appearances, understand their motivations and differences as creatures, learn about historical details that can only be revealed in a work such as this or in an academic monograph. I think the fiction is much more enthralling (though I am now intrigued by her book, \\"The Jewel House\\"). It has been hard to put down and I am anxious to get home tonight to finish. As I have my own research to conduct, it will be painful not to \\"tear into\\" book 2 (Shadow of Night)immediately. Anxious for book 3!!

B005OZE9SA|2.0|I bought this interface after reading positive reviews. My primary use if for recording electric guitars and some vocals. For vocals it works fine and get a nice sound from my cheapo Samson mike (hence the 2 stars). However the problem I have is with recording guitar. Plugging in my guitars (Gibson SG and Les Paul) into the instrument input results in constant signal clipping even with the gain turned all the way down. The only way I can avoid the clipping is by selecting line input and setting the gain control appropriately. Unfortunately the sound produced using the line in is very muddy. I am hugely disappointed in this product and after searching on-line it seems the only solution to this overly common problem is to either buy a different interface or  run a DI box between my guitar and the 2i2. Either of those options is going to cost me money.
B00884GR0W|5.0|its a great app for the Fire, with great graphics! but it needs a bit more stuff like: flowing water, working Tnt, and a &quot;creative&quot; mode with all the blocks. I love Minecraft but this is my best 5$ app I have bought!
B00873GRU4|3.0|I enjoyed this short dystopian story about a society that exists inside a silo, supposedly to protect the populuation from the contaminated world outside the silo. To venture outside means certain death, and only those who are crazy or crimimal are sent out to clean the camera lenses so people on the inside can at least see what the world looks like beyond their enclosed environment.<br /><br />The protagonists wife is a researcher of some sort who uncovers some interesting things about past \\"uprisings\\", and she begins to question everthing they've been told about the outside. She becomes certain that the images they see aren not real and they are being duped into staying inside for reasons they don't yet understand. One day she finds out something that causes her to have some sort of meltdown and she volunteers to go outside. When she is alone in a cell with her husband, who is the sheriff, she tells him that she has to find out what is out there, and that she'll be back for him. I found her sudden decision the weakest part of the story but I guess it's meant to demonstrate how strongly she believed in her theory, and how claustrophobic their enclosed world had become to her.<br /><br />The main character believes his wife has died because he saw her collapse on a hill just beyond the silo after she'd finished cleaning. The question everyone on the inside asks is why do people still clean even when they are facing death? Why don't the just make a run for it and at least attempt to survive? The author does answer this question, but not quite satisfactorily in my opinion. The story could have been fleshed out a bit more in places. I don't want to give the ending away but there are a couple of surprising twists which keep it interesting and made me want to continue reading the rest of the books in the series.<br /><br />Wool is a well-written, fast read. I loved the philosophical questions it raises about what is real, and how do we know the differece between truth and illusion in a mediated world? These questions are more relevant than ever when so much of life in the modern world is conducted through a screen and I think Hugh Howey has tapped into something powerful here.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Excellent plotting with extreme detail you never would figure out, but unsatisfactory ending because evil-doers did not loose out totally  Good characterization but just a little bit too slick
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. So glad it got here quick. Thank you! It has great quality and has not freezed on me yet, which is a great sign.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Loving season 2! The first few episodes of season 1 had me watching with lights on. Season 2 hasn't been as frightening in the \\"ghost story\\" sense, but it has been terrifying on many other levels. The asylum setting (and the people who may or may NOT belong there) gives me alot of anxiety. The storylines are interesting. The writing is sick, twisted, and brilliant. And the acting is superb--Jessica Lange rocks it once again as a deranged and vindictive nun and Sarah Paulson is a sight to behold. This is not a continuation of the first season (come on people, do you NOT have internet access?!). Some of the actors are the same, but their characters--and the storyline--are completely different. If you are not enjoying season 2--you're doing it WRONG!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was hard to put down, I recommend this book to everyone! (over the age of 18)  ;-) Very well written, I had trouble putting it down!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie represents the ultimate Achievement in comic book movies. Not just for the quality of the movie itself but for the massive storyarch Built by the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. All the movies that make up Marvel's \\"Phase One\\" Average out to be Awsome. Yes the Hulk movies were weak and I rightfully expected more that the so-so product got out of the God of Thunder's first Movie, but when the Marvel Cinematic Univerese hits it mark it REALLY HITS its mark. The First Iron Man Movie was great and  I was pleasently  suprised to see that Captian America: The First Avenger not only the best pre Avengers movie of Phase one but the best Super Hero movie of that Summer (and there was a lot of them that summer).<br /><br />Though the M.C.U. story arch was and is not perfect but it kept all us nerds begging for more building up the excitement for the big payoff. The Avengers, which to my great suprise only continued to build up to the real payoff. After all the laughs, action, great proformaces, (and in my opion much better writting than this series gets credit for) The biggest payoffs are yet to come.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert-----------------------<br /><br />At the end of the movie the signature line up of heroes is still not realized. Avengers tower is not finished and a New great Villian rears his ugly head in the middle of the Credits. The Avengers will not be fully assembled and realized until at least the end of Marels Phase Two.
B00992CF6W|5.0|they need to add buckets its really hard to make tree farms and water sources in the places where you really need to make them they should also add pistons and armor.

B003QS9TKU|1.0|This Film has little in the way of a plot the acting is bad, the animation is bad, this film is TERRIBLE! I sat through this peice of s*** simply because I'm a Disney fan and thought I should see all of there no sequel movies. It wasn't worth it. Don't waste your money!

B003UYUP58|5.0|I read this book as research for my upcoming novel, The Uneasy Sleep of Giants. One might think that a book described as the autobiography of cancer would be dry read, but far from it. Author Siddhartha Mukherjee infuses his fantastic book with loads of heart and tons of inside information on the thousand year's war against cancer. If you have cancer or have a relative who has or is battling this insidious disease, this book will provide great perspective on science's quest for a cure.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love these books! The raw emotion I feel while reading these works are unexpected for the price, but I would pay any amount to read more works like these. I would like to thank the author for such amazing stories.

B005LAII3U|3.0|Yeah this is what I thought of the remake.  There were in fact some clever ideas done in this movie like traveling from one side of the planet to another.  I am so sick of seing Kate Beckinsale gale or whatever in these stupid rolls where she always wears a trenchcoat and basically plays the boring part of the half human half vampire in every action movie she has ever been in.  Boo for this movie.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's experience confirmed what I long suspected about our consciousness and what is beyond this world and out there in the Universe.  I love that this happened to a man of science who wasn't afraid to tell the world about what happened to him.  The medical community can't brush it aside as easily as they do when your average person has a NDE.<br /><br />I also love that he doesn't have a religious agenda (he isn't trying to convert anyone).  A lot of other NDE accounts seem aimed at making you find religion OR ELSE.  I was only 1/3 of the book and was in tears.  What he experienced feels very right and very real and I am grateful he had the courage to write this book.  It is a MUST read!

B000002VCQ|5.0|Nothing or no one will ever replace mrs. Houston, and artist of her caliber only comes by every so often and we should be thankful for blessing us with her angelic voice, she could carry a whole nation with that voice and that's what i and many others will miss about her, she sang like she meant it, as if her life depended on it.Although this is probably her greatest album as a whole overall her hits from the others are not to be missed either. My favorite cuts from the album is all of them because there's nothing to skip and i mean nothing, one of the best R&B albums of all time is right before your eyes so my advice to you is to cherish it forever because it's irreplacable timeless music. R.I.P Whitney
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Watching his eccentric vocal and dance expression on the one but an empathetic interpretation on the other hand, made me forget time and space. Though picture's quality is changing, the tone appropriately has been revised and by all recordings are concentrated on the artist at stage, they intentionally cut out the audience fainting one after another. We are shown an extraordinary man, we are given the chance of watching Michael Jackson's variety on probably his best concert tour ever. This DVD is a must not only for the hardcore fans but even for those who believed MJ's music would be forgotten soon, it wouldn't be worth mentioning any more.
B000002LE6|5.0|Prince was dropping dynamite albums in the 80's except around the world in a day,controversy, and the terrible batman soundtrack everything else was on point and is well recieved amongst fans and critics alike.This is one those prince albums that goes under the radar probably because his certified classics 1999,sign o the times, & of course purple rain overshadow the rest of his discography although keep in mind the quality of prince's albums would go down sometimes rock bottom, the ones i recommemd are the gold experience & love symbol from the 90's era. On with the review lovesexy doesn't get it's due as it should because other then alphabet st, this album is flawless in my opinion despite the homo cover as well, prince does no wrong here besides those two missteps i mentioned. The music ranges from funk,pop,rock,soul hell prince does it all there isn't anything he can't make sound good, i love the spiritual tone he takes with this album, makes me feel relaxed and laid back. Overall 10/10 slept on classic, one of his best. My favorite songs include 1.Eye know 2. Glam slam 3.lovesexy 4.When 2 are in love 5.Positivity
B002L4QP0M|4.0|I am a big  fan of Jeffery Archer.  Enjoyed this book as I did so many of his other books.  His stories keep you wanting to read on, hard to put the book down.
B004JMY312|5.0|This review is slightly biast, mainly because this movie will go down as a classic. Created in 1993 and came out the same year. Featuring a nobody actor at the time, today is better known as McGee in NCIS (Binx!)<br /><br />I lover this movie, rented it for Halloween, and it was a great pick. It's scarey, and funny at the sametime. It's not scarey anymore, but when I watched this when I was 5-8 it was scarey. That's for the review part. Below will be a little critique, brief.<br /><br />I would've made Sarah J Parker witch Gwen Stefani, she had blonde feathered hair, and unlike SJP (as far as I know at least) can sing.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read this series while working out on the Elliptical machine.  The books were intriguing and kept my attention thoroughly - sometimes well past the time I planned to spend working out.
B009HSVHV2|4.0|The latest offering from Kiss is a pretty good album. I thought it would be a little more rockin from what I heard before it came out but overall I like it. My favorite song is Freak, and Hell or Hallelujah & Shout Mercy are definitely keepers in my opinion. Being a long time Kiss fan I thought it may be more like the early albums. This album is overall a good addition to any Kiss collection.
1568987846|5.0|I think the book is very inspirational and wonderful.<br /> I love how these 2 artist came together with technology and came together to make this art book.<br />Any artist, photographer or even the art enthusiast should have this book on their shelf.
B009A9EQL6|3.0|I have been looking forward to this album for a long time.  I have been a fan of Aerosmith since 1984.  I like the \\"old school, and new school\\" Aerosmith.  I was looking forward to a harder rocking disc, and there are some cool jams on here like:<br /><br />Oh Yeah<br />Out Go The Lights<br />Street Jesus<br /><br />I even like the ballads as well:<br /><br />What Could Have Been Love<br />Another Last Goodbye<br /><br />But there are two many ballads on here, and I really understand what Aerosmith is trying to do.  They have to appeal to the hard-core fans, and the new ones as well.  (Unfortunately in Chicago no one radio has the guts to play anything new by classic bands, like Aerosmith, ZZ Top, or Lynyrd Skynyrd, so who is going to hear the new stuff?)<br /><br />I do like this album a lot.  It is a good one, but not a great one.  I pretty much like 9 out of the 15 songs on this disc.  I'm sure once I give the others a spin more times, I will like them as well.  This disc is much better than their last one, \\"Just Push Play\\".  Music from this disc sounds a hell of a lot better than the YouTube versions that have been leaked all summer.  One thing I can tell you for sure, is that the band still rocks live.  I saw them in June of 2012.  They just performed on Letterman, and the Today Show, and even did a free outdoor concert in front of their old apartment in Boston.  The boys sound better than ever, and I'm just glad to have new stuff from them.<br /><br />Note:  Buy the deluxe version of this disc.  It has extra tracks which are okay, but also a live DVD of them playing four songs.  Buy the deluxe version from Wal-Mart (sorry Amazon). On the Wal-Mart version, as opposed to the Best Buy version, Aerosmith covers a Temptions song called \\" Shakey Ground\\", a definite must have!
B0081BU42O|4.0|It's been too long since I read a new Iain M. Banks Culture story.  This one has many of the elements that make the Culture interesting.  There are deep-thinking and meddlesome Ship Minds with deliciously-improbable names (e.g., Mistake Not...*) who charge about the universe and dispatch their avatars to interact with mere humans.  There are characters with odd body modifications, including a musician with an extra pair of arms and one male character with 52 extra... appendages.  And there is the expected Culture tech such as knife missiles, full mind state backup, \\"displacement,\\" and a variety of Very Large artificial habitats.<br /><br />This story showcases the \\"Subliming\\" that happens when an entire civilization decides to move on to a higher plane of existence.  A Sublimed civilization disappears from the physical universe, with individuals likely merging to form a single, powerful entity.  Nobody is quite sure how this happens.  It is similar to the process of a civilization moving into the \\"Transcend\\" in Vernor Vinge's [[ASIN:B0047CPB2Y Zones of Thought]] series.  Banks has referred to Sublimation in other Culture books, but much has been left unsaid.  This book scratches our itch for a closer look.<br /><br />The Gzilt civilization is preparing to Sublime.  Individual Gzilt are getting their affairs in order and saying their good-byes to some who will stay behind as the waning \\"Gzilt Remnant.\\"  Various scavenger civilizations probe the edges of Gzilt space, hoping to make a fast grab for abandoned technology and territory.  Amid these preparations, a long-kept secret may be revealed.  It seems that the Gzilt Book of Truth was a hoax perpetrated by the Zidhren civilization.  Revelation of this secret may threaten the unity needed by the Gzilt to Sublime.<br /><br />Drawn into the ensuing conflict, musician and reserve Lieutenant Commander Vyr Cossont finds allies among both the Culture and the Gzilt.  She searches for 9,000-year-old Ngaroe QiRia, who was present at the founding of the Culture and may know why the Gzilt decided not to join it.  As Cossont searches with increasing desperation, the book's chapters count down to the time chosen for Subliming.<br /><br />This is a gotta-read for those who follow the Culture.  And it's a good, accessible story for any science fiction fan reading Banks for the first time.  It's action-driven, but has some new and engaging ideas.<br /><br />--<br /><br />*Short for \\"Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath.\\"ent at the founding of the Culture and may know why the Gzilt decided not to join it.

B0096PAA6E|2.0|I must agree with the other 2 and 3 star reviews. Flipped out over his playing on the Clapton Crossroads DVD. Bought the EP as soon as it came out, Bright Lights and I Don't Owe You a Thing blew me away. Anxiously waited for the first full length CD. As some others have said there are some excellent songs on this CD, however too many dogs in the Pop genre.<br />My advice, don't buy the CD, listen to the samples and download the MP3s that appeal to you. That's the best use of your hard earned dollars
B0085RQLXK|4.0|The problem with long periods between releases is the expectations go up (and rightfully so).  If the album is a letdown, then people are going to wonder what the group has been doing all this time. Certainly not writing lots of songs and filtering out the weak ones.<br /><br />Personally, I'm enjoying the album, but it definitely has flaws.  It has many good songs, but no great songs. By that I mean, if at their concerts they never played any songs from this album, I don't think anyone will be upset.<br /><br />Then aside from missing a standout song or two, this album suffers from being too long.  15 songs or 18 for the deluxe (which is what I bought).  Tracks 1-10 and 15 I enjoy.  The other 4 should have been dropped.<br /><br />And of the 3 deluxe edition bonus tracks, Sunny Side of Love is good, but the other two I feel are droppable.  This would have been a much leaner album with those 12 songs only.  Take those other 6, see what bits you can salvage for future songs and throw the rest away.<br /><br />**Soapbox alert**  As a final note, will groups PLEASE stop recording Diane Warren songs? She's been rewriting the same mundane, generic, faceless ballads for the past 20+ years. She has nothing new! Enough!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Book 4 had a lot of background stories.  Book 5 occurs in parallel with Book 4.  The author basically split 1 time period into 2 books.  It is not as clear, until you are a few chapters into Book 5.  Book 5 also is more exciting, as Book 1-3 were.
B000086EOE|3.0|Steve Hackett was a brilliant member of Genesis in the 70's, and his chops were second to none. However on this album he's made a fatal mistake: vocals. Rather than embrace and improve upon vocals, he has apparently considered them unimportant. John Wetton has a tragic disinterest in the world as he drones the words without passion. Wetton seems to wake up on the occasional Asia tune, otherwise he appears bored beyond words to describe. Special effects for the vocals that Peter Gabriel would embrace are also uninspired. Brilliant 5 star music, brilliantly executed, except that the Wetton 2 star vocals crash the entire project. Worth having? Yes! Just adjust your expectations for the bored vocalist.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved it!!!!! I laughed out loud a lot and cried as well.  Its just a touching story.  I can't wait to read the next book
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like the addition of the story mode and the need to collect items. It keeps the game feeling fresh with the new levels.
B001AW156U|2.0|These triggers keep falling off of the controller.  They finally broke after I used them for about 2 months.  Not worth the money.  They are made of cheap plastic.
B009PEPML4|4.0|Like most, I was shocked when GY!BE announced their return. It's stunning how a band without lyrics or a singer can say so much more through their music about the despair, anger, and persistence of people than most bands who do. Their work is more vital and welcome than ever.  This album explores that anger, but also seeks to uplift. It does so magnificently.
1451683405|1.0|The author cannot put together logical arguments where conclusions flow from premises and analysis. He just offers his illogical trains of thought and asserts his own ill-formed conclusions.<br /><br />The last paragraph of the book reads, and I quote Sam Harris, the author, \\"What brings my deliberations on these matters to a close? This book must end sometime - and now I want to get something to eat.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately, he was hungry and didn't ramble further.
0525952926|5.0|I am a big fan of Ken Folletts novels. I enjoyed The Pillars of the Earth/World Without End and the first book in this trilogy. His detail to history is always spot on with interesting facts which may have faded into history but he brings to live. An example is on page 313 with his mention of Arthur Greenwood (who at that time was Deputy leader of the Labor party)  and his \\"Speak for England Arthur\\" speech. At that time it was a catch phrase but has melted into the abyss of history. Follet is somehow able to find this nugget and use it as a part of the book.<br />My only problem with the book is it is sometimes hard to rememeber who's who (although there is a glossary at the beginning to refer to), the connection between them and believe that they would somehow keep bumping into each other over two continents and several countries.<br />His colorful characters often remind me of Edward Rutherfurds novels and I look forward to the third in this series.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved the video.  Entertaining and interesting and a video I will watch again. I also plan to entertain family and friends with a casual evening in the near future.  I also plan to add a collection of similar videos to mmy video library.  Ladtly a great value.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to Pinterest. I find this to be the best site for ideas, inspiration and motivation. It is just plain fun! 2 thumbs up, 5 stars :)
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I don't think there's any such thing as a mediocre Michael Connelly novel and this one doesn't disappoint on any level. It may actually be one of my favorites. Protagonist Harry Bosch, recently suspended from the LAPD and awaiting re-instatement, has the time so he decides to investigate the death of his mother, murdered many years before in a case never solved.  That makes this more personal than any of the others, and Harry acquits himself admirably. The reader gets to know more about Harry's early life, which humanizes him on a level not possible in his other ventures. The result is gratifying. Enough said; just buy the book, as well as all of the others in the series. Life is too short to miss out on a good thing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this game is very fun. it combines both angry birds space and also the classic angry birds. I love this game its highly addicting and u should get it. I would highly recommend this app!
1842437240|2.0|This was first exposure to this author. The writing was competent so I'll try another one but this story left me kind of flat. It features a protagonist known only as \\"Driver\\" who grew up poor and abandoned but liked fast cars and drove them well. He becomes a movie stuntman and moonlights driving getaway cars for a series of low-life thieves. Unfortunately, when a book is populated almost exclusively by uneducated, uninteresting deadbeats with no redeeming virtues it's hard to care what happens to them or the book. The late Charles Willeford did deadbeats well; Mr. Sallis doesn't.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The bad guy was determined early and yet the author had some twists and turns and a high level of excitement that made the ending a page turner anyway!
B007EECSFA|4.0|I love Kate Morton's books.  It flows from the daughter back to the mother's life as a young woman before she ever married and had children.  The mystery is ever present.  If you love Morton's way of catching and holding your interest, you will love this book.
0785125965|2.0|Get it to finish the story. But it simply doesn't live up to Planet Hulk. Shorter, little to no character development (for a graphic novel anyways), lack of that sympathy you had for Planet Hulk's gladiators. Just felt like it could and should have been much better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the first book and immediately ordered the next two books.  After reading all three, I wanted a book four.
0785156593|3.0|Definitely a good one, but it wasn't really what I was expecting. I liked Thanos' character however. Almost a little comic relief, whether it was intended or not... or I'm just really dry?

B008SOS63S|5.0|Really enjoyed tracks with John Hiatt and Beth Hart. Joe B's guitar work was exceptional! Well worth the price! Highly recommended.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It just seems more fun when part of the screen is not blocked by ads.I thoroughly enjoy all the versions of Angry Birds; especially the ad free versions.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|To be honest, not as terrifying as the first Alien, but more interesting, It takes lot of it´s elements, some of them quite visible and others subtle, one may miss the classic spiky longheaded drooling two mouthed monster... but as the Alien mithology goes, this add lots of new things, arcane ingeneers included, resulting in one of the most immaginative and possibilities opening way to present again this dark and monstrous universe... Is difficult just to begin to grasp all the new fantasies and imagination paths now laid in front of us. As it is, because this new movie, the cuadralogy we all know and love, and the two addings with predator, are just a couple of many possible outcomes, ramifications and plausible histories. I really hope this is just the first of many!!!Totally enjoyable, and the extras... mind blowing!!!

0316228532|1.0|I loved the Harry Potter series, not just for the stories, but for Jo's brilliant writing.  She had a way of making you care about the characters so much that you could not wait for the next page.<br /><br />I was hoping to see that her brilliant writing would carry over to a completely different book.  Much like Dan Brown, who had me on the edge of my seat in every one of his books.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />This book is a colossal disappointment.  There is no other word to describe it... boring.  Every time the story went back to a previously mentioned character, I had to flip back twenty pages to remember who they were.<br /><br />I finally gave up.  I didn't even make it halfway through.  And, based on the other reviews I'm reading here and elsewhere, doesn't look like I missed any cliffhangers.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent book, could not put it down once I started.  Probably one of Grisham's better books.  Hope to see more in the future.

0316228532|1.0|I really wanted this book to be so much more than it was. It's hard to top yourself when you start out with something like the Harry Potter series, and it's understandable that Rowling would want to distance herself from that genre as an author, but its almost as if she wasn't even trying for a good story here. It had none of her charm, her humor, her voice. Rowling is trying to make a political statement here and maybe she accomplished what she intended to, but it was far from an enjoyable read.<br /><br />The book started out slow and extremely detailed. Right away all of the characters (there are many) were unlikable. I kept waiting for them to redeem themselves as human beings, but it never happened. I kept waiting for the mood to lighten up, for someone to crack a joke, but no. Even the sympathetic characters, and it took me a while into the book before I even figured out which a-holes I was supposed to be rooting for, acted like jerks to the people around them. Perhaps JK Rowling was attempting to portray the misery of the human condition in general. If so, good job, but it wasn't pleasant to read. I would never want to go to Pagford or have anything to do with any of the characters, and the thought of people like that actually existing is horribly depressing. The whole premise is mundane and boring sounding, but I was so hoping the in the hands of the right author it could be humorous. No. It was all the unpleasantness of actual small town politics in book form.<br /><br />The detailed scenes, many of which I considered unnecessary to the plot continued all the way to the end. It feels as though she didn't bother with editing. JK Rowling is a good writer, and what she has a way of bringing a scene to life in a unique way. Her writing style was the only reason I finished this book at all. Any other writer and I would have thrown it against a wall long before the end. It did feel as if she were throwing big words around without purpose just to show off. I love a good vocabulary but much of it felt out of context.<br /><br />The ending was emotional, but I had no sense that anything had been accomplished, that any of the characters had learned anything, I just felt depressed. Life is shitty and then it gets worse. Everyone hates everyone else, and attempted to make life miserable for everyone around them all the time. No one connected with anyone else on a significant emotional level. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone. It wasn't fun. It was far too long and it went nowhere. The only redeeming thing about The Casual Vacancy is its author. JK please go back to children's lit!<br /><br />tl/dr: Depressing, tedious, generally unpleasant.a good vocabulary but much of it felt out of context.<br /><br />The ending was emotional, but I had no sense that anything had been accomplished, that any of the characters had learned anything, I just felt depressed.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is probably the best or one of the best series that we have ever watched.<br />Also the directors don't play cheap tactics by ending each episode with a suspense, so that you are compelled to watch the next one immediately.<br /><br />They do end each episode on an interesting note though.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Truly enjoyed this novel.  I'm a reader of detective/mystery books and this one did not disappoint.  Love the rough character of Harry Hole.  Have just started the next one, The Phantom.

I would like my body to be used in that way to help others. I had never heard of this before. I feel for her family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The price is a bit high but the game is great! I can see how this game is a 4 1/2 star game. I think it should be 5 stars instead of 4 1/2 stars.
B00479SVBU|3.0|I've tried a few FM transmitters before and the music quality that came out of them was scratchy and undesirable. This product, however, works like a charm! I thought I was taking a huge gamble by getting a wireless FM transmitter again, but it was well worth it. The sound quality is very good. There are multiple options such as forwarding, rewinding, repeat, shuffle, etc. You can even have inserted a USB AND an SD card at the same time; there's a button on the device itself and the remote for you to switch modes.<br />Worth the price, definitely. (Especially because it was just plug and play, no installation confusion :])<br /><br />Edit (Nov. 26, 2012):<br />Today, I changed the song, and the device froze up. Pressing any buttons wouldn't make a difference. So I pulled it out of the socket and reinserted the device. It didn't even turn on... What a bummer. Mine didn't even last a full 3 weeks, and I only use it every few days. It's probably just a fluke. I don't see anyone else with this problem on here =/

B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't listen to music radio or Pandora, where a lot of people get exposed to new music. As such, I rarely buy new music, much less an entire album.<br /><br />I encountered Lindsey for the first time when her Moon Dance video popped up in a halloween article on one of the blogs I read. I really liked it so I checked out a couple more of her songs.<br /><br />Simply put, I've never decided to buy an album so fast. Lindsey's music is breathtaking and fresh. I don't really listen to dubstep, nor solo violinists, but somehow when Lindsey put them together it became my favorite music!<br /><br />Also, in my humble opinion, there are no bad tracks on this album. You know how a lot of artists will often pad 3-4 really good songs with twice as many mediocre songs? Yeah - Lindsey doesn't do that. Every song on this album is quality.<br /><br />I love this album so much that I've listened to the whole thing every day since purchasing it. It's the first album I've enjoyed enough to bother writing a review for.<br /><br />Buy it! You won't be disappointed!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Just downloaded, tried to sign up and saw a screen that says tap the pics you love. A small group of red pics in a collage and empty boxes at the bottom of screen. Tapped everywhere on screen, nothing...... please help. Would love to be able to use. Heard many, many good things about Pinterest.

B000AOA2G8|2.0|This tool broke the second time I used it, not too impressed. Normailly I would endose Park Tools, I have been using them for over twenty years.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This will be my alarm clock for life. I and my wife have been using it over a year and we've never slept in too late! An excellent option instead of plain old snooze makes you solve math problems of custom difficulty. Math is hard to sleep through when an alarm is going off!
B009186JYI|4.0|The quality of the film and sound are pretty good considering it was made in 1965. Pretty good in equal interviews of each Stone. Neat behind the scenes footage. Another great item for the real Rolling Stone's collector.
0812984412|4.0|Cloud Atlas is one part Rubik's Cube, one part Zen Koan.  It's a novel, but it is also a collection of madly different stories that are loosely tied together through time and space.  (I use the term `loosely' loosely).  More than once, while reading Cloud Atlas, I wondered how I could get a glass of whatever David Mitchell was drinking, in hopes that I might stumble upon the secret to possessing such an unfettered imagination.  I, too, wanted to soar with the eagles of possibility and sink to the darkest recesses of the sea of despair without a backward glance at who was following.    I read the first two stories in this fragmented opus, \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" and \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\", with a dictionary at my side, racking up new vocabulary words with every other sentence.  I could not fathom where some of those sentences came from, or where they were going, for that matter.  I didn't let it bother me.  I bit my nails throughout the third story, \\"Half-Lives: The First Louisa Rey Mystery\\".  The fourth story, \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\", made me laugh out loud.  The fifth, \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\", I read with open-mouthed wonder.  It was all I could do to just keep up.  I read the sixth story with my eyes crossed, allowing me to hear the words in my head as much as read them with my eyes. That story, \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\", breaks the main rule about writing in dialect.  The one that states: Thou Shall Not Write in Dialect.  Unless you are David Mitchell, apparently.    And all of that only gets you to the halfway mark.  You'll have to read it yourself to find out where it goes from there.  Hopefully you are getting the idea that this book is all over the map linguistically, crosses genres without a thought, and challenges the reader in most every way imaginable.    But wait!  In addition to all this fancy trans-genre, trans-lingual writing going on, there's a theme.  An earth shaking, eye opening, heart breaking theme.  In fact, there are several, and all of them are deep, meaningful, and fully integral to the story(s).  Of course Mitchell is getting at the connectedness of everything:  he is oh-so-clever about tying these stories together, threading the characters through time, and making their singular struggles eternal.  But this book is also about the evolution of our species, the result and byproducts of the white man's conquest of the world, and the karmic wheel of fate.  That, and about ten other deeply profound things that just make you jealous of David Mitchell's creative mind.    You can see my full review, and other reviews and book suggestions, on my blog:  [...]

B008OOYALE|3.0|you need so much money to clear your land. and it keeps going up 2000 to clear a little patch next little patch is 4000 then 6000 and its 75000 to clear a rock and 15000 to clear a tree. you cant get enough gold.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am a evening person. Now I am finally becoming a early person. my dream doing some personal development things become reality.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|If you enjoyed books 1&2, you will enjoy this book and the peek at book 4 at the end! Can't wait for book 4 to come out!!!
B00866H7SS|4.0|Great read!! Couldn't put it down until the last page cant wait to read the next one. Way better than 50 shades
B000FC146C|5.0|I really enjoyed this saga about a family in Australia.  I remember when I worked at a small library in the 70's, that we couldn't keep this book on the shelf.  Now I know why.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My daughter and I totally love Dragon Story. We think the dragons are adorable! A fun addictive game.  I hate that they are constantly trying to pressure you to buy gold though.  It does give you an opportunity to talk to your kids about marketing.  So this would not be appropriate for kids that are too young to understand that they are being manipulated, and to have the self-control to resist!
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Unfortunately, there's no sweet emotion when it comes to this new material from the boys of Boston? Bottomline, Aerosmith is one of my favorite classic rocking bands of all time, but this is very disappointing release INMOP! Other than \\"Street Jesus\\", just can't find a great grooving track to get into/odd sounding? Also, more ridiculous, boring ballads! WHY? Anyhow, Music From Another Dimension is just out there alright and goes nowhere INMOP.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I find the entire series completely horrifying and shocking which is why it succeeds. The agony, despair and hopelessness entwined in the story line absolutely depresses me and keeps me engaged. This episode was over the top. The Walking Dead is a wonderful escape from reality that I am happy to purchase since I do not subscribe to TV service.
B00009Z574|5.0|Squire, White, Anderson, Howe & Wakeman that was YES, after that just a faded echo!<br />I still have the 1978 vinyl release and now the CD version, of course. My wife and my two boys, generations completely apart, simply love it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all Kate Morton's books and am never disappointed!  I love her writing style,  she makes it hard to put the books down!
0061743526|5.0|If you only read one book this year, read this one. It's a timeless classic about doing what is right, vs doing what is easy. Each time I read it I find something new. Atticus Finch is a true hero. Wish this was available for Kindles - my paperback copy is held together with a rubber band.
0345803507|1.0|Dear reader...:)<br />hmmm..what does one say about a book such as this?<br />It's a book that has and WILL enthrall people who have bland lives and who need such 'excitement' to spice their own life scenario. However, the writing is anything BUT writing and indeed the author has not expressed any DEPTH pertaining to the human psyche. I won't mince words..simply am NOT impressed.<br />It COULD have been pure genious  if she delved deeper..<br /><br />To each his own :))))
0345803485|1.0|I don't want to repeat what others have said, just want to confirm that it's all true! I wanted to post a review & after reading through some of the negative ones, others have already said it! This book is not worth reading, I managed to get through it but I have absolutely no interest in reading the rest in the series. Seems like it was written by a teenager.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As always, loved reading anything written by Patricia Cornwell.  Once I started, I could not put it down.  Suspenseful till the end.  Cannot wait till her next book comes out!!
B009LAP7OE|5.0|I love the show and I like the way they brought everyone up to speed if you have not not seen the first season and at the same time focused on each character and made it new for those of us looking forward to the new season. This was a great video to add to my collection.  Even thought I did not purchase the HD the quality is good.
B0092C2X7U|2.0|This I a good app for people who like a challenge. it is very hard and right when you think your done you have another object that you have to jump off of. its annoying frustrating and a little boring.
B00846REIS|3.0|My first thought is she trying to duplicate Fifty Shades triology?  No. And not near as good a read, more of a sophisticated story line, the players are more experienced and not the innocent that was in Fifty Shades.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Been awhile since I've played, and from what I've seen so far looks like i will get back into playing again! Nice feature set, smooth animations - I would like to see landscape display support for my tablet (Asus Transformer), which I use with keyboard all the time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What else can one say?  Although the second one is the group is better than the first, and if you can get thru the first 5 chapters of the first book it gets better.  They are extremely slow, then it picks up around chapter 5 and 6 and moves quickly from there on out.
B008Y1YJZY|1.0|Before you read, I am taking a traditionalists PoV.  Albeit a cute looking movie with potential but hesitant to see it in the movie theater after watching the previews, I am quite glad that I did not allow my children to watch this first.  My comments:  a lot of adult humor including mentions of the Grandpa Santa drinking or being drunk; the current Santa is shown as a figurehead (like the queen since the movie is British) with the elves doing ALL of the work - Santa places a \\"token\\" gift under the tree in each city after being awoken from a sleeping stupor in a chair at one house; Santa misses one child and his eldest son convinces him that the percentages are so good that missing one child 'isn't that big of a deal' and the family goes off to sleep including SANTA (Arthur and Grandpa Santa save the day); there is no more sleigh and reindeer but a spaceship looking thing that's a big as a small town; a chihuahua grabs hold of one of Arthur's slippers and 'mounts' it - how is that for children?; Grandpa Santa who appears to have dementia at times (or drunk) takes some decedents of the original reindeer (who he calls Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Commit, Bambi, the one with the white ear, the other deer, and the other deer) with the help of Arthur to deliver the missing gift, all of the reindeer end up falling off the sleigh (two get chased by lions in Africa to be saved by flying dust before they get eaten); one gets run into an inflatable Santa; and the others fly off through various accidents; grandpa Santa looks to replace one of the reindeer by STEALING a reindeer display from someone's house while getting SHOT AT by the homeowner.  My children would come out of watching this with more questions than answers - how can Santa say missing one child is not a big deal?  Will he miss me and not care?  What happened to the reindeer?  Did they get hurt or eaten by the lions?  Why are there three Santas?  Does he die?  What happened to the sleigh and reindeer?  Will he come in a spaceship now?  Why doesn't Santa deliver the gifts anymore, the elves do all the work?  BE WARNED!  This movie has been given away and is far away from my Santa believing children.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|I've have been watching the Terminator movies for a very long time now.  This DVD lives up to what we expect from directors and producers when it comes to a great action movie.  I have watched the movies mutiple times over the years as I have grown older, I do believe I started watching the series when I was just a teenager I am now 30.  Even now in 2012 I havent grown tired of the series or action scenes.  Not exculding the bonus material was a very nice add on to the fans of the Terminator Series.  It has for it's time and it came out in 1991 some of best action scenes ever and I am very selective of my action movies.  So if you have yet to see Terminator 2 Judgement Day then pick this DVD up and sit back make some pop corn grab a drink and savor some great action scenes, good plotline and amazing special effects that will blow you away.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Thought I may get bored since I've seen it so many times....watched it with my kids and feel in love with it again!
B007TK77QE|4.0|JK Rowling is an observer of human beings and particularly astute about teenage boys who have nothing whatsoever in common with Harry Potter. This is a character-driven book, with lots of sad people to choose from. Funny, insightful, and depressing in equal measures. A gripping and grim read, but memorable and I look forward to more from Rowling for a post-Harry audience.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Awesome.  It's Doctor Who  - so what did you expect? This is perfect for any new Whovian, or even non-Whovian science fiction fan.
B008MM9630|5.0|they tell you what the goals are so you aren't just wandering around wasting energy. cute graphics and acheiveable goals.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the games layout and features. I flows beautifully and has the necessary features that a game like this would need. The energy system needs tweaking though. I think even though it creates good business opportunities, I think it should transfer to coins, however expensive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|have not played game....but why the hell not give it a five star...but cant wait to play minecraft. ya bubby
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great show, I can't stop watching it. The acting is awsome and the writing is the best that I have seen in many years. I only hope that the current season's story telling continues at such a high level. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This movie will become a cult classic. There are 2 sequels in the works.  Absolutely the best low budget sci-fi action-adventure comedy political satire you will ever see.  Mel Brooks meets Dr. Strangelove with Sarah Palin playing the crazy general.<br />I suggest you google Nazi UFOs, helium 3, and Viktor Schauberger Repulsin engine before watching the movie.
B008EKON56|3.0|I bought this adapter to try something: I wanted to set up my iPod nano on my desk, the output going through a small amplifier to some desktop speakers, without routing through my PC. I also wanted to have the iPod be charged constantly so I didn't have to unclip it everyday to recharge it. There are two signal outputs available on the iPod:<br /><br />1-the 'internal' output, which comes through the base adapter and can be intercepted either through a PC or by using a commonly-available Y adapter (I was using one of those). This is a signal output only, fixed volume, is not controlled by the volume/menu dial on the iPod, and bypasses all the iPod internal equalizer (EQ) settings including such things as 'enhanced bass' or volume gain control; it is raw signal only. Apple intended your PC audio player (presumably under iTunes) to do that.<br />2-the 1/8\\" miniature stereo plug that appears on the bottom of the iPod alongside the base adapter slot. This is intended for the earbuds/earphones and *does* use the EQ, volume and gain settings.<br /><br />I wanted the EQ settings and the volume gain controls to work, and to use the iPod volume dial rather than the volume dial on the amp (I hoped it wouldn't be necessary given the EQ gain settings anyway).<br /><br />I thought that I'd use this adapter to see if there was any difference in audio output from the Y adapter I was using (they are of notoriously poor construction). There is none, this adapter operates identically to the Y adapter, with the exception that you need a power source that ends with a mini-USB terminal (not the thinner micro as is on most all cellphones these days) rather than the Apple dock cord with their proprietary adapter, which of course is built into the top of this adapter.<br /><br />BTW, in case there's any confusion, the manufacturer shows two views of the one adapter in the same photo so you can see both the power input (a mini USB) and the audio output (mini-stereo) that are located on opposite sides (there's nothing on the bottom of the adapter), you don't get two adapters. The placement of the mini-USB power input on the adapter blocks the headphone audio output on the iPod so that it cannot be used, I don't think that was the intent but it is placed that way just the same, thus you can only use the 'internal' line-audio. The audio output on this adapter is the internal, fixed, signal-only that bypasses all the EQ, volume and gain controls, it is useful as a feed for your car or amplifier with EQ, volume and gain controls, not headphones.<br /><br />The adapter is fine for what it does, and seems reasonably well built, but except for compactness and looks, offers no particular advantage over the much less costly Y adapters.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Ok, so I said I like it, really cannot say I love a product.  John Grisham does it again.  Would rather have had the hard cover book instead of on my kindle but for my current location, they have yet to get them in stock, other than that, a great read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|True Grisham style.  He is a good writer and I have all of his books.  This one holds your attention and has a good story line.
B0031RS44S|5.0|Lee Child has crafted Jack Reacher brilliantly.<br />The stories are excellent and the writing style is a pleasure to read.<br />I just wish Lee could write faster!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|fun classic app! This kept me busy during my commute to work for over an hour. If you enjoy playing chess then its worth the download!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was an ok story. When I was a teenager or young adult, I would have loved it. It did keep my interest however...so three stars is fair.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|J.J. Abrams was inspired to create the story of Cloverfield while visiting Japan, and witnessing the fervent love that the culture had for its national monster, Godzilla. In that regard, I feel that he has succeeded, which is why I am rating this movie five stars. The Clover monster is an awe-inspiring, rampaging beastie that lays waste to NYC with grand aplomb, and is of such size and stature that it could have been ripped straight from the Cluthu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft. I loved the monster's design (a touch of which can be seen in the creature from \\"Super 8\\", another Abrams creation), and the way that it was sparingly revealed, one brief glimpse at a time (with CGI done right, mind you). But rather than copping out and leaving the monster's true form to the audience's imagination, Cloverfield swings for the fences, delivering a full reveal in the film's finale. In my opinion, this reveal was a success, which was difficult to achieve, given all the (extraordinarily well done hype) that preceded this movie's arrival. Those who are curious as to the monster's origins can scour the found footage (and internet) for clues, which is a great touch.<br /><br />I feel that the major complaint with Cloverfield is that the characters are too annoying to empathize with. While this is certainly true, I don't think that Abrams ever intended for us to empathize with them... we're supposed to empathize with the monster, who is lost and scared, and simply lashing out in this new environment full of things that seek to hurt him. Just like in the tradition of the Godzilla movies, the monster is the true \\"hero\\", not the people!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting, easy to read, great plot, awesome suspense, keeps you hooked until the end, I immediately bought the next two books!!! And the more I read the more I like it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All three books were very erotic to the point of overload, but a very nice love story. Looking forward tp it on the big screen, but not with so much sex.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|These guys continue to deliver amazing albums. Great mix of hard and soft. Corey Taylor is one hell of a song writer, always has been. I absolutely love this album!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you have an opinion of the story, where it's going, what you think, there's a twist and your left surprised...and wrong. Very twisty, as my husband would say. Keeps the reader engaged and always wanting to turn the page to see what happens next. I couldn't put it down.
B005ES0Z9O|2.0|I am a women who wears size 9 , and I have wide feet. These crocs are very wide , much more so then regular crocs. The size 9 was accurate , but width was way off for woman's size, even with thick socks .  I have to return.
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|Great book. I haven't found any typos yet so the kindle version is holding up well. Once you pick it up it's hard to put down.
B00122RFRQ|4.0|This album gets a lot of unfair criticism.  Is it Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot or Selling England by the Pound? No it isnt.  But its much closer to that classic period output than the late 80s tripe Genesis was cranking out for Top 40 rotation.<br /><br />Most Genesis purists want to bemoan Gabriel's departure as the death knell of the band.  It was not.  Steve Hackett's leaving signalled a far greater change.<br /><br />After Gabriel, Genesis continued with a tremendous prog output in Trick of the Tail, which imho is far superior to Lamb. I confess I cannot listen to Lamb all the way through in a single sitting. It is just too much hard work for me.(The purists are mourning right now in sackcloth and ashes over that last statement while they listen to Back in NYC.) I would much rather listen to Seconds Out repeatedly.<br /><br />However, Trick, Wind and Wuthering and Then There Were Three provide a second \\"lesser\\" trio of serious prog albums.  Be honest, take all of the Genesis clones like The Watch, Citizen Cain,& Crucible, plus the plethora of neo-prog bands out there and compare this album to anything they have produced and you have to admit that TTWT is good.  And proggier than you think.<br /><br />No doubt, after this a slippery slope emerged with Duke and Abacab that began the slide down to (gag) Illegal Alien.  But if you will give TTWT are serious chance, you will find this is really a very memorable Genesis album. And probably the last which could still be classified as prog.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is one of my favorite games....the graphics are excellent and the colors are beautiful! I like the community / neighbor interaction and the fact that it can be enjoyed completely free. The only real drawbacks I see are the inability to cancel a breeding process (or egg) and being restricted to gifting gold to only 3 neighbors per day. Otherwise this is not only a great timekiller but also a very family friendly game. If TeamLava would address those 2 issues it would make an awesome game perfect.
B000W29V3I|5.0|Wishbone Ash is a wonderful gem of a band that is so often times overlooked by the mainstream listening audience and the music press. And thats just fine with me.<br /><br />This in my opinion was their apex.  No other album of theirs flowed perfectly like Argus.  Its a sonic treat of dual guitar mastery and superb vocal work.  I wont reiterate all the other favorable comments from other reviewers. But no serious music fan should be without this record.<br /><br />I would take slight exception with calling this a progressive rock album.  It is certainly progressive music in the sense that it is pushing the envelope in the early 70s, but it is not progressive rock in the vein of Yes, ELP or even Renaissance or Strawbs. If the latter is what you are looking for then you may be surprised.<br /><br />This is one of only two albums that I have purchased on vinyl, cassette and cd formats.  Its that good.<br /><br />And it contains one of those great anthemic moments when Martin sings \\"I have to be a warrior, a slave I could not be; a soldier and a conqueror fighting to be free\\"<br /><br />Enjoy
B001NKI60W|5.0|I saw this movie after taking a trip with several girlfriends. We spent the entire trip listening to ABBA's greatest hits so of course I then had to watch the movie. What fun! I loved it. Sitting and singing to all the songs and the cast was wonderful. So worth the money, even if just for the music alone.
0785163174|1.0|Beware of some spoilerish information:<br /><br />I really thought that something like FLASHPOINT or SECRET WARS II or BLOODLINES or ATLANTIS ATTACKS would be the bottom of the barrel as far as major company superhero \\"Event\\" comics could go. I thought that things would get better. AVENGERS VS. X-MEN, on paper, had everything going for it: some of the best writers at Marvel (Brian Bendis, Ed Brubaker, Jonathan Hickman, Jason Aaron, and Matt Fraction) along with some great artists (John Romita Jr., Olivier Coipel, and Andy Kubert) coming together to pit the two big teams of the Marvel Universe against each other as the threat of The Phoenix Force looms over them all. Sounds like this should be a huge winner, right?<br /><br />Right?<br /><br />Well, as it turns out, the brain trust over at Marvel (or their \\"Architects\\") went into full-on Battle Mode PVP-style writing with little-to-no regard for any real characterization. It's meant to be a clash for survival, but it bobs and weaves through these characters and tries to present it as a clash of ideologies. And when all is said and done, it's really just an excuse for heroes to clash, and the writers have to work backwards from that idea and hope that it all actually makes for a compelling story.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't. In any way. At all.<br /><br />Cyclops, leader of the X-Men, has determined that Hope, the only mutant born after the whole HOUSE OF M debacle where The Scarlet Witch decided in her nervous breakdown that there should be \\"No More Mutants\\", will be the vessel in which The Phoenix Force will reside and it will literally give hope for the eviscerated mutant population. Captain America and Iron Man, over on The Avengers side, see The Phoenix Force only as a force of destruction since several years before, Jean Grey played host to The Phoenix Force, and as Dark Phoenix, she destroyed a planet with billions of lives snuffed out.<br /><br />Now it seems that the pragmatic thing to do would be to have a summit or conversation of sorts between these two insanely powerful groups rather than risking another CIVIL WAR-type confrontation of Hero Against Hero. But these are superhero comics. And apparently, in superhero comics, you can't actually talk about things; you have to fight about it. Captain America and most of the Avengers (including the New Avengers and Secret Avengers) come to Utopia, basically to take Hope into custody and try and figure out what the next course of action is to stop The Phoenix Force. At least, that's how they make it try and sound at first. When Cyclops tells them to leave since The Phoenix Force has always been a mutant issue, Cap comes off like a fascist, jack-booted thug and tells Cyclops that if they don't comply, they'll take Hope by force.<br /><br />Well, the optic blast goes flying and that's it. The Avengers and The X-Men are at war. But things start turning really bad, not only in the actual story, but in the storytelling, and that's what's important. Perhaps one of the worst things they could have done is have involved all these writers. Writing by committee is historically not a good thing. Character voices and intentions change; additional plots get tacked on that service the writer's voice at the expense of plot and character development. After all, this thing has to go on for 13 issues (A #0 issue + 12 regular issues), and additionally, there HAVE to be tie-in series, and that means a series which is the ultimate in cash-grabbing and represents the worst that comics have to offer and that's the six-issue AVX: VS series, which does almost nothing to actually advance the story or give any real insight into character, but instead gives some fans the ability to \\"enjoy\\" watching Mutant A and Avenger B beating the living hell out of each other. Those issues are collected here as well. You are also treated to AVENGERS VS X-MEN INFINITE, which is the formerly digital only tie-ins to the story, which I have not read many of, but I do recall some of it having to do a little with the new Nova (man, I'm bummed that Richard Rider is gone).<br /><br />As things get increasingly insane, and as it hops back and forth between Utopia, K'un L'un, Wakanda and the Southwestern US, allegiances are broken, friendships and possibly marriages are broken beyond repair, and a \\"shocking\\" death signals a supposedly radical shift in Marvel's status quo.<br /><br />This is a series that literally showcases the absolute worst that not only all of the writers', but most of the artists' work has to offer. Romita's usually clean artwork seems hurried and scratchy. Kubert's work is good, but is nothing really special, and just downright silly in a few places. The only exception here is Coipel, who does do some really nice work.<br /><br />There is a random issue in this series (I believe it's issue 7 or 8) that is pretty good, but other than that, it's FUBAR. Bendis turns in some of the worst work here, but in peripheral issues of NEW AVENGERS, he does some incredible issues. Aaron is the only trustworthy worker bee here, who not only gives this whole series its only good issue, but his peripheral work on WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN still remains very well done.<br /><br />Some of you reading this may surmise that I set out to hate this. Nothing could be further from the truth. I desperately wanted to enjoy it, but I saw too many characters being marginalized or made villainous, and too much confusion in the plot, where it seemed to promise one thing, but gave something else. The one thing that I will concede to this series is that it did change or, more specifically, undo something that has been status quo and can potentially create something exciting. But I don't know if the birth of those new ideas are worth the labor pains of this series.<br /><br />Now, like DC's FLASHPOINT, this \\"event\\" is paving the way for the MARVEL NOW! initiative, which will give us a lot of new #1 issues for a lot of characters and a lot of books. Of course DC's New 52, which while having nothing to do with the events of FLASHPOINT still came on the heels of FLASHPOINT, was a pretty phenomenal success as far as getting people talking about comics again and drumming up some new readers and more sales, and that's really what's at work here. The whole sound and fury of AVENGERS VS X-MEN is about the same thing: New readers, more sales. Whether or not that will actually be successful for Marvel remains to be seen.<br /><br />But if the quality of those books are anything like this, Marvel will have to count a lot more on its film and toy division to make money.<br /><br />As an addendum, I do have to say that this whole \\"clash of ideologies\\" thing as far as hero fighting hero has worked very well in the past with CIVIL WAR. It was a battle that worked on every level (with a few strange exceptions) and created a whole new conversation for the heroes to have. Despite the fact that there were some really poor character moments, it all ended when Captain America so rightly observed that they weren't fighting for any real ideology or belief anymore; he realized that they were just fighting. That's where that \\"Event\\" ended, and that was something of a brilliant ending. Here in this \\"event\\", the heroes indeed just fight, because the argument is barely there.<br /><br />AVENGERS VS X-MEN is really probably the worst major \\"event\\" comic I've ever read. And that's saying something.ut I do recall some of it having to do a little with the new Nova (man, I'm bummed that Richard Rider is gone).<br /><br />As things get increasingly insane, and as it hops back and forth between Utopia, K'un L'un, Wakanda and the Southwestern US, allegiances are broken, friendships and possibly marriages are broken beyond repair, and a \\"shocking\\" death signals a supposedly radical shift in Marvel's status quo.<br /><br />This is a series that literally showcases the absolute worst that not only all of the writers', but most of the artists' work has to offer. Romita's usually clean artwork seems hurried and scratchy. Kubert's work is good, but is nothing really special, and just downright silly in a few places. The only exception here is Coipel, who does do some really nice work.<br /><br />There is a random issue in this series (I believe it's issue 7 or 8) that is pretty good, but other than that, it's FUBAR. Bendis turns in some of the worst work here, but in peripheral issues of NEW AVENGERS, he does some incredible issues. Aaron is the only trustworthy worker bee here, who not only gives this whole series its only good issue, but his peripheral work on WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN still remains very well done.<br /><br />Some of you reading this may surmise that I set out to hate this. Nothing could be further from the truth. I desperately wanted to enjoy it, but I saw too many characters being marginalized or made villainous, and too much confusion in the plot, where it seemed to promise one thing, but gave something else. The one thing that I will concede to this series is that it did change or, more specifically, undo something that has been status quo and can potentially create something exciting. But I don't know if the birth of those new ideas are worth the labor pains of this series.<br /><br />Now, like DC's FLASHPOINT, this \\"event\\" is paving the way for the MARVEL NOW! initiative, which will give us a lot of new #1 issues for a lot of characters and a lot of books. Of course DC's New 52, which while having nothing to do with the events of FLASHPOINT still came on the heels of FLASHPOINT, was a pretty phenomenal success as far as getting people talking about comics again and drumming up some new readers and more sales, and that's really what's at work here. The whole sound and fury of AVENGERS VS X-MEN is about the same thing: New readers, more sales. Whether or not that will actually be successful for Marvel remains to be seen.<br /><br />But if the quality of those books are anything like this, Marvel will have to count a lot more on its film and toy division to make money.<br /><br />As an addendum, I do have to say that this whole \\"clash of ideologies\\" thing as far as hero fighting hero has worked very well in the past with CIVIL WAR. It was a battle that worked on every level (with a few strange exceptions) and created a whole new conversation for the heroes to have. Despite the fact that there were some really poor character moments, it all ended when Captain America so rightly observed that they weren't fighting for any real ideology or belief anymore; he realized that they were just fighting. That's where that \\"Event\\" ended, and that was something of a brilliant ending. Here in this \\"event\\", the heroes indeed just fight, because the argument is barely there.<br /><br />AVENGERS VS X-MEN is really probably the worst major \\"event\\" comic I've ever read. And that's saying something.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I was an original Kay Scarpetta fan until this book. I managed to hang in through all the weird writings about Lucy but the last few chapters of this book were terribly disappointing. I feel like I need to read the book all over again because even though I just finished it I truly can't believe how poor the writing really was. Awful
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is one of the better Jack Reacher books.  It is well written, has plenty of action and keeps you guessing as to what happens next.
B00846REIS|1.0|Authors goal must have been to throw in as many references to 50 shades as possible. For the most part, the references did not make sense to the story.<br /><br />Overall, complete waste of a read.
B004GFN11A|4.0|Great app, really nice interface. Fast, efficient, does what it promises. The only thing I would like to see is an easier way to back out of zoomed in typing screens. I actually have to back up a page on Kindle Fire before publishing.

1616960922|4.0|As much as I've enjoyed the Mistborn saga, The Way of Kings, and his work on the final Wheel of Time novels, Elantris is one of the few works by Brandon Sanderson that I have yet to read (along with Warbreaker).<br /><br />Fortunately, while The Emperor's Soul is set in the same world as Elantris, it is a completely separate story, and doesn't require any advance knowledge of the world Sanderson has created.<br /><br />Clocking in at under 200 pages, this lacks the intense world-building of his other work, but still manages to cram in a significant amount of detail regarding his magic system. A bit more philosophical in nature, the magic of forging, involving the use of soulstamps and essence marks, is absolutely fascinating to explore. Sanderson does a masterful job of taking something simple, yet impossible, and making it a wondrously imaginative act of creation. Here, the system of magic is revealed not through narrative exposition, but through conversations between Shai, the Forger, and Gaotona, her captor. It means a slow unveiling of what she does and how she does it, but the means of that unveiling is an integral part of the tale.<br /><br />Shai herself is an interesting character, more admirable than heroic. She is a character with whom we can sympathise, but one who does not prey on our sympathies. Less a victim than an opportunistic captive, she forges the means of her escape long before the end, but cannot bring herself to flee without satisfying her curiosity as to whether her greatest forgery will work. After all, it's one thing to forge great pieces of art, or to temporarily alter one's self . . . it's another thing entirely to forge a complete stranger's soul.<br /><br />It's a shame that this is such a short work, told almost exclusively from Shai's point of view, because I would have liked to see the character of Gaotona better explored. He is intriguing, a man transparent in his emotions, but rather reserved in his motivations, and one who work as both a foil and a friend to Shai. Given the restrictions of the story, he is never really developed beyond the stern, compassionate, grandfatherly character we so often encounter in fantasy, but he is given a chance to shine in the final chapters . . . one that makes us want to know more about him.<br /><br />Like a great play, the world here is largely relegated to a single room, and the characters are limited to a handful of key players. The drama all takes place on the stage, in plain view, relying on our connection to the characters, as well as our own curiosity, to keep us in our seats. In essence, just as we come to sympathise with Shai, we also come to share her curiosity about this impossible abomination which which she has been tasked.<br /><br />While there is some significant action towards the end, with those magically-augmented battles that Sanderson writes so well, this is largely a story of ideas. It flows along at a leisurely pace, but has more than enough wit and wonder to keep the reader engaged. All-in-all a fine read for Sanderson fans new and old, and one that has put Elantris back near the top of my to-read pile.both a foil and a friend to Shai.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|GREAT in the way that so many Wes Anderson movies are great.  No one would mistake this as anything but one of his films, but this time it is even more beautiful and interesting because the main characters are kids. How cool is that? It's funny and heartwarming and awkward in all the right ways.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|they work and represent a significant savings by buying 5 instead of 1 or 2. also side note I learned that the button on my toyota remote gets stuck and how to unstuck it instead of buying a new 300.00 remote.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Ms. Rowling's novel gives the reader real insight to the inner workings and relationships within a contemporary British township.  The characters are diverse and painfully real.  The plot, which seems quite simple at first, is really a complex puzzle that comes together as a result of events mainly initiated by a group of high school kids.  It took me a while to get into the book, but once there, I could not leave it!
030758836X|5.0|After months of reading YA and supernatural books in the vein of Sookie Stackhouse, I was craving a grown up novel that was literary, but exciting and easy to read, and I found it. This book kept me up until 2am last night, and got me so wound up with its twists and resolution I'm having trouble going to bed after finishing it tonight. I can't wait to read the other books by this author- the writing is excellent, the characters, even supporting, are well-balanced and easy to relate to without being \\"like me,\\" the way chick lit characters can be, or purely sympathetic or reasonable. They are complex characters caught up in thoughts and actions tangential to mine but let run away, and they are fascinating. Read the beginning and see if you like it. It would probably be great on audio too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Take my money, seriously. Angry Birds always delivers for our family and the Star Wars theme simply sweetens the deal. The kids are having a blast with this on our G1 Kindle Fire.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game hours of not boring and sucking. Like most others that sucked play them for a little while grow old and then delete.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This games loads quickly &amp; runs smoothly.  Good mental distracton but not frustratingly challenging. No unnecessary permisdions or networks. So, basically a perfect little game!
034580404X|5.0|the books were a gift. it is now bing read.iread all three and i liked them.i hope the move is as good.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Taking the tip from Leo Laporte Steve Gibson, I quickly grabbed the book sample fo my Kindle. After being sucked in to this gripping story, I grabbed his entire series!<br /><br />I'm not really a fan of the sex scenes in the story, but the sub-fictional story is absolutely a must-read for anyone interested in Technology, Security, or simply reading great books!<br /><br />I'm hooked!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I got two of the free versions a few days ago, and wanted to try them out and then decide which to get. This one was the one I liked best. Now it is the faoftd , perfect! This is a good chess game, you should get it. It is not the fanciest, but it has some nice features, and it is not expensive. You do get a really nice game here, great game play mechanics. I am not a chess playing genius, but can atleast win with some challenge in level 1. Yay!  I suggest getting this version, even if you buy it. Good luck, y'all!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|straight forward chess game. no frills. easy to use. I only play the one player mode but I cant imagine a huge difference between the two. best part is it is free!!!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I loved this book.  It has a human perspective that is inspiring. The dialog between the author and his friend and teacher is heartfelt and intimate.  The relationship that is described is simply wonderful.  I highly recommend this book.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Go ahead and buy it.  You know you want to anyway.  Peer pressure set aside, it's a great album.  Perfect background music.  The simplicity of each track is right-on.  Nothing overcomplicated, which is nice when you are in chill mode.  As you listen a bit more to the album you'll notice how each song's lyric begins to paint a lovely little story.  Honestly, if you like The Head and The Heart's music, chances are you'll like this album by the Lumineers.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Still only level 10, but if I run out of coins, I can come back later, coins have accumulated, and the game is still at the same point, ready to continue.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it. my whole family plays it. it gets faster as u go. and more challanging. worth the down load. takes awhile yo get coins. but fun time getting them
B008V0OLOW|4.0|This new recording certainly met and exceeded the expectations I have of Diana Krall. One is transported to that special place when listening to this recording. My ideal setting; a big leather couch, fire in the fireplace and a glass of wine while listening to Diana.
B003B02PFO|3.0|A good book for readers who are wondering if all the shopping, wrapping presents, and attending family or work parties are worth the effort. One couple decides to break with tradition. The results will have you laughing out loud as they try to save what's left of Christmas. The ending is very satisfying and will keep you thinking about it long after you close the book.

0440245915|4.0|The book was in great shape and arrived on shedule as promised...good job....will do it again in future.<br />I liked Grisham as a writer but this was not my favorite.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|If you are a true fan of Pete Townshend's work, you will love this memoir. There are tons of snippets about events and songs that make you look at them in a whole new way. Want to know what playing at Woodstock was like? Why Roger wore an eye patch in '96? What the cover of Tommy really means? Who the song Sensation was about?  Then this is the story for you!
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked \\"50 Shades\\" you will love Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel. I couldn't put it down. The story line and plot are interesting and the author keeps the reader engaged. This is a real page turner. I was very happy I bought the book and have recommended it to several friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing! so stop doing 1 star reviews!<br />so stop doing bad reviews!<br />p.s. i dknt understamd why it isnt working for you<br />though.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Paul Simon is always great and this CD/DVD Live in NY City was a wonderful performance. My wife and I loved it.
030758836X|3.0|I absolutely LOVED the first half of the book. Classic whodunit. But then the story takes a strange turn, it kept me interested in the most part until it turned into the most ludicrous decent into madness I have ever read. The story completely unravels about three quarters of the way through. I found myself hating every single character, but I think this may be what Gillian Flynn intended.<br /><br />The final nail in the coffin for me was the ending. I had heard from friends and family that the ending was horrible so I was trying to prepare myself. But no amount of preparation could have had me ready for the absolute, forgive me for being unable to find a better phrase, shit storm of an ending. So much build up for such a huge disappointment. I know not all endings will be happy, or even satisfying for that matter, but Flynn's ending just seemed like a bad combination of psychotic and lazy. It is as if she knew she had to end the book on a dark note but just did not want to write anymore.<br /><br />A real let down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While the story is spellbinding initially, the author seems to run out steam 2/3 of the way through. It becomes too melodramatic. The ending is simplistic and frustrating.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|We love the fact that they kill off a character that was pretty annoying to sheriff. And now it should be even more action because a new comer has been added to the group.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Reads a lot like an NPR segment. Heavy on the angst and introspection and occasionally a dead body gets in the way.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|...does what it's suppose to do and more. The paid version is better bacause it doesn't have ads.  I like that you can see all calculated entries.
B004NDVK1I|5.0|This album shows the LATE GREAT Rory Gallagher doing what he does best:Play the blues. His Acoustic work and his electric Slide Guitar are Excellent. They have withstood the test of time. Proof positive is the crowd's reaction. This album is a must have.
0307730697|4.0|This book is about the life of Adam Brown. The author touches each aspect of his life, from his troubled younger days to his resolve to be the best husband, father, and SEAL possible.<br /><br />The author doesn't push any agenda with this book. It is simply the story of Adam Brown as told by the people who knew him best.<br /><br />Anyone looking for an interesting story should consider looking at this book. From the title of the book you can probably figure out what happens to Brown, but it is the encouraging journey along the way that should be motivating to anyone reading.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is quick and simple. Easy to use.  Makes the transactions smooth and fast. Has just the right amount of information and you're not looking all over for what you want.  I love it!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This one kept me intrigued until the very end.  He did not give away the plot nor the culprit....kept you wondering and thinking.  And written in the typical Grisham style.  Great read!!!!!
B0097AQEOK|5.0|PLEASE someone post whether these are the HDCD remasters or something better or worse sonically. The musc we know is essential, especially at these prices, and allows you to explore lesser known albums of hers with little financial risk. I'll update if I find the answer to this.
B005LAIIA8|1.0|I cannot stand being held hostage by Disney for releasing this in a way that forces us to purchase the 3-D version. Are they that desperate to get back the 4 billion they just spent for Lucas that they have to screw the blu-ray consumer?<br />Come on people!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|OMG - this game is hilarious!  A must have for any fan of Star Wars or Angry Birds.  Gameplay is smooth on my budget tablet (Zeki).  Please add the paid version soon - or better yet, make the paid version a FAOTD!  :-)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game but needs more levels, it took around 4 hours.  the last puzzles were challenging<br /><br />please add more levels.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Sure it's a story about young and old love, about the boredom of marriage, about the weird kids ( and adults ) trying to fit in...but is it so fresh and so beautifully acted and photographed. It's totally over the top and yet there is such subtlety in the acting.  It's improbable and yet totally possible.  Bill Murray is a revelation of nuance.  I bought this movie after I saw it- beause I want it in my film library.

0525952926|3.0|The twentieth century moves to the middle third as Ken Follett follows the lives of the families he introduced in Fall of Giants as another generation matures in Winter of the World, the second installment of the trilogy. Readers have another thousand pages to follow the lives of characters in the run up to World War II and its aftermath. I can imagine a wall chart that Follett must have created to highlight the key events of the twentieth century, and then deciding how those events can be presented in the lives of his large cast of characters. For readers who read the first novel, this is the anticipated continuation of the story. New readers could begin here, but for the sake of continuity, it makes more sense to start with the first installment. With two thousand pages read, it's all downhill from here as fans await the third and final installment. If you like historical fiction, you're likely to enjoy an immersion in this one.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B009XY97VC|5.0|I'm adding this review to bump up the average. I like Legend's review and would basically echo it: this is a different album than Invincible and Archangel, and should be appreciated on its own. It's very good.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|glad this game finally was available to download - been waiting for this one for a long time.  it's good old fashioned fun for the whole family.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Bright, crisp colors and many options for changing card backs and backgrounds make this a fun game. It responds quickly and will auto-finish. I really like this one!
B007NG93CK|2.0|I occasionally succumb to reading Kathy's books though I am not a fan of the TV series Bones. Having just finished `Bones Are Forever', I am reminded of why that is the case. The storyline got buried under tons of techno babble that for some may be the point but for me marred an otherwise good plot. I am not averse to understanding how conclusions are reached by forensic science but it needs to be part of the plot and not subtext I felt I had to wade through before continuing.<br /><br />My other concern was descriptive. Kathy writes as though her readership is familiar with the places and institutions she writes about. Her visits to laboratories and public institutions are written as though to the initiated and throwing in a bunch of gratuitous French phrases every other page just highlights that I should have paid more attention to French in my youth - not!<br /><br />There is just an undercurrent in her narrative that grates at me as is the case with the TV series. Cannot point a specific bone but never-the-less the irritation remains.<br /><br />Not my favourite read but as she has a legion of fans what do I know.<br /><br />Peter Eerden
B00914JWSW|5.0|I have played this CD so much it is almost worn out.  I LOVE the way this Lady sings.  What a voice!  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to music the way it is meant to be performed.
0385535147|3.0|It's tough to present a jailed attorney as a heroic figure, but that's what John Grisham pulls off in his novel, The Racketeer. Malcolm Bannister resides in a federal prison in the fifth year of a ten-year sentence he feels he received unjustly for his involvement in a money laundering scheme. After a federal judge is murdered, Bannister knows who the murderer is, and the plot of the novel involves the intricate plan Bannister develops and executes to extract revenge on the government and reward for himself. Grisham presents a great protagonist in this novel, and a plot that can entertain any reader who likes this genre.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

B0031GUR44|3.0|Similar to other reviewer, I also only received one wiper blade instead of \\"set of 2\\". Amazon sent another order, and again it was only one wiper blade instead of \\"set of 2\\". This was fine since I now had two blades.<br /><br />However, I didn't bother try fitting it to my car until after receiving both at which point I found that the wiper doesn't fit my 2012 VW GTI. It seems very similar but the bracket seemed wrong for my car. And the size was slightly different from my OEM blade. So, returned the entire order to Amazon.<br /><br />Didn't want to give 1 star since I'm sure it works fine on whatever car(s) it does fit.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille was his usual amazing self - serious topic with the greatest humor you could want in a character. Don't stop!
B002RT2BXQ|2.0|The Fountainhead was an excellent book written by Ayn Rand many years ago.  I bought the movie because I had enjoyed the book so much.  Unfortunately, the dialog was very choppy & the acting was way over-the-top - like William Shatner on steroids.  Gary Cooper was OK, though disappointing, but the rest of the cast was awful - especially the female lead, Patricia Neal.  The one strong performance was the guy who played Elsworth Toohey (sorry - don't recall his name).  Otherwise, I'd suggest skipping the movie & reading the book (even though it's very long).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Brilliant, simple story. Great characters. Enjoyable for all 8+ age groups. This is a trilogy I will read again and again. Suzanne Collins is a far superior author to JK Rowling.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|reminds me of being a kid. soo fun. gotta try it. you will not be able to stop........  ..............  ...
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book I thought was very good, but like the first book very depressing. I wanted to keep reading to see if things would turn around.  I'm in the third book now, & like the first 2 very depressing & from the other reviews I guess it doesn't end with a happy ending but I will continue reading cause I'm dying to find out what happens.
B00984668E|4.0|First off, the album is pretty good, but not great. If you liked the previous ones, I'd recommend buying it. The last 5 live tracks are a nice nod to fans, but the live quality is so much worse than studio (particularly on voice) that I don't listen to them.<br /><br />This is the first album without their previous drummer Trivet Wingo. He was just awesome, technically great and had great creativity and variety in his drumming patterns. Not just extra fills or trills here and there, but complex rhythms that often changed multiple times in a song. It really gave the songs legs and depth. It was part of why their instrumental songs worked so well.<br /><br />The new drummer is a talent with no doubt, but lacks the same variety and creativity. This is the first album without instrumental songs and I wonder if that's in part due to the change in drummer. The guy has serious talent, hopefully as the new bang jells together that in the next album he'll return to the high bar that Trivet had set.

B00992CF6W|4.0|great app but needs some things<br /> .explodable tnt in creative mode<br /> .lava<br /> .buckets<br /> .armour<br />Other tan that this is one of the best tablet games ever.<br />THANKS FOR READING :)
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My son got hooked on this activity at Youth Group (yes, our Youth minister is a \\"big\\" little kid) and so we bought the Epic for our son, and the Original maze for our nephews (ages 4 and 7 years).  It's fun, safe, and unplugged!
B005PM3YII|5.0|It was a great conclusion to the series, really bought things together well.<br /><br />I will be looking at more of the authors titles as I thought he had a good style that I could really get into.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This was so bad that it was humorous.  I feel bad for all the Rock Bands who gave permission to use these incredible songs.  I'm sure it they had seen it first, they would've refused.  It's a wonder that the actors still have a career after doing this movie/musical.  I'm a hard core rocker and was very, very dissapointed to say the least.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I reviewed this CD once before. I didn't give it high ratings. Then I received a note from a Diana Krall fan pointing out what an idiot I am based on the review I gave. I went back and read my review and this person was right. I am an idiot. After a second listen I realized the errors of my ways. This is a highly entertaing Cd and Diana Krall is at her very best.However I stand by my origional comment, the cover photo is smokin' hot!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|loove it! I cant sleep with out it! I even have friends hooked :D I recommend this to everyone who loves a good rain storm or just likes some background sound that's relaxing and calming.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story hooks you from the beginning.  It reads fast. It is fun.  The main character is engaging.  Tasks undertaken by the girlfriend are a little unbelievable, but better than in \\"The Firm\\".  An entertaining read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|3 words its really amazing so you should get  its tottaly worth the price so u should get it and play it all day
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Did not hold my interest.  Took way to long to explain how what was happening had anything to do with the story.  Annoying rather than exciting.
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|Heard a lot about this movie so I decided to check it out it was pretty good there are some corny bits but not many , overall if your just looking for a good movie to watch look no further dudes this is the one
1451695195|5.0|I listened to the audiobook, read by the author, on a roadtrip.  At times, especially near the beginning of the story, the mundane details of who did what were a little annoying.  But, Dr. Alexander has written this to expose the whole truth of his story and these details help convince the reader of his commitment to family and honesty.  And I suppose one can forgive a brain surgeon for being detail-oriented!<br /><br />This book rang true on so many levels regarding Alexander's discoveries while comatose, as well as the painful beliefs described from before his illness, including feelings of separation from God and doubt about his own self-worth on some levels. Other teachers have said some version of this: everything we need to know already exists within us and simply needs to be given attention or reawakened. There was scarcely a paragraph in this book that didn't sound like something I already Know (capital K) inside.  It definitely reawakened a number of alternately exciting and comforting corners of my own self.<br /><br />I hope Alexander's unblinking account of his unique and eerily coincidental (example: his wife is friends with a person who does telepathy with coma patients) experience will awaken the souls of many in the medical field as well as outside.  He said, in different words, something echoed in the teachings of Abraham-Hicks: one cannot perceive what one isn't a vibrational match to.  I think this story has the potential to help humanity rise to higher levels of awareness and perception of the non-physical world.  What was new and useful to me, in contrast to other metaphysical/channeling teachers I've listened to, was Alexander's simple yet profound explanation of the purpose of evil on earth. There are many take-home messages in this book; to me the one about evil's place in our world is the most memorable.<br /><br />Get this book, read it and pass it on.
B004HX4RT6|1.0|I would have gotten it but I don know how to play dis game. I like checkers. Its not confusing like chess be.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|The free version of this game was one of my first games to download on google play.  Absolutely not missing the chance to pick up the full version.<br />Plays great on my HTC INSPIRE. The AI is &quot;winnable.&quot; But it should be difficult. That's the point. You learn your mistakes by losing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app is really worth getting if you cant afford the others like space and starwars . its a really good game and its free!
B0018OAOQC|5.0|I am just blown away by Volbeat!! I now have all of their CD's. They've found a way to combine country, metal, and rock-a-billy!! Excellent!! I missed them when they came to town. I won't miss them next time around!!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I had watched the making of this album of PBS and the entire album was wonderful. Diane Krall's piano is wonderful.
0920668372|5.0|I received this book a couple of days after ordering it. This is a wonderful story that not only kids will love but adults too.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|If you think of the game as if it's another store bought video game its highly entertaining. However, if you think of it as &quot;just another kindle app&quot;, the price will without a doubt seem outrageous. Depending on your angle, this is either a well-worth it game OR its an extremely overpriced app.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Like the title says, I couldn't put it down once I started. Was cool to read how the seals felt after the mission and how it played out in the media.<br />Good read, recommend it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this story game the best. Maybe because I like dragons more than fashion.  lol The dragons are cute. the eggs are pretty. you gain coin and experience quickly. Best of all, the gifts are gold. My major beef is that you can only return 3 gold a day to your neighbors. Otherwise this is a super game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitare is fast and I love that you can choose random or winning deal and that it will do an automatic finish for you.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A man has been wrongfully accused of a crime and he manipulates the system to get out of prison.  Very exciting, and John Grisham is masterful once again.
B008U0FJF8|2.0|I downloaded this CD after hearing an NPR interview with the artist. I was intrigued by his classical backround and by the inclusion of a few nice sounding snippets from the album. If I had known however that the snippets essentially WERE the album, I would not have pressed the 'open file' tab quite so fast.<br />If the artist was indeed classically trained he does not display it here and the album is most disappointing as a compositional statement. It consists of a series of simplistic chordal and/or melodic expositions. Sometimes two are strung together to expand the piece, more often emphatically not. In terms of thematic development, forget about it...there just isn't any. He relies on his soloists to propel the music forward, but there's not enough musical depth to float the improvisational boat so it goes nowhere. Therefore the pieces tend to be short and they end abruptly with no real sense of conclusion. Did anybody ever mention the word: coda? I think not. One cut towards the end of the album is a riff on one arpeggiated minor augmented piano chord which leads into a drum solo. This is good....he's a percussionist....at last something with at least a little passion! Then, instead of trying to segue back to the piano for a proper ending, it just suddenly stops with the drum solo. He's almost like a child with a whole box of Crayolas. He has no idea what to do with the chromatic tools at his disposal, so he just scribbles small patches of color on a sheet of paper, then he calls it art. It's not art! In order to do abstract expressionism you gotta be able to limn an accurate torso.<br />I'm not prepared to throw this CD in the trashcan. In it's favor, however amateurishly minimalist the pieces are they do display a soft and sort of haunting lyricism. It seems to be excellent sound by which to fall asleep. Of course, that's almost as bad as saying it's also good for going up and down in an elevator. But it does earn it a rating of sorts. With all the junk that's out there, that's actually saying something.....
B005HSL626|3.0|this game is very fun but it freezes at the opening when it says halfbrick and it brings me back to my mainscreen. it sucks because it is such a good game:(
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Not much to say--it's been hugely popular and is seriously entertaining. Interesting that there are lots of father-daughter relationship centered TV episodics and movies these days. Enjoy it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This  book is good and awful at the same time. In my opinion this book is ok when the obviously mental Mr. Grey isnt torturing the poor girl.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a book like Fifty Shades of Grey. I liked the Crossfire Novels more and I can't wait for the next book to be out.
0547396945|5.0|I got this book from the library, my child loved it so much that I ended up buying one. Where is the green sheep? Is a lovely educational book that guarantees fun while learning.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|All that glitters is not gold, but Grisham's newest, The Racketeer, is golden. It will keep you guessing till the last page. Enjoy!
B00846REIS|5.0|What a great read ..if you liked Fifty shades of gray you will love this series..too bad the last book will not be released until May 2013!! I can't wait!
B009KHCT94|1.0|this was the wost movies i have watched in a lo.ng rime. it is not worth the price of bubble gum to see.
B008XG1X18|5.0|easy to navigate - never any problems. I love being able to access pintrest whenever I want!!!! I wish the tumblr app worked like this.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television. Someone once said that one of the best things about the show is that it's a Post Zombie Apocalypse television show instead of movie. We all love the movies, but then they end and we're sad. The Walking Dead, as a tv show, just keeps continuing the Zombie movie's story every week. I would have to agree with his sentiment.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is the best creature creator game I have ever played. thank you for making such a game available for me and everyone else to play. I hope to more games like this one soon.
0345803485|1.0|It seemed like this book was written just for shock factor and didnt really have an original premise. I didnt even finish reading it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|GREAT GAME! I have finally found a kingdom game! this one really makes you feel like you're in it! Cant wait for more.
0817439390|5.0|This is the book that helped me understand manual exposure! I always recommend this book to new photogs, he explains things and a very easy to understand fashion....money well spent!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|That's really all you can say. It's so creative and the imagery is do vivid I couldn't put it down.  It is one of the most enjoyable books that I've read this year.
031618201X|5.0|The Soulless manga is a visual interpretation of the first book in the parasol protectorate series. Here, in Gail Carriger's London, bustle skirts flounce and dirigibles fly as you follow the heroine Alexia Tarrabotti as she chases after werewolves, vampires and comestibles. Alexia is refreshing in her role of Victorian lady and heroine. She values both manners and style; however they do not limit her in her ability to have adventures. I think it is her quirkiness that you immediately identify with. In the first few pages we see her as she navigates a lavish party in search of the library for some quiet, tea and perhaps treacle tart.  Soulless is my personal favorite in the series. The art of the manga is engaging and imaginative while maintaining the feel of the witty discourse that makes the books so enjoyable.
B009K0P10K|4.0|It has enough suspense that it kept me glued to it.  Don't ask me why, at the moment I can't recall.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a game that my wife and I both enjoy playing. It is a fun game that can be quite challenging when you play against the computer.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|AI Factory's Chess helps complete my collection! I already own their Backgammon and have always been impressed with that AI engine as well as the Chess engine (works on probability, not checking every move in advance). I am slowly purchasing each of their apps to replace the free versions I have, all by AI Factory, of course.<br /><br />The game play is smooth and honestly, I have no recommendations or complaints that others have not mentioned (but I'd like to iterate being able to setup our own scenarios).<br /><br />If you are looking for a great game supplier, I highly suggest you stick with these guys; if you need to see it with your own eyes, download the free versions.
B00913DPW2|3.0|i loved it until my items wouldnt show and my kindle would freeze. couldnt get all the way through the game which sucks because i was really enjoying it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I don't buy DVDs.  I usually acquire them digitally through *coughcough* other means.<br /><br />That being said, I bought The Avengers on Blu-Ray/DVD.  That should tell you everything you need to know about how I feel about this movie.<br /><br />Jeez, I don't even OWN a Blu-Ray player.  But I'll get one at some point, and this will be the first thing I watch.<br /><br />Now go hit Add to Cart, Proceed to Checkout, and Place Your Order.  You won't regret it.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I have my Jack Canfield coach hired and I have had my first coaching session.  With the aid of my coach and a fabulous book as another guide, l will succeed.  Thank you Jack for another great contribution to society.<br />Dr. Mary
B000ID37KO|5.0|My entire family loves this movie.  I had it on VHS and finally ordered it on DVD.  The information on how Hitchcock made this movie was as excellent as the movie.  Make sure you watch that also.  You won't be disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app puts together many useful tools for you to use when reading, and also to get a better understanding of the bible.
1564148793|5.0|VERY INTERESTING BOOK I JUST LOVE IT NEED TO MAKE MORE LIKE THIS, I LEARNED ALOT COMPARE TO OTHER BOOKS
B00004Y3OU|5.0|Of course, this is great movie - very touching, very well acted - love Philippe Noiret - with the timeless music of Ennio Moriccone that perfectly matches the story
B00846REIS|1.0|At first I was excited that this book was \\"suggested\\" to me because I really did enjoy the 50 shades trilogy. This book is so close to plagiarism it isn't funny. There is no build up to the encounter and each encounter leaves you unfulfilled and shocked that the Author could use such language. Take all the best parts of 50 shades, dull them down and this is the book you'll read. Very disappointing.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Mr. Follett brings history to life with his characters and the events.  It is so well written and the continuation of the first book's characters are easy to remember and follow.<br />We should all remember the past so we don't allow the horrible events to happen again.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|My entire family loves this movie.  I had it on VHS and finally ordered it on Blu Ray.  The information on how Hitchcock made this movie was as excellent as the movie.  Make sure you watch that also.  You won't be disappointed.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Very interesting and I really enjoyed it.. It was a very touching story.. I can't wait to read the next one
B000OXHRRC|5.0|A Good Year stars Russel Crowe with an unknown cast (in the USA) and that's part of the charm... no fake accents here! Crowe (okay, he fakes the accent) does a super job turning from a money/power obsessed London stock trader to a man in search of his soul. Nothing heavy or sickeningly sweet. Just a straight forward reflection on how he could have left his only living relative (Uncle Albert Finney) for the last ten years of the old man's life when he discovers that he is the sole beneficiary of his British relative's French vineyard/chateau.<br /><br />I always consider the scenery as another member of the cast and the south of France never disappoints! I would have hired myself to the vineyards as a manure spreader if I had the chance. So beautiful there!<br /><br />Not going to spoil it for you. Plenty of surprises with a great Lance Armstrong line, a funny car chase, and a funnier personal assistant who makes it all happen. I've already watched more than half a dozen times and I still get the good feelings of the first.<br /><br />Take a bad day and toss it in the micro popcorn with a cheeky Bordeaux and I guarantee you'll come out as new as the star of this delightful flick!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Brookside was a soap about boring people leading somewhat less boring lives. The casual vacancy is on par with that. What a waste of time. J.K needs to go back to what she is good at. This book just stinks
B005LAIHPY|5.0|For a 'summer epic' type movie it had a surprisingly good story as was well as very well filmed for the large amount of special effects it included.
B000001Y5X|3.0|I was pretty annoyed when my package shipped with no packaging, a broken jewel case, and price tags on the case(Which had no plastic covering). The cd is in ok condition but I ordered this new, not like new or used. There is no reason that should be considered acceptable.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't wait to find the time to read this story every day and never looked forward to it coming to an end.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it's really fun because it's hard. there's always a new quest awaiting your detective skills to solve it and there's so many secrets... but, I already know it so why bother saying it? (you'll have to learn them yourselves)
B004TSXUWY|5.0|absolutely loved this book, kept me intrigued and in suspense to the very end!<br />Would highly recommend to anyone. Would make a great film
0307592731|2.0|it is an ok book. must really like oprah to read it. maybe go get it from the library and save your money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is hot and quite suspenseful. I read the entire series in 4 days. I couldn't put it down!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are a lot of fun to play.  some are a little harder to figure out than others but overall very entertaining.
0486266885|3.0|Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde is a book about a \\"good\\" guy with some SERIOUS problems, his bestfriend is a very pleasant person, who helps out with this case. In the end its a pretty good book, a bit boring in the 8th chapter but other than that it was ok. Although I didn't like how Hyde and Jekyll were the same person.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|My 10 year old loves this gun. However, it's not stealthy (it's battery operated) and he SHOT ME IN THE EYE. The aim isn't great on it and he was aiming above my head and hit me in the eye instead. Awesome black eye.<br />We are now more careful about wearing safety glasses...
0525953728|3.0|Can't say much, it's a Christmas gift! Hope he likes it, let you know after the new year, when he reads it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun but don't waist all your points because than you have to wait for forever to get a new game
B009FZFONO|2.0|Well I love this show but when watching it on this site I get alot of my video saying for me to try again later. It does a lot of buffing so I should've stuck with the one that is not HD,it's cheaper and buffs just as much as the HD. I will not be purchasing the full seasons from u all. I'll stick with Netflix.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|It didn't fit my kindle even though it said it would in the review Very upset I would have loved it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a totally awesome page Turner. You'll never put it down until it's finished! Romance action and suspense keep you wanting more.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and then rented it at home when it came out digitally through amazon so my wife could watch it.  I will say that the first time I watched it I thought it was an awesome movie.  The 2nd watching was a little boring.  Obviously this movie depends on \\"shock value\\" to keep your attention.  I'm star-rating it based on my first watch-through but would say that the \\"rewatchability\\" of this movie is probably a \\"2\\" star.<br /><br />I was also hoping that watching it the second time would clear up some questions I had.  It didnt.  Maybe that's because I'm just dense.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|We found this artist on 60 Minutes, and was amazed at how popular & loved he was in South Africa,<br />while here in the states no one ever heard of him until the TV show. He is in my opinion like a<br />street version of Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. If you want to purchase his albums I highly<br />recommend Two: Cold Fact & Stixt Rodreguez 1971, you won't be dissapointed! You must listen to the words!
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Purchased this converter to play Battlefield 3 since I strongly dislike console controllers I decided to pick this up after I purchased from XCM XFPS RATEUP II ADVANCE which was 100 % pure garbage and had major issued from out of box. Eagle Eye took a lot of tweaking to get it to work but I am glad now I have complete control over the guns of battlefield 3 unlike before they would jump all over the place and I would find myself off target 90% of the time after the 2 shots from an automatic. This delivered much needed control to a very jumpy gun system that battlefield 3 has.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved it, read it in one day. Couldn't put it down. Nice surprising twist, John Grisham they way he should be.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Funny how life works.  I was \\"googling\\" something (can't remember what it was) but I came across a link to the New York Times article by Gary Taubes which in turn led me to Amazon to search for \\"Why We Get Fat\\".  I've been on the Atkins diet before and was successful and although not staying low carb all the time (with weight fluctuations to show for it !) I was always conscious of the carbs I was taking in.  Thing with Atkins though, I was doing the diet, and it was working but I didn't know why it was working.  I knew I was losing weight, my body shape was changing and I was happy with that but having read Why We Get Fat I now KNOW why I'm losing weight and my body is changing shape.  I also know now that hopefully I won't end up like my mother who takes so many pills for cholesterol, high blood pressure, etc. etc. etc. and hopefully won't be constantly struggling with my weight.<br /><br />This book has completely changed my way of thinking about eating.  While on Atkins, I ate low carb but always at the back of my mind I was thinking \\"I really SHOULD be eating some fruit and brown bread and potatoes\\" and everyone was telling me \\"it's just not good for you\\"....\\"everyone knows you NEED fruit and grains\\" and at the back of my mind I was thinking..\\"they're probably right\\" so I'd eat a litle bit of fruit and some brown bread and some potatoes.  Before long my jeans were getting tight around my belly and I just didn't feel as good as I did when I wasn't eating them.  So, I've read \\"Why We Get Fat\\" - three times so far....so I can now say to people that \\"No ! I don't actually NEED to eat fruit and if I have cream in my coffee it's not going to give me a heart attack and if I have eggs each morning for my breakfast...it won't raise my cholesterol\\".  I can now answer them when they say \\"well how come some people get fat and others don't?\\" and \\"well I've been on a calorie reducing diet and lost x amount of pounds\\".  Actually, funny thing, about 1988 I joined Weight Watchers and went from 12st 4lbs (172 lbs) to 9st 10lbs (136lbs) over the course of a few months.  But the WW plan was different then.  It was a units thing rather than a points thing.  You could have so many units of carbs/protein/fats etc.  I could only have 2 units of carbs a day (one slice of bread and 1 oz of cereal or 2 slices of bread) and it worked for me.  I joined WW years later and the points system was being used so you could eat what you want within a certain amount of points.  Didn't work.  I wasn't losing weight and I couldn't understand why and I was walking miles every day too.  Thing was, I know now, I was using too many carbs.<br /><br />The research has been done.  It has been proven.  It's not new....they've been saying this since the 1800's.<br />I understand how it has been a hard struggle to get people to believe this....I've had a hard struggle just in my home !!  But I'm sufficiently convinced from reading the book and from doing further research on the web, that this is the way to go.<br /><br />So now I'm back eating and cooking low carb.  Bolognese was always made from a packet for us until last night I made with all fresh ingredients the most delicious bolognese sauce and had Zucchini (or courgette as we call it where I come from !) strips as my \\"pasta\\" and you know what? I think I enjoyed it more than any other spaghetti bolognese dish I've had before.  I'm now scouring the web for recipes and my quest to convince my other half (or secretly switch him to low carb eating) has begun.  He's totally against it and thinks it's just a fad.  He has a driving job and carries a lot of weight around his belly and having read the book, I would worry that he will develop diabetes or worse so I'm going to cook the nicest recipes I can find knowing I'm cutting his carb count without him realising it.  I will go back to eating fruit and brown bread and potatoes (because I like them) when I've dropped the weight I want to drop but I won't eat them every dayor every second day.  I'm already eating vegetables that I haven't eaten before...and enjoying them.  I'm lucky in that I'm not obese...I don't have a huge amount of weight to lose but it's not all about weight.  I know my body is working the way it was meant to and while I can't do much about avoiding some of our modern day diseases or illnesses, I can do something about my blood pressure, cholesterol, state of my heart etc.<br /><br />So, yes, buy this book - read it from cover to cover.  It's an easy read - the language Gary Taubes uses in his book is easily understandable for people who are not in the medical world. See if it changes your way of thinking.  It has for me.  Stealing a line from one of our national newspapers \\"before you make up your mind - open it\\"or every second day.  I'm already eating vegetables that I haven't eaten before...and enjoying them.

B008DYZKQE|5.0|I liked this book when I was a kid, and even more so now! It's great for little girls its not your average princess story.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|sometimes it was a little difficult to keep track of all the characters but I liked the different perspectives and I look forward to #3

B000002MP2|5.0|There are no Green Day fans that don't mention Dookie as one of their favorites from such a wonderful band. The main power that Green Day has over other rock bands is simplicity and some traits of the post-rock classics like The Who, The Clash, and even The Beatles. This album is an amazing illustration of the modern punk-rock revolution that made this genre more mainstream, and allowed people to look at punk with more respect and attention. Some people here would say that the chords are way to simple, and the melodies of some songs are the rip-off from some older bands, but it's absolutely wrong since they were one of the first, or maybe the first ones, who opened a completely new road for punk, pop-punk. I suggest everyone to take a listen to this album without paying too much attention to the structure of the songs like most \\"music geeks\\" do.<br /><br />Indeed, a lot of catchy and careless melodies, and related to a real life add this album to one of the best albums of all time.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B008J1QFLU|5.0|I do not have a high-end system, but I can still hear the improvement in the sound over the 1997 release.  It's not a huge difference, but it is there.  This is such a high quality package, so hard to believe that such attention would be paid to a classical product, that it's almost embarrassing to note a few small details that Decca could have considered.<br />Most importantly, Acts 2 and 3 of Siegfried are well short of maximum CD length and that is just no reason whatsoever that they should have been split onto separate CDs.  So Act 1 would be on two short CDs; who would have cared?  Stupid.<br />Next, there is no track list except for each individual CD on the back of each CD envelope.  Not critical, but I enjoy the overview of a master track list.<br />Also, the books are in very small type.  Only for young eyes.<br />Last, I recall that the original LP Das Rheingold had a wonderful printed libretto: Next to the text was a column showing which leitmotiv was playing at that moment; you could get to know the leitmotivs like a pro with this tool.  It has never been repeated and should have been included with this libretto.<br />You can tell from the above list of minor complaints (only the Siegfried lay-out really matters) how impressive this Pride-Of-Ownership package is.  There is nothing else remotely like this in classical music merchandise.  If you have a low end system and only care about what you hear, you don't need this.  If you want better sound but don't need all the written and touchable materials, just wait a year or so and Decca will probably offer this new mastering in a package that will fit onto your existing CD shelves - which this LP-sized baby will not.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I HAVE READ ALL OF JOHN GRISHAM'S BOOKS AND WAIT EAGERLY FOR EACH NEW ONE.  THE \\"RACKETEER\\" IS A CHANGE FROM HIS NORMAL WRITING AND OFFERS A NEW PERSPECTIVE OF HIS BRILLIANT MIND. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PUT THIS BOOK ASIDE WHEN IT WAS TIME TO EAT OR SLEEP OR GO TO WORK.
1451695195|5.0|I am reading the book now and find it very compelling.  Dr Alexander is to be commended for sharing his experience with the public.    The author wishes to have his message believed in order to help people which is laudable.  Obviously it is impossible to check if the account is true to epistemic certainty; the credibility of the account lies in the credibility of the author.  I feel bad even asking some of these things but as stated above verifying the author is the only way to verify the account and the author has published a book stating his professional experience as the \\"proof of heaven\\"...    Yes, if anyone is wondering, Dr Alexander is a licensed neurosurgeon currently allowed to practice medicine in Mass.  Proof of this can be seen at this address:  [...]  Information on the web page seem to match academic experience details from the book.    Now, very few of us have led perfect lives (I haven't led a perfect personal or professional life), none of us are perfect and, as I mentioned above, all of the chronological facts that I have checked are verified by records.  Nevertheless, A brief explanation (or a link to an explanation) of the following items would be of immense personal help to me in being less skeptical as I read the book.    1.  The above web page at the bottom lists a hospital disciplinary action for \\"improper performance of surgery\\" at UMass memorial medical center which resulted in a suspension of privilege in 2003.    2.  Details of the medical board reprimand letter in 2010    3.  His biography states that he has a number (>100) of peer reviewed papers but a search of the pubmed site ([...]) only comes up with three results.  I just did a search of \\"Eben Alexander\\" on the main page.  It is possible I'm doing the search incorrectly but I did search my own name this way and found my own publications.    Dr Alexander, Thank you for sharing your experience.  You are under no obligation to answer the above and I totally understand if you do not want to.  But doing so would go a long way towards having people fully accept your message.    [[ASIN:1451695195 Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife]]
B009H441G4|5.0|The first time I head \\"Shatter the Empyrean\\" I knew Anaal Nathrakh was a diverse band.  Their scathing, climactic assault of riffs and vocals put Mick and Vitrol on a different level.  Both craft records that sound rigid and at times, harmonic.  \\"Vanitas\\" pushes their legacy forward by remaining close to their sound, yet infecting it with diversity.<br /><br />Only a few months after \\"Passion's\\" released, Vitrol announced that their forthcoming record, \\"Vanitas\\" was done.  Like most, I said, \\"That was fast.\\"  By no means does it feel rushed - A.N. only records when they are ready.  So what did the six months or so bring? Right off the bat, you will notice the organic nature of \\"Vanitas.\\"  Whatever didn't work was discarded in favor of \\"just vibing it out.\\"  There are bits of electronic elements sprinkled to push atmosphere.  The pace of the record is immaculate - mid-tempo intros are used early to build suspense (Todos Somos Humanos) which is only amplified by Vitols flawless cleans in \\"In Coelo Quies, Tout Finis Ici Bas.\\"  There are particular tracks that utilize a bit of \\"groove.\\"  I don't label A.N. as \\"such and such genre of band.\\"  A.N. is A.N.  \\"Vanitas\\" solidifies their sound while making experimental tweaks that pay off big time.<br /><br />Vitrol is insane.  I firmly believe \\"Vanitas\\" showcases his best work.  His cleans are bar-none, the best.  It's such a dichotomy.  He goes from guttural lows to piercing highs; to these elemental cleans(\\"To Spite the Face\\").  My personal favorite - \\"Forging Towards the Sunset\\" is just as anthemic as \\"Oil Upon the Sores of Lepers.\\"  The verses inevitably lead up to one of the best clean vocals sections I've ever heard.  Album closer \\"A Metaphor for the Dead\\" is compensated by the chugging of \\"Feeding the Beast,\\" and rapture of \\"Of Fire & ____ Pigs.\\"  It begins with haunting tones, then quickly dives into Mick's handy-work.  The song skirts closely to harmonic.  Vitrols cleans hit - you'd swear that they're unreal.  It's abeautiful choir of rhythm and tone. \\"A Metaphor for the Dead\\" closes the album off with resonance.<br /><br />Mick Kenney is by far one of the best guitarists in the business.  The riffs and sheer technicalities electrifying his digits are unmatched (\\"Make Glorious the Embrace of Saturn\\").  I proud \\"Vanitas\\" demonstrates sparse elements of groove.  Certain melodies are fresh and sit firmly in place next to their grinding riffs.  That's not to say A.N. have gone softer - just more experimental.  \\"Todos Somos Humanos\\" plunges audiences into fathoms known by fans.  Let's not forget the opener - \\"The Blood Dimmed Tide.\\"  After chilling spoken words; an onslaught - a barrage of grinding riffs similar to spear heads colliding with armor plating begins.<br /><br />Now I enlighten you all!  I am sure no one will make these connections but it is necessary.  I consider \\"Vanitas\\" to be a \\"fourth horsemen.\\"  Mick Kenney has had his hands into a bunch of projects this past year.  Where he goes - so do his influences.  Mick formed a band with Brandan Schiepatti called \\"Suffer Well.\\"  He described it as \\"Bleeding Through meets Anaal Nathrahk.\\"  You can tell by the way the album sounds, that it couldn't be more true.  Next - and most importantly, Bleeding Through's \\"The Great Fire\\" was produced by Mick.  That's why the album has DNA of A.N.  The guitar tuning, the grinds, the sharp blast beats, and shorter length.  The album plays off Bleeding Through's strength and religion to hardcore(review in my profile).  Next - I Am War's \\"Outlive You All\\" was also produced by Mick.  Listen to the riffs and tuning - it has residues of Mick's own hand - rigid and scathing.  Now we have \\"Vanitas\\" - the fourth member of this chronology.  Within the past year Mick has been in the shadows helping other bands only for him to come full circle.  Knowing this makes the record more enjoyable.  You will notice certain elements that - \\"Hey, that sounds like that one part from...\\"  Not that any of the records are cut and paste, but each has some residue of another.  \\"Vanitas\\" is the crescendo.  All hail the \\"Serpent's Breath.\\"
B0083JCCX8|3.0|Good book. Could go a bit deeper and darker but over 3.5/5 will be reading the over two in the series. If you liked the film you'll enjoy this book
B001F0WXY0|4.0|Great book by a very good writer.  The story and characters immediately grabbed hold of me and it was hard to put it down.  Very good imagery, characterization and plot.<br /><br /> Couldn't give it 5 stars because I'm still looking for something to equal A Song of Ice and Fire by GRRM.  Dune IMO is the closest I've found so far!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This works great on my Kindle Fire HD. Its pretty accurate, looks great, and gives a lot of detailed information.
B008OOYALE|3.0|A mellow game that doesn't require much strategy or thought, but it's fun to see what your dragons will turn into. Breeding dragons adds an element of surprise. Glad that goals have been included from the start.  Works great on Kindle Fire.<br /><br />** Downgrading my review because the imbalance between what's offered for Apple store version versus Kindle Fire just keeps growing.  Too many things to list, but will go back to 5 stars if the KF version ever gets fully upgraded.
034580404X|5.0|This book is amazing!! The story is great and I love the characters. It's really a book that ladies MUST read. I 100% recommend it!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Like several of the other reviewers i will state i am not in the target audience for Taylor Swift.  I am an older african american neo-soul and R&B music lover.  However none of this matters when you, regardless of profile, come across fantastic music.<br /><br />Taylor has done the near impossible with Red.  Every one of her CDs grows better and better - every cut.  I have had her last CD Speak Now cemented in my car's 6 disc player as CD 1 since it came out.  It is still there years later as every other CD rotated out for newer tunes or to fit what ever mood i happened to be in.  Never mattered with Speak Now, it survived and continues.<br /><br />Red has instantly become a fixture in slot number 2.  I've listened to it end to end over three dozen times in the first week it came out.  And here is what is so amazing about this talented disc, you will have a challenge deciding which is your favorite.<br /><br />With sixteen tracks (more if you buy the bonus edition at Target) Taylor once again displays song writing and vocal skills which defy her age.  Not since Billy Joel have i experienced such a talent to paint pictures, create complete stories through song.<br /><br />Also, with this disc Taylor's journey continues as she delivers country, pop, dance and even some adult contemporary tunes.  The dance tunes will, of course, power the disc on the charts, \\"We are never getting back together\\" already has and \\"22\\" will soon follow.<br /><br />However, her sweet tunes which are both catchy and deep at the same time provide a depth which is missing from most of today's artists.  \\"All too Well\\", \\"Everything has changed (my current favorite)\\" and \\"Begin Again\\" all speak to this skill.<br /><br />However, the irresistible \\"Stay Stay Stay\\" i believe will solidify her spot as a country darling while providing the cross over appeal that designates her as a superstar with lasting powers.<br /><br />Overall Red receives my highest mark because there is not a bad song on the disc.  Each time i play it i discover something different about it and leave amazed.  With Red the competition for Album of the year is over.  Congrats Taylor.  If you haven't picked it up yet, download it today.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Reminds me too much of the evils of small town politics among adults combined with belligerant teenagers. Nothing good or happy ever happens to these people.  A miserable lot.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I like a story line, not just sex, sex, and weird humilating sex. I thought these books were degrading to women. How is it remotely believable that an innocent virgin is accepting of this kind of sexual behavior? Maybe there are women who want to be treated like human garbage, but I choose to believe that most women want romance, love, and human compassion in a relationship. Unless the characters in these books were under some kind of spell, I don't believe this kind of relationship is possible between two normal people. Maybe I should have said with one of the people being normal... I think that the women who are standing in lines, and acting a little nuts over these books, have discovered a kind of pornography that is acceptable to the general public. I don't think the general public realizes just how degrading these books are to women. I was under the impression they were a little kinky, but overall a romance novel. I plan on deleting these books from my Kindle, because I would be so embarrassed if one of my family members discoved that I read these books.
1451638450|2.0|If you haven't read any other books in the Vorkosigan Saga, don't start here.  And if you have, don't expect this to live up to the the earlier novels.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this, having been a fan of the author since first reading the first book in the series when it first came out.  The first book, Shards of Honor, is one of my absolute favorite books, a perfect blend of sci-fi/thriller/romance filled with insightful social commentary, with intelligent, memorable characters whose flaws and strengths make for a riveting read.<br /><br />Comic supporting character the risk-averse \\"that idiot\\" Ivan is neck deep in intrigue and romance, mostly of his own making. The characterizations and diluted, contrived plot falls under the weight of the earlier stories (an irony if there ever was one).  It feels as if the author was compelled to deliver a new addition to the Vorkosigan Saga, versus a story she deeply wanted to tell.<br /><br />Like many fans of the series, I usually can't wait til the next book. So much so that I pre-ordered this the moment it was available on Amazon even after the disappointed previous book in the series.  But now I'm convinced as much as I love the characters in the Vorkosigan saga, it's time to retire them.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It said the new version would come out October 15.Its almost November 15.0.4.0 is so dang boring.Update please.Don't get till 0.4.0 passes.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of Grisham.  He is one of the few authors whom I preorder his novels sight unseen.  He has rarely disappointed and oftentimes exceeds my high expectations.<br /><br />With the Racketeer, at least for me, he misses the mark.  Please read carefully as my critic is mostly tied up with one pet peeve of mine and may not be a show stopper for other readers.<br /><br />Grisham delivers his usual page turning suspense, interesting scenarios which move with the usual fluid speed of the genre.  He also creates a believable set of characters who are both familiar while being unique at the same time.  The plot set-up also is a stroke of genius.  It will definitely keep you guessing as how it will play out especially about half way through the novel when you realize the story is not going in the direction you had been led to believe.<br /><br />And this what destroyed the story for me.  I don't mind being mislead, surprised or being outsmarted (happens often).  My issue is these are not the things i expect from my main character.  Grisham uses the unreliable narrator as his main character - though this is a valid point of view, it is a troublesome selection in a mystery, especially one structured like this.  It also happens to be my least favorite narration form.<br /><br />Essentially, by utilizing the unreliable narrator everything you are led to be believe in the first half of the book is either untrue or suspect.  This may be a nice surprise for some readers for a mystery reader this is very unsettling especially because such a skilled novelist as Grisham he has displayed time and time again the ability to surprise, create plot twists and deliver the unexpected without resorting to an unreliable narrator.<br /><br />End of the day, the Racketeer is a page turner - i finished it in two days - however, at least for me, i've come to expect better from Grisham.  (note:  i will still preorder his next legal thriller - still a fan).
B008SVFX96|2.0|I've always thought that the best of Bon Jovi was Richie Sambora as he show us in his two previous jobs. But on this album I see the worst of the songs of  Bon Jovi's last albums.On the other hand, the sound of this CD is very noisy, like the style of some albums of the 70's . In short, and for not doing more blood, this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have a samsung galaxy note 10.1&quot; and it come preloaded with Polaris Office, which looks pretty but shuts down when working on large files and is a pain to format word files that are more than just words.<br /><br />So i decided to check out office Suite Pro on the samsung Note it is amazing. I can easily  locate and edit files without worry of losing precious work to unexpected shut down of the app. Sending files via the app to friends, family and coworkers through a linked email address is great as well. Do yourself a favor, purchase the app.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I love me some Muse and The 2nd Law is their best work yet!  Unmistakeably Muse, each song brings a different feel and musical texture.  Pulsing beats in Madness with that out of control touchpad bass to the drive in Liquid State this album keeps you engaged and excited.  Great, great stuff!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|The pure simplicity of it allows for greater imagination. It allows you the opportunity to look at gorgeous, intriguing art and get into the heads of your competitors.

B0063B2BNE|4.0|I should preface this review by saying that I can never get enough Bones, which may make my perspective a bit skewed.  I am certainly more Booth than Brennan.  Season 7 lacks some of the heat and heart that was season 6.  Season 6 was a tough act to follow: it opened with the joyful reunion of the Jeffersonian crew, the disappointment of Booth coupling up with Hannah, the ache when Brennan realizes that she \\"lost her moment\\" with Booth, the horror of death of the brilliant Mr. Nigel-Murray, the delight of the birth of Micheal Staccato Vincent, and that amazing look on Booth's face in the final scene.  How could you possibly follow that up?<br /><br />Well lets start with the pay off of finally seeing the best will-they-won't they couple since Ross and Rachel finally together, the so cheesy it works birth of Baby Booth, and not to mention the creepiest bad guy since Gormogon.  The individual episodes are still filled with the typical Bones recipe of intrigue, science, relationships, and humor.  Plus we still see all of the wonderfully cooky and diverse characters we have grown to love from Daisy all the way to Hodgins.  And luckily, Booth and Brennan haven't lost any of the chemistry and friction as a fully realized couple.  So, while season 7 lacked the punch of some of the other seasons, it still entertains and lays ground work for a dynamite season 8.  Overall, this Jeffersonian Junkie is queued up!
B006TVQU6C|5.0|This case came in without any extra boxes to ship it with. It came with its own box but, everything was still intact and as for the case. I love it, it's stealthy and can fit a full atx and a full size video card.
0345803485|5.0|My opnion of Fifty Shades of Grey is very different from the reviews I have read here. I have been a happliy married woman for over 30 years. I love BDSM and I love a terrific love story. This was a very entertaining blend of BDSM & a women's perfect love story. I have read some who critize Anatasia b/c she submits to his will, well sort of. I loved it!!!!. He is so totally into her. Everyone woman would love a man that into them. He worships her and she worships him. I was left wanting more. It was not as kinky as I would have liked but I think the story was very intertaining.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|great time killer.  good tip.  do not sell the prize back.<br />it is a slow start but things move faster after you get four of each prize. good game for free. I wouldn't pay for it.  coins can be purchased but they are not cheap.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a perfect finale for such an amazing story. The author has a way of telling things that don't need to explain everything. She don't subestimate the reader. I love that!! The characters are so real, you can identify yourself or any of your friends with them. Recommended!

0765326353|5.0|I really don't know where to start, I loved this novel so much that I even love reading the reviews.  Anyone else?  The hardcover edition of this novel is art, simply put, and the content of this novel is epic, a classic is really all you can say.  This will be the fantasy novel we look back on as the one.  I promise, buy this book in any form and read it.  Did I mention that I wasn't even a fantasy fan, until now, now I am hooked.  If people are giving this novel bad reviews, it is because it is too complex for them, honestly.  This novel begs for your attention, and deservingly so, because a lot of heart and soul was put into this book, you can just tell.  Sometimes you just know when you are reading something amazing, something that will go down in history as great, and a classic.  My jaw is on the floor, do yourself and your imagination a favor and open this book, and share it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written. Eben's experience gives me hope that here may be an afterlife. His discussions with peers about his experience after he came \\"back\\" lent credence to his journey's authenticity. I had a very emotional moment when he came back to this world. I remember saying out loud \\"life is precious\\". I am personally experiencing very difficult times and suicide has been on my mind from time to time. This book has helped me realize how precious my life on earth is. I'll need to read this book again.

0525958002|5.0|I have been a fab five fan since the RIO album when I first heard Hungry Like The Wolf on the radio in my cousins' home in 1984. Duran Duran have remained my favorite band for nearly thirty years, so I was excited to read this book written by the man who first inspired me to play bass guitar, or music at all for that matter. It was an eye-opener; a glimpse into the very heart and soul of the band itself, chiefly John of course. I was very pleased with it and could hardly put it down before I finished it. Very nice!
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Amazing movie about the inner strength and motivation Aron Ralston possessed when trapped by a giant rock. His will to live surpasses everything else.

1432794426|5.0|For someone on the fence about Michael Jackson this book is written for you. The explanation of some of his activities from a psychological point of view is enlightening. You will see a side of MJ you never really thought of until you have read the book[[ASIN:0974535400 Baby Richard: A Four-Year-Old Comes Home]]. She has also written \\"Baby Richard: A Four Year Old Comes Home\\" which is a behind the scene story of a controversial adoption & reversal. Again a vindication for the people that have been persecuted by the press.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have seen tr movie and have read the book...so I have an idea of the different scenes that the author was trying to describe to the reader. The book went into great detail about the different locations that the character encountered! I enjoyed the book very much! I think that the book is appropriate for readers who are not in there teens. It can be hard to read about children killing children at times. However, the book allowed you to travel to a far away place.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Some Nights by FUN is a super, up beat cd.  Love the words and the music!  Have told others about it.

B001UW58YK|5.0|I'm not really a fan of this guy, this was a gift for my girlfriend but I did enjoy the show when I watched it with her. He's a real ham taking every opportunity to have one sided banter with the audience and to me it comes across as a little phony but he can sing and I liked a lot of the songs he sang also. Enjoyable and the audio and video quality are as good as you should expect for a concert on blu-ray.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this is amazing I love it so much the graphics are amazing the gameplay is amazing the best game ever!!!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie was good, as were the graphics. The plot was definitely different than what the previews lead viewers to expect. I would not classify this as a horror movie or that much of a thriller, but it was interesting. If you're expecting something amazing based on the previews, you'll be sorely disappointed.
0545425115|5.0|I just finished reading this series in a weekend.  I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I definitely recommend this series.  I was originally avoiding since it was so popular with the tweens.  I definitely recommend.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again Grisham has done it again.  Loved the background of the prison system, judical system.  Intriging to the final page.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|This movie and its predecessor Shawn of the dead, are witty, clever, and rip roaring hilarious movies. However one complaint with this movie is that the death and actions scenes can get a bit gory/messy (but if you like that kind of action then it doesn't matter then). The humor itself is great overall and can sometimes be really dry (but that is British humor for you). A great movie in short!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|was so chuffed when my mum bought me this book for my birthday, I could'nt stop reading it for days

B008S80OU2|4.0|I received my box set from amazon today.  Only four stars because the download site is not working.  I have tried most of this evening and it isn't accessible.  The set is great, of course, but Sony needs to get their act together.
B000002GIE|5.0|i am very impressed by the fast delivery and high quality of the product i ordered.I say,  keep up the great work!!
B00008EY9G|5.0|Identity is one of those movies with a plot so intriguing that the twist catches you by surprise. It's a scary movie, but nothing gruesome or gross. John Cusack is great, and every character is as mysterious as you'd expect. One of my favorites that I have now added to my collection of DVDs. The shipping was fast, the DVD works great.
1595141715|5.0|very good book loved it. It was about this girl and she left 13 reasons why she killed herself. can't wait to see the movie coming in 2013

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Wonderful read!  Jodi Picoult never fails me.  She has a talent for writing about controversial subjects and makeing the reader take the time to understand both sides.  The families in this book feel very real, although established financially and professionally, they easily fit into your imagination as believable and honest.  This book will make you want to sit down with your teens and TALK TALK TALK!

B007EZJKS2|5.0|This was always one of my favorite movies as a kid, and I was excited when I saw that it was available as a graphic novel for my Kindle.  The story is strong and, although a bit mature for some kids, I think that it's a great read for both the young and old.  The main thing that pulled me into purchasing this was the visuals in the sample.  If you love graphic novels for their match of strong graphics and a strong story, then this won't let you down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this series; every person should give it a chance. It will change your sex life forever! Men and women - BUY IT!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is really fun because there's more than one game it might be challenging but its free and fun.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I absolutely could not put the book down and hated for it to end. What an incredible American.  He has been wrongly labeled by the press and our government as having \\"outed\\" his fellow SEALS.  Glad  I could hear the truth of the mission - not some typical government cover up that was packed with lies and deceit. If you are truly American and believe in our country and the principles it was founded on, please read this book.  please note that our government has denied the acceptance of any proceeds from the sales of this book to help families of the SEALS and SEALS themselves who have been killed or injured in pursuit of keeping us safe!
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|It has been a long time since I have seen a movie this bad.  I thought it would be campy and funny because it was so cheesy- no it was just bad writing and bad acting with a bad plot.  Steer clear of this steaming pile.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it fun but can be a lot of work at times.  good way to past time<br />you have to use Investment points a lot and they aren't that easy to get with out pay cash
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like the way this app works -- it's easier using this than pinning on the website for sure! :)
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was truly captivating!  I never once put the book down until I finished it a few hours after I started it.  I'm almost 30 now but the way this book is written dropped me right back in the middle of high school drama.  I can relate to Hannah, the girl who commits suicide, in so many ways; it's amazing how things people do in high school can stick with you through your school years and, then, even beyond.  This book should be read by all because it has an amazing story to tell, as well as some very important life lessons that we should all remember.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were great!  I couldn't put them down until I was done with the third book.  I cant wait to read them again.  Highly recommended.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is so fun my sis got it for me on my kindle fire witch is awesome I got the game a culled days ago and I had to try it out so I did and it was really fun for me and my sis
B008VBYN80|4.0|decent but set for constant purchase of resources versus paying up front.  would prefer light model to try and then pay for full version.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hugh Howey writes a fascinating tale worthy of any New York Times best seller list. If your looking for a great dystopian story this is- it! Highly recommended!
B005LAII8K|5.0|This film really attacks that conundrum of time travel. It just captivates you with the different possibilities of how going back in time can lead characters into a million alternatives. I LOVED IT!<br />Plus Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance was amazing. He took aspects of his character from mannerisms to gestures to another level. It was not an imitation of Willis but something mopre profound. You could believe that Levitt's character would grow up to be Bruce Willis's character that he was the same character. Even his smile left me with wide eyes because that was spot on Willis.<br />I loved how this story tackled being at odds with yourself, being your own worst enemy and so forth. It's a film that has action and leaves you thinking. I totally recommend and will definitely have it in my film collection for years to come.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Have followed John Grisham from the beginning, and once again he does not disappoint. We all have our favorites of course, but I would recommend this book with all of his others.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Making Mirrors is a great album. Several of the songs have Youtube videos to go with the music. Very worthwhile purchase and addition to my music library!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This movie really holds the essence of the 80's. And the magic of the sunset strip and rock n roll. And the cheesyness of the 80's. This one will get stuck in your head. And Tom Cruise was actually cool in this movie.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Just love that fact /I can watch Tv on my kindle fire. Very clear picture. The show is fantastic. My Dvd did not record. I do not like paying but I was worth it.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I loved it. It was a cute, original storyline. The characters were well-drawn, high quality animation, a blend of folklore and modern values. The princess was a brat, her brothers darling. I don't want to say too much and give the story away, but the ending had me in sentimental tears (just like most Pixar movies do.) This is child-friendly, yet not childish. The movie got better and better as it evolved. I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD and so glad I finally got to see it!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I started with the free version of this game and ended up getting all of the Dr. Panda apps for my Kindle. My 3 year old grandson is always wanting to play video games that he is way too young for and these games have certainly helped with that.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I have to say I approched the film skeptical thinking it would be cheezy and stupid. Not at all. Great movie. Great action. Great story. Great direction. Great eery dark music. Makes Abe look like a badass. Great theme!! I don't usually remember quotes from movies but this one stuck in my head. \\" Power doesn't come from hate, but from truth\\"<br /><br />there are twist and turns all throughout the movie. I love that type of story line where the audience is guessing what happens next. not many movies stick in my head after viewing, but this one did. im probably going to watching again perhaps buy it.<br /><br />I read some review slandering the movie saying its not historically acurate blah blah. quit being negative and read the title haha. those type of people have nothing better to do but complain about everything and are miserable. now if you like movies. i recommend this film to you.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Since everyone has already rated this, I thought I'd give a few suggestions<br /><br />Operation:<br />First of all, to operate it is pretty simple, put your headphones in the \\"output\\" jack, and your source in the \\"input\\". Turn it on! I personally think the effects can be heard a little louder, if you turn down the sound on your playing device (computer, ipod...etc) and turn up the volume on the Amp. You can mess with the EQ by sliding the bar on the right (up) for just a second or less.<br /><br />EQ setting suggestions:<br />Obviously, this depends on the song and genre, but here are some basics<br /><br />Red (bass boost): This one is my second favorite (behind blue). However, if you like loud music, I believe this is the best one for you. Because the highs are not overly loud, and the mids aren't crazy crisp, you can turn this up very very loud without it ever getting \\"tinny\\" or screeching in your ear.<br /><br />Blue (Mids boost): I think this one works best for most songs. It depends on your headphones, but my ATH M50's (Audio Technica) already have a good amount of bass and mids. However, this mids boost really lets you hear a lot of things you didn't notice before, and i think it results in the most clean, full sound of all the EQ's.<br /><br />Pink (energy saver or somethin): Idk what this does. All I really notice it doing is slightyy turn down the volume. I assume it's to save battery, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />No light (standard): Just a good old standard volume/crisp boost.<br /><br />Hope that helps!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My favorite of the trilogy!! A must read for any woman, will spark the heat back into life!!!  Could not put it down
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Frankly, this album is a pretty bad one considering the rest of Aerosmith's catalog. There are a few good songs. It feels like there are two Aerosmith's here: Steven Tyler's ballad crooning, sappy, less-guitar-more-strings approach and Aerosmith the hard rock band with Steven Tyler who tries to make the songs sound like his version of Aerosmith. The ballads here do not sound heartfelt like many of the 90's ones or are just poor songwriting. The ballads don't even hardly have guitars--and definately no soaring solos. The other songs have a groove to them but largely are devoid of real choruses or hooks that made Aerosmith's hard yet catchy approach work in the past. Worst of all is the amount of backing vocals Steven Tyler puts down. Sounds like a Beatles or worse a bad Beach Boys Ala Steven Tyler. The raw sound just ain't there. To make matter's worse the Mastering job is poor. Compressed to death it's really hard to hear what's going on or enjoy the sound because the amount of it attempts to beat the listener into submission.  I wish I could report otherwise...shame.

B002QW7AJY|4.0|Amazing movie visually and excellent directing, cinematography and set design \\"but\\" the main guy played by Ben Foster is a bit over the top along with another young actor who creeps up halfway through the film. Besides that its a totally cool sci-fi movie with great bad guys and story. really good special effects. The mass of that spaceship is amazing. Looking forward to more science fiction from this director. Actually i would nominate this director for the next Star Wars film
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love this Movie.  When I first saw it in the theater I remember thinking \\" oh no\\" when the singing started on the bus but as it went on I fell in love with the characters and all the humor.  The singing talent is extraordinary.  It gets high marks for good, fun entertainment!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series of books.  What a great read for me.  Eager to find out what happens next, all three books were a page turner for me.<br />I can see why JK Rowlings was upset with this author, EL James, for James is a much better writer than Rowlings could ever hope to be.<br />If you are like me, and like to read a good book, then these books would be right up your alley.
0345803485|1.0|The book doesn't flow at all. There was no connection with the characters. One minute she's getting ready for a date and the next she is in the hardware store working and the next she's in a car driving, all in the same paragraph. Did an Editor see this book before it came out? How did this get so popular? Got as far as chapter 8.

B002L9N4EM|1.0|Just bought this as a gift for a friend.  Maybe somewhere in the product description it should tell that it is not an actual box of chocolates, but rather a scratch and sniff card.  How dumb is that?  I thought I was sending a thoughtful gift and instead just looked stupid for thinking they were real.  No where in the description does it say anything about the chocolates, and the title definitely leads a person to believe that they are actual chocolates.  I paid twice as much thinking chocolates would be a nice addition for a gift. No such luck.  Extremely disappointed with this order.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Having read a lot of John Grisham books, I never know how they will truly end. This book is another one where you don't know exactly how it would end, but bits and pieces come together and make it a good read. As I read it I wondered how it would be on the big screen. More Grisham books need to be made into movies.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was just looking for a simple weather forecasting application, and came across this app. I am totally blown away! It is surprisingly in depth with a ton of info - including wind direction and speed, and an hourly representation! There are extended forecasts, and everything is extremely detailed. I am thus far incredibly impressed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read!! I read the first one Bared to You after I read the 50 shades of grey books!! Def. Just as good if not better reads!! LOVE THEM! I cant wait until book 3 comes out!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I have never written a book review before but I just had to for this book.  Bought the book based on the name of the author.  Wish I hadn't especially at full price.  WAY too many characters to keep track of that were all flat and boring.  Save your money and borrow it from the library.  I'm sure there won't be a long wait list to get the book.
0060935464|5.0|My son's 9th-grade class was assigned \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" in their English course. It has been over twenty years since I had read Harper Lee's classic and only novel. The small, Alabama town of Maycomb is in the grips of the Great Depression. Jim Crow is alive and well doing its worse by oppressing African-Americans. The story is seen through the eyes of tomboy Scout Finch. It highlights her growth from a six-to-nine-year-old girl. Ms. Lee created a protagonist who still had a child's innocence about the world around her. She isn't just confused about the illogical nature of prejudice but also by many of the social norms of small town America. Scout's dad, the now iconic Atticus Finch, is a poor, 50ish, intelligent lawyer of reason and high morals struggling to raise his daughter and their 13-year-old son Jem. He fortunately has the help of an intelligent black maid named Calpurnia. The climax of the story finds Atticus defending Tom Robinson, an African-American accused of assaulting a white woman.<br /><br />Ms. Lee, who was born in Alabama, clearly expresses her disdain for many of the South's cultural mores. The story not only shows the actual manner in which blacks were treated, but ridicules the Southern obsession with family lineage and how your place in society is based purely on which hoo hoo you popped out of during birth. The story has some wonderfully colorful and highly believable characters. It harkens back to a tougher, simpler time and how most of these folks tried to live god-fearing, decent lives, but don't have the intelligence or courage to treat blacks as human beings; let alone equals. The N-word is appropriately used quite frequently in the book due to the nature of the times and location of the novel.<br /><br />Ms. Lee's book is a well-written story that deserves its wide readership. It is also still very relevant in 2012. It would've been inconceivable to 1930 Southerners that less than eighty years later an African-American would be elected President of the United States. The reelection of President Obama just occurred two days ago and some of the very vulgar stereotypes expressed about him (especially on such mediums as Twitter) shows racism is still very much alive and well throughout America. Prejudice manifests itself in many ways. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"  humanizes the destructive nature that prejudice causes to the victims, perpetrators and bystanders. A great, sometimes funny, suspenseful work of art that challenges readers to look at themselves in the mirror.ected President of the United States.

B000HAB4KS|5.0|Matrix is an amazing movie, but not just for the entertainment value.  There are many deep truths buried in this movie's metaphorical presentation, if one is willing to open their minds.  Obviously, there is plenty of hollywood rendition and some false concepts in it, but I would recommend this movie to anyone, religious or not.  This comes from someone who does not watch TV, aside from an occasional sports contest or news, and who hasn't watched a movie in almost a decade.  A trusted associate recommended I check this movie out.  No regrets here.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I told myself I was not going to review the rest of the trilogy because there wasn't much left to say. I've had a change of heart after getting into a ridiculous argument with someone (who hasn't read the books), who told me that just because I felt FSoG was bad, didn't mean it was badly written, and that a best-seller with 5 stars reviews must be a good book.<br /><br />My subconcious stood up from her deck chair and hurled the complete works of Dan Brown at their head, just to prove them wrong. Best-sellers indeed! Then my inner goddess pulled a Macbook Pro out of her satchel and wrote this review:<br /><br />The problem with Fifty Shades is not the victim blaming, child abuse, sexual abuse, BDSM-lite, or unhealthy relationships. It's not the poor quality of the writing, ridiculous prose, technical errors, or the tedious amount of repetition. The problem is that neither the plot nor the characters are very interesting, nobody is likeable or believeable. They do not grow in any meaningful way, aside from Christian growing 8 inches every 4 pages or so.<br /><br />What are Ana's goals?  What does she actually want, or do, that does not revolve around Christian?  What obstacles does she actually overcome? She faced no challenges prior to graduating, and she easily landed a job. She has no wants, no desires, no plans for herself, and that makes for very boring reading. Whenever something unpleasant pops up, Ana tells Christian, and he scares it off, or solves it with his wallet. Ana does not advance as a person.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Look at her interactions with the secondary characters. Why does Kate have so much power over Ana? Aside from snapping at Kate a few times, Ana cringes and debases herself, and gives Kate her way.  If anyone needs a good spanking it's Kate for being so pushy. Ana never has to find a way to handle working with Jack, a real person would either learn to deal with his advances, or quit and suffer the financial consequences of unemployment. Christian just fires him. Why doesn't Ana just tell Mrs. Robinson to go pound sand if she hates her so much? Instead, each time Mrs R contacts her, Ana alerts Christian so he can deal with it. The Leila plot failed to introduce any tension into the story.<br /><br />Christian's issues are equally stupid. I can accept he was emotionally scarred by his early trauma and was a self-destructive person until he learned how to let go in the arms of Mrs. Robinson.  It's not his background that's the problem, it's his ridiculous way of viewing life: \\"The scary world might harm Ana so I MUST KEEP HER SAFE.\\"<br /><br />Ana might die in a car crash so he won't let her drive. She might drown so he straps her into a life jacket. She might starve to death so he nags her to eat. She might pull a muscle from their bedroom gymnastics so he gets her a personal trainer. She is a doormat, so he fires people who give her grief. Yet for all his problem solving, Christian  never learns that some problems cannot be solved with money, you need to communicate, and let people grow so they can handle life. He's the parent who wants to Ana-proof the world. Christian never learns to compromise. He never stops imposing his will on others by interfering in their lives financially. Who would actually put up with that?<br /><br />Christian overcomes his biggest obstacle through deus ex machina and we're expecting to believe that he no longer needs to dominate women, and he will happily live a life with Ana, feeling emotionally and sexually fulfilled, without imposing the type of pain that gets him off? There is no sense that Ana is interested in Christian as a person. What do either of them really want or do, aside from having lots of sex? The sexual content is not that wild or good either. This series is the sum of all crap, or \\"triple crap\\" as Ana would say.<br /><br />(For a truly hot pain-filled angsty romp try Claudia D. Christian)consequences of unemployment.

I created an occurrence,  there was no communication and when I checked the status,  The occurrence was closed,  listed as resolved and no one will respond.

Although there are numerous youtube videos, blogs, advice, and new websites available specifically for programming, use, installation, start-up, accessories, and many other innovating information, the user guide provides the necessities for any user. Weather on the road, airport, bus, library, or anywhere a good book can be read, you can fill-up about Raspberry Pi, especially if the internet is not available. Either way, it is great to have on hand.

0316067598|5.0|I could not put this book down and have told everyone I know to buy and read it. It not only gives you the background of this brave and humble hero, but leads us through the rigors of Navy Seal training, the camraderie and team spirit of the Seals, and then leads you through his harrowing adventure. You will come to realize just why Seal training is as arduous as it is and why they never leave a fallen comrade!  Marcus also pays tribute to his family and we learn they went through waiting for a rescue or a body. The reviewers who criticize this book as written by a conservative or war monger missed the entire point of this book. As for readers who say Marcus has an attitude and is pompous have no clue what kind of person it takes to be not only a Navy Seal but anyone in the military.  I want to personally thank Marcus and pay respect to his lost comrades for their sacrifices they make and made so we can enjoy the freedoms too many people take for granted. Every young adult should read this book and maybe they will gain a better appreciation for our military - past and present.  Thank you to all our Veterans this coming Veteran's Day!  You are my heroes!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The main reasons for this are:<br />1) Explains many myths that I didn't know. For example, overload causes muscle growth and not fatigue. In other words, there is no point in doing 30 reps with lightweights.<br />2) He gives a lot of scientific explanation. However, he doesn't always give proof of this, but it does make sense. You learn how your body works and not only what to do.<br />3) Gives you detailed workout plans and diets for both bulking and cutting.<br />4) Tells you the truth about it, and tells you the truth about supplements.<br />4) THIS IS THE BIG ONE. He is present on forums like bodybuilding and you can contact him through his e-mail account, with any questions and he answers right back. Just yesterday night I sent him 8 questions, and they were all answered by the morning of the next day. I've seen people show him their full diet plan, which is simply great. AND FREE. I've tried Tom Venuto's book, which was good, but was filled with a load of BS nobody wants to hear. This is pretty straightforward. Moreover, Venuto didn't have that follow up for free.<br /><br />I would have given it a 4 if it weren't for the fact you can talk to him anytime. Totally worth the price.
B00003OO3O|5.0|UFO is a Blues based hard rock band from Britain formed back in 1969 by Phil Mogg, Andy Parker, and Pete Way. Michael Schenker joined the band in 1973 and so began a six year stint of fabulous creative music and the release of five studio albums and one live double package.<br /><br />At the core of the band is Michael Schenker on lead guitar. Phil Mogg on vocals, Pete Way on Bass, and Andy Parker on drums.<br /><br />Force It was released in 1975. It has an aggressive driving guitar sound full of blistering riffs. \\"Force It\\" spawned 5 major concert favorites, Let It Roll, Shoot Shoot, Out In The Street, Mother Mary, and This Kid's. All of them showing up later on the band's signature live album, Strangers In The Night.\\"<br /><br />Their music was very much underrated for the time period. They had one of the strongest guitarists on the move at the time and the album \\"Force It\\" was their first march into rock stardom from their earlier bluesy offerings. It also helped them penetrate the foreign markets and earn them acclaim at home which seemed reserved for bands like Led Zeppelin at the time.<br /><br />There isn't one bad tune in the bunch. Mogg is an excellent vocalist providing excellent melodies to complement Schenker's endless six string arsenal.<br /><br />UFO are one of heavy metal's earliest and greatest bands and this release is the beginning of their best creative period. UFO would gain huge success over the years and this album in my opinion started it all.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|My advice to you is this. Do not listen to this album looking for those Dream On's, Crying's, Living on the Edge's or Sweet Emotions...or whatever your favorite songs are. Listen to MFAD for what it is, and you'll discover all new favorites that are bound to become synonymous with Aerosmith.<br /><br />With that said...This album is so much fun to listen to, and has so much to offer.<br /><br />There are truly fantastic rockin' out songs such as Luv XXX, Beautiful, Legendary Child and Street Jesus. These songs have all that Aerosmith sass, quirkiness, funk and the killer beats you've come to love. And wow, what a great way to set the tone of this album with Luv XXX.<br /><br />Then there are amazing ballads such as Another Last Goodbye. Another Last Goodbye is raw, emotional, moving and deeply powerful - this song sends goosebumps down my entire body as I feel emotions long forgotten well up from within. Tyler's voice rips raw with emotion that's impossible not to lose yourself in. This song is purely fantastic, and without question my favorite ballad on the album - Yes, I love Aerosmith ballads.<br /><br />The collaboration with Carrie Underwood is also a great joy to listen to, and a really nice treat to have on this album. I'm sure the radio stations will eat this one up.<br /><br />From the sexually fueled rock songs to the ballads and all the funkiness, quirkiness and sassiness in between, this album has been worth the 11 year wait! Simply sampling the songs doesn't do each justice. The entire album is worth the purchase.

0312427573|5.0|A must read, and a must re-read.  TW at his very best.  After re-reading it, I am puttin git on my Christmas list for some unsuspecting neices and nephews who have likely not read it.
1451695195|5.0|Bought this book for my husband. Same quality I had seen at the Major Book Stores , however at half the cost. I recommend this book for great reading.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Works fine but need to fix the glitch where statuses only post on second time. They remember them in the status box now but NEVER post on first submit
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I could get stuck on here for hours reading... Which could be good or bad... But I love this app!!
B0081SRJSY|2.0|AI does not mimic rationale human opponents. User interface is lacking. Only includes one expansion. Still I love to play even if imperfect.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see what happens next. I need a Gideon Cross! May is so far away!
B008KE3960|4.0|This is a unique fun game.  Unlike other tower games this one is always different.  You cannot beat the price.  You will not be sorry you downloaded Air Patriots.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Very well written but a dark theme. Glad my life is better. A definite read. It kept you drawn in and you didn't want to put it down until the end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put these books down & read the series over a weekend. Really opens your eyes to a lifestyle many would look down upon but by the end, I think many have a new respect for the lifestyle that one is inclined to choose if it works for them! Great series but I'm a little sad that I've read them all & it's now over! :(
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not put this book down. I figured the book would end the way it did, however I didn't expect any of the twists and turns Grisham took to get there. Grisham has such a creative mind.
B009NCM248|5.0|Best Stone Sour album ever! Very good lyrics and the music is amazing.  Love everything about Stone Sour's new album.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great read with a big switch in the middle. Nobody would guess the end and it is probably an improbable situation in reality that reads as real.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good storytelling. Enjoyed it very much.  Look forward to further episodes. Get the Omnibus from the start to save money.
0385738773|4.0|*4 1/2 stars*<br /><br />Well, I really liked this series. A lot. The last book was just as suspenseful as the other two. I loved the short chapters, yet was amazed how every one still felt like a mini-cliffhanger. I had a hard time putting the book down. I continued to love Thomas, Newt, and Minho. I felt their frustration and hurt for them in their heartbreak. I wanted to whisk them away to a HEA and wished some of the things they went through I could change. I had mixed feeling about Teresa and Brenda. I guess Thomas' feelings of betrayal by Teresa were greater than Brenda's because of the length of their relationship. Brenda was on Thomas' side more, I guess. But then there were the twists to the story that made me go \\"Hmm.\\" I felt bad for Teresa but I also liked Brenda. Oh the dilemmas.<br /><br />I don't want to give any details away. So I'll just say that I really appreciated all the twists and turns of The Death Cure. I liked that not all of our questions are answered. But I also felt like some things seemed a bit contradictory and didn't make sense, perhaps some plot holes, hence why I have a slightly lower rating than the previous books. But I liked the ending even though I don't feel like it was wrapped up with a bow. That's okay. That's life. The characters will still have to deal with the emotional (and physical) consequences of what they went through with WICKED and each other in the future. And I wonder if that little twist at  the end will ever be revealed. Another \\"Hmm\\" moment. So the question remains: Is WICKED good? You'll have to decide for yourself.
B008KE3960|5.0|Great game on the Xoom Tablet. Graphics are great and game play is great. Not too difficult to figure out. Highly recommended.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|This was not a very good book. The characters were flat, the story was full of cliches, and the author has a naive view of technology and literature. It reads a lot like hipster wish fulfillment.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|just downloaded this game and, IT`S AMAZING!!!<br />Great job!!! Rovio and Lucasarts, i am impressed how you mixed star wars and angry birds.<br />So, i have to continue with the game, the galaxy needs me!!!!<br />ulises, Ecuador
B009DH371K|3.0|I had this concert on VHS many years ago. I recall thinking it was okay, but Wembley was better. I was looking forward to the blu-ray release in hi-def since it was shot on 35mm film just like Queen Rock Montreal. The picture quality isn't nearly as good as Montreal.
B00979CS50|5.0|Is there any of the epical magic left in the Neil Young and Crazy Horse tale? Yes. Neil is still the lyrical guitar hero, and Crazy Horse still fills in the background.  When he moves forward by going back, he can still take us on a beautiful ride. I am an old man still excitedly surprised at how good this sounds. The concern we all had about Neil's song writing that he expressed in his book, Waging Heavy Peace, has apparently been settled. Thank you, Neil, for sharing your gifts. Ragged Glory was not the end, after all.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|These boys are one of a kind,and i listen to there music all of the time, they are the next step down from elvis the king in my opinion.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|I had borrowed this book in paper format from a fellow brewer. Once I started reading it, I knew I had to have it for my iPhone. Very informative and excellent material to have right at hand!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|While conceding that I have enjoyed many John Grisham novels, and also conceding that I liked The Racketeer enough to give it 3 stars, there is still a lingering disappointment that this was the best Grisham could do this year. Readers look forward to his really good legal thrillers, and to finish this one only moderately satisfied means we have to wait longer still for him to do his really good stuff. It's a cute story, but the deck seemed so stacked that the suspension of belief required to enjoy it felt really forced. Perhaps Grisham is ready to retire to Antigua and needed a few more bucks before he could go...but, what's he going to read when he gets there? Surely even he wants to read only the best.
B008OOYALE|4.0|the game is good fun to check up on in your downtime. although the swarm of pop up windows every time i open the game can get a little annoying
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is so fun with the dragons and you have to feed them a lot of apples so you have to get this game from the app store
034580404X|5.0|As soon as I started reading, I could not put it down! Love the characters, love the story. I borrowed the first book from a friend. As soon as I finished it I knew I had to have the series for myself so I can read them again and again. I hope that there are more books with the same characters in the future!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was very well written. Could not put it down.<br />Lots of action and emotional at times. I would recommend it to everyone.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was very entertaining and I couldn't put it down!  I would highly recommend this book, especially if you have read the first 2.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|too easy I got tired of the app after about 96 levels do not get unless you are a very boring person and don't want to have any friends.
0007466064|5.0|I am thrilled to finally have received both books part 1 and 2. The book is awesome and I can't wait for HBO to show Game of Thrones again
B009FZHYKU|5.0|No other way to describe this show's greatness.  It's got it all, drama, action, blood, guts, character development, strong acting, edge of your seat sequences, and most importantly ZOMBIES!<br /><br />Highly recommend, you won't regret it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love this game! Slow generating coins at first but when you get to higher levels it's not too bad. Was on level 100 then had to swap out my kindle and even after syncing I lost all my prizes and started at level 1! Really mad I spent money to get coins, don't think I'll do that again just incase I have another problem with my kindle.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really efficient app. It is very easy to use and setup, and honestly a little fun. The bottom line is it works great.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I simply couldn't stop reading, impossible to put the book down! You will be trapped in the story for sure...
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read all the Jack Reacher books but almost passed on this one because of the poor early reviews.  What a mistake that would have been.  Lee Child has once again done a masterful job.  It it truly a fun read.  My problem now is having to wait a year for the next Reacher adventure.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Halfway through the book, I thought I had accidentally switched to another title on my Kindle.  The story line I had been reading disappeared, and the \\"hero\\" was suddenly involved with a completely set of characters and a completely different plot.  It's all explained in the end, but that's part of what annoyed me about this book.  Things happen for no apparent reason, only to be justified by additional information from the narrator a few pages later.  It felt sloppy and rushed to me, as if Grisham had dashed this one off without thinking about it too much (a view that's arguably supported by the Afterward in which he proudly says he made everything up).  As a result, I didn't care about any of the characters.  Nor was I particularly intrigued by the plot.<br /><br />Like all Grisham novels, this book is very readable.  But unlike his earlier works it's forgotten as soon as it's finished.  This is a trifle, a well-written bit of nothing.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|I was very  happy with my video. It was in very good condition, and it played well.<br />It arrived on time too. I have no complaints.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Overall great story. I couldn't wait to find out how it would all come together. I bit wordy in a few parts but otherwise a great read!
