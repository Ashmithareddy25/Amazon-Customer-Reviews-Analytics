B008FPOIT6|4.0|I liked this book.  I wouldn't say it was my most favorite book, but it was definitely enjoyable.  It has a definite modern feel - incorporates Google and modern technology, but isn't overly complex.  You don't need to be \\"in the know\\" or up on the latest internet hype to enjoy the book.  It's a fun read.
B002W7J3SO|3.0|The movie was a little corny but entertaining non the less. Considering their technical abilities for that time, the plane crash scene was pretty amazing.
032180354X|5.0|I think this is a great book easy read and love all the different images in the book showing how to use the lighting.
B00C1C0WCQ|3.0|The movie did not play in its entirety for some reason. It's the first time this has happened with movies from amazon.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I have played this for one evening and enjoyed it. They call the numbers fairly fast. You can play fewer cards.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book is wonderfully crafted. From beginning to end!<br /><br />Likes: How he builds supporting cast as well as protagonist.<br />The flow of the story. It's a moderate pace with great action. The authors words are vivid and allow you to visualize everything.<br /><br />Con: I wish the series was complete. I want answers!!<br /><br />Great book. Read this.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Great game to play between bigger more involved games.  Fun and easy to learn.  Cool education possibilities for a probability lesson.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I love thinking and solving puzzles. I will be waiting patiently for the next floor . Maybe not patiently lol.  Hurry up can't wait  fun fun game
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Really makes you think. Excellent first person narrative with a very original story to tell. Lena is no Bella Swan or too much of a damsel in distress, and I really enjoy her point of view in this society against love. Good read, plan on finishing the next two. After I'm done crying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|the Hunger Games books are the  best. they have romance and action. in Catching Fire there is even a little mystery threw out the book!!!!!!! Best book!! Can't wait for next.<br />When is the MOVIE coming!!!!!!!!!!!

B000000I42|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this. The album came beautifully packaged, and arrived earlier than expected. Not to mention sounds great, just like any vinyl would! There were no flaws, and I am extremely happy with my purchase, not to mention customer service was easy to work with and were fast to reply to my messages. And if you're a Misfits fan...This is a must have! :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app provides a fun distraction. Good use of critical thinking and logic. Game seems quite limited, however ... I await more levels.

1938469003|2.0|Too much emphasis on the history. I bought this for brewing techniques, but the recipes are vague and written in a strange format using percentages as well as not clear hop addition times, only bitter, flavor and whirlpool times...You could make an educated guess about these as well as convert percentages to oz. or grams and make a decent product but most recipes today give a broad amount of information that is very useful, whereas these recipes are rather vague.
B0014JGDUC|5.0|My feet stopped hurting after I purchased these shoes.  Super comfortable and easy to clean.  I recommend these shoes if you're on your feet for hours.  There aren't any mats where I work and I haven't noticed a difference.
B0016PM722|4.0|He's 25 and loves it, but it is a decoration.  Really built well, great sounding.  Weird because an adult can get this and it's cool, yet I wouldn't get it for my 11 year old son, because it's so cool, you know he'll break it.  If they had another saber that was softer as an accessory, kids would probably use it, but this is delicate, heavy and is probably wrong in the hands of a 10-16 year old.  If you're 20 or over and you're going to collect it ahng it on your wall, use it sometimes, then definitely it's for you.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I just received my Anker 8000 DPI gaming mouse a few days ago, so I cannot comment on its longevity or durability, but I thought I'd leave a few notes regarding out-of-box performance.  First off, I am a female gamer who bought this mouse primarily for WoW.  I had looked at the Naga series, and while I was impressed with their mice, I really couldn't drop that kind of cash on them at the moment.  Same with the WoW mice.  I had not heard of Anker prior to this, but the reviews were pretty spectacular, and it was a fraction of the price, so I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />  First off, I immediately put the included weights in the mouse - all of them. The mouse felt very light out-of-box, and I prefer a heavier mouse.  This did the trick, and the weight is now perfect for me.  The mouse is rather large, so this is definitely a mouse for palmers, not clawers, but this was fine for me.  The 3 thumb buttons were in a perfect position for me, and are both easy to use and easy to avoid using (my last mouse had thumb buttons that were extremely sensitive, and were accidentally pushed all the time).<br /><br />  My issues with button placement are that the two buttons in the middle below the scroll wheel are quite uncomfortable to get to without completely changing your hand placement.  Perhaps if my middle finger were longer, I might be able to teach myself to hit those buttons with the bottom of my finger, but the anatomy of my finger and my lack of dexterity does not make this possible for me, leaving those 2 buttons mostly unused.  I also don't love that the button to change your profile is on the bottom of the mouse (and not easy to press), and that there seems to be no clear indication as to which profile you are currently using without opening the mouse's menu.  While this is a minor gripe, it isn't great when you need to change specs quickly.<br /><br />  Also, I don't think it was clear from the description that only the anchor symbol on the palm of the mouseis changeable to the millions of colors, which, if you are a tad OCD like me, would bother me to change it from the standard blue, since the scroll wheel and the DPI indicator on the top left side would remain blue and would not match.  Also, since your palm covers that symbol, it really doesn't matter if you change the color anyway, since you can't see it normally.<br /><br />  I was new to having a gaming mouse, and new to the idea of binding mouse buttons to my actions in game, but I did not find it overly difficult to figure out after looking at it for awhile, though more descriptive instructions would definitely have been nice.  At first I thought that it would not work with my HealBot addon, but it does as long as you remember that shift, ctr, and alt are the 3 thumb buttons, so shift-click is button 4 and click, etc.<br /><br />  Overall, while the mouse is not perfect, it does fit my needs for now.  It is very responsive, comfortable, fairly customizable, and the two different profiles, while probably not enough for people who play more than one game on a regular basis, fit my needs just fine with my one character and two specs.  For the price, it is worth a shot, even with its faults.  And better yet - it did make me a better player to stop being a clicker :)
B000IZ36J4|2.0|Oh my, I am flabbergasted that anyone would love this novel and think this crazy gothic tale a love story. Pure unadulterated awful melodrama. I had trouble watching it. I have to say, of all Bronte etc, this HAS to be the very worst. Again, what the heck is this? But yes,the acting is fine, considering what the actors were given. Fiennes is pure evil, sorry, there is no love in him...at least only sick people can think that what he feels is love. GAWD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best game to take your mind of anything so its a pretty good game try it your going to love it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|My 10 year old loved looking at the weather on this app....until the upgrade. It was intuitive and easy to use. We liked the 36 hour and 10 day forecasts. The other feature that seems to be gone is looking at all locations at a glance.  She was very upset looking at the app on the Fire tonight! Please offer the old versions as an option!!
B006MQRLSA|5.0|I love baseball movies so I was eager to see Moneyball as soon as it came out. This movie did not disappoint. Liked it well enough to purchase it for my Blu-ray collection. Have watched it multiple times. If you love baseball, you've probably already seen it. But even if you don't love baseball, this true story presents an interesting storyline with solid acting performances.
B000HF0J36|5.0|I have watched this movie many times.  It has such great characters played by Thomas Jane, Samuel Jackson, and Ll Cool J.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Wonderful music, superb acting, great story!  Hard to beat anything Maggie Smith does!  See this movie - you won't be disappointed!

B0026ISUUQ|3.0|The novel was not my happiest Le Carre, and its unhappy central characters show up even more devastatingly in film.  The diplomat and his wife are an ill-matched couple who seem determined not to acknowledge their differences, or to express anger at their antipathy.  \\"Tessa\\" and \\"Justin\\" do not evince much love for each other; one is patiently hopeful, introverted, wearing blinkers; the other an impatiently single-minded activist.  Their difference is such that a viewer may at the start be sidetracked wondering how on earth they got together and stayed together.  But wait:  in crisis and later we learn their back-stories and how their natures are challenged.<br /><br />Fiennes is painful to watch, a brilliant piece of acting.  Le Carre is a master, in all his novels, at portraying half-successful people who half-achieve; it is a hallmark of his view of the British Establishment, and especially of its foreign service and allied agencies.  His theme is that \\"you can't win\\", at least not without complete self sacrifice ---- very British.<br /><br />I was not convinced by the parade of happy smiling Africans who blossomed at every glance and touch from the white aid workers; as though this were a Kenyan public information piece inserted in European movies.  Distracting in an otherwise realistic story.
0307987647|5.0|fantastic start easier to read after the series so i can picture charecters better and pick up on missed pieces
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Wish this app worked for Kindle. As others have mentioned, it hangs up during sign in so doesn't sync your data.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Enjoyed the book, definitely shed some tears but I won't spoil it for you. It was a good story and kept me engaged to the end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a really great game wish rarity didn't cost so much but In all I don't think it could be any better
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this novel after having seen the movie and I am glad that I did. If I would have read the book first, I don't think I would have enjoyed the movie as much as I did because all I would have been thinking about is how different the movie was from the book. I loved the book and the movie as two separate pieces. I think the book great gave insight into the characters and the movie focused more on his relationship with Tiffany. Loved both!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|It was a very touching and warm love story. I really enjoy watching it over and over. It was well written, and well done!
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I love the packaging of this set, but the front part of mine (the part with the seal) came unglued from the rest of the packaging. I know Aaron Sorkin writes a LOT into his dialogue but I wish the captions were word for word and not paraphrased, and I wish all seasons had captioning. My only other issue is that if you're not careful you can scratch the disks while placing them in the file slots, or taking them out. If you're careful it doesn't seem to be too bad though
B005K17RU0|1.0|I had this app on my Fire HD was great, loved it. Had to replace the Kindle due to a warranty issue, reloaded the app and now it sucks. The screen size is off so it shows a half of the next screen down one side. The information is laid out differently. Agree with previous reviewer, old version was worth 5 stars, the current version isn't.

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I bought this for the Canon Vixia HF R20--the only mic to come up for this camera when doing a search on Amazon--and my experience, as that of other users, was a complete bust. Volume essentially none-existent. Hugely inferior to the on-board mic. Totally worthless for what I needed it for. One of the biggest disappointments that I've ever had in buying a product from Amazon.

B004FEL6GO|1.0|This is a transformer alright, it transformed my money into trash. I thought it would be low quality but this is absolute garbage. As a robot, it sucks and the limbs fall off. As a car, it sucks.<br />Really, I know quality is not what it used to be but this was a real disappointment. Good thing my son is 5 and doesnt know what a piece of crap this is. The box is gone, but I am still going to try and return it if I can.<br />Get it together China, we dont mind losing our country to you as long as you give us some halfway decent crap to preoccupy us with!
0671646788|5.0|This book was highly recommended and after reading portions of it, I had to admit that Mr. Schwartz writing was clear, concise and inspiring. I passed it on to my grandson who is attending college and he even found it to be a worthwhile read as well as my daughter who recently graduated from college. I'm glad I purchased this book and it will be added to my library.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|Disappointed. I think there is some great guitar solos on here, but the songs just arent that strong. I am a life long hardcore fan, but being that I am broke and am thinking about returning this. Sorry Dave.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I don't k=like many movies.  This is very different, loved, loved, loved.  Highly recommend this to any age.  So cute!
B008Y79HE6|5.0|I liked this so much I bought a copy. I watched it on amazon streaming and the quality was great. Lots of action, and good effects. It is a fun watch. And it could be watched with kids as long as they are prepared.

B00280LYIC|5.0|perfect for young teens interested in Greek mythology like myself. I would definitely recommend for middle school students. good book.
B009QD0MYQ|3.0|The enduring mystery of the music industry is the way that almost nobody gets tired of hearing the same danged thing over and over and over and over again.  The few of us who can't take any more turn to bands like this as an escape from convention, and Amaranthe remains insufficiently different.<br /><br />To that end, it's not male singer Lundberg's fault that I've heard that exact same nondescript voice five hundred thousand times, but I have, and if I want to hear it again I can just turn on the radio and shoot myself.  He needs to be a supporter to Elize, not an equal.  Elize is special and should be showcased.<br /><br />The music is energetic, light on its feet, very fast, and a lot of fun.  But it's simple and leans toward convention with basic instrumentation (guitar, keyboard, drums) and frequent use of the tired verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-chorus motif.
B008OOYALE|3.0|i love this game only one thing its quite expensive if u have no patients i recommend that u sell gold cheaper than sale prices and lower the prices for clearing space like the individual items so its easier to expand and not have the expansion price go up 2000 coins everytime u want to expand
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addicting!!! great graphics, no screen freezes or glitches. You can play it for free, even though it gives you options to buy extras but you don't need them.
0307719219|4.0|The authors make a relatively convincing case that elites run the show in most times and societies.  They create political and economic systems to support their interests.  The political systems drive the economic systems mainly.  These systems are either extractive (dictatorial, concentrated, bureaucratic, stagnant, internally warring) or inclusive(democratic, pluralistic, market based, innovative, growing).  Extractive systems stick around for a long-time because the incentives to keep feeding the elites are self-reinforcing.  There is no way to be \\"half pregnant\\", so elites hold onto power.<br /><br />Through economic changes and accidents of history, inclusive structures are sometimes created.  This requires some degree of central structure.  The successful events take place when multiple interest groups compete for power but none can take back total control.<br /><br />The authors provide dozens of examples, but are not fully convincing.  They repeat their claims.  They don't seem to honsetly look for counterexamples.<br /><br />After this 80% of the book, they turn to providing advice for creating more inclusive societies.  Here they mostly debunk the existing theories that cultural, geographical or knowledge deficiencies cause growth differences.  They also criticize foreign aid as being ineffective because it does not help to overturn the controlling elites.  They strongly predict the end of Chinese growth due to lack of \\"creative destruction\\" and innovation.<br /><br />This is a provocative work that can help to shape future international policy debates.
0756655307|5.0|With all the superhero movies out I use this book often. Some days I just pick it up because I love the artwork. It's  most have if you love comics and have friends that question your knowledge, I show them this bible. I hope they keep update and keep pace with the marvel universe.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|There is NO reason to not own this set on Blu-Ray.  Even with the new movie out, this set stands alone as the definitive collection of the &#34;Christopher Reeve / Richard Donner&#34; era of Superman film making.

0743201140|5.0|This book has been recommended by me hundreds of time over the last 5 years. I bought it this time for a friend.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|I just don't know where to start here. Let's try this. I came to this book with the expectations of someone who had been told this is a spectacular novel. However, I don't have the honor of having been taught this book in an academic setting, nor have I read any other reviews of it. All I really know is that many people think Hemingway is brilliant and this is his first novel and it established him as a major literary voice for his generation. I looked forward to reading it.<br /><br />What intrigues me is the idea that someone would set out to purposely write a novel like this. It meanders along, with nothing in particular to sustain it. There are a few interesting characters, all of whom lack motivation to do anything. I'm wondering if the point of all of this was that the main character has suffered a wound in the war that left him impotent. He's in love with Brett, and can no nothing about it, since she is not the kind of girl to stick with a man who can't satisfy her physically. (Though neither can any other man, since she feels the needs to skip around to each and every man who enters the novel.) Perhaps his impotence was a metaphor for the whole novel, which could never really seem to get going anywhere. A one word title for this book might have been \\"Ennui\\".<br /><br />I was also disappointed that people spoke of this as a novel set in Paris, but that was only about one fourth of it. The rest is set in Spain, and I really have no interest in that country at all. There is a long sequence about fishing, which really helped to set the stage for this backdrop of ennui, and a week long festival of reveling centered around wine and bullfighting, which also keep me on the edge of my ennui-soaked seat.<br /><br />What kept me reading was Hemingway's style, which is always quick and easy to read. This kept me from hating the story. But I really wanted someone to stand up and do something. I was hoping for a really profound tragic ending. But that would have requiredsomeone doing something that would lead to tragic consequences. And that just wasn't going to happen.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Downloaded this on my Kindle Fire HD and have had NO problems, except for the fact that now I cannot stop playing it.  It has several different backgrounds, three different styles of tiles, and about 20 or so different shapes to play.  Complete against other players to beat their time.  I'm very happy with it.  Excellent app!!
B003W77SAS|5.0|If you like a touch of new wave and progress rock mixed with a little bit of weirdness, you'll enjoy this album.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I have enjoyed playing this game so far. It has been a challenge at times but enjoyable. I would recommend it as something out of the norm.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|It was pleasing to read a digital photography book that did not try to fill my head with professional jargon.  I am completely new to digital photography and have found this book (unlike so many others) so easy to understand. Now that I have a better understanding of the basics, I am even keener now to experiment with Manual settings.
B00004WG2F|5.0|This movie is a one-of-a-kind epic into the philosophies of people living in a bygone era.  The focus brings into reality a son marked by his father's dissolution while serving in the army which lead to his involvement in trying to force the American indians from their rightful homes.  The father's disgust with the government's intention sends him to settle in an isolated area (beautiful) to raise his family.  His son's relationships with him and each other lead to totally separated ideas of government and it's right to enforce.  The scenery is beautiful, the characters strong and the traumas real.  Great story of our nations beginnings.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's really cool. I think this is the perfect app for children who want to grow to become animal care takers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I borrowed this through Prime on a whim since I had just seen an ad for the movies and I have today that it is really fantastic. I couldn't put it down! Collins has a real talent for pacing and the social commentary is insightful as well. I highly recommend it.

0307352145|4.0|Author uses a lot of supporting documentation.  She doesn't just throw sentences out at you without backing them up.  I'd never really thought about the differences (extroversion and Introversion) among people, and had always thought of myself as just shy.  Now I appreciate myself and my reserve a little bit more.  Too bad I can't tell you more about the book, because I haven't finished it yet.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new version is horrible. I don't even know why they changed it. I can't find anything useful with the new app and it is not user friendly at all. I am getting rid of this app.

1470335492|4.0|As I listened to the audio version of Sweat Tooth, I couldn't help but think that had it not been Ian McEwan's reputation as a great novelist, I was listening to a run-of-the-mill suspense-spy-romance novel that was not particularly suspenseful. But wait! I reminded myself that McEwan writes literary fiction, works that are supposed to be milestones in our literary culture. Therefore, I tried to pay particular attention. In an audio version, when one cannot skip pages, it is easy to register the fluid prose and indeed, McEwan's writing was serviceable. Nothing stood out, which may be what good writing is--not drawing attention to itself with exceptional sentences or \\"dictionary\\" words most educated people have never heard of. With the exception of his description of some love scenes. Perhaps in an attempt to distinguish his [too?] many such scenes from romance novels, he resorted to some weird words, not ones that would come to the protagonist's mind when in the throes of passion....<br /><br />But what kept me wondering most was the depiction of the protagonist's character, Serena Frome. I've long believed that while female writers can successfully create male characters, it is the rare male author that can created a believable and compellingly authentic female character. I am afraid that in this case, McEwan did less than a spectacular job. With all the outwardly scaffolding he created for her--a degree in Math from Cambridge--she comes across as a spineless female defined entirely by her love relationships, an attribute that he probably would not have assigned a male protagonist. The reader is introduced to each of Serena's past relationships in minute details, some become relevant to the plot, but not in such a compelling way as to leave the reader with a single \\"ah-Ha!\\" moment.<br /><br />I was interested and intrigued by the premise of the novel, the British intelligence unit with the mission of affecting cultural trends by sponsoring writers whose influence on readers would be in line with certain political agendas. The idea behind the scheme was that these sponsored writers would be unaware of the true source of the windfall stipends that allowed them to focus on their respective work. Serena's job was to recruit Tom Haley, with whom she ended up in bed during second first encounter and eventually fall in love.<br /><br />After a while, the story got tedious. I needed to remind myself that in 1972, many workplace policies had not been set, and therefore sexual harassment on part of her supervisor was Serena's private problem to deal with, not the intelligence agency's issue.<br /><br />While the book is not a masterpiece but rather a light romance-spy reading with not much tension, the ending, which I almost skipped, had a nice twist to it, so I am glad I stayed with the book till the end.n readers would be in line with certain political agendas.

It would have been better, if the publisher included more technical illustrations of the ship, alien ship, and the alternate ending concepts, if any.  The actors thoughts or insights were not included in this book.  No post-production artwork or posters for the U.S or the international community?
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I love 3D movies and this is a very good film.  If you have your 3D glasses you will enjoy the way the items just come off the television right into your space.  If you don't have the glasses the 2D version is great as well.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Excellent movie! Clint is taking his talent into his golden years! The supporting cast (supporting is not the correct word here) was excellent.  When you add the two together you can't help but knock one out of the park!  Fully entertaining from start to finish, I hated to have the movie end.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game!! But you have to have facebook and be willing to share the game otherwise you get stuck early on and can't get a higher multiplier or you have to spend real money on the game and a fair amount. Other than that reaaly fun and interesting mindless fun!!!
B009MYARIK|1.0|I normally enjoy Sophie Kinsella books This one was pretty awful. It didn't hold my attention. Better said is beyond boring and overly dramatic. Bad story, bad writing, bad characters.
0812550706|4.0|This is the second copy I have purchased.  Loved the book so much I had to buy me a new one because I forgot who I loaned the book to.  Shipped quick and had no hassel.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I have loved Kinky Boots since the first time I saw it on Direct TV.  It is enjoyable and funny at the same time.  Since purchasing my own, I can now see it when I get ready as well as how many times I want to look at it.<br /><br />It was overly priced for a 2005 movie coming from Amazon.
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|I started with the movie then moved onto the series called Firefly, which I recomend before the movie.  Great story and good action for a Sci-fi.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This book tells the story of a girl who gets into a near-fatal accident, and must choose whether she stays in her body recovering or stops fighting and moves on. While she's making her choice, she goes through a series of flashbacks: her family, her first love, her best friend. She must weigh what her future would be like if she chose to continue her life, which would be more difficult now than before the accident.<br /><br />I read through the entire book in an afternoon. For such a short read, the characters were pretty well-developed. I enjoyed the story, but it didn't blow me away. Some parts were predictable and there was a bit of cliche teenage romance involved. Overall, I consider it a pretty good read.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Good cd. This band is going forever. I play they<br />cd`s again and again. I am waiting for the next one.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Electric is a return to the Pet Shop Boys that we know and love.  There are some fantastic tracks on here and one flows right on to the next.  I have been waiting for the boys to make another great dance album and with Electric, they have done just that.  For me, The highlights of the album are &#34;Axis&#34;, &#34;Thursday&#34;, &#34;Flourescent&#34;, &#34;Vocal&#34;, and &#34;Love Is A Bourgeois Construct&#34;.  Lets hope the boys keep their creative juices flowing with their new record label.
B00144VBBS|5.0|This was a dobbel Cd, but one of the disc`s, disc 2, was<br />some kind of punk music, not cd-2, and it was damage.<br />Have to say it was a total disaster.<br /><br />Is it money back or new cd garanted ?
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I am very pleased with this DVD.  The quality of the DVD case is good, and the presentation is great as well.  The film itself is fantastic; an all-time classic.  If you haven't seen it and you're a Batman fan, then do yourself a favor and get this movie.  Give it a chance and I bet you won't be sorry.  As far as special features go, you definitely will not be disappointed.  The second disc is loaded with features that serve as a perfect companion to the film.  There is also a DVD commentary by Director Tim Burton on the first disc.  In my opinion, the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD is the only way to go.  Honestly, I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I would recommend it to anybody who loves good movies.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|my two year old loves this game...we have all the Dr panda games and he loves them all! love it!
0140282033|5.0|I don't even know why I'm bothering to review this book when my comments will only add to the symphony of praise here!  I first saw the movie before learning there was a book; now I love both.  Chocolat is especially fascinating because it treads a fine border between magic and the mundane.  In Harry Potter, there, too, is a boundary between \\"magic\\" and \\"normal,\\" but the boundary is much more distinct.  You're either a \\"muggle\\" or you're not.  In Lord of the Rings, the whole world is, well, another world; although it may share similarities to our world, it is still Middle Earth--not OUR Earth.  Chocolat is set in our world; Vianne, her daughter, and the people she meets in the quaint French village are relatively 'normal' people in that they don't use magic wands, fight with epic swords, cross parallel universes, or what have you.  Yet even so, there is something magical about the way Vianne creates her chocolate and, in the process, affects the lives of everyone in the village.  Although the story mentions \\"magical\\" artifacts like tarot cards, it never really asserts what should be believed or what is real/magical and what isn't.  You're left wondering, does Vianne really have some supernatural powers that allow her to, say, divine the desires of others?  To read her future in the cards?  Or is it more the nearly-supernatural power of great intuition?  Are you born with magic, or can you learn to acquire it through a more open-minded, insightful perspective on life?  This is what I love about the book most--not to mention Joanne Harris's writing voice makes the story a delight to read and easily a page-turner.  Chocolat makes you look for the everyday magic in your own life, and we could all use a little magic...
B001I45UFC|1.0|I liked but as it went on it seemed so old and written very weird but other than that it was a good story
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|What a great movie.  Not too far off from the book. Probably due to time considerations, only a few things were left off.  I highly recommend you see this.
B003F3NDWG|2.0|So disappointed in this movie, won't buy any others. Boring, unlike the TV shows, that's for sure! Lost his edge.
B005C4444C|5.0|As I enter my mid-thirties, my taste in movies has evolved. In the current age of reboots, sequels, prequels, superhero movies, and unrealistic/ unnecessary CGI, I now find myself gravitating towards hidden or under appreciated gems like Mr. Nobody, The Fountain, Enter the Void, etc.    At the forefront of Mr. Nobody is the question- exactly how did I get to this point in time?  The movie is great in showing various butterfly effects on our main character, Nemo, and his many parallel lives.  A leaf here, a raindrop there, all have significant repercussions on the story and lives of Nemo which unfold in a nonlinear narrative.  It is quite entertaining watching Nemo's multiple lives unfold, all with seamless transitions and editing under the watchful eye of director Jaco Van Dormael.    The steady constant in this film, is the acting- it is top notch across the board.  The children, teenagers, adults, and supporting cast all bring their A game in this movie, as this film boasts incredible performances by Jared Leto, but most notably, the two teenagers playing Nemo and his girlfriend Anna.    While heavy on emotion and substance, this movie also boasts incredible special effects used sparingly and effectively.  The level of detail put into the Future and Mars tangents will rival any big budget sci-fi blockbuster.    As each separate tangent weaved in and out of the movie, I often found myself dwelling on my own life, and how some of life's little decisions and chance occurrences helped shaped me for better or worse.  This is what I really like about a good film. I need to be entertained, but I also want to think past the content and reflect on how the story relates to me, the individual.    I can't wait to watch Dormael's next masterpiece.  Until then, I highly recommend- enjoy!!
B001UJSW7S|5.0|This is the best recording of this opera. No wonder 'Die tote Stadt' was Puccini's favourite opera. It's also worth having a listen to the recording by Sebastian Weigle.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is A Cool App I Got It For Free But I Would Pay 10 Dollars For It That's How Cool It Is I Got Up To 165 Golden Buttons  I Got That Many In 2 Days

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! The antics of the minions make me laugh. I like the variety of boards,they keep it interesting even when having to repeat a level multiple times.
055358202X|5.0|This is an excellent book. I don't know why but it draws you in to the characters.<br /> It is a continuation of the HBO show so it was nice to be able to read ahead.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game kept my boys busy for hours and we all play it together too! The 8 yr old cleared a bunch of levels but my 6 year old had a little bit of a hard time with it but he still loves it!

B0064X7FVE|1.0|their head has has swollen that they think there film maker's to I'm important and that we'll name winter storms.  that now let's really beef up ads so we can money so as long as money come in who care that we can't make an app money is what I care about.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like the minions out of despicable me and even despicable me 2 then trust me you will like this game because you get to dress your minion up into different costume and you get to buy stuff with bananas.  YUM YUM!!!!!
B000I3PERS|4.0|Yeah - if you're into history this movie (along with &#34;The Patriot&#34;) will make you cringe - that said, if you're into historical adventure Braveheart is the bomb.  Sort of Depicting the life and times of William Wallace, Guardian of Scotland in the very late 1,200s.  Watch it for the fun and then read  &#34;William Wallace. The True Story of Braveheart&#34; by Chris Brown for the real story.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book 5 continues on the great saga that is Song of Ice and Fire, and does it good. New intriguing characters appear and of course old loved ones come back to entertain us. Great read, good Kindle product!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|The Clifton Chronicles continue to entertain and surprise. Sometimes middle books of a trilogy can be dry but Best Kept Secrets continues the storyline and adds very exciting twists and turns. I can not wait for the next phase of the Clifton story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game had me hooked since day one! Great game for all ages!  I recommend it to anybody interested in horses. It's not perfect but hey, what is?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a good read. Very imaginative, well thought out, and easy to get &#34;sucked in.&#34; I could really see the characters and the places as described.
B00BJDARGO|4.0|a short concert but great video but not great sound at all... but it's a great experience have a whitesnake on blu ray ...
0783225857|5.0|I bought this movie for my son....for a school project. But after sitting with him and watching the movie...wow, very powerful and educational!
B0016J81B4|1.0|The product arrived with problems should be more careful when sending products as the eye can see that the product was damaged
0385535147|5.0|I almost always enjoy Grisham's books. This one had<br />a very good plot and was one of the best of his stories.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome. I have finish the hole game .it is so easy to defeat the levels .BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought this book to read for a book club but I'm really sorry that I did. I hated the writing style, hated the characters and truly despised the ending. It seemed like the author just gave up in the last 25 pages. I certainly won't be buying anything else by this author.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Rednecks is so much fun and the others are either fun or nostalgic.  Good old country music just like it's supposed to be.  I'm hooked on Blake Shelton to begin with so anything he does pleases me.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Did not put this book down until I finished it!! - well worth the money. Looking forward to the next one.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love Michael if your a fan its great good song choices.Its vintage Buble Im sure you will enjoy it as I do.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this for my camping kit because it is small and lightweight. For the price, I wasn't expecting great quality, so I was surprised to find that this is a sturdy, well built little unit. And wow, does it sharpen a knife! I have run a series of knives through this sharpener, including kitchen knives, a couple Gerber and Buck pocket knives, my Leatherman, and my well used and dull camping knife. In short time, all of my knives have perfect sharp edges!<br /><br />This sharpener is perfect for campers, hunters, fishermen, soldiers, and anyone out in the field. I am buying another one to keep in my toolbox. Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multi-function Sharpener earns five stars in my book.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't like giving really bad reviews, but this is an exception. It didn't work before I uninstalled the app. I reinstalled the app and guess what?  It doesn't work. So don't get this app. It's a waste of time.
B009YMNVMO|5.0|My daughter has not stopped watching this film and singing the songs. The quality is top-notch, as you would expect from the creators of Ice Age. The music is also great, so it is not bothersome for parents to hear in the background. I also recommend the Angry Birds Rio game app.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This was a great story. It's set in the world of Elantris, though you wouldn't know it without doing some research. Good for quick burn through.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Definitely a good book. I wish it had a centralized main character instead of just accounts of several individuals. One things I really enjoyed was that the book was so logical and believable when describing how countries and politics played into the zombie apocalypse. Very detailed and overall fun and exciting read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very good game really enjoy playing it. Very addictive but fun for any one shame about all the face book post that comes up most of the time
B009VIZDLI|1.0|I agree with Joanna's review; this book doesn't live up to the hype. It's not the slightest bit funny, Don is irritating rather than engaging and I'm not getting a sense of Rosie at all. With so many really fantastic and funny Australian novels it's disappointing to see this book getting so much interest.<br /><br />It is possibly unfair to review a book when I'm only a third of the way through and giving up. Although plenty of people obviously enjoyed this book there are some of us who are really wishing we had saved our money.<br /><br />I'd suggest Kindle readers get the sample and if it doesn't grab you immediately don't bother with it.
1591844096|5.0|I've bought this book for several of my friends and colleagues. Seth's fresh perspective on the art of doing meaningful work turned my world around when I was ready to throw in the towel! good stuff!
B000FC130E|5.0|The concept is totally original.  Quirky and funny mixed with a good scare combine to give any age a great read.  I fell in love with the characters...not all of whom were admirable.  Great story!  Beautiful writing.
B0086213XW|2.0|I really like Seth Rogan and Michelle Williams. Together their chemistry in this film is great! However, when Michelle's character starts having an affair with the character Daniel, I started to skip parts of the movie. Their relationship felt really flat. He has absolutely zero personality, vs Rogan's character. This made the sexually explicit parts of the movie painful to watch; I skipped through those, too. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over!
1451695195|5.0|An interesting Documentary of life after death from a Neurosurgeon who experienced it firsthand. Whether you are a believer or not in life after death, this neurosurgeons account will Definitely give you something to talk and think about this topic. An easy read, including all of the medical terms and conditions which He explains and documents his afterlife experiences.
B008602KQI|3.0|I rented this to see what all the hubbub was about, and I must tell you..it didn't make me swoon or get weak in the knees. I found it a bit on the silly side and the absolute disparity between the Haves and the Havenots<br />made me almost turn the thing off. But thankfully, I hung in there and found it had turned around somewhat for me. Jennifer's character was quite endearing towards the end and made the whole  movie worth the watch! I ended up liking it. :)
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|Just retread the book for the third time,still a favorite.  Must say, the whole world is so amazingly set up. I've read reviews of people saying how Collins underestimates the parental protection instinct, and how a parent would never let there kids go like that, and how there would never be no rebellions. thing is, there were rebellions. small ones, albeit, but punished cruelly and immediately. A very effective means of control- this whole world makes sense to me. A terrifying sense, but sense. I've read the entire trilogy, and I was very disappointed. Catching Fire was ok, but Mockingjay was horrible. In my option, at least. But, wrong book review! Overall, A fantastic book, written surprisingly well for such a crash hit and an overwhelmingly engaging read. Just a damn shame that it followed the classic trilogy spiral.
0307476073|4.0|I haven't read this book yet. It was easy to download from the Internet. It looks interesting and I will probably enjoy reading it.
B00000IZOR|5.0|This is a nice toy. It seems to be sturdy. I play with my son and he loves it, that's what matters
B004SCN2F6|3.0|Too Basic and after awhile a bit boring, actually have stopped playing, after about one month. Was hoping for more
0143122010|5.0|It's a big, thick book, but that's in large part because it is so very full of facts: tables and charts, references, footnotes, index: this is a work that is bound to show up on required reading lists in sociology classes, political science classes, perhaps philosophy and others.<br /><br />Pinker has gathered this impressive array of data to make one point:  we are growing nicer over time.  We are experiencing a humanizing, civilizing force that has reduced violence of all kinds, from war and murder to schoolyard bullying.  An important part of that is attitude shifts: we tend to go from acceptance of brutality to discussions about it, to reducing the incidence, to finding what remains completely unthinkable.  The statistics on infanticide are, to me, the defining example.  It used to be common for newborns to be killed or abandoned for any number of reasons, and nobody talked about it.  The shift -- uneven across cultures, but downward over the whole world -- makes a study of interest to everyone, and Pinker gives us plenty of detail.  But he does that for every category of nastiness, and that adds up to a large, well-written, very readable book.<br /><br />You do not have to be all that well educated, or any sort of specialist, to appreciate this book.  In fact, I recommend it to pretty literally everyone.
B002N5KVDG|4.0|FINALLY, all the idiots that have said his previous endeavors are &#34;just like DK&#34; can make that statement with some accuracy. While it is not DK (and shouldn't be) it is an awesome release. Reminds me of my roots and good ol fashion &#34;punk.&#34; Good songs, thought provoking lyrics and its always good to have a genius like Jello making his thoughts accessible to the world
B003U6BE8I|5.0|If you like Narnia, Ember City....etc. its a must see. I'm 54 and I enjoyed so much, I am going to buy a copy.
B00DU73T08|3.0|If you did not read the book you would not understand it. If you did read the book it didn't follow but ended in the same place
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Too many naysayers writing \\"words of wisdom\\" regarding how unfair it is for the producers of this masterpiece to wait and charge additional fees for an extended version.  These blockbusters only become a reality because they make money to fund the dreams of the creators.  Without a huge profit margin, the dreams die.  I would really have loved to have seen several more X File motion pictures.  It isn't going to happen because reviewers killed the last one and \\"fans\\" did not purchase the DVDs.  I never thought this great work would see the light of cinemascope much less 3D. Quit your complaining and buy the DVDs.  Let the money moguls make their greenbacks. The payoff for you is that more dreams come to fruition and we benefit by watching these glorious productions in our home theaters.  If you can't afford them, then that is another matter.  However, you are making an attempt to stop other consumers from purchasing the product which has the same aim a a boycott.  \\"Gee we would have liked to have financed another Lord of the Rings film but we just didn't make the profit margin secondary to lack of DVD sales.\\"  Doesn't sound that far fetched now does it?  Buy the damn DVDs - both versions - and help finance the dreams.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I could not put the book down, but absolutely hated the ending.  Gillian needs to write a second book on how Nick's wife get what she has coming to her.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Its very fun but, they need levels to unlock the locked items. Love the game though!  Unlocked most items for me.
1451695195|4.0|I wondered what this book said.  It is quite an interesting read and although I don't buy all of it, it is a good thing to get you started thinking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This to me is an awesome temple run remix and if you liked the game temple run or temple run 2 you should get this game
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|You might like this movie if you enjoyed:<br />The Amityville Horror (1979/2005), The Shining (1980), Insidious (2010)<br /><br />Long Story Short: In this movie based on true events we get to know the Perron Family, that moves in a new home and experiences horrific events due to spirits living in their house. They seek the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren, so called demonologist specializing in ghosts and spiritual activities.<br /><br />Review: For weeks I have been so obsessed about this movie that I actually read plenty of reviews and watched interviews, which built up my expectations too high I guess. Judging by what everyone else has said, I was expecting to be at the edge of my seat, biting on my finger nails, occasionally covering my eyes, maybe even scream out loud. But that was not the case. Nonetheless I did enjoy The Conjuring, because it doesn't rely on over-the top gore effects or people jumping out of a dark corner, as a matter of fact certain scenes actually make your heart beat faster just because you think something is going to happen, and then... nothing. But then you don't expect it, and it happens. The cast was terrific. Vera Fermiga is a very charismatic actress, I would almost say like a young Meryl Streep, and she brought life into this movie, but so did Patrick Wilson. And let's not forget about Lily Taylor, who definitely needs more roles.<br />If you have seen Insidious you will definitely find similarities as far as the shock moments go. James Wan is a great director, who knows how to create an atmospheric horror thriller with great cinematography. His secret is to use his own fears to create the mood of the movie (see interview below).<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5<br /><br />To see the more reviews please VISIT my blog [...] LIKE my Facebook page [...] and FOLLOW me on Twitter:  @SimonSays_Watch

B004HWYTP4|4.0|This was a fun, American action movie! The characters were a good mix, the plot interesting enough, and the action good. Nice relaxing summer movie.
1475143389|5.0|This is a must for anyone interested in working on a better body. Mike Matthews has a simple plan for workouts and diet laid out in this book. I have been working out hard for 4 years and felt like I was at a dead end. After just 1 week after reading this book and using his techniques, I feel revived and motivated to workout. It's like a bible for the bodybuilder. I think he's got this bodybuilding down pat. After reading it, I realized what I was doing wrong with my workouts and diet and know what I need to change now. All of the magazines I've read have all types of workouts that don't ever seem to work. This book destroys the magazines! It is definitely the best book on body building I have ever read.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Good price and exceptional delivery process. This DVD was a great addition to my library. It was a good price and the delivery exceeded the estimate. I found no issues with the DVD itself, which recently isn't something that be said about some of their other DVD sets.
B004WR125O|4.0|The Onkyo LAN adapter  is great!  I plugged it into my Onkyo A/V receiver and immediate had a wireless connection with my router and network system.  I put in the password to join my network,,, and in seconds I was finished.  It has everything I like.. easy to install, automated hookup...  no problem connection!  It's great!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Great game for all ages.  Graphics are awesome, and the music is cute.  Very entertaining.  Challenging, but not frustrating.  Great time passer.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|INTRO<br /><br />So, the movie starts off with Nick (Played by Ryan Reynolds) and Roy (Played by Jeff Bridges, I believe he's found his calling) chasing a very large CGI Scottish man, that makes Fat Bastard look attractive, and we're told that just 4 days earlier Nick had no idea he would be doing this.<br /><br />Cut to the next scene and Nick is digging in his back yard and we see that he buries what appear to be pieces of Gold and marks the spot by putting an Orange tree on top of it (An Orange tree in Boston? Hmm).  The movie then cuts to a scene where he's waking up and his girlfriend is telling him there's an orange tree and the back yard.  Nick then goes to work as a member of the Boston Police Department where he tells his partner Hayes (Played by Kevin Bacon) that he cannot keep the gold and he's going to turn it into evidence.  Hayes says, I've been feeling the same way and I'm going to do the same.<br /><br />Next up, the two partners (Nick and Hayes) are leading a raid on the biggest Meth House in the city.  One thing leads to another and Nick goes chasing the kingpin of the Meth operation up several flights of stairs where, he runs into Hayes who tips him off that he's the kingpin, tells him he cannot let him turn the gold in, and then proceeds to shoot Nick in the face where by, Nick falls 3 stories to his death.  Upon his ascent to judgement Nick is intercepted by the R.I.P.D or Rest In Peace Department where, he is told that this is his only chance to redeem himself of being a crooked cop and he agrees.  Before you know it, he's being partnered up Roy who coincidentally was also murdered by his own partner.<br /><br />THE STORY AND SCRIPT<br /><br />Keep in mind, we're still within the first 20 minutes of the movie and we've already set the stage for what will be an interesting story that comes off without being predictable even if it doesn't have many plot twists.  The partners and their lines are both colorful enough and yet different enough to keep you entertained.<br /><br />The Script itself, has few holes, plenty of action, some very funny dialogue, and as I said before it is overall very entertaining.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERS<br /><br />Nick seems to me to be just another Ryan Reynolds part where more of Ryan comes out than Nick but, over all he doesn't distract from the movie.<br /><br />Roy is a sober version of Rooster Cogburn but, I seriously welcomed this as that role was Jeff Bridges best acting job in my opinion!  I very much like that he brought this presence and atmosphere to this movie.<br /><br />Hayes has a bit of a two faced edge two him and honestly comes off with a little bit of a Tyler Durden leadership presence without the multiple personality disorder.  Not a bad job here by Kevin Bacon but, not up to his acting in X-Men First Class.<br /><br />THE EFFECTS<br /><br />I don't know why but, CGI has been annoying the heck out of me lately and this movie is no different.  I think the problem with CGI is that it is an attempt to bring to life the visions we all had as kids but, it does this through computers that are clearly missing something. So, for me, my imagination just always seemed more real growing up and these effects just aren't living up to the presence that the likes of Lucas Arts, Industrial Light and Magic, and many other effects groups brought to the table.<br /><br />So, were the effects bad?  No but, they weren't realistic either.  Kind of like the way Lou Ferigno's hulk was very realistic and the latest Avengers version of the Hulk looks good but, he's clearly animated and nobody would ever question that.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />I really liked this movie, it was entertaining and fun without being too serious.  Was it like Men in Black?  I thought it was going to be at first but, to me the story wasn't as far fetched and neither were the villains.  I would also sooner believe that Bridges is a Frontier Lawman and Reynolds is a modern cop before I would believe that either Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones were any serious lawmen.<br /><br />Should you see this movie?  If you're looking for an entertaining escape from reality?  Sure I would say go see it but, if you're the type that hates all things fantasy, then you might want to pass this one up.<br /><br />for the record, I would not say this is a 4 star movie but, it doesn't deserve a 3 either so maybe 3.5 stars would be more appropriate or 7 out of 10 as it was a good movie but, not a blockbuster.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent reading. Hard to put the book down, there is a deeper story than just sex. Going to start book three in a few day
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book,true story? Are we to wonder which version is the truth? I would absolutely recommend this book to all. I did not see the movie, but I probably will now.
159463176X|4.0|`I loved the story and author's writing. Each night I looked forward to reading another chapter. RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS ESPECIALLY MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A WRITER HERSELF.Looking forward to reading his other novels.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing. but really long. I think that it would be a good fit for like a 5th or 6 th grader to like relate to.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Even though I often beat it, the computer rolls way too many doubles and even still makes ridiculously stupid move mistakes. It is fast paced and fun for a few games, but then I get annoyed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with the previous two, I had to force myself to stop reading in order to eat, etc. I was taken by surprise the twists that I never saw coming. I also know that I will reread them because I was in too much of a hurry to find out what happened next.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see the film adaptations. As with the \\"Harry Potter\\" movies, liberties will be taken in order for the movie to produce the same reaction while one watches it, as the books do while reading them.
0307913090|5.0|Voice is awesome. Love listening...makes rush hour commute fly by.  Watched HBO series first, series stays true to book so far.  Wanted to learn a little morw about each character and I believe I am.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is entertaining and addictive, it's just like the the actual card game I used to play for hours over a pot of earl grey tea.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|One of his best albums ever. Like the sound and lyrics even though most of them are explicit, don't bother - Welldone!
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love every single song in this album! When I listen, I can imagine myself living in a village or riding a horse in the medieval period. Very refreshing. My only issue is that it did not come in the standard CD case, but my friend has informed me that this is an eco-friendly development – which I am totally for.
B001RNO79E|5.0|I was wary about purchasing the Teva Men's Riva Leather eVent because of the reviews that stated that its fit was small, but I took the plunge anyway and bought a pair in the size that I normally use.  To my pleasant surprise, it was an exact fit!  The leather finish of the shoes is great.  The style is very smart and sporty.  Didn't have to break them in.  I've been using them daily for several days now, and feel great walking in them.  Plus, I've received several comments on how good the Tevas looked.  I realize that others may have had problems with size fit, but I didn't.  And I'm glad I followed my guts and bought in my regular size.  It occurs to me now that it could be possible that the other sizes were not manufactured in the proper scale....but that's just a thought.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love that this book was from the guy's point of view. It's nice to see where he is coming from and what he is feeling. It had me laughing out through out the whole book. I loved this book. I loved his insights into what men think and how they interpret things. Awesome job!!
B002SSBD6W|5.0|Although the book started with some gruesome, if true, facts about factory farming, it ultimately presented a wealth of information and an informed discourse on why, and should, we eat animals. Helpful that he came to the same conclusions as me, the author also helped verbalized many of the sentiments which I feel and could not express. I do wish that the book had started with more approachable imagery, because I fear my friends will choose not to read the most important sentiments, which come towards the end. In this sense, I would recommend Food Revolution by John Robbins instead. However, I would most certainly recommend this book to anybody open to vegetarianism or veganism looking to define their stance on the issue. Foer presents several viable options, all improvements on the current American reliance on factory farmed meat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game to play with parent and child or any other pairing. challenging on memory skills...might need a pencil and paper to jot down codes
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have loved this app so much! I kinda inherited my tendency to be a little bit of a news and weather junkie!  It comes in so handy when planning trips; I have the areas of friends and family as other destinations and it is neat to see how weather is so different in places. I find it to be so cool to see how weather is so varied all across my big old state of Texas!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am by now and a super user, but Evernote is super handy for me to clip recipes, articles, and pics.  I then pull these up later on my phone or kindle while I'm out shopping.  Love. Love. Love.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|The First Law trilogy joins the ranks of such writers as George R.R. Martin, Steven Erikson, and Glen Cook in the new wave of fantasy which began with A Game of Thrones. Violence, adult material, and a sufficiently convoluted storyline await you in The Blade Itself.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have said, the characters make this novel. You'll find nothing of the epic ambition of Erikson in this, or the excellent writing of Martin, but the characters carried me through this book and probably will you too. It's told in a straightforward manner, sparing little thought for beautiful descriptions or literary quality, and the story is pretty easy to follow (though the absence of a map was annoying). It's a fun read, not much to get absolutely amazed over, but it will sweep you through to the end and leave you asking for more.<br /><br />My one gripe, I suppose, was the ending. No real spoilers, but after following the intricate and interesting lives of the multiple POV characters, I was a bit let down when at the end they all decided to get together and go on a quest. It seemed kind of forced. But overall, it's a good book, well worth the reading.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Excellent! A must watch! It seems that Amazon is the ONLY place to watch (on Prime), Falling Skies is NOT on Netflix!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a tale woven of music and heart and is a glorious read. It pulls us in, shines new light on storytelling of an old fable, and does not disappoint.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Considering that the app costs 99&cent; it should have more weapons but all in all it is a good app.
034580404X|5.0|I held off buying this series until the hype died down but I really enjoyed them.  The shipping and everything went well.  A good buy!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Lost this in a move and didn't realize how much I enjoyed it until my favorite radio station played one of the songs.  So glad I found a great vendor to help me reconnect.
B002R88G5E|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. The author writes in such a way that he takes you to Afghanistan. I can't put this down
B008LG6SXS|1.0|I Tried To Use This app....Every Time I Would Start A Search, It Would Give Me An Error And Close.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An excellent book that kept me turning the pages, Go ahead and get it, you won\\"t be disappointed for a second.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun for kids to adults. Hard to put down. Excellent Minion gibberish in the audio track. That is my favorite part.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps me entertained for hours.  I can't get enough.  Every level is unique and it keeps me guessing.  The best game I have played yet.
B008CRC506|5.0|Huge fan of the show and miss it terribly.  Nice to be able to revisit it when I want.  Looking forward to season 2.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Kind of nothing really.<br />Cruise doesn't manage to summon anything to create what could have been another great wacky character part<br />like he did so brilliantly in &#34;Tropic Thunder&#34; (except for one little thing he does towards the end which did crack me up).<br />He's flat and predictable and you could have cast almost anybody in the part.<br />Every body is fine.  The songs don't gain in anyway.<br />The best part of the film is Alec Baldwin's pairing with Russell Brand.<br />Their musical number is fantastic.<br />Otherwise an interesting cast that aren't really able to make this film ever really take off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is the best. sometimes, though, it freezes. that's kind of annoying. other than that, this is an amazing app.
B007SXB498|5.0|This story is a true classic and MUST be read and re-read again and again.  Each character develops beautifully and grows into their own as well as growing in your heart.
0399159029|5.0|The last few Berine Gunther novels were good, ([[ASIN:0143116487 A Quiet Flame: A Bernie Gunther Novel]], [[ASIN:0143118536 If the Dead Rise Not: A Bernie Gunther Novel]], [[ASIN:B004OR10J0 Field Grey: A Bernie Gunther Novel (Bernie Gunther Mystery 7)]]) but certainly not of the caliber of the first in the series ([[ASIN:0140231706 Berlin Noir: March Violets; The Pale Criminal; A German Requiem]]).  It is nice to see that Kerr - and the cynical, dark detective Bernie Gunther - is back.  Set in the fall of 1941 and spring of 1942, Gunther is once again summoned to reluctantly work for Heydrich who has just been appointed to govern Czechoslovakia (\\"Bohemia and Moravia\\" as the Nazis referred to it), and who suspects that there are attempts being made on his life.  Given Heydrich's cruelty and brutality, this isn't difficult to imagine.  As Gunther begins to dig around, one of Heydrich's adjutants is murdered.  What follows is a \\"closed room\\" murder mystery not unlike Agatha Christie's [[ASIN:0007451563 Murder of Roger Ackroyd]].<br /><br />The plot is part detective mystery, part spy-thriller, and Kerr does a masterful job of pulling seemingly disconnected events, characters and crimes together; this is his best writing (plot-wise) in a while.  The elements that make Gunther such a complex (and likable) character are also well developed here, as he pushes the buttons of high-ranking Nazis takig full advantage of Heydrich's favor - some of the scenes are down-right humerous, as Kerr shows the hyprocrisy of the Nazis as clearly as he shows their evilness.  Even the resolution of the crime was better developed than Kerr has written previously: some elements were easy to resolve, the conclusion was not without its surpises.<br /><br />A great story with a great cast of characters, I highly recommend the Bernie Gunther series, and especially recommend this story.
B002ZG997C|3.0|I liked the story but it was too violent for me. I do not ever watch<br />an R rated movie. But other than that it was good. Thank you for asking
B00860YICC|5.0|The Legend of 1900 is, in MY opinion, the best movie, music, actors, and screenplay I have EVER seen.  I am so proud of this film, and had nothing to do with it except be fascinated by it.  I watch it over and over........and over.  I have never been so thrilled to own my own DVD......
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It is obvious that Peter Jackson gets Middle Earth.<br />His vision is so all encompassing and strong that it is always a joy to return.<br />Comparing &#34;The Hobbit&#34; to &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; his touch is a little more goofy and almost slapstick at times.<br />There are more set pieces with the troop of dwarves and Bilbo and they tend towards the comedic:<br />trees filled with dwarves falling down and that sort of thing.<br />But hey, it's still Middle Earth and a delight to be there.  If you liked &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; you know you are going to watch it.<br />I know many who were disappointed because of what I said above, but I obviously was not.<br />Watching the trailer for the next installment, I wonder if I will feel the same way if this lighter comedic tone continues.<br />(There is a scene with the dwarves in barrels going down a raging river that feels similar to the tree scene in this film<br />and it made me worry a bit)
1594481717|4.0|THIS BOOK OPEN YOUR EYES TO SEE, A WHOLE NEW WAY OF THINKING.<br />I PERSONALY LIKE THIS BOOK.YOU WILL TOO.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is one of those pieces you get into quickly and simply cannot put down.  I kept hoping, as I came to the end, that there was more of this story to be read.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|Great flick and special effects were good considering this was an 80's movie.  Interesting story and liked the ending.  If you like sci-fi, then you'll love this movie.
0316010669|3.0|Enticing, yes; we follow the same characters and situations throughout the demo; psycho smart.<br />Interesting subject: decision making processes.<br />Yet past the enjoyment of being captured in all the mental cleverness, I don't get much out of this type of work.<br />Being myself an intuitive, I got validation as the author explains why this mode of decisoion making is as good or even better as any. Thanks !<br />But...I guess \\"all mental\\" is not what I appreciate most as far as writing goes...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game.  can't wait for more levels . not to easy and not to hard. my kids are going to love this.
B000OXHRRC|3.0|Perfectly enjoyable fare.  The other side of the coin from the actor and director who gave you &#34;Gladiator&#34;.<br />Ridley Scott is a master of his craft who knows what he is doing (though is also capable of incredible stinkers)<br />and this is a heartfelt film about a man whose soul is on the verge of being lost in the cold world of finance<br />when he has to deal with the estate of a recently deceased uncle who figures in one of the most special, long<br />ago summers in Crowe's character's life.  Almost forgotten, he is forced to remember his uncle's loving wisdom<br />as he deals with the home he has been left in the south of France.<br />It's touching, it's predictable and it's a nice simple feel good ride.<br />It's nice to see Crowe do something other than his moping serious larger than life characters and he is<br />surrounded by the obligatory group of interesting, sometimes wacky characters.<br />Saturday night on the couch with a date or spouse and you'll feel all warm and cozy afterwards.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Excellent little contraption. For lump charcoal users, it works like a CHARM. And since lump charcoal comes in many different shapes & sizes, some of the \\"smaller\\" pieces might fall threw the chimney grates. Just place a few larger pieces in first then pour charcoal into the chimney. You may find yourself manually moving the lump around inside the chimney to make more room but that's it. It's ideal tool for my Jumbo Joe.<br /><br />I lit my Lighter Starter cubes, and placed the chimney loaded with lump charcoal over the lit cubes. In about 20 minutes, I had blazing hot charcoals. Furthermore, the handle didn't even get hot. I was able to pour the HOT coals into my grill without the need for a mitt or glove.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS:<br />- Load your chimney starter with charcoal and place one or two or three LIGHTER cubes under the chimney starter and light. I tend to use no more than two lighter cubes. Wait about 15-25 minutes for the charcoals to glow, then pour into your grill.<br />- DO NOT fire-up a chimney starter on the grass or sidewalk or patio. The heat from the chimney starter will cause severe damage to the surface. I use two old bricks to support my chimney starter, that way, only the bricks get scorched.<br /><br />AND STOP USING NEWSPAPER TO FIRE-UP A CHIMNEY STARTER! That's an order.<br /><br />Who would've thunk it, a Hawaiian Punch can to light charcoal. Take a Hawaiian Punch can, remove the top & bottom, cut-out some holes and slots, slap on a heat-shield and a nylon handle, and you got yourself a chimney starter. One may call it a VERY good chimney starter, I call it  very GOOD Hawaiian Punch can.<br /><br />Bottom-Line:<br />Highly Recommended
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This novel is like a giant chase scene, without the cars. When I picked it up to read it, two days later I realized I did not clean my house, brush my teeth, or remember eating. Totally gripping. Ms. Morton's writing style is ingenious.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|Not as good as Koyaanisqatsi.  I think it is because of the music.  They really did something special in that movie and I can't quite describe why.  Samsara is as close as you're going to get though.  There are some disturbing scenes in this movie concerning the modern Asian meat producing industry.  It brings out the question, just like Koy, of how long can all of this keep going on, how much more population can the earth hold, etc.  Good.  They (whoever they are) need to do an America only version of Samsara.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|I got this for my son's room. It is beautiful. The planets are smaller than what I thought they would be. It looks great in his room. Everyone gives us compliments on it. They like to see it light up and rotate.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I'm a long time fan of solitaire Mahjong.  This portable App makes a nice travel game.  I must admit that I find the choice of tile patterns limited, but otherwise this is a satisfying experience.
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|Thought about buying this since it's on sale, but I'm glad I didn't. Downloaded and installed the free version and it won't even open on my KF HD. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it still crashes before the game even starts. Too bad.<br /><br />Edit 10/30/13 - Forgetting that I had tried the free version with no success, I bought this app when it was on sale for $.99. So far the game works fine on my Kindle Fire HD, so either the problem was just with the free version or whatever the problem was has been fixed now. Haven't played too far into the game yet, but will update when I try it out a little more.
0062127241|5.0|I usually don't read autobiographies. This book was a Christmas gift. I have to say that this was a great book. Pete really opens up his life, I praise him for being so honest, open and personal. I have been a fan since Happy Jack. I saw them in Boston July of '71. Way to go Pete I have a lot of respect for you.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I slugged thru this book, but didnt like it Too repetiative  boring too hard to read definitely did not like
B00AK57N00|2.0|Another free download that I did not care for and removed from my kindle. I try to be more discriminating before downloading now.
0330517783|5.0|Really like these characters!! Book was fast moving...couldn't read it fast enough, but didn't want it to end!!!  Hour Game is next!!
0425252868|5.0|I read a lot of non-fiction books, but this was one of the best I've ever read!  It was so good that I ordered a signed copy and picked up two additional copies from our library for my two oldest boys (14 and 12-years old) to read as well.  The story is incredible and exceptionally well written.  The book reads like a novel and gives you a different perspective on the war that will surprise you.  I highly recommend.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Loving her debut album Lungs so much, the expectations I had for Florence's second outing were unhealthily high. But upon listening to Ceremonials I got goosebumps, and found myself grinning like an idiot.<br /><br />Oh, how I love these songs.<br /><br />Writing or doing work is a breeze with this on in the background, and I hate to act like this is an album worthy of being relegated to the background, except for the fact it's because I feel like I need it on for most of my day. And while the album is certainly a more somber set than Lungs, I can't help but love it just the same.<br /><br />Highly recommended, for anyone who loves good music.
0307341577|5.0|She has the ability to suck you in immediately!  I have lost sleep over this womans wonderful imagination.  Definitely a book I would want to read more than once.  just PLEASE!!!!!!  STOP MAKING ALL THE BOOKS I LOVE INTO MOVIES!!!!!!  THey are better in my imagination!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not a good plot  this author could have put this whol trilogy into one book half the lenght of first book
B00B29J0I6|4.0|Like most games I always want a little more detail in how it works. Maybe cause I'm kind of a game novice. Though I like it I am stuck for now on a level.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Best tower defense game (and one of the best tablet games) I've played. Animation is fantastic, huge enemy variety and fun assortment of towers to use. Enough levels to keep you entertained for hours. Replay value is there, too, as you want to go back and try levels at harder difficulties. Strategy becomes important as you try to figure out the right arrangement or towers to beat any particular level. Must buy!
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I agree with &quot;Donna G&quot;. Game has good storyline but items are hard to find and not enough zoom. I wanted to quit but since I paid for it I committed to finishing it and I was curious to see where the storyline was going. I enjoy G5 games but this one was disappointing.
0525478817|5.0|This is not a book about death, or dying. This is a book about life, and hope.<br /><br />The two teenage main characters are forced to deal with the affliction of terminal cancer, yet still manage to allow themselves the joy of falling in love.<br /><br />Truly a beautiful book, and one that made me genuinely cry tears of both happiness and sadness.
030758836X|5.0|I couldnt put this damn book down!  I was sad when it was over... that is certainly when I know I have a good book in hand.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|my oldest son got me hooked on this series....every episode was new and exciting.  i would highly advise against any kids watching it though as it's pretty graphic and gory even for regular TV standards.  it's addicting and i can't wait for the next series...but i'm not even going to bother with the TV version and sit patiently (not!) for the entire series to come out digitally so i can see it in it's entirety episode after episode without commercials.  ENJOY!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I was feeling skeptical about reading this book since I loved the movie so much that I didn't want to not enjoy the book, then feel displeased about the movie. I couldn't have been more wronged. As in most cases, the book is way better than the movie! While reading this book, I kept thinking  to myself: \\"why didn't they add this part in the movie!\\" This book is wonderfully amazing. Very much worth the read.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I have tried lots of trial periods and lots of free apps but this is by far the best and being free makes it in my opinion top dog, thank you to the programmers and all who have made this free app available
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Wanted to watch more at the end.  Wish there was a sequel to watch. I liked the whole thing. I would watch it again.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Have been playing for only a couple days and am already addicted.  Having a blast breeding dragons to see what I can make next.  Haven't spent a dime and very glad about that.  Recommended.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Good App but the site itself takes quite a few clicks to get some information. Local radar is a chore to get to, as is the hour by hour forecast. In the area I live in we get sudden storms and trying to get info quickly is not easy.
0307719774|5.0|This is the perfect gift for anyone. Answering one question a day is easy to do and it doesn't matter what day you start. The book has beautiful gold pages.
B00BBQXUYK|4.0|I didn't think I was like this movie but my daughter picked it out. how to say a really good movie two thumbs up
B001GST11O|3.0|Product was delivered on time and as ordered however I was not happy with the sound quality on the DVD's.<br />The volume levels fluctuate during the concert and in other sections of the DVD's. As this was not a cheap product, costing in excess of $50.00 Aus I was expecting the sound quality to be better than it is.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It does what it's supposed to do. My only complaint is with the Linux beta they have far to go to fix the bugs. It seems to work well with windows though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS EPIC! I LOVE IT CUZ U ALWAYS HAVE A GOAL! DESPICABLE ME IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE SO THIS GAME IS PERFECT FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES THE MOVIE!!&lt;3 THE MINIONS ARE SO ADORABLE&lt;3 &lt;3
B00447G2PM|5.0|We have never owned a 3D TV set before, so getting a 3D movie was the first on the list. We wanted to get something that can be shared with our friends and family members with less critical dialogues, so the full featured 3D movies were out for now. After a little bit of research, we found this title and its twin brother [[ASIN:B00447G2O8 Under the Sea]]. We went back and forth to choose only one, but they both had great reviews. Finally, we decided to order both, the single disk versions, and we couldn't be happier. The picture and 3D look awesome on either disk, and since they are very short, you can easily watch them back-to-back. We also did demo the disks on some occasions for our guests, and they all liked them so far.<br /><br />Deep Sea is narrated by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and as other reviewers have mentioned, they did a better job than Jim Carry's voice in Under the Sea. However, both my wife and I liked the colors of Under the Sea better. Under the Sea is more colorful and the \\"Potato Cod\\" scene is just amazing in 3D.<br /><br />I think both [[ASIN:B00447G2O8 Under the Sea]] and Deep Sea are great movies to have in your 3D collection. They are very short, only about 45 minutes each, so one may say price is a tad high on these titles; however, rest assured that you'll find more opportunities to watch and share these with your friends than the full length 3D movies. Besides, you can always get the single disk versions at a lower rate.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I was hoping for a lot of guns and graphic violence.  Plenty of both in this movie. Unlike the Stalone film, this movie was very true to its source material.  (This is based on a comic featured in a magazine called Heavy Metal.)  Karl Urban is a fantastic Judge Dredd.  Very gritty.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app it is amazing but the food is a little expensive and now I have to feed my fire dragon 100 food each time.
0765348276|5.0|I have been reading science fiction since I was nine years old, which makes it forty years more or less, and this book is one of the finest science fiction novels I have ever come across. The action is intense, the characters are believable, and the plot twists are highly entertaining. I bought this book for my husband, and he read it in one day and loved it too. I will be getting him the other three novels in this series for his birthday, and look forward very much to reading them myself. Thank you, Mr. Scalzi.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great!<br /><br />Rich characters and wonderful stories. A great history of the plague, too. I would definitely recommend the series to my friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is soo fun and addictive! A little hard sometimes but I love it! Very happy! But... the updates suck!!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Would be a 5 if they got rid of that contest stuff. It cheapens the web page. It does not belong here
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I saw part of this concert on PBS and that viewing prompted me to buy him.  I chose the DVD over the CD's because I also liked his band a lot and really enjoyed watching them play.<br /><br />I hadn't realized Mr. Cohen wrote so many songs that I know.  Even in his senior years he sings so intimately and is able to keep ypu in the palm of his hand..  I found him to be VERY entertaining.  Same for the backup sngers and the band.  I'm really glad I purchased this DVD.<br /><br />And I adored the hats.
B007N8RULO|5.0|as always...no matter the app..I'm addicted to Spider. love it.  i do wish the video ads would disappear or not start automatically...but all in all..best app on my kindle! trying. to get all the stamps ..just two more to go!
0316228532|1.0|This book is one of the worst novels I have ever read. It is tawdry, petty and banal, and if there was such a thing as an anti-tourist bureau for England, an agency charged with making you not ever want to go to a place, this could be their star publication. If you want to be depressed, read this novel. I skipped ahead and read the end, hoping for something better, but did not find it. Don't waste your money or your time on this book, it's just awful.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|i loved this book. I t kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end with plot twists and surprise. Not to mention how Rick Riordan managed to bring Greek mythology back to life. Can't wait to read the next book as soon as possible
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was too good of a deal to pass up. All three Dark Knight films on Blu-ray plus two discs of special features along with ultra violet copies of each film. All of this for $30 is the perfect package. If you're looking for limited edition action figures or other specials you won't get that with this set. But if you're looking for the these movies in HD you won't find a better deal.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my second time reading this book. It was as exciting this time as it was before. Suzanne Collins is a great writer. I enjoy all of her books.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love uno. The graphics n sound effects are awesome on my kindle fire HD. My only drawback is u run out of credits app fast here should be daily credits like other apps bingo for instance get so many credits on day one then he more u play the more daily credits u would receive. I love this game but would like too play longer. I have bought the full version of the other uno game but thru Google play wen I had a regular tab now that I have the kindle I can only do t h e free uno and there is no free full for kindle .<br /><br />If u love uno this is an awesome game.
B00C8985DU|5.0|I liked it very much.Beautiful package.Worth every cent.I would buy it again if I was crazy but I'm not , so I won't.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Absolutely the best production of this I have seen.  Amazing costumes. Great sets. Outstanding. Have recommended to all my friends.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is beautifully made and kept me entertained for days. It took a bit of getting use to at first, but after  playing for a while I got the hang of it. Nice game to play when you have some down time because its challenging but not too difficult.  I feel it was worth the two dollars.
B0058YPLA2|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife because she loves this show. I starting watching it with her and was surprised when I actually started enjoying the show. It has a pretty interesting, well written story and most of the actors do a pretty good job. Some of the special effects are less than spectacular but I wouldn't say that it takes away from the show at all. So I would actually recommend this if you're looking for a new show to watch that's a little different than your average sitcom.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This is a quick read that hits all major points of Resistance and overcoming it in your life. A sort of recap of The War of Art. Well worth a read!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I thought it was very good. Eva and Gideon are so in love and still learning to deal with how much. I do think there is a lot of stuff that still needs clarified and will be upset if another book doesn't come out. The end left me wanting to know more about the reporter, shrinks wife Anne, and much more. Please write another one!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a hard,beautiful way to end The Hunger Games series! Peers Gale, and Katniss are complex characters that represent people we know and people we don't wanna know!
B00BU18U82|4.0|I love this game but the only thing I didn't like is that you have to purchase the bigger tractor.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I wasn't expecting the second book to be better than the first. Though the plot was exceptionally better than the previous one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app with a lot of interaction and assistance when needed. Hoping to use it for my daughter to keep her busy during doctors appointments and such.
B008JFUPPI|1.0|So if you bury gold under an orange tree, Kevin Bacon will show up and try to sleep with your wife. All joking aside, \\"R.I.P.D.\\" is really unfulfilling, especially when you take into consideration that the comic book the film is based on is published by Dark Horse Comics; a comic book publisher that brought us \\"Hellboy,\\" \\"Sin City,\\" and \\"300.\\" \\"R.I.P.D.\\" is appallingly bad in nearly every way imaginable.<br /><br />There are actually a few factors to \\"R.I.P.D.\\" that aren't completely horrible. While the camera work is mostly very dizzying and obnoxious, the perspective is somewhat interesting during the opening raid sequence as it makes the viewer feel like they're part of this police team raiding a warehouse. The camera takes shelter behind walls, sticks its neck out to see if the coast is clear, and seems to wait for Nick's cue to proceed with caution. The way death is handled tries so hard to be a visual ecstasy, but fails. Nick wakes up to everything around him exploding, but the world around him is completely still. He walks around this frozen world stuck forever on pause before falling up into the sky; a technique that was done infinitely better in Adam Berg's Carousel Commercial. The first Dead-o transformation is kind of neat, but quickly loses its charm when you realize how cheap its computer animation seems.<br /><br />Everything else the film has to offer is equivalent to a pig rolling around in its own feces before doing a few laps in the gutter and finishing it off with a big helping of slop that was more than likely already digested by other pigs. Ryan Reynolds is his usual smart-mouthed self, but the poor guy always seems so restrained and held back when he's not in an R-rated film. Jeff Bridges is basically Colonel Sanders. He taps into his Rooster Cogburn accent, but his lines are atrocious as he talks about crumple zones and being smoked like a knockwurst. Why is a guy originally from the 1800s so obsessed with porn, anyway? When he's not searching for his hat, Jeff Bridges is spending his time overacting to a degree that would leave Nicolas Cage wondering just what in the hell Bridges was thinking.<br /><br />With jokes that feature Ryan Reynolds mocking charm bracelets and implying that Roy's last name sounds like an STD, Indian food being not only a big reveal for Dead-os but also an excuse to make characters barf and fart, and a cartwheeling fat Elvis that lasts so much longer than he really should, you can't shake the fact that \\"R.I.P.D.\\" features some of the most juvenile humor of any film in 2013. Combine that with the $130 million budget and cheap looking effects and you have a film that's all bloated eye candy and no substance.<br /><br />At one point, Roy reveals that the eye sockets of his original carcass were molested by a coyote's genitals to which Nick replies that he hoped the coyote got to both of them. Coyote molestation to the eyes for 96 minutes straight sounds less painful and like an absolute treat after viewing \\"R.I.P.D.\\" When Jeff Bridges being thrown under a bus is the best thing a film has to offer, that's when you know that that paved cinematic road ahead of you is going to be unreasonably rough.for his hat, Jeff Bridges is spending his time overacting to a degree that would leave Nicolas Cage wondering just what in the hell Bridges was thinking.<br /><br />With jokes that feature Ryan Reynolds mocking charm bracelets and implying that Roy's last name sounds like an STD, Indian food being not only a big reveal for Dead-os but also an excuse to make characters barf and fart, and a cartwheeling fat Elvis that lasts so much longer than he really should, you can't shake the fact that \\"R.I.P.D.\\" features some of the most juvenile humor of any film in 2013.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I have read four Harry Hole books and this one is as good as all the others. I have a special place in my heart for Harry.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Though it's slower to update than the iPhone, it's still incredibly fun.  The  movie is incorporated making it just as funny.  My husband, daughter and neighbor all have fun challenging every one.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I have just finished this particular installment in the series and am wondering if Martin has some sort of deep-seated hatred towards women. I find the whole of the book to be very interesting and fluidly written, albeit a tad longer than necessary, but I'm growing weary of the references to rape and objectification of women overall. I am no activist and I understand that this was written to reflect a different era than which we live in, but it feels as if Martin goes out of his way to insert some quip about defiling women or using them as some sort of glory hole. That particular subject matter sort of detracts from the overall issue at hand (depending on the PoV being used at the time), even if it's merely one reference to the matters I've discussed. Thankfully, Martin doesn't go full boar and give us a play by play of the sins committed against the women of the land/country/whatever the heck he is trying to whip up.<br />I will note that I am a bit confused as to whether this series is meant to be 'fantasy' or 'fiction'. There's mention of Dragons and the 'Others' and some sort of wolf-changeling action going on via dreams, but so far it all seems to fall flat and this guy is no Tolkien. If you're planning to read this series, don't expect to be swept away on rainbow-farting unicorns - keep looking. But as a pure historical fiction piece, it does holds its own.<br />Aside from that marginal inconvenience, I find the series so far to be engaging enough. I did purchase the third installment, as a lot of the characters have a certain intrigue to them. With very few exceptions, I tend to follow through with a series once I have started reading it......sexual misfortunes and all :(.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love this game but I don't like when you play the ball on game and you have to waste money to get the better ponies. But good game anyways.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm enjoying The challenge.  This game is lots of fun for this kid at heart. Played like subway surfer with some interesting twists.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this in a day...so glad I did!  I wanted to live this book before watching the movie..well, because you can't live a movie...not like the experience of reading it's story.  Pat is so troubled and I wanted the love of his life to come back to him..he tried so hard, it was heart-wrenching.  I cried!  Can't wait to see the movie..even though, I'm sure it won't do this brilliant book justice..but, it stars Bradley Cooper so it will be worth it:)
B00C061I3K|5.0|its great  its good  i<br />love it  the sound is fantatic makes my sterio  rock and roll  works well in my chevy truck also
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!! I don  have anything else to say so, Apple's candy popcorn cotton candy cereal ice cream
0884271153|5.0|I am really enjoying the where in which the book is written to allow you to think about the situations you get involved with on a day to date basis and to influence you to think in a difference way or approach to situations.  This allows you to grow as a person and develop your own unique way of dealing with situations  - Sharon-Lee
B000IU3XTW|4.0|Still good but not quite what I was expecting.<br />A must have for the dave grohl or foo fighters collection.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|GREAT!  It takes me back to the days when vinyl was the way we listened to music. Nice package too.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Abba was a tremendous singing group, one that began on the European scene and finally hit the American shores with an instant hit called &#34;Waterloo&#34; which put them on the top of the charts for years.  The talent between the writing of the lyrics of Benny and Bjorn along with the sensational vioces of Agnetha and Anni-Frid.<br /><br />Now at 62 her voice still has the clarity and range it was known for.  It is nice to welcome her back.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Good fun visuals, story and character advancement. You don't have to be a gamer to enjoy this RPG, but if you are it's deep enough to be enjoyable!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Just because you CAN add useless bells and whistles does not mean you SHOULD!  I hate the July upgrade(?)  By comparison Accuweather's or Weather  Bug' s  Kindle Fire HD apps are much better options.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is awesome if I am bored and can't think of anything to do I just get on here and find whatever..... this will be the new Facebook before you now it.:)
B0000CAXID|5.0|This will go down as one of the top 20 albums of the past 25 years. There is not a bad song on it.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Cheese is good, girls are impossible to understand, siblings are annoying, people are crazy, high school sucks, life is a rollercoaster, autocorrect can kiss my flabby behind, and now the rating popup will stop bugging me.
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|Anything with John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara is great to watch.  Both personalities are from the old school of acting not like the hit and miss actors of today.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Shuttle has impressed me since I bought my first case from them back in 2008. Small footprint, well equipped and super quiet. I love this box.
B005UG542S|4.0|Still a great movie and over the top brilliant over all. I so loved watching the characters grow older. Amazing mind.
B00CMYRSQG|4.0|August Burns Red has always been an impressive band that has tried new styles each album. Their performances are spectacular on the live stage as well. If you're an ABR fan, you'll enjoy R&R!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Another Will Robie story from David Baldacci; but pretty decent reading as usual.  I liked the sequence of events and how Baldacci kept the reader focused on the main characters.  He has a talent for integrating the the new players while aiming the reader towards the finale.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Very good, enjoyable, old-timey, action movie with no rules and no borders. Loved to see action heroes I grew up with still kicking it the old way.
B004GCK6XY|5.0|Am in the process of replacing old VHS tabes with Blu-Ray.  Notting Hill has always been one of my favorites to watch and enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game :) it's loads of fun. I can play for hours and hours.<br />Yes, hours after hours. I can't wait till I get home from work to play.
0345528581|5.0|The ideas in this book are different from what is usually seen as conventional wisdom, but I think he's right on.
B008JFUP0I|3.0|Torredo jumping out of a speeding car to catch Letty and land on a car- childish. Hobbs jumps from a speeding car several feet down to land on another speeding car. You could see he was being lowered with strings. The action was too unreal. Knocked the wind out of everything. That's why I like superhero movies.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love this series.  The plots are complicated and require some thinking and the chemistry between stars is outstanding. Thanks!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Not my first choice but once i started to read couldn't let go of it......Very interesting the twist in the story...
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Will eventually be recognized as one of the truly great features of our time.  The acting involved was above question.
0425263924|5.0|I love all the Crossfires so far!! I would recommend this to anyone who liked Fifty Shades. Also to anyone who just likes a major love story!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Really love this game play all the time. Graphics are great and colorful. Tile set selections are awesome. Would recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|The first six chapters of this book I found to be amusing which kept me reading. But the remainder of the book I found to be extremely repugnant. NOT my thing at all. If you enjoy reading about men beating women to a pulp to get their rocks off, then you will enjoy this book. Grey is a sadistic monster. This book does not live up to all the hype. I'll keep my self-respect and someone else can have these books. I will not be reading the other two 'oh my'.  My True Rating:  -5<br /><br />Some bully has gone through my reviews and clicked that they were not helpful. My reviews are truthful and they are my opinion. I will not back down to bullies.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Fantastic show no complaints on the quality of the writing or acting. Highly recommend to anyone even those who don't like fantasy/harry potter type work
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Loved this movie. It held my interest through the whole movie, it was great. Steven Spielberg made a great movie in my opinion.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Everything Battlestar Galactica all in one Blu-ray package at this incredible price.  Its at least $100 off. or at least it was !
B004XISI4A|5.0|The first of two books running side by side in a time line, as explained by the author.<br />Read this one first to keep everything in order.<br />If you have read the series so far you will have an appreciation of the layout and background to each of the characters and they don't disappoint. The trick is to not become too attached to a character as they tend to be bumped off when you lest expect it. It does make the book interesting though.<br />I can recommend this series of books and can't wait to finish the series.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like it but you need Internet to play it and it takes a long time to load so I recommend not getting it unless you have a lot of patients.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Parasitic aliens that enter through the back of the neck, take control of the body and cause your eyes to glow??  Sounds sorta familiar.  In fact I had a hard time finding anything in this movie that wasn't a poorly executed rehash.  Unless you're a 12 year old girl I can't recommend this one to you.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Don't waste your time; one of the worst movies I've ever watched. No plot to speak of, or a weak one at best, difficult to follow anything in this movie for more than five minutes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This  game keeps you thinking. I LOVE IT! If you are a problem solver this game is definitely for you.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|What a weird character! You want to hate him but you can't stop feeling sorry for him! Glad they are more Henry books to keep it going.
B00204AA0O|5.0|This album has a great variety of slower and more upbeat tracks.  There isn't a dull moment.  It made my last car trip a lot more pleasant!  Any fan of Spektor will love this, and it's a great place for people newer to her material to start.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I bought this to be able to replace the battery on my father's GPS. It has everything that you need to take apart electronics (except the pry bars, but a small flt head will do the trick). The case looks really nice. The magnetic heads are very strong. It comes with a flexible extension shaft that double as a T-handle for added torque and a 1/4 inch adapter. The handle seems really strong, with little rubber grips and a free spinning top. The quality is superb. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone that loves to tinker with electronics.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The acting and lines were super.  All actors were casted well and did a great job of entertaining you with excitement and comedy...that can be tricky and they carry it off with aplomb.  Slightly politically biased as is most of the S___ that comes out of holly wood but not offensive to a conservative.  See it!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|My 2 year old loves the Angry Birds game!  She has found her own way of playing the game and she loves to make the touch screen move to try and find the birds.  She loves the noises the birds make and when I'm grocery shopping or at the mall, this game keeps her entertained.  I recommend this download.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I'm gonna try it because all your comments say great things about this app and they show a lot of proof that this great about this app
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Without knowing the story, any newcomer would be confused.  This isi not a movie per se; it is a collection of songs from scenes in a movie.  I recommend watching the Liam Neeson movie version first, then the musical.  Hugh Jackman failed miserably on &#34;Bring Him Home,&#34;  the signature song from the play.  I wouldn't have given this production any awards - or nominations.  Thank God for Russell Crowe.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and a great way to occupy your time when waiting for the kids.  Love it love it
0345529057|5.0|My daughter is fascinated! It came in perfect  conditions<br />Is good deal compare with the price on the store by book.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|I just spent $1.99 and then $3.99 to unlock the whole game and remove ads but it's only partially unlocked and the ads are still there. I'm very upset.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I didn't have a problem downloading this beautiful app but I could never get it to work.  It always stopped in the middle of my daughter listening to the story being read to her.  I have uninstalled it for now but the app itself has gorgeous colors!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'm a huge Supernatural fan and collect all the season series even though I watch their show, the guys are awesome.
B002E2M3LG|5.0|&#34;Innuendo&#34; is, in my opinion, by far, the best Queen album.  I have loved it on Cassette and CD; it sounds even better on vinyl.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Have really enjoyed both IRONMAN movies.Can't think of any other actor who could bring the character to life better than Robert Downey, Jr. Really looking forward to seeing third installment as well as the second & third installments of the Avenger movie series. It's refreshing to find movies suitable for children to watch and enjoy but one that will also entertain adult viewers. Great movie night fun!
B007N8RULO|4.0|When I downloaded this &#34;FREE&#34; game onto the Kindle I did not realize that ADs or commercials would pop up after playing the game.  Had I known this, I might have looked at other alternatives.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|never closes it self and I can have the exacte persentage of my battery any time and this app warns me when I only have 15% left
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app is easy to use. Locations are easy to add and select. Great addition for the kindle fire hd.
0812548094|3.0|The plot keeps bolting along and the characters are interesting.  I'm hoping for a less predictable Richard in the next book.  I did like the action/plot in this book, but Goodkind's writing is deplorable at times. While some of the concepts are refreshingly new, I feel as if much is borrowed from WOT and LOTR, and thinly veiled as such.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you like the movies, you have to have this. Lots of extras, on a couple of BD's, in this set too!
B0083Z614S|5.0|When I started this book I quite not expected how much I would like it. It is a lovely story, but with such a powerful depth about human nature and feelings, and how we can improve ourselves. Honestly, it is a wonderful read.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Had the 30 days of Prime free, I was vacationing at a condo near Palm Beach, FL on the ocean.  Watched it on the Kindle Fire.
0143119680|5.0|A well written and captivating story. I couldn't put it down once I started it. The characters and the settings were wonderfully developed. I really haven't read a book this entertaining in quite a while and I read a lot.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I installed these with a three cell LED maglight in every room.  Installed into the garage and installed in my car.  Keeps the light right where it should be and allows quick retrieval when needed.  Easy to install and does the job.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Made an easy connection to my Kindle Fire and of course worked. They were made for each other. Very slim and easy to connect.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game is not letting me tilt!!!!!! I think I should delete it, Don't get it if you don't want to be ashamed
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book provided me with a week of entertainment and I'd wager, given the opportunity, this book could do the same for anyone.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My 5 year old loved this movie and so did I!  It was well made and great art! Kept her interested!
B004B8DH98|5.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />If you can not appreciate slow films, this one may not be for you. This will certainly make you appreciate the true passion behind film aspects and the power of silence. I had seen this 3 or 4 times before buying it. It is one one of my all time favorite George Clooney films. There is very little speaking in this film, not many characters, and it ALMOST seems to drag on with a few things. I say almost, because it is necessary, for the films emotion, to draw out the way it does. You get to see so much emotion behind the things going on with the main character and what he is going through trying to get out of the business. I am rather disappointed that he dies in the end. I was rooting for him to get out and have a good life with his love interest. Plus, that would leave the door open for a sequel. Never the less, it is a truly BRILLIANT film. It is a masterpiece in its own right!
B0088X7YU0|4.0|I dont see the characters as blank visually.  But I do agree that their development is shallow.  The big complaint is they still cannot seem to get the suits to match the books description!  (insert explicative)
B009KS4XRO|2.0|you have to fight for credits,  cards are now over priced.  and they randomly drop into your account and steal credits and items won.
0802473156|5.0|This book was just as described on Amazon.  I think everyone (single or married) should have this book in their collection.  It is a very good communication tool.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Sometimes free versions of games have very limited access to new levels. This one has 200! That has been plenty for me, and I play every night to unwind.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|The movie is well done -- the sets, the acting, the story.  For me, however, I just found it too much.  I hate watching cruelty -- so I actually did not finish watching the movie -- I had had enough about half way through.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|I bought this for my grandson who loves the book.  He's three and won't stop playing with this app.  He is into counting right now and loves to count along with the game and show us all that he was right when he completes a page correctly.  There's no caterpillar but my grandson hasn't even asked for him yet.  He just knows, from the pictures and the food items that it is the hungry caterpillar.  The fact that there is no caterpillar in this app hasn't kept him from playing with it.<br /><br />I can see him playing this for a while.  It has different levels so he will grow into it slowly.  I'm not one to pay for apps as I usually look for the free apps or a free for the day app but this one, in my opinion, was worth the 299 coins I used to buy it.
B00CMB8MXC|1.0|The first Despicable Me soundtrack was amazing.  This one is more of a score than a soundtrack.  You will be better off buying the single to Cee-Lo's &#34;Scream&#34; and Pharrell's &#34;Happy&#34; songs.  It is so bad that two tracks from the first album were rehashed completely.  Not remixed just copied in their entirety.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Game is ok. Hidden object puzzles are intricate enough but easy to see and find on the Kindle. You have to go back through the puzzles a second time to get additional necessary items.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game. I play it all the time. Only bad thing is it is very addicting! Lol! I highly recommend.
1401324649|3.0|Having read the first 60 or so pages, I put the book down with the intention to pass on this one. I couldn't care less about the old people's home centenary escapee and didn't find the desperately-trying-to-be-funny style amusing at all. After reading another book, however, I decided to give the Allan character another chance. It was at about the time in the book when present-day chapters started to alternate with the account of Allan's younger life. And those chapters I liked a lot better, finding it actually quite annoying to have to return to his motley crew's road trip in the Sweden of 2005.<br /><br />Being one hundred years old, Allan Karlsson's life spans the entire 20th century, with its major military conflicts and changing political regimes. He travels the globe, virtually drifting where the wind takes him, nonchalantly meeting all the great political leaders by chance. He happens to have influenced some world events from behind the scenes without actually taking any notice of, or credit for, it. Allan's untroubled attitude is perfectly in line with the very light, entertaining tone of the narrative. But in addition to making me smile every now and then, there's something else that the book gave me. The lesson that I'd like to keep in mind is: Don't take life or yourself too seriously. And don't worry too much because \\"things are what they are, and whatever will be, will be.\\"
630463949X|2.0|This is letterbox, not widescreen.  This looks 480i.  Very disappointed especially since I just saw them last month in Tampa Bay live.  I've loved Fleetwood Mac since I first heard Rhiannon.  So yes, I am a big fan and the sound was great but the video is poor.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app looks so real. It's like they took pictures and edited them. Amazing graphics. Entering and winning competitions is easy. Totally get this game.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock was excellent when I watched on PBS and now it's even better when I can watch all three episodes back to back without waiting.  I can get my Benedict Cumberbatch fix while waiting until NEXT YEAR for season 3.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Plays just like the one. On the. Computer. I can listen to my music while playing the game. The only downside purchasing the game did not unlock everything(.
B00AEFY6ZQ|3.0|I bought this copy of Hatari because it looked like it was remastered sound wise because in the Language section under Product Details it stated English (Dolby Digital 5.1).  Well it's not,  still sounds like mono no sound out of rear speakers or separation in front speakers.  I needed the copy of Hatari anyway, just wish they could up the remastering to sound also.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|could not open app... just kept saying loading and then would go back to home page. I deleted it after a day of never using it.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire hd based on some positive rating. With in 5 minutes it locked up twice. From what I saw it looked like a colorful yet dull game. I wouldn't recommend this to play on a kindle unless you are insanely bored.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Played it straight through on a road trip. Glad I never had to put it down. It's got a pretty good story line. Part two is going to be great.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I cannot understand why this app was changed. It used to be extremely easy to use, but now is an absolute mess.<br /><br />I hate having to navigate around the ads and incentives now. The forecast tool is clunky and very finicky.<br /><br />Weather channel, someone sold you on what an app &quot;should be&quot;, but you were clearly mislead.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I personally think this is the best one in the franchise because it has more creative levels. The abilities and costumes of the birds are awesome and each star wars character chosen for the birds are perfect, I  have played and owned every other<br />one in this franchise and so far, this is the best!
B009AMANBA|5.0|The story is enthralling, and Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln is outstanding.<br />Following the story is mesmerizing, since we know it closely follows what actually happened.<br />Hats of to the Producer and Director also!!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book give a well detailed story about the war in Iraq, I like that we get to see his personal struggles especially with his marriage. Overall  a well written story.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Every character is a favorite, every storyline just as interesting as the one before. I'm trying to force myself to remember as much as possible, because I know it's the smallest of details that matter. Just when I start to think I have figured something out, or know what will happen I am all to quickly reminded of Yigrette's famous words, &#34;You know nothing, Jon Snow.&#34; And I don't either. Martin is becoming a new favorite of mine.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and challenging. I have sat down and played this for hours. Great game buy it!
B006JPS1OM|4.0|This is a good game with great graphics! I felt like a detective. The story is a bit silly, but fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it, it keeps you busy and my younger siblings love it as well. Also the horses are very pretty.
B002ZG999U|4.0|A great action flick with many action movie stars coming together. A good addition to your movie library for sure.
B00AEUU4LQ|3.0|I eagerly anticipated reading this books for months before I finally got to read it.  I loved the previous two and hoped for an equally engaging tale this time.<br /><br />The book started out well.  THere was mystery, drama, tragedy and intrigue which captivated me right form the first pages.  As I read on though I found myself very confused, wondering if I'd skipped parts.  The story jumps around in time and place from one character to another without any real flow.  THere are detailed backstories of characters that never amount to anything.  There are connections between many of the characters but some characters have left me wondering why they were included.  Some of the stories, though heartbreaking seemed out of place and irrelevant.<br /><br />This story spans over 75 years, 3 continents and several characters.  It was difficult to follow and by the end I actually found myself saying, \\"Who cares?\\"<br /><br />I am glad to have finished the book but am sorely disappointed not have formed any attachment to the charecters.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Can not rave enough, I just love this show! This season is even better than the first 3! I even love the price that I paid for this season!
B008JFUP0I|5.0|This is the best of all the movies in my opinion! This is definitely worth watching.<br /><br />All of the actors do a great job in this film.
B00457WZEI|5.0|How does anyone define love? In this book, there are many definitions. Love, for animals, humans or otherwise, is to be cherished.
B002AT4K9G|4.0|A great action flick with many over the top scenes when it comes to the action but still a good addition to your movie library for sure.

1451648537|3.0|Okay, I like the subject matter even though I'm not a big Mac-ecosystem guy (no Macs but heavy iTunes/iPhone user) and I was glad that this book gives us a lot of perspective and hopefully accurate history of how things went down.<br />What I don't like is that I'm not sure it's the most pleasing style of narration but then again, maybe the bar for biographies is not all that high? I don't think I'm the best judge since I'm not a huge bio connoisseur but I think from a recommendation point of view, I'm giving this thing a big fat neutral - Switzerland all the way.<br />I still believe our world would be much cooler and hopefully better if Jobs was still around leading his team to come up with brilliant stuff (and make no mistake, it's his TEAM that did all the heavy lifting) and it's still kind of surreal to not have this icon around while we still have Gates, Buffet and the like. But Jobs was so different and it's a bummer that the dude didn't turn to traditional western medicine and technology sooner.<br />The flipside is that his legacy benefits a lot like Kennedy and other died-too-soon icons in that we only caught his most recent ascent and not the inevitable crash.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Funny and makes you think!! Absolutely loved it and can't wait to watch the next season. Anyone interested in the endless possibilities of the universe will enjoy.

B008ALAHA4|3.0|I bought a (gently used) 27\\" Thunderbolt display and a 15\\" Macbook Pro Retina last summer.  I needed this converter to connect the two (the Thunderbolt display had the older style power connector for connecting to the older MacBook Pros and Macbook Airs).  It's a huge convenience to be able to use the power supplied from the Thunderbolt display to connect to and charge the Macbook -- one less plug and I can keep the power adapter that came with the Macbook in my travel bag.  Anyway for a month or two it worked great.  But then I noticed that, while the Macbook was getting power, the battery was not getting charged.  I looked into this for months and the only real answers I got were people speculating that the Thunderbolt didn't supply enough power for the MBP Retina.  Or that the power cables coming out of the Thunderbolt display would have to be replaced.  I put this off because I didn't want to deal with it (and went back to using the original MBP adapter) and then the Thunderbolt Display lapsed out of warranty.  I kept trying to use the Thunderbolt display's power connector, just to see if it would magically start working again, and it just got worse - eventually supplying NO power to the MBP.  Then on one of the Apple Support forums I read a post about someone with the same problem -- and she had solved it by replacing the converter.  I was skeptical -- could this seemingly simple, $9.99 converter be the cause of the problem?  I ordered a new one from Amazon three days ago and -- BOOM -- problem solved.  The MBP is now getting full power from the Thunderbolt display.  So I'm a little annoyed by the quality control, and that I had to buy the thing twice to get a working one, but then again $9.99 is a lot less than a costly Thunderbolt Display repair.  Anyway, in case anyone else is having a similar problem, I thought I'd post my resolution here.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Disappointing in relationship to the two prior novels. Too many extraneous story lines; difficult to keep track of characters and their relationships to each other.
0316010669|2.0|Man, I really was starting to like this author after \\"Tipping Point\\" and his column in \\"New Yorker\\" but this book is a stinker. I might not be giving it a fair shot since I actually stopped reading it so if there's a big fat payoff near the end, I'm not going to experience that for a long time and even then, will I have remembered most of anything from my first time trying to suck it up and read this book? Doubtful.<br />Seriously, I'm about 60% through this thing and it feels like a slog for sure.<br />I'll still keep an open mind about future efforts from this dude but I'm not going to sing praises for this one.

B009RH9FR6|5.0|After three attempts, I finally got it right! Or, shall I say, this product is the ideal case and Marware got it perfect. I ordered the Amazon standard fare case (junk--I will be returning), the Belkin (a tad better; however, lacking in the padding and magnetic closure system--I will be returning this as well).<br /><br />Everything about this Marware \\"Axis\\" case typifies the finest. The luxurious feel of the real leather (as opposed to faux), the 180 degree rotating platform for ergonomic positioning; the interior hand grip, to the microfelt interior. And, it incorporates minimal fumbliness to turn on and off the unit having an integrated magnet to auto switch the unit on or off.<br /><br />I cannot understand the complaints about \\"bulkiness\\" when the inherent padding protects the device when the fortuitous drop does occur. You will be thankful for the padding.<br /><br />Dismiss the other perceived gripes about phantom shortcomings and petty negatives--it is that forlorn phenomena of human nature when any forum is produced that the crybabies will wail. Conversely, I laugh when some persons desire pen holders, card holders, straps, zippers--come on! Get a portfolio!<br /><br />No defects with this case. Quality through and through.<br /><br />I ordered the black case and it is very luxurious and svelte.<br /><br />Marware you have earned my business--I will take a closer look at your other products as well. This is what quality does--it beckons recognition and approbation.

B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Disclaimer: I was given a copy of Time Killer in return for an honest review.<br /><br />Have you ever wasted anyone's time?  Maybe taken too much time at the supermarket checkout while you fumble through a stack of coupons?  Ever fished through the cup holders in your car for loose change in the drive thru while a line of cars waits impatiently behind you?<br /><br />Someone is fed up with having his time wasted and he's putting a stop to it.  Detective Max Larkin and his partner Jesse Fairlane are doing all they can to put a stop to him.  Time Killer moves quickly as the two detectives deal with their own personal issues while trying to find the serial killer who is terrorizing the city.<br /><br />There are a number of errors in the text that most likely could have been caught by a proofreader.  And some of the dialog seems forced and unrealistic.  But none of these issues should prevent the reader from enjoying what I hope is just the first in a series of thrillers by Todd Thiede.
1400067820|4.0|Many of the reviewers of Antifragile focus on the implications of Taleb's book for both personal investments and for building improving the resilience of the national or world economy.  There are certainly a lot of interesting ideas on how to improving financial and economic strength. For example, Taleb's concept of \\"asymmetric optionality\\" has a lot of merit.  An individual or economy can gain from volatility by diversifying in a large number of \\"bets\\" that have little downside or obligation, but a very large upside.  This may sound as unreal as a unicorn, but Taleb gives lots of real examples of this.<br /><br />What most of the reviewers have overlooked are the lessons of Antifragile for personal health and longevity.  The book has an excellent discussion of the concept of hormesis -- the biological principle by which low-dose stressors cause living organisms to become stronger.  The classic example is weightlifting to induce muscular hypertrophy and increases in bone density.  But Taleb takes the concept a lot further.  Of particular interest is Taleb's idea of \\"via negativa\\" - how to get healthy by eliminating things from your diet (like modern fruits) or periodic fasting, and avoiding modern innovations like air conditioning, antibiotics, anti-depressants, disinfectants and sunscreen.  He has a lengthy critique of interventional medicine, which focuses on short term gains while ignoring longer term harms.  He points out how all the legal and institutional incentives tend to favor interventionism, rather than exploiting our intrinsic antifragility to gain strength and health.<br /><br />A recent book review at [...] explores these health-promoting implications of antifragility in a lot of depth.

B005SZADQS|1.0|I saw the pilot episode to see what all the praise was about. I didn't really like it. It would be a good horror show without all the bad language and sexual conduct.<br />The images weren't scary at all, I was expecting to shut my eyes in horror. It is more like a mystery than a horror show. I won't be watching the rest of the seasons.
B003B02O0U|4.0|A few years ago John Grisham wrote a novel The Pelican Brief.  I recently reread it! Is it still as good as before?<br />Synopsis:<br />Darby is in her second year of Law School at Tulane University.  She is having an affair with her professor Callahan.  Life could not get any better!  Then one day Justices Rosenberg and Jenson are murdered.  Darby hears about the murders and thinks she can figure out who did it.  Classes are skipped hours are spent figuring out a theory on who did it.  One day Callahan takes a look at the brief after Darby dismisses her theory.  He offers to show her brief to a friend of his in D.C. who works with the FBI.  Little did they know the chain reaction of events that would happen because of this brief?  People start dying in order to protect the interests of one wealthy client of White and Blazevich.  Who can Darby rely on once these events start occurring?<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I think that The Pelican Brief will have a permanent place on my bookshelf.  I don't know if it is the strong female lead character of Darby Shaw.  Don't get me wrong the other characters are great too!<br /><br />To write a good thriller there must be detail.  It helps us understand the action later in the story.  There are times when I want to say okay this great but why is this important!  Then it is revealed later in the story.  There were some slow spots in The Pelican Brief but still a great story.

1609613937|5.0|I am a McDougall fan so am really biased when it comes to his approach to diet and nutrition.  Each of his books has further refined and presented this approach making it more doable and understandable.  Although I am not a total convert, I would like to be.  This addition to the McDougall library provides more of the same and then some.  It was an encouraging offering on my plate!

B0064X7FVE|1.0|The Weather Channel July 2013 App UPDATE. NOT A HAPPY MORNING the day I routinely opened my Kindle Fire to check my weather. Cartoonish circles for the forecast?!! NO SIGN  OF EVERYTHING I LIKED?!! I absolutely swore by & sang the praises of the old app. Loved the Traffic Map option, for example. The App was was fun & a joy to use several times every day. It was my very first app when  I got my Kindle. I agree with the other reviewer the ads weren't a problem. My issue now:  ALL of it. It is NOT the quality content I've been used to for so long. I am so disappointed. So glad I didn't install on my cell or any other device!! I truly hate to delete this app. I will wait another month to see if the powers that be notice the poor quality & UNHAPPY USER FEEDBACK. I may be an optimist to hope The Weather Channel will bring back the BETTER format & options. (I do not have a huge number of apps. I choose, probably, too carefully.)
0785165975|4.0|Awesome comic of a little girl that can kick bad-ass asses. Mark Millar and JRJR are the best!! More violence than Kick ass 1
B009AMAJVO|4.0|Victor is an enforcer is Alphonse's little mob/real estate group.  Victor is also Laslo, a victim of Alphonse's violence.  Laslo's daughter was killed by a stray bullet, his wife murdered when they decided to serve as witnesses.  Laslo himself is left for dead, but seeks his revenge by slowly murdering members of Alphonse's crew.  His plan is going perfectly...until the neighbor across the way, Beatrice, sees something she shouldn't.  Except Beatrice doesn't go to the police; wounded in a car crash, she blackmails Victor/Laslo into killing the man who ruined her life.  Meanwhile, Alphonse is slowly putting the pieces (literally) together, and all the clocks are ticking towards the inevitable showdown.<br /><br />For its first two-thirds, DEAD MAN DOWN is an interesting film.  It starts off with a great shootout, and there are other bursts of action throughout that are well-timed, well-shot, and truly engaging.  The violence is quick and brutal; there's a particular scene, little over halfway through, that isn't altogether graphic, but really gets under your skin.  That's what DEAD MAN seems to be about, at first--burrowing under there.  You go in expecting a typical revenge/gangster flick, and instead you find yourself in the messed up world of director Niels Arden Oplev, who gave us the original THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO film.  Colin Farrell's brooding Victor/Laslo is an interesting character, at moments totally sympathetic, other times completely repugnant.  The same goes for Noomi Rapace's Beatrice, who oddly comes off as the least interesting of the pair; this is through no fault of the actress, who as always is nearly flawless, and captures some truly poignant moments with merely a look.  Terence Howard, as Alphonse, is the epitome of despicable cool.  Kudos go to supporting actors Dominic Cooper, as a fellow henchman with ambitions, and F. Murray Abraham as Laslo's confidant.  And pay close attention to Armand Assante, who continues a quasi-late career comeback in his role as the aging gangster; in his sole scene, he conveys a nice tone of subdued rage, making one wish he had a greater role.<br /><br />The film slowly falls apart in its third act, coincidentally as Victor/Laslo's plan begins to crumble.  The final shootout is exhilarating in many aspects, but begins shallowly and ends on an empty note.  Honestly, and I hate to say it because Rapace does such an amazing job with what she's given, but the Beatrice character is almost obsolete; yes, Rapace and Farrell have an interesting chemistry which is fun to watch, but her portion of the film weighs the plot down, ultimately becoming the \\"damsel in distress\\" role that clearly both Beatrice and Rapace are better than.  DEAD MAN DOWN ultimately ends up undermining many of its own ambitions...and yet, it's definitely worth a watch or two, as it features some fine performances, some great action scenes, and some truly unsettling, morally ambiguous questions that are as relevant today as they ever have been.  Plus, for the most part, it's just a well-made film.omeback in his role as the aging gangster; in his sole scene, he conveys a nice tone of subdued rage, making one wish he had a greater role.<br /><br />The film slowly falls apart in its third act, coincidentally as Victor/Laslo's plan begins to crumble.

B00DMK6WN4|5.0|UPDATE 11/4/13: Blu-ray details review.<br /><br />QUALITY: Unsurprisingly, the video quality is stunning. Little else needs to be said about the transfer. It's flawless.<br /><br />EXTRAS: There are a TON of extras!<br /><br />If you like the behind-the-scenes process of filmmaking, the extras here are about as extensive as I've seen before. Not only do the shorts give a background of life on Pixar's campus (Campus Life), but plenty of dedication to each aspect of making the film. Of course, there's also some deleted scenes.<br /><br />What's nice about the scenes is that director Dan Scalon talks you through the scene in detail and why it was cut. They are of course unfinished, but still interesting to see what could have been part of the movie.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's the layout of the bonus features menu. Despite the features being on a blu-ray disc, the menu does not operate like a blu-ray menu. Typically, you're able to operate within the menu while the movie (or features) are playing on screen. Instead, you need to return to the menu screen to select the next option. It's a small caveat, but there we go.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW. DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM.<br /><br />If you don't care about the end being discussed, then by all means read on...<br /><br />My wife and I saw Monsters University and both loved it. Many of the Top Critics on Rotten Tomatoes however, seemed to miss the point of the film entirely.<br /><br />\\"This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets.\\" - Richard Roeper<br /><br />\\"[It] conforms to [Pixar's] apparent drift toward the average, with toy sales taking priority over originality.\\" - Liam Lacey<br /><br />\\"Monsters University is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful.\\" - Steven Rae<br /><br />\\"Mostly memorable for being fine but forgettable.\\" - Betsy Sharkey<br /><br />Since 1995, Pixar has dominated computer animated filmmaking. They constantly win Academy Awards (9 nominations, 7 wins for Best Animated Feature) and are universally praised for their efforts by the critics. Nearly each Pixar movie has a handful of lessons or dominant themes it tries to teach and tell.<br /><br />  The Toy Story Trilogy (friendship, getting older)<br />  A Bug's Life (self-esteem, ingenuity, teamwork)<br />  Monster Inc (greed, pride)<br />  Finding Nemo (father-son relationship, growing up, letting go)<br />  The Incredibles (family values, honor)<br />  *Cars and Cars 2 (I'm pretty sure these are just about marketing toys)<br />  Ratatouille (friendship, trust, confidence)<br />  WALL-E (consumerism, environmentalism)<br />  Up (love, living life in the moment)<br />  Brave (family values, respect, love, mother-daughter relationship).<br /><br />However, after seeing MU and reading the critical reviews, I was shocked how many reviewers missed the point of the film and the important lessons Pixar chose to address in the film. You could even make the argument that the lessons in MU are more bold than any previous Pixar film. Which leads to why MU is ultimately about failure and why that's okay.<br /><br />Obviously, as this is a movie about college, there are your typical and inherent lessons for the characters (finding your place, growing up, building friendships), but the most important and surprising lesson is watching Mike Wazowski fail. This lesson is a particularly unique and groundbreaking approach for the age groups in Generation Y (Millennial) and Z. Generational scholar and author Ron Alsop argued that the Millennial generation is a group of \\"trophy kids\\", who were given rewards just for participating. I'm a Millennial and like many of my friends growing up, we all received gold stars on our homework, ribbons for events, etc. constantly rewarding us for just doing our job. You could also argue we've been constantly told that we could achieve anything we want if we just worked hard. We were told there was no way we could fail. This is the definitive issue that MU tackles head-on.<br /><br />From the age of little monster, Mike is enthralled with the career of being a scarer - the job that every monster dreams of. It's for the cream of the crop. Mike is told continually as a small monster that he's too small and not scary enough to succeed. It's only after he sneaks into a live door on the Monsters, Inc. scare floor that people believe he's capable of great things. He uses that moment to work hard and get into Monsters University to study at the School of Scaring.<br /><br />The main plot is the competitive nature between the hard-working Mike and the famous-last-name Sullivan. Their antagonistic rivalry drives the story until they are forced to work together to get back into the School of Scaring. Like all feel good movies, Mike and Sullivan ultimately save the day, win the Scare Games and are cheered and admired amongst everyone at the school. They defeat the oppressive Dean and defy expectations, the day is theirs! But it's right that that the writers (Robert L. Baird, Daniel Gerson, Dan Scanlon) drastically changes things.<br /><br />Sullivan admits to cheating to help his team of lovable losers win and save face for Mike who he believes isn't scary. When Mike finds out, he breaks into the door testing laboratory to prove to himself that he is indeed scary. However, he quickly learns that he does not in fact scare the kids in the cabin. Crushed, Mike goes to the nearby lake and wallows in self-pity. Everything he's dreamed about and worked for has been for naught - he's failed to be scary, what society tells them is the only thing monsters should be. In the end Mike accepts this and along with Sully works his way from the mailroom at Monsters Inc. to the scare floor where we find him and Sully in Monsters, Inc.<br /><br />While this journey from the mailroom to success supports the \\"work hard and you can accomplish anything\\" mentality of our generations, it also addresses the fact that Mike isn't ultimately meeting his initial goal. He acknowledges his failure and grows past that. No other examples come to mind of children movies in which a character or character fail and are okay with it, at least not in the end. This is what the critics missed. Pixar has chosen to tell a story about children (monsters) who grew up and realized that they cannot achieve their dreams, that their dreams are out of reach and totally unattainable. This bold lesson is actually a fantastic one for kids who watch this film.<br /><br />For some, it's been decades of being taught that it is okay to fail, but that with hard work you can still achieve those dreams. For many that's true, but for some it's just not feasible. MU has managed to tell a story that supports that second statement. Failing isn't bad and realizing that some dreams really are out of reach is also okay. The real lesson is to be comfortable with who you are, what you're truly capable of and utilizing your strengths to better yourself and your community. That's what Mike does, he becomes the coach and teacher. His knowledge of scaring helps Sullivan to eventual massive success. He helps the rest of Oozma Kappa reach their dreams.<br /><br />It's not a story about settling, it's a story about failing, learning from it and growing from the experience to make yourself and others better. It's a life lesson that we should share with this current and future generations. Yes you can reach your dreams with hard work, but if you can't, that's okay too.ust worked hard.

1452115567|5.0|I had been anxiously awaiting the release of this book because I have been a fan of Maddie even before she became the star she is now.  As a dog lover, I enjoy seeing Maddie's adventures.  I purchased this book sight-unseen and was not disappointed.  There are loads of pics to smile about.  If Theron Humphrey publishes another book in the future featuring this lovable girl, I will gladly purchase that one as well.
B00BFBBN3G|5.0|A great movie, I'm a Depardieu fan, so I enjoyed seeing Gerard in it. I ordered it for my friend who loves &#34;cats&#34; of all kinds. A good mystery that left me hanging at the end!

When I affirm something people and events come into my life to help facilitate what I need or want.  This book offers experiments that are fun, fascinating and really work, if you are a true believer and not a skeptic.
0880793589|5.0|These cards were purchased as based on a recommendation of a friend. I frankly, did not think much about it. Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />They are fantastic!! The information and questions are so thought provoking. Deep yet simple, they really shake up the norm, so to speak, getting you out of the rut of repetitive thinking.<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommended them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but every time I shut down my kindle it downloads the game again and I lose all my progress. :(. But it is a very fun game!! Sometimes I think some of the stuff is overpriced but that is just my opinion.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A pacy, witty comedy of errors about an adventurous life, and a bunch of crazy wonderful characters. A must read.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|If you are looking for a camping or emergency purpose lantern, then this one offers the biggest bang for the buck. Number1 reason, it runs on 3 D batteries! I ran mine for a week (night time hours only), and it hasn't lost any brightness, on the same set of economy alkaline batteries. It has three settings, bright, brighter, and flashing. It also has a small locator strobe which flashes continuously for easy location in the dark. This feature uses so little current that it should last for months if not years.<br />I purchased the Lighting Ever LED Lantern for use during our occasional storm caused  power outages, when we need to hook up our generator. It also has a hook on the bottom for hanging upside down (useful in a tent or under the hood of a car).<br />For less than $20.00, this is far and away the best lantern I have ever seen or owned.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Though not really an acoustic guitar fan, Joe B lights it up with an outstanding performance. He has really risen to the top and this album is a reflection of it. I really like the material from the Dust Bowl album in particular.<br /><br />Very creative.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Mama was a great movie with very shocking moment, great visual effects and excellent story line. Overall Great movie and I would and have recommended to anyone.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I loved this movie however it may be too subtle and sophisticated for children. If you liked \\"over the hedge\\" and \\"Napoleon dynamite\\" you will love this film.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love playing magic and its cheaper because for all the cards you have to buy in real life costs so much more than ten dollars. You guys should also make this game available on iPhone and iPod its so much fun my friend wanted to get the full version but couldn't find it. I will probably get the full version tomorrow! Great work guys/girls!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome, free, fun, cool, and if you buy it, you are NOT wasting your time! It is really fun. You can jump, roll, anything! You can get/buy new people! It is so fun! You really should get it! Hope you liked my review!
B00CZ1HELA|4.0|Pleasant way to pass the time tapping the screen until every piece is connected at both ends. Neither particularly hard or easy. Less brain power than crosswords, more tapping than Singing in the Rain.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|For the most part, I enjoyed this movie; the plot is solid, the acting superb, and the special effects and sound are top-notch. However, this film franchise is walking a precarious line in terms of being overindulgent in action and violence, which doesn't adhere to Roddenberry's vision. The writers and director of this revamped franchise claim that they're trying to strike a healthy balance between Roddenberry's Star Trek and what we have now, which is Star Wars where Star Trek hasn't gone before. Don't get me wrong-- I still enjoyed this film, but must say that it's a bit hard to get used to, being a fan of such films as Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country, with their intellectual approach and lighter on action. Speaking of Khan, he was portrayed magnificently in this latest film, and was every bit as evil as the 1982 portrayal of the character. He simply has the right voice to make his character one of the darkest and most menacing in the Star Trek universe. I recommend this film for die-hard fans, and those who want to venture into this series with an open mind.
B00129H7VS|5.0|For the most part, true to the Stephen Ambrose book of the same name, this series provided an amazingly realistic glimpse into the heroism, dedication, and discipline of all the men of Easy Company (of course, things loosened up a bit after victory was at hand) as they marched through France, Holland, Belgium, and Germany. It gave me a deep appreciation for all they went through and the sacrifices they made to help ensure victory for the Allies. To top it all off, I loved the musical scores.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the game and love the daily challenges. This game has become so addicting I want to complete the challenges every day. the challenges are easy enough to complete
B0091QS88K|4.0|I am way older than 5 and 6 but I love the game!!!! It really teaches you more cocking  and gives a lot of good cooking info :3
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Excellent game the only problem is that they want you to buy coins so bad it's difficult to play properly.  That my only concern.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Great music and great voice. Anyone who enjoys this type of music will definitely enjoy listening to this great lady sing.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|What a fun game. I can play with my friends and people i dont know. My recommendation is to get the game.Its so much fun.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|If your gona buy atleast one Megadeth CD this is it. Every song is a hit. One of the best Metal records of all time.
B002IEOLQ0|5.0|Excellent reading for a look the action behind enemy lines and the intense Navy Seal Training he went through. The book gives you insight on how politics ties the hands of our elite soldiers with rules of engagement.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I'm not going to write a novel with pros and cons here, but just say in general that this film was bad and not worth the time and money to rent.<br /><br />The story was predictable and not fully developed with dialogue revealing the holes in the plot.  Acting not so great. Visuals pretty good except for a few sound stage shots that looked dated (perhaps to pay homage to The Wizard of Oz movie?)<br /><br />Wicked on Broadway is such a clever take on the origins of the wicked witch.  If someone was going to make a prequel, I would think they could be more creative than this film was. Even if they were adapting from an original novel, they could have made it better somehow. Overall disappointed.
0743243153|5.0|The Road Less Traveled is a book everyone should read in their lifetime. I found it to be very uplifting and helped me gain perspective on the world and our lives. It helps us reason to the unknowns and Peck does an excellent job engaging the reader. What I also loved about this book is you could begin at honestly any section that sparks interest to a reader-- it doesn't have to be read chronologically. Love it.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The latest version of this application is extremely slow compared to previous versions. All other applications on the Kindle function properly.  This is very frustrating!
B005DC68NI|5.0|What a value!  Unlike many of the little e-books on how to get rich quick with 10 easy tips, David Gaughran really makes the case for self-publishing.  He uses facts to explain the monumental changes in the world of publishing since the advent of the Kindle. He explains the advantages and disadvantages of various publishing arrangements and is realistic about where the industry is going and why.<br /><br />This book is information, not hype.  It shatters myths about self-publishing while offering some sage advice about producing a professional product.  David has worked in the world of publishing and offers his experience at an affordable price.  Thanks to his generosity, I plan to buy his books one after the other.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So much fun! Love playing this at the bar! Can't wait for more levels! Everyone kept asking what we were playing and wanted to join in.

B009WUBERW|3.0|aging action icons in their final days of glory.  The dialogue is horrible but watch it for nostalgic reasons and don't expect anything more.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a fun game that requires time, and strategy. This is better than dragon story and one of the best free apps and best dragon-related app. I recommend it for almost all ages. In this game you can purchase islands to put your habitats on, breed or buy dragons and feed them so they get bigger and acquire more income. You can collect cool rare dragons than take time to breed, but f you want them right away, you will have to pay. !!! Young children may accidentally do this!!! Still a great game though. 5 stars!
B000OVLINI|4.0|On a summer day in 1945, Daniel Sempere's father took him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. He chose a book called The Shadow of the Wind, which turned out to be the last copy. One night, when a faceless strange asked to buy that copy and he refused, he found out that it was the last copy of the book. And someone had been burning all the books by the same author, Julian Carax. As Daniel probed into the life of the author, he began to uncover secrets that should be kept in the dust of time. He discovered a conspiracy to bury the events of the past. He discovered the love affair between Carax and the beautiful Penelope. And he began to step deeper into danger as the evil Inspector Fumero sought to settle an old score...<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is a historical mystery that takes us into post Civil War Barcelona, where the residents tried to return to a normal life. The intertwining events around Julian Carax draw us into love and lost and regret. Although there is a parallel between the Julian-Penelope and Daniel-Bea love affairs, the former outshone the latter as the sun that of a sparkle. And Ferm&iacute;n is as lovable as Fumero is detestable. A mystery as enjoyable as Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game very much.  It is hard too bad there are only 10 levels. Can't wait for more.
0385528752|5.0|I learned so much about human nature, social change and LIFE in this book. The subject matter could be have been theoretical and over my head - but the authors gave such great example stories to illustrate each point. One of the most inspiring lesson in this book is \\"Big Problems, Small Solutions.\\" I loved the relaxed fun style of writing that made this book feel more like having a conversation with a friend than someone lecturing me. I will recommend this book to many people. Thank you!!

1781162646|4.0|A classic Stephen King book with a likeable protagonist and a relatable setting.  At a mere 280 pages it's a third the size of some of his other books.  I don't know if I'm relieved or dissatisfied with that.  Overall a good quick read.  I'm just biding my time until The Shining sequel comes out.
0062255657|2.0|Super short, doesn't live up to the hype in the least, depressing story, very wordy, not really a fantasy, exhaustingly wordy, actually a young adult novel and not a good one at all, redundantly wordy (painfully so) ... Need I go on? This story isn't even novel length. Novella is even pushing it. Short story, VERY short, and not a good story at all if you are seeking to read a fantasy story. Childhood memories will always be skewed, for children view the world through a completely different lens, but damn, what a travesty of a disappointment. And at least it was short.
0385533829|5.0|This book grabbed me from page 1 and I read the entire book on a flight to Hong Kong.  The Noetic Sciences and Freemason incorporation into the plot were fascinating and led me to further reading on Noetic Sciences. I am not sure why all the poor reviews of this book. It was far better than Angels and Demons and much more believable in terms of plot and characters. The book was very long but pacing was excellent and the characters were not doing anything superhuman like parachuting out of an exploding helicopter as in Angels and Demons. This book was as good as Digital Fortress which was also and excellently paced book.<br />The research into the Bible and Noetic sciences was fascinating. I liked the way it was all tied together over a few chapters at the end of the book and not just all explained and wrapped up in one chapter as many thrillers do. It showed the care that Mr. Brown took with the subject research, by fleshing it out over a few chapters so the reader could sit back and relax after the excitement of the previous chapters as the action came to a climax. It would have been unfair to the underlying subject material to just end it after the main action and the villain is revealed. I liked seeing Robert Langdon out of his depth a bit and be surprised by something he did not know.<br />I hope he will revisit some of these themes and characters in later books, it would be a shame to go this deep into such rich fertile soil and then just abandon it as just another day in Robert Langdon's life. I would hope some of the revelations would change the character in some small way or what is the point of this long unwinding novel if it is just a forgotten adventure in his past.<br />Overall it is an engaging read and I would recommend it to everyone. I hope it will eventually be a film in the Robert Langdon canon but I am not sure it had the acclaim of<br />his previous adventures to get this off the ground. I enjoyed all of Dan Brown's books and I look forward to Inferno. I just wanted to state how much I appreciated and enjoyed this novel. It made a 17 hour flight go by much faster as I tuned these pages and got lost in this great story and actually learned more about some interesting topics that I think everyone would benefit from researching further. From my further reading I can see that Noetic Science is attempting to give humanity a bright future by exploring the potential we all have to be greater that we think we can be. As the Beatles said in Yellow Submarine. \\"Its all in the mind \\"......Enjoy....ferno. I just wanted to state how much I appreciated and enjoyed this novel.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I rarely get &#34;hooked&#34; on a TV series, but Downton Abbey had me salivating for more since Season 1. I savor each subtle interchange between the servants and the aristocracy, as well as the historical details embedded in the clothing, set design, and plot.  It's a guilty pleasure you don't have to feel so guilty about.  A must see! and don't let anyone spoil the ending for you... hold your ears and say &#34;nanannaa&#34; until you see it for yourself.

B00633PFQC|1.0|Big fan of Sandel. Fascinated by justice when it was alumni webcast, book, PBS.  But this book is a total failure.  In a book I want answers, or at least ways to analyze. Book is only more questions.  And as book, not even well put.  Questions morality of scalpers of ny Shakespeare but doesn't even mention festival's own &#34;sale&#34; of tickets to supporters, which raises questions festival has grappled with. Dismayed and disappointed. Shallow. Pales compared with either of Sissela Bok's books.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|OK, I know the Avenger's Universe. I know that the creators of the film version of \\"Thor\\" messed with Origins and a lot of the backstory. BUt, c'mon! This is still one fun romp! Not a whole lot of story development, and the best dialogue comes from Loki (which is good, I'm not sure movie Thor, who is all grunt, should be allowed to speak). Don't judge the movie by what Thor Universe is supposed to be, but just take the film for what it is...Thor is reallllly good at fighting, and then he can't, so lost Thor must find his soul. Ta da!

B0020BUWX2|2.0|Like many reviewers, I very much wanted to like this book and was excited to read it.  I'm an adult, but a fan of YA fiction.  At least, I'm a fan of the YA fiction that has some depth to it.  This book has none.  Essentially, it's just a bunch of vignettes about a teen-age girl, Mia, who has (well, had) a perfect life.  Her parents are responsible and wise, but ultra-cool; her brother is an adorable little angel whom she mothers; and her extended family is also very loving.  To top that off, she has a wonderful best friend, and a phenomenal relationship with her boyfriend.  Adam is also super cool (he's in a band, for Pete's sake, even if it does have the completely idiotic name \\"Shooting Star\\").  Mia is also pretty and talented, and well, probably the most well-adjusted teen-ager in real life or fiction.  In fact, both Mia and Adam come across as idealized 30-year-olds.  I can't imagine any teen-ager being able to relate to them.<br /><br />I was so gagged up over how perfect Mia and everyone in Mia's world is that nobody seemed real.  Come on, no conflict between a teen-age girl and her mother?  No resentment over the little brother?  Really?  There's a point in the book, in one of the flashbacks, where someone is describing fantasizing over their own funeral:  the idea is that everyone is gushing over how much they love the dead person.  That's what this book felt like - a fantasy about how much everyone gushes over Mia.  This isn't the first YA novel I've read where a tragedy is used as background to describe the fantasy of the world revolving around the main character (I thought The Sea of Tranquility was like this as well, but that book had more to it than this one).  Do teen readers crave attention this much?  Do they think that a place like Planet Mia really exists?  If so, they are in for a rude awakening.<br /><br />In any case, because the relationships were all so perfect, the characters felt like paper dolls and I didn't really care about the tragedy.The ending also was cloying and predictable.<br /><br />The upside though is that I thought it was decently written with an interesting premise; the flashbacks didn't bother me as a method to tell the story.  I just wish the author had used them to portray a deeper side of Mia, explore serious problems she may have had.  I think the author tried to do that, but the problems were not really problems.  Mia and Adam having been \\"too polite\\" to one another?  Mia feeling out-of-place as a talented classical musician in a rocker family?  Sure, right - and my husband and I fight over who gets to do the chores, and I'm tired of being the sole Pulitzer prize holder in my family of Nobel prize winners.  The bottom line though is that the crucial decision she had to make here - whether to live - didn't seem like a genuinely difficult decision, and it should have been for this book to have any weight.<br /><br />This book has nowhere near the gravitas of The Lovely Bones, or even Twilight.  (At least Bella's decision was truly difficult, and that was well portrayed.)  If you are young and want a shallow romantic fantasy that would make for a good read on the plane, go for it.  But if you expect something with substance, skip this book.

B00340ESIS|2.0|Snyder states, in the middle of the book, what should be on the cover. This book tells you how to write a \\"$100 million Box Office (B.O.) hit,\\" not how to write a film script. His writing style is grating and self congratulatory--the exclamation points! and italics and blatant dropping of in-the-know vernacular are clear evidence that this guy lives and breathes for Hollywood, not for filmmaking. If that's what you're looking for, this is probably a good formula. Writing needs structure, however you want to do it. I don't write movies, I like to watch them, and some obnoxious cool guy insisting that you make the same boring movie as all the other boring Box Office (B.O.) hit movies is depressing as hell. Good luck and I hope never to see your movie.
1579126898|5.0|Agatha Christie wrote quite a number of books in her long literary life which included, in addition to her detection books for which she is most famous, she also wrote a series of romance novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott; wrote at least one children's book and of course a total of 26 plays, one of which, Mouse Trap, is the longest running play in history...over 50 years now.  She is of course best know for her detection novels and one of the best know of these is the one being reviewed here...Death on the Nile.  Many of her works have been turned into movies and T.V. shows.  Death on the Nile is one of those.  This was the 29th of her detection novels.<br /><br />Here again we have the second most famous literary detective, Hercule Poirot (Only outshined by Sherlock Holmes), investigating a murder on a boat that is sailing up the Nile.  This work was published in 1937 and does an amazing job of portraying the English Upper Middle Class traveling abroad as was the custom of those times.<br /><br />There are many excellent plot summaries available here in other reviews so I will be extremely brief.  A very rich, beautiful, and charming young English girl is traveling in Egypt with her new husband on their honeymoon.  The couple is being stalked by the new husbands old girl friend and best exfriend of the newly married young rich lady who just happened to have stolen the groom from her old school chum and best friend.<br /><br />The new bride is murdered - yes, shot in the head and the new husband is shot in the leg.  The books is filled with individuals who may or may not have reason to see this lovely (or is she?) young lady dead.  Poirot is a member of the group making the trip up the Nile...he is on vacation and of course instantly takes over the investigation of the strange murder.  And alas, as so often happens, one murder begets others and the body count is a bit higher in this novel than many of Christie's other works.<br /><br />As with most of this author's novels, she begins introducing characters in brief sketches and slowly as the story unfolds adding flesh, bones and personality to each.  What a diverse group of people had us here!  Toward the end of the book our little detective with all the gray brain cells proves beyond a doubt, one after the other, that many to most of the members of the traveling party are guilty of the crime and then he pulls the chord and proves beyond a doubt that it was not the one in question but rather another.  Christie actually gives us several very sound scenarios to work with.<br /><br />I have to admit to you that I strongly suspected the final outcome - the whodoneit - on this one but for the life of me I could not figure out HOW it was done.  Christies is an amazing writer but as I have stated in other reviews of her work, you either \\"get\\" Christie or you don't.  For those who do, this work is a real treat.  It was one of the books the author herself was most proud of.<br /><br />This was a library find.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks<br />dbship@windstream.netauthor's novels, she begins introducing characters in brief sketches and slowly as the story unfolds adding flesh, bones and personality to each.

I no longer my original village, I have a village that I went to visit one day and when I back to my own village it disappeared. Now I have to play the game on someone else's village. I would like to get my own village back. Other wise I think this is a superb game and play it every day. If you enjoyed the movie you will have so much fun playing this game!

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief, A New York Times bestseller, is an extraordinary novel about the holocaust from the point of view of Death (or the death angel, I prefer) narrator of the story. At the beginning a young girl, Liesel Meminger, is taken to a foster home outside of Munich. It's 1939 and persecution of the Jews is ongoing. Zusak writes beautifully, hauntingly, and convincingly bringing the characters and this time in history to life. Each individual is real and unique. The relationship between Liesel and her step father is a true parenting love story. Similarly, Liesel's friendship and companion in book thievery, Rudy, shows their childlike playfulness in spite of circumstances. The holocaust reality, though disturbing, helps us learn about that time. We must remember it and not let anyone deny it happened. There is humor; there is love and caring, all in the midst of tragedy. This is one of the best novels I've ever read.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|I've been a little disappointed by some of the more rock-oriented turns that KWS has taken; we need talented young artists to keep the true blues tradition alive.  I recently replaced a long-lost copy of this CD/DVD combo and was just as excited and blown away as I was the first time!  As many of the other reviewers have noted, this is no patronizing ego trip.  This is KWS sincerely saluting his blues forebears, more than willing to step aside and join in.  The DVD is wonderful on its own, too--a beautifully shot and edited emotional travelogue of this great music and its practitioners.  I'll never doubt KWS's sincerity again!

1476734941|5.0|I have been doing this eating plan for a couple of months with resounding success. I see it as a solution for yo yo weight gain I have had over the years. As a result of my weight inching up many times, I have tried just about every type of diet: Weight Watchers, Body for Life, Atkins, etc. While some worked better than others (I would rate Weight Watchers as the best choice of the ones I just listed), all diets suffer from \\"falling off the wagon\\" temptation. The main reason for this is boredom and feeling constantly deprived. Neither of these things happen with the Fast Diet because on non-fast days, you can eat the goodies that would have been off limits for most diets. Now, granted, if you go crazy on non-fast days, you can undo the good results. But an occasional day of over-indulging doesn't seem to matter with the Fast Diet as long as one doesn't do it all the time. Eating a healthy normal diet on non fast days is definitely what I shoot for, but I don't stress if I occasionally over do it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this diet, the book and numerous support forums on the Internet. There appears to be plenty of medical evidence that this diet not only improves your waist size, but also your general health. Getting started may see a bit tough, but after a couple of weeks, you get into the groove. This is easy and effective. And, well, what's not to like?
0307476464|1.0|The book is over 900 pages which could have been written in 300 pages.  The story develops very slowly and it ends nowhere.  After going through a torture of reading 920 pages which consist of repetitive sentences, you will come to a vague ending that makes you wonder what the story was about.  I even suspect that Murakami wanted to prolong the story to sell three separate books (that was how they were initially sold in Japan - as three serial books).<br /> Everything that happens in the book is explained in extensive details more than once (although what happened or what the characters felt is clearly conveyed to readers on the first instance it is mentioned).  I felt like I could skip about 20 pages every now and then and the story still remains the same and I wouldn't miss anything.

B00BTHWFBK|3.0|So it's been my entire lifetime, literally i was born in 79, since Ozzy recorded with Black Sabbath for an entire album.<br /><br />The band sounds really solid together.  Ozzy sounds better than he has since his 2001 album Down to Earth.  the production is fairly solid, and while this is a fairly long album, especially with the bonus tracks and the 2 songs from Reunion, which I added on my ipod because I'd been looking for a place to put them and they really didn't go with any previous Sabbath album, this album doesn't really feel long.  It has a really nice flow to it.  Overall this album sounds fairly fresh, even if most of the songs on here are fairly slow.<br /><br />While the songs are decent there are no standout songs, for me, on the standard edition.  I can listen to the whole thing, but there's nothing I'd say I would absolutely put on a best of Sabbath/Ozzy era compilation.  The songs aren't bad, and as I said they flow really well together, so it's an enjoyable listen, but there isn't anything that I look forward to hearing when I hit play on this album, which means I'll likely not listen to it for long.  And why in the hell are there bonus tracks?  These 3 songs should have been on every edition of the album.  Heck Methademic is hands down my favorite song on the album, and the song I would pick for a Sabbath/Ozzy era compilation.  There's no reason for this, especially since cd's hold 80 minutes of music.  So there's no excuse for not putting them all on here, plus they could have given us the 2 bonus tracks I mentioned earlier, so fans could have them on an actual black Sabbath album and not as bonuses just on a live album.  But, that last point I won't hold against them.  But the 3 bonus tracks recorded for this album should have been on here, and I find it unforgivable that they were left off.  Of course there's always illegal downloading, if you get the edition without the bonus songs.  I wouldn't necessarily advocate it, but in the case of bonus tracks, hey they should have came with the album anyways.  Again not necessarily saying to do that, but it's an option.<br /><br />Also the track order doesn't really grab the listener right away, or at least me it didn't.  we're treated to 2 really long and slow paced songs as the opening.  They're decent songs, but they don't exactly make for a nice intro.  the previously mentioned Methademic would have made a much better opening track.<br /><br />There are also several moments which sound like rip offs of previous Sabbath tunes, Planet Caravan and Black Sabbath mainly, but there is another part of the first track which reminds me of another song I can't remember the name of.  I'm ok with the homage to their title song.  it's kind of fitting, and Zeitgeist comes off fairly well done.  I guess I'm not saying their decisions to reuse ideas is a good or bad thing, just something I've noticed.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent listen, and if you're a fan of Ozzy era Black Sabbath this is a must buy, just get the bonus tracks as well.  I just wish there'd been more standout tracks.

B009MYARIK|5.0|Wedding Night by Sophie Kinsella. 5★ ♥♥<br /><br /> \\"Youth is still where you left it, and that's where it should stay. Anything that was worth taking on life's journey, you'll already have taken with you.\\"<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. I loved both Lottie and Fliss's life. I think this is Sophie's first book with 2 character's point of view (both sisters). And normally I don't feel connected to the divorced-single-mom. But Fliss's bitterness, etc., over the divorce was quiet realistic. And Lottie. Well I agree (slight spoiler) that one should never try to return to their youth times. And I laughed out loud quite a bit at some of the \\"honeymoon from hell\\" scenes.<br /><br />A really good Kinsella book. I think it's better then I've Got Your Number.<br /><br />Also, in regard to this book being contemporary fiction, well... it's Sophie Kinsella and Brit humor. This may be a rom-com, but Sophie tries her best to help her readers relate to the characters. Sometimes she goes to the extreme of today's woman *cough Shopaholic* but these stand alone books are good.<br /><br />Wedding Night also has me thinking what it would be like to revisit some of my youth favorite vacation spots. There's places that I've enjoyed so much that I'll tell others that it's a must to add to places to go and see. So now I'm questioning what it would be like to go back to those places. And how much the place has changed as well as myself.<br /><br />Questions of how much I have changed since the last time I've been there and if the place has changed at all. Even childhood camping places because we're still telling people about them. Like Leo Carrillo State Beach in Malibu, California. We love that place when we were kids. Camping and swimming at the ocean... such fun. What would it be like to revisit it? Hmmmm...

0307593525|5.0|I am writing this review because today i tried Julia's Ratatouille technique and it was simply  fantastic. I bought the set 2 years ago, after seeing the movie 'Julie and Julia'. I used to cook before, had some nice books, and this helped fill in many blanks. I am a veggie, and still found plenty of recipes to try, and still many are left! I tried my hand at the omlet cooked in butter, and it was smashing; all apple tarts recipes are excellent; soups: onion is the one everyone remembers to mention, but do not forget the garlic soup, it will be simply great on a cold day! Many recipes are really cheap to make, and with a short ingredients list.<br />Volume 2 seems to be useful as well. I did the mousaka (replaced the meat with soy), and several soups. The pastries are much better represented in Vol 2 than the first, and If you're ready  to spend 11h making croissants, then this will give you all the info you need, in the greatest detail.<br />I'm in Bucharest, so the whole American measuring system is not at all used here, so in the end i simply stopped transforming into grams and ml and bought a set of measuring tablespoon/teaspoons, and voila! All problems solved.

B000O599ZS|5.0|I think this is John Wayne's finest movie. You don't get what this movie's about if you see it once and and think its only a cowboys and indians western.
0385302320|1.0|I love Diane Gabaldon books.  I bought this book to have a hard bound copy for my library.  I passed on other books because they said that they did not have the dust cover.  So my assumption was that this one had it ... which is why I bought this particular book.  When it arrived, not dust cover.  Very disappointed.  Now the hunt is on to find the dust cover.
B00785P2QC|1.0|Not that good.needs work when building to a star it should not be able<br />To funtion but pretty good job none the less NOT its terrible do not play it
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|When I touch the screen, the game closes on me. Wanted to give this game a shot.  Maybe it doesn't like that I'm rooted?
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I really enjoy the vocals of Andrea Bocelli. This man can really sing with the best of them. Word 1. Word 23
0385311400|1.0|I love Diane Gabaldon books.  I bought this book to have a hard bound copy for my library.  I passed on other books because they said that they did not have the dust cover.  So my assumption was that this one had it ... which is why I bought this particular book.  When it arrived, not dust cover.  Very disappointed.  Now the hunt is on to find the dust cover.<br /><br />Again, I have no idea why I need to add 20 more words.  This is stupid.
0307200477|5.0|I read this to my children and now my grandchild. It's just as node full as I remembered it. My granddaughter loves it too.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Read the book and watched a couple of the adaptations. This is by far the closes adaptation to the book. Enjoyed it very much
1596912375|5.0|I happened to see the film version of this story on Robert Redford's Sundance Channel. Intrigued, I bought a used paperback and couldn't put it down. No doubt about it. William Boyd spins a really engaging, historically accurate novel. I still go back and will read certain sections of this book. I would buy a DVD of this movie if possible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game... my 5 year old plays this game for hours on end... I have to pry the kindle away from her to get her into something else.

B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I live right by Nikola Tesla's lab in NY. That's why I bought this game. I found it challenging and fun.  I totally recommend this game for the Tesla fan or anyone who likes a good hunt with puzzles in between. There were an s politely no glitches and the graphics were great.
B007UR1OHO|4.0|I love true stories so I really liked this movie. Great acting and story line. I would watch this again.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a wholesome little film that takes an unexpected route to the heart warming ending. The star of the show are the scene stealing minions but the whole cast shines.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|font size it great.  the calculator is easy to use.  works just like a regular calculator.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Sat down to play and a couple hours flew by!  Fun and simple.  I am enjoying it.<br /><br />Only suggestion for dev would be to add an option to see tool tips on planets again if you just tap and hold or something.
0756697875|5.0|My 4 yr old never puts this book down. He loves the bonus Batman figure, and now like to make believe he and daddy are Batman and Robbin.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Easy to use & update. Quick to check.  Haven't figured out how reminders work yet. Glad I downloaded this free app.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|I love this book! it is so twisted and you want to keep following the story. its neat how the author links so many people together, the secret way that people are linked in real life. this is something I reread over and over a will never grow tired of. when I read the book I always tend to paint my finger nails blue. [you'll get it if you read it;)]
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun puzzle game that keeps you guessing in every level. Good memory puzzles unlike other door games that get boring after a while.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Remember I purchased this app when it was free and I enjoyed it very much. I am not giving five stars because there was no real plot.  But other then that the game is simple and is up to five player.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great time killer, super easy and way funny. Mini games are really cool. Just need friends to pay with other than that, it's a really fun game I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Short and sweet, these are hands down the best headphones I have ever owned. The only drawback is the comfort but after you experiment a bit and find the size that fits your head best that becomes a non issue.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great, fun game. Like how its free; some ads but not too bad. Better than on the iOS, it only has 10 levels.  (KindleFire1stGeneration)
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|Absolutely great western...in historical context.<br />Henry Fonda in a rare role...Love him, Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale and Charles Bronson.<br />Great soundtrack-love that Robards' and Bronson's characters have their own theme songs!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Works on Kindle Fire HD just like it does on my laptop. Would not expect anything less from Kindle or YouTube.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game isn't like others you actually has to check the whole room and lice objects together to figure out how to get keys and answers to open boxes and ect.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|I soooo love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together in movies! My first experience with them was Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did not disappoint! My 16 year old son told me that the steel book versions were a must for a video collection and I have to say they're pretty darn awesome! we just bought the trilogy Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and now Paul. Definitely a must have for the Pegg/Frost collector!!!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I've loved Bond since i was a teenager &<br />Daniel Craig's Bond in this fun romp<br />takes it over the top.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesomeness on a 7&quot; screen. The graphics are good and the controls are good too. I like this  game .
B0089LOG02|4.0|I found this a very readable and well constructed story which is interesting because it is based on historical events.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love this app.  Love mixing the sounds. Go to sleep every night to it. Still experimenting with the binaural and am not convinced they are effective, but time will tell.<br /><br />will tell.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I had never read any of Neil Gaiman's books before; The Ocean at the End of the Lane was the first. Although not my typical genre, I enjoyed this adult Gothic ghost story. It was interesting and thought-provoking, especially regarding the helplessness of children in the adult world.<br /><br />A seven-year-old nameless boy who was misunderstood by his father, socially awkward, and a loner, met his first friend, Lettie Hempstock, when a border at his home committed suicide in their minivan near the Hempstock farm. Lettie was a special character and the world in which she lived with her \\"mother,\\" and \\"grandmother,\\" was filled with mysteries and loving peculiarities and oddities. My favorite parts of the novel were between Lettie and the boy and their growing friendship. An evil was unleashed as a result of their companionship; although the boy suffered and was frightened, he was no longer alone, and that made him stronger.<br /><br />There were parts of this book that I still don't fully understand, but I continue to contemplate and discuss different chapters of the book that I believe were left purposefully ambiguous. The story has stayed with me, as every good story should.<br /><br />Although from cover to cover the novel is only 181 pages, and some may find the price cost prohibitive, this reader was glad that she stepped out of her comfort zone and experienced something new and different. It was not a book for everyone, but it was for me.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Get it. But spend the money to buy the better weapons. Trust me, you'll need them if you want to climb the ranks.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded the game after reading the reviews.As soon as I started playing it it froze up my Kindle. The Kindle would not turn off & it sucked my battery.after several hours recharging we were able to do a reboot. I got rid of the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Want more this was a great game well worth the money spent to get it I recommend it to anyone who loves a good mind game
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Great book I must say it left me with chills, wish their was more to  the ending but it wad a great book all in all loved it. The mystery was great, the suspense. Kept me wondering, also great plot and lay out
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I loved this book as a teen and I loved it more as a senior citizen.  What a lovely story and the prose was so perfect.  I can't wait to read it again!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|After I purchase this app I deleted the others, the varieties of sound are perfect, very natural ,used with ear phones make it more impressive. If you want a great sound app look no further.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Seems like he can't do anything wrong.  Each book he writes is just a little bit better than the last one.  I try and follow when he will have a new one.
B007GQPCE0|5.0|I saw the Duke tour back in 1980 so this cd brings back great memories every song on this cd is great so pick it up now as it is hard to find in stores!
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A thought provoking and interesting read about a difficult topic. Although I preferred Jojo Moyes &#34;The girl you left behind&#34;.
B0042JSMV4|5.0|I first picked up this book at my local book store. I have used this book for different border options and I loved it so much that I wanted to buy it again for the convenience of having it on my tablet.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|First, I hope you find this review helpful from a U.S. fan of foriegn cinema.  I have a large collection of foriegn films with most of them originating in Asia, and this film moves into my top 10 of historical action / drama.  If you've haven't seen \\"IP MAN\\" 1-4, then I suggest watch those first before you  see a semi matserpiece like \\"Grandmaster\\".  You may see mixed reviews for GRANDMASTER, but that is due to martial arts actor Donnie Yen setting the bar so high for martial arts action in IP MAN 1&2.  IP MAN films 1&2 where higly inaccurate in regards to the history of Yip Man, but was quit entertaining due to the skills Donnie Yen executed on screen.  Wont talk to much about IP MAN 3&4 because you want to hear about GRANDMASTER, but they wereok films to watch.  GRANDMASTER had more then enough fignht seens in it to establish itself as a great martial arts film.  The fight scenes portray the proper artistic execution of kung fu, and do not shy of creativity.  The acting is executed with perfection, and i really didn't expect it.  The only issue I have with the film is that it seems to jump all over the place sometimes, but this is probably due to me watch the IP MAN series.<br /><br />What I will say next DOES NOT reflect this specific DVD from this seller.  I originally purchased a pirated version of this off ebay.  I know it is hard, but try and find an original dvd.  Also make sure to get the uncut version.
B005H9B2CE|2.0|Looking at Thor  both from present-day time and his existence in the \\"past,\\"  creates a situation where Thor must recognize and accept/understand his dual existence.
B00A2IUHM6|2.0|I love the concept behind this movie. A Teddy Bear that comes alive an is a pretty cynical character. Unfortunately, the creators of Ted pretty much turned their brains off after coming up with this concept. Rather than trying to write witty or actually funny humor, Ted falls back on a stream of vulgar scenes. The teddy bear, Ted, can't go a single scene without a curse word or talking about sex. I don't mind some R- or X-rated material in comedies, but too many comedies nowadays seem to think comedy is just a string of vulgarity.<br /><br />Like many things, vulgarity in comedy works so long as it's witty or original. Too often Ted beats you over the head with the vulgarity. For example, the idea of Ted wanting to bed a hot blond is funny. Seeing him squirt lotion on his face to imitate ejaculate is just disturbing. The movie could have been a lot better if it had dialed back a bit and gotten better writers.<br /><br />That said, the CGI used to create Ted is absolutely convincing. Hair is always tough to replicate with CGI so the fact that Ted looks so real is pretty impressive.
B001F12J0C|5.0|how can anyone ever say that this was not a great series of movies. each one better and more action packed than the previous one...matt damon is great and will be a superstar for many years to come.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I liked it, but I probably liked the first season better. Jessica Lange is excellent in both series. I'm looking forward to the next season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids (ages 5 and 8) LOVE this game!  I have it on my iphone, Kindle Fire, and ipad.  I don't play it because it's too hard for me.  ;-)  Great graphics too!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I've been waiting to get this since I saw them on the BBC @ Glastonbury..... I'm Not disappointed at all!
6304936303|5.0|this is also a bruce willis classic...ties in well with the die hard movies...action packed and never gets old. love it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is one of my favorites. I love the characters and getting a chance to 'peek' inside the lives of the wealthy and their servants.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was way better than the movie, I loved it! I recommend reading all l the books rather you've seen the movies or not
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|The Evil Dead remake has good practical effects, but the film is pointless.<br />It is pointless because it misses the point of the original film(s), and that is that the demons of the forest cannot be vanquished with a piece of bathroom sink or a chainsaw because they are in essence THE FOREST.<br />Demons do not shuffle along shooting nailguns at people, nor do they hang out in bathtubs waiting for humans so they can scare them.<br /><br />Demons are fast, they fly, and they can transfer into a person immediately. This is why they are so amazing in the original, and this is why the remake is so weak. By playing the film \\"straight,\\" the filmmakers of the remake have only succeeded in making the fantastic so much more mundane, and if you want to make an afternoon special about the horrors of drug abuse then make one, but don't take a great original film and make it some lame commentary about the girl fighting demons which are really the demons of her heroin addiction. It's just lame.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|this was a very good action packed show...wasnt expecting bruce willis to be as active as he was....what a pleasnt surprise
1609611543|2.0|With all the positive reviews I expected better.  The discussion of the genetic changes in wheat was very interesting, but after  exclusively discussing wheat the whole time, the recommended changes to diet went well beyond wheat.  If the problem really was just wheat you would expect some recommendations for other replacement grains, but while he does not discuss other grains in any detail, everything gets the axe, including rice and oats.  You are left with a pedestrian low carb diet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great for every body there is no blur the horses are awesome. You should download this app
0770437400|3.0|The book is ok. A little hard to get through and a little hard to follow. But if you like stories about the zombie apocalypse, give it a try!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|We've always been fans of Josh Groban, but he has outdone himself on &#34;All That Echoes&#34;. His raw talent, the song choices and the amazing musicians and back-up singers make this the best Josh Groban album ever.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This is a must have if you have an Android and work on a lot of Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, PPT).  This has been a life saver!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|was great now its all ads cannot even find hourly updates.&ntilde; going to delete &amp;go back to real tv local weather channel. these  constant app updates just make them worse not better. thanks again to an app that  upgraded  in reverse and now is worth squat

B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome horse app I ever got I love it. its a very fun app. I hope you guys love it too.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Loved this book, I am fortunate to have a signed 1st edition and just holding it brings pleasure.  The feel of the book jacket and the font used inside all lead to the magical quality of the book.  Read it in one evening then went to bed after finishing it.  It seeped into my dreams.  You can imagine yourself meeting a girl like Lettie and feeling as scared as the boy (who is never named) does of the real and other worldly things that happen to him.  The boy talks of his love of books, his kitten, all normal childhood things that then get caught up in this fairy tale, that they say is for \\"adults\\", but remember \\"The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups.\\"
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great continuation for Eva and Gideon! If you liked the first two in the crossfire series, you will love this one as well! I can't wait for the next book!!!
B00C2U6EUG|5.0|I love Hans Zimmer - While this album is fairly simple and repetitious it's very good, worth a lot of listens.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting.  We love the Despicable Me Movies and my son has played a similar game.  Overall great fun!
B00B7ERH04|5.0|Works very good, take good pictures, and very easy to use. LIKE  IT TOO CAUSE IT IS FREE and it worksssssssss
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Buy It, watch it, love it!!!  This movie is just precious.  What a wonderful story in many ways  Happy sometimes, sad somtimes, but you will never be bored during this movie.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|Got app from Amazon. It's listed in 'My Apps' but when i try to open the game it says I don't own this app! Then when I go to amazon &amp; try to ipen it, it says there is an &quot;internal Network&quot; issue. What gives?
B005L18C4E|5.0|Great insight into the world of 15th century Europe and an excellent expose of the state of the Catholic church in a state of decadence.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is awesome it is so cool that u get to play against other players and not against a computer so worth playing!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is fun and challenging. good if you like to search for hidden items and solve puzzles. recommended for all ages
1449305172|5.0|Ash knows how to build products that people want, and also succeed at sharing his knowledge well. He explains with simple words how to have a rigorous and scientific approach for your startup development. The book is full of best practices and concrete examples. I highly recommend anyone who's working on an entrepreneurial project to read it. Nice job Ash! Looking forward to reading the next one!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good game it's a serious mystery and really cool I don't like how u have to pay 5.00 dollars for the whole thing but by that it's really good
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was unaware of the history of the orphan trains that carried abandoned, or homeless children to be presented to potential adoptive parents, employers from the Northeast to the Midwest. Devistatingly sad times when children were subject to exploitation, abuse and indiference is mind boggling.  A great read.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The author is in control of the whole process! Even if your manuscript was not written in the specific format to accommodate the eBook upload, the text can easily be corrected. The process is logical, user friendly, and there are helpful hints to get you over the rough spots.  I am in the final edit stage of one, of the three books I will be uploading. Getting ISBN's are easy, so why pay someone to do what you can do? If you have several books on the market, they will all show up under your name. EBooks are perfect for consumers who read on the go and authors who want to jumpstart their writing careers!
B005KELW26|5.0|After I purchased the Folio, I started taking my Kindle Fire everywhere with me.<br />It fits nicely in my bag and the Folio protects my Kindle Fire from scratches, etc.<br />It's not bulky or heavy, looks nice and it's easy to use. I looked around for other<br />cases and found most of them expensive and poor quality. This was a good fit<br />for me!
B008MEM24S|5.0|my little brother loves this game i get hime quient when im out on the rode and he keeps buging me.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Another great album from Queens of the Stone Age. Collaborations with Trent Reznor, Dave Grohl, Sir Elton John, etc. Dark feel, love this band.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was excellent. Witty, charming, the female lead strong, but vulnerable, the guy, self centered, but lovable. This book was well written and I don't think I have ever belly laughed so much from a book in my life!  I made my poor husband listen to my favorite parts. Excellent job, Emma Chase.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|I downloaded this because it was a free app. Wanted to give my grand daughter a game on my Kindle. Very few options in the free game and little direction as to how to play it. I quickly removed the app.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|great game. sometimes it can be challenging but its very fun getting past each level. works great too on my kindle
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am so captivated already it was so hard to put down!!  I absolutely cannot wait to read the rest and then see the movie!
B00ALSOKSY|4.0|fascinating book with brilliance everywhere. I just need to be in the mood to concentrate when listening to this author!
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|Always a good one to watch, great actors, storyline. Thought we owned it and wanted to see it on Fourth of July, so we rented it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I bought this game for serious intellectual fun and was disappointed by the rudimentary game mechanics. Would not recommend for mature gamers. However, it does supply a therapeutic sensation while interacting with the virtual horse without the inconvenience of finding a live horse.
0142004413|5.0|This is my favorite book in the world. My entire family has read it and loves it.  I often give as a christmas gift and everyone has loved it.
006114665X|5.0|An extraordinary product of meticulous research which reframes the way we look at World War 1 from a truly global perspective. The book moves the reader to rethink questions about &#34;inevitability&#34; and contingency.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love James Rollins.  I felt like I was just visiting with my best friends, sigma force, and another great mission accomplished.

B008HT4FUW|5.0|Love, Love, Love the entire series and I looked forward to  the season's #3 and coming very soon, #4, ENJOY!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|A true classic of horror fiction which features some truly poetic, if melodramatic, writing. A must read for any who enjoys vampire literature as it essentially created the genre.
0375831002|4.0|had to get this for a book report for English and am still reading, is interesting, but took a few chapters to get into
B008220C38|5.0|If you all love Downton Abby, you will also love this one!  It is another English type movie that keeps our attention and we hold on tight until it is ended and then want to have it continue.  These are all on PBS or were last year sometime,
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i had so much fun playing this game. great challenges that make you really put some effort into it. loved this game so much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game challenging but not frustrating. I recommend it for all puzzle lovers. Everyone should at least check this game out!
B005MHI0QM|3.0|I enjoyed this book well not only for the diary part but also for the aspect in which how much you really felt as though you were in that scenario with anne I recommend this book to readers that enjoy thrills as much as they do with love stories.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Other protectors that I found in the office supply store did not cover the corners of the Kindle like this one does. Two thumbs up!
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|When I insalt the game I see all of these karzy lines and I can't play  even when I have 4 bars on wifi
B00004Z400|4.0|White Pony is a great Deftones album. Great songs and lyrics.  Even though Chino is gone (rip) the Deftones,  are still killing it live.  Go see them in your town.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|it was a little hard to follow. But it was intense!!!! I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great and addicting game!!!!!!!!! Would definitely recommend this game to everyone and everyone. Definitely 5 stars!!!!! Fun!!!!!
B002SAUCBC|2.0|I'm generally a fan of King's books, but this one was tiresome.  The theme is that a bunch of teens volunteer to go on this epically long non-stop walk until all but one is dead and the survivor basically gets whatever they want for life.  Not a bad premise, but does it ever drag on!  It starts off okay, but the bulk of the book is the teens philosophizing about life with occasional paragraphs in the middle of it about the teens being picked off one by one for slowing down or pausing in their walk (which can't be slower than 5 mph.....for those of you who think this is a reasonable walking pace, just try keeping up with a car going 5 mph.  While walking.)<br /><br />My main complaint is that there just isn't much of a plot line. It's very basic and is almost all the kids speculating about the meaning of life and their hopes and regrets, etc.  Not what I was expecting from King.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I've always loved Ocean Princess when I heard it on Youtube a couple of years ago (you know how you get to things on Youtube by clicking on a link from a link from a link?).  A few days ago, I came across Illusions, and because a few of the songs caught my attention on Youtube, I decided to get the whole album. NO regrets whatsoever.  There is absolutely no bad track.  If you are a fan of epic trailer music -- or of any evocative orchestral/choral music, for that matter-- you will love this album. I very much look forward to this composer's next output.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is awesome you get to shoot people playing online and you get to choose team battle and a lot of stuff.
B000FC1192|5.0|Nice and scary. Would be a weird combination for a children's book, but not for Neil Gaiman. Needless to say, it is much better than the movie.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've been to the play many times. It is no longer on broadway here in New York. This movie beings a piece of the theater district into your living room. I loved it ( not as much as the live play) but excellent!!!
B00006JSS8|5.0|I love this collection of stevie wonder songs.This collection did not leave out any of my favorites.I am not a big stevie guy but this cd is really good.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If someone likes action, and science fiction, this is the movie to get.  They picked the right cast for the movie, as well as the music.  It's one to get if you have the first one.  I would not be surprised if this movie got a lot nominations. Or even several Oscars when they give them out.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I have been watching older wholesome tv series with my little girl. We watched the little house series and the Walton's. I had never seen an episode of Dr Quinn, so on blind faith and reading others reviews I purchased the series. We are thoroughly enjoying it. I even got my husband to watch with us!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and you can never get board!!! The levels are challenging and exciting!! Definitely recommend it!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Similar to his last effort, a good book. But not nearly as good as the kite runner. But it is entertaining.
B001YV504U|5.0|Well written, well played, good picture! Nothing to add! Maybe some bonuses would have made this set fantastic!<br />Clear picture and good sound.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My granddaughter constantly wants my kindle to play her horse game. Such a great and helpful game. We have horses ans she has learned so much.
B00BLRXDTQ|3.0|First disc is region locked, no indication on the box of region restriction.<br />Cheap design and fragile amaray box in the tin box.<br />Good movies, not the best transfer but still worth the purchase, maximum price 25$.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|A good book to pass the time. It was Not as great as I expected, but still a good read.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I purchased this first season for my brother on his birthday and we have been really sucked into the great story line. He has read the first book in the series and has said this is a good representation of the book. We are looking forward to purchasing the next several seasons.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I normally like games like this, but this one has no helpful clues. I also found that when I need to stop playing, the game does not seem to save the last level I was working on & I need to start over again.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|THIS CD PROVES THAT EVEN 40 YEARS AFTER THE &#34;ALOHA FROM HAWAII&#34; VIA SATELLITE, ELVIS IS STILL THE KING !<br /><br />I BOUGHT 1 COPY FOR ME AND THE SECOND ONE FOR A DEAR FRIEND AND WE BOTH LOVE IT !
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really good,the only downside is that there are connection issues. I try connecting to Facebook (as is required for various mission sets) but even though my internet connection is fine, it comes up with the message 'Cannot connect to F. It's really annoying and from what I have seen while looking for help on the internet, a common problem!If it helps I am using a kindle fire HD.[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|RIP! Started a little corny, but quickly picked up speed. House of Batiatus story is fascinating. Ashur is amazing villian!
B002UXRH10|5.0|Rihanna's Rated R album is my #1 favorite album out of all her other albums because this album you can tell that Rihanna really opens herself up. She put her emotions into this album which makes the album great. Rated R (album) might be slow, dark, edgy, and depressing in some peoples eyes but for me it's great! My favorite tracks are...Wait your turn, Russian Roulette, Rude Boy, Rock Star 101, Te Amo, and Hard.
B0098VXDDS|5.0|Miss Andy Whitfield, but Liam McIntyre is a worthy replacement! Crixus, Ganicus, Agron, Naevia, Lucretia, Illythea story lines are compelling!
B003FMTZOM|5.0|Not only is Christina Aguilera one of my favorite artists but when I bought this album I said to myself \\"Wow this album is amazing and every song on here is sexy, fun, and great to dance to. :) Bionic is my one of my favorite albums from Christina Aguilera. I own Bionic, Stripped, and Lotus ! <3 Christina Aguilera <3
B005MMYEF8|5.0|I have become obsessed with everything Spartacus! Show is great! Batiatus Solinius partnership turned to rivalry was very interesting. Highly recommended!
B005TZFYNE|5.0|When I bought this album for my mother as a birthday gift she said wow thank you so much honey I really like it ! Rihanna's talk that talk album is fun and awesome ! Every song on here is sexy, fun, and great to dance to. It also makes a great dance album.<br />My favorite tracks are... Farewell, Cockiness(Love it), Birthday Cake, Where have you been, and Drunk On Love. =D
B004SUWR2C|1.0|, If i would. If If I could give this app zero stars it never loads it takes up A LOT of room and it is just plain stupid save your money
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this app because it ties in with the show, and all the &quot;littlest&quot; pets are so cute!!! I also like the pet games. They are SO much better then the My Little Pony ones by Gameloft! I recommend this app loads!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate the new version.  I will be uninstalling as soon as I finish this review.  I have already installed another app.  The new app is ok but I would like the original weather channel app without update back.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I almost passed on this one because of so many reviews either saying it is unclear on how to play &amp; frustrating, or that the AI cheats, dies things player can't, or had such an advantage that it is unbeatable. The instructions are few, but they do provide the needed information: to send ships, slide your finger from one of your planets in the direction of the planet you want to claim, win, or defend.<br />I won my very first round and each round after up to rank 14, at which point I stopped to write this review. I started each round sending ships to one planet for a few seconds, then switching to the other planet. Then I surveyed the board for which might need more ships, &amp; switched back if necessary. As I won planets I applied the same strategy to the new planets.<br />Perhaps the people who wrote negative reviews thought you can only send ships in one direction until that planet is won? That's the only way I can think of that would make the beginner AI seem unbeatable.
B00CTEP7O4|4.0|It's very enjoyable and doesn't require you to think too much (which is nice when you just want to watch something and relax), but the plot often doesn't make sense and/or is not too believable.
B003B02PEU|4.0|ANOTHER DOWN TO EARTH SOUTHERN STYLE STORY  WHICH JOHN  GRISHAM IS BEST. A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI  WITH INTERESTING CHARACTERS.  AN OUTSIDER BUYS THE NEWSPAPER  AND SLOWLY  BUT SURELY,  ACCEPTED  AS HE WRITES HIS BOLD STORIES.
B009CF7GRY|1.0|It was only vaguely like the original and did not hold my interest.<br />It was not very good and I stopped watching about halfway through.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun to pass the time with and to come back to every now and then. It's kind of like farmville
B008EAWF4W|5.0|I loved everything about this book and I was truly terrified while reading it because of the realism. I've probably read World War Z three times and it is still one of my favorite reads.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is the sequal to the first attempt to put this comic character ( I believe he may be mostly popular in Australia and possibly England though there is also a following in the US) on the silver screen The first was \\"\\"Judge Dredd\\" starring Sylvester Stallone, a totally dreadful Movie( no pun intended, but the move was a terrible adaption of the Dredd character). This movie removes much of the over the top costuming of the 1st movie, even if at times the silli costuming was more consistent with the comic book, in favor of still pretty odd but more functional gear. You never actually see Dredd's face, which is just one of several subtle political message overtones that I chose to ignor in favor of simply enjoying the ride of this intense non- stop action movie.<br />As in the comic, it takes place in a post- apocalyptic  world (don't they all?) where most of the viable living space has been destroyed and remaining mankind are forced to live in extremely congested and squalid high rise ghetto-like structures located in massive urban cities crowded with millions of inhabitants. Gangs and criminality are everywhere and the remaining powers that be have resorted to the use of highly specialized forces that act as judge, jury and, if need be, on the spot executioner. The movie takes place with judge Dredd and a female rookie who is a mutant with enhanced ESP powers and on her test run to become a judge.<br />As any comic transfer, this would sound like a silly premise but in fact the CGI is very good, the movie really proved to be unique in many aspects and the acting pretty good. Not surprisingly, if violence and Sci Fi is not your thing, then this is not for  you. But this has genuine suspense, leaves you rooting for a hero in spite of his human flaws and ended leaving me eager for a sequal.<br />Believe me when I say this is NOT an Asylum made for tv cheesy SviFi movie. There are no giant bizarro creatures, aliens nor Zombies who win just when you think the movie is over and the day was saved. All the characters are human and the plot easily connects to current events. However it is no \\" Citizen Zane' so don't expect award nominations.<br />So, why the 5 stars? Simply because both my wife and I just plain enjoyed it. We never felt we were watching something geared for adolescents, we could enjoy and have a good time without delving into any deeper political messages, though one is free to do so if they please, and we found the gadgets, story-line and special effects and costuming all engaging. We liked it enough to purchase the 3D version. Absolutely, you do NOT need the 3D version to enjoy this flick, but I want to say the 3d translation, while not quite as good as it could have been (true of so many 3D movies) still capable of adding a huge and enjoyable dimension. We became aware of events that completely passed by our awareness in the 2D version.<br />Finally, I understand some of the lower ratings. Movies are a very personal thing, just like wine, food and the opposite sex. I am simply writing as a fan of SciFi who is weary of all the zombie, giant creatures and vampire/ werewolfs, and horribl CGI that pass for entertainment lately.<br />As for me, I am no kid. I am a \\" mature\\" citizen who still happens to like many of the same things I did in my youth. If you watch this movie, I truly hope you enjoy it!
B006QKJQM6|1.0|We could not watch the movie because the sound was not clear and at times seemed to &#34;short out&#34;. I changed the speakers thinking they were the culprit but that did not resolve the problem. We never got past the intro.
1781162646|5.0|Love this book. I learned a lot about theme parks, even though the author claims that he made a lot of stuff up, It sounded good to me. I didn't know that there was a new Stephen King novel until I ran across it on Amazon. It was like winning the lottery. The problem with Stephen King stories is that I cannot read them fast enough & then they end.. The protaganist is very appealing & one really wants him to do well. I loved the charactor of the park owner. A decent, honest man, who really took fun seriously. I liked all the charators, even the villain was very interesting. Another great story from the King.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think we need more time also. Otherwise great game very creative but no way to get inside fences and lots of my farm animals jump out.
B003O86FMW|1.0|Ive loved the hunger game s since the first words in book two.now im readind book three monkingay cant wait !!!!!!!! Everyone should read these books foreal i love them
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Remember when?? I do. And because the tapes were too old to rock anymore, I got cd's. Great AC/DC. It'll take you back to original heavy rocking and you won't be disappointed. Go back and stay young. ROCK IT!!!!!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|It was in great shape when my grandson received this for his birthday.  He has already watched this 5 times.  Will have to buy one for myself.  Hearing great raves.  The movie arrived the day they said it would.  Thanks.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Bought this for &#34;Secrets&#34; but am getting hooked on the rest. Still a timely CD. Came on time and in a bubble envelope. Worth a purchase for sure.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|The story, like the castle, never stopped moving. I couldn't put it down. I was happy that Howl turned out to be a good guy in the end, sort of.

B00008WT5E|5.0|I've been a fan since the beginning. Bought this because tapes were just getting too worn for any more playing. It's AC/DC~~get on board and get ready to move your body. Open your mind to ROCK 'n ROLL. It's never too late.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is by far one of the most beautiful stories I've ever read.  I laughed. I cried.  Then, I found myself smiling through my tears at the beauty.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent acting, storylines. Just a great show all around and the best I have seen in recent years. I cant believe this one on PBS.
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|I'm not too hard on my cell phones. I bought this case a few months ago. I dropped my phone for the first time yesterday from a standing position on a tile floor. No damage. It worked!
6304806418|5.0|This is one of my 72 year old Mom's favorite movies.  She actually saw it in the theater multiple times and she doesn't like theaters.  Best movie Madonna has ever done - her voice is stellar.  Much better than her Popular music.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is THE Sabbath album we Sabbath fans have been dying for for a long time.  It took me back to my early childhood days when I got my first LP at Christmas - Black Sabbath Paranoid! Not their first, but I got the 1st quickly after 1 spin of Paranoid!!<br /><br />Black Sabbath have been the standard to which all real Heavy Metal to date is compared against, and the masters have really pulled it off this time.  Yes, there are a few some slow and boring tracks as compared to 'todays' metal, but this CD is all about the VIBE of Black Sabbath from years ago, yet adding some more modern guitar stuff of today.  Either way, this is just great stuff and it really brought back that 'vibe'...that sound that just blew me away back in the mid-70's....you just don't feel that way these days about music, and get really excited about it.  Long Live the Sabbath!!
0061900664|5.0|La lectura del libro es miy llevadera y mi hijo de dos años se ha identificado con las cosas que dicen acerca de las diferencias de un bebé y un niño más grande. Ya se sabe algunas partes del libro y entendió que el será pronto un hermano mayor.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A compelling read. A young girl witnesses a heinous crime, she then tells a story to the police to protect her Mother. Years later as her Mother is unwell she returns to her Mother's house to try and establish why her mother did what she did. The story unfolds to the reader and kept me awake far too late while I read on to learn the truth.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|This is great SF. I loved the book as I loved those by Asimov. The development of Ender, the fact that he was a child, the true motivation of the bugger enemy. The twist behind the game. A great read!
B00BM7ORFO|3.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but once I got going I quite enjoyed it. It touches on alcoholism, domestic violence and life as a beaten wife. The subjects are well written and gives an insight into the mind of the abuser.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I bought this because I thought I would be able to see the person I was taking a picture of for the Kindle Fire HD. But it is the same as the camera that comes on the Kindle Fire HD. So I am kind of disappointed.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game, but could have used  a walkthrough for level one because the directions were realy short. Luckily, I found internet cheats.
B00BVVA138|2.0|This was far from Alive or Just Breathing...and not really in a good way.  This was as Howard Jones said when he first heard KSE, \\"MEH!\\"  There seriously seems to be a lack of heart in this album.  I have been listening to KSE since I first heard My Last Serenade and When Darkness Falls back in 2003.  The breakdowns aren't there.  The production sucks.  It is just missing that entire gritty element that made KSE so great.  It's not completely horrible, but it took a lot of listening and comparing going back and fourth from different speaker set up, iPod in the car, computer set up, headphones...every time it comes to this album while I am listening to all the other KSE stuff, this one just comes up short.  Just my opinion.  Can't wait to see the haters come out of the wood works to tell me that I am seriously wrong on this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game may be just for fun but it is awesome!!!!  In survival tu get to fight monsters but you know what I like best?  creative you get to make whatever you want for exxample I am currently working on a castle.  Once again monecraft rocks!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app has improved since it's Inception. Would recommend to my friends who love games and horses. Yay for the app.
B00866JL96|4.0|I find anything Nicholas Sparks writes to be very entertaining.  Sometimes his books end up with a different ending in the movie.  You can always expect a good &#34;chick flick&#34; from Sparks.
0575096624|2.0|Big disappointment... I only read some inserts and the reviews on the book, it's enough to know<br />not to waste my time or money on the book.  I sure hope the television show ends better than<br />the book series. Ruining Eric was the clincher, check out some of these other reviews that<br />have been written by people that were sorry they read the book, period. Even the Twilight series ended better.<br />BUMMER!!!
B004EPYZP8|4.0|A surprising end to this movie.  I didn't think I would like it, but ended up really enjoying it.  Probably one of Matthew McConaughey's best performances.  Very entertaining.
0736083863|5.0|Provides an in depth explanation of most of the common beginning, intermediate and advanced Pilates exercises.  Very good illustrations.  The book can be used as a guide to creating personalized Pilates workouts.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|A great British soap opera.  The clothing and the elegance of that period is fascinating to watch.  I can hardly wait until Season 4 arrives on PBS.  It's a great way to escape and watch something entertaining.  I didn't start watching the series until the end of Season 2 and really missed a lot by not seeing it from the beginning.  After buying Seasons 1 & 2, it filled in a lot of blank spaces.  The acting is superb, especially Dame Maggie Smith.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you are a fan of sci-fi, video gaming, and 1980s pop culture, this book is perfect for you. Even if you are none of these things, the book can be utterly engrossing. A very well written, imaginative book that can touch the soul of anyone who has a hint of being an obsessive geek.  Well done!

B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Finally a supernatural romance movie that has a little more under the surface except cliches kissing scenes with vampires.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />I give it four out of five stars because it seemed like an awful lot of information to squeeze into one film and sometimes it felt like the director was not doing a great job of keeping up.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Just like the first game except more things added to it.  You can no longer play as the zombies.  The only problem I had with this game is the fact that you need gold.  You can level a couple of times with silver, but most of the time you'll need gold.  This is my favorite game despite it limiting me for being a free player.

Recommend everyone should have one wheather it be for pleasure, reference of business.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my grandson who was 5 at the time. He loved the game, but it was too difficult for him to put together on his own. It was even a little frustrating for his dad at first. Fun game, but have patience putting it together.
B00AXOPK6W|5.0|Of course we have all heard of the book.  Some of us have seen the hundreds of made for TV mini series that have filled the airwaves for years.  None that I have seen does justice to the book.

8184776217|5.0|Although I'm giving 5 stars, I won't call this book or series flawless, but despite some occasional cliche and repetition, I was gripped by Catching Fire and Mockingjay like I haven't been gripped by a book in a very long time.  For years I've tended to pick at my books, only reading a handful of pages a day maybe on a lunch break or something, frequently having multiple books going at once, but never diving completely into just one.  But something about this story grabbed me and wouldn't let me go, and I completed Mockingjay in a single day.  I haven't done that since my school days.<br /><br />I really appreciate the messy ending.  I think a lot of people wanted and expected everything to be wrapped up nicely with a bow on top, but when you go through the kind of trauma these characters went through, you don't just get better because you \\"won\\". These characters genuinely grow and have to come to grips with what has happened to them, and though they learn to cope in their ways, they can't just sweep it all under a rug and call it a day.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The latest updated ruined a great app. What were you thinking?  I will be uninstalling this app as son as I find a better replacement which should not be difficult.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This app is my sons favorite but  it does not work on the Nabi Tablet. After a few minutes of game play its starts breaking blocks continually while moving. This is on the full paid version purchased from the Amazon App store. The tablet is up to date as is the app.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I wouldn't say this is the worst the way some feel.  Charlaine Harris's talent as a writer is still evident in the way she uses words and describes things (and at times, the humor is intact).  But yeah, it seems like she's burnt out on the series at this point and is just wrapping it up because she feels pressure to.  I wish she had felt she could have taken a break or simply not ended it, as hard as that would have been for fans, rather than publish this.  As others have said, the last three books haven't been nearly as good: less polished, less emotionally satisfying, less a lot.  The plot is pretty bad in this.  And I'm not at all pleased with who she ends up with but I will say I loved the last two paragraphs, where Sookie says something important about her sense of herself, rather than having everything rely on her relationships.  I'm going to try to not let this poison my enjoyment of the first books in the series, because they were really funny, really sexy, and really perceptive at times.  10 out of 13 isn't so bad.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Easy read and definitely a page turner. Looking forward to reading the remaining books in this series. Perfect read for those who enjoy shorter novels
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Seemed to begin a little weak but I was really caught up after a few episodes.  Had a hard time appreciating the lady agent at first.  she is hard core but more than capable.  Mandy Patinkin is a favorite of mine and is the initial reason for buying the series. Looking forward to season two.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I had some difficulty in finishing this book . The author's other books I could hardly put down .<br />The author gave a lot of insight to the characters but there was not much of a story
B0000041A9|5.0|Wonderful performances of these pieces.  Musicianship, tempi, performance practice all well done. Comfortable music for an evening or quiet day.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|A brave decision to inform the world of the facts involved in storming the bin laden compound in Pakistan. Seriously different to the political spin that i had formerly perceived. Well done Mark Owen!

1594744769|4.0|Slow start picks up about half way thru and is very engaging by the books conclusion.  It is interesting how the author entwines the photos into the story.  A very interesting use for the forgotten histories of these photos.  Kudos to the author for giving them a new life.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|It is not very responsive,  It is very difficult to see where the cubes are going to land,  I would not purchase again.

B00C81LYH2|4.0|I can't wait to see my granddaughter's face when she opens the box and starts playing with holiday Barbie.<br /><br />My graddaughter is age five and dolls and their clothing are one of her favorite areas of pasttime.<br /><br />The lovely dress and glamorous look of the doll makes it a fun item either to add to childhood games or to begin a collection.<br /><br />Barbie's outfit is silver in color and stands out either in the gift box or as a play toy.<br /><br />The dress has a glitter to it and this also serves to catch a child's attention.<br /><br />I notice that the recommended age is older than my granddaughter but as I see her play with her dolls, this certainly fits someone her age and with her interests.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|This is the first book in a series featuring Harry Hole, a flawed alcoholic detective from Oslo, Norway. Unfortunately for us Americans, we had to read this series in reverse or out of order.  Hole (pronounced holay, rhymes with ole') has been sent to Australia to assist in finding the killer of a Norwegian citizen.  Nesbo is a first rate writer who has just gotten better.  Although this book is fine as a stand alone, once you read it, you will probably be rushing to read the next one in the series.<br /><br />There is some Australian culture shock for Harry, but Nesbo never lets the geographical descriptions get in the way of the plot.<br /><br />As Harry and his Australian partner pursue their investigation, uncovering similar murders, they encounter a cast of characters usually found in books by Carl Hiassen or Elmore Leonard:  strippers, junkies, drug dealers, transvestites, Aborigines, hippies, clowns, psychics, and gorgeous females -  the difference, however, is that there is nothing funny about Nesbo's characters.<br /><br />The secondary characters are downright creepy.  Nesbo's clowns are the kind found in nightmares, not under the big top.  Nesbo's writing is dark and victims do not show up with single gunshot wounds or dead from poisoning.  There is violent death in this series... Definitely no cozy here.  The ending of this book simply screams:  MOVIE!!!  Hollywood?  Hello?  When you were casting Tom Cruise as a 6'4\\", 240 lb., all muscle former military policeman, you could have been casting Daniel Craig as Harry Hole!<br /><br />If you are not familiar with this series, lucky you!  You can start with this book and work through the series and by the time you finish, there may be a new one ... The rest of us have to wait awhile for a new Nesbo.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is really really awesome it's no ordainary game it is am extrodanary game you get to do fun and extranangant little missions sooooooooool cooooooooooooool in one run so wicked I knows right peace out
B009NF6IPE|3.0|The theme is really interesting, and the book is well written, but there are too many details.<br />The main person really wants to find her mother.<br />When she at last has the possibility to meet her, she suddenly is not interested. As a reader ,I was disappointed aboout last part of the book.
B004WO57E4|5.0|although i receive this game a little later than I expected, but the product works great and the price is very reasonable for that it is pretty much impossible to find the classic heroes 2 and 3
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this show. Have seen all seasons.  Excited for Season 4 to begin and see what's in store for Downton Abby next.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Too confusing and didn't know that it cost money, so I canceled it. Should have read the reviewed before loading it.
B00B5AIB14|1.0|First, I must say that I love the original album. I would give it a 4 stars, but rate it 1 because this Deluxe boxset is a total joke. Is someone sleeping at Universal? Who approved that project? The concert is not even complet as two songs are missing. Universal could have used the empty space on the first disc or AT LEAST replace Smile Jamaica with one or two more bonus tracks from that area. There is quite a lot of things that could have been included on this. The best choice would have been to include RASTAMAN LIVE UP (original mix from 1978) and BLACKMAN REDEMPTION (original mix from 1978). Another good addition àcould have been the unremix version of I KNOW A PLACE and WHO COLT THE GAME (both recorded in 1978). The latest was included on the double CD of One Love-The Very Best in 2001. If Universal didn't want to give anything new to the fans they could simply have included IS THIS DUB, SHE'S GONE (dub version), SUN IS SHINING (edit version) or TIME WILL TELL (1981 Alternate Mix) (included on the Countryman Soundtrack). Here is a few gems that are still hiding in the vaults and that are being circulating among fans: SUN IS SHINING (dubplate), RUNING AWAY (dubplate), MISTY MORNING (dubplate 1), MISTY MORNING (dubplate 2), I KNOW A PLACE (dub version), WHO COLT THE GAME (dub version). EASY SKANKING (monitor mix), KAYA (monitor mix), IS THIS LOVE (monitor mix), SUN IS SHINING (monitor mix), SATISFY MY SOUL (monitor mix) (five different versions), SHE'S GONE (monitor mix), MISTY MORNING (monitor mix), CRISIS (monitor mix), RUNING AWAY (monitor mix). Come on guys, this is by far the weakest Deluxe Boxset released in the Marley catalogue.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Easy reading and very interesting! Saw Eben Alexander on Fox News and ordered the book. Learned a lot from it!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy the relationship that has developed between Sherlock and Watson. Holmes' talents are amazing. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Sherlock Holmes sagas.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I have ordered these in the past....this one is very cheaply built....it does not have the good power of the first ones. This one falls apart every time I use it.  I put the battery on a much older one and it had twice the power.  Now the newer ones have less time for the battery life.  WHAT A SHAME
B004132HZS|5.0|A totally different perspective of the Holmes sagas. I like to compare and contrast between this one and Elementary. Love the British accents and after having just visited London, enjoy picking out places that I recognize.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|AVTECH DVR (rtsp) setting works with my Amazon purchased CIBR401M60A 4 CH Security DVR. My DVR show on screen when it is being accessed by a remote user.
1594746036|5.0|This book is a very good book. The plot is based around a vacation and finding out who Jacob really is. There are some surprises in the book, some profane language- just to notify you. It is a very good book- overall, with a great ending!<br /><br />I cant wait for the second book of this series- Hollow City- which comes out Jan.14.2014.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This was a good second book. Though I have to say the only reason I continued on with the series is cause I peeked ahead to see if the author was going to \\"Fix\\" the issue I had with the last book. I found the main fighting scene to be just on the border of being too long and have a feeling that when the HUGE battle comes (I suspect there will be one) I just hope it doesn't go on and on... that all said. The characters were still fun to read and kept me at a quick pace.
1400032717|3.0|No comment in either direction, I somehow ordered two of these in my earnest to make sure my son had it to read for the summer, so I'm stuck with two at the moment...........
0553062182|5.0|Found this book mentioned in an article, and immediately wanted to buy it. Elaine Aron has written a comprehensive and thoughtful overview of this important subject. As a highly sensitive person who didn't know &#34;what was wrong with me&#34;, I found comfort and understanding as well as practical ideas in this well-written book. Thank you, Elaine!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this app game! Not only is it fun it's free! I would gladly pay to play though, a long as the price is reasonable???
0767903374|4.0|After reading the book, I wanted to try working through the exercises in this workbook. I found them illuminating and encouraging - I learned a lot more about my sensitivities and how to help myself in better ways.
B000002L7Y|5.0|Haunting High and Low was the debut album of Aha. This album launched there two biggest hits with Take on Me a USA number 1, and the Sun Alwas Shines on Tv a number 20 in USA. I think that the sun alwas shines on tv is the best song on this album, It should have been a number one hit for Aha along with Take on me. The sun alwas shines on tv is the best song of the eighties, no its the best song ever made. All the songs on this album are good, and its a must have for people who love eighties music.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It is like any other game that you would play daily, but it is almost a necessity to purchase items with actual money in order to play. I am hardly getting by, but I love the challenge.
B00957T6X6|2.0|I was, at first, engrossed with the tales of the family that I took to be the heroes of the tale.  I became disenchanted along the way and by the time I'd reached book five, I quit reading half the way through disgusted and refusing to waste anymore of my time on story threads that seemed to always languish and fall into Martin's twisted (to me) good equals stupid, women equal stupid and (for the most part) weak, heroes never prevail story lines.  Sorry.  I really wanted to like this, but when you kill and/or thwart all my heroes over and over again, I just don't want to read anymore.  Too bad.  Also, if it matters, they are way too wordy.  Martin's books remind me of what happened to Robert Jordan's  &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; book series over time. Another sad loss.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|I am unable to really evaluate this app.  It was located in the apps for the Kindle Fire HD so I assumed it would show up on my device even though it indicated as an android app, but it's never turned up.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Why did you change this. It is useless to me now. Before I could find out the weather in my area and in places that I would be going but now I can't. You really MESSED up something that was good and replaced it with something that is a mess.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong has been one of my favorite games and this one is no exception. Like some other series of this game I've played it takes a little time getting used to the different set-ups and the different tiles.  I've only played two games so far but I think I will like it.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My grandchildren love this. It has been lots of fun for the 3 of them. A 7 year old and two 3 year olds.There are lots of parts to blow up.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Not many movies put out by Hollywood with a good and interesting plot line, but for Bruce Willis fans this is definitely a hit.  Looking forward to RED 2 and hopefully more!!
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|Great item, well made. This is a hot item & kids love it. Great movie also. Great gift for birthdays & Christmas. Great Action Figure!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Plot lines are good - too bad 2 main characters choose to not come back for next season, will be missed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so so much fun I like it so if you have completely nothing to do this is the game to play its very fun.:)!!!!!!<br /><br />I love this game really much<br /><br />FMOIG@mirainpink<br /><br />Look me up on Facebook jameura Jackson<br /><br />look me up on Twitter itsrealmira<br /><br />Follow me and add me as a friend
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game in my opinion is amazing because there is multiplayer and lets me use my imagination also i play the pc version and xbox edition and now i play the ios edition and no matter what edition you play i guaranty that if you have time and patience you will enjoy this game
B00BC24NT4|5.0|This one delivers in all the ways I have relish his offerings. May have too much of a message for some but I would hope you get past it - you can't quibble with the power of his storytelling.  This is one of his better pieces and amazing that he keeps giving us these gifts.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I am a huge fan of J.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and of Peter Jackson's rendition of these classics on the big screen. Therefore, I had high expectations for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, another movie adaptation of a Tolkien classic --The Hobbit.<br /><br />The movie was good. The magic of Tolkien's rich story-telling was evident, as was Jackson's spectacular cinematography and special effects. I was captured by the plot and the characters. In particular, Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman were superb in bringing life to the main characters of the wizard Gandalf, and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, respectively. The portrayal of the conflicted hobbit, Gollum, who had been horribly corrupted by the ring, was riveting. The magic of Tolkien's genius in weaving an epic story of good vs. evil was clear. The heroic and the good coming from a most unlikely source--the humble, peace-loving, unassuming Bilbo Baggins--was heartwarming. The villains were villainous and terrifying; their demise a cause for cheering. All these elements were present in this movie, and appreciated.<br /><br />But as good as The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was, I expected more. There were a few distracting elements, perhaps magnified by the otherwise brilliant storyline and film. But there they were. The buffoonery of the dwarves--major players in this movie--was at times annoying, like a part overplayed. On occasion, the dwarf king Thorin, noble in character and demeanor, seemed almost comically out of place amongst his cohorts and this did not lend itself well to his character or the gravitas that certain segments of the storyline demanded. Then there was the matter of the apparent invulnerability of the good characters. Fearsome evil characters expired, seemingly by the thousands, and some evidently by the mere flick of a wrist by one of our heroes. But not so the good guys! They survived catastrophic collapses of mountains and falls from spectacular heights...only to brush themselves off and continue on with nary a scratch to show for it. Again, where this element appears, the necessary gravitas of the plot is compromised.<br /><br />But perhaps I protest too much. The movie was a fair rendition of the book, and the book is a classic. Good acting is to be celebrated, as is the visual treat that the movie provides. I was entertained and uplifted by watching The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. I can recommend it as time well spent. Just don't expect it to be quite the lofty experience you get from reading the book or the one you had in watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy.rush themselves off and continue on with nary a scratch to show for it.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The writing is fine and the structure works.  What didn't work for me - the characters.  When I read fiction I want at least one character that I would want to spent more time with - even an evil one.  None of the people in this book are interesting enough to meet for lunch.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It is very nice fit.  Small & fits nice in pocket or glove box.  Nice to have another charge ready to go.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read all the Jack Reacher books and always tell myself I'll read just a few pages, but that never happens. Once I start I just cannot put the book down. Lee Child is a great writer.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this app Every day and Love it!  You're never too old to learn new words, to learn about others,  or just play around.  Also love having my Horoscope and local weather.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I REALLY LOVE the way that they give the challenges daily! They Give BIG prizes like 10000 coins and 50 gems... REALLY worth it!!
B00BHMETKC|1.0|I had until 7/25 to view the movie but on 7/20, when open to watch the movie, the trailer was only available.  I know I didn't rent the trailer for $3.99.  The notice above the movie stated I had until 7/25 to watch the movie but when I pressed 'Watch Now&#34;, only trailer aired. After trailer, the notice was gone replaced with a &#34;buy It' sign. I  hated the process and want a refund.
B00571F26Y|3.0|The studies cited and conclusions drawn are a little weak, and the author seems to jump to the conclusion that wheat is the problem for a whole host of diseases.  Nevertheless, the author makes a pretty compelling case against eating wheat, at least the modern form of it.<br /><br />According to the book, elimination of wheat has a wide range of health benefits.  To lose weight, however, the book recommends you eliminate or severely restrict intake of other carbs too.  So you are pretty much back to Atkins.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is so easy to get &quot;hooked&quot; on.  easier to navigate with more options than ever. love this game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book a lot more detailed then the movie was. Whoever liked the movie should really read this book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app makes access to eBay very easy and the plenty of fun when you get on the site with ease.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Very cool kit.  It is great that Lego is listening to it's user base.  At just over 400 pieces it's definitely a fun kit to build and I hope there are more to come.  I'd actually like to see the train from the 3rd installment.  The MSRP of this kit is $34.99 so it is priced just right for a 401 piece kit.  Great value.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son plays this game almost everyday and he loves it, he keeps trying to get away from the monsters and collect all the coins he passes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love playing with the little minions. Goes quick. Lots of fun things going on in the game. Love the pictures as you are running through.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like that the game is easy for anyone including a child of any age to play.<br />This game is great to help relieve stress.
148951418X|3.0|I have been using GoPro Cameras for a while now and wanted to expand my knowledge base. After reading the book cover to cover, I realized this book is mostly for those that are brand new to the GoPro cameras. That being said, it's well written and well illustrated with easy to follow directions. I did get some handy tips on time lapse video. There is a lot of info on the various mounts that GoPro offers and when to use them. I would recommend this book to anyone just starting out with a GoPro.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My son loves the game especially trying to get Victor for the bad things he did in the movie and in the game.
0525952926|5.0|This used book looks like new. I have yet to finish the book since it is fine print. Thanks for the fast service!
B005OP7162|3.0|I found this tv show to be somewhat predictable....a few episodes were exciting, but the rest felt like, 'been there, seen that done before'.....
0451232852|5.0|This is the next book to read. Great story, but being in fine print, it's going to take me a while to read it.
0385349947|5.0|I appreciate that Sheryl told many of her personal anecdotes from her career in that showed that even though she was qualified for the positions she had, there are still some insecurities or cultural habits that may hold you back from being your best.<br /><br />I found myself identifying with some chapters, like Sit at the Table, but not others.  But I think that as I move through my career I will find myself identifying with other chapters.<br /><br />Great quick read that got me thinking. Also it got me talking to friends and collegues about their reactions to the book and their missteps at work that may have impacted their career. I learned about their lessons. Great way to connect with people.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Just absolutely breathtaking special affects, and a good wholesome storyline.  Very much enjoyed this film.  Sound was spot on and hd streaming was very good quality

B00000D9TQ|5.0|I grew up listening to Phil Collins on the radio and, even though some of these songs are still played on the radio, it's great to hear all of these hits together.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|You bounce your way through the forest collecting gems and bananas. Once you pass up a gem you have to go back and play the board again to find out what passage you've missed. Collecting all the bananas is tough. This is a Mario type game. Both my fourteen and seven year old have gotten into the monkey madness of this game.
B00009VTX8|5.0|I have been watching reruns of this movie for several years and always something happens before the end. (Like the phone rings, I get called into work or the family arrives home and wants attention. This DVD was inexpensive and worth purchasing so I wouldn't have to keep missing the ending. - Oh, and I'm not going to spoil it for you by telling you the ending!
B001JIHGO0|2.0|We never got a chance to finish watching the movie because Amazon Streaming stopped working on my Roku.  What happened?
1401924751|5.0|The Life Purpose Oracle deck is definitely very specific however I found it to be a great addition to my other oracle cards.  I have officially marked this deck #2 in my collection, the cards are not only beautiful to look at but resonate with a beautiful angelic energy.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Couldn't wait to get this and it did not disappoint. We've watched this 4 times already. Crank it up and enjoy.
B008220BLG|4.0|Great new take on a zombie movie. Refreshing love story with a good moral and even some good humor. great flick I definitely recommend it.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was pleasantly surprised how different it is from the book, and in my personal opinion, it is magnitudes better.<br /><br />For those curious, the movie really doesn't run alongside this book at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg subway surfers is awesome. I luv thy game. I recommend it to everyone. It might be a little bit complicated.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My family loved this movie.  It is the first movie that my young daughter will quietly sit through the entire movie.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I really enjoy the Once Upon a Time series. The writing quality is great, and once I start watching, I can't stop.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I picked up this book, after reading a few reviews that it isn't just for young adults.  I guess seeing LeBron reading it helped a little, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />The book spends a little bit of time setting up the world to the user, but I found this to be ok and interesting.  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a little of post-apocalyptic or bizarre parallel universe stories.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Liked the old app, it was easy to read, navigate and understand. This updated one is ridiculously complicated. Going to try The Bug .
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 6 year old grandson loved the movie, as did I.  FYI - Despicable Me 2 is great, too, so when the sequel becomes available to download, I would highly suggest doing that also..
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|The version filmed in '82 seemed to have more going for it in terms of suspense, horror, and plot.  This was a computer enhanced lame-fest.  Yawn.
B002VCR03A|5.0|I love sci-fi books, and Graceling is one of my top five books ever - I have even read the entire book a second time. The epic scene where Katsa and Bitter-Blue fight for their lives against all odds - (I won't spoil this beautifully moving account of how the human spirit can soar to unbelievable heights when asked to)- is one of my secret weapons to face life. Every time life is really bleak I return to this scene and reread it. It inspires me to get off my sorry butt, to put my I-AM-WOMAN battle-gear on, and to bravely battle and conquer what needs to be dealt with.<br />I also think this book will make a riveting film.<br />And sadly....a great pity Cashore's second two books are not as spell-binding as her debut novel....
B00005Y1UX|5.0|I ordered this movie because Robert Redford is in it.  I don't care for either Woody Harrelson or Demi Moore but they both fit these parts very well.  It is certainly a different type of story and you don't know how it's going to end till you are there.  I think they could have done without all the explicit sex scenes between Harrelson and Moore especially since they show you nothing of the scenes between Redford and Moore but it's a good movie.
193700788X|5.0|I love everything Ms Harris writes, I am devastated that she has decided this book will be the last of her books on he travails of Sookie Stackhouse, I've already begun retreading the series!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Like the up to date information. Think it's a little harder to navigate through the different locations I keep up with.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Difficult to write review; something is wrong with the dialog box.  Anyway...  Fun and somewhat challenging.  Nice graphics.  Glad I tried it!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This was a great season of Doctor Who. This was a season of humanistic compassion, which at seasons past was a little unique. A good watch for fans.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The product itself is fine...but...it took a long while to get into the book, and the ending was very disappointing.  Can't say more, or I might give it away!
B009XY97VC|5.0|i fell in love with this album the moment i hear it, its just so creative and perfect and the instruments are candy to the ears i ll give 5 stars
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This series is a terrific series for young readers such as myself. I cannot wait for October when The House of Hades makes it debut!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I really enjoy this game, however, it tends to freeze up and I have to start over.  Lives run out quickly.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Wow, awful. I hated this book, or what I read of it before chucking it in the waste basket. I've seen better prose by a first grader. I've read more interesting pamphlets on microns. The only thing incredible about this book is the quality level: complete and utter filth! It takes great restraint to not use foul language in this review.<br /><br />I did find something of interesting when looking for similar titles on Amazon, a small gem called Paradise: [[ASIN:B00DZX39BG B00DZX39BG]]<br /><br />It's a really awesome, quality erotic novel. I think, given some time, it will become a classic of the genre. If you want something fascinating and of quality in the genre, read this instead.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I was disappointed that game will not let you finish clearing tree after you get to a certain point even after buying extra game with points
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Obviously, I'm not a fan. I wanted to like the book. I thought the premise was interesting. But getting down to it, I've seen better prose by a second grader. That's no exaggeration.

B003VANOFY|4.0|got the headset pretty quick, first glance, its beautiful. first fit on, fits wonderfully and is extremely comfortable, i use it to talk with friends on ts, when in game i often forget i have the thing on. sound is a little cracky every now and then when i need to charge it,
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Needless to say, I'm not a fan. I wanted to like it. I gave it my best shot. I believed the hype. I thought the premise was cool. But actually getting down to it, I've seen better prose by a fourth grader. That's no exaggeration. I've read more interesting pamphlets on teeth. The only thing shocking about this book is the quality level: total and utter trash! This is time I won't get back and I only was able to hammer through the first half. The absolute boredom! The hours wasted! That's a piece of life I will never get back!<br /><br />I did find something of note when looking for similar titles on Amazon, a small gem called Paradise: [[ASIN:B00DZX39BG B00DZX39BG]]<br /><br />It's a really entertaining, quality and steamy erotic novel.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is one of the best and addictive game I have ever play on my kindle and I would recommend it to all the people is interested in playing it.
B005K17RU0|1.0|the constantly flashing neon ads make this app unusable. try The Weather Channel, I like the improvements they made to their app
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I got the game and it was flawless<br />There are no issues<br />I already have completed half of the endings in the game.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Seriously, I was reading this at every available moment.  I LOVED the story line, the characters, the vivid descriptions of the circus, everything.  It reminded me of the movie The Thomas Crowne Affair, but with a circus instead of art.  FANTASTIC.  I've recommended it to all my friends.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I do not like the redesign. Period. I'm just not sure why it was redone. I guess  they think they need to update every so often.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|We just found this tv series and needed to catch up before season 4 started! Perfect considering we have another season to go!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Not a bad time killer.  i have played a lot of free games much worse than this in.  Definitely worth trying
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It was more updated then the item originally received with my Kindle.<br />Also the cord is longer for easier charging
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have had this app since the first day I got my kindle fire. I will be deleting it now because your &quot;new &quot; updated version sucks. Thanks so much for the extra adds and promotions.  They are obtrusive. Why did you have to screw with a simple app?  It's not an improvement.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is fun to play the and the only thing that could make this game better is more stages.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie!<br />I don't like Amazons requirement on number of words used though, six,five,four,three,two one... and now they want three more...!<br />The star rating is plenty you know...
B00005N5RM|5.0|Great movie, love the way it looks and cover is nice. The movie it self is a nicw remake and I really like it, very fun and 80's like.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|Very well done.  Her voice was equal to what we got from her in the immediate post-ABBA period.  My favorite track was #10 - her own composition.  Too bad she did not contribute her songs during the ABBA period. Recommended for any Agnetha fan. You won't be disappointed.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Awesome! will buy as a gift for family members. i have enjoyed all the products i have purchased from Amazon

B00CS74W0C|4.0|The three books are good but i find the author is stretching it a bit...i guess 4-5books is better than 3  to bring the  money in.  Not sure if I'd buy the fourth book :-\

B0017I91LI|5.0|One of the finest performances from one of the finest actors of all time. Daniel Day Lewis never fails to impress me. The back up cast were all solid as well. There is really nothing bad to be said about this movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love that you get to play in different rooms and that you receive trophies, etc for the work that you put in, it is not just a game to say that owe, I am doing something, I am playing a game.  The app rewards you for playing, I love that.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie was amazing. at first I didn't think I would like it. but it surprised me. hugh jackman and Russell crowe did an excellent job. I thought that they should of gave ann Hathaway more screen time to tell her characters story but she did a good job. and they also should of gave Amanda seyfried the same. she also did a good job. this movie is basically about a convict (Jackman) who is realeased from prison and is given a second chance after he stills some silver from a bishop who has token him in. and he meets fantine and helps her out by taking care of her child when she passes away. menwhile a police officer javert(crowe) who is hunting down hugh jackmans character because he broke paroll. and in midst of this there is a revolution going on to. this movie is somewhat depressing. but the acting is phenomenal and the sining is great. there is not much dialogue they pretty much sing the whole story which works for this movie. there is a reason why this won best picture. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|&#34;Choose Yourself!&#34; is not a self-help book. It is a wake-up call to an American audience toiling away at lives that could be enriched and vastly improved. James Altucher knows how to hone in on what the majority of us are thinking, worrying about, obsessing over, etc.<br /><br />He himself experienced many of the hardships we all do on an every day basis, and he outlines his trials throughout this book. By connecting his mishaps and downfalls with the reader he humbles himself, but most importantly reassures the reader that our problems, though they may differ in context, generally result from the same exact insecurities. Even better, through many anecdotes he reveals that our seemingly different problems can all be absolved with the same clean, simple solution. Breaking away from the confines of what we think we should do and instead choosing ourselves to identify what we know we want to do and will make us the happiest.<br /><br />James doesn't tell us anything new, but what he does do is he manages to bring out our best person, he lays the answer out in front of us, the answer we know can solve all of our problems but that we ignore for a multitude of reasons. He makes readers believe in themselves, and inspires a true transformation of the human form.<br /><br />Without a doubt, following the suggestions in this book will improve anyone's life. Will it make you a millionaire? Possibly, but even if it doesn't it will still help you love yourself a little more, as well as those around you. &#34;Choose Yourself!&#34; creates a sensation within you that screams at you as you read it, nagging you to follow through with the advice, to better yourself and to disregard the potential failures you anticipate happening along the way.<br /><br />I am an extremely frugal person. I am terrified of money. I always told myself I could run a business, but always told myself I would never do it because the investment is terrifying, and if I failed I would never pick myself up off the ground. I now have the confidence I never thought I would to give myself more credit and to invest my time improving my life and hopefully others.<br /><br />Some people may research James prior to purchasing the book just like I did and think, &#34;This guy made millions, it's easy for him to tell us what to do and make success sound simple.&#34; This was my exact reasoning, but he wasn't born rich, he had to make himself into a success. Furthermore, despite his resounding success, it was great to hear how someone so successful struggles in the same way as the rest of us who don't have much financial security. Like I said, this book doesn't have to be about becoming rich, it can simply revolve around the idea of improving your life, and it will do just that.<br /><br />I never heard of James Altucher until he did an AMA on Reddit in early June of 2013. People asked him for basic advice, and his answers seemed well thought-out, informative, but also a bit vague. He seemed to be promoting both his book, &#34;Choose Yourself!&#34;, and his blog.<br /><br />The digital version of his book only cost $5, and he claimed he would issue a refund, so I thought, why not? I am glad I did. Admittedly, I was taken aback when I realized his book contained some of his previously written blog posts. James mentions this fact in the book himself. I suppose when the answer to something is already written down, why reword it?<br /><br />The only negatives about this book is it contains too many anecdotes at times when you wish a point would just be driven home. Also, the structure isn't perfect, but either way the reader retains the message, so it's not a terrible flaw. Finally, you may not always agree with him as a person, but that doesn't mean the message loses any of its impact.<br /><br />I recommend it. If you aren't wild about admitting to yourself that a book can change your life, then just meet halfway and say it can maybe improve it. It will, and it certainly will not do the opposite.
B00D5TASN2|4.0|(&#34;The Big Dream&#34; by David Lynch)<br /><br />David Lynch hasn't released a feature film since 2006 ([[ASIN:B0039LAPWK Inland Empire [BLU-RAY] (15)]]), but his creative impulses have now shifted toward music.  Any Lynch fans know he's always focused on the sonics of his movies, and has used music (often with his frequent collaborator Angelo Badalamenti) to great effect.  So why not albums?  Well, the question that very few people were asking was answered with [[ASIN:B005N0C0C8 Crazy Clown Time]] in 2011.  That was a fun but mixed bag of an effort, with Lynch filtering his nasal, reedy voice thkrough auto tune and vocoder, or enlisting the guest vocals of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O.  The music swung between reverbed blues rock and even synth pop, and<br />was just as weird as anyone would expect of the [[ASIN:B00A5IXYR8 Eraserhead]] auteur.  It's chief flaw was a lack of coherence, but anyone who saw &#34;Inland Empire&#34; could've told you that.  Now comes the follow-up, &#34;The Big Dream,&#34; which clears up some of these problems while creating whole new ones. Does that mean it ain't enjoyable?  Heck no.  The mystery has only gotten deeper.<br /><br />Lynch's sound palette has now settled into slow, stuttering blues rock and pop, with lots of echo and atmospheric washes of keyboard.  In fact, the sound seems to be heavily informed (perhaps unintentionally?) by Dub Reggae, with the heavy rhythms loping along at a slow, deliberate and unhurried pace.  Most folks will associate this with certain medicinal &#34;supplements,&#34; but since Lynch has been a devoted and vocal practitioner of Transcendental Meditation for many years, that seems to be a better<br />explanation.  Of course, if you're the sort who enjoys certain recreational supplements, this album may sound familiar (albeit unnecessary).  Those who want to enjoy the music without any of the side effects (legal or otherwise) will want to jump in and just sink into its peaceful, but troubling depths.  As it turns out, that can be very enjoyable, and it is, but many of the tracks flow into each other a little too seamlessly.  If you're not into TM or just prefer to be egaged while awake, this album will take a few listens to appreciate.  Since that's about the worst thing I can say about &#34;The Big Dream&#34; consider that a tacit<br />endorsement.  Oh yeah, and there's also a cover of Bob Dylan's &#34;The Ballad of Hollis Brown&#34; that, in this reviewer's humble<br />opinion, nearly equals the original, despite or because of the fact that it sound nothing like it.  Now where's the next feature film?<br /><br />Side note: if Michael Bey ever puts out an album, that is surely a sign that I am wrong and the end times are upon us.  Just<br />saying.n be very enjoyable, and it is, but many of the tracks flow into each other a little too seamlessly.

B001B6PBBK|4.0|This is a great romantic comedy movie that I found by accident and loved!  It has great characters, quirkiness and love.  Enjoy!
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|My son was so happy when he opened this toy. It was in it's original package and neatly put in a box. Great service!
0385335997|5.0|I absolutely loved the first two books of this series and was super excited to find out what happens next (especially after SUCH a cliff hanger ending of book 2!)  Well, the third book in the series, didn't disappoint! I adored this book.  Finally, after all these years, Claire and Jamie get to be together again. I was so curious to discover plot and make predictions and see if they came true, that I would never have been able to properly review this book unless and until I reread the book.  So, I began listening to the audio version (which is fantastic btw).<br /><br />In Voyager the narration of the novel changes format a bit.  Instead of being limited to only seeing what Claire sees, we are allowed, through third person narration, to find out what exactly happened during the 20 years in which Jamie Fraser was separated from Claire.  What I like about this is that even though the author allows us a substantial glance into what Jamie experiences during that time, all is not revealed.  There are still tons of surprises that Claire has to discover.  I loved getting to know Brianna better, although she seems a bit difficult to get to know, but that could simply be because Roger and her were thrown together in such a way that I did not find their love story all that endearing. I find myself liking Roger better than Brianna. Perhaps this is another reason I do not feel connected to Brianna.  And, of course, I have a new favorite character in Wee Ian!  He seems like Jamie's son, through and through.<br /><br />The setting played a major role in this book.  While I did miss Scotland, this book offered several new settings and adventures. Along with trying to readjust to each other, Jamie and Claire must deal with family drama, missing person(s) and  adventure on the high seas including a run in with pirates! There is no lack of humor and adventure, but there did seem that something was different about this book that just did not get to me the way the two previous books had.  I suppose it was that the sense of danger was removed now that I knew the series continued. I mean, Dianna Gabaldon could not mean to have Claire go back through the stones just to kill Jamie off as soon as she got there!  The love story was still sweet and beautiful as ever. Jamie is different.  There is a hardness to him that didn't exist when he was younger.  He is not as innocent as he once was and no longer sees himself as a good man.<br /><br />Overall, Voyager is a great book filled with the reunion of characters you would expect and a few you might not expect.  While it may not pack the same punch as the first two books in the series, Voyager is a solid 5 star book!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I appreciated the way it related to the emotions and the child like faith while entertaining and funny. Recommended to all ages
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a pretty sweet game. It's great for a casual study break (which is what I'm using it for) and I haven't spent a penny over the initial price, which was free. I would have paid the 99&cent; for it anyway. It is well worth the price.
1250027624|4.0|Although the DVD's have proven a disappointment (the U.K. version is missing stuff from the episodes that were broadcast in the U.S. via PBS and the episodes are missing stuff from the U.K. version), still wanted the books for my &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; collection. The book is reasonably good, pictures of the actors and pictures and descriptions of period life.
B007SGM084|1.0|This series is truly trash.  Don'y waste your time reading it. I had no idea what it was about.  I have since learned to check the storyline before I buy a book.
1250006341|4.0|Same review as for &#34;Chronicles of Downton Abbey.&#34; DVDs have proven disappointing (U.K. version is missing stuff from U.S. version; U.S. version is missing stuff from U.K. version), still wanted this book for my DA collection. Has pictures of the actors, description of period life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have this downloaded on a few devices and play it often!! Almost TOO often!! Easy, Challenging, but yet still fun!!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|A quick, easy game for kids of all ages...easy to pick up & play anywhere & everywhere...a must play for any gamer
0007466064|5.0|this book was everything I hoped it would be. The characters that REALLY interested me were left out of the last book so it was a joy to learn what had been going on with them (especially Danearys.)The story is startiing to get very exciting. Reading that Cersei is getting what is coming to her was like a victory! The only problem I had with this book was that it was only 1/2 of A Dance with Dragons. There is another half that I have to go buy. If I had know that it was only half, I would have not bought this volume. I would have gotten the full volume. Other than that, my recommendation is: Go for it. You won't be disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I went to bed with one version of the app and woke up to a new version.  Notice I didn't say New &amp; improved.  I don't even know where to start.  The map is terrible.  I have great difficulty getting it to zoom, move, &amp; &quot;play&quot; the motion of the weather systems. What happened to all of the information that I used to see on the main screen?  I also liked the feature at the bottom that used to give the allergy/pollen report.  That's now gone.  I don't need the cute little sayings about what kind of activity would be good for the day's weather.  I have had my Kindle 8 months and this is the third or fourth version of your app.  Please just stick with one design that works.  If it isn't broke, you don't need to fix it!
B00338QENI|5.0|As a practicing scientist, I seldom read books that so completely and carefully document how scientific discoveries, and the scientific method behind them, affect the lives of ordinary people.  While times have changed so that the Lacks family should expect to be treated better in this day and age, Rebecca Skloot lays out in the most personal way that moving forward we can't be too careful.  As scientists and medical practitioners we have an ethical challenge and obligation to the public and to ourselves, one we must never forget.<br /><br />I'm also proud to count Rebecca Skloot among the members of the Ram nation!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The subject is wonderfully original, I wish I had been a musician and could enjoy old age at Beecham House. The acting is great, each one in his special part and one never tires listening to the musique and the voices. The Rigoletto Quartet has a perfect framing.

B0086700CM|4.0|This game is alright the first couple of times. More of a game to help time pass than one to actually enjoy. Not bad though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much! I mean, I couldn't get the pc version to work on my computer because for some reason my computer doesn't like Java, so when my sister get this version, I decided to download it from the Cloud and BAM! Instant addiction. This is an app that deserves more than five stars! Minecrafters, get this app!
B00005ATZT|5.0|I heard about this movie in one of my criminal justice classes.  It was actually really great! I think it is a must see for everyone for sure. Very interesting.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|After the disappointing Tim Burton version of Planet of the Apes, my expectations were pretty low for the franchise going anywhere interesting. Along came Rise of the Planet of the Apes two years ago and I couldn't have cared less. Reviews seemed to run fairly positive though mostly they were the \\"it's a lot better than I expected\\" variety. I'm not sure that really means a movie is any good. So I passed it by until I saw it this year on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The story follows Dr. Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist working on a miracle drug that will restore and improve brain function. His motive is revealed fairly early--his father has Alzheimer's Disease and is rapidly deteriorating. Rodman's drug is tested on chimpanzees and seems to be working well. He's about to present his star chimp, Bright Eyes, to the company's board of directors to convince them to approve human trials. Her handlers have problems; she breaks free; she tries to escape. The chase through the building is exciting and ends when she crashes through a wall monitor onto the board table and is shot by security. As you might guess, the drug is not approved for human trials. The CEO orders all the trial monkeys to be put down, including the post-mortem-born son of Bright Eyes. Dr. Rodman can't bring himself to kill the baby chimp. He takes the chimp home and raises him in secret while he restarts his drug research.<br /><br />This all happens in the first five or ten minutes of the film. The movie keeps up the brisk pace as the chimp (named \\"Caesar\\" by the Shakespeare-loving father) grows stronger and smarter, eventually coming into conflict with the human world which gave him his incredible abilities. As with many science fiction films, some bits of it seem a little too improbable (like the crash through the monitor onto the board room table or the number of simians living in San Francisco) but the movie moves so fast and delivers its images so well that I found it easy to go along for the ride.<br /><br />On the other hand, the movie sympathizes almost exclusively with the apes. Caesar is definitely the star and the hero. He is smart but misunderstood; loyal but over-protective; loved but under-appreciated. He and the other apes are abused and downtrodden, so their rising up against their captors makes them look more like freedom fighters than a menace to us humans. Caesar is unwilling to kill humans deliberately and stops a group of apes from beating a person to death. He has more compassion than most of the humans have for the monkeys or for each other.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see if future films continue this trend, seeing the apes as the good guys and the humans as bad guys. The theme of apes being better off without humans has run through all the movies, as has a cynical attitude toward humans and their behavior. It was never quite this cynical before.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|So amazing! I had the free version and just HAD to buy the full version. It is so fun, and makes you actually think. Its not one of those stupid games where you bounce a ball around aimlessly.  And there is a point to each level. It never gets old. And when you defeat the entire game, you can start over if you want or just keep playing. So worth it!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|My first read on Kindle even though I have read my Smithsonian version of Drums of Autumn many times.  Will reread as long as new books in this series are published!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I am not sure how I feel about this game. It was free so YAY, but it was not that fun.  I played it twice and got pretty sick of it. But its not bad I guess if you are just looking to pass the time.
1451695195|1.0|I too found this disappointing. Almost to the point of medical hyperbole, the author wasted my time. I kept waiting for some fantastic revelation. I was in the end presented with several Curricula Vitae that proved nothing enlightening.  I am sure in medicine, he had a miraculous recovery, but to that end,  nothing was proved to me. I for one feel he was hiding behind those framed certificates and diplomas in his office to pad his retirement and Simon Schuster is an accomplice.

B00CX7TOOG|3.0|The film opens in 1992 with a young De Niro shooting a young Bosnian POW in the back. 18 years later Travolta with painted on hair and a bad accent is out for revenge. De Niro has become a mountain man and near hermit. The movie digresses from the expected man hunt to a cripple fight. It tosses in a few seemingly meaningless words on war and life in order to try to make a point.<br /><br />Travolta was not convincing in his role. De Niro had a few good scenes but mostly was going through the motions. There are better films of this kind out there. Even one with Steve Austin.<br /><br />Makes for an okay action film rental if you can get beyond the Travolta look and accent. Some apparent CG special effects.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.

B00BFV1JVM|5.0|These books were really excellent, however they really do need to be read as a trilogy.  I do not really understand why authors write it in the form of 3 books, when each was very short, and cannot really stand on their own.  Is it because they get paid to get something out quickly?<br /><br />Having said that, it is a great read.
B001B9DIF8|5.0|I READ THIS NOVEL IN A POOR EDITION, WHICH THIS FIRST RATE &#34;FOLIO SOCIETY&#34; EDITION IS REPLACING.  THE BOOK (AS ARE ALL OF THE F S BOOKS I HAVE) IS BEAUTIFUL IN APPEARANCE  & QUALITY.  I ENJOYED THE NOVEL SOMEWHAT MORE THAN THE GOOD MOVIE.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Personally, I loved this film!  Bottom line, I believe it came out during a bad weekend when another movie took the spotlight.  I great valued movie!  The Gals will even like the romance thrown in!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best rush game you can find and play. Fun fun fun with so funny sounds. You have to play it
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I loved the TV show.  It was another awesome Joss Whedon tale, combining elements of the Wild West, The Civil War, and Space Travel..............It TOTALLY BLOWS AWAY STAR TREK!!!!!  The ultimate tale of this MOVIE is that it was a cancelled show from FOX (on Sci-Fi) it would faired much better, and the rally cry for FIREFLY being dropped by stupid idiots at FOX prompted the MOVIE Serenity.  BUY THE SERIES, buy &#34;DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE!&#34;, then buy THE MOVIE SERENITY and sit back and watch in that order!!!  You will NOT Regret It!!!  It's the best kept secret in the 'Verse.  &#34;Love keeps her flying.&#34;  a quote from the Captn.  :)
B009A7E7SK|4.0|I liked all the details in the videos.<br /> What I didn´t like was that many times I wasn´t able to download the videos to my device, or it  was difficult to do it. Other point that I dislike was they don´t suggest you how many repetitions to do.  Thanks.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun game but didnt take long to complete. Now what??? Wait for updates on more rooms or just delete the app?
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was difficult to get through the first part of the book, but as soon as it becomes part 2 I absolutely couldn't put the book down, it was so full of detail and never  ending surprises. Great book.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was insightful, entertaining, had likable characters, and gave an insight into the world of prison life for women.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I think that this is a great way to spend some time. Just like my grandmother taught me with real cards when I was young. There are ads...but it is free and they are easy to get through. I enjoy all of the choices you have when playing ie. Random vs winning and the look of the cards.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It's Star Wars on Blu-Ray...of course it is awesome! We watched the whole series over a weekend on our big screen projector set up...incredible!
B00009R86L|5.0|The Domke Postal Strap is a great addition to any Domke bag strap (or other brands), particularly when you plan on overloading your gear bag.<br /><br />Nearly every Domke bag I have used manages to distribute weight evenly.  A great example is my F-1x bag, which, despite the amount of gear, nearly always feels comfortable. However, there are times when I load the bag unreasonably and need to lug it around on location.  That is when I add this strap.  The strap makes it possible to carry an amount of gear you probably should not be carrying.<br /><br />A welcome addition for sure.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies. We can watch it over and over. This movie never gets old. It is kid and adult entertaining. The characters are great and diverse. The message on sharing and friendship are clear. This is a Must Buy and Love!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|James Wan is a horror director that might have finally peaked with this one. His first SAW film was the best of the bunch and while Insidious had flaws, it also had some great scare moments and visuals. The Conjuring is a near perfect ghost/demonic possession movie. The scares are not cheap and they are 90% effective. A couple felt a little forced, but overall this is one the creepiest movies I have seen in theaters.<br /><br />Based on a \\"true story\\" that takes place in 1971, a family becomes the victim of some evil forces in their new house. Two paranormal investigators are brought in to gather evidence. They are based on the famous couple that also investigated The Amityville Horror years later.<br /><br />The acting is great all around from the kids and adults. I like how they didn't use any big name actors. Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are relatively well known, but thankfully no huge star power here to completely take you out of the film.<br /><br />Very little gore, no foul language or nudity in a horror movie? Believe it or not, this thing earned the R rating for pure scares alone. Now don't get too overhyped or anything. I personally didn't jump in my seat or want to cover my eyes (though many scenes are quite chilling), but plenty of people around me did.<br /><br />This is the first movie that has made me want to review it in a month. The Lone Ranger (2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars) and Pacific Rim (3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars) didn't surprise me enough to warrant my time reviewing them.<br /><br />The Conjuring is my favorite film so far this year. Let's leave it at that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In the beginning I was avoiding the game. Yup, felt a little intimidated! Lol guess who has the high score?? The game is very easy to catch onto. It's all in the eyes & finger. Love the game!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun to play. I am addicted. Play everyday to get your free bingo credits. Sign up with Facebook and for 48 hours get double everything. Great way to build up your credits. Beware, once you start, you won't be able to stop.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great. Way to get back into shape after years without playing.  Enjoying it even when I lose.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />It may take some time but I will beat the machine!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Completely enjoyed the honest, descriptive journey Cheryl took both on the PCT and in her mind.  Compelling, beautiful in its raw reality.  Highly recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game for the family. My toddler and the rest of the family is hooked to this game. GREAT!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just as good or better than the one windows came with. Hard work went into this app and it shows..You can even play it with out Internet connection which so many games make you have.I think you'll like it.
0525421580|5.0|I love this book, read it in less than a day, It's funny and extraordinarily plotted by two great and funny writers. I love John an David.
B008JFUPPI|4.0|I'll say right up front I've never seen a Men in Black movie (Will Smith leaves me VERY cold as an actor) so I don't know nor do I care if this film is similar (how many 'Hangover' type films have come out in the last few years, several of which are as good or better than the original?) but this film was quite enjoyable.  Jeff Bridges is a hoot!  Mary Louise Parker and he work so well together that I wish the movie had actually centered around them.  Not to say that Ryan Reynolds isn't good here but there a reason he hasn't become the big star that many folks thought he would after The Proposal.  He just doesn't bring enough depth to a role.  I liked the humor and the silly plot didn't bother me a bit.  Kevin Bacon's role seems a bit slight but Bacon is a very good actor who's had many underwritten roles and he knows how to overcome them.  I wish James Hong and Marisa Miller's roles had been a bit expanded but the notion behind their roles is a pretty good one.  This isn't a great film but it's a pretty good way to spend an hour and a half.  I hope Bridges and Parker team up again soon in another movie.  Recommended.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have this game on my Ipa and I love it. I am so glad to see it comes to Kindle version.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great graphics and good levels. I like a goal that needs to be reached to get to another level.  Some games only have a point system as a goal.  Boring...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it!! so much fun and very addicting:) Its a lot like temple run but even better!  you can chose different minion costumes. You collect bananas and to get buy upgrades. and nobody ever reads these anyway blab blab blab )..... you stay classy
B003TSDI0E|5.0|For a layman basic entry into the world of philosophy.  Great for the young .  The development of the book will intrigue you.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great plot and graphics. Recommend this for anyone who enjoys adventure games. Have only played free version so far but going to get full. Just got the full.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The best movie I've seen all year...raw and honest and lovely. I can't believe it took me this long to see it.
B00884GR0W|3.0|It is a copy of Minecraft and the controls are a little lame but I like that it is a &quot;story&quot;.
B00DHNAQ2Y|2.0|If you liked the original don't watch this movie.  It loosely follows the plot of the first. It has also lost all the comic relief of the original as well.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another awesome read by one of the premier writers or the genre. Please keep them coming. I love your work<br />Mike Driscoll<br />Wisconsin, USA
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a good Learning game for kids to see how it is to take care of an animal. It's a fun game as well to do when your bored.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I mean come on. So many people think its horrible but its not. Ya it doesnt have multiplayer or creepers but i like that. I like to have a realistic gae with animals and not monsters. In multi people can delete what you have. Also the world is endless. In minecraft you have very limited space but in survivalcraft its endless. You also have air hunger sleep stanima and health. Also the days are changeing. The other thing is thats the controls are easy. You can fly with a touch of a button. Much better then minecraft. Also im upset that the new update isnt up yet. I want to farm and be in a african envirment. I cant stop typeing bye. Fyi ignore the spelling errors im just 11
B003G8WI7G|5.0|The first time I ever saw Trombone Shorty and his group was on a PBS show called Austin City Limits. He is a spectacular live performer switching from trombone to trumpet to singing and he is a master. He has a strong group of musicians backing him up in particular his drummer. You have to see him perform this album in person to fully appreciate what a talented guy he is!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Big Baldacci fan and this one didn't disappoint. I can't wait to start the next one and that starts... Tomorrow.
B00DB10E2O|5.0|Along with many others, I became curious about this series after hearing about the Emmy nominations, and decided to watch the season premiere.  Once I dipped my toes into that cold water, I couldn't stop.  I finished watching every episode to date, and cannot wait to see more.  The performances are exquisite.  I particularly was taken by Robin Wright's graceful portrayal of Claire Underwood.  She is able to show a great range of emotion with her eyes, happily untouched by any cosmetic surgery at this point.  Kevin Spacey is riveting as the Congressman, and shows a character of infinite intelligence and manipulative gifts.  Evil doesn't always come with a warning label.  This is a wonderful body of work.  Thank you!
159463176X|5.0|My expectations high, I thought how could he keep his writing skill and story-telling as keen as his other two novels? Well, he did. This is a journey that is so exhausting, heartfelt and rewarding, that I'm sure it will be a favorite and a re-read. You will not be disappointed and should put this on your summer reading list!
B00B5ARKDE|1.0|Received the product today(20/7/2013), however was suprised it does not come with the Clark Kent Lego Mini-fgurine. Feel the photo showing in the product with the Lego Mini-Figurine is completely mis-leading. I felt cheated, as the reason of my purchase of this Blu-ray is actually for collecting this special Lego Mini-figurine.<br /><br />I have uploaded the photo of the actual Blu-ray received today in the Leave Packaging review for Amazon to realize this misleading sales.
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|This was a HUGE and great buy for my QOTSA collection. The art in the book is beautiful and the album is all in all great. You will not be disappointed.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is cool for being free. Pretty much like garden of time. So if you enjoyed that then you'll be good to go
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  There was never a slow moment.  The story line was very believable.  And I actually could believe that one man could do everything the father did.  Very well directed and great acting.<br /><br />Definitely too much violence for smaller children.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia corrnwell is one of my favorite writers. I look forward to each new novel she writes and read it as quickly as possible after it is published
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Star Trek is so much better on blu ray. I was so happy to see the nice red shirts so bright.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Great depiction of an old story told beautifully. The actors were perfectly cast. I love Ewan MacGregor and am always surprised by his acting. The special effects were staggering. Very realistic!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|i havbt even played it yet but its my favorite card game so if it is in the same title it haw to be amazing and cool
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Beautiful moment, but just an ok story line. Its cool have the start in black and white like The Wizard of Oz and then transition into color. Overall interesting interpretation of how The Great and Powerful Oz arrived in Oz.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Eprint prints a variety of tasks, which is outstanding.  The problem as I see it that I would like to be able to print directly from my email.  I seem to be unable to do that  with the HP printer I have. My Samsung SII is limited to print from email to only a Samsung printer - which I don't have and won't purchase one because I like the HP wireless on I have.
B00A81MV3U|2.0|This movie was very hard to get into. It was not what I expected at all. I would not recommend it unless you want to be depressed.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|It's like having an ebook, plug it into your radio select a document to review and the way you go. Most excellent - look out Siri
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This show was better than I thought it was going to be, Teenagers like it. Not really for small children. A little gross in some parts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is nice but horses are expensive and energy takes forever to recharge. I think this game needs to go back to the drawing board.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|Would like replacement DVDs or a full refund.  Very disappointed in quality.  Every season had at least one defective DVD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am ADDICTED to this game! it is a great way to challenge my mind but also a way to keep me entertained while the kids are at school and my husband is at work
0385751532|5.0|I read this book after I saw the amazing film that was made from it. Both are compelling. And I recently re-read this, as I think this is one of the more creative and gorgeous stories than can been culled from such a devastating and tragic situation. Who but children, in their innocence, could convey such a powerful message? If there is any story I would recommend to readers in their teen years and onward, it would be this.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book is nothing short of breathtaking. I am fully amazed and will refer it  to everyone. I loved it.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I live in St Lucia in the Caribbean and it only gives me St Lucia in Australia. I don't want to know what the weather is doing in the other islands or Australia. SO FRUSTRATING. and very disappointing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pleasant game.  Challenging enough to be fun, but not so much to get easily bored.  Only gave 4 stars due to the short length of the game, but it was FAOD and I guess you get what you pay for.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|drives me crazy but I cant stop playing it.  cant wait for more rooms to be added.  easy to get hooked on. great game.
B00632HWOG|3.0|If I could delete more and quicker at one time instead of the long process of selecting every email I'd give a bigger and better rating! Like all emails from $$$$ delete and they are deleted
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens next. I was a little surprised about another book coming out!  Sad I'm already finished reading it. :-)
B0061PEAUY|1.0|I guess I am not a fan of this genre, because I couldn't suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|enjoyed it ... was looking for something different and this fit the bill  I'm always looking for genre other than what I normally read
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|As someone who has lived on both sides of the U.S./Canada border, I found this tale of a young boy somewhat adrift in this situation to be quite engrossing. The writing is solid; the people and their situations believable
B0050DIWFC|2.0|As the reader, I had hoped the ending didn't lead to the obvious, so I kept reading.  Unfortunately, this book was nothing more than I drawn out Law and Order Episode. DONE-DONE!!
B004LROUW2|5.0|I hated this long and engrossing book to end.  Many of the elements of previous Murakami novels appear here in even more unusual guises.  I hope he's working on another one!
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Though the costumes of old were skirts, one could not say the men were p------!  Russell Crowe was superb, reminding me of Richard Burton in looks, Moses in determination, and an unknown quantity in valor!  It was superb!
B006FTCH2E|4.0|The ending was a real let down - I hate not knowing what is going to happen.  The movie had a great idea and a lot of emotional issues to consider.  I did enjoy it, but wish the end were more decided.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Chocolate is delicious now, will continue to be, and was in the past.  This movie was subtle, yet direct.  The scene of absolute rape in the chocolatier reflected Thomas Moore's &#34;The Soul of Sex&#34; superbly.  Loved it!  Makes me want chocolate right now!
1616550414|5.0|This book is utter perfection. Truly amazing. Any Zelda fans MUST buy this book. It's quality is through the roof
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love love love love love this Game you must have it is the best u really need this please rate 5 stars
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read almost everyone of her books, and I always love them! So suspenseful with great twists and turns throughout! I enjoy trying to figure out the mystery before I get to the end of the book, which I have only done a few times. She is absolutely phenomenal at what she does!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Great book on what words can really mean...it helps when you really need it....what if you couldn't use the internet for dictionary.com or something you would need the app most people do....  :/
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I have got to get the entire Bourne set and watch them in sequence.  Put that on my must do list before my next extended trip.
B005LAJ1O0|3.0|We are late comers to this show.<br />In fact we had never even heard about it until July 2013  (when the 3rd Season was soon ready to start).<br /><br />Of course that happens often these days.<br />With so many channels and shows these days, it seems a show can be popular and be on for years yet you never hear about it while you are off watching other stuff.<br /><br />It's kind of like we all live in alternate \\"entertainment\\" universes.<br /><br />But anyway ...<br /><br />In a quirky, (sometimes perhaps too perverse) way .. the show grabs your attention.<br />It is a bit \\"over the top\\" but that is a trademark of the producers.<br /><br />The concept is an original one.<br />So it does entertain.<br /><br />Is it scary ........ hmmm,  not really.<br />I guess it is best summed up as a \\"Hard R-rated Steven King\\"<br />More of a dark, dark comedy in a way.<br /><br />The series seems to borrow very heavily from the movie THE OTHERS in this first season.<br /><br />The story in this first season should have probably only been 8 episodes long.<br />It does feel like it is \\"churning\\" mid-season as a way to fill out 12 episodes.<br /><br />All in all the acting is good, the concept is original.<br />It is well done.<br /><br />Did we enjoy watching it? YES<br />Will we ever sit and watch the whole season again ?  PROBABLY NOT<br />Will we want to add this to our DVD collection like we have other recent TV shows like DEXTER, 24 ...  NO<br /><br />I am glad we discovered it and watched it.<br />There was some good talent and effort spent to make this TV project ... but not something we will want to add to our collection or watch time and time again in the future.<br /><br />I should mention ... the last episode was very weak in comparison to the rest of the season.<br />In fact, the last episode feels like it was an afterthought that was just tacked on at the end of the season.<br />Campy, goofy and not necessary.<br />You could actually skip the last episode and the season would be a better package.on would be a better package.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Cleaver plot line that takes you around a few unexpected corners.  Sure took the edge off a 90 minute delayed flight.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|The book is well written as far as YA books go. It moves pretty fast for the first 3/4th of the book, but it should have ended (SPOILER ALERT) at the looking glass shattering after Valentine fled to Iridis. The rest of the book felt like tying up plot lines and creating the next book's. Not sure I will move forward with the series.
B00AW57L96|5.0|This book tells several stories of different people who eventually come together in the end.  It is fast moving and a very interesting read.
1476734941|4.0|Easy to read, hard to research. Most foods and menus are a little too complicated for one person living alone, and busy. But the rules are easy to follow. Would be really good if more beverage items were indicated. On fast days, I miss my OJ, my tea, my soda - but not so much to cheat. A few ideas would be helpful, as I have several food allergies that preclude artificial sweeteners and caffeine drinks. But the general program is doable, and involves foods I would be eating anyway, just in a reduced quantity.
1401223176|5.0|Love collaborations like this, true fair for a batman fan, who is always lookign for new stories to read, but has no time to wad thru the comic story every week
B0088TG252|5.0|This is a great movie, I wouldn't expect anything less from Denzel or Ryan. There was plenty of action and it was easy to follow. I plan on watching this movie many more times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game it is awesome and I love the movie to I like game it is so fun I cant stop playing it until my parents make me get of
