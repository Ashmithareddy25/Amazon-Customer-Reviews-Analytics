B00992CF6W|5.0|omg I love minecraft so much. I can't get the pocket edition because it costs money. I hope someday it'll be the free app of the day. epic game ;)
B00APJLX8E|5.0|NIce HD transmission..another family movie you can leave your grandkids to watch without the worry of hollywood trash.  Did not watch entire movie but grandchild enjoyed
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just got thjs app, and it is wonderful! And the cool thing is it's free! Although when downloading My Horse it did take awhile, but other than that it is a great app!
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Superb. More people should read. Very applicable in todays world. Would love to get more of her books. enjoy and apply the principles
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The title is all there is to say.. Batman... end of discussion. All other arguments are invalid and unjust. Buy this!
B0082SU98U|5.0|Excellent book. Principles that do not die. Wish more people, especially children, would read this inspiring and thought provoking book
0345803485|3.0|With all the hoopla about this book, I had to get a copy and find out for myself.  In the beginning it was okay, but then it just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again - to the point that I got bored and am not interested in reading the sequels.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Ok I saw both of the movies for the Hunger Games and in the second one I didn't understand why he was spitting blood into his cups when he drank something. but other than that the books and movie are fantastic
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have always loved my dogs but now I love them more... I really wish there was a sequel to this book!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really good app, if you have a iPhone like me you like to know who's long you got before it dies, this app is better than the iPhone ...
B00873WO7E|5.0|Gorgeous  blu ray steel book edition cover depicting a human baby being created by the Matrix. I've seen plenty of steel book edition covers in stores and on line. This Matrix cover is one if not the best looking one out there so far.Buy it before it's sold out.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I let my daughter download and play this. She says it is fun but not as fun as some of the other games we have tried. I like the graphics.
B0043H2V2Q|5.0|If your a huge &#34; Resident Evil &#34; fan get this steel book edition before it's sold out. It's glossy , reflective look and cold metal to the touch feel fits perfectly with the Resident Evil franchise.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I cannot figure out how to video chat on facebook with my skype acct. on the kindle. I can do it on my pc but I have not found a facebook app for my kindle that allows me to video chat. That bothers me cause I really expected to be able to do that when I purchased the kindle. Hopefully I will find a way to do this. I guess maybe there is a paid app for this? I'll keep checking.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|interestng life  to be the mockinjay. Well written, maybe there will be other characters come to life in the future.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Really it is only good as an alarm clock. I would like to have different clock faces but when you go to settings you have to upgrade it through a paid app. and I can't use any other media sounds unless I buy the upgrade. So you only have a few sounds to choose from and only the digital time display with the free app. I will sometime see if I can find a better free app to replace this one.. It does wake you up and you can leave it open on the night stand and it doesn't drain the battery so it does it's job.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|SPOILER ALERT:  Why keep going with the story once you know the fate of all the tenants of the mansion.  the filler story at the end was a waste and even more out there than the initial alien plot
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show.  I have been watching it from day one when everyone else had their doubts.  Now it is a big hit.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is a fantastic video with a surprise ending which I will not divulge, but trust me, it's fabulous.  If you're into Les Mis, you will love it!!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Cool game easy to play no glitches on kindle fire. Don't have to pay for the game don't have to pay to play either if you don't want to.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|This one was even worse than the first Ghost Rider movie! I didn't like it at all, it was just plain stupid.
B00881VLCE|5.0|LOVE THIS APP. It's about as close to doing a real life puzzle as it gets. Without buying a bunch of puzzles and having a mess!
1577314808|5.0|Great book. Take your time and do not be in a rush to digest everything. I always write in my books and review materials. Thus far I have enjoyed it.
1400052173|5.0|I am only part way through tihis book but it is a fascinating true story.  My teacher recommended it as we were in a research class.  I am enjoying it and will finish it soon.  Great read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have been playing this game for months now and love it. In fact I have 2 accounts. One of them I play fast and pay to level fast the other one I pay nothing on and go slow and let my friends in the game help.
B0000042MY|1.0|I DID NOT GET THIS SOUNDTRACT AND IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE CLOUD EITHER.WHY DO YOU NEED MORE WORDS
B0064MGU98|5.0|It's a legal show combined with a really good drama... one of my all time favorites.  Complex characters and storylines.
B00004STPT|1.0|THIS SOUND TRACK DID NOT DOWNLOAD AND IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD  IN THE CLOUD . I HAVE NOT RECIEVED THIS CD EITHER
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This game runs great on my HTC DNA, lots of action and easy to execute game play.<br /><br />I suspect I will be playing this a lot!
B002S9DRA6|5.0|i never knew how much i was missing all these years  till i heard sadeness  on the radio and then fell in love with their  music. their the best.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I find it relaxing. Great graphics and ambient music. I got it for free app of day but probably worth buying.
B00062PN6I|1.0|Maybe it was just the pair I got, but it was pretty bad. There's something wrong with the wiring so the left hear sounds a little distorted on certain songs, especially at high volume. That could have just been a problem with the pair I got, but who knows, maybe it's worth the 10 buck risk and not every pair is bad. Even without the messed up left ear, the quality wasn't the greatest either, it was okay, but you definitely get what you pay for.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie, went by so quick left me wanting more.  I can see why it has received so many awards
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Awesome movie. Done the right way. Believeable and wonderful that it's based on a true story. Really was worth my time.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book was very motivating. It shows how the smallest businesses can make a lot of money and how very specific ideas and target markets can have a lot of potential.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well, I can say that this book is a great read...for the first book.  However, (no spoilers) the ending is a complete flop. Having all three books in one on the kindle is really nice, though.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The movie is almost 3hrs long, but the pace is quick and reconstruction of events is very realistic. Overall, an awesome movie.
B007IK44CK|5.0|The best of the series and better thrills directed in this one than the recent Bond movie SkyFall.<br />If you liked Skyfall,you will love this one.<br /><br />Breath taking stunts by Tom, The best in recent times.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is perfect for the kindle, It's exactly what I wanted I have no complaints I would defenitly pay for this I highly recomend it.
B000001GQP|5.0|Carl Orff wrote an evocative choral masterpiece, taking us through the arcane world of Gothic Europe.This recording, part of the DG &#34;Originals&#34; series is a wondrous blend of superlative performance and interpretation Eugene Jochum provides revelation, drama and wit to this unique work. Fischer-Dieskau and Gundula Janowitz are inspired in their solo contributions.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book re-energizes the soul!  I have written small exerts of the text and keep them as close reminders to revisit anytime I feel I'm becoming off-balance.  I will read this book again and again.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|i enjoyed this movie when it came out in the 70's. its even better now on blu-ray, the clarity is so amazing.this is the only zep movie that shows them in there true light.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Exposed him to some great life lessons and old school arcade games. Wonderful for a four year old and his Mom.
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|This is a good album i was impressed upon first listen although i like disc 2 more than disc 1. It's better than the panic broadcast but i do like several songs on that album; i liked sworn to a great divide also better than the panic broadcast. After the natural born chaos album came out i sort of put soilwork to the back shelf til 2008 when i got stabbing the drama as a gift i liked it but not alot then i got sworn to a great divide i really liked it; suddenly wichers returns to soilwork 2 years later the panic broadcast was released it's not a bad album but i thought the guitars needed alittle more attention or perhaps a different mix of the album would have worked. Fast forward to 2012 wichers leaves again i thought okay thats it the band is done but instead they continue with a new guitarist and the living infinite comes out i was blown away by this album even though i was skeptical at first; it's their best album since natural born chaos hands down if your a fan you'll like it, if your new to this band i recommend it but not without listening to past albums first. This is a great album buy it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I love this program! Fox does it again! Along with shows like 24 and Prison Break this show delivers twists and plot lines that no one saw coming with every episode. It develops the characters well. It is a gripping story that's never been done before. Be sure to watch every episode!
B003G1EDOE|5.0|greatest album of all time. Lester Bangs wrote a decent review too. In 15 + years of album collecting and music listening I've found nothing comparable. This is the end all. If you're not ready for the end all and bored with Walk on the Wild Side, though, pick up Coney Island Baby. Underrated gem. MMM is the apocalypse. The fact that noise music has become a genre is pretty pathetic/tame. The place for it is out of left field and straight to the hell of rebellion. All thinking people should have MMM on vinyl framed in their living rooms the way other people put up grandfather clocks, crucifixes, Woolworth paintings, Picassos, watercolor pear baskets and bottled ships. Although I am a huge fan of bottled ships, and model ships in general. Beneath the framed album an abused copy of Finnegans Wake. Great things will start to happen in your life. Trust me.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Works awesome on my Galaxy Note. Great game. Lots of different planes to play. Best of all, there are no in-app purchases that I have seen so far. Unique and fun little dogfighting game. Love it.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Really well done.  This film sets things up very nicely for the next two films. The break point is well chosen.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|would recommend this highly great family  movie love it must see so scoop up the kids and pop some popcorn and have a budget friendly enjoyable nights
B000VZYPB4|5.0|There is a reason this is the number one rated show. I had never seen the pilot and had to watch that. Excellent!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and while it left a lot of questions unanswered and skipped a few things I consider important (e.g., his relationship w/ his parents as and adult), it was very well written.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The reason why I say sadness is because I love the twilight series and the movies. I just hate to see it go. I like this book because it's about romance and action. It show true love.  I recommend this book to people who love love and action. Especially for girls if you to hear about this life from a girl's perspective.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|For the first hour this is fun.  Waiting for coins wasn't too bad.  You try to drop combos just right and shake the game to get a little extra here and there to keep you going a few moments longer.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|Kept me reading, built a sense of foreboding throughout. Ending worth waiting for. Recommended for women probably, not necessarily a man's book
B008Y78M60|4.0|Anyone interested in historical dramas or unraveling mysteries should enjoy this. It's obvious I was taught only the bare outline of the facts of Lincoln's assassination. Robin Wright gives another one of her subtle and superb performances. Without it you wouldn't have cared about the outcome of the trial upon which the plot centers, and you wouldn't have remained so uncertain about the underlying mystery. One criticism is that I was unclear what was happening during the early scenes showing the wider plot to assassinate the Secretary of State and Vice President. Bone up a bit on that part of history before you watch this.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|Had the free one first, son liked it so much I bought the entire one. Has animation, is bright, and is a helpful learning tool.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it...  passes the time.  Do wish you didn't need so many diamonds to keep playing.  Both for energy and to get rid of the demons.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|It works well to enable me to keep appointments, and important dates.  I put appointments on it immediately, so I do not have to remember to write them on the paper calendar.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Very fun and addicting game at a great price! If you are immobile for a certain amount of time, this is a great game to play.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this almost every day...i love the radar on it...its one of the best ive found. it helps guide my everyday for what to expect in weather...
B004MYF4SS|4.0|I thought the book was great. It had a good story line and gave amazing descriptions about the culture and landscape of Scotland. In my personal opinion I wish there was more police investigation or thrilling details and more romance. I wouldn't consider the book a thriller but it definitely kept me guessing to the very end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is really fun. I play it a lot. It takes awhile to load but it's fun. I like it
B005LLSZNM|5.0|You know it's wrong to love and root for these characters but it can't be helped. This show never fails to surprise me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was absolutely enchanting. I read it in one sitting. Best Sparks book by far that I've read. You won't be disappointed with this one.
0765325950|5.0|I was always a fan of Robert Jordan before he started this series, so for me it has been a generation of reading the Wheel of Time, patiently waiting 2 to 3 years for each installment. A Memory of Light just might be the best one yet. Brandon Sanderson should be very proud of his work, Too me, the quality of the writing is such the the words on a page disappear and is replaced by the mental image of the story right down to the smells of the scene and the feel of the wind blowing through my hair as I bear witness to story unfolding before me. Treasure is rare so please feel free to enjoy this one.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It needs a free drive mode. But it is cool and easy. Awesomeness and the first place in the town of the first place for a car
B005K17RU0|2.0|Requires manual intervention to update.<br /><br />Old version updated automatically.  when updated it works great. Please fix this bug. or help me figure out what is wrong.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game I can never put it down!!!!!!!!! Me and my brothers always have a competition to see who is the best at the game. But I always win. Whoever came up with this game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Product is wonderful!  Just as seller described!  I use it everyday and look forward to using it every day in the future!

B000654YRY|5.0|I've had this cd for years and have played the crap out of it...didn't even know they had a DVD until recently so had to have it.  this is a GREAT SHOW!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows.  Never gets old.  Riveting storylines.  Never miss and episode and happy to be able to watch any of them on the best value on the web...Amazon Prime.
1452113432|4.0|Comfort food and easy to make recipes.  Most are easy and quick enough to be used after a days work.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Creepy,,,scary...riveting.  Best new show on TV.  Kevin Bacon is great and the cult storyline is  is so believable.  Hope this show continues to get rave reviews.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Great little puzzle game with a fun, intuitive interface. If you enjoy puzzle games and route-finding, this is perfect for you.
B00BRR66SA|3.0|The album is just okay. Only one or two songs are good. This music is better suited to be listened to on a music video. Preview the album before you lay out the $10 or $11 bucks.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I have Osmos for the computer as well - this is the same great game, now with a touch interface! It would be even better on a tablet - can be small at times on my Rezound screen. Gorgeous game, really fun gameplay - a must-have!
B009CF7GRY|3.0|This footloose was not nearly as good as the Kevin Bacon version. The actors were likable but the script was not good. It lacked originality and at times made me snore. They should have left this one alone.
B007NZQU72|5.0|This book has helped me understand that I am a normal human,<br />better understand my trait and feel more secure and proud about it.<br />I read it with great passion.<br /><br />It includes stories about highly sensitive people in love,<br />that I found very similar to my experience. This has helped me resolve<br />my feeling of unreciprocated first love, that has been with me for over ten years.<br /><br />I recommend this book to people who feel they are out of this world.<br />It will help you understand where you belong, and set you towards the<br />journey of adherence to the 'royal advisory' class.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I don't like it.<br />I want my money back. It isn't as nice as the free one. How is that good?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you liked Hunger Games and Catching Fire you will love the Mockingjay.  Each book got better and I think the Mockingjay was the best.
1609613937|5.0|I am a female, 53 yrs old, and I have never had an overweight issue so I do not eat this way for weight problems.  I simply eat this way to feel better.  It takes away the aches and pains of aging.  It's also extremely easy, and frugal to eat this way---much more affordable to eat organically.  I never have to worry about all the meat \\"recalls\\" or dairy problems that may find their way to the news headlines.  I will say that this book has made me take a second look at all the vitamins I've taken over the years and I'm now in the process of going off of all of them, even though my doctor wants me to take calcium and get a current bone scan soon.  A decade or so ago, I came up positive for osteopenia but I'd like to see my bone density improve with food alone...without adding extra calcium or Vitamin D.  Of course, I will be exercising as well and I've heard that rebounding is excellent for strengthening bones, which I've already begun to implement.<br /><br />Recipes in the book are good and easy.  My husband's only comments are \\"I'll be vegan as long as it tastes good\\".  So he is vegan 95% of the time.  Still won't let go of that occasional In N Out burger!<br /><br />I would like to attend one of Dr McDougall's seminars in Santa Rosa, CA.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game involves logic but it is lots of fun at the same time. I love puzzles and if you do too, try it. I think you will enjoy the challenge. Warning..it is addictive!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found myself liking this book more than I anticipated. The orphanage scenes, in particular, we're very well written & drew you in to the horror '& trauma that took place there. I couldn't help but root for Jamie--he deserved a happy life after all he endured & lost. A good read all the way around.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I LOVE this app! I only wish that I could save the combination sounds as presets (maybe it's available in the premium version, though?).
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|What an excellent movie. Great acting & great story.. i saw this movie again after seeing it in the theater.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very good book,many interesting threads with in the book<br /><br />It would be great to find a book listing allthe meanings of the flowers,as keeper for referance.<br /><br />Do you know if there is such a hand book available?
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Great movie, it's pretty slow but if you like the other ones you'll enjoy it. Honestly it's a buildup for the movies preceding it
111846446X|5.0|It gets you started with Raspberry Pi and demonstrates how to set up a few useful scenarios. Great reference for setting up.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I needed something to do one night and this movie was just what I was in the mood for. It was a good movie that kept my attention.
0596805527|5.0|For me, this is the end all for JavaScript books. If you are looking for something JavaScript, it's in this book.
1442339586|4.0|If you have a Y chromosome and you don't see at least some of your present or past self in here, you haven't had much fun in life.  Even as you shake your head and wonder how the half of the species with the Y chromosome has managed to survive, you have to laugh when you listen to this.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Wonderfull app, does the job, pretty, I'm only writing this much to get the required word guideline out of the way.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an amazing book! It was well written, well thought out and overall well crafted. I cant wait until the movie comes out for purchase!
B000000XB9|5.0|Bought it for a relative's birthday...it was the perfect item and very affordable.  Thanks for sending it so promptly and the quality of the product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There aren't a lot of book series that are good but this is definitely the exception!! I can't wait to read the next book! But I guess it's over after that. Then I'll be sad
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I was expecting something more after talking to friends who had read the book.  I found it a little disappointing.  The ending wasn't really a suprise or twist to me.  I did enjoy the style of the book as written.  I think what I found most frustrating was that nothing was really exposed in Jacob's inner personality.  I think that would have made the book better for me.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|A horrifying yet truthful look at humanity.  With troubles ahead for this generation and beyond, it is not difficult to imagine something like The Long Walk being a reality.  Entertainment for the masses through exploitation of the desperate and hopeless.  Makes a guy like me want to take my family and head for the hills.<br /><br />The novel is also testament to the raw capabilities of the human body and the human mind.  It's amazing what a person is capable of doing, both good and evil, when pushed to the limit.  Running a marathon for most seems impossible.  Imagine going 200+ miles, nonstop, for 5 days.<br /><br />Makes you wonder what a person might be willing to do if given a chance, not even the promise, at gaining anything money can buy.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|BBC has produced another good one! The cast is fantastic and the writing is great! The story line is wonderful and it's a a time period that hasn't really been done before.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great cast, story line, photography and direction. I cant wait for season 4. The scripts are strong and well done.  They pay such close attention to detail.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my 1st book book to read of Colleen Hoover & I loved it. I fell in love with her writing style that just pulled you in & made you feel like you were involved. Loved Sky & Holder;) if you haven't read it you're missing out!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Oh yes, when does the tv series start? Fantastic story. Action packed. Reacher is a freaking superhero! I already have the next several Reacher stories downloaded, waiting to be read.
0385333846|4.0|In 1968, after recovering from an almost fatal accident and after his wife had died, Billy Pilgrim went to New York City and disclosed on an all-night radio program about having been kidnapped to the planet Tralfamadore. So he says.<br /><br />In 1967 on his daughter's wedding night, a flying saucer kidnapped him and took him to the planet Tralfamadore. He was displayed in a zoo and mated with a movie star Montana Wildhack. So it goes.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim was born in 1922 in Ilium, New York. He graduated from Ilium High School and attended the Ilium School of Optometry. So it goes.<br /><br />In 1944, he went to South Carolina for maneuvers. He was an assistant chaplain, \\"powerless to harm his enemies or help his friends\\" Later that year, he went to Luxembourg to replace a deceased assistant chaplain just in time for a German attack. He survived but was behind the German lines. He met Roland Weary and they were captured by the Germans and sent to the extermination camp for Russian prisoners of war. So it goes.<br /><br />In early 1968, Billy and other optometrists chartered a plane to go from Ilium to Montreal for a convention and the plane crashed on top of Sugarbush Mountain, Vermont. Only Billy and the copilot survived. So it goes.<br /><br />His wife, having heard about the crash, drove to Vermont but had an accident on the way to the hospital.

0143118757|2.0|If only it went the way this book says it does, in neat steps. It's doesn't. However, there are some useful tips found in this book, so it's worth it to at least skim through a copy.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|For millions who have never seen Led Zeppelin \\"live\\" and those that missed this concert, this DVD/CD digipak is the next best thing to being there. The way to go when watching this is large-screen TV with home entertainment/Dolby 5.1 Surround. There is an excellent separation of sound with 5.1 not heard when just watching this in stereo and the experience is highly rewarding.<br /><br />Although the band has not played together for 19 years, there is definitely the old chemistry relived among Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and now, newcomer Jason Bonham. The music was exceptionally tight. Page danced and strutted with much of the same magic that he did in \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". His fingers have not slowed down at all and he demonstrated the fretboard magic that has made him one of the most influential rock/blues guitarists of all time. The very same cherry-sunburst Les Paul that Page played is the very model that he was one of the first rock musicians to popularize.<br /><br />Although more aged now, Plant's voice can still deliver and it does. People who expect to see him howling like he did 30 years ago would not be in touch with reality. He definitely has limitations but he is still the rocker that he was. The voice of Robert Plant is definitely alive in this performance.<br /><br />When I hear the opening chords of \\"Good Times/Bad Times\\" and John Paul Jones' heavy, riffing bass line, I am reliving my youth again. Led Zeppelin is one of the first bands I idolized and John Paul Jones was the first bass player that made me want to learn how to play bass. Jones' playing in this is 6-star on a maximum of 5; he plays numerous basses in this, e.g. 4-string, 4-string fretless, what appears to be a 10-string in \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\". He also undertook the keyboards in modern format on other songs such as \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", \\"Trampled Under Foot\\", \\"Kashmir\\", \\"No Quarter\\", \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".<br /><br />Lastly, Jason Bonham demonstrated the ability that he has inherited and perfected from the late John Bonham, his father. He anchored the rhythm section on drums and percussion and played all of the Zeppelin songs to the note, even singing backup on a few songs. He and John Paul Jones seemed fairly tight together, holding the lines while Page played rhythm/lead guitars and Plant sang.<br /><br />Overall, this DVD performance is one to remember. There were a few tiny glitches, e.g. JP Jones looking puzzled over at Page's guitar during \\"In My Time of Dying\\" because the sustain just didn't seem to be resonating before each verse began. Maybe one or two missed beats in the wild syncopation of Zeppelin's setlist but it was hardly noticeable.<br /><br />The Bonus DVD in this pack is sort of negligible. I really could have done without the rehearsal, where the only camera angle seemed to be from about 100 or more feet straight back. The other two sections, the \\"media moment\\", or clip from Tampa many years ago both also seemed insignificant. It would have been better to have perhaps some interviews with the band or backstage banter than this collection of clips, although welcome.<br /><br />The CDs are high-quality representations of the music on the DVD. Honestly, I was more interested in seeing the performance than listening to it on the stereo.<br /><br />The important thing is to remember that this performance was a rare gift. With a decent level of animosity that seems to be hidden as well as band members \\"busy\\" with other projects, it may never happen again. Page will be touring on a solo project this year, without the other three. There has been some talk about 2014, but realistically, the band is getting too old to consider a lengthy tour. Even if they do, the odds of landing any tickets for a reasonable amount of money would be slim-to-none. Therefore, this digipak captures a modern musical performance of a legendary band, \\"frozen\\" in time.n Bonham demonstrated the ability that he has inherited and perfected from the late John Bonham, his father.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty shades are great books, they definitely keep you coming back to read more...I would recommend them but need to be age appropriate too
034580404X|5.0|Loved these book...wish there were more to the series....I really hope that the author decides to add to the series
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It was good for the first go around... but one you finish the game, all you do is the same thing over and over...kind of boring
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game, I am addicted. Everyone in my household is playing this game, my 5 yr old grandson, and my 4 yr old granddaughter.  This game is challenging.  It should be made in an hand held game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved these books, would recommend them to the appropriate age group, they definitley had me coming back for more....wanted to finish them, in hurry to see what happened but I didn't either...lol
B005CA4SQK|5.0|totally entertaining, with lots of action and terror at the same time.<br />Each episode is full of adventure and high drama and zombies.<br />very good adaptation of the comic.
B0019IIPXQ|3.0|I am a woman.  And I truly belive every woman would love Vin Diesel.  There was nothing wrong with the cast and directing.  It's the plot and story that fall simple and superficial.  It was a great imagination and visual effect with 3 Suns around the alien planet, etc, however if the author had developed the charactors and story line further and deeper with more dimensions, it would definitely raise the bar.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game has crisp graphics and a nice challenge.  I am enjoying the mellow music as I solve the puzzles.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|I bought this app for a reason, I need to practice for my school chess club but maybe it's me but,  THIS GAME WAS NOT A GOOD LEARNING GAME FOR SOMEONE NEW AT THIS CHESS GAME!!!!  : -#
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story with love and intrigue. Once you start you don't  want to put it down and don't want it to end. Thank you for a great story. Always  wondering what I would in the same situation. Good job
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and I never get tired of it. It is also really cool how it updates every once in awhile so you can do other stuff than just the same old stuff.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|awesome...best battery app ever owned...I need to update it but other than that it worked great as a battary appbfor the kindle fire
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just started this game and so far I really like it. But I have to admit I'm only making this review to get  three free gems. :)
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I enjoyed  this book completely. Can't wait for Book 2.  Now to find something else to read in the meantime.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Great acting and story line.  I thought it dragged slightly at the beginning, but a foundation had to be built I guess.
B0074JODEY|4.0|Film is very good. All five of them. The thing is next week there were six films for the same price. I can't get the last one. Why?
0765325950|5.0|while there were some 'draggy' parts, I usually skimmed through them as I was more interested what happened with the key players of which their ends were described.<br /><br />If you have been a reader of the series, this may not rank as the very best, but should be in the top five for finally coming to a conclusion that one could live with.
B0086213XW|3.0|Why is Margot crying at the end. Didn't she get what she always wanted? Miserable woman that she is. Adultry destroys lives!<br /><br />Overall, this was a learning experience for many to learn from. Josh Groden turned in a good acting experience.<br /><br />Why fight and try to make someone stay with you when all the adulterer wants to do is leave.<br /><br />I liked the movie; didn't love it, but liked it overall. You could say this happened to me and I'm glad she left to be with her lover. I don't like used goods.<br /><br />I say watch the movie. It's OK.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|It is well-conceived, well written, and well acted. Its sets and costumes are authentic. The photography is much better than in some older period pieces. Fellowes has picked a fascinating time in which to set his story, and has researched it well.<br /><br />Most important, the characters are interesting and largely sympathetic. The viewer cares about them, and wants to keep watching to see what happens to them.<br /><br />This is not the history of action and adventure (which can be well done, too). It is the history of people from all walks of life in a time of great change.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Very fun movie... Karl Urban was great.. Way way way better than the Stallone version, although that will always have a place in my heart....
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautifully done; authentic costumes, scenery, just wonderful!  I wish American television could do as good a job.<br /><br />I was a new viewer this season, 3, and went back and watched all of season 1 and 2.  Cannot believe I waited this long to watch this wonderful series.  Well Done!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We laughed, we cried, we clapped.  You can't go wrong mixing a good story with Father Christmas, Sandman, Jack Frost, the Tooth Fairy . . . a really good movie for all ages.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I heard some of these tunes on Pandora so decided to get this CD, it is great.  If you see an old 57 year old guy screaming lyrics in his car on the drive between Lewistown and Billings that is probably me and this is probably playing.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|This is a nightmare!  with a couple of exceptions - the acting is poor - the sets uninteresting - and it was poorly cast.  if you are going to produce a musical - a very long musical based on a classic book - then get somebody that can sing!<br /><br />I love music on stage and musicals, but this was not what I hoped for at all.  Could have been so much more.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|OUR BOOK CLUB READ THIS BOOK AND WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION AS A RESULT OF READING IT. I PERSONALLY DID NOT LIKE THE ENDING BUT COULDN'T COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE!
B000YMM3CC|4.0|The time line of this story adds interest to me. I can see my parents living during this time and being part of the ending.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|There is narrative, but no plot... I don't think the movie deserves much more commentary than that. If you want to watch a long-winded narrative about some irredeemable characters, watch this movie. If you care for a story, go elsewhere.
B005LAII3U|3.0|The movie would have been better if I had not seen the earlier version with Arnold.  Special effects were good.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic story, great characters, wonderful scenery and a extremely good history lesson of the early 1900's.  Highly recommend Downton Abbey, but should watch season 1 firstl.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The only thing I did not like was that one of the main characters that I really like dies.  Bummer
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Since I dont do Facebook, I really dont care about the connection,but the continous push to buy new lives is a bit over the limit.  I play 3 minutes, then BUY MORE HEARTS. Not for an old lady, even if its free, it cost too much.,
B00821OX98|5.0|Great Show! It streams in HD so if I didn't have data limits on my internet I would already be done with the season and on to the second.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|All the shows have another suprise,  and love Dr Who in all his reincarnations.  Been watching since I discovered it on IPBS about 30 years ago.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm ready for the next episode before the current one is finished! And when this season is over,  I'll watch it again waiting for the next season!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I downloaded it for a 3 year old Grandchild who loves it!  Although most of it is beyond his ability but a bonus the other 4 older ones love it too.  I like the new graphics.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Worth watching.  Good cast of actors/actresses.  A bit slow moving at times but overall a good pick.  A feel good movie.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I think better notes and about the game and the needs of the dragons and planting would be great.  My grandchild plays it mostly
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Suspenseful with twists that kept us on our toes.  Not able to guess what was going to happen next.  Kept us captivated.  I would watch it again.
B008M34INW|4.0|Not your typical mel gibson movie. I like to watch movies that have a different story line.<br />A good movie to rent on a Friday night.
B004OZZ624|5.0|This movie kept us captivated to see the plot unfold and all the details that had to fall into place in order for his plan to work.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Well worth the rent! Great story, great movie! An outstanding family movie.  I rented this movie, but ended up BUYING it after I seen it.  The actor who plays the main character does an outstanding job!  This is a MUST SEE!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely loved this brilliant game!!I thought it was a little childish at first but it is not and now l can not put it down!!!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Similar to 24 but more realistic, I would recommend for people wanting to watch a good drama with military and government plots
B000FC13Y0|3.0|This book was a good read but I kept comparing it to the movie with Michelle Pfiefer. I was disappointed in the ending. Nothing at all as exciting as the movie. The ending was a big let down!
B008C20TDG|5.0|A trainer at my gym recommended this book. I am an avid reader so I thought what the heck...It starts with Food gave me the science data in a language that I could understand and it all made sense. The logic behind what the Hartwig's are saying is so true. Eat pure feel better. I am going to do this for 30 days and see how I feel. I would bet that I feel 100% better than before eating all the so called &#34;food&#34; that is available in the US.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Honestly, I can watch this show over and over and over.  Great cast, the episodes always leave me laughing and wanting more!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I really love this album. Ellie Goulding definitely has great talent. Her voice is very unique and soothing to listen to. If you listen to her live sets, especially the one with Ryan Seacrest on the radio, you can see her raw talent. Beautiful!
B0059R5Q08|5.0|My family loved this movie and have watched it a dozen times, I believe it is a classic and will be the copy to have of this movie
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Because I am increasingly deaf, I often don't hear my bedside alarm clock. I ordered this in the hope that it would be louder. The first time I tried it, I left my Kindle in the next room, and when the alarm went off, I absolutely had no difficulty hearing it in the bedroom! I won't use this every day, but it will be very handy for traveling and for any morning when I absolutely, positively have to get up at a certain time (especially if it is earlier than usual). I like that you can set multiple alarms and set different times for different days of the week and easily turn the alarm off (that is, cancel it for the next day) without clearing the settings. I especially like that the app runs in the background but pops up on top when the alarm sounds, offering buttons to Snooze or turn off the alarm.<br /><br />I like the choice of alarm sounds--I don't have any music stored on my Kindle, so I haven't experimented with that, but there's plenty of variety even without. The choice of clock faces (three) is not as generous as some other apps offer (but one app that offers a large choice of faces also got terrible reviews because it tended to crash in the middle of the night!), but it is certainly adequate, especially if you're satisfied with the usual digital display. The weather report is a thoughtful addition, though it clearly reflects weather somewhere other than my immediate neighborhood, and it is presumably dependent on a wireless connection.<br /><br />I found all the menus and settings for the clock easy to access and understand and use. My only complaint is that there is no explicit way to exit the settings menus--no button for Save or Done or the like. Exiting the app does not suffice; the next time you access it, you are still in the settings menu. The only way I've found to get out is to use the Back button, which causes some uncertainty about whether settings have been applied.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great movie, great music. They did a wonderful job filming this great musical.  They could have added more bonus features.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good actors, good writing, great set (an actual Victorian mansion) and although this season gets a little &#34;Soap Opera&#34; like I still enjoyed it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you can't find something on this site...it probably doesn't exist.  Love to look for new recipes and craft ideas.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved it! Has all the DeMille excitement and edge of your seat entertainment. Just when you are gritting your teeth in anticipation the humour of Corey hits you full on! I would recommend this book to anyone with a taste for excitement, humour, just plain old fun and let's not forget to mention good old-fashioned patriotism.
B000MR1V22|1.0|The use of extreme profanity was absolutely unnessecary.  I couldn't get to my sound quick enough to mute the sound during those scenes.  Agenda's were pushed through the script of this movie.  And a family was portrayed with very real problems, and very unreal effects of those problems on the family members.  The final scene was disappointing, and glorified more perversion through the character of a child.<br />I ended the movie thinking what a sad and empty life the writers and directors of this film must live.<br /><br />Again, it was absent of any real depth of inspiration.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|The book is well written and the depth of coverage of those in Lincoln's cabinet give this work a special connection to that historical time.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Soooooo bad. Enough said. They said I need to use 14 more words in order to submit this review. Ugh .
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I wouldn't miss a movie starring Judy Dench....Very nice movie,,,Also great stars like Maggie Smith....interesting location. and interesting life stories of these people.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very well done. Loads fast, plays smooth, challenging but not impossible, and most of all fun. Right on. Highly recommend
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show,  no one is untouchable in this show! You think that certain characters won't be written off but the writers aren't afraid to write-off anyone!

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Very good movie for all ages. Plot was a lil sketchy, but didn't matter much to me. Animation was also very good.
B001395L06|5.0|Amazing story with an outstanding cast!  Would highly recommend to anyone who likes documentary based crime dramas!  Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe, WOW!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It's a music app.  Simple.  What more can one say for an app.  It works, downloads are quick.  Thank You amazon.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|I just Keep playing it over and over and over and over and over<br />and over and over and over and over and over and over<br />and over and over and over and over....
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I loved this book.  It took a little while to get into it, and to get to know the characters, but eventually things fell into place.  I love the fact that most of the women are very strong and capable and seem to become more so when their men have gone.  I also love the mixture of &#34;realism&#34; (eg. the descriptions of the battles and intrigues) and the &#34;fantasy&#34; (dragons!).  The last few pages made me want to immediately download the next book.  Great stuff!
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Paul Rudd is the new Ben stiller and really makes this movie great... Can't wait to see more Paul Rudd on amazon video
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Whilst the book kept my interest throughout, being quite a page-turner, I felt a bit disappointed and unnerved by the ending.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Critics didn't really dig it (reviews) but Oscars did? Hmmm...I think it was a unique attempt and, for the most part, successfully pulled off. Overblown? It's funny, the critics who claim it is overdone are the ones who overdo everything. Hypocrites. Go back to rating movies no one goes to. I think it is worth the money.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I loved this app except that it has frozen up over and over.  It messes up my Kindle so it crashes.  Only fix then is hard re-boot.  I finally dumped it.  I say save youself the aggravation.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|A heck of a lot better than most other sy-fy/fantasy movies. Stop Hating on it. If it came out before LOTR it would have rocked our Middle-Earth world and everyone knows it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It seems Grisham is past his summit and this story shows it. The plot is thick, but the last third of the book is nothing but how the caracters finish a job that did not need telling. Worst, there is no real climax and big surprise at the end. They wont make a movie out of this one.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I really love the entire series.<br />Great stories, and fantastic cast.<br />I find that I keep watching this over and over again...
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|I love to see and hear someone turn negatives into positives. TI keep up the remarkable work. I love it! This is still the beginning of an incredible journey for some many.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We have liked this program from the beginning.  It make you think about the &#34;end of the world&#34; and what you would do or not do with your family.  Its not scarey, but entertaining, but I still wouldn't let my 7 y.o watch it.  The latest season deals more with other living people than the dead, but its still good.  In my opinion I think they need to bring more dead people into the show... but with that respect there only so much you can do with slow dead people.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I like so much this app because I can organize my blogs. The design is so good and I feel confortable using it. I did not knew this app because I was using google reader the I think I will use this app for long time.
B009KEN87O|5.0|like space invaders only better! a fantastic Time waster. simple to play, just one finger. now i have to write more.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This game has decent graphics and really fun gameplay which the screenshots have not justified.<br />HTC evo 3d it runs smooth and the classical music is to taste.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|A book that keeps your attention, constantly wanting to know more. Challenges the reader with its continuous twists and turns.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show rocks! This is the best show right up there with Sons of Anarchy! I was hooked from the first episode!
B00BF11STU|2.0|boring to say the least...  it was very boring.  boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring.  waste of time
B007712XAU|5.0|Tried to stay away from watching another series but finally gave in to the 'friend' pressure!  Glad I did!<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for getting it to me earlier than the expected time!  Was able to Watch Season 1 & 2 in a long weekend.<br /><br />Thanks
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As great as West Wing! My wife and I love this series, it truly draws you in.  We highly recommend it!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|With an equal respect for longtime Trekkies and those new to the franchise, this is a movie that hits all the right notes without hitting anyone over the head.  The characters make you feel for them so much that you find yourself pulling for everyone by the end.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The hardest book ever I don't like scenarios because they r hard to read and smoking my brother turn to talk hi :-) rd Buddhism by jgjejdjjxjvvjkgof
B0045XGRQE|2.0|Iron Man 2 did nothing to further the story of Iron Man and was self-indulgent (as RDJ tends to be in his acting) and self-serving.  Largely uninteresting and extremely ordinary.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It is so addicting. If you like the temple run games you will absolutely love this.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|It's easy to hate Amy Chua, but she's right.  We owe it to ourselves to try harder, to push harder.<br />Her writing is superb.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book is whats happening in real life<br /><br />bullys should be bullied so they can see how it feels .
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Very few movies capture the essence of a book or broadway production. Somehow the director & cast manage to bring a new level of depth to a timeless classic.<br />The setting and rawness of the acting bring clarity and beauty to Victor Hugo's story of love grace and redemption.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I do not like it but I also like it a.little and it is ok I mean my sister likes and we once got all of the people and then my sister deletedde it so we hare to start all over and I was so mad I just wanted to.yell at her but j didn't because j love hr but now she is right next.to.me dative her toe
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game. I saw that a second one is coming out. Can hardly wait. I will player the second one and if the price to buy the second is cheap I will buy it.
140053271X|4.0|Touch screen is very good and grat reading aunctions, higher than espectations, would have enjoyed however more extra functionalities on this model, such as listening to music.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A coworker suggested I take a look at this show and from the first episode I was hooked! Excellent storylines and interesting characters make it so intriguing that I would stay awake til 3 am getting caught up on all 3 seasons. Almost developed a British accent! I hated the season to end and can't wait for Season 4 to begin!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a real gem and so much better than the tiny battery icon.  The &quot;use versus battery life&quot; calculations give a clue beforehand whether I need to drag the charger along when I take my tablet with me.  Another terrific feature is the &quot;time to compelete charge&quot;.  This is one utility I don't want to be without.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I've watched the most recent version of this story done as movie and it is disjointed and difficult to follow. This book, though, is all pleasure to read!! Wonderful book. This is my 3rd time reading it and it certainlynwon'tbe the last.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The story was great, the science interesting for a non-scientist, fun details and creativity.  I've already recommended it to many friends, i don't know enough to know if the science is correct but it was explained with out being boring.  Robinson Crusoe on Mars.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|My only real problem with this film is that the characters are rather flat, especially Mama. It would have been nice to get more back story on her. But the rest is good fun. I hope there's a sequel.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Very little plot. Extremely disappointing after the previous Christian Bale Batman movie<br />Very little plot. Extremely disappointing after the previous Christian Bale Batman movie
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|What a waste of my time.  The way it was filmed & directed stunk.  The only good thing was the costume design.
0765334798|3.0|This book grabbed me right from the start, building suspense, slowly revealing details. It is funny, entertaining and a great idea. I love the parallels to Star Trek, which some other reviewers have hated. But unfortunately you get to a point where you think this amazing story is over...then you find that there are three more parts to try and tie together everything. Unfortunately they fall flat on their face. I rushed through them to get them over with, but could have just skipped them. As a reader, I care about the characters in the first part, but to be honest don't care about the ones from the other universe. Scalzi seems to want to tie up loose ends, but he didn't have to-it seems a way to extend the book to the amount of pages he was supposed to deliver! Still an entertaining page-turner...until you get to the end of the main story.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Not at all what I expected, but I really liked it. Pretty deep yet funny.  The only thing that was missing was a good sound track.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|Besides being an engaging book from the first page, this is one of the most beautifully written books I've read. Plath uses words as skillfully as a painter uses colour. Recommended for anyone who loves words.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great firsr chapter! Thank goodness for hints cause I would have been lost!  I can't wait for the next chapter.
B0081336FO|5.0|It took me a while to finally check this series out and now I'm hooked. It's smart and quirky, intelligent and funny, and the chemistry between Sherlock and Watson is off the charts. My favorite episodes of the whole series are: A Scandal in Belgravia and The Reichenbach Fall. Oh, and I can't forget the superb villain, James Moriarty, played with joyful exuberance by Andrew Scott. This was just a perfect storm of talent, writing, production and a whole lot of fun!
B00846F1YW|3.0|the only thing I did not like was a puzzle where you have to put a picture together.  I have tried several times with no luck.  the part that makes it difficult is there is no way to by pass this puzzle.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this--great visuals, great story, great acting. Really an excellent film. well worth watching, probably even better on the big screen but I didn't get the chance to see it when it was in theaters.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|find the amber, researching the amber to make a dino and then building a pen for it is great.  but going through the tutorial is very boring and slow.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie is great for Family movie nights. I have a 3 year old little girl who was just as invested as her 33 year old father. The concept of the movie is interesting and original and it give a positive vibe to the room. I rented The Rise of the Guardians but I think I'll end up buying it because it'll be something we can watch over and over.
B0086700CM|1.0|to make your player move through the maze, you have to move your kindle around:  up, down, tilt sideways, and upside down( not really but it seems like it)  okay if your very hand to eye coordinated unlike me.
B008XNPO20|4.0|The 2nd album has been the bane of many a band, but in Tame Impala's case it is business as usual. Tame Impala's first album caught me by complete surprise - a retro, psychedelic, slab of indie rock gold. So expectation was high for the follow up & TI didn't disappoint. The album feels like the first with just enough progression to give the listener more than 'Innerspeaker' part 2. And the lead singer must be channelling John Lennon; his vocals are uncannily like the late Beatle. Highly recommended (on vinyl)!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Why do I need to write a comment? It's a good show. It deserves 5 stars. No description necessary ugh
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love checking the weather where my son is stationed and seeing the difference in temperature. He also loves to rub it in when they have beautiful weather there.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie. I put this one up there with Finding Nemo and Lion King and a few others. It's hilarious because Adam Sandler probably had a lot to do with it. Love that man!
B006HL9G10|5.0|I really enjoyed the free version  of this app, so I stepped up to the paid version, and it is even better. Well designed, good sounds, and never a problem.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this series. There were so many twists and turns. I gave this book a 4/5 simply because i did not like the ending. I would still strongly recommend it though.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|There are several tracks on this album which echo the best from the tenth Moody Blues album (The Present) as well as the Justin Hayward solo album &#34;The View from the Hill.&#34;  Especially appealing are: The Western Sky, In the Beginning, On the Road to Love and In your Blue Eyes. The remixes of It's Cold Outside of Your Heart and Broken Dream are very good, but the two Out There Somewhere mixes seem a bit out of place with the rest of this album (they are somewhat techno-pop). In all, a solid performance that should fit in the collection of anyone who enjoys Justin Hayward's music from the later Moody Blues days to present. l
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I can't believe that James can do it again and better than ever.  She gave us a look at our favorite characters WITHOUT tampering with their personalities.  It seemed that she had the mind of  Austin.  A PERFECT sequel with a murder to liven things up.  WELL DONE.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I tried to download this 4 times, and I still haven't gotten it.  Oh well I give up.  I guess mobotap spent want me to have it.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|quick read.  good story  I liked that it was not a very long book.<br />For sure it had uplifting parts
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I got it right when expected, the color is right, it works like it's supposed to, and my kindle is secure in it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!
B000FA5STS|3.0|This book does not get it done for me.  It does not catch my interest right off the start.  It almost seems like a \\"Chick Book\\" for some reason. I think women might enjoy this plot more than most men.
B005LJITS0|3.0|It was OK. Nothing to rave about. Just another run of the mill comic book movie. Maybe the sequel will be better.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Fun retro arcade style space invaders with a twist. Music can get annoying and it can be a little repetitive, but fun. Good for wasting time while waiting. Simple controls work well on my nexus 7 tablet.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a fast read.  I like how he brought everything to an understandable conclusion.  The characters were very interesting.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked this book and did not mind the ambiguous ending. Reminded me of the infamous fade to black last scene of The Sopranos series.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|it's more challenging than relaxing but lots of fun. Great game for free.Glad I gave it a try. Works great on both my galaxy and my Kindle fire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever!!! I love it espaichially since it is so easy to get gems!! it is a must get my dad loves it to
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|A great sequel to a great first game. More characters, types of play, weapons and special attacks. Good times, good times.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This was a fun game until I got to level 18. Now the game won't even open.  Would love for this to be fixed.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Super movie for the entire family. We enjoyed it so much that we went ahead and purchased it.  Teaches us that a bad guy can change his life around for the better...  Who doesn't love a happy ending?
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars is finally starting to come into his own! This one is worth owning.  This album is Diverse but Delicious!
1455519006|5.0|If you like Michael Connelly, you will also like David Baldacci. FBI and Secret Service instead of a local cop but has a lot of drama, suspense, excellent characters.
B001NHNG64|5.0|My 2nd Jack Reacher book and I can't wait for the 3rd. Lee Child has truly created a lasting hero for us to root for.  Well written and hard to put down. Wish I had found this series years ago but looking forward to all the rest. Enjoy!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|LOVE, LOVE THIS SERIES<br /><br />Lots of variety in the personalities of the characters.  The house and costumes add so much interest.
0393343405|3.0|The focus of \\"The Swerve: How the World Became Modern\\" is compelling. Before starting the book, the summary gives the reader the impression that he or she is about to read a thesis into how society's early thinkers set the foundation for the modern world. The author, Stephen Greenblatt, focuses particularly on a chance discovery of the ancient book \\"De rerum natura\\" (On the Nature of Things) by Lucretius, a Roman philosopher. An intriguing concept, but I felt the subtitle and summary were not an accurate representation of the book. The main focus of this book is actually on Poggio Bracciolini, the 15th-century scholar and book hunter who rediscovered Lucretius's book. So instead of reading a book on \\"How the World Became Modern,\\" we get a book that would be more aptly named \\"Poggio: A Life.\\"<br /><br />The actual analysis into how \\"De rerum natura\\" created a paradigm shift for posterity is only the focus of the final two chapters, and even then, the evidence that this literature was as important as Mr. Greenblatt claims is thin. He even writes the following disclaimer in the first chapter: \\"One poem by itself was certainly not responsible for an entire intellectual, moral, and social transformation--no single work was, let alone one that for centuries could not without danger be spoken about freely in public. But this particular ancient book, suddenly returning to view, made a difference.\\" This vague statement that the text \\"made a difference\\" can be said for any scholarly work since antiquity, and immediately arose doubt as to whether \\"De rerum natura\\" was really as revolutionary as the author makes it out to be.<br /><br />For a book that won both the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and the National Book Award for Nonfiction, I would've expected something more. However, the book is substantive, thought-provoking, and quite readable considering the subject matter. If you don't mind learning a bit more about Poggio than you probably cared to know, then you mayfind this book interesting and will definitely get something out of it.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This movie has its lull moments, but overall, just seeing Hopkins as the mumbling, emotional, wiskey drinking Hitchock is worth it! Great staff...if your a fan of murder and mahem...check this one out!
1476734941|5.0|10 days in and about 10 pounds down. I'm sure the weight loss will slow down soon, but this is a great way to kick start and keep me on board with this diet. The best part is, I've been eating whatever I want on my regular days. Maybe slightly less than usual, since I want to be good, but nothing drastic.<br /><br />I think there is value in reading the book itself. Yes, it's obviously a very straightforward diet and can be done without the book. It's not hard to count your own calories or find recipes for low calorie meals online (Real Simple has 30 days of dinners under 400 calories on their website. The one I've tried so far was fantastic - eggplant lasagna). But, the book explains the potential health benefits beyond weight loss, and, for me at least, that was inspiring to read and helped me get excited about trying this for myself.<br /><br />I personally don't find the fast days very hard, and neither does my boyfriend (who has also lost about 10 pounds so far even though he has way less to lose than I do). After dinner is probably the toughest part, so I've broken my days into about 200 calories for lunch and 400 for dinner. That way I'm less hungry late at night.<br /><br />I expected to be irritable and tired on my fast days, since being hungry generally makes (or made) me cranky. I haven't really noticed being particularly irritable, and if anything, I generally have more energy on my fast days, and have been sleeping well on fast nights. I actually wake up much more easily on the mornings after fast days as well, which has been a nice bonus.<br /><br />I bought this book for iPad but kind of wish I had a hard copy, since I'd like to be able to share with friends who are interested by the concept as well.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about starting this diet, just give it a shot. The first fast day was the hardest, but not terrible by any stretch. Each one since has gotten better. And when you're feeling hungry, just remember, you can have your cake.Just wait until tomorrow.
B001HOF8AA|4.0|I am enjoying this cd.  This is my introduction to Imelda May, and I like her music and her band.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This is a book ill be reading once a month just to keep my mind fresh of all the helpful insight. I love this book. Real review from a real reader.
B00772M1F6|4.0|This guy is definitely talented, and will be making his mark.  After apreciating this cd, I really want to see him live.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|If you like baseball this is a must see,because its an instant classic and it has first the comedy and drama of baseball and the love story that's why I give it 5 stars.
6305428425|5.0|This is one of my best friend's favorite movies. She says that it is a constant reminder that no matter how crazy an individual decides to live, being who are you and not being ashamed of it is gold!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is very easy to use, informative, and accurate. i love the radar feature too. i would highly recommend it!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Author interested in the 'turn of phrase' more than  than the story line.  The story line was very weak.  The characters were such that you really didn't care what happened to them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series has excellent writers and actors. It has been a thrill for three seasons and it just keeps getting better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson's new favorite app is Subway Surfers.  They are having so much fun and it is nice good food witht the added advantage of developing eye hand coordiantion.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the 2nd book in the series.  It was not quite as good as the 1st book, but still good.  I am looking forward to reading<br />the 3rd and final book.
0307949508|3.0|I thought &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#34; was a better piece of work - it held my interest throughout, while this volume could have been assisted by a bit more editing.  The secondary storyline about Erika Berger moving to a different job has nothing to do with the chief adventure, and feels like just page-filler.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have enjoyed all 3 books in the series.  Very good and hard to put down.  I think you have to read all 3 books to know what is going on.  A really good read.  I hated when the last book ended!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|My family thoroughly enjoyed watching the second season and we all can't wait for season 4 to come out on DVD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone.  It certainly had lots of action and was a fast paced read.  I am looking<br />forward to the next two books in the series.<br /><br />This is the first Suzanne Collins's book I have read.  I would read more of her books.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A hilarious and touching tale, have not laughed this much through a book in a long time. Loved it! Highly recommend.
0345803493|4.0|It continues to move the story line along. The book appears to have had some moisture damage along its top edge for about a third of the pages. However, this did not interefere with my ability to read it.
B00AKFG15S|1.0|This has got to be the worst ending to a book that I have ever read, spoils the whole read.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Very suspenseful film with excellent acting. I am a big fan of Anthony Hopkins and Ralph Fiennes. The rest of the cast was very good too.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I really like the way it was laid it and the progression for each exercise made since.  Good job with the book.
0345803485|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I ordered this book. I just wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I don't mind a book being x-rated or risque, but I was unprepared for all the s and m, bondage stuff. Despite that, the story compelled me to read on even though I thought the premise to be ridiculous and totally unrealistic.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|Love the way Rachel Mcadams character was a normal goof ball like the rest of us. But her determination and enthusiasem was the best.
B0096A9QXC|3.0|Not used that much , got for my grandson as I use my Kindle for reading books mostly not playing games
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game to play while traveling with a child keeps them occupied for long drives and is also fun for adults too
B008I43DYU|5.0|Easy to use. Enjoy the large number squares easy to read and use for an elderly person. Great purchase! Highly recommend.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|my 5 year olds favorite game for the nabi tablet he plays this game every day and cant wait for updates
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is easy to use and has all the features of the site -- my only grievance is that it doesn't always update your information (new followers,  posts, etc.,)
B008MEM24S|5.0|for a 5 year old used  on the nabi tablet. works great very fun game to play would recommend this
B008M87GJK|5.0|I don't have any complaints about this app. it updates with new articles daily and is easy enough that anyone could use it.
B00A757EFW|5.0|bought this for my 5 year old to play on his nabi tablet and he loves it would recommend game
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Many people complain that Anne's diary doesn't shed new light on the holocaust and/or the 2nd world war, but I disagree. Anne's diary allows us a glimpse into the past -- a glimpse into the lives of those under wrongful persecution and yet continue on even under the worst circumstances  -- a glimpse into the short life of an amazing young girl.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I needed additional pairs to go with the 2 pair that came with my Sharp 70&#34; Aquos 3D.  These are made specifically for Sharp TV's and they work perfectly.  They say they run 30+ hours on USB charge, so far I am approaching 20 hours of use and haven't had to recharge them yet.  Also, they fit comfortably over most all glasses except giant dorky ones and after a few minutes, you don't realize that you have them on.  The 3D effects are great with them.<br />Recommended.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Well done! Excellent detective show and very good acting.  Looking foward to watching the rest of the seasons. Thank you
1616550414|5.0|If you are a Zelda fan, this book is a must have...if you don't know The Legend of Zelda or you don't like it, well, you're missing one of the greatest game ever, and this book proves it. It contains tons of information, sketches and more.<br /><br />Thanks to Dark Horse to bring it to this side, it worths every dollar (and it's not expensive). Eventually, this will become one of the best books ever made.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the game, its a lot of fun and hey its free!! No ads popping up or hit and miss game play because it is free. Its a good time filler so definitely on my top 10 list!!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Yes, thanks to the wonderful assortment of songs on this CD, I am 15 again and carefree....even if I am stuck in traffic, down in the dumps, or just enjoying myself....a must have for baby boomers!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Works good and free. We saved money and still got nice game for the phone. Mahjong is a good game and a good puzzle game for those that like that genre
B002CMQS1O|5.0|no you dont. watch this gut busting parody of  the fantasy which calls itself rock and roll and youll see why. a must see for anybody who mistakenly believes such a thing really exists !
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am a BFG fan, I have there games on my PC and now on my kindle and Nook. The games runs flawlessly and has a lot of game play. Would recommend it to anyone
B008Y73940|5.0|Really good movie, interesting, keeps you interested to the very end!  I am glad that I did not miss this one.
B00AKCJB44|5.0|Great movie. Great songs. Why wouldn't you love the soundtrack? There is such a variety to the music you can't get bored of it.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Shows that just sex without feelings can satisfy only a small part of our being.  Much more meaningful when strings are attached!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Addicting!  Would recommend even to adults looking for a mystery series which is totally addictive.  A great series to buy on disc to watch in marathon runs.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Have been playing this for a week &amp; like it. Easier then other Mahjong games I have played. So far so good.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't have asked for a better love story!!!! I didn't want to put it down! Buy it, you will not be disappointed!!!!
1452110581|5.0|I got this for my wife.  She liked it as do I.  It also sometimes gives cause for reflection about us, which I think is a positive.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|The actors sang on set, no overdubs of pre-recorded tracks. Did anyone tell Russell Crowe this before they started shooting? At least give him an out? Once I heard the redhead cockney kids accent (Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche), it turned into a comedy, but not in a witty comedic way, but more like this thing just jumped the shark sorta way. Too long, poorly executed, the only way this thing made the Oscars was because it was designed to and it was too expensive to not campaign it hard. And watching Amanda Seyfried, with her big bulgy eyes, it's like watching E.T. being cast as Cossette. If you're in the mood for the story of Les Miserables depicted in fine cinematic grandeur, pass on this one. However, if you're in the mood for a really long unintentional comedy, may I suggest 2012's Les Miserables.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|One of the best movies I ever watched. Keven Costner is as good as he always is. A must see !
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This a well crafted work of modern science fiction. Has a Blade Runner-esque dark analysis of the human condition that stays true throughout the whole movie. You're really not going to get a better popcorn flick on a Friday night.
B0012DT9VK|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how wonderful Johnny does.  He shines as willie and brings such  a childlike quality to him that if you read the novel and felt him off cuff you are in for a great surprise.  My 6 year old loved it and watched it two times in a row!  This movie dare I say is better than the similar Willie Wonka and the Chocolate factory and is a must see!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Here's the problem with adapting from graphic novels... this is it, this movie is thee problem. If you're over thirteen, skip this movie.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|We have recently acquired a new dog who isn't entirely clear on the \\"wake up the humans to go out to potty \\" protocol. And since turning on the lights seems to wake up the whole house, navigating what might be a stinky minefield upon first arising is no fun. This app lights the way so I can avoid having to wash my slippers again and again.<br />It's also pretty handy because I'm kind of afraid of the dark, but let's not dwell on my shortcomings. Let's just thank the Kindle Fire gods for this app. (I didn't give it an entire 5 stars only because I don't like absolutes.)
B00BF11STU|3.0|Historical accuracy is all over the place on this one. But Bigelow manages to keep you on the edge of your seat despite lots of boring CIA analysis work.
1603427244|5.0|This book is wonderful! I will most likely use this book for many of my knitting projects and experiment with using the methods perhaps even in crochet edgings or where some stretch or more firmness is needed.<br />I would recommend this book to both experienced knitters who need more ways to start and complete projects and to the beginner who needs to learn new ways to do things that work. I believe it is a must have reference book for knitters and those who like to mix crochet and knitting together, etc.<br />Thank you for this book!
B00B935SUY|5.0|Like many of Dave Grohl's endeavors, this first doc is amazing. I learned so much about how an album really is made and how some of the greatest albums of all time were cut. More legendary artists than you could stuff into an elevator and honest candid interviews. This documentary lacks nothing.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|the quality of the picture was ok. i meant only to rent, not buy the movie. if i were to buy it, i'd much rather have the bluray for the full visual experience. ; (
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Whoever says that doesn't usually watch Bond films. But this is a darn good one. Watch it just for Javier Bardem's goofy dye job. It's a great movie.
B009CG9M8Y|5.0|This was a very enjoyable movie, with great acting and good humor. I would definitely recommend it as a good date night movie.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|When they put up haunted houses around Halloween, you can only go to the same one so many time before you're laughing at the guy jumping out of the corner with a chainsaw with no blade on it. That's this movie, the fourth time going into the same fun house. I know these things are cheap to make, but develop a new story line already. You can only warm over a weak concept so many times and apparently for this franchise, they should have stopped at 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have hardly heard from my son all weekend.  He is having a blast and can tell me how many more coins he needs to get the next prize.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|When I first heard the plot of this movie I thought how can you sustain a guy in a boat with a lion. Ang Lee pulls it off. The cinematography and blending of cgi is nothing like I've ever seen. Inspirational as well. You wouldn't waste your time watching this movie Richard Parker.
B00136Q5IQ|5.0|this is a good CD. I have been listening to this CD for 8 years now although I'll admit I only listen to half the songs.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The evolution of Walter White is amazing to watch in the professional hands of Bryan Cranston. Don't think too many actors working today could pull off this character. If you've seen the previous seasons, this show is definitely not losing steam.
B001V5CIFI|1.0|Terrible movie.  What a letdown.  Narration was too intrusive.  Father is an undertaker (great occupation for a children's movie).  Nanny McPhee was scary not like Mary Poppins at all.  My 4 and 2 year old walked away.  Worse of all, story was BORING.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season of the Walking Dead just accelerates the popularity of this show. One of the best written character dynamic shows in recent pay cable history. Appointment viewing.
B001NHNG64|5.0|It was an amazing and thrilling mystery, full of suspense action and chalk full of excitement. I loved this book.
B008IYSMLY|4.0|Always love Dexter, this show is a fun ride, but this show is running out of wiggle room to credibly have Dexter get away with it for a few more seasons.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I like kik the app for letting us talk to our friends. Thank you very much for the free apps.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game reminded me of a solo version of the Nintendo classic Super Mario Cart. Drive around an island and pick up coins. Great graphics and it plays extremely well even on my POS 7&#34; PanDigital Black. I just started playing so I can't comment on depth or replay value, but it sure looks like a winner to me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I've got to admit this book is one of the best. I related greatly to it and wanted to keep reading every time I turned a page. Props to Auggie!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is really realistic and I like it because I can see how it is to take care of a real horse
B009KEN87O|5.0|I think that this is a great game and worth buying. Without a doubt, this is the best retro game I have ever played. Thank you, Noctua Software. You are the best.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I recommend Percy Jackson for kids around 9 or higher. It is a enjoyable book about Percy Jackson and his quest to find Zues's master bolt. I enjoyed reading it and I hope you do to! ( If you are looking for a long book this book is right for you because it has over 200 pages!)

B004MC8CA2|1.0|Ended up reading through the Old Testament for the first time and stoned my own children. What could I do? This book said to stone them if they were being disobedient. Very upset :(
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Really good game and fun!<br />Reminds me of the Mario brothers game.<br />I loved that game and could play for hours!!!!!!!<br />Definitely would keep this on my kendle
0393339882|5.0|The best thing I liked about this book is that it covers the main historical points adequately, without spending a lot of time diverging into historical events that had less of an impact to QM.  Most of the material in the book centers around Einstein and Bohr, and some of their colleagues which were also major players.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|my needs were simple and so was this app.  It does the math so I am satisfied, and it was free.
B0091REZMW|5.0|No, you won't be able to sit and play indefinitely without paying $, but you don't need to spend a dime if you just wait to let your energy return.<br /><br />Good graphics. The friend system has been revised so it's all in-game requests. Fair game for a forced Tapjoy download to get gems in another game. I'm actually keeping it around, which is more than I say for most.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|This would not work with my Kindle Fire.  I wish I knew which apps were compatible with the Kindle Fire before I attempted to get them to work on mine.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminiscent of Space Invaders from the 80s. A perfect little diversion. Basic retro fun, and a nice change from other apps which are frustratingly complex and/or difficult. No hidden agenda or money-seeking ads. It's just a good game. Highly reccomended.
B000007UXS|5.0|The best alt-rock oriented Radiohead record available. It's fun to sit and listen to a band evolve and this is a great sophomore lp. Highly recommend.
B008CRC506|5.0|Great songs, great storyline.  A wonderful series.  I completely enjoyed going behind the scenes of a broadway production.  What fun to see how a production comes to life!
B000007VFU|4.0|I'm not going to review but I recommend. I agree with my girlfriend who said, &#34;It kinda has a mid-nineties gin blossoms vibe.&#34; It's just better.
B007MCTTHY|1.0|Not impressed glad I ddn't pay for I. Uninstalled it after a day.<br />Too many similar games that ate much better.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Previously I had just the seasons puzzle game and had lost puzzle works when it closed.  I am very happy to say that even after 2 force close it will ask you if you want to continue with the puzzle or start it new.No lost puzzle work.  I enjoy the 216 piece puzzles they seem just right. The pieces are easy to see a d work with.  There still remains the slight time lag but as long as this app saves my work-i will gladly put up with the lag.<br />ADDENDUM<br />I installed this in my new Fire HD and only now realized that there is a monthly set of puzzles, where you get one daily, the puzzle remains hidden until you complete it.  That's half the fun of working on the puzzle and trying to guess what it is.  I enjoy the 280 piece puzzles...though for the life of me couldn't figure out why after an update the pieces seemed so small, hitting forehead.  You look at something time and time again and just expect it to be 216 as they were when it started.  No wonder the pieces seem smaller...they ARE..lalala.  I dislike the white edges but I can work with them.  I do wish on the preview screen when you are picking out which puzzle to do that it was a complete picture instead of pieces of the puzzle missing.  If you are going to show me a preview please show it all to me or not at all.  I enjoy these puzzles tremendously.<br />Only thing I would change is once the piece is in and fits that the puzzle lines would disappear.  I do puzzles on my pc and that is how they work and it makes for a nicer graphic...just looks better.  Thanks for making this great puzzle app and thank you for the free puzzles!!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I bought this album simply because it was Enya. Imagine my surprise when I found out it was a Christmas album. I didn't recognize any titles as Christmas titles but once I heard the album I knew. I love it. One of the most beautiful recordings of 'Silent Night'. It's sung in gaelic I think and I love it so much I play it all year long.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|At first I thought all the singing would bother me but I really enjoyed it.  Everyone did an excellent job of telling the story thru song even Russell Crowe (surprise).
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I am a big Enya fan. I play her music when I want to relax and this album does that for me. I am an old fuddy-duddy and I don't care for Brittany Spears, Beyounce, etc. I like music that has sooths the soul and this does that. I love most new age music and Enya leads the list of favorites for me. Beside, she's naturally pretty and has a great voice.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This series is amazing, and I can't wait for season 3!!!!!! If you want to see a Sherlock for our times this is the one to watch!!
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|This passes the time, but the unimaginative use of cruelty in place of drama and the gratuitous and misogynistic &#34;sex&#34; really make this hard to take.  I'd say it's a toss up whether or not this is entertaining.  Definitely not worth a cable subscription, so episodic viewing on amazon is a plus.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|You know this album is really about testing the Metallica \\"brand\\"- to see who the fans are and willing accept this piece of junk.<br /><br />Some call it \\"art\\" but let's face it, apart from some good riffs the whole concept with Lou's Alzheimer's like ramblings are really just incoherent noise that may have been acceptable (or even cool) to a hippie on LSD 50+ years ago but not now.  YOU NEED DOPE to understand this record.<br /><br />Metallica has lost it long ago and I couldn't even begin to wonder what they were thinking when they decided to do this.  Lou, if you read this you and your records belong in the trash can of history despite what the 60's throwbacks at Rolling Stone mag say- joke's on you guys.  Thanks for putting (yet) another nail in the coffin of a once good band.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Exactly as I expected. The item arrived as expected. I would order this again from this vendor. Fast arrival time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Thank you for this app. I have found it extends my tablet battery life and also monitors the battery.I would highly recomend using it.
B005R32L66|5.0|Exactly as I expected. The item arrived as expected. I would order this again from this vendor. Fast arrival time.
B008Y73940|4.0|A well written and played movie with an entertaining central theme.<br />Action packed and full of suspense.<br />The actor is engaging and holds interest through out the movie.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|This was a brave and I feel, successful, attempt to shed light on the varying conceptions of TRUTH, TRUST and FAITH in Government and/or lack thereof.<br /><br />It fairly depicts some gut wrenching facts about Trust.  In fact, this film challenges the audience to ponder the question of Who Can You Trust? I'm not into conspiracy theories..but I am into critical thinking, being as informed as possible and thinking for myself.  Here's some challenges: how do we know we can trust our media to give us the truth?  How does the media pick out what they want to highlight for us and what they want to hide?  And there are so many variations on the truth.  We've been taught to trust the news, but when most major news sources are owned by a few, select interests, or even one, large corporation, isn't it likely that we are seeing what someone else wants us to see?  Are we believing what someone else wants us to believe?  Seriously. How do we ever know what the REAL agenda is?<br /><br />This film made me think about these things...not that I haven't pondered such ideas before.<br /><br />OK, not to give anything away and spoil it, I'll just give a short summary:  We see the lead character  (very well done by Mark Whalberg) going from faithful, active military duty-- believing what he was doing was for the betterment of people's lives and our democracy as a whole to being abandoned and resentful of the Government. We see him go into solitude and it's obvious he has deep, angry scars and wants peace. What follows is an plea to return to service. He is told he is the only one who can do the job and reminded of the oath he took when he became a soldier.  His buttons were pushed and he allowed himself to TRUST again and put blind FAITH ahead of his gut instinct and anger.<br /><br />What follows is a thrilling and breathtaking nightmare adventure which nearly kills him....but is that the end goal anyway? He's no fool and has enough field training and expertise to allude his enemieswhile devising strategic plans to do whatever it takes to win back his freedom. But does he?  Who wins in the end? Perhaps no one.<br /><br />If you like action/adventure and are open-minded about controversial Governmental/Political subject matter, you may appreciate the messages in the film.<br /><br />Those that don't keep up with politics or our Government may not...or may find parts boring..but it's still a wild ride with great actors...and they all do a superb job in my opinion.<br /><br />Awesome dialogue, story line, actors, atmosphere and scenery =a film worth watching.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />That's it.<br /><br />Peace.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game it makes you feel like your really the shark there are like 4 or 5 types of sharks a reef shark, mall shark, hammer head, tiger shark, and a great white.But I'm only at the hammer head!! :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King book before because they didn't interest me, but this one was terrific.  My husband read it first and recommended it to me.  I couldn't put it down. I would not recommend this for younger impressionable readers, but for mature audiences I would definitely recommend it to.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I like the look, but it proceeds to shut itself down every third jump. Helpful info but must be a band aid they can put on the kinks...that must be the free app!!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|when I was little I love hello Kitty and this game is fun but at school people say she is evil :( :)
B009MF5BXK|3.0|IT WAS BASICALLY A BUNCH OF PLASTIC SURGERIED OLD ACTORS JUST DOING A SPOOF, BUT I DIDNT NOT HATE IT
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|its very fun and addictive. gameloft got cheap on the kindle. watch the video. that's ipad gameplay its not as cool is the video shows
B005FISBTO|4.0|THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE HURRIED AND NOT SO INTREGING AND HARD TO FIGURE AS THE FIRST 5 SEASONS I GUESS BECAUSE IT IS COMING TO THE END OF DEXTER THEY MUST BE RUNNING OUT OF PLOTS
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Deception and backstabbing reign supreme.  Twists and turns that you never see coming.  Show moves at lightning speed.  Can't wait to see what the boys are up to in the next episode.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is wonderful!  Love all the info that it gives for the day!  It has been pretty accurate so far!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|When I read comments from Tony Visconti about this upcoming album, I was excited and cautious - I mean what else would he say but positive things? Excited because Bowie re-emerged from exile with new material, but cautious because his last few releases in my opinion were hard to take. Having saw the video for 'Where Are We Now', i was still doubtful, but the second video for \\"The Stars Are Out Tonight\\" gave me hope. I purchased the album on its' release date, and i have listened to it over and over since then. Yes, Bowie is back, at least the one that I enjoy. Each song sets its' own mood, and most are only around three minutes long. It sounds a bit like Heros in some places and Aladdin Sane in others with a mix of Hunky Dory and even some of his pop dance albums like Let's Dance. Every time I hear it I pick out new things to like. If you are a Bowie fan, this will not disappoint!
B008K6DU4Y|2.0|I just couldn't get this to work on my Fire.  I did a lot of reading and visiting the MX webste but just couldn't figure it out so I tried VPlayer instead and it works well.  I'm not saying MX isn't a good product, just that it didn't work for me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a great game. But its also a cheating game.<br />it help kids, I been stuck on some missions,  Im in Rome now,  I just left Rio.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed watching her show, it played perfect on my Kindle Fire Hd, Cher is very entertaining with her costume changes and jokes!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I love watching Star Trek Enterprise over and over,  I like the stories and the characters. It;s too bad there aren't more
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This book is full of surprises.  Some of them are the dirty little secret tricks that DA's, actually use in trials, and the strategies defenders use to defeat their underhandedness.  The actual meaning of the title has to do with something you will never expect; something I'm not going to tell you.  But it has to do with a certain defense lawyer's strategy.  You won't want to lay it down.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Very well written. The imagery that she creates makes you feel like you are there and watching as the story unfolds. I hope that the authorwrites more books. This book was Excellant. I will read this again and again.
B000FA675C|5.0|Fascinating story by a puzzle master. A great mix of good story and interesting history.  Anxiously awaiting his new book 'Inferno'
B009K0P10K|4.0|Exhilarating! Can't barely wait til season three starts.. revenge is not as easy and sweet as Amanda expected. She is paying a much more heavier price..
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This season has been great so far, I am liking the new agent, while I miss Emily I have to say the new girl has been keeping her own quite well. I am also loving the new season villain the replicator he is defiantly keeping the agents on their toes. I look forward to seeing how the season will end.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|What else can you say, a great series on Blu-ray...the picture quality and sound is amazing. I bought this on sale for about the price of one disc, which can't be beat.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Watch this movie for 10 mins. then The Elevator Scene... It is Amazing to watch those 2 girls dancing so silly. Then The Tapioca, and Razberry, soy sauce, and more. If u enjoy Mary Tyler Moore or Julie Andrews, this movie must be in your collection!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you have seen Firefly then you have most likely already checked out this movie. For those who haven't though I recommend checking out the show before going into this movie even though you don't have to. Serenity sets up the characters so you won't be lost going into it, but I would at least try to find and watch the two hour pilot to Firefly since that really sets up the characters and the story well so you will understand and appreciate the movie more. On it's own Serenity is a great film but put into context with Firefly it really gets better. It has a great story and some really great twists that you won't expect. Overall Serenity is a great ending to one of the best tv series of all time.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|No place to carry a power cord, so what's the use?  OTHER THAN THAT IT'S okay just for keeping the dust off and keeping it from getting bumped around..looks good if that masters to you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was one of those series I had not seen the first time around, but after hearing great things about it I decided to check it out. It was one of the best decisions I had ever made. Firefly has a little bit of everything in it-Sci-Fi, Drama, Comedy, and basically anything else you can think of. The characters are all very unique and they all have a huge part in the show which makes it easier to connect to each one and understand their story. It is hard to find anything else that hasn't already been said about Firefly so I will end this review by just saying buy this series. I have the DVD set and it has every episode in order with some great extras. Overall Firefly is an amazing series and this set does it justice.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Enjoy the series a great deal and very much-excellent!<br />Great cast and acting.<br />Streaming quality is just wonderful with no interruptions.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I downloaded this for my tablet, it works well with Android OS. I recommend it for a fun mind engaging experience. this game will keep you on track. A great way to help kids learn to focus on one thing at a time. I found that even my ADHD kids can stay focused for a longer period of time on this game. a little addictive at times.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Love using my fingers or a stylus, love the many thoughtful design features (Layers!). As a professional designer and illustrator this is a terrific tool, though I really need a bigger screen. to work on.
B004SRNH10|5.0|all Adobe products have been great for me. as usual its works great. I have been an Adobe user sense its launch, best way to download and transfer large files.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was so looking forward to enjoying this incredible story on film. With a stellar cast and a timeless story I expected something more. From the beginning of the film, the story and characters were lost in a self-important stylized presentation. Self-indulgence at its worst from the director. Impossible for me to become engaged. We returned the movie without finishing it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is an absolute must to get up-to-date weather, radar, maps and can even zoom all the way to an aerial shot of your house with Google Earth. lets you know just how close the storms are to your town. in tornado country its been a blessing.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|one of the best movies i have seen, ranking in the top 25 personally for me, great cast, great plot, one of a kind!
B0086700CM|5.0|seriously, this game is so challenging,  using touch screen control you fide your self almost jumping and sucking wile sitting in a chair. this game has been known to aggravate me to the point of my Girl friend has to take it way to settle me down. lol. worse the driving in traffic with road rage. but you will love it.
1932100660|5.0|This book will change your view of nutrition, even if you are already vegetarian. It will demonstrate, with 'bulletproof' nutritional science, that food can change the way your body relates to diseases, from formation to progression - even reversal of diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer. And my father is a living proof that a wholly plant foods diet can extend your life (and quality of life) when already diagnosed with an aggressive terminal blood cancer. Still going strong seven years later.<br />All doctors should have this book as part of their tertiary education syllabus.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|If your a sci-fi nut and love Angry Birds hen you will adore this version. they did a great job getting the Sci-Fi lovers on board.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I had read about the movie prior to its release at the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF), and I couldn't wait to see it.  Unfortunately, it was here only a week and I missed it.  Wasn't I pleasantly surprised to see it on my Amazon movies list.<br /><br />I won't go into details because this is a movie best seen without too many details, but...well, watch it for yourself and see.
B00BVYRLYC|4.0|Fantastic drama, the only problem I have with it is that it lacks the motivation as to why the Scandinavians and Saxons attacked England, and that is the Christians under Charlemagne attacked Fris
0525951652|3.0|I loved Ken Follets Eye of the Needle and Pillars of the Earth but this book felt flat to me and took forever to even remotely capture my &#34;what's going to happen next&#34; button or even my &#34;curious to know what is coming&#34; button. The writing was so trite in so many ways. Themes, connections between people, descriptions of traveling on the ship, or romances were all things that you could have pulled right out of someone else's novel. The characters were typical of many other novels, just different names. I could almost call it dreary. The topic was disturbing of course and I came away with it better understanding what my grandfather went through. I do have good comments on the way Ken developed the genuine history. I did get a history lesson through the intertwining stories about the people. Loved the map so I could flip to the front or back and see exactly where the Germans were approaching for example.<br />However, it just dragged on and on and on to the point where I thumbed through the last part of the book just to hit the highlights. I honestly don't know why this is such a rave review book nationwide. Yes, he should have received the honor he received for best depiction of WWI...and if you love war books then this might be a great book for some people. My nephew loved loved loved it and bought the next in the series immediately. The author just did not grab me and not let me go. That is what I wanted in a famous authors highly praised book. But the dialogue had me yawning instead. Disappointed.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book keeps your mind moving and jumping. Gillian Flynn has a very active imagination. I enjoyed the twists in the story.
B00001QEE8|5.0|plays well no issues and was the version i wanted. i am very pleased with the condition of bothte disc and its case.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|There will never be another group like Queen and Freddie Mercury sure is a legend, far beyond a star. A poignant look at the origins of the most unique band ever!
B00BF123WG|5.0|Really well done movie. We loved it. Movie reminds you of how  brave ppl make this country what it is
B004LWZW8I|5.0|and a greater gift! My friend was very surprised! Quintessential Tarsem and the best of the &#34;titan&#34; type Greek hero movies!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Since the kindle has a screen that is big it in the best device to play minecraft on!!!!<br />Definitely the best device to play minecraft on!!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|A well done movie. It contained my interest throughout the movie. The movie keeps you guessing until the end if this immature child will wise up or continue his infantile journey to  reject society, belongings, and money.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Keeps you on your toes.  Quik moving and fun.  This is for any age, even older adults.  fun for all
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I remember seeing the previews for this and never was intrigued enough to see it in theaters.  After seeing so many strong reviews though we thought we would check it out.  I never thought I would love it as much as the kids, if not more.<br /><br />Much like Wreck it Ralph this was a surprising hit.  We need more films like this with great animation, humor that all can appreciate, and story lines and characters with enough depth to keep you interested.  This one is also watched many times in our home.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Bought seasons one and two, then watched season 3 on TV.  It was well worth the time and money!  Loved it!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I can't believe I missed this movie in the theaters.  It's not only great for the kids but my husband and I watch it over and over.  Great story line and both kids and adults will appreciate the many elements this film has going for it.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I loved this movie...Jackie Chan was great in it and Jaden Smith was such a good little actor...Scenery in China was beautiful and the filming and acting was so well done...If you want a 2000 version of the Karate Kid, this is it!
B00999DFP0|5.0|I love this show. best ever<br />but I am disappointed in the sellers dvd's  newly opened and the second dvd had a huge scratch on it and we can't watch it :(
B00BHMF578|1.0|This video did not work. It did not stream as it should have and it must be a problem with the product because, after 3 tries, we finally decided to stream it through one of your competitors! I would expect a credit on my account.
B00A83075M|5.0|I bought this dvd for my grandkids for are movie night and we truly enjoy it. It's cute and funny. I would recommend this movie to any one that has grandkids or just for yourself.
B009JNQ86Y|3.0|her previous album had way more hits this one. this album holds the same tone all the way through except for one song.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I ordered all of the movies for my granddaughter.  This movie was a good price and arrived in perfect condition.  Packaging is a big deal to me.  Great deal.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How do I even begin to describe this book? I've been trying to figure it out for a couple of days now and I'm still kind of stumped - that's the impact this book will have on you. You will just sit there and ask yourself, what did I just read? You will do this because it's a little hard to describe. It's not your average teen story of girl meets boy, boy rebuffs girl, somehow boy and girl manage to get together. No, it's so much more than that. It may start out like that, but then it twists and turns in a direction that will leave you breathless and wondering, what the heck just happened? But it does it in such an organic way, you get swept along and really become a part of everything you're reading. You believe this story - believe it really could happen. And the explanation of what the title really refers to is another stunner - I was left in awe over it.<br /><br />I can't really describe what happens within the story without revealing spoilers and I don't want to do that, so all I will do is say this is a must read. And if I had to describe it in one word it would be: amazing.<br /><br />I look forward to reading other books by this author.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have just started watching the series and after finishing season 1 and 2 I most eager to start season 3. Highly enter raining, great characters - it is like an 1800s soap opera. Good and addictive.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I usually look for big fish games but the story hooked me in. I purchased the full game. I would definitley recommend.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I loved this series.  I am looking forward to seeing the next one.  I would totally recommend this to a friend.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I don't know why I like it but I do.  It's fun and challenging.  Sometimes it freezes on me; thus the four stars.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever watched. The characters are so riveting you forget who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. I am addicted to this show and can't wait for season 6
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I didn't know I was a fan but I absolutely LOVE this CD.  It's the best CD I've bought in quite awhile.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game its so real to me. given it 5 star because I think you shoud get it
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This Viking Drama HA Far Exceeded My Expectations And Is A Must see. Acting Is Wonderful And The Subordinated Is Far More Accurate To Historical Accounts Than Anything Else I Have Seen D'oeuvres Of The Nordic Culture.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not as good as previous James Bond Thrillers. The acting and special effects were excellent but the plot wasn't very interesting. For example, when Bond was shoot on the train fighting the bad guy. Why did M order him to be shot. That didn't make sense. M should have waited to see how he would have come out of the fight. And then after having shot him he falls hundreds of feet into a nice awaiting river only to survive and start a well deserved vacation on the beach. It just didn't hold together well. You expect Bond to do fantastic things but you don't expect M or him to make mistakes in judgement.
B007XELMO4|1.0|I am used to having products not meet my needs and this product was no exception. Once I had it I immediately took a razor to the product and cut out everything but the locking plate and the cam. I then added a backing plate and mounted it with machine screws and locknuts to an existing backpack. The strap provided to prevent the camera from rotating, slipping out of the plate and falling was also inadequate. So I made a short camera strap and attached it to a carabineer. That did the trick until I install a locking pin. After these modifications it made a good product, however at twice the price of competitors, it's not worth the money. I will be using something else in the future.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Great season.  Great chemistry between the Doctor and Donna.  As well as some exciting surprise appearances from the Doctor's past.  It got my heart racing.  It also begins to string some storylines that will continue when Matt Smith takes reign of the Doctor persona.  I thinks its so cool how a little story line that is told in this season is carried out 1-2 seasons later by another actor.  Very cool.<br /><br />If you haven't figured it out yet, this is also the last season with the great David Tennant as the Doctor.  Where as season 2, he's this happy go lucky guy, this season, although still funny and at ease, he is more and more serious and I will let the episodes plot tell you why.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first i was never going watch the movie but I said why not read the book. I cried, I laughed, and I was so happy. This book was truly amazing; to me life changing.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|There is not &#60;quite&#62; as much blood, gore, and sex when compared to the first season.  I've never read the books, but I am to understand that the show is following the books very closely which I admire.  I also am enjoying the storyline more and more as it progresses and we meet new characters as well as build more complexity with the characters we already know.<br /><br />Its worth to continue with this series, you won't be disappointed.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have only just started watching NCIS in December of 2012, and I fell in love. Gibbs, DiNozzo, Abby, McGee, Ducky, Ziva and even Kate (from seasons 1 & 2) have become like family.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Only rarely do you find a book that you become so involved in that it becomes real to you.  This book will make you sad, happy, laugh, and cry. The racing metaphors seemed too much at first but then I accepted the importance of each and every one of them. You must read this book if you have ever been lucky enough to have been owned by an Enzo. Thank you Mr. Stein!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|OMG.  Are you kidding me?  After all of that hype?  There is really no better way to say it - one of the worst movies ever made in the history of mankind.  Possibly tied with Joe and the Volcano for that title.  Run, run, run from it.  Not that it matters, but, in fairness to the actors, the acting is very good - they all do a great job, but when the movie/script/story is so horrible, what difference does that make?  You've been warned.  Good luck.  w
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Granted on my droid phone the game was free. It really is worth the $.99 for it. I played the game before on a website. It is so much fun to play and the game is never the same. Looking forward to all the updates planned. Only downside at moment is that I can't buy anything. It will not connect to amazon app store.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book.  I saw the movie and thought book one was good but this is so much better.  I could not put it down and I can hardly wait to read the next book.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I show this movie to my sixth graders and they love it.  It gives them a better understanding of Autism.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I'm the kind of girl that never cared to watch shows like this. But during one lonesome night, I decided to watch it and got hooked.  I have the first 5 seasons free on Netflix, so you can imagine the horrific painful thought of not being to watch the last one. Thankfully -although it's much shorter than the rest - I was able to find it here on Amazon.  It is the best season of all. So worthy of my time.  I don't have to feel lonely to watch it because I LOVE it!
030758836X|5.0|Reading this book reminds me of dog racing, the kind of racing where they have the artifical \\"rabbit\\" called \\"Rusty\\" racing around the track, always just ahead of the dogs.  They dogs can't stop in their pursuit of the \\"rabbit...\\"<br /><br />So it is with this book. A good story so well and effectively told that the reader finds himself or herself in much the same situation as the dogs chasing ole \\"Rusty.\\" They can't stop and neither can we, once we get into the story...so gripping and so well told...the end of each segment leaves you wanting, begging for more, to see what happens next...salivatng for what comes next...It's that good.<br /><br />Any married person will see part of himself or herself in this book, sometimes enough to bring as chuckle or a laugh...At other times the thought, \\"Oh, you feel that way, too\\" or \\"You have that situation, too...\\" \\"I know about that...\\"<br /><br />But in the end, let's hope that Nick and Amazing Amy aren't too much like us and that we aren't too much like them...but the similarities are there, for all married couples and all who have been married.  The author of this book might well have been a marriage counselor--or have had some heavy duty counseling along the way to know how married people think, feel, behave and react...<br /><br />To sum it up, a literary \\"Fatal Attraction,\\" well written and well told.<br /><br />So, who gets what in the end?  Do they deserve what they get?  Do they deserve each other?  Can they make it work?<br /><br />Questions you will be thinking about long after finishing this book.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The songs are so very meaningful.....Great guidance for life's relationships, unusual in a modern stageplay....I want to see the show someday
B003QS9WIE|5.0|The story is very well written and the acting is excellent. It is suspenseful and entertaining,  The Prestige is a breath of fresh air. It is like a  modern Alfred Hitchcock film.  I was pleasantly surprised by this sleeper of a hit.  Definitely will watch again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i already have AccuWeather on my mac and iPhone, so naturally i put it on my new Kindle fire HD. As with almost anything in this life, there's always room for improvement.  It has everything i like to see when i look at weather, for daily use or traveling. Best of all it's free.
0792164903|5.0|same as above movies were in one package again thanks for taking care so they were in great shape when recived
B009ZE27US|1.0|This is really stupid. it kept telling me im in the 20s all the time. im only 10!  i thought it will be close to my age but it wasnt. it said i was 26  then 25 then 23 . IM ONLY TEN!  maybe it will be close to your age but it was more than a ten year difference. That is my opionion!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought I was watching it for free on Amazon. At least that's what it showed. Sure, I liked it very much.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I will be reading this book again and again. I could not put it down.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this. weather app it tail it great haven't had any.  problems.  I like it a lot give it try you wont be unhappy.

B00594XOZU|1.0|I think that amazon needs to make this app for the 1st kindle fire. I downloaded this from 1mobilemarket.com and it worked. PLEASE PUT THIS ON THE APP STORE FOR THE 1st KINDLE FIRE!!!!!! I NEED IT
0920668372|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone  with children.  I gave it to both my sons when the children were born.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book has the ability to make you realize how lucky you are and how important it is to value your time.
1416972250|4.0|I love this series! Which I could say that the movie looked as good, but I still plan on going to see it. Only complaint is that the book cover was a little bent when I opened the box.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book completely surprised me in the end.  I thought I knew what was going on but was completely wrong.  Couldn't put it down.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This movie met my expectations.. action packed, had great plot and actors did a fantastic job at it. I would definitely recommend it.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Cuban summarizes many of his best thoughts on how he looks at his past experiences, what he learned from them and encourages us to do the same.., try, learn, keep moving.  The other theme that I appreciated was that you only have to be right once.  Might not be your first, second, or fifteenth idea that works, but when you find the one that does, that is the only one that mattered.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best he ever!!!! I love the locations of the tour! Can't wait to see where it goes next!! :)
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|have not tried it yet. there fore i am not sure how it works. how can you pring out what you draw?
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really like this game because it has a great story line and it makes you think as well as keeps you entertained. Thanks G5 I will definitely buy more games
B0089XH38M|3.0|have not had an issue so i guess it is working as it should. even though i have not any notification
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game makes it so u never want to put it down but at the same time it teaches u to wait for things which is very important in this generation where we all want more right here, right now.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|You know the fate of the main character early in the story and its equally as suspenseful. I was so intrigued to see how the events would unfold. The ending is so great as this fantastical setting intersects with the reality of life's next steps.  So many of the descriptions of life on the boat genuinely made me cringe and I loved the descriptions of the zoo and animal behavior.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire - this is so convenient and easy!!  Great to play anytime and anywhere.  Great way to pass the time.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|This movie is a campy and slick update to the Flash Gordon story.  The music by Queen is amazing.  Our family really enjoyed it.  We have watched it several times and find something new each time.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Increase size of digits to fill the screen. I can't play sounds and see the clock at the same time?
B009K86D86|5.0|Very comprehensive  and informative.  I realized that we need to read labels, be watchful of what to eat and to buy what is good for the body not what is cheap
B004EBBPU0|2.0|Val Kilmer probably deserves credit for his role portraying Morrison, but Morrison himself probably really didn't deserve the effort.  I couldn't finish this movie.  I made it most of the way, but got to a point where I didn't care any more.  If it shows Morrison's end, I didn't see it, but you would expect it, I think, with his overindulgence in alcohol and drugs.  I was disappointed to see Meg Ryan in the role she had; very unlike her.
B0081336FO|5.0|The only downside is now we have to wait for Season 3!! Cumberbatch is perfect as Sherlock and Watson is outstanding.
B001TM14VC|5.0|This movie reminds me favorably of some of the WWII era air stories.  Tom Cruise is good as the cocky fighter pilot, Val Kilmer is good as the other guy, the hotshot Cruise has to defeat for Top Gun honors.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My daughter and I never stop playing this.  We have one continuous game going.  It is so much fun be cause you can take your time, pick it up anytime or play as if facing each other, rapidly.  you don't have to be good at drawing, just good at getting your idea across.  We adore this game!
B000000OU0|5.0|So I know I've bought this album at least twice and I recently decided to buy it again.  An album has to really be good to buy it multiple times and I'm here to tell you this one certainly is worth a purchase or two or three.  After The Eagles reunited after a &#34;14 year vacation&#34; the came back with this rare and beautiful gem.  The old hits are here as well as a few new songs which by now are also considered greatest hits.  My personal favorites on the album are Wasted Time and Pretty Maids All in a Row.  Simply masterful.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up if its been awhile since you've visited Hotel California.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I really wanted this to work because there are so few games out there to play by yourself.  But, either I am too dumb to get it or the instructions are poor or the games is just not what I thought.  I just could not get it to actually work without having to work so hard at it.  Maybe ou will have better luck.  I surely did like the concept!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thought this was well written and honest about her lifes challenges. Great adventure story as well with West Coast feel.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I am addicted to the series, and missed seeing the latter episodes--thus I'm buying them on amazon.  The purchase process is very easy!  The video is slightly out of focus in places, but I can live with that.
0393345084|5.0|This is an excellent book. Although I can understand why some politicians (and defenders of politicians) don't like it, from an economics standpoint, it is a must-read. I have a University degree in economics and I know what Krugman says in this book is spot-on.
1401937519|5.0|At 56 years old, it is usual for me to have something I would now read to be life changing.  And these insights do not come from some self-proclaimed guru, but someone who was (at best) reluctant to even share her story.  Through Anita, I found that I have been chasing many of the wrong goals, which society has placed heavy value on, which has only cause me misery.  Anita tells us that things like social status or possessions are meaningless.  The only thing that really matters in the end is how much we have loved, how much have we uniquely become ourselves and how rich have we made the tapestries of our lives through our interactions with other people.<br /><br />Just one of many of Anita Moorjani's insights from the \\"end\\" of her life is on page 69: \\"Just look at my life path!  Why, oh why, have I always been so harsh with myself?  Why did I never stand up for myself and show the world the beauty of my own soul?  Why haven't I followed my own beautiful heart and spoken my own truth?\\"<br /><br />As Stephen Covey said, \\"Begin with the end in mind.\\"  If you believe that you will face a situation similar to that of Ms. Moorjani at the end of your life, shouldn't you begin to prepare for that eventuality now?  Wouldn't you like to have a preview of what that might be like?  How easy it is to get distracted and caught up in such trivial things that a week, month or even a decade from now, won't matter at all!  Why not share this experience with Anita Moorjani so that at the end of your life, you will be able to give yourself satisfactory answers?  After all, unlike Ms. Moorjani apparently thought at the time, you still have the time to write a different ending to the script of your life.<br /><br />I wish I could give this book six stars.  Even at the beginning of the book, when many authors recount the early days of their lives that lead up to the book's climax and really only seem to take up space in the book or to be of interest to themselves, \\"Dying to be Me\\" is different.  It is so fascinating to read of the introspections of a young person who is Indian growing up as a Hindu living in Hong Kong while attending a Catholic school. And each time Ms. Moorjani describes a situation, she paints such a beautiful word picture, she immediately draws you into the situation as though you are right there with her.<br /><br />I must admit, though, that I cheated!  While my wife read the book (and completed it in record time), I listened to Anita Moorjani read the words from her book aloud on my iPod as I completed my morning runs.  Listening to her emotion, diction and enunciation (given her varied culture and language influences) is a real treat!<br /><br />The best books inspire additional thoughts about your own life as you read them.  For example, through Anita Moorjani's wisdom I came to realize how important it is to treat your family with the love and respect that they deserve.  Do not be critical and judgmental of them.  Forgive them their idiosyncrasies and their faults as they forgive yours.  Because, in the end, they will be the only ones who will be there to support you in your time of need.<br /><br />This book is a must read and will be a definite comfort for anyone who has recently lost a loved one, is contemplating a difficult decision in their life, is approaching the end of their life, is afflicted with a disease or knows someone who is.erent.

B00402FGE4|5.0|I enjoyed this show when it was on television and feel that I may have missed some of this series. I would recommend this to others.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|I decided to rent this. Why not, I've seen just about every exorcism movie there is.<br />This one brings us another little girl who is plagued by a demon via a magic Jewish box meant to imprison it.<br />A new twist for sure but not enough to save an otherwise mediocre movie.<br />Body contortions, check.<br />A few J horror style scares that were lifted right from The Grudge.<br />The mom was the only really convincing actor.<br />The dad was annoying as were both daughters.<br />I recommend a rental to exorcism completists.<br />For everyone else...skip it.<br />This movie brings nothing new worth mentioning.<br />Satan should fire his agent because at this rate his street cred is going downhill fast.
B007SGM084|5.0|The whole pack is just awesome!!!<br />I recommend every adults to read and get themselves into the stories. I really don't want the stories to an end. The characters are magnificent.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I Like it  muchy muchy :-) Download it, use it, its very cool!!!!!! :-) You will also like it.Maybe even you will love it :-)
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Quick delivery no problems at all! Obviosly the same music when I had back in the 80's basically a no brainer if you like Van Halen Thank You
B007REV4YI|3.0|I think that the movie was a bit long and this may be because there are scenes that I have seen before in other 'chase ' movies.<br />Eg The rooftop chase very much as in Batman and I wonder how tiles can support a moving vehicle.<br />The chase in the cars through city streets and stalls, smashing through stock barrows has been filmed many times.<br />Bond gets shot twice yet when we see him again there are very mild bullet entry wounds on his body.<br />That's not realistic.<br />Shooting the woman with the whisky cup on her head was just unnecessary senseless killing for shock value and was violence for violence sake.<br />A cheap shot..!!<br />The photographic imagery in Shanghai might have been clever but I found it confusing.with all the coloured neons.<br />The biggest hole in the picture was in the final chapter where Q sets up a trail for the bad guys<br />to trace Bond and M.<br />Surely he had the brains to send the cavalry at the same time but no, Bond had to handle the mess himself with the help of an old gamekeeper.<br />Most persons I heard from liked the movie so maybe I was expecting more and more of a return to believability but no, I think it is returning to the old style of guns , girls and gadgets.<br />Give me back the two previous Bond movies thanks.<br />They were more realistic.<br /><br />Stan Chun<br />Wellington<br />New Zealand
1932100660|5.0|Most important reading for everyone.  When there is so much information out there pointing in one direction and another, this is solid, research based and simplifies the food choices humans should make.
0345525558|3.0|This book is highly readable and would be good for a book club.  My problems with it were; an insubstantial story, and lack of believable characters.  Good points were in the research done on the flowers, but I had a problem with the multiple meanings given to many of the flowers.  Such as one flower might have several very different meanings at the time the book was written, and these meanings seemed to change over the years.  I would certainly hate to base my relationships with people on the meanings of the flowers I sent them.  Other than that, as a story it was different and mildly interesting. I should qualify the believable character comment by saying, they seemed to good to be true.  No faults, unless non-communication is a fault. The main character had too many faults.  Maybe it was good nobody else seemed to have any.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Strong female characters, and strong sensitive guys are my favourite.<br /> We all love romance and happy endings, but this book did cover some very factual insight to what a woman in the eighteen century<br />prospects were. Thank God for the suffragette.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|interesting story but very confusing to follow at times. I felt they could have done alot more with the storyline that what they went with.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I have not read this book yet but it promises to be a good read.  I will be into it soon.
B00B2DSK06|3.0|It's one of the best movies ever. But when it's on the kindle fire hd, it doesn't show the best hd quality and sometimes while I watch it it starts to freeze up. The movie is awesome, just the quality, not so awesome.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Characters and hometown Philly description all so real and sweet, made me feel warm and at home! Fly Eagles Fly
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have an iPod and it works fine on my iPod. On my kindle, it's really slow and doesn't show good quality. I saw on my friend's Kindle Fire and it looked clear and it wasn't slow. That kindle fire was perfectly fine. My kindle, it doesn't show good quality. But overall, it's one of the most addictive games yet.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've been able to download videos with no problem at all. I also haven't had any porn ads come up (as other reviewers seem to point out), so they must have changed that recently. Great app!
B00A14SQBU|5.0|Heck yes Xtina!  I absolutely LOVE her voice -- and while this album is (generally) more of a &#34;dance album,&#34; you gotta give it to the girl -- she's got an AMAZING SET OF PIPES!<br /><br />I do love that she takes a serious side in the balad with Blake Shelton -- great lyrics and song.<br /><br />BUY THIS!  YOU WON'T REGRET!
B000001EUR|5.0|This is probably their best album, hands down! Perfectly displays the Scorpions in their heyday! Also, it is one of the best 80's CD's from that decade!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Teehee!<br /><br />OK -- the move was GREAT, and when I saw the soundtrack was available, I was worried it was just going to be a bunch of the &#34;background music songs&#34; from the movie (like all other soundtracks) --- or, that it wouldn't be all of the songs.  I was THRILLED that it was the songs sung in the movie!  (although, they did leave out a couple -- but no biggie, the best/biggest were there).<br /><br />SWEEEEET ALBUM!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is a wonderful refreshment from the average shows on TV nowadays. Very well-scripted, intelligent, funny, dramatic, and of course a healthy dose of romantic as well. I'm so addicted! Love it!
B001IFZL50|5.0|This is a great miniseries, I just rewatched it again and am amazed at the production quality of the show.  I am not fully sure of how real the story is or could be, but it does provide some interesting thoughts as to how military structure behaves (in both positive and negative ways)
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Like most books now days this story was familiar and shared similarities to stories like Marata Eros's A Terrible Love, but that doesn't mean its not worth reading. I loved the characters, their dysfunctions and the constant battle between Travis and Abby. Give it a go you'll love it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Such a beautifully written love story! Once started this book I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read my next Jamie Mcquire book!
B0018QXL1K|5.0|I am and have always been a big fan of this group. I love this cd all the songs on here a great!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Easy read. Could not put down so definitely worth it.  Thought it was better than Gone Girl!  Very interesting ending
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|i beat the road and right when i beat it slender popped up but i luckly beat it before he got there
B004OZZ624|5.0|Excellent - very well written. I could watch this again and see even more. The character development is good, the plot believeable and the acting was supberb.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You will get addicted. It is very entertaining. At the beginning it was slow but once you get the hang if everything you will some fun.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Acting was outstanding. Funny and Very touching and human. Not sure the priest role was believable but William Macy is great anyway. Helen Hunt's relationship with her husband was a bit of a mystery and why she choose this profession.  Seemed that she had issues of her own that were unresolved. Another movie I suppose. It would be nice to think the &#34;happy&#34; ending that results in a lovely companion meets most of our hopes and dreams. Not usually the case so maybe a more realistic ending would have been more honest and powerful. Still worth seeing.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is a great book and takes alot of patience because it is a large book. If you enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, adventure, and interesting reading, this book would be good for you list of books to read.  We are using it for a sci fi literature class on dystopic scifi at college and am currently writing a paper on it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every minute of this book. It is Action packed and great story! I can't wait to start book 2!!
B00181JGI2|5.0|the dude abides and abides and will always abide.  have watched it 9 times and will watch it more.  what a classically great movie.  throw CITIZEN KANE in the trash and start studying this, movie schools!!
B004W1GCNC|3.0|I have not seen the original series, and after watching this episode, I think I will go back and watch the original. As a first episode, there was a lot if character building; making this episode plod along. One if the main characters comes from the original series, which is what makes me want to go back and watch those first - it felt like some inside joke I was missing out on.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Great movie.  Had my eyes watering towards the end.  Will add to my collection. Would recommend to friends and family.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Now this is a game that gets addictive you can move it all around to try and find a match. I would suggest this one to anybody that likes a fast packed game that isn't hard to play.My granddaughter was playing she really was getting into it
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Typical Reacher novel.  Always entertaining and you want to read more.  Know what the big guy is going to do next.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The app works perfectly, and it was FREE!  Easy to download and install, two thumbs up on this one.  Very satisfied.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great CD...every song on it is awesome!!! I heard the song &#34; I Will Wait&#34; and loved it...bought this CD and every song on it is just as good.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Like all his other works this is another uplifting story from mitch albom. I always have to read his books in one sitting.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Riordan has creat the perfect world of fantasy. A great book, and perfect close to the series.  Recommend for all ages.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Fun loving and imaginative! Peter Jackson captured The Hobbit and not Lord of the Rings which was an excellent choice.
1616550414|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of The Legend of Zelda needs this book. It gives information and concept art and backstory and a full timeline and stuff and SQUEEEEEEEEEEE :D Buy this product!
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|I will not purchase due to the ultraviolet copy. In my experience, ultraviolet only allows you to stream movies off of a internet connection, which I don't always have. I will buy on iTunes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|LOVE this app...my favorite part of this app are the various devotional plans! Just a wonderful app I would certainly recommend.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|good movie, made more for adults then for children as far the plot. worth watching - enjoy the movie now i am carring on to make sure i have enough words for the review
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love the variety and the different levels.  The colours and pictures are stunning.  Lots of fun!  Hours of enjoyment for everyone!!
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|This really happened during a period of time when I was serving in the military.  It shows how difficult it was to get a group of people out of Iran during a similar period covered by the film Argo.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|awesome , great , exciting worth every penny and then some , cant put it down , the movie does it justice
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I know this game is super fun but why I have to give it a 4/four is cause its a timer game what ever it is and e and for me I have downloaded ed so many games but I delete them from my device and I had over 30 game a while ago but I deleted some game s so now I have only 19 games and my device is still tuning low so I toy this game that's a device saver thing so I read every body's rates so I got it and it really helped and it tpld me all the games tabs I needed to give! sway. so that's how I toy it and now a raye from me: 
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is one of the better games available on the Kindle HD. The economy system and the two parks will keep you busy for hours. The missions are standard, and the dinosaurs are pretty cool.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  My 30 something boyfriend and I both loved it!  A great story of good triumphs over evil and children's hopes and dreams.....plus beautifully animated.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|No character development and the story is OK. To bad it is only down hill after this book.  The next booki is even worse.
B00BYOEMTQ|1.0|Rented the movie, stopped displaying video part way through, had to restart Unbox.  Video quality was so poor it was a constant distraction.  Quad core HTPC with 8 GB RAM... not a hardware problem on my end.
B009YMO6SM|3.0|This movie started out good but the ending was kind of disappointing. I don't think this is one to buy just rent it.

B007L6VR6M|5.0|I wonder this every time I see one of his films. His films are so different from every thing else out there in theaters. I think Rushmore is possibly the best film made in the last twenty years. It's so good I still laugh and cry every time I see it.That film speaks to everything that makes your youth so special and I think this film has caught that same sense of magic and wonder. Wes ,who is now years older than he was when he made Rushmore,still hasn't forgotten what it means to be young and to find out what a \\"life\\" on this planet is really all about. From his screenplays to the actors,esp. Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman,his two cinematic alter egos,the music,the colors,the deadpan yet heartfelt dialog,I can't help but wonder where did this guy come from? Wherever it was,I'm glad he found his way the the movies. I for one ,will be waiting with baited breath for whatever the man does next. Do yourself a favor and watch a Wes Anderson film. If you find out at the end,you didn't like,well,everybody has to grow up sometime,I guess. Me,I hope it's never!<br />Magnificent stuff!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Anyone unsure of whether to read this or not? Don't be. This is probably the greatest book I've read since Rick Riordan's \\"The Lightning Thief\\". It's truly inspiring, hilarious, and heart warming. Not only do you get the main character, August's POV, you also hear from many other people impacted by Auggie. I HIGHLY recommend this book no matter what age you are.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Love how it tied the other three in, without missing a beat, and still making it it's own story.. Great action flick with good fight scenes!
B00A83075M|4.0|Wreck it Ralph(released Oct/12)stars the voice talents of,among others,John C. Reilly as Wreck-It Ralph,Sarah Silverman as Vanellope von Schweetz,Jack McBrayer as Fix-It Felix, Jr.,Jane Lynch as Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun and Alan Tudyk as King Candy.This is a nicely done effort by the Disney Studios which I found generally to be an enchanting and entertaining opus.Kids from the 80s,now grown ups with kids themselves,will especially relate to the old style video arcade games that are revisited on screen.<br />The story introduces us to a video arcade and one game in particular,Fix it Felix.The nemesis of the game is Wreck it Ralph.He sits high atop an apartment building and tries to wreck it.The hero Felix's schtick is to undo all the damage Ralph does.Something very similar to Donkey Kong.We soon go inside the game to see what happens after the arcade shuts down.Ralph's \\"home\\" is the nearby garbage dump,while Felix lives in the apartment building surrounded by many friends.The schism that exists causes Ralph to attend a \\"bad-anon\\" meeting to talk out his frustrations with other\\"baddies\\".The motto of the group is to take things\\"one game at a time\\".When Ralph returns home that night a party is in progress at the apartment building.It seems Felix and his friends are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the game.Ralph weasels himself an invite,but after an argument ensues with some tenants he storms out.After every game Felix gets a medal for winning.Ralph thinks that if he got one his street cred would rise considerably.<br />Ralph leaves the game and goes to game central.Along the way he bumps into a soldier from Hero's Duty who has PTSD big time.After learning that one gets a medal for winning in the game,he\\"borrows\\" the soldiers suit and joins the game.Ralph soon finds out it is harder than it looks,and after bumbling through his first play the group all leave to the start line again.Ralph learns the medal he seeks is in a tall tower.Ralph climbs the tower and gets himself the medal.However on his way out he steps on an egg which spawns a bug,which immediately clings to his face.This causes Ralph to fall into a spacecraft which flies away and eventually crash lands in a game called Sugar Rush.The female leader of the Hero's Rush game and Felix,who has shown up looking for Ralph,also follow him.<br />In Sugar Rush Ralph's medal has ended up on the branch of a candy cane tree.On his climb up he meets a \\"glitch\\".When she/the glitch realizes what he's after she steals it away from him and runs off.She uses Ralph's medal to enter herself in the upcoming kart race.But the King is dead set against her racing and he tries everything to stop her.Meanwhile Ralph catches up to glitch and they come to terms with each other.In return for Ralph helping her enter and win the race,she will give Ralph his medal back.The two create a candy go kart and practice her driving.Just before the two are about the leave for the race,glitch goes back to get something for Ralph.At this moment the King shows up and gives Ralph his medal back.He also asks Ralph to stop glitch from racing.His reasoning is if she won,the entire game itself would likely be shut down when human players saw her glitching out constantly.When glitch returns he wrecks the kart and returns home,leaving poor glitch in tears.<br />Back home practically everyone has gone,as Ralph's disappearance has left the game unplayable.As Ralph stares at the out of order sign,he throws his medal at the playing screen which has the effect of partially dropping the sign on the outside.At that moment Ralph sees a picture of glitch on the side of her game across the arcade.Funny that a glitch should be shown prominently on a game she shouldn't be in.<br />Ralph returns to Sugar Rush to learn that the King deliberately made her a glitch,tearing her memory from the system code,long ago.Ralph finds glitch locked up in a \\"fungeon\\" and releases her,after some apologies.The race begins and even though shestarts late,glitch hits the road running.The race never quite finishes as the bug that accompanied Ralph into Sugar Rush has now grown and spawned an army of them.Felix and the commander of Hero's Duty finally catch up with Ralph and assist him in fending off the bug attack.It is during this time we learn the King is also the hero from an old game called Turbo Time,who took over and killed off a similar game way back when,and has now ruled this one for years.The two battle,the King goes down along with the army of bugs, and Ralph gets to finally push glitch over the finish line.This reboots the game and glitches former role of the princess of the game is reinstated.Ralph returns home a happier more loved bad guy and glitch and he remain best friends forever.<br />Many who watch this and are familiar with the old arcade games,will meet a myriad of old friends here like Sonic the Hedge Hog,Cubert,Bowser(from Mario),Pacman and more.It is obvious what demographic the producers of this film were after.It also works wonderfully with children as most of the characters here are thoroughly benign in behaviour and looks.That is why I say in the title that it is like Reboot,but without that animation's edge to it.The only fault I find with animation such as this is in the writing.The stories tend to get a little too complicated,and as the film winds down there are alot of loose ends to tie up,and some extras added on.Such as the side plot of the King and his past.If they had left it with just the King trying to marginalize glitch,that would have been sufficient.But instead they made the King into the guy from Turbo Time.All this while Felix and company are fighting bugs and Ralph is fighting for his life.I did think it was a neat touch that the King's affectation was along the lines of old comedian Ed Wynn.In fact kudos to all who voiced the film.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.The only extra is the 10 minute animated short The Paperman,seen in theatres along with this film.<br />All in all an enjoyable animated romp back to the heady days of arcade games of the 80s.Fix it Felix bears more than a striking resemblance to the Donkey Kong of old.Kids from the 80s,now grown up,will relate to the subject matter easily,and their children will love the film for its adventuresome theme and larger than life characters.Recommended.starts late,glitch hits the road running.The race never quite finishes as the bug that accompanied Ralph into Sugar Rush has now grown and spawned an army of them.Felix and the

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was great! The animations were good, the characters looked like the actors who did the voices, and had a ton of hilarious parts.
B000FC1PNE|4.0|the story continues the adventures of the Bridgerton clan.  It is a delightful romp with the added attraction of Julia Quinn's snappy patter.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  Kate Beckinsale delivers as always.  Excellent special effects and story line, just hope they come out with another movie to tie up the loose ends .  Would recommend to everyone.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|An exciting, fast paced read. Only lacking 1 star because as I finish, I feel I have a lot of questions about the last major scene. I don't feel closure as I find myself asking &#34;How?&#34;, and struggling to work out details that were lacking.
0440180295|2.0|I honestly did not find anything enjoyable about this book. It was one of the weirdest books that I have ever read and makes me not even want to consider reading another of the author's books. If I could describe this book in one word it would be &#34;weird.&#34; I only read this because it was listed on the Art of Manliness Top 100 books for men to read. I understand now why this book has been banned, the fatalistic anti free-will theme is very depressing and completely untrue. Perhaps I am not imaginative or creative enough to enjoy this genre. I prefer straight forward stories that make sense rather than disjointed flashbacks/flash forwards.<br /><br />It is a fast read, I finished it within a few hours and I will keep it. Perhaps a future rereading will enlighten me? I doubt it. So it goes.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Wow, this game is definitely worth the asking price. The visuals while at first  only seem retro are actually 3d and looks totally cool. The gameplay is top notch as well
B000SEGHT6|5.0|A quick, worthwhile read.  It was recommended to me first in high school, I wish I read it then.  Vonnegut does not waste any words.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best.thank you who ever had this idea and creaters.you have to get a screensaver for this game.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you enjoyed Season 1, you will continue to enjoy the second season.  It doesn't vary too much from the book series.  And as always the books are better.  (You learn more.)  granted the back stories in the book can get a bit long winded at times.  The story progression is a bit bizarre but that's what makes it work.  A must have for fan collectors.<br /><br />JRM
B00B7IJBUY|4.0|You can go back and read my review of \\"The Circle\\" from a few years ago, and you can see I panned it pretty thoroughly. I stand by that review still to this day. I had a store credit at a big box retailer, and after my disappointment with \\"The Circle\\", getting this album for free was the only way I'd give it a shot. I just saw them in concert two weeks ago in Nashville, and wasn't overly impressed with what I heard from the new album, but again, in this case, it was free, so I picked it up.<br /><br />As a fan since 1986, I am happy to report, actually, I'm thrilled to report, I think this album is MUCH better than \\"The Circle\\". Of course, a lot of people think Bon Jovi is going to release \\"Slippery Part Two\\" or \\"New Jersey Part Two\\" and...that just ain't gonna happen. As much as some of you (us) may want that, it's just unrealistic. Times change, people change, music changes. For as much as I may want \\"Slippery Part Two\\", let's be honest here...if they did that, it would probably sound silly and contrived. These guys are all over 50 now, and their world view and music view is different than it was 27 years ago (my views and opinions on everything are different than they were 27 years ago). It's time to give up that dream of recapturing 1986.<br /><br />In 2013, this is what Bon Jovi has put out there, and it's a good rock and roll album. It's not a GREAT rock and roll album, but it is good. Jon and Richie's voices are cooked. They can't hit those high notes anymore, (the price you pay for extensive touring, smoking, and drinking) and they don't try to do it here. But at least this album has got some good mid-tempo tracks that are likely to get stuck in your head. \\"Because We Can\\", \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Pictures Of You\\", \\"That's What The Water Made Me\\", \\"What's Left Of Me\\", and \\"Beautiful World\\" are all good mid-tempo toe-tappers. Are they great? No. There's nothing on this album you will mistake for \\"Bad Medicine\\" or \\"Living On a Prayer\\". No chance of that. But they're good, catchy songs. I also like \\"What About Now\\" and \\"With These Two Hands\\", although I think they're a step below the others listed here. If you like ballads, there are plenty of those here, I'm just usually not a fan of the slower stuff.<br /><br />In truth, this may only be a 3 star album, but after the disappointment I felt with \\"The Circle\\", maybe I'm just overly excited right now about how much better I like this album than \\"The Circle\\". For the Bon Jovi faithful (who are going to buy this album anyway), it's definitely recommended. If you haven't bought a Bon Jovi album since \\"Keep The Faith\\", this is a good one to pick up. If you're just waiting for 1986 to roll back around, you should probably skip this album.good, catchy songs.

B0090SI3ZW|5.0|but for the type if you enjoy Kung Fu classics, you love this.  Unfortunately no actualy nudity, which for me was a bit disappointing but hey, you can't have everything.  Normally I don't like rap, but it actually works with this piece.  You have to love this type, it's like an Asian flavored spaghetti Western.  A must have for your Kung Fu Myth and Legends collection.<br /><br />JRM
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't even begin to express how much I loved this book. Simply, heartbreakingly beautiful and I loved every single word written.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I bought it, paid full price, was excited to read it, as I love Harry Potter. The book, from the beginning, was hard to follow, painfully confusing. I didn't like one thing about it. Had to force myself to finish it.
B001NZXI5U|3.0|I personally should have listened to the songs first... because I would have likely just purchased a few of them instead of the full album.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I would give this book 5 Stars. Exciting and action packed with many interesting  twists and turns. Hard to put down.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Had to be one of the most mind blowing stories I have ever read. Such a compelling and awesome read I couldn't put it down.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|This show has great character development! This particular episode was worth buying instead of waiting on the last DVD in Netflix.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Once again, Daniel Craig plays a great James Bond :) ......Action packed & keeps me wanting more!! Can't wait for the next one
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Perfect for sleeping or meditation.  I use this app everyday and I have not experienced any negitives.  I would highly reccommend this app.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|There are authentic kung-fu movies like &#34;Iron Monkey&#34;. There are westernized spin offs like &#34;Time Cop&#34;. And finally there are schlock kung-fu movies like this one.  I was fooled by the presense of Russell Crowe in the cast. He is slumming. This is a real junk movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game.  do not like the pop-up that advertise numerous products.<br /><br />Is there a way to get rid of them?
B00BF11STU|3.0|I found \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" stiff and disappointing. Katherine Bigelow had a tough challenge-- to create a fast-paced, awe-inspring film from a series of events which were in real-life terms,  long-drawn-out, tedious, and underwhelming.  Torture--aka enhanced interrogation-- was the film's high water mark. Bigelow set out to create a compelling flesh-and- blood hero --one that proved to be an awkward attempt at replicating Sargent James, Bigelow's hero in the Hurt Locker. During the torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty, our heroine stood in the shadows.  She is billed as tough and ruthless. We were left wondering about this for much of the early part of the film. I remember reading reviews of \\"Hurt Locker\\" written by soldiers who served in Iraq. They gave Bigelow high marks for capturing the look and feel of Iraq. What this film lacked are the intangibles...the bewildering fog of war and how individual personalities fit into all of this. The raid of Bin Ladin's house was fuzzy, chaotic, and disjointed. Did it really happen this way ?  Not sure.  The ending of the film was pure \\"Hollywood. \\"  After reading a few of the remarkable number of glowing reviews here, I wonder if it seems unpatriotic to write a negative review of this story. Locating and killing Bin Laden was an historic event--an important victory, not only because he was considered a powerful man, clearly a threat to the US. His capture also marked the beginning of discrete searches for our enemies vs our country's dedication to massive engagements involving hundreds of thousands of troops and needless loss of life. Sadly, we're leaving behind largely embittered populations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  Zero Dark Thirty reminds us how brutal, bleak, and uncivilized we've become in our attempts to stand our ground in a part of the world where we are out of our league and can't win by fighting our wars on our own terms.
B003L77G8I|5.0|price right. love the show. watch it all the time with the kids and grandkids. can't wait to get the next seasons
B00127RAJY|3.0|The work outs are spot on.. I wasn't aware that I would not be able to start the video and start working out within a minute.....you cannot fast forward to the menu, you have to listen to Jillian tell you a bunch of hoopla before you are &#34;allowed&#34; to start the workout - which seems like an eternity - probably at least 3 -4 minutes.  It's extremely annoying and when you buy a dvd, you should be able to peruse through it to get to where you want to start.  Again, very annoying.  workout is excellent.  Jillian - you need to shut out the advertisements.. I won't buy again.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|price right. love the show. watch it all the time with the kids and grandkids. can't wait to get the next seasons
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Found this book to be a wonderful young love story, a great mystery, and compelling insight to a young girl who strength blossoms when she meets an incredible young man.  Don't throw this novel in with all the other typical love stories,  this book is anything but typical!  Enjoyed it greatly!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like the game, but would like it more if there was a shorter time to regenerate the con replenish feature.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves is the latest progression in a series of exciting, yet intellectual novels from two of my favorite authors, with one of my favorite characters.  Entertainment and education with a drumbeat pace, intriguing characters and eloquent prose.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome it is everything you do with a real horse! I love it if want to buy a app about horse buy this one!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I randomly stumbled upon this show on amazon and have been obsessed ever since. If you enjoy crime dramas and have a good ear, the British accents can be tough at times, then you will love this show. The characters are very engaging and the writing is excellent. Each episode can be watched over and over again. I own both seasons and will buy the third when it comes out.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and we both listen it too it constantly.  Great CD - only just a couple of songs that aren't our favorite, all the rest - amazing!
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|I love the movies, in reading the book you find out so much more of what was going on that the movies just couldn't include.
B003MAOTP2|5.0|This was an epic movie. Filled with a lot of action towards the end with twists along the way. It keeps you entertained and interested I loved it. Great movie
B00A2H9L2E|2.0|I loved the original Silent Hill, so I anticipated the follow up Silent Hill Revelation. After watching this movie, I must say I was very disapointed. This movie was nothing like the first one. It failed on story, scares and creepiness! I found it to be a complete waste of money!
B0091XRL0E|5.0|The storyline is very good with some amusing jokes - one can definitely see that the film is made by the same people who made the Wallace and Grommet films.
B00BF123WG|5.0|A Gripping and very well done drama based on 9-11 and the aftermath that followed.<br />Despite the liberal media bias, I think the harsh interrogation of terrorist provided the info we needed to eventually kill Usama bin Ladin.<br /><br />Having been waterboarded during military training myself, I know it works. It worked in helping finding bin Ladin.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Although the animation is very good, I did not watch the film all the way through as I found it to be somewhat boring, light and definitely targeting female viewers....
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was very sad. But a spectacular movie! Different, I loved it. Great little twist at the end. Don't want to give away to many detials, but I like the suspence towards the end, where you have too choose.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Although I found the whole concept of Lincoln as a Vampire hunter somewhat strange, I decided to give this film a try.<br />The film was a true action film from beginning to end (read it more as the Matrix in the American civil war with Indiana Jones thrown in than as a horror film), the acting quality was very high indeed and the special effects were very good without being overpowering.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Awesome movie at an awesome price, true to Ludlum writing form. Nothing better to in a winter day then a Bourne marathon. Also with the UltraViolet I don't have to tie up space on my iPad, can't beat that.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I just got the app I did not no anything till I played it. I was great.. I loved it.
B002KEZ96Y|4.0|Very funny one of the best old school movies of all time if you haven't seen it is a must see movie
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has a great story line, as well as good graphics. I couldn't wait for the ending. It is a must buy!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has got me on grip for hours on end anyone who is thinking of buying this game get it it is so amazing.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, gripping right to the last line. One Two Tree Four Five!
B000HKYN74|5.0|All the startrek movies and TV showes tell us about real life experances.And if you listen closley they will show you how to cope with them.All you need to do is open your mind.You would truley be amazed at what you can learn.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Similar to Kunundrum. Pleasing to those who prefer games that are untimed and allow repeated retries to get itright or to improve a prior score.  Once a series of 12 puzzles are solved, you can watch the solution you came up with.  Coins awarded for minimum move solutions can be used to show a slution you can't get. Very nice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good storyline,  No bad language.  enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Near the end it was hard to put down,
B00BG08FKK|1.0|I am a big fan of LesMis - but this version was a bust. The production itself was lavishly well done, but with all the wonderful voices around and, not doubt, available, it is a mystery ro me why a bunch of Hollywooders were picked to head the cast.<br /><br />Ann Hathaway was, perhaps, the biggest disappointment. The surprise was that both Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman were not all that bad (not to day that they were Broadway caliber) --  AND Colm Wilkinson, one of the better Jean Valjean, was hidden away as the bishop!! What a shame.
143911000X|5.0|I got this for my 15 year old nephew & I also got him a Bro Code t-shirt to go with it. The book was in great condition & no obvious signs that it was used. He was very impressed!<br /><br />Book arrived quickly & I would recommend this seller.

The book arrived in great condition & didn't notice any problems with it all, I wouldn't have been able to tell that it was used.<br /><br />I thought the book was fantastic & really funny. There is a scene written with two people in the woods that I thought was just so wonderfully written.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book & this seller.
0307951529|2.0|I was specifically looking for a business idea that would fit in with my &#34;retirement&#34; plans.  This book was of little help for my purposes.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I got this for my Brother in law. It arrived in great conditon & no visible scratches, which I'm always nervous about when I order a used movie. The case looked brand new too. I was very pleased.<br /><br />The movie arrived quickly. I would recommend this seller.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|So much has already been written about this series. I only first watched it in March 2013. I watched every free moment I had (on my Kindle which look fantastic btw). There wasn't one actor that I could say didn't nail their role. I loved this series and it has inspired me to learn much more about the Tudors, which I am currently doing. If, by some small chance, you've never seen this series, drop everything and watch it. You will find yourself dreaming of Kings, Lords and Vassals.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This game has some truly amazing graphics, animations, and sound effects.<br /><br />The object of the game is to race multiple trains around the tracks and get them to their proper destination all the while avoiding other trains and various obstacles. It takes a lot of hand-eye coordination to watch all the racing trains, flip the track switches, blow up debris on the tracks, and stop the trains at crossings.<br /><br />Sounds fun and exciting, but it actually got a little boring after a while.  On the harder levels it only takes you a few tries to figure out the routes needed to get all the trains safely to their destination, and once you figure out the path it is only a matter of perfecting your timing of switch flipping.  At this point it got a little boring.  Some of the tracks took several attempts to get the timing right, and with each attempt everything stayed exactly the same: music, graphics, speed of the trains, paths of the trains.  It just got a little monotonous.  If something would have changed with each attempt (even if it was only a change in the graphics, music or animation) it might have kept my attention longer.<br /><br />So a truly beautiful work of art and an amazing show of programming skills, but needs some tweaks to keep the user's interest from waning.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|and i dont particularly like that the game lets you dump off all the work on poor Dan, or skip it by paying.... this is for my 6 year old daughter, so let it be realistic about all the work of caring for a horse..... 90 percent work and 10 percent fun.
B008B92U32|5.0|A fun game to play on Friday night's with family. You take a picture or select a  previous picture and press swap. It's easy and fun. (Here is something easy to do take a pic of someone's face and then of the back of someone's head then swap. It looks like a monster!) :) Thank you
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I was hooked the very first time I played it....it's my new fave game...love the bright colors & tile designs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hey this is Downton Abbey, who wouldn't love it.  Even men get hooked on this one.  Really good acting.  Need to start at season 1 to understand the characters.  Great show.
B0027MJU00|5.0|So suspenseful and twisted, so, of course, I loved it! Unlike the other two I've read by her (Gone Girl & Sharp Objects) but just as good.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was such a good book.  It caught my imagination and made me root for Harold.  It was believable and brought forth his quirks as well as his strengths and weaknesses.  Good story line with several underplots!
0061122416|5.0|Its been a long long time since I have read this book. But I still remember the same day when I bought it. It was sitting on a best sellers list of my local book store and I thought it had a cool castle cover so I bought it. Little did I know that later that month the girl I was deeply in love with would decide to leave me. It was at this point I started reading The Alchemist. Out of all the sadness from that part in my life I have to give credit to this book for helping me get through on my own. Lots of people only recommend this book to those young enthusiasts who are just entering or leaving college. That is wrong. I recommend this book to any human being who has a will to live.
B00BF123WG|4.0|This is a thoughtful film that emphasizes to importance of persistency and consistency of research by a dedicated analyst. It doesn't underplay the importance of dedicated intelligence resources or the professionalism and dedication of the Seal Teams and their specialized Army pilots, but it does rightly balance the importance of the preceding research and the frustrating and time consuming<br />process that is involved with the intense on the scene bravery and professionalism of the &#34;operators&#34;.<br /><br />The film also touches on the controversial use of &#34;enhanced interrogation&#34; techniques but it balanced this with moral qualms of those individuals using or observing these methods which are now banned.  Nevertheless, my subjective take was that the film did not imply that these were critical to the gathering of intelligence by other means or to the capture/killing of Bin Laden himself. After reading other reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to see the importance given to professionalism of a dedicated analyst and to the use and correlation of information obtained from more conventional and humane data collection techniques.
B000FA5STS|3.0|The book seems to drag....I found myself getting bored.  So many charcters I have to to go back to see who is who. Baldacci's The Winner is so much better..
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I think this has become my new favorite book! I think the story is just as relevant here and now as it was in nineteenth century France.
B0073PPKNM|2.0|I'm sure Melody Gardot is experimenting, as is her right being a talented artist. Well, this one failed ... Except for a couple of tracks, nothing stands out. Her voice is drowned behind copacabana type songs which IMO are not a good match for her.<br />Better luck next time!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Best Angry Birds of all.  Lots of fun with new birds added.  Can spend hours at a time if I'm not careful.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Catching reading. Fascinating plot; excellently developped; superbly documented. All three parts smoothly connected. Kindle version needs some more proof reading.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|There's no satisfaction in playing a game that's too difficult to figure out.  It does not compare to other Angry Bird versions.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Excitement race each other like heartbeats cliff hanger ending though with anabeth and Percy  falling into Tartarus  and the rest of the 7 go to the house of hades.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love playing this game on my kindle fire challenging yet fun. only complaint is the diamonds are hard to come by.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Nothing too detailed to say. Just a good fun book. The Smart Ass humour of the main character is very much my cup of tea....
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVE this show!!  Can't wait for seaon 4.  The character development, staging, and story lines are fabulous.  Reminds me of a Jane Austen story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has been as great as everyone else has been saying. I finally broke down and joined the bandwagon and love it. I've watched all 3 seasons in 2 weeks and can't wait for the next new episode. 5stars and highly recommended.
B0078ZTWP4|3.0|First, I give this lantern 5 stars for illumination.  The brightness is more than efficient to light up a room.  Second, I deduct 1 star because of the difficulty of attaching the base to the battery compartment. Third, I deduct 1 star for the unnecessary continuous blinking of the green LED light.  It is very annoying.  There is no reason for this feature and I assume eventually it will use up the batteries..  If you cannot locate the lantern in the dark then you have a problem.  I purchased this product for the primary purpose of using it in the event of a power outage.  Because of the constant blinking of the green LED light, I keep the lantern unplugged because it may be months before there will be a power outage and I can't stand the constant blinking.  In the event of a power outage it is going to be very difficult to attach the base to the battery compartment especially in the dark.  They should get rid of the blinking and improve the base connection.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Very nicely made .. My 5 yr old daughter could follow it till the end. One of the good kids movie from Disney to watch.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. Endless opportunities to keep the story line new and exciting.
B000002JSJ|3.0|This album is a mix of their earlier style and the jazzier style from later in their career. &#34;For Your Life&#34; and &#34;Nobodys Fault But Mine&#34; are the early Led Zeppelin that I love. &#34;Tea for One&#34; is good and bluesy.
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|Michael Fassbender is terrific in this edgy drama. Don't let the nudity and sexual situations put you off - great acting!
B000002KHH|5.0|Awesome 2nd album. Almost as great as the 1st. My favorite songs are &#34;War Pigs&#34; and &#34;Fairies Wear Boots&#34;. Such political and social commentary from a hard rock band.
6305558167|4.0|A little different from some of the King Arthur movies.  Overall, good performances from all the actors.  This movie is has Merlin as more of a main character.
B00631VJIC|3.0|I love the show's theme song &#34;This Life&#34; but the rest of the songs are only okay and better serve as mood music or subtext during the show.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I'm glad I purchased this app! I use it all the time to see how much of a charge I have. It's accurate and I know exactly when I have to charge my kindle fire hd. It's great! I recommend this app.
B000002JSP|4.0|This album doesn't have any 5 star songs, but all the song s are 2 to 4 stars. &#34;In the Evening&#34;, &#34;All of My Love&#34; and &#34;I'm Gonna Crawl&#34; are the best on this album.
0316223239|5.0|A sent for a Spanish version for my daughter but arrived in English.At first time I was to return it,but then I gave it as a gift to a friend.The English version was great,love the author and the way she wrotte...The Hobbit had no arrive yet
B000002KE2|2.0|Compared to the first three albums, this one was a let down, All the songs are sub par. I would not recommend this album to anyone.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie was a little confusing and lacked as much action as I would have liked, but in the end really enjoyed it!<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi and time travel movies.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|If you only wanted to buy one CD (double) of Led Zeppelin this is the one. Every song is a 4 or 5 star song from their best.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool 1-5-One of the best SciFi books I have read/ listened to in a long time. Some writers use graphic sexual content to draw their readers in, (I HATE THAT) but this guy uses an actual talent for writing. A richly descriptive  environment that sucks you in and does not let you go. Will be looking for any silo that he cares to write about, 15, 32, 43, what ever.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|Over all a solid CD. &#34;Tighten Up&#34; and &#34;Howlin For You&#34; are the stand outs. Roots rock at its best.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing. It told a story full of unexpected twists and turns, and a story of unconditional love. Safe Haven is one of the best books I have ever read, and brought me to tears. The love of the characters makes this story very powerful. Nicholas Sparks has sure outdone himself.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bob Seger is quintiscential American Rock N Roll song writer and performer. His lyrics are so well crafted and tell stories that many have also experienced. Plus, the melodies enhance the songs by creating a symbiotic mood to match the lyrics.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|There are quite a few twists and turns in this book and they change the sympathies you have for the characters. This is wrongfoots the reader several times and is skillfully done. I did not care much for the ending. It is not clear what the morals of the author are. Both main characters are very flawed, one a sociopath, the other a ethics free lightweight and the  deserve one another, but the book does not give any kind of catharsis which it really needs.
B005URRCUY|4.0|My 2nd favorite CD by the Black Keys. &#34;Lonely Boy&#34; is the best on this CD. Dan Auerbach can really make his guitar talk, moan or growl.Patrick Carney has a way of creating a driving rhythmic beat with a minimalist yet essential style.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is fun, really fun.  It is a mental challenge and can keep me on my kindle for hours and hours.
B000002JSR|2.0|I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan, but this CD had only three songs that were even somewhat interesting. It seems that the group progressed toward a more jazzy style than I expected. The Led Zeppelin that I rave about is represented by their first 6 albums when their style was based more in the blues-rock genre.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|landing sequence was grate. the plot, setting and dialog was amaising. loved the strang allien as well the ending where she took the ship and went exploring
B000002KB8|5.0|Thoroughly great album! Have it on vinyl from the 70's. This is a breakthrough album. The eerie and dark melodies and lyrics started a new sub-genre of rock.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Great Sci-Fi Space Opera.  Honor is a character worth following.  Plenty of good plot twists and turns.  The whole series is worth it!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|My hubby watched this movie with my father and he said that he enjoyed this movie. Would purchase this again.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I always enjoy reading books that became movies but in this book's case, the movie probably gets the message across better. This read was ok,  just ok.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|When I first read the title I said to myself, &#34;what in the world!&#34; But, when watching this movie, I was like I'd watch it again. It turned out to be a good movie.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Fast from the factory but it can be easily overclocked! Im using this CPU for gaming and it is working great! Intel FTW on this product!
B00BESLHEA|5.0|My husband begged me to order this movie since he is an action movie guru. I did not want to watch it at first, but gave in and did watch it. Pretty good movie.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The story line is good. It moves right along. I rate this book five stars because it sheds much light on the often underestimated power of cyberwarfare and how it can be conducted. We should all be aware of the threat the author addresses.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|No disrespect to Bruce Willis, but this movie put me to sleep and my hubby watched the rest of it!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Such a powerful story of one's will to win. Reading the story from Enzo's point of view is amazing. I would recommend this book to any animal lover.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|This movie is action packed! I liked it from the beginning to the end! If you like action this is the movie for you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addicting. It is simple enough, on the lower levels, for children to play, yet challening enough for adults.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|First few seasons were the best, but still an all-time favorite. Great charater development. Hats off to the wardrobe team - superb job!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|JT never fails to impress, and this album was sure worth the wait. If you buy one album this whole year, PLEASE buy this one!!!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Got this for my 9 year old when we didn't have paper to draw on while on vacation...she LOVES it.  It keeps her occupied and she loves that she can save her projects to an album.  Definitely worth the money!
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|Regina Spektor has such a beautiful and unique voice, paired with her lyrics and piano, it makes for one wonderful album! Buy this!!!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Seven years in the waiting for a new album from Justin Timberlake. I have to admit I was, definitely, expecting the whole album to be a &#34;Get Up Off your Feet and Dance for Hours&#34; as what most of his music has always done for me...however, this album was a huge surprise and still, as always, JT did not disappoint. He pulled together so many genres of music's history and created a new one...I cannot wait for the second part of this album later this year! This is a must have album all the way!
B000002H97|5.0|The reason why I got into Metallica was because of this album! Every song is awesome and I blast it loud in my car all the time!! Great guitar riffs, vocals, drums.....love it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Read all of the Jr books, this one is the first to keep me guessing until the end!  Will tell a friend.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|The title of my review in one word expresses my how fantastic,  awesome and bad ass this album is.  It's been an extremely long time since I've purchased an album that one first listen I'm in love love with. ......and I mean the entire album. I feel I was robbed buy how long it's been since we've heard Justin and reminded how good he is as an artist.  The transitions between each song.....dang effortless.<br /><br />Love love LoVE! ♥
B007REV4YI|5.0|I've collected every James Bond film ever made (and have watched them repeatedly) and I've also read all the Ian Fleming original literature.  I've studied the films, the literature and the history.  I believe I know this genre as few do.  I never thought that Sean Connery could be displaced as the definitive James Bond but Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet. Not only is his characterization masterful, his portrayal is enhanced by the technical skill employed in the Bond movies he's made.  Skyfall is the best yet.  There are several reasons why.  From a technical viewpoint the film is a masterpiece (with the slight imperfection of the wound in his shoulder mysteriously moving from one side to the other during the film), the supporting cast has evolved into significant characters in their own right (which serves to enhance Craig's characterization), and the depth of plot and personification moves the film to a higher level than any previously achieved.  For the first time, you begin to feel for James Bond as a person, as a real man who is both flawed and touchingly human.  I highly recommend this film for those who appreciate work of this type.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|This book was just ok - I kept waiting for something to happen, some kind of anything, nut just didn't get there for me.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|This is an old favorite, finally getting the DVD!  Outstanding features - the story, the action, and especially the musical score - be sure you have good stereo and surround sound, check out that opening - the music sizzles.  Fun to see Val Kilmer in this, one of his many good roles.  Of course Tom Curise and all the cast.  Really fun, sad sometimes, to watch.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Eventhough I saw Argo in the movie theaters and loved it.  Even watching it again at home was just as exciting and suspenseful.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Season 2 is a great season for Stargate Universe. Too bad it ended there.  The show is action filled and much improved over the first season.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Looking forward to watching season three and owning it. Would have been nice if the season 2 Blu-Ray set came with something like season 1 did with the dragon egg paper weight.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I honestly watched the entire season in one day. I'm totally hooked. This was the best purchase I've made in a long time.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Like the detail that is given. Nice interactive app for anyone who loves astronomy and that big rock above us :)
B004UJ81IA|4.0|I'm biased because my wife and I spent a wonderful holiday walking for 5 weeks in some of the same areas Stevenson travelled in.<br />It makes a great travel companion if your planning to travel in that area.<br />It had interesting flashbacks to the religous conflicts that happened in that area during the 17th century.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's the full game, I guess, but it's only one dollar. Geeze, are you for real? Yes! And it's only a dollar! Shut you're frumping mouth. No way Jose, I couldn't if I wanted to. This PvZ is a super sweet deal if you can grab hold of some WiFi and download this puppy you should.
B003FBMS4W|5.0|John Wayne, don't really need more words. I am a John Wayne fan I enjoy all Wayne movies and will say great
0316228532|5.0|Once I got past Barry Fairbrother's funeral, which literally seems to go on and on, the rest of the characters emerge, the story starts to show up on time and ready to work. This is not a feel good happy novel by any means, instead  it is quite dark as a cave with nary a light or canary. There are rough patches, but if the reader keepson, the story demands emotion and thought. There is a heaving downslope, no one remains unscathed, that compares to watching a flock of beautiful swans picked out of the air one by one. Complex, though not brilliantly written, expertly writ in regards to reality, futility and buckets of sadness; no small achievment by any standard.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|What can I say Tommy Lee does his usual great job.  The action was continuous the story great will look for more
B0045XICB2|5.0|I am not a movie watcher nor do I like Vampire movies so this was a total surprise to me.  I kept seeing advertisements, pictures, toys and all sorts of stuff for this movie but could never understand the draw to it, another Vampire movie big deal..So I asked my 22 year old son about it. He said it was a romance movie and not much on the blood and gore, that picked my curiosity. Lucky for me, a few days later they had Twilight, New Moon and Twilight eclipse on cable to advertise Breaking Dawn 2 to DVD. So I turned it on expecting to turn the channel with in a half hour, boy was I wrong!!!  I sat through the whole movie with my heart pounding, no vampire here.LOL... I found it to be a very addicting love story between a girl and her family, vampire and his family, werewolf and his family and how they all came together .  It felt a bit like Cinderella but she actually had two prince charming, one a vampire and the other a werewolf.. Both with a few wicked step sisters and brothers thrown in, to make it interesting... I really liked this movie and all the the rest of the twilight movie... Matter of fact after seeing New Moon and eclipse I ended up buying all five of the Twilight Movies....Beware! if you watch one they might get their bite on you and you might end up buying all five movie to get your fill of Twilight!!!!!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My son and I watched this together and we both really liked it. It was fun and well written. We will definitely be getting this one again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really love this app just in general but I have noticed that apps aren't equal across the board. This app, on my phone, totally flawed. But on the kindle, performs amazingly well.
B006YC74E8|4.0|It does what it is supposed to ..........There are other apps out there on Amazon that work equally well or better
B00A8ECU24|3.0|why in the world when I go to the shop I always want to get princess celestia and it is just a rip off and they want u to buy 100$ 4 1500 gems and maybe instead of making u buy 1500 gems turn them coin bits now that is a rip off if u ask me a rip off.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This has got to be the BEST photo app out there with so many editing choices. After I am finished with a photo the end product looks so professional
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I've been using this in the evening with my newborn who seems a little colicky. It's helped soothe her and lengthen her sleeping tome!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|So often you hear &#34;I couldn't put this book down.&#34;, well now I'm saying it and meaning it.  A terrific read!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am sorry I wasted a whole weekend reading such a depressing book. I know that 3% of the population are sociopaths and manipulating liars but I really don't need to spend my precious time getting into their demented minds. The book gives the message that one cannot survive knowing much less loving such a person.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|This is one of McEwan's quiet 'period' pieces, but for some reason I didn't enjoy it as much as his other novels. The main protagonist is a woman, and I never felt the writer got into her skin as much, in spite of references to clothes styles, hairdos, etc, The twist at the end is a surprise, but other than that, the book is a pleasant but uncompelling read.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|My wife and I have often times relied on this app to help soothe and put to sleep our &#60;1 year old daughter. The white noise app is great for drowning out disruptive noises as your baby sleeps and you do work around the house.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I really enjoyed this very clever look at MI5 spy intrigue in l973 England.  Don't look for blood or international intrigue here, but be drawn into intellectual espionage at the hands of a femme fatalle.  The characters are very interesting and engaging and the plot is so clever you gotta love it.  I wasn't scared for a minute though there is plenty of double-crossing,  risk-taking and surprises.  We all know Ian McEwan is a fine writer but I love that he can explore so many different subjects with such skill that you never can predict where he is going next.  This one piles layer upon layer of betrayal, snobbery, and lust, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  I wouldn't dream of revealing the plot because it's too complicated, and you'll just have to enter the labyrinth alone.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|very fun and challenging!  like how i can earn coins from completing levels and then spend them to unlock harder puzzles
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game has it all.  i love the thrill it gives me when i plwy the game. also they way u can use acorns to kill bugs qnd the fun it brings to my family.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love Facebook for being able to keep in contact with family who live far away in other states.  It has been great to catch up with them when some of them I haven't seen in years. The only thing that I don't like about Facebook is it's insistance on having to \\"improve\\" on how things are viewed.
B005C8ENI0|3.0|a lot of action, but nothing to write home about, something to pass some time on a rainy day at home.
B007XF4J70|5.0|This is by far the best looking classic movie I have ever seen. This happens to be my favorite movie of all time and I have seen this movie I would think over 30 times but seeing it on blu ray was like seeing it for the first time. Being a black and white Movie I noticed how crisp the blacks were and how they seemed to be another character in the movie. It was such a clear looking film with great depth on blu ray. The story alone with the amazing actors of Hollywoods Golden age makes this a MUST Blu Ray.
B00A31UXLW|3.0|Definitely not the best, but good enough to make me dodge some house duties! Fast-paced and well-packaged! Harry doesn't get older.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|have seen some reviews saying this doesn't look that good in blu ray and I am sorry but I have to disagree with that. This movie looked beautiful in blu ray. The crispness of the country side, the look of the rain and the story is wonderful. This is one of my favorite Eastwood movies and one of my top Westerns. On blu ray it was that much better, nothing beats Blu ray quality.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It is a great animation. My daughter really enjoyed it she laughed a lot through and request that I purchase it for her.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's a facebook app so if you want to check your FB this is an app that will allow you do do so.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|My kids have Temple Run on their tablet a love to play it all the time so when the Oz version came out I was happy to download it for them.  That was the last happy thing I had happen involving this game.  It somehow needs to stays connected and does this through the Amazon app installer but if you move to a week Wi-Fi spot the game crashes and takes down the app installer with it.  So every time the game goes down I have to uninstall it and the app installer then download and install both again in order to get it to work.  After doing this about 7 times I decided I had had enough and gave up on it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I just installed this game about seven weeks ago, and was semi-addicted to it, I must admit.  ********Please note, this game is nothing like the Oregon Trail you played as a kid, it's more like a FARMVILLE type of game.******** The game could get a little glitchy here and there, with the timing for crops to grow or buildings and houses to be ready to collect from, and to play this game very effectively, you really do need to spend your own REAL money to buy extra cash, energy, etc., but it was nothing that kept me from still playing the game or using my own money to buy cash every week (most weekends they run \\"deals\\" on their cash packages).  Until this week.  Everything crashed, there's a complete strange town on top of my town, I can't do anything, collect anything, craft anything, all the land I purchased is gone, the land my buildings are on shows it's not purchased, so I can't do anything with those buildings.  I'm stuck with a visiting town and screen on top of my regular town and can do nothing until it is fixed, IF IT IS EVER FIXED- that seems to be a whole different issue with this game and company.  If you look at the Gameloft forums, this is an issue MANY MANY people have gone through since November 2012 and Gameloft still can't seem to figure it out.  SO if you do get this free game, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do not waste your own REAL money for creating your town.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT AND A COMPLETE WASTE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was written so well and had me hooked from the beginning.  Every time I put the book down I couldn't help but think of the characters and what was going to happen next.  That's another thing, I didn't know what was coming next!  It's not good to figure out an entire book from the start and I enjoyed this story unfolding into all directions.  WOW!  I really loved 'Wool' and highly recommend it to be read.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This a wonderful movie. We had seen it on tv and wanted to see it again. This a movie you can watch with the family over and over again.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I don't usually watch Pixels from Disney but the plot to this was sweet, moral, and very thought-provoking.  I can't wait till my grandson get a little older to watch it with me.
B0018RC7QE|2.0|I am a great fan of Robert DeNero and Meryl Streep and looked forward to watching this movie.  The acting was on par with their usual performances, but the subject matter of the movie 'struck a nerve'.  It was  a personal matter and I decided that this movie was not for me and turned it off.  I was so disappointed not to be able to enjoy a movie with my favorite people starring in it.
B0041H18MM|5.0|Arvo Part seems to bring an otherworldly, breathtaking quality to choral and symphonic music. If you're unfamiliar with his work, this is a great place to start. I especially love the uncompromising rejection of Big Music: you aren't going to hear one blaring brass orchestral piece on this album, which is a fresh, freeing change for classical fans. He seems to understand the fact that quality is far more satisfying than quantity, and that skill far outstrips volume.<br />  You're going to notice that a few pieces appear more than once. (Fratres, Summa) Part's music is so multilayered that different presentations produce far different reactions, and it's fun to find a favorite. In my opinion, Summa for String Orchestra is the most beautiful rendition of it. Somehow, giving a choral work to a group of violins takes the music out of the church and into the pasture. Fratres for String Orchestra and Percussion is an incredible piece, telling a powerful, nebulous story in a gentle and careful way.<br />  Tabula Rasa is really its own world, and has an apt title: it reminds me of a tableau on top of a mountain, a soaring, alien musical landscape. The 'prepared piano' in it sounds profound and strange, like a completely different instrument. Dim the lights, and blast this one as loudly as you can.<br />  If you're looking for more, more is out there. The violins are played sweetly in this version of Tabula Rasa: a more uncompromising, stark version lies in Gidon Kremer's Silencio. The piano is emphasized a bit more, and the recording itself seems to highlight the extraordinary high notes from the violin. If you enjoy Tabula Rasa, I think that it is worth getting that version to understand how the piece can be played differently. Also, there exists an album called Fratres played by the Flanders Orchestra where the most interesting versions of Fratres can be found, in my opinion.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|interesting story and okay game play. needs option to disable timer. has freeze time bonuses but very rare and placed in impossible spots. I am on the last few levels and they are ridiculous. definitely need a way to shut off timer for those stuck levels
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green skilfully captures the adolescents' feelings in this story about young people who come of age while facing cancer.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is honestly one of the best series I've ever seen. You will definitely not regret watching it regardless of the type of shows you normally watch.
B000LJ9ZWE|4.0|There's a lot of set-up for the story.  It would be told differently these days & I'd love to see what they might be able to do w/ our current technology, but a very fun movie to watch.

1616550414|5.0|After pre-ordering the second it was available (I assumed it would sell out fast) I was shocked to see that not only did it not sell out before pre-order closed but the price dropped by almost half! I ended up getting this beauty for just under $20. I did what any other 37 year old Nintendo Fanboy would do and immediately ordered a second copy for me and one for my brother in-law.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on Christmas day as we were opening presents my Mother In-law had already gotten it for him. On the upside, I now have 3.<br /><br />The illustrations, concept art and lore are amazing and engrossing. I find myself lost in Hyrule many times while reading through this beauty.<br /><br />If you are a Zelda fan you NEED to own this now! For the money, you will never get something like this again!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Hands down the best driving game for the kindle I've come across. I have played a couple other free ones and they are good, but this is definitely the best. The controls are great, the sound effects are pretty amazing, and the music is pretty good too. Definitely worth a try.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It took me a few episodes of Season One to get all the characters straight, but once I did, I settled into the intricacies of this BBC drama/soap opera.  I now await Season 4, which is due to come out in the States next January.

B00BM1AJIO|3.0|i liked the game but it was really easy and didn't really like the fact that it was all little mini games unrelated to the main story. all in all the graphics where good but didn't feel real like some I've played. the HO scenes good i like that you don't get penalized for tapping to many times. ok game just to expensive.

B000PC0SPU|3.0|I liked this book. It presented a whole new way of thinking. The book has been planned and written very well, very systematically.<br /><br />The concepts are really good, and what I like, is that you can go into sections and chapters independently. This makes it great for reading later. I was pleasantly surprised to read about The Laughter Clubs. I have seen them in Bombay - yes, I refuse to call the city Mumbai - and I have always been bemused by them. Yet, the Zen Masters do say that humour and laughter can unlock the brain and can make it open to mystical union.<br /><br />The wealth of resources is fantastic, and allows one to go deeper into the subjects. To me, this is the greatest thing about the book.<br /><br />Equally, this is an easy read, and is a great way to get into the subject without strain or fuss. There is no obvious right-left brain bias!

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I didn't know what to expect; but I decided to watch it based on my admiration for Ang Lee. Immediately after viewing it, my reaction was that I really liked it; my husband said he wasn't sure. One thing is for certain - we were both riveted, as it held our interest completely. I found that I thought about the film all day the following day, and my husband said he did, too, and he's upgraded his rating to &#34;I really liked it&#34;, and I have upgraded mine to &#34;magnificent&#34;.  The visual effects are stunning; in HD it was just awesome.  A viewer's reaction will probably depend on his life philosophy - I thought it was surprisingly wonderful.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This mystery written by William Landay leans on the legal thriller side, though the air of mystery remains. The novel begins and includes throughout snippets from the protagonist, Andy Barber, during grand jury testimony. Therein lies, I found, the mystery of the novel. The testimony is clearly after the trial of Jacob Barber, Andy's teenage son, but what is it about?<br /><br />The overarching mystery is the murder of a teenage bully, whose body is found in a park. Andy is the ADA who leads the initial investigation--that is, until his sone is arrested for the murder. We then witness the Barber family's social isolation as they await Jacob's trial. Andy refuses to even contemplate Jacob's guilt, though Laurie Barber wrestles more with the possibility that Jacob is guilty. Underlying much of this is that Andy's ancestry includes a litany of violent fathers and that they possess the \\"murder gene.\\"<br /><br />This gene is, I think, too readily given plausibility by Laurie (who seems too smart to buy the idea), though it certainly drives Andy to reject it outright and embrace Jacob's innocence without a single question. I also thought the dialogue of the teenagers sounded dated (too many \\"likes\\" all over their dialogue). However, these are minor things in the larger scheme. The mysteries are well contained and the adult characters are memorable and well-defined.
B00632HWOG|5.0|able to use my kindle and check my email was awesome no heavy computer to go to just my hand held kindle
B005HS4CUY|5.0|Great Value! The movies itself,  their video & audio are all spectacular. If you are a fan of the series, don't look any further.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|loved the fact that I could watch part 1 and then go right to part 2 without getting up to put into a DVR but just press play.  Love my Kindle
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It has made me want to read more about World War One and Two.  About the League of Nations and  the United Nations and how they came about. I can not wait for the third book of this trilogy.  I also own these books in hardback and well as on my Kindle.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have tried several of the apps for Facebook and this one seems to work better then most. It is easy to figure out and to read for us older ones that are learning how to use the Kindle Fire.

B0031RS4V6|5.0|Couldn't put it down. This is the second Jack Reacher I have read and both have been fantastic. The books do not need to be read in order of publication to be enjoyed.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|This movie is a superb dramatization of the success of Facebook leading to its IPO.  It is a great movie, entertaining based on a very well written script.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Once you get it flowing the challenge is a lot of fun. Every level builds expectation to make it to the next.
157330087X|5.0|I am a big fan of SRV,Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raite, Dr. John....and the others so this is an awesome watch. Jimmy Vaughn hosts this tribute to his brother. The grand finale when Jimmy riff's then points his guitar at someone and they take off is my favorite part of course, but I have watched this over and over.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|fun game with good graphics but I have gotten back on three times now after having to stop and the game has failed to save myprogress three times.
B001ROZIA0|5.0|The cast is a powerhouse and it pays off. Christopher Plummer is a delight. I have loved Stockard Canning since the mid seventies and this part just deepened my love. I am biased because I am a very big fan of Cusack and Lane and beens so for years.  Just some excellent scenes, nice flow, some realistic shenanigans.  Very fun a bit touching and well acted
B00BESM14U|5.0|This is not a warm and fuzzy movie. I enjoyed the story because it was moving and real; a lot of great acting.
0783219733|5.0|great for the grandmother and the grandkids.  we love watching it together. thanks. am glad i have added it to my collection!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game love playing with my horse totally worth it I have a zebra and love horses next stop unicorn
B008LD4126|5.0|This is the first album of Elbow's that I've owned. I simply love it. It took several listens to get all the nuances and to catch all the masterful lyrics, but I think that's the mark of great music: it takes some digestion, like a great meal. The instrumentation on the songs is unique and atmospheric, and Garvey's voice is whiskey glass. I love Long War Shuffle and Macgreggor but also Buffalo Ghosts and.well, all the songs, depending on the mood I'm in.  I learned about this band because I saw that Benedict Cumberbatch (my hands-down favorite actor) goes to their concerts, so I checked them out. I am not at all disappointed.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Saving the dollar per movie over on demand...NOT worth the frustrating experience. Can't tell you one time my purchase wasn't interrupted. Netflix = reliable
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|By practicing these four agreements, you really can see positive changes in your life.  The first three agreements deal with how you think and process information from others.  The fourth agreement deals with how you perform in your life.  The author states that as you begin to apply these agreements, positive, almost magical, things begin to happen in your life.  It's true.  Just by changing your self-talk, your words to others, and how you process words and actions from others, you really can live without the negative results from doing otherwise.  I recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with negativity in their lives.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|We love horror movies series does not dissappoint the viewer.  Like the character development.  Thrills and chills.  A little gory sometimes.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like this product because it make it easier to find information that you need. It is a good product.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Has good scripting and casting.  Keeps you interested with some character flaws and acting is great.  Never boring and good suspense.
B007D1HVW4|5.0|Lost a few pounds laughing with this one. Had to watch it several times to catch all the great moments.
B006K1IIAC|5.0|Plenty of DVD players in the US have codes which will make them region-free and therefore able to play DVDs from around the world. From personal experience, I just had to enter a sequence of numbers on the remote and it worked instantly. Super easy. I'd recommend doing your research first: figure out if your DVD player has codes to become region-free. If not, consider buying a DVD player that can. You can also switch the region on you computer, but only a limited number of times before it gets stuck. Maybe there's a way around that as well, but I've never tried.<br /><br />Okay, my review on Sherlock: Ridiculously good. I was hesitant when I learned it was a modern adaptation, but it's done flawlessly. The writing, acting, and cinematography are fantastic. My only problem with the series as a whole is the episode count and the almost two-year wait in between new seasons. On the other hand, only having six, 90-minute episodes means you can jump in very quickly without having to catch up on hours upon hours of material. Overall: A+++
0394806220|5.0|This is one of my 7 month old's favorite books.  The noises that are in the book just make him laugh and laugh.  I wasn't familiar with this Dr. Seuss but very glad that we stumbled upon it.  Highly recommended!
B001EQ5ZJK|3.0|Dr. Lipton provides a lot of fascinating science, but I felt the book could have included examples of how his discovery transformed his life.  He glosses over the things he did and the way he did them to improve his life.  It's not really clear in what ways his life did improve.  It did inspire me to learn more about his theories, and I'm grateful for that.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|My 6yr old son likes to play this game.  He likes to see how big his shark can get.  Keeps him occupied for a long time.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|What a fast-paced, interesting read! It has given me clarity on my cluttered life or rather my perception of it. I was very close to chucking all my different hobbies and only focusing on one. Now I realise its ok to do many things a litle at a time and in so doing, building up a body of work. I'll still be getting rid of my &#34;time-wasters&#34; but keeping the hobbies, art projects, work in progress and all the things that get my creative juices flowing. There are so may ideas in this book I loved that I will have to read the book many times to remind myself. This time around it will be finding my heroes and building my creative family tree.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Not only does my son play this but so does my husband.  Funny to see all the birds dressed like the star wars characters.
0345472322|5.0|The book has helped me to understand how different mindsets, fixed or growth, impact a person's life: a person's ability to function and level of success.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I don't think this movie was as good as the Bourne trilogy at all but it was an entertaining show that kept my interest throughout. The ties to the original 3 movies was poorly done and not really needed for this movie. I will be interested if a sequel is made how it will play out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gruesome - and awesome!  I really like this show - everyone should watch this show - i am trying to use my 16 words
B005LAIHSG|4.0|an interesting distortion of the snow white story with reasonable action and good special effects. story keeps you watching throughout with enough variation to keep you guessing where it is going without predicting the whole plot part way through.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVED IT!  Nicholas Sparks does not leave the reader disappointed.  He is a master of story telling and I have read every one of his books!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put all three books down! I loved all of them and have recommended them to my friends! Definitely a must read!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Kept attention without the need for Gore. Had the hair on the back of my neck rising. A great movie!
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Got what I paid for.  I expected a bit more help notes but the basics are there, not much else to say.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game!! I would like move coins to be avavilable. I like way the places you visit continually switches from one city to another!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I won't carry on like other reviews...I'll keep this review short...I'd been looking at this watch for some time...I finally bought this and was a great deal.  Simple and sleek, it can be worn anytime....accuracy is what you'd expect minimal adjusting...love this watch not much else to say...
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game!!! It did become to hard for me and the missions seemed almost impossible. I had it about a month and uninstalled it. I might go back to it again and start over someday!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have it loaded on kindle fire and my android phone. And the ads usually go away after a few games.
0765325950|3.0|Robert Jordan left so many characters and divergent subplots that it must have been enormously difficult to take over an epic adventure of this scope but Brandon Sanderson did a great job considering the complexity he had to work with.  The previous two WoT books by Sanderson leading to the finale revitalized the series and the last book was a solid effort.<br /><br />The descriptions of the many, many military maneuverings would have been better spent developing the beloved characters that we've had a love hate affair with for the past 13 years.  Similarly as much as I enjoyed some of the new characters introduced (Androl!), I would have preferred to have spent more time with the people I've followed for 14 books (Thom, Fain). Mat and Perrin's roles in the Last Battle were well earned and rousing, and I liked where Min ended up.  Rand was never a favorite but I'm content with the way he played out (though the Last Battle between Rand and Shaitan was weak). My biggest complaint was that there felt like no real RISKS were taken, no twist left me gasping (or cheering).<br /><br />I felt satisfied with the conclusion of the Wheel of Time.  Did I love the final book as much as the first?  Nah.  But the characters and fantastical world building which brought me back again and again (and again) will always have a special place on my bookshelf.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is a light, sophisticated comedy geared towards baby boomers. It's uplifting and upscale. A pleasant escape movie with a good story line and featuring two great actors.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|How quick can you get to your app and look around for what you want!! Get it you will absolutely like it!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are great and it's fairly easy to earn money, although I wish there were other options to raise energy, maybe from visiting neighbors or one of the mini games. Overall, I really enjoy playing.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Love this app. great graphics and sound. wish there was a bigger selection of free songs but it was great all the same
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My family saw this movie and came back with praises so o decided to read it first..couldn't put it down
B00BW5K5DO|1.0|I liked the game I bought at a reduced rate, but it only let me get up to a certain level and then wouldn't let me continue.
0321543726|5.0|I purchased this book some time back after purchasing many other books that purported to teach C++. Having been a FORTRAN dinosaur, I have some knowledge of program structures and wanted ultimately to learn and understand the low level assembly-like language capabilities of C++, enough so I wouldn't screw up an operating system-a noble and lofty goal. Couldn't make much of the other books. I had Visual Studio installed-simplest programs would not run and when they did the console window would disappear-Where did it go?! After reading some reviews, took a chance on this book. Dr.Stroustrup takes pains not to threaten the reader and puts him/her at ease. My Visual Studio problem wasn't my stupidity-it's a quirk in Visual Studio as explained in Appendix C. You have to enter statements before the return 0 statement in your main block that \\"fools\\" the computer into waiting for more info to be entered thus leaving the console window open-you see the program results. I use char key=0; and cin >> key; just before the return. Appendix C is the best intro to using Visual Studio out there! You will learn programming from this book and will get a foundation in the C++ language enough to know where to go next. Yeah the calculator problem as mentioned by other reviewers is a stinker but by the time you get there you find, at least in my case, those other books start becoming comprehensible-that's a lot for barely a sixth of the way into the book. Other reviewers describe how Dr.S. uses the FLTK graphics API to demonstrate classes- on your way to game programming! I bought his C++ Programming Language Special Edition after this to continue with OOP and D'Orazio's book for physical science/engineering program examples. Some choose to bundle this book with Koenig/Moo-another good choice. C++ not so scary now-well on the way to becoming dangerous or less so. Great book to give you the push.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game was exciting and fun. Reminded me of old times when I was a kid.  Great job bringing it all back.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|I really enjoyed this documentary. it was informative, I learned a lot about Bob Marley that I didn´t  know  and the music  was  great...
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Entertaining. Addictive. Fast. Especially when playing with my son. We both want to be the fastest ... so bad ...
B007N6NGYG|4.0|I liked this game a lot. It was fun to play with quite a few levels to keep you occupied. I'm not sure about not reloading skips, like some reviews have said, but I haven't used any of mine. The rules were simple and easy to understand. The only one I couldn't get was the money bank, all that the rule said was that you need a certain amount of coins to beat the level. I finally figured that you had to click on the train a couple of times so it slowed to a stop at the bank.<br /><br />I use a kindle fire and didn't see any issues using this app. The only issue was downloading the game, since it was such a large file and took a long time to download. And with my poor internet connection, I actually had to try downloading it several times before it finally took.<br /><br />The graphics are nice and the cows were cute. The sounds were nice as well and I liked the train crash noise.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fun game to play that got harder as the levels continued. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes train and puzzle games.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Watching the movie has to be done without ever, and I mean ever, comparing it to the musical. They are two totally different versions of a story written a long time ago. The movie is a word sung movie. There is no &#34;regular talking&#34;. The imagery is harsh. The feelings raw. Do you hear the people sing .... singing the song of angry men .... It is the story of a people who will not be slaves again .... There is a lot of despair, anger, but also love and even beauty .... A definite to be seen.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I have a kindle fire, and I saw that some people had issues using this game on fire, but it seems like the problems have been fixed. I have no issue using the controls.<br /><br />At first, I thought this game was entirely too easy, but as the levels continued, the game got harder. I liked the UFO in the game as well. The music was classical and fit the game very well. The graphics are cute and well done. I did feel sorry for the ducks though. There are a ton of different planes you can play, after you unlock them of course. The bonuses in the game were very helpful as the levels progressed, and there seemed to be just the right amount of them (not too much, not too little). I liked that the screen had arrows pointing out the enemies, making it a bit easier to find the last stray enemy.<br /><br />The controls were simple to use and there wasn't anything complicated about this game. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a new, fun game to play. I got this when it was free, but I think it's still worth the money for everything you can do in this game.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Good show. Remembering .... It was around when there was not much else on the tube ... at least not in Europe .... Very British !
B008K8VDPU|2.0|Did not like this at all. But maybe someone who knows how to play would. so I give it just two stars.
B00AQK4EWY|5.0|One of the first classics I read as a kid. Victor Hugo wrote an absolute tremendous story. Sad, Happy, Terrible, Cruel ... it has all of the ingredients to keep you hooked .... I like the French version best. Because it always seems to be a better read for me when I can read a book in the original language. But, there are many excellent translations on the market .... Do not let language barriers get the better of you :D
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely, breathtakingly, BEAUTIFUL from start to finish I found myself completely wrapped up in the entire story, from the heart soaring to the heartbreak love it was an amazing read
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It took me a long time to start a twitter account. I did not want to be swamped with tweets all day long.

Tweeting keeps things short and to the point ....

055321263X|5.0|Way back in 1860 Wilkie Collins wrote what most consider to be the first mystery novel, and it is also one of the best ever, providing an example which has been much copied but seldom matched. We have a mysterious woman dressed all in white who has apparently escaped from an insane asylum; a member of the British aristocracy with a secret that he will go to any lengths to keep; a beautiful young woman who is in peril; an intelligent young woman who is devoted to protecting the damsel in distress; a courageous man who loves the beautiful maiden; an eccentric uncle who provides some comic relief; and one of the best super-villains ever, who is interestingly portrayed as a study in contrasts.<br /><br />The plot is intricate in the extreme and quite suspenseful. Collins originally published this in installments in a magazine, so periodically we have cliff hangers, much as in television serials today. Many skillful misdirections are included (today known as \\"red herrings\\") which lead readers to the wrong conclusions. In the end, it is all quite logical and all the mysteries are explained.<br /><br />Many of the characters rival those of Charles Dickens in their believability and memorability, particularly the intelligent young woman (half-sister of the damsel in distress) and the villain.<br /><br />The structure of the novel is interesting and clever, being accounts or diaries written by various of the characters. This allows to Collins to advance the story while revealing aspects of the characters' personalities through their own words.<br /><br />All in all, I would say this is one of the best mysteries I have ever read. It is like combining Charles Dickens (who influenced Collins) with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (who was influenced by Collins).<br /><br />Recommended for those who like mystery stories and who appreciate Victorian literature.<br /><br />This section is kind of a postscript to my review. To my more modern mind, the beautiful maiden in the story is insipid, child-like, and not very intelligent. She can't seem to withstand any psychic stress at all, falling into insensibility at the slightest hint of trouble. The half-sister is portrayed as being intelligent, courageous, resourceful, and ugly. And who does the hero choose as his true love? Interestingly enough, the villain of the piece apparently falls for the ugly sister.<br /><br />Somehow, it seems to me that Collins may have secretly shared my opinions about the relative value of the two sisters, while adhering to more popular expectations in his plot line. If I were a Ph.D. student, I would research a dissertation on this aspect.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|My husband's mother experienced a near death situation, so we know this book reports this kind of experience truthfully. I can easily recommend this book.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The cooler received a pretty good review at SPCR ([...]), and it is one of the cheapest silent options you have, so I got it. SPCR also noted that the stock fan gives off a weird, whiny noise, and yes, it does! Since the rest of my PC is pretty silent, that noise was fairly annoying so I shelled out another $16 and swapped the stock fan for a Nexus Real Silent fan, and now it is quiet.  As for the cooling, I never am even getting close 115F, which means that it does the job for my setup and CPU load perfectly. For more detailed measurements I'd recommend the SPCR review.  If you're looking for a quiet solution, you should weigh between getting this one here for cheap(er) and (probably) having to invest in a better fan, or just getting one of the more expensive, but probably out-of-the-box quiet ones from Noctua or so.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is a great app for taking care of a virtual horse it doe  everything you might normally do to take care of a real horse....I love it!
B0067R0APK|4.0|Switched from free to paid app to get rid of ads, like the new look and info at a glance. JUST hope AccuWeather adds a control to adjust transparency of radar images so you can see under laying cities and towns in storms paths, also control to slow down or speed up radar images, not just time frame settings.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it love it love it!  The subtleties in the relationships and the Dowagers facial expressions adds such interest to the already interesting story line.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Well-acted, great sets, but extraordinarily dull. I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings movies (the extended versions)and have watched them multiple times. But there just isn't enough material to turn one relatively short book into three long movies. I won't watch this a second time.
B0076DELIG|3.0|wondering if Michael Connelly is running out of themes. This books story dragged in many places. Still enjoy his use of  English and his sense of humour
B006LSZECO|3.0|Crazy story! Keeps you reading but totally crazy and believable at the same time. All I have to say is wow!
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|It's painful watching Kristen Stewart attempting to play a sweet, loving character. She can't manage to keep her trademark sneer away and just basically always looks bored and pissed off. Which is also how I felt watching the movie. No matter how many times the characters proclaimed that she was the most wonderful person in all the land, I saw no trace of this in Stewart's performance. So much for show, don't tell.<br /><br />The movie is boring, disjointed, shallow, and felt like it went on forever, as the dialogue was terrible. No doubt it was beautiful between the cinematography and the cg, but it wasn't enough to make up for the horrible plot, script and lackluster performances.
B00BHMF578|2.0|A great idea for a movie, but difficult to execute.  All the &#34;action&#34; takes place largely indoors through dialogue, scary and fearful dialogue.  The screenplay has to be well written, as, say, &#34;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&#34; This one is not well-written.  John Houseman and Alan Arkin mail in their nearly irrelevant cameo performances.  And Ben Affleck does what handsome male leads are expected to do--appear strong, confident, yet sensitive, and courageous.  How can the Iranians not be foiled and the Americans rescued with such a hero within their borders?  Don't waste your time and money.
B0047VLFS4|3.0|Very well done historical movies with great performances all round, specially from Rachel Weisz. But the film moved more slowly that I would have liked and at time I found myself waiting for something to happen. I'm glad I saw it but once was enough.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I enjoy watching Downton Abbey together. Season two has many twist and turns and develops the characters to a new depth.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I can remember when I was child watching and enjoying Tintin cartoons on television in England. This is much more sophisticated, similar to an Indiana Jones movie but with the Tintin characters and I'm sure it will appeal to all the family. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to young and old alike.
B005K17RU0|5.0|awesome . easy to use.  a must have application.  very explicit and precisely the info you, perhaps the information needed just before leaving for vacations.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book changed the way I think.  It is well written for all faiths.  Try it, it might change things for you as well
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This was one the best bond movies I have seen. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.
B007MJSNS8|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, and when I saw that this was another Julian Fellowes project, my curiosity was piqued. It also stars Maggie Smith, Hugh Bonneville and Allen Leech (Branson) from DA. I won't go into story details, other reviewers have that covered. It was an impulse purchase that I'm very glad I made. This, like my other review for Ellory Queen Mysteries, hearkens back to a simpler time and is comfort food viewing. I highly recommend this film. Do yourself a favor and buy it, rent it, just watch it. You'll be glad you did.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Fruit Ninja is so much fun, and super addicting! You have to slice the fruit without hitting bombs. I got this for free, but I would pay for it if I had to :)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Joss Whedon since Buffy The Vampire Slayer. He really is amazing with dialogue, and always draws out the best performances. I'm a big superhero movie fan, own most of them. Purchasing this movie was a no brainer. Love Love Love this film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|...except the ads in the free version. Angry birds is crazy addicting. Shooting little birds across the screen and knocking down rocks and walls. My son, daughter, husband, parents... everyone I know loves this game.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my kids love angry bird products and so this has been a great game. Anything  that keeps them busy and quite is great for us.
B008J34466|5.0|yet another great album from Pink and look forward to more in the future:)  a must for all fans or new fans:)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's simple but fun.(and addictive) It is for people that need a game to play for a couple of minutes.
630463949X|3.0|Fleetwood Mac, one of my favorite bands, however, this DVD doesn't have any audio on it. It seem to be a copy of a copy of copy. I have a very nice system, a Yamaha receiver and Definitve Techology speakers. I was very disappointed with this DVD, not the band or their music ,the audio.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really good game really enjoyed playing it, but the only problem with it is it is addictive. I can play on it for hours and that is just because it is really good. But on it there are a couple of boosts that I didn't really understand the point of, like the jumping shoes and the unlock unlocking the girl for me was nearly impossible but that doesn't really bother me to be honest. But I would would recommend this game to any age really, my Mum enjoyed playing it but I git really annoyed because I couldn't do it. But over all I loved it.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The Kindle Fire case met all of my expectations. It does everything that the ad claimed. I would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very very fun game to play and is very addicting.the cool part is that you can try to beat your friends scores
B00A92MDH2|5.0|It has it all, great music ,wit,humour, interestlngly  performed. Well written tunes with very hip  lyrics. The players are all vituosos.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Highly consider it.<br />An amazing, beautiful, and spectacular read.<br />It will complete you in a matter you cannot fully describe.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not up to the earlier Scarpetta novels. Ms. Cornwell is not taking the time to write in the depth of character that she used too. Not the story that I expected...LisaC
B000HKYA1I|5.0|Only seen a bit of this movie, and it was seriously intriguing. extremely interesting. HOLY CRAP ELIJAH WOOD'S EYES ARE SO FREAKING GIGANTIC AND BLUE! Not the best hairstyle on him though. :p Anyway, Elijah is an amazing actor as always, and Eugene is very good as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very interresting. at first I didn't know about if it was a good choice but it really is. I reccomend it.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The storyis kind of lame but the graphics r good and the items are difficult enoughto find without being impossible. I am enjoying this so far. Got it free but probably would have gladly paid a buck or two for it. Ifyoulike hidden object games, I would recommend this one.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I would recommend this book for all intro and extroverts.  Wake up you extroverts, Quiet does not equal dumb!  There's a lot going on in those heads!
B009KEN87O|5.0|What fond memories of days dating my husband!  Space Invaders and Pac Man! Voxel Invaders gives the extra fun of being able to move one's spaceship in any direction...not just horizontally.  Love the game!
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I remember watching the Jungle Book movies on TV when I was a child.  Fun to reacquaint with the stories again.  Easier to understand as an adult!
B000007638|5.0|I have the Japanese version of this, and paid a lot for it.  Maybe it is better than the old domestic version, but the sound quality is truly horrible nonetheless, despite the claim of remastering.  If you listen on a computer or inexpensive stereo system, then this version is fine.  But if you have anything approaching audiophile quality equipment, you will be surely disappointed with any previous version of WOA.  I have simply been unable to listen to it, period.<br /><br />So I discovered today that this is finally going to re-issued by Paul himself, so I can't wait to finally hear what I hope is a great remastering.  Seriously, no one should be buying one of these older CD versions for more than $5, and please ignore all the 5 star reviews if you really want a quality sound experience.<br /><br />Update: Just found a link to the 2013 version on amazon in advance of the release.  Standard and deluxe versions:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Wings-Over-America-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00C8985DU<br />http://www.amazon.com/Wings-Over-America-Standard-Edition/dp/B00C7NKPPS/ref=pd_sim_m_2<br /><br />The 5 star review reflects the music on the album, not the sound quality of these old CD releases, which gets a 1 star review.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|if you are looking for something simple, actionable & focused, this is a great book!! The chapters are in logical sequence & the examples help demonstrate the theory.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Everything you need in one app. Like the word display,different. like the weather display also. great alarm clock too. So far no issues
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Life changing if you look at it as a motivational book. Entertaining if you look at it as a novel. One of those books that conveys powerful concepts in such simple language & technique that leaves you mesmerised and inspired at the same time.
B001H4NXCK|4.0|Great cast, fun adventure, lot of humor throughout.  Not a huge fan of westerns, but this is well worth watching.
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|Up until 'Lost Highway' Bon Jovi was my second favorite band of all-time, in fact 'These Days' was the first album I ever bought and it's still my favorite all-time album, from any artist. But something started to change with this band around the time they released that money-grab package known as '100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong' and it came to fruition with that God-awful 'Lost Highway'. To say this band is no longer hungry would be letting them off the hook far too easily. Lots of band's, in fact 99.9% of them lose their edge but that doesn't make them sell-out and make no mistake Bon Jovi officially and unapologetically sold-out with 'This Left Feels Right' & 'Lost Highway. They, or should I say he, of course tried to right the ship with 'The Circle' but that seemed forced and insincere. Fans are smarter then that.<br /><br />Bon Jovi hit their musical peek with 'These Days' and for the most part every subsequent album has been noticeably worse then the last, the sole exception being this one, barely. 'Crush' was a good album made better by the fact that it was the first Bon Jovi album in five years. 'Bounce' & 'Have a Nice Day' where so-so at best and mediocre at worst. Which leads me to this album. I will say it's better then 'The Circle' but that's only because I was able to make it through more of this album. It has highly polished and produced songs three of which will get airplay and the rest consisting of filler, other then that the best thing about this album is the fact that Tico's drums are more prominent in the mix then ever before.<br /><br />I've grew up listing to Bon Jovi's working-class anthems believing every word Jon sang as if it were a guide to life. But now that I'm all grown up and I understand why bands release \\"greatest hits\\" and other \\"compilation\\" type albums,it's free money. I also understand why there are only 2-3 good songs on albums now-a-days and the rest are just \\"fillers\\" -- what make more financial sense - releasing andtouring on one album with 10 good songs or releasing and touring on three albums with 3 good songs?<br />15 years ago when I was a kid and listened to Jon Bon Jovi sing \\"you live for the fight, when it's all that you got\\" it fed my soul. Now when I here him sing lines of hope I can't help saying to myself \\"dude, I watched an interview in which you said you modeled your house after the palace of Versailles. To me he's become pretentious and is just pandering to what people want to hear and not what he's really thinking. I've read and watched lots of interviews with him over the years and sad to say it's all about image and money for him, sure he does a lot for charity and he makes darn sure the world hears about it. If he was doing it out the kindness of his heart then why seek press on it? As further proof, aside from the aforementioned compilation and \\"country\\" albums, is the fact that Richie Sambora went to rehab mid tour and they continued the tour without him - just replaced one of the greatest guitarist and main reason the band is successful... Why do that if not only for the fear of losing money?<br /><br />Wake up people, Jon Bon Jovi is all about himself...and money, of course! But the other three guys are awesome. If you want to see where the true heart of Bon Jovi lies then I suggest you listen to Richie Sambora's solo album 'Undiscovered Soul.' Awesome album and further proof that Sambora is the heart of Bon Jovi while Jon is nothing more then an arrogant hood ornament.
B004H6G0TI|1.0|I downloaded and installed/uninstalled  twice. Reported size installed was much smaller than the 20MB the app was supposed to be. Initialized but no buttons worked-  wouldn't start.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Wanted to read it because the movie should be coming out soon, but was really surprised how much I enjoyed it. Didn't expect a lot of the twists this story had. Would definitely recommend this.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Yea we all get old but not Bond.<br /><br />But still good movie, just not a good Bond Movie.<br /><br />Will not watch again.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a good original game with great graphics, sound, and variation. My kids will like it too...I like that they built in multiple profiles so we can keep our progress separate.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Season 8 started off slow, but since episode 12 'As Time Goes By', I can't stop watching them over and over.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I don't usually read fantasy but just loved this book and the idea of the imagination that created this world.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me interested through the end.  The building of the characters help to understand the situation.  The complications of mental illness and how it can effect everyones life.  What we except because of who we are and the environment we experienced Read this book because it shows the complexity of each and everyone we have relationship with.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Movie is great. Amazon service is terrible. After paying to rent, movie would only play 15 seconds and then quit. Had to rent elsewhere.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie very much, had a good story line, and the ending was well done.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Light read. Typical Nicholas sparks book. The ending did have an interesting twist that I wasn't expecting. This would be a quick beach read!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Loved all of the old video game references, plus our kids really enjoyed the movie.  Good story along with excellent casting.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|Awesome Item, good price, I couldn't be happier with the purchase I did and its price, btw its condition too :D
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Found the story line tighter than the original, very creative with the combining of two characters into one.  Ending was a little weak which is why I gave it a three star.
B00AEFY552|5.0|Awesome Item, good price, I couldn't be happier with the purchase I did and its price, btw its condition too :D
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it gave me a new way to look at my life.  Having had breast cancer recently,<br />I understand Albom's statement that we are put on this earth for a fixed number of days.  This way we<br />can appreciate each and every day we exist.  I don't know how long I will be here, but I want to live my<br />final days to the fullest.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Every time I try to add music to it no playlists come up to add! What a waste of a 1$!
B001MSMULG|4.0|What a great novel. Totally compelling and completely believable scenarios! Absolutely loved it! I just found myself a new author to read and will read all of his great books!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Great trilogy. Good ending. Recommend to all for a lighthearted read. Great book to unwind with after a long day of work.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|Great book, very different from the usual books I read.  It keeps you gripped right till the end. Highly recommended.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The Life of Pi is a fable-like story that has been brought to the screen by an astounding director. The visuals of this film were worth the purchase price. The story requires the ability to suspend belief and let the viewer's mind open itself to the experience in order to enjoy the film and receive the full impact. If you are a person who views a film with the sole purpose of picking it apart, you'll be disappointed because you missed the story.<br /><br />I recommend this film for all ages.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The images were incredible, beautiful in fact.  The story was smart and engaging.  A A great edition to the Christmas genre.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This film in a wonderful way to spend an evening and while children may not appreciate the nuances the adult writers inserted into this film.<br />Sarah SIlverman as the character voice of Princess Venelope - a main character - was annoying because she doesn't sound like a child, she sounds like Silverman trying to sound childish. It is probably the only sticking point in an otherwise wonderful movie filled with visual displays that deliberatly shift to show the many progressive technology steps computer games have gone through over time.<br />I went away from this film with a smile on my face which shows that even an adult can enjoy this movie without having to bring the kids.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Think about how our liberal attitudes are used by the enemy<br /> to take advantage  of our guys in harm's way.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Charlize Theron.<br /><br />So mortifiyingly fabulous.<br /><br />Were there any other characters?<br /><br />Ok there were other characters. But what I loved about this movie was Charlize Theron, could you tell? And the darkness of it. She was the shining star, resplendent in her evilness. Perhaps it was cinematography, or art direction, or props, or MS Theron herself. Delicious. There is a scene, with a bird, and a metal device and MS Theron. Nuff said. So tasty.<br /><br />The movie itself is actually a very nice adaptation of Snow White. It is well thought, well presented, and entertaining. Art direction and cinematography (and CGI of course) is excellent. And the main actors did a fairly good job of portraying their roles. Snow White was brave, though, I would have preferred a little more character time with her to develop empathy, which was lacking. The Joan of Arc warrior type portrayal of SW is a twist, but, not one I like particularly, since it does not jibe with the original fairy tale and Germano/Celtic legends. Part of the reason I did not develop empathy is due to the short screen time with her, though SW's portrayal is also rather flat. The huntsman was also a nice touch because he is often omitted from SW films, though prominent in some of the stories. I had much stronger empathy for the huntsman. I was distracted on a couple of occasions by accents, which were inconsistent. On the one hand, if the actors had spoken in their native accents all the time, or if the actors all used some particular accent, it would not have been distracting.<br /><br />On the whole though, my enjoyment factor was high, especially because of the detail in development of the darkness.<br /><br />It would be nice to see perhaps 20-25 more minutes squeezed in to develop Snow White herself, and perhaps her rapport with the huntsman. Don't let this deter you from renting/buying this film though. If you like authentic and historical versions of fairy tales, the feeling of old Celtic and old Germanic fairy tales/myths is very rich in this file. Perhaps why I loved it.<br /><br />Or Charlize.
B00BHU261S|4.0|A well made and enjoyable movie with excellent actors.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ordering through amazon was easier through directv and playback was excellent.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Most of the story was very predictable. Very little imagination and hardy any background research required. No where nearly as good as Grisham's earlier works.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read...how does he keep doing it? This story is very well told and I found it hard to put the book down.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I saw it twice in the theater and now own the 3D Blu-Ray disc. I love this movie. I think the scenes at sea are just breathtaking and deserved the Oscar for cinematography. The 3D effects are terrific on the TV screen as this is a beautiful disc. Congrats to Ang Lee.
0425263916|5.0|I feel in love with 1st book and I'm almost done with the second and cannot wait for the third one to come. Awesome series so far!
1932735410|5.0|My employer, an airplane company, uses it as the study material in our PMP prep classes. (This is not a direct endorsement from the unnamed airplane company).  Well organized and a proven source to pass the test. Sure, our study group adds additional knowledge from the instructors that have already passed the test, but the book is the core source of study.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app as you can add to it on your phone, work computer, home computer and it attaches to all your devices.  I love it and recommend highly for anyone that likes one product to do many things.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|French films are general more art than the their comparable Hollywood slop.The French love of film making is always obvious even in a crowd pleasing film like this one. The film is  quite enjoyable with compelling dialogue,a witty well written screen play, great acting and and some beautiful cinematography. The  scenes filmed in the millionaires house during the bright sunlight day are a testament to this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl kept my attention through all the twists and turns. A great read....but the ending is awful. I feel cheated.
B000025RHI|4.0|The primary attraction of this very old CD is Lee &#34;Scratch&#34; Perry's production. The Congos are soulful singers around which Perry creates a relatively sensuous soundscape. The lyrics, however, are hardly profound and don't rise up to level of Bob Marley, etc. And while the production is quite creative, the sound quality is relatively poor, likely the result of massive overdubbings. That said, if you want a nice cheerful reggae album to play on a Sunday morning, you won't do much better.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Joe Bonammassa is one of the best blues guitar players I've ever heard.<br />I'm collecting ALL his CD's and videos.  This set had a bad DVD in the package<br />that wouldn't play so the Seller gave me a refund.  So I give him 5 stars for that.<br />Thanks!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This documentary was very well done. The story of Rodriguez is fascinating. His music is also quite telling and I am glad I am now aware that he is out there.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was some what similar to 50 shades but eva was more brazen then Anastasia.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We had never seen Downton Abbey before and a friend recommended the series to us. We borrowed season 1 on DVD and, when we were done, my wife watched these as quickly as possible!! Highest quality entertainment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite book of the trilogy. It has just the right amount of action, continued character development, & the exploration of the love felt between Peeta and Katniss is just right. This was my 5th time reading this book in less than a year and I know that I'll be reading it again.
B000SW2F8K|3.0|Funny movie. Nothing speculator with the acting. Something to watch that doesn't require much brain power. Penelope Cruz is beautiful and sexy therefore making this movie any guys dream.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|I love it when a plan comes together!! !!! What do you mean I need twelve more words?? It's MY review
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great movie. Better on the big screen but a great DVD to watch over and over again. The extras are interesting too.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Cheesy title above, I know, I know.. but this season was craaazzzy! Do yourself a favor and just watch it. Nuff said.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This book got me hooked from the beginning and I finished in a few days. There were a couple of &#34;huh?&#34; moments towards the end, but they were easy to overlook.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I LOVE this game! I have completed this game already, but whenever you restart it, it's just like you haven't played it before!
B00AFAHUXU|5.0|Great app, looking for something like this for long, this will definitely become my must have app. Thank you!<br />The layout is simple but great.
B008Y73940|5.0|I liked the movie even better than the book.  Michael McConaughey was believable and gave the character real presence. A very enjoyable film.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This book read like Anthony was standing in front of me telling the story of how he got his big break.  He is so fascinating in his delivery of things and in general definitely a page turner.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I have been waiting for the full soundtrack to come out since we saw the movie. Glad I waited for the full thing. We listen to this at least once a day. Awesome cast, and awesome music.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Highly addictive, challenging and pretty funny. Sometimes the game has some random difficulty spikes but other than that it's a good  game
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a very entertaining HOG. The puzzles are challenging but overly so. I also enjoy the seperate modes of play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can not wait to read the next book or watch the movie. Could not stop reading.  Awesome.  Gonna start the next book now
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I've been a 007 fan since it began with Sean Connery and I don't think anyone will replace him, but Daniel Craig brings out a Bond that is all too human.  This is a Bond you can relate to on a person level, but still keep the fantasy.  Welcome to Bond 2.0!  Skyfall is a celebration of the Bond legend, but it's a reboot to an updated version.  It reminds me of the latest Spiderman movie: nothing new, but reformulated to be more appealing to today's audience..
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it.  its so fun to play twilight sparkle has always been my favorite but besides hervits rainbow dash
B0026KX5PO|4.0|Simply put, this movie boasts fantastic locations, incredible writing and effortless acting. This hypnotic story sucks you in and takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. It runs long but you don't want to end. Could there be a sequel? Please?
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is a winner once again. This show always guarantees a laugh and never disappoints. Highly recommend!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great story and beautifully written!  I hope it has opened people's eyes about the challenges that kids face who are in the foster care system.  As a society, we need to do more to set these children up for success.  We can do the right thing and invest in their futures when they are children - or invest in their treatments and sadly, many times incarcerations, later in life.  40% of males exiting foster case are court involved within a year of aging out.  Our society needs to own this problem.
B000002J6F|5.0|Bought this album when it came out in 1972, and it played in my Volkswagen on a cross-country trip from Idaho to Georgia alternating only with Santana's &#34;Caravansari.&#34;  I loved the &#34;Manassas&#34; back then, and 40 years later it still stands up as one of my all-time favorites.  If Mr. Stills is holding on to any live Manassas shows, I beg him to release them.  I cannot recommend this album any higher, it is just killer stuff.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The fact that they actually sang on the set, as apposed to just lip-synching, makes it all the more amazing. All of the actors and actress were wonderful, Anne Hathaway truly deserved her oscar, her performance was fantastic. It's a shame it didn't win for movie of the year.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I absolutely love Breaking Bad.  This video was available right away and I enjoyed the episode as well.  Love it!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This fits perfectly and looks great. Protects the phone very well. The only negative is it can tend to get a little hazy over time, but I guess that's what happens with a clear case.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I like the previous version better. it had the tabs on the bottom for whatever forecast you wanted including radar. This version is very Bland!!!!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This series is truly amazing!  I'm really looking forward to watching the third season.  Maggie Smith is a class act as always.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I only finished the book to see what could happen and I was very disappointed with that also..and then called my friend to tell her...
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I've read the Four Agreements more than once and I keep coming back to it every few years when I need to remember the Four Agreements. I recommend this book to everyone..
B008764ZQ4|4.0|Love the songs, they took me back to my younger days.  I didn't know Tom Cruise could sing, he didn't do bad at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A fast read, interesting subject matter and although I haven't read the other books in the series I'm sure I will enjoy them as well as the Hunger Games
B001E7EONC|4.0|I liked it but there wasn't as much action in it as most of Jason Statham's other movies.  He is a good action star.
B00006RIO7|5.0|lost my first cd...then ordered another.  love the movie and music.  the songs are so good and the singing is awesome.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Like the fact that this little puzzle can allow me to unwind with it's well orchestrated music, and keep the Ole Brain from fatiguing with it's simple, but well maintained puzzles and game mechanics.
0385349947|5.0|Sandberg's book combines stories from her own experience with data on gender issues and a call for action by women and for women. It's primarily intended for any woman wanting advice on how to sit at any table she wants. to. Sandberg's primary assertion is that, despite earning over half of college degrees, women hold only 14% of C-suite jobs and 17% of board seats.<br /><br />Sandberg contends that women face not only institutional barriers, but additional ones within themselves. Many take themselves out of the running for career advancement because they want to have a family, even before they have chosen a partner. (Sandberg's husband, David Goldberg, is a pediatric neurosurgeon with whom she shares child-raising duties on a 50/50 basis.) The single most important career decision a woman makes is 'Is she going to have a life partner, and is that partner going to support her career?'<br /><br />Women are given messages throughout life that they shouldn't lead. In addition, data show that as women become more successful, they are liked less, while men are liked more. While at Google, Sandberg noticed that men reached for opportunity much more quickly than women and were more impatient about their own development. Such a bias towards action and initiative is a key to being and becoming a leader.<br /><br />Sandberg also relates some of her past insecurities, some of which continue today. Yet, she learned how to take a deep breath and 'keep her hand up.' Stated another way, women need to believe in themselves, and 'lean in.'<br /><br />Sandberg believes we need to explicitly encourage men to sponsor/mentor women; in her case, it was Larry Summers. Unfortunately, senior men in the workplace are afraid to be alone with women because people may think something inappropriate is happening.<br /><br />One key way Sandberg balances career and family is by having a practice of going home at 5:30 to spend time with her children.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|So the game itself is not bad, the continual bombardment of ads every few puzzle is annoying as a burr in your sock. Not to mention that it lets you know about other games the company offers and that there are more puzzles. Now I could buy the ad free edition, however no, I think that after I purchase the ad free I'll still get reminders about the expansions and other games, until I buy those expansions and are left with the purchase of the other games offered, then maybe, just maybe I'll be rid of all the popups. That is until a new game or expansion is available, then I'll weep, for I will realize what a fool I was to buy into this kind of marketing tactic.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.  ANOTHER ACTION PACKED<br />MOVIE.  IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANYONE COULD LIVE<br />THROUGH SUCH AN EXPERIENCE.  I RECOMMEND THIS<br />BOOK.  YOU WILL ENJOY IT!
B0000AFX64|1.0|THe sound track on this fails to impress and requires you to tune the volume almost all the way up just so that you can hear the audio. The video is great but the audio if poor.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love all the books and look forward to more adventures. Jaime and Claire are almost like family. I have read the series 4 times and never get tired of them.
B0000004F9|2.0|I love Ayers later solo work with the Whole World, and thought his last album Unfairground Attraction was a marvelous return to form, but these albums feel flat. I've a Peel Sessions recording which includes a few tracks from the Soft Machine's first album, and they're way better than the studio versions (We Did It Again is awesome).
B00BF123WG|4.0|Initially I did not want to see it as I hate slanted political movies, but found this to me more an entertaining documentary type move, well done.  Held my interest the full two hours.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|My 8- and 14-year old kids love them, and this still hold together after 30+ years as great movies. &#34;It's like Harry Potter, but with spaceships&#34; was the 8-year old's review.
0545265355|5.0|I saw the movie, and it made me want to read all three books, but if I wanted the series.  This was priced right, and a way to have all three in a good package on the shelf.  No dissapointment, good quality books.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I feel like I may damn this with faint praise, which isn't my intention. I guess this feels uneven, with some tracks already on regular rotation on my playlists, and others feeling repetitive.<br /><br />Update: I never usually update reviews, but this isn an exception. I took my older daughter to see Alt-J live a few months back, and have become a convert. This is an album and a band that deserve their accolades.
B00BSBXA98|3.0|Very well made, beautiful, and it is what you expect, CirqueduSoleil after an hour although beautiful gets BOORING.  Turned if off at 58 minutes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book is very good with a great love story BUT might need to be rated xxxx for some of the actions in the book
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think the game is good. But ive bin playing this game for over a month and I have no mystery boxed or power ups. Also when ever I open the game a add pops up and I get sent to amazon.com but other then that I like the game
B00AEFXKUI|5.0|Braveheart has been around for a while but it's certainly worth watching again and again. Unlike current movies, it does not have obscenities, explicit sex and deafening rock &#34;music&#34;.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It was so cool I love this game but the movie was amazing can't wait for number 2 you should make a sequel for the game
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I ordered this and it was an excellent price to start with. I got it very quickly. I really like the case and I thought that the extra footage was good as well. I really think it does a good job of capturing the war in the pacific and how tragic it was. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in World War II
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Was hooked the very first episode!  Spent two weeks watching season 1 and season 2. Just now on season 3.  Keep them coming!
B00006CXSS|5.0|An amazing story and a must buy for anyone who is interested in the history of World War II. I would recommend it to anyone, it even has an extra hour of footage about the vets and the things that were put into the making of it. If you enjoy this you have to check out &#34;the pacific&#34; as well.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fun game just wish it was more easyier to control and it is a fun game try it out. though it could be better
B009JZVT70|5.0|I love watching Once Upon a time both on amazon and on TV every night and hope that the show would move on to a third season.
0374533571|5.0|This book brought into focus how mental illness has an affect on the entire family. It was interesting to see the faulty thoughts processes and rituals by the main character.
0345803485|5.0|This book had a great love story. I could not put it down. So much has been said about the &#34;sex&#34; part of the book, but I feel the beautiful love story and the beautiful writing style has been sorely overlooked. nancy katzer
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really do like the game it's a different of game that I am accustomed to playing which makes it interesting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great visuals and the horses are cute. I enjoy the competitions and training. It cool to groom also. Thumbs up
1400097029|5.0|John Banville is a poetic novelist whose love of language and image astonishes with its seductive power to arrest the reader on almost every page.  The Sea is not a novel for young people.  it is a deliciously slow read, insightful, and deeply felt. I read it, and then immediately turned back to the first page to read it again.  Just as good the second time.  I am so glad to have happened upon this brilliant author.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It`s okay, well done, suspenseful, but, to me, something is missing. I was not captured. Furthermore, it`s too much different from what actually happened. In other words : it`s Hollywood. )(
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are catching up with this series, and it's a treat to watch.  Very well written and acted.  Beautifully done.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|i copied the hacked password the app gave me into the wireless password thing, but jt says the pass is incorrect.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I wanted to see it in theaters, but I missed it so when I saw it was finally on Amazon I put it in my watch list. I laughed several times and it had adventure (of course), so all around I really liked it, especially Sandman.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Our boys love Woody and Buzz and really enjoyed this one, the funniest part is that in the credits Mr. Potato head has an issue with his face parts falling out and tells the kids to 'get out of his butt'...so from the whole movie they pick up that quote.  Funny stuff in raising twins.
B008220D5K|2.0|I saw the previews and when the movie was out I had friends that said it was so-so.  The movie was available to rent via Amazon so I took a gamble.<br /><br />From the very first scene it hit me.  This actress (mann) is god awful!  Who did she sleep with to get this role.  Horrible acting is an understatement plus she has this irritating baby voice that makes me ill.  She is just unbelievable in this role.  The movie never seems to go anywhere and stumbles and drags about like roadkill just before it settles in the the emergency lane for its final rest.<br /><br />Oh well sometimes it a miss!<br /><br />The Good:  Nothing<br /><br />The Bad: Mann - she is horrible<br /><br />Overall: Paul Rudd was wasted in this movie
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Potente flash capaz de utilizarse montado en la cámara como fuera. Potencia suficiente para mis necesidades, versátil y capaz de funcionar como flash maestro o esclavo (inclusive fuera de la cámara de manera inalámbrica).
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Very good and I have read the other books by Dan Brown they are also very good for winning the Nobel Prize
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|What a great movie for everyone!  Wreck-It Ralph's characters are dynamic and heartwarming.  It's difficult not to love this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow !people you will love to hate. Reading this left me unsettled. I didn't know I could be drawn into understanding such completely flawed characters,rooting on for the demise of a fictional  person..The ending is perfectly unsatisfyingly flawed
B007IK44CK|5.0|I was interested in seeing all of Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movies. I intend to watch the others as I get time.
B00012L786|2.0|I had high hopes for this film. With Sam Fuller directing, and Richard Widmark starring, I expected a film noir. It is, but it's also a spy film, and that's a combination that just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Thelma Ritter is wonderful as a stoolie named Moe, but she can't save this uneasy coupling of two genres that don't go together. This is one noir I'll have to pass by.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This was a terrible movie,if this is what movies have come too,society is in trouble.I hope kids aren't watching this filth.I am a hardcore construction worker and this movie is disgusting to me.requested a refund and got it.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|This movie was funny and poignant and actually got progressively funnier and more interesting.  I laughed out loud several times.  However, at almost 2 and 1/2 hours it's a little long for this type of movie.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|It's shipped very good and was everything like the product was described in the ording I will use this sellar again
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|If you like those kind of movies that you never know what will happen next this is one of them. Anthony Hopkins does an amazing job at keeping you<br />on the edge of your seat. It is a thinking mans movie with some great action as well.Even though alec baldwin plays kinda a bad guy he also adds his own little twist to this action, adventure in the wilderness with \\"The Bear\\"  Love, Love Loved it
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Time for Pete to retire, he's too tired. I'll give Kay one more round. Lucy needs someone to cause her to smile again.everyone is just so down.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|My 2 year old loves it app. Teaches the letters, helps with fine motor skills, and helps identify different animals/objects. The only thing is I wish it wasn't so repetitive, my son gets bored after a couple letters. But overall good for about 2-3.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|A friend suggested I might like modern Family.  As soon as I started to watch it I started to laugh out loud.  This is why It gets 5 stars from me.  We need more programs that make us laugh and feel good.
1558908420|5.0|great movie at a great price<br />dvd has no visible scratches and plays great<br />definitely would buy used dvds again
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon, Eva and Cary will always be a part of my life and I will always love them. I felt like kicking their butts at times I loved, laugh and cried with all 3 of them, I also felt there pain, depression and sorrow. Sylvia did a wonderful job bringing them to life and can't wait what she has in store for us in book 3!
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|it made all of the games on my kindle stop working so I had to redownload all of them. it took 15 days!
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My 2 and 4 year olds love this game. They want to count all the time now. I love how it goes with the book also
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love goole as my search engine I can get around alot easier and find what I want.  It give me more options on the subject.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Before I hate on this movie, I want to say that I was entertained and enjoyed it.  In that sense, it was a success.<br /><br />This movie has very little to do with the Tolkien book.  The screenplay makes no pretense at keeping it in line with the book.  It works pretty well, but if you are purist, skip the movie...it will only annoy you.  Whoever wrote the screenplay seems to have been more interested in matching it to the LOR movies than making the story work.<br /><br />The good stuff:<br /><br />1.  The acting is good.  Martin Freeman is particularly good as Bilbo.  He begins as a stereotypical polite-little-Arthur-Dent-Brit and transforms gracefully into a bolder, more confident Bilbo.  He brings a wry humor to the part that you will enjoy.  All of the dwarves did a good job, given the script.<br /><br />2.  Adding Radagast \\"the brown\\" to the story worked well.  His animals were fun.  His character, costume and acting are all good.  I particularly loved the bird crap running down his head.<br /><br />3.  The sets are well done and believable, just like the Lord of the Rings. (The CG backgrounds and scenes are NOT well done at all, but the real props and sets are good.)<br /><br />4.  The makeup and consumes are fun.  Some of the dwarves look very good.  Their movements on screen are  believable.  When they run, they run like dwarves.<br /><br />The bad stuff:<br /><br />1.  It's too dark and brooding.  The Hobbit is meant to be light hearted and humorous.  This is not.  They totally fail to capture the tone of the book.  The comedy seems forced and out of place.  In the original book, the dwarves are naive and optimistic and only Gandalf seems to understand how grim and hopeless things really are.  The absurdity of the odds against them and their complete confidence was one of the key features of the book.  I missed the \\"holiday outing\\" tone of the book.<br /><br />2.  All the dwarfs are indestructible killing machines?  Really?  All of them?  Even Bombur?  Instead of quaking in their boots and bumbling their way through fights, they attack like commandos and wade through thousands of goblins without a scratch.  Instead of fighting with walking sticks and wearing hoods like the original book, they show up at Bag-end dressed for battle and carrying their own weight in armor and weapons.  All of them are martial arts masters instead of miners and merchants.  This characterization doesn't work with the costumes and attempted humor.  You can't have it both ways.<br /><br />3.  Thorin is an epic hero.  Instead of a cranky, self important, greedy old guy, this version of Thorin is a sexy, young, good looking version of Aragorn.  The original character is defined by his stubborn, arrogant will and sense of entitlement, and that's often the only thing that keeps them going.  The movie character is nothing like that.  Why not make him a vampire while you are at it?<br /><br />4.  They desperately needed a combat consultant and maybe even a historian.  The weapon designs, armor designs, tactics and combat movements were horrible.  Whoever choreographed the combat sequences has clearly never seen a real fight.  Maybe this is less noticeable to young viewers who are used to playing video games, but it was annoying and very distracting to me.<br /><br />The really horrible stuff:  (The worst CG in history?)<br /><br />This movie is loaded with computer graphics.  That can be an excellent thing, but in this case, it's not.  It's poorly executed and entirely over the top.  I wish the producers of this movie had saved a few bucks and toned it down about 95%.  When the characters overcome four impossible threats a second for 6 minutes straight, it's hard to worry about them much.  You lose all suspense and all sense of reality.  In a sense, the CG destroys the whole movie and turns an otherwise fine production into a joke.<br /><br />1.  The computer generated sets are unbelievable and unrealistic enough to ruin the tone of the movie.  Hundreds of rickety rope bridges, buildings on top of crazy spires, impossible architecture etc.  Every cliff is an impossible overhang.  The lighting and shading of the underground scenes was horrible and some of the backgrounds seem to have been drawn by school kids.<br /><br />2.  The physics are terrible and cartoon-like.  Inertia is wrong.  Falling rates are wrong.  Running speeds are wrong.  Birds don't fly like birds.  A warg pushes over a mature tree, which then topples several other trees.  The characters fall hundreds of feet and get buried by landslides and then hop right back up as if they had fallen 2 feet.  They get thrown off cliffs and nobody even gets winded.  They narrowly miss being killed by tons of falling rocks in almost every CG assisted scene.  The running fight in the goblin tunnels was one of the worst CG assisted fight scenes I have ever seen (it was spectacularly bad).  The stone giant scene was insulting.  Wow.<br /><br />3.  The CG is poorly matched to the real actors.  In several scenes, the angles are wrong and the actors are clearly not oriented to the CG stuff.  In the troll scene, for instance, Bilbo was hiding from them in clear view, yet acted as if he was behind cover.<br /><br />4.  EVERYTHING was over the top and inconsistent.  Gandalf can set off a Nuke apparently while he is in the goblin caves....but immediately loses that ability and has to resort to throwing pine cones a few scenes later? Why not another nuke?  The spectacular and erratic nature of the CG really detracts from the film and overwhelms the otherwise fine production.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a watchable and enjoyable movie, but don't expect too much.  Hype and marketing set expectations too high sometimes.  Enjoy it for what it is.  Or maybe just read the book.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because it is slightly less addicting than the first season.  The first season gets 5 stars for sure.<br />I love the character Emily Thorne.  She is a very strong, admirable female lead who is carrying out her desire for revenge on those who deserve it.  The fun of it is, she goes after people the way we, in real life, can only fantasize about doing.  It's fun to live vicariously through her!
B002QGSYRC|3.0|I went for this book because I am starving for books written on the subject of the Korean War.  I have read many books on Americas different endeavors into war but I am lacking when it comes to our war in Korea.  Like any war, one book will not answer all of the questions - The Coldest Winter is no different.  If you are looking for the who, what, and why (outside of MacArthur) you won't find it here.  It's a great book if you are a person who already dislikes MacArthur.<br /><br />In the end, if you know nothing about Americas involvement in the Korean War, you will have a better understanding as to why the war pretty much ended where it started.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I think everyone should read this. When you realize what our food really is, you will shop differently and hopefully eat better.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Honestly game of thrones is an amazingly written and deeply engrossing book. I recommend this to everyone and if you'vte only watched the series it really builds on your knowledge and adds more to the story
B00AFEY354|2.0|I read Go Ask Alice as a young teenager, and was deeply disturbed by it, especially as it was touted as a true story. I remember being shocked to learn much later that it wasn't real - but then, thinking about it, realised how incredibly gullible I had been. I remembered thinking how the incredible number of \\"bad things\\" that happened to one person should have tipped me off - ever single issue from every afterschool special was there!<br />That's what I feel about Chbosky's \\"semi-autobiographical\\" story, and I've only seen the movie, so I missed the witnessing-a-rape, abortion etc issues from the book!  Are these important issues? Yes, certainly, but if you throw them all in at once, you kind of dilute the effect they're supposed to have.<br />I found the situations unrealistic - Charlie is supposed to be 14/15. How does he get to hang out with seniors (especially if he's supposed to be a wallflower?) and let's not forget that boys don't mature physically as quickly as girls do - so a Harvard-bound senior wants to be his girlfriend? Really? And her aggressive pursuit of him does not give him flashbacks to unwanted sexual advances his aunt subjected him to - again, really?<br />Then there's the title; Charlie is too in-demand to be a wallflower. The film takes itself too seriously: we're supposed to sneer at the line \\"poetry writes me!\\" but \\"I feel infinite!\\" is OK? I tried to like this film, but I'd have to be the gullible young teenager who believed \\"Go ask Alice\\" was real to be able to do that.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Game has many levels which keeps you interested. Italso has a storyline which makes it more interesting than just a mindless match 3 game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Almost didn't get this.<br />GET IT!<br />It's that good!<br />just like the Invaders of old times. Very addicting. Great time waster.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Who knew that doing the same thing order and over to be so much fun? A simple yet elegant game that can keep me entertained for hours on end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second time reading this series... once before the movie, now again after.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  Look forward to other writings by Collins.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I watched this movie for pure entertainment as I do most movies.  It was well acted, and tight for the most part.  But if anyone still believes that this is \\"fact based,\\" at this point, I would beg to differ...as would a great many Americans.  Seems to me Hollywood is carrying the political line here.  Blaming bin Laden, and carrying out a \\"search and destroy\\" mission which took ten years?  And then buried at sea in the Muslim tradition?  A political movie, and meant to deflect and detract, and nothing more to my way of thinking...and so many others who have been silenced in the years since 911.
B0053FANPY|5.0|This movie is as great as the other fast and the furious movies. Would recommend to others to get and watch.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|That's not just a terrible pun; so far, season 2 is the best. The raw energy of Shane and Rick constantly butting heads, Darryl trying to tame his loner personality, Herschel trying to understand the walker plague in the face of his spirituality and religion, Glenn and Maggie making googly eyes and the constant game of, How the Hell Did Carl Get Out of the House Again?!<br /><br />The season suffers from being overlong and from sacrificing some characters' true motivations just to create manufactured conflict. Also, the dialogue can drift into Days of Our Lives territory.<br /><br />But still, look at that zombie head! The screwdriver comes out and actually kind of works as a key to open the DVD set. You HAVE to stick it in his eye to get it open!<br /><br />So HEAD on out and pick one up! Wait, that doesn't work.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I haven't yet seen the movie but look forward to seeing how the story plays out on screen.  Great story! Very touching and makes you think about mental illness in a new light.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh my fifty shades!!! I loved beyond belief these books. I don't read hardly ever, I mean ever!!! I just could not put it down from page 1 of book 1. There were nights my eyes burned from being so tired but  could not stop reading. Well written I feel like I know the characters in the story and really hope there's more to come.. Movie maybe???? Please.....
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book really makes you think about the &#34;what if&#34; of a zombie apocalypse.  Would you be prepared?  How would you handle the onslaught? Entertaining for sure!  Look forward to seeing the movie even if it is a very different story from the book.  The book is a series of many stories and would be difficult to film that way & probably not so appealing as a movie, so I understand the Hollywood change-up.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|I had to replace this album because the last one got stolen. I ordered a used on that was like new, I have been listening to it just about everyday. This is my favorite album by Jamiroquai, so I love it!!!
B003B02PEU|4.0|This is the first Grisham novel I've ever read.  It was a very enjoyable story and I can say I'll definitely read another by Mr. Grisham any time.  In fact, I will soon be reading The Racketeer :)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I had been hearing about this game for quite some time now and gotten good raves about it so thought I'd try it out. I like it.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|This movie, although still good is my least favorite in the PA series.  The acting is surprisingly really good and there are plenty of jump scares.  However the suspenseful parts are few and far between.  Also, you could've removed this movie from the franchise and you would lose nothing from the story.  This movie adds nothing to the story.  If you're a huge fan of the PA series get it but dont expect a lot of suspense.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game Ive had it before on my my old kindle and got my new one and downloaded it again! I love it! (:
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of my all time favorites...never get tired of watching it! Wish they would bring it back and explore some of the character's pasts.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Thank you for making many versions of the Bible as well as many devotional programs free for everyone to have easy access.  The only downfall I've found is that I cannot use the SEARCH feature unless I am connected to internet.  It would nice if I could SEARCH a downloaded version even while offline.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One of my all time favorite series...couldn't  have the series without this movie. They keep the garbage programs around and get rid of the good ones.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I did not like the ending of the movie because I expected something similar to the 1986 and the 2006 versions.  Where is the scene of Jane Eyre going up to Rochester's bedroom carrying a tray and giving him some water?  Where is the conversation in which Jane and Rochester talk about Saint John and his family?  Besides, things happen too fast in this version.  It seems to be a brief summary of the above-mentioned versions.
B0017SWSCW|1.0|Too contrived -- not believeable.  I would not recommend.  I don't believe I have read anythinjg of Jeffry Archer's books I enjoyed.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The best bond movie ever, at least for me. A lot of people don't like Daniel Craig as Bond, but I do. The movies are of course movies, but he plays Bond as flawed and more realistic, I just really like it. May not be a lot other other peoples cup of tea, but if so then don't watch it.
B003V1WTMM|3.0|I always enjoy a story located in British  countryside.  There was a good mix of characters and interest in their lives; some intrigue and a sad conclusion.  I would recommend to some of my friends
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Pretty much anything with Denzel Washington in it is good and again he gives a great performance. He does a great job and some people don't like the ending, but I liked it. Also John Goodman does great in it as well!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I love Ken Follett's work. But I felt this book to drag.  As much as I enjoy the wonderful historical basis. I found myself expecting a pop quiz.
B00138CT16|4.0|I love the music from the movie, and to be honest, I use this on low volume to help me get to sleep. No, it's not boring, it just helps me to fall asleep faster and peacefully. Would buy again.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone seeking to transform your life for the better. Learn how to not take things other people do or say personally.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|It's a pretty good movie, I was hoping that it was a psychological thriller and it was, it's a pretty good movie.
B00BESCJII|2.0|Not that I expected some enlightened film, but high school was depressing enough the first time. I guess I expected a movie with the word 'perks' in the title to have some sort of uplifting message. I'm sure the book was much better; but I feel the movie fell short of making me appreciate it. Glad I didn't buy it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a good app and I like the fact that it can be used on all of my devices.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|The game is good. It does have a glitch but it turns out it helps you out. Sometimes you will get a pair and it wont clear so you get to move again.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Would it be bold if I said The Hobbit is my favorite out of the saga?<br />Hate all you want, but Peter Jackson really did a fantastic job. Yes the other movies are great, but this installment stood on it's own in a very refreshing way. It is not afraid to be a little goofy, but also be dark at the same time. I like any film that has a lure, so to be able to see the lure of the dwarves was awesome and interesting. The atmosphere is there, and middle earth greets the audience with great familiarity. One may not be able to compare it to the other films really...there's a certain direction Peter Jackson has taken. Though it may not be dramatically different, it is very much new. I'm digging it.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This movie is perfect for couples who have been married a while.  So funny, my husband and I could not stop laughing.
0783240287|5.0|I have love this broadway musical for a long time. It is so good to finally have my own copy. Even if you are not a religious person. It is still a great story and my 2 year old granddaughter and I watched it together and I still remember all the words to the songs.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Sam did an awesome job as the coach. I love watching movies with a positive message. wish more kids would watch and learn from movies like this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read the series  total of their times so far. This books help u to believe in happy ever after.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|This movie is great and delivers in every area.  Can't wait for the next installment.  Watch the extras from Peter Jackson at the end.
B009GEFXLC|3.0|I loved the first season. The writing was smart and sharp. The relationships between Castle, Becket, his mother, and his daughter were well written and interesting. As the series has progressed it seems the writing has been 'dumbed down', taking time to explain things that don't need explaining and the relationships have been simplified to caricatures. I can't think of a specific \\"jump the shark\\" moment but, sadly, I won't miss it when the series is eventually cancelled.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I thought this film was excellent.  My wife thought it was to serious and has some slow parts.  I would say it's not a film for everyone.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I loved the film, but I'd have enjoyed it a great deal more if I'd purchased it, instead of enjoying Amazon's new digital download option. It was interrupted so many times to load that I turned it off twice and didn't really get to enjoy the narrative. Don't rent it.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Who doesn't love her voices.  She is so unbelievalbe.  This is an excellent show.  I wish she didn't drop so many &#34;F&#34; bombs but she is so real you just want to hug her.  You can feel every emotion she feels when she signs these songs.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Very well done. Characters in the movie do grab you in addition to the action. I did not see all James Bond movies, but this is definitely the best one I saw. Enjoy
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Loved this book.  The ending made me think about my life and stop to see what's going on around me with my friends and just life in general.
B007N31YH0|5.0|What isn't to like?...A young Robert Redford and Paul Newman still looking sooo good.  Loved the soundtrack and a great story line...Good movie to watch and be wishing I was still \\"back in the day!\\"
B005GFPZYK|5.0|No one should be a Citizen and not understand War and its Consequences.Absent the military commitment,first hand accounts of war from warriors is a way to understand.<br />These latest wars are 24/7 in Indian Country,without the benefit of the 8th Air Force to obliterate everything.No relief,ever.<br />These guys deserve the best we have to offer.They often do not get that.
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|The movie did not live up to the excellent standards of the first three movies, it was long and boring. The writers and producers missed the boat entirely by going on a ridiculous quest outside the Shire. They should have told the story of young Bilboa Baggins, other characters living in the Shire; and life surrounding the Shire with snippets of what was to come in the films we have already seen. Sorry guys, I am a fan, but you really lost me on this one. :(
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My hair stylist told me about this show two weeks ago, I had never even heard of it before. From the very beginning I was hooked. Every actor was cast brilliantly! Once I finished season one I panicked, hoping for another season. I was thrilled to see TWO more seasons! This is one of those shows that you hope never ends, it will be hard to wait until September for season four. Thank you Masterpiece for such an amazing piece of work!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Denzel's performance was terrible. I rented this movie because of this actor, but the movie left me sorry that I spent money to view it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have always enjoyed Peter Falk in Coloumbo and just noticed the boxed complete series for a pretty reasonable price, so I jumped at it, and have no regrets.  Great quality.  I recommend this set for any Columbo fan.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I couldn't get through this film in one sitting. Kept rewinding, fast-forwarding thinking I had missed something. I didn't, it was terrible.
0452295548|5.0|Essential reading for anyone who loves someone with a brain injury. Insight into the potential and greatness of the brain.
B006TLFPKO|3.0|Guess writer's run out of ideas when they get to #4. I like the Twilight movies, but this one did not measure up to my expectations.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|I feel the book was well written and interesting. However, no matter how well it described the power of habits, it didn't do much in detailing how to create good habits. I guess I would LOVE the book that builds upon this to show how to develop good habits.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|we liked it, enjoyed the cinematography, it moved a little slowly at first, but overall, an enjoyable way to spend an evening.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is actually a lot better than I thought it was going to be. There seems to be a lot of levels. The invisible part cool never seen anything like that before.
1451695195|4.0|I like the ease of use on my iPad, the fact that with Audible.com I can listen to this on my car radio.<br />The price was right.
B005DOKIYG|3.0|i was not happy with the quality or the appearance of the cover. it looked and felt cheap and was not inexpensive. if i was able to find the paperwork, i would have sent it back, i bought another cover that opens like a book.
