B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this ap was a total life saver!  I found it was very easy to use and its accompanying apps were also easy to use. I use evernote for shopping lists,  projects and pictures, I even kept a recipe notebook. I highly recommend this if you surf around for projects, crafts, food ideas, or anything else you can imagine.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|John Carter is a Civil War Army Captain who somehow leaps into Red Planet Mars, at a time when Mars/Barsoom is dying.  Predators are all around and war is being fought.  There are creatures that we would call \\"aliens\\" and there are folks who look like John.  The governing Goddess even sends some transparent beings to give powers to the bad guy and there is a Princess who may be forced to marry the bad guy.  There are wild looking space ships and lots of fighting.  Enjoyable, action, futuristic.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|...beautiful heart-touching and unforgettable story about a dog's loyalty to his owner, based on a true story in Japan.  I was recommended by a friend to watch this movie about a dog and I thought there was nothing better than \\"Fluke\\" until I decided to watch.  I have never cried this much in my entire life on a movie until I saw Hachi.  Captivating from beginning to end, you will need a towel in replacement of facial tissue, and I am very serious! I highly recommend for people of all ages to watch this breath-taking story.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|And the first episode on Disk 1 played perfectly.  Unfortunately I realized I'd MEANT to order season 2 so I won't be watching anymore from this set until I rectify that issue (meaning I'm ordering season 2 now).  But I do look forward to seeing the rest...after I catch up.  :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It has been a long time since I stayed up until 3am to finish a book. The series is very well written and is more then about the BDSM content. The main characters had to admit to there flaws in what made them them and communicate.  I must say it was truly a great series that I am glad it is was ended well yet you did not want it to end.  If you are able to handle the BDSM content and yes there is some.  I would reccomend this book.  Read it in 2 and half days all three books now I need a nap!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Won't even go past the first real level of the game without locking up. Looks like they might need to test it a bit more.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend for tablet users.
B005723JSQ|5.0|If you like Sophie Kinsella you will love this new book & hopefully this reoccuring character!  The plot really makes all of the characters likeable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game I can pick whichever game I want to play and if I get bored with it I can switch. all while I'm earning more points to buy more games.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|dont mind the lack of capitalization i dont know how to capitalize while using the kindle. ok this deserves a three but i gave it a two so you know how bad it is. im looking at the original 5 as i type this. i dont understand why everyone loves this book because its terrible. really. maybe its just a bunch of blind fans but its not fair for this book to get such good rep for being a percy jackson book while other titles of less known authors write better books but cant get off the ground. and its not because its in third person. its not because the monsters were random because they were. its because the characters were flat, plot was terrible, and they randomly fall out of the sky. twice. whats the point of a flying robot dragon if it randomly crashes? ah thats right its for plot. righhttt. speaking of plot theres this vague idea of one thats shrouded in random monster fights and terrible protagonists. jason has like no emotion until the end which could be played off as tall, dark and troubled if it werent for piper (i think thats her name and it fits because she whines so much) dragging him down. that would have been an original charcter for rick and what i think he was going for. jason is actually kinda cool which is weird for percy jackson. and im not talking percy cool im talking words i cant use on this review like bada... unfortunately he has a grand total of two moments of awesomeness which are pretty well done which reflects well on the possible awesomeness of the roman camp. his special trinket wad a little disappointing as it turns into a sword and a spear. i wouldve rathered it stayed a coin mayb blessed by zeus excuse me jupiter. id like to see him team up with percy or perhaps battle him. as for piper...did i mention she whines? and is selfish. and is an all around bad character. leo was great except for his magic tool belt. like really who walks around with a tool belt? but fine except its just a deus ex machina device. theres a part where hes fendingoff an enemy but pulling oil out of his tool belt and lighting it on fire. ok. he does this for a good 5 minutes. while piper and jason think up a plan. they dont. and conviently get saved by someone else. its a dumbed down version of the manticore battle. yes thats a hint. as for the villians they fluctuated wildly in terms of good characters. that king who turns people to gold is in this book and wins best character award for being the most percy jacksonesque (yes i made that up) character in the book. plus he managed to make jason look cool. most others were terrible characters. it suffers the same overstuffing of characters that the first one had but worst becaue atleast those villians were interesting. i was going to give this a two but i was nice. its swallowable. on a side note the three protagonist all feel like thirteen yr olds. at best. i believe they're supposed to be atleast fifteen maybe 16. im 16 and wouldnt do half the stupid things they do. fortunately the second is better  p.s. found capitalization button;)
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I bought this 42 disc set for my wife and she is very pleased with it. It does include the two movies even though it doesn't mention it in the description. It's not Digital TV or High Definition quality but it is very good considering the age of the series when it appeared on TV. Great buy from Amazon!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|this is without doubt one of the best in the series and saved the series for me. i hated book one but this was on point. dont listen to those who say the characters were not good because they were great each with his own personality and emotions. rivals last olympian and battle of the labyrinth and trumps lost hero
B006P0FIGU|1.0|Milla Jovovich & Orlando Bloom must have been desperate. I love good action movies just like anyone else but this one is so over the top its desperate. Modern equipment and weapons were resembled and tried to give the movie some edge, as if these people had these types of weapons in that age, ...it was completely out of place...yes I love fantasy movies as well, but this was a near thrown together parody....absolutely no recognition the the real story of the 3 Musketeers..The story line & plot is pathetically weak, there were a few goo action scenes, but nothing we haven't seen before or nothing to rave over. Some scenes were and lines seemed as if they were actually trying to make a spoof movie. As well this movie was NOT about The 3 Musketeers...its about a young boy and his love interest the Princess, the Musketeers were more or less scenery and a prop to sell the movie, they actually did very little in the movie. The movie was just quite boring, the only reactions I had was the fat servant boy being picked on now and then, that was funny!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|takes too long to get enough credits to do anything, but other than that it is pretty fun! I like it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have enjoyed this app from day one and have it on my favorites. A few less adds would be nice.  There are so many solitaire options!  It is very User friendly.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm a writer. A romance writer. I'm used to the dirty stuff. Normally I'd want to congratulate a fellow author who sold a book for the amount of money this went for. But this is rewarding poor writing.<br /><br />I read the book because I saw a piece on Good Morning America about it. It is \\"the\\" book every women in America is reading - they reported. Scary. It's about a young girl being made a submissive by a dominant male who uses his wealth to his advantage. Why would women want to read about a girl being beaten? What does this say about us? I know it is not my fantasy. More like a nightmare.<br /><br />My suggestion is to use your reading time and monies more effectively.
0156027321|2.0|This was not a very good book. It is a book about telling stories for others and not for yourself as true religioun would have to satisfy. A boy giving explicit and meaningless details about his fantasy experience should not be satisfying to most intelligent readers. Meaningless details which exist only to prove a story that the boy makes up. 227 days has no meaning what so ever.<br /><br />So we see a character who KNOWS his story is just a story. That would be called a lie by most.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is the most relaxing brain teaser ever made.  The replay may be limited, but the price is right.  The only drawback I have encountered is lack of sleep after marathon sessions in the wee hours.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|The dye on this case rubbed off on EVERYTHING. Couldn't figure out why my fingers were all black! Don't waste your money unless you really enjoy washing your hands after reading.
B000O5B4C4|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The 2.35:1 (aspect ratio) video presentation of this movie in this Blu-Ray is excellent mostly.  The outdoor scenes looked fantastic.  Some of the inside scenes didn't look great, but were still very good.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has DTS-HD High Resolution 6.1 sound, which was good.  I didn't hear a whole lot of surround sound (there was some), nor did I hear any sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />The movie lasted just about 2 hours.  This is a very good Blu-Ray purchase, especially for the price.

B00000IFP6|5.0|I've been listening to these symphonies for more than fifty years, from Furtwangler to Dudomel, and I love these.  IMHO, they're meticulous (thank you Barenreither) yet lack nothing of Beethoven's passionate nature.
0307956350|5.0|You will be kept up at night trying to figure out who's who in this novel; who can Kate really trust, including her husband? A great debut and European locales keep you reading to the finish.
1451648537|4.0|This book does a great job of fleshing out the details of a person who most of us thought we knew.  He was both better and worse than I could have imagined. Besides presenting Jobs, warts and all, this book refreshes our memory of the amazing rise of computers, the Internet, and all the amazing gizmos we now take for granted.
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|The story is about an American (Clark Gable) residing in Africa and operating a business capturing game for distribution to zoos and circuses. Along comes Eloise Kelly (Ava Gardner) with a body that Clark Gable cannot resist. All is well until a couple of anthropologists arrive (including Grace Kelly-unrelated to Eloise Kelly) and the fireworks really begin. The women compete for the attention of Gable and rightly so. With a name like Kelly, Ava Gardner has already been set against the lovely Grace but Grace gets even.<br /><br />Eloise Kelly's purpose for being in Africa is to have a date with the Maharaja. However, it appears the Maharaja has stood her up and too bad for Ava. In the movie \\"Dial M for Murder\\", Grace Kelly makes a reference to photographs she is displaying taken with the Maharaja. To me, this is definitely payback directed at Ava Gardner's character in Mogambo who through no fault of her own was given the character name of Kelly.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing. Plenty of big game photos and scenic views of the African landscape gives the movie a very outdoors look, together with local tribesmen that appear in abundance. Something that will never be seen again.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I bought the 4-pack. I read the 4-pack, it started out great, then........... But I only finished reading the tome to find out the ending . There was none. Then I heard that there was a fifth volume out now. Naaah. After reading the reviews and after being left with such gripping details like the color of the uniforms, I will pass. Shame on you, Sir!<br /><br />Go back to the manner in which you started. You should have enough money by now.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Seth
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to....<br />-find verses<br />-read<br /><br />I like it a lot. very convenient. great for all ages. get it now. its amazing
B003VANOFY|1.0|Love the idea of these BUT...<br />They worked with any problems for a few hours... But shortly after they kept dropping wireless signal. Now the audio is crackling when it is working. I wanted to RMA them for replacements but Amazon will not let me due to their \\"out of stock\\". Checking the website it shows 2 in stock and a price increase of $30. I think they just what that extra money. GG not going to play this game with you Amazon, give me my money back.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Full depth of the bible, several translations, has audio to listen to scripture and delivers daily scripture. I'm appreciate this app greatly!
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|While this film isn't as good as the very first, it is an O.K. sequel unlike number 2 and both \\"vs. Alien\\" ones.  The opening sequence of Adrien Brody free falling from the sky is pretty cool so I was waiting for the movie to get going.  Eventually it does and does a nice job with the CGI and the Predator hunter make up.  Unfortunately the movie offers nothing in the way of surprises and is nothing new.<br /><br />Here's the deal.  Eight or nine bad-ass killers are kidnapped from Earth and dumped on a remote planet as game for the Preds.  They get knocked off one-by-one pretty much in the order of cast billing.  I admit I missed the first one, but I suspect Danny Trejo had to get to the \\"Machete\\" set.  We all know who survives and pretty much what's in store for the group.  Tropher Grace is in this group as a doctor? But why?  Lawrence Fishburne shows up for a few minutes but why?  Some decent action and green gore save it from dumpster.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer has a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1.  Both the audio and the video are of reference quality.  This alone would justify watching the film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i found the game quite exciting actuually. just the freedom you get to choose what you want to do. blarf
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for quick, fun and responsive game playing. Works everytime! Not a huge game player but love this one on my Kindle Fire! Looks nice too.
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|Totally not what I expected, but found myself hooked by the characters and couldnt put it down. A real eye opener about the war and how sometimes everything is not as it seems. Would highly recommend this book, dont be put off if it takes a while to get 'into' the story its well worth it.
B005E89X7E|5.0|As usual, Bernard Cornwell dazzles us with his story telling ability. Another work of literary art on his part!!!!<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates historical novels.

1439181780|5.0|I was reticent to get this book because I thought it was too similar to The Secret.  I am very gladly surprised that it definitely adds to it. It is more information about how to enact the secret with suggested steps and visualizations. I am grateful for this book.

1439156816|5.0|This book is without doubt the most constructive advice any writer could ever receive.  I have recommended it to every writer I know.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|Contagion is the story of how several people handle the after effects of a highly contagious virus that rapidly mutates and spreads worldwide.  Everyone from the husband of a woman who travels for business and catches it, high level officials from the Centers for Disease Control looking for a cure, an opportunistic/savvy blogger who decries the possible perils of pharmaceutically made vaccines and touts  holistic options instead, and an official working with the World Health Organization who is kidnapped as collateral  for the vaccine so a small village whose population has dwindled due to the virus can be saved is given a very plausible storyline.  The abundance of negative ratings on Amazon for this movie surprises me... I thought the movie was more than believable and the timeline and how everything unfolded worked.  There's death, fear, looting, selfishness and sacrifice and the great cast (Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishburne and others) made this great story even better.  5 stars!
0307959856|1.0|Perhaps I shouldn't be reviewing the book since I have not finished it and I have no intention of finishing it.  But I hope to warn off other readers or at least let other readers go in with low enough expectations that they can enjoy the book.  I am so glad I did not buy it.  However, I did wait a long time to get it from the library and was in a high sense of anticipation by the time it came.  My complaints are two-fold: way too much background information is given on the characters at the beginning and it feels very contrived.  And then there is practically nothing between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy.  What is the point?  It feels like the author is using the setting and characters as a short-cut to actually developing her own.  Then, she doesn't even go anywhere with them.  The mystery part leaves me utterly uninterested as well.  Not worth my time.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|i love her music had to have her cd<br />the price was exceptionally great ordered it and am very happy i got it
B0008237BO|5.0|It goes without question in my opinion that Tupac Shakur is the greatest there ever was when it comes to hip-hop/rap. He is the definition of a rapper. The skills, the lyrics, the attitude, the distinctive voice, and most importantly the passion is what made 2Pac one of a kind. Technically speaking, in terms of skill, guys like Nas, Big L, Rakim and some of the boys from the Wu-Tang were better, but Pac spoke the word, the truth, his passion is truly something else, something that is lacking in all kinds of music nowadays, but thats another story.<br /><br />The Don Killuminati cements his legacy, it was his final stand before multiple albums were released after his death, albums which i consider to be the encore. This album by the way was recorded in 3 days, and production of the songs finished in 7 days, hense the name of the album. 12 tracks in 3 days, that shows Pacs famous 'just turn up. No bs and do the job. Leave' attitude that he had, and thats the way it should be.<br /><br />Before i list of the top 5 tracks, i will say that the intro to the album, called 'Bomb First' is without a dout the best intro of all time. Also it contains my favourite Makaveli qouate which is \\"its not about east or west, its about n*****  n' b****s, power n' money, ridas and punks...which side are you on?\\"...These lyrics are insane, and he meant it so the delivery was intense and very in your face.<br /><br />Top 5 tracks:<br /><br />1. Intro/Bomb First (its fantastic, featuring the usual apperances from his crew, the Outlawz)<br /><br />2. Hail Mary (a dark song, and Pac is the best at these real deep tracks. A must listen for anybody. \\"i ain't a killa but don't push me\\")<br /><br />3. Krazy (Argubly his most chilled out track that he ever created. The beat and the first two verses performed by Pac were so true and real for alot of people)<br /><br />4. To Live and Die In LA (Pac's most realist song since the famous 'I Ain't Mad At Cha' track on the classic All Eyez On Me album released earlier that year of 96')<br /><br />5. Life Of An Outlaw / Me And My Girlfriend (i couldn't chose between the two, and i could not single out either two of the songs)<br /><br />The above tracks are classics, and the other songs on the album are not filler, trust me, its still your usual dose of 2Pac greatness.<br /><br />RIP to the best, Tupac Shakur
B00003JRCQ|1.0|How does one enjoy a movie when the appearance of the actors detract from one's attention? The woman playing Anne was sightly. Eyebrows like Groucho Marks. Who did the actor's makeup, or was it that the directors and producers had a limited budget? So much for connection and chemistry, the story rambles on, and finally has a tad of merit in the last 5 minutes. Jane Austen would not be happy...
B0036EH3UC|5.0|BSG was well written all around. Plot twists, character development, good scenery and special effects, good action... the works. Also blending entertainment with messages of meaning, it's a much welcomed break from the dumbed down pointless TV shows that are pushed onto us now a days.<br /><br />Well worth the price tag.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|This film just won an Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year.  Now that I've seen it I can well understand why.  Not only is the acting and direction absolutely impeccable, but it is the unique way of telling this story that is what makes it great.  It is a silent film.  Well, almost.  There is a handful of words used very sparinglingly. It is all told with gestures and subtitles and it is amazing in its complexity and in the emotions it evokes. The team who created it are indeed geniuses.<br /><br />Starring Jean Dujardin as a silent film star who is disposed when talkies become popular and Berenice Bejo as the young woman who loves him, this is an amazing film with the sweep and drama of a classic.  I also must mention the little dog who could also be considered a star in its own right.<br />`<br />I have nothing but accolades to give to this very fine film.  It is something really original.  Make sure to see it if you can.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is very poorly written and full of spelling errors. The characters are unlikable and shallow. There is no substance to this story. Overall i thought this book was exremely boring and disappointing.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|This was a great product and it did everything it was supposed to do, my radio played with no issues and it charged my iPhone 4S
B004F77SHC|5.0|Like so many others, the characters and actors lure me back to these improbable stories.  I thought the film was as good as its predecessors until I listened to the audio commentary with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.  It is quite revealing about how their relationship has developed since their commentary with Catherine Hardwicke for Twilight.  The pair are so funny together that I have listened to them just for the laughs they provide.  They discuss In-And-Out Burgers, their hair/wig problems on the film, Canadian shawarmas with excessive hot sauce and all manner of inane stuff.  But it is all discussed with such warm comraderie amd humor that I really enjoyed listening. It is my favorite aspect of the film and the reason I gave it the high rating.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|iv gotta give the movie a 4 out of 5 because some of the characters look like they should...except PEETA! {even though I haven't seen the movie...yet!}

0440246016|2.0|I always read Child's Jack Reacher stories as summer beach time reading and he does not disappoint me here. He easily reaches the two star level and holds it almost all the way through the book. The plot is light and breezy. even though Reacher does lose four of his former men, some of whom seem to be worthy of reading about. No reason is given for why the men are killed by throwing them out of an airplane (sorry, helicopter, is there still any reason?). However when serving in the military the men formed a bond which they call into play now even though they are civilians and are working as such. But they feel that bond should be resuscitated and it is called forth, Reacher interprets it and feels the call. Slowly the remnants of the special investigation unit reassemble, only four in one group with Reacher but this is the vengeful arm. Despite the odds it is enough and revenge is sought and found. Reacher employs his usual strong arm stuff, maybe not so much as in  some of his other stories but for summer reading it is a pleasant read. The suspense seems to be all wrapped up in the question of reuniting the unit, how many can be called up and how many will be lost? All other action is minimal, just Reacher at his usual, and with not much sex. Still, somewhat interesting.
B000002NZO|4.0|I only recently started listening to Peter Gabriel era Genesis, and nobody told me not to like this album. It wasn't until after reading the reviews here and elsewhere that I realized this album isn't revered by most of the prog-rock Genesis fans.<br />Phil Collins and Steve Hackett weren't members of the band yet but that doesn't mean that the playing and the songs on this album aren't solid as hell.<br />In fact it has some of my favorite songs on it, I personally think \\"Stagnation\\" is one of the greatest Genesis songs ever.<br />The sound of the album is that of early 70's prog-rock, not too heavy most of the time, with long flourishing instrumental interludes peppered with Peter Gabriels' endlessly interesting lyrics and vocal delivery.<br />The production is muddy like most people say but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it.<br />If you are here in the first place you must be musically adventurous so why not give this album a try?<br />You could always go over to Spotify and listen to the entire album before you buy it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I initially has this on my EVO 4G and it was great until one day it crashed and erased ALL of my progress.  I was pretty far into the game.  Downloaded it to my Transformer, it loaded up ONCE and since then it shows the hourglass then quits.  Even after the firmware update and everything, its the GAME itself that's borked.  I'm so glad I got this upon its release when it was free as I'd be ticked if I paid for this garbage.  ZERO STARS.  It doesn't even deserve one!
B004YF6MHW|5.0|Awesome app. Makes virtually any built-in Android camera into a top-notch digital 12mp soap. Just one less thing I have to carry around with me now. Tons of options, filters and effects, not to mentions all the free add-ons.
B005K17RU0|5.0|unlike other reviews of this app, I had no problems with this.  It is accurate, colorful, and easily installed on kindle fire.  Perhaps they fixed the bugs but at any rate, it works great.

0321811984|5.0|Great book. Very easy to read and with many insights in the presentation world. Highly recommended.<br />I want to add that this was the first time when I ordered on Amazon and I was very pleased by the readiness. Great job guys!
B005ZUR724|1.0|really not a bad game for the kindle fire, but when i turn the game on it checks for updates and then the game crashes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just that, I loved it. I stayed up too late many nights, dying to know what happens next! This is an unexpected and riveting book.  Again LOVED IT!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|How can you argue with a classic? This is my favorite of all Jane Austen's books; I think I've seen just about every film adaptation of it ever made. To have it in a kindle format is nice for a change, though the formatting is a little...odd. I think I prefer the paper format.
B0000019PA|5.0|I picked this up when it was first released and it haunts me to this day. This is not pretty music, but it is beautiful. And maybe a little disturbing too. The instrumentation includes singing saws, horns, but there's the singer-songwriter acoustic mode at the core. Its different and unusual and moving. Honestly, if music for you is something to just brighten a sunny day, this probably isn't for you. This music seeps into your soul. I still don't understand the lyrics entirely (who is the king of carrot flowers?), but certain songs bring tears to my eyes. I always come away feeling as though I've experienced something that changed my life. If music has been something to brighten your sunny day, but you're interested to know what else music can be and do...you should hear this album.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I happen to be a big fan of Adele and I listen to her all the time. This was a special treat to see her concert, excellent, the music was great and it was great to see her do her magic. I would recomment this to anyone.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|Watched 3 times and cried all 3...mystery supreme...amazing that these good English male actors are filling the void made apparent by the repetitious replay of only progressive, socialist American actors. Loved the movie.  Danial Craig is spectacular and so is his family...more than just a ghosting...much more. 10 stars.

B0044DE906|1.0|Do not waste your time ,your money or your self respect.<br /><br />I found the characters empty,the plot non existent, the writing basic,the settings stifling.<br /><br />I would place it in the Mills & Boone genre and not grant it even one star. {It seems the<br /><br />website enforces a minimum ranking of one star.]

B006M7JCC2|5.0|It took me a few hours to finish this book, wow, truly gripping.  Anita Moorjani's descriptive writing ability takes the reader into her journey, and brought tears to this readers' eyes. I cried when she explained the steps about her body's suffering as it broke down slowly to its eighty pound frame.  I wanted to reach in and take her pain away as her body broke down completely and she couldn't fight for it anymore.  I wanted to be there, and I was as I read on.  I was there for those moments that I held that book.<br /><br />Such writing allows us to experience if just for a moment another human beings' life, and I have been most fortunate to have now experienced Anita in such form.<br /><br />I can certainly relate to Anita's experience following her death from cancer. I died from a drowning experience over forty years ago.  She is a true inspiration to us all.<br /><br />The clarity of death is far beyond our current life experience, as we see many truths from so many diverse perspectives.  Anita brings that to light in such a simplistic way, that even the experience of no time or time all at once is conveyed to understanding. She also beautifully relays the horror of dying, but the magnificense of what we are, what we all are and will continue to be infinitely.<br /><br />Bravo! Onward fearlessly as these probabilities and into what is yet to be.<br /><br />Ice cream and the ocean, what a perfect combination! :)

159514188X|5.0|The book Thirteen Reasons Why written by Jay Asher is a book about the last days of a girl named Hanna Baker's life. She committed suicide, a way no teen should die. Instead of a note to explain her irrational decision to end her life she makes seven cassettes tapes, one reason on each side except for the last tape which only has one side. A week before Hanna sent out the tapes to the 13 people that she felt caused her to end her life she slips maps displaying points of interest or places that the recipients of the tapes should visit. Places like Monets Café or Rosie's Diner where something tragic may have happened or where a person may live that are mentioned in the tapes. Hanna encourages her listeners to visit theses places to better put themselves in her shoes. This story is told from the point of view of Clay, a boy who receives the tapes from a previous listener and is required to send the tapes to the next person mentioned after him on the tapes. I found this book an emotional rollercoaster but I still enjoyed it. I found it to paint a true picture of teenage life as it touched topics that some authors and people try to avoid but are now more than ever relevant in our society. Between rumors and betrayal, theft and invasion, trust and love; all these factors affect everyone in a different way.  In Hanna's case it affected her so much that she thought her only option was death. After reading the book I will try to be more careful about how I treat people because you can never truly know how your actions will affect others. I recommend this book for everyone of any age.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Purchased this entire Harry Potter movie collection as a Christmas gift for my husband. He & our 8 year old daughter enjoyed watching the entire set! Great deal for a great series!!
0439023513|1.0|I enjoyed The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  But Mockingjay was a complete disappointment.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />After Finnick's major role in CF, I was disappointed that Collins killed him off so quickly.  Peeta's behavior due to his \\"hijacking\\" was overwrought and completely unbelievable.  Collins should have done more research.  Haymitch's relegation to a very minor role was a major loss.  And as the book progressed, Katniss became less and less a hero and more and more unbearable!  Her murder of President Coin lacked coherent justification.  It may have made sense to Katniss, but there wasn't enough evidence presented in the book to warrant the act.<br /><br />I thank Suzanne Collins for reminding me why Young Adult fiction should not be read by anyone other than Young Adults.

1932907009|5.0|Having read Save the Cat, I reviewed a full length screenplay I had been working on and, lo and behold when I applied some of the techniques to my screenplay it immediately opened up avenues for revision that made immense improvements in the script.

I can wholeheartedly recommend this book without reservations.<br />Warren Graffeo

0375704027|5.0|This book has nothing to do with Norway or woods.  Well, maybe with the woods, setting-wise.  It does, however, mention the Beatles song a couple of times.  (Okay, that's a lame opener.)<br /><br />Japanese author Haruki Murakami is known for his complex and surreal style of writing, tackling rather heavy societal issues in his fiction writing. His characters feel grounded and relatable.  His themes are, at times, controversial, yet people respond to them.<br /><br />Norwegian Wood is a coming-of-age story of Toru Watanabe, a young man in the 1960s-70s.  Toru narrates his story in first person struggling with his friends, school, and love life; dealing with suicide, relationships, and his own personal issues.  His best friend, Kizuki commits suicide and this event heavily affects Toru and the people around him.  He shares this world with Naoko, Kizuki's girlfriend, whom he is sort of in love with also.  Naoko never really recovers and goes into depression. Through the years, their lives are touched by more people: Midori, Toru's friend from school; Reiko, Naoko's roommate; and other colorful characters.<br /><br />The Beatles song that shares the same name as the novel describes Toru and Naoko's relationship: \\"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...\\"  They have a very complicated - and for one time, sexual - relationship.  Did they or did they not love each other?<br /><br />Reading this book is like being transported to an other-wordly, ethereal place as if you are in somewhere magical.  His writing is just so beautiful and poetic, the words flow nicely on the page.  Toru reminds me of Daria.  He just goes with what life throws at him.  He doesn't think he's any special and he knows that he's flawed and accepts it.  The subject of suicide is heavily featured in this book.  In the news, I have read Japanese and Korean and other Asian young people committing suicide.  Some of them are famous actors and models.  Even though this was first published in the late 80s, it clearly is still relevant today.<br /><br />Kudos also to translator Jay Rubin who managed to maintain the integrity and intensity of the work.  Being bilingual myself, I know that are are some words in my language that have no exact translation in English.  The way he weaved the words set up a crystal clear atmosphere while maintaining the mood that Murakami's works are famous for.<br /><br />Overall, it is a tale of growing up.  A lyrical piece of fiction that captures the reader and does not let go.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: Lovely imagery, deep emotions, and exceptional writing.  I wish everyone would read this book.he late 80s, it clearly is still relevant today.<br /><br />Kudos also to translator Jay Rubin who managed to maintain the integrity and intensity of the work.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|My family watched 'Porco Rosso' again last night.  All three of us--my husband, my young adolescent daughter, and myself--love 'Porco Rosso', and there are very few films this can be said of as our tastes are divergent.  I spent some time reading the reviews, and want to add my own opinion.<br />'Porco Rosso' is a marvel. It's a very funny movie, a thrilling adventure, and it is so visually beautiful that it's painful.  By now I've seen 'Porco Rosso' perhaps four times, all in the last year, and have had time to familiarize myself with the film's pacing, characterizations, and plot:  they all satisfy me.  The setting in late Twenties Italy and the Adriatic is particularly interesting as we live in Italy.  My husband was born in Milan in the Thirties and grew up there, and he recognized in the movie that area of Milan where  Piccolo's factory is located, expressing considerable nostalgia for the milanese canals--\\"navigli\\"--which are now all flowing underground covered with concrete and asphalt.<br />I consider this a fit movie for children in spite of the language--\\"jerk\\", \\"moron\\"--tossed around; part of the smoking, drinking, womanizing Porco Rosso's character, and the basis of the plot, is that he ISN'T a role model, but rather the opposite.  The females in the film are great, starting with the opening sequence in which a group of irrepressible little girls on a class outing are kidnapped for ransom by the unfortunate pirates.  One comes away from Miyazaki's films feeling better about being a woman, and more hopeful for the future of one's daughter.<br />This film gets my highest recommendation.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Straight forward, simple game of solitaire. No frills, no thrills. There are ads but I don't notice them and I play at least once a day. After a day of writing, researching, etc. this is a nice brainless game.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|I will have to disagree with the many one-star reviewers who say this movie delves too much into Hoover's private sexual lives.  It does not.  What it does seem to emphasize is how weird he was, how a momma's boy who never married had an obsession with everyone else's sexual orientation because he himself was confused of his own.<br /><br />This movie shows the personal side of Hoover.  The movie spares any naked scenes between J Edgar Hoover and his long-time confidante Clyde Tolson; the closest is reveals is a fight scene at 1:34 hours and a few hand-holding seconds. For the remainder of the movie the focus is on Hoover's quirky obsessions with Martin Luther King Jr, the Kennedys, and the personal relationship between Hoover and Tolson that seemed to crumble in its later years.  It also shows how Hoover often falsified or exaggerated reports to make him seem like the nation's perfect crime fighter when in fact others did that job for him.<br /><br />The acting is fine by all the starring casts.  DiCaprio does an outstanding job and so does Naomi Watts as his personal secretary Helen Gandy.  Armie Hammer rounds out the main characters as Clyde Tolson.<br /><br />What I did find distracting is the director's constant going back and forth between the young and the old Hoover.  Director Clint Eastwood also seems to have a preference of using side lighting that makes the other half of a person's face disappear into deep shadows, something he also used in \\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" with piano music accompanying the somber scenes.<br /><br />The movie flows at times as if Hoover is dictating his life to his personally-appointed biographer.  The make-up on \\"Tolson\\" also makes him look like a corpse, whereas Hoover himself is aged well.<br /><br />There is emphasis on the botched Lindbergh kidnapping case, obsession with the Roosevelts (both Franklin and Eleanor) and later MLK.  Not enough was devoted to Hoover's dealings with the mafia of the 1930s, and nothing is mentioned about the FBI files of Vietnam War protesters.<br /><br />So, watch this with the above caveats.  This movie shows more of the personal side of Hoover and touches only on the many bizarre and above-the-law tactics Hoover employed to gather information on anyone he seemed treasonous against America.  Presidents both feared and admired him, and that is evident in the alleged quote Nixon said upon learning of Hoover's death, a quote I can't post here because Amazon will refuse to post my review.bout the FBI files of Vietnam War protesters.<br /><br />So, watch this with the above caveats.

I am a bit sad that you have to run their software on any box you want to connect to, but that life. It is also very disappointing that this software is so much of a resource hog that it can nearly bring down my server even when the only thing running is IE.<br /><br />As long as I don't ask too much of the software like looking at documents, it is fine. But ask it to play solitaire is out of the question.

B001EC3JME|5.0|I have been using this holster for over five years now on a regular basis and its great. It twists to point any of the eight direction you want and it clips very securely onto your belt \\"it will not accidentally fall off and get lost\\". I made an elastic headband out of some pants suspenders that I got from the thrift store for a couple bucks and put this holster on the wide and thick belt sized elastic and made it into a headlight holster and it works perfectly.<br /><br />I have been using my larger X2 Inova flashlight and it worked well, but the light is big so it flopped around when I turned my head, so I got the small X1 Inova flashlight and it fits in perfectly as well, but it doesn't fit in the main compartment, you have to push it in behind the main compartment where big flashlights can't fit but skinny smaller flashlights fit in perfectly and the smaller flashlight doesn't flop around with your head movement because its so lite weight.<br /><br />I also put my Fenix E11 in that smaller compartment and it holds perfectly as well. Then you can turn the holster any of the eight directions that the holster clicks into that you want.<br /><br />Update<br />I now have went on to use the zebralight H600 headlight and it has replaced every light that I own. It takes panasonic orbtronic 18650 lithium rechargeable batteries. It has a great run time of 2 hours on high which is 1020 lumens and on medium and low the run times just drastically improve.<br />They're super bright lights.<br />Check them out on youtube: Zebralight H602w and H600w MKII beamshot
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|Dvds were in baggies and looked like they had been bootlegged. Therefore, the quality of the screen was horrible. Also the packaging was cheesy. It was a terrible experience.
B004SRWW0C|4.0|A pretty nice app overall, but I docked it one star because it doesn't show directory sizes. You can long-press on a directory, choose Properties and it'll calculate the size, but that's a hassle and frankly this is a basic feature that anyone would expect to find.
0385736002|4.0|I picked this up at my son's book fair thinking that it would be a fun read given his interests in chemistry and history.  I turned out to be the one who got hooked.  While the writing itself is basic the story is engaging and fun.  I find myself wanting to return to it to see how the last cliffhanger resolves itself.  It's an engaging book that can appeal across a variety of ages.  I'm looking forward to the sequels.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I needed a headset as to not disturb others when I game but I wasn't willing to spend $50+. When I saw the price I was pretty skeptical but figured that thanks to the return policy if I didn't like them I'd just send them back. I ended up being very surprised by the quality for the price. Granted they aren't audiophile quality, but compared to other headphones in this price range, these blow the competition out of the water. Save yourself 20-25 bucks and buy these instead. The built in volume control is a nice convenience when you quickly need to mute the sound or turn it up. The mic is sensitive enough to not have to pull out in most cases so there isn't anything sticking out, it's not so sensitive that background noise will be picked up either (for the most part, a lot of this is determined more by user settings after all).

B005FITIK0|3.0|Charlize does a great job at the character she plays in this black comedy. The ending is the problem. It's like the writers didn't finish the story so they just threw random events together for this half-assed ending.

B002OSXDAU|5.0|Whether you agree or disagree with Ayn Rand's politics is not the issue. Her enthusiasm, her intelligence and zeal kept me interested into turning to the next page. A fast paced read with focus on making a point in the end.<br /><br />Two soliloquies in The Fountainhead kept me riveted with interest, absorbed in the thought processes of her mind. The first was from the villain  of the story, Toohey who embodied all our author hated in a man. Toohey addressed one of his \\"puppets\\" and made him confront the truth he always knew but preferred to avoid. When you know the truth but deny it to make yourself seem better, it is an even worse sin. The last soliloquy was from our hero Rourke at the very end where he defends himself in court.<br /><br />Both men stood for very different morals. One for individuality while the other advocated crushing the individual for the benefit of the masses. Again whether you agree or disagree with Rand on one stand or the other, she expressed both sides of the coin with relish and with enthusiasm.<br /><br />An amazing writer, she kept me hooked form beginning to end. If you set aside political views and read the book as entertainment for its artistic value, you will derive enjoyment and pleasure from the fluidity of her style.<br /><br />One thing surprised me was her depiction of women. None of the women in this novel are admirable or people to be trusted. Even when she explained why one or the other did something, it seemed self serving and vengeful. I kept wondering if she hated women in general. I disliked all her female characters. Again, it was personal and did not deter from the story line, although it made me raise my eyebrows several times.<br /><br />I loved the book.

B002ZG98C8|4.0|I'm going to side with the Amazon review written by Paul Gaita. He pretty much nailed all of the key points on this one.<br /><br />The reasons you might want to watch this are:<br /><br />1). Robert Rodriguez. It's reasonably consistent with his other work, maybe better, maybe worse, but if you've enjoyed his other films, there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one.<br /><br />2). The \\"Nash Bridges\\" reunion no one requested. Don Johnson & Cheech Marin, co-stars of what was possibly one of the worst TV series of all time, are together on the same screen again. You knew Cheech would be here...Don was the curve ball.<br /><br />3). Steven Seagal! Playing a bad guy! A really really BAD bad guy! You're probably no longer reading my review at this point because Seagal's appearance in this film has enticed you into clicking the \\"buy\\" button.<br /><br />4). Danny Trejo. If I have to tell you who Danny is, you're considering the wrong purchase. Having him in the lead role is a major draw. Having him in the lead role in a Robert Rodriguez film is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You may not like it, but a million or so people will mercilessly ridicule you for feeling that way.<br /><br />5). Jessica Alba. Is the bad acting simply bad acting or part of the overall joke? She's gorgeous here...as always...but the acting?<br /><br />6). Lindsay Lohan as a semi-automatic weapon-toting woman in a nun's outfit. Err...huh?<br /><br />7). Robert DeNiro? See \\"Jessica Alba\\" above.<br /><br />As Steven Seagal said in the film, \\"Back the **** up and WATCH.\\"<br /><br />Four stars for over-the-top, uber-violent cinematic fun.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Loved Hunger Games and Catching Fire, but Mockingjay was a huge disappointment. This book shamefully reminds me of the Vietnam War.  The characters were wasted without pause for emotion, care or thought to the sacrifices made after Collins gave them a life and place in our hearts.  I thought perhaps humanity in the storyline would've evolved with more dignity to the human race and the effects of war. Especially, when so many young readers have flocked to this book series. A lost opportunity in this book.  Collins gives hope, compassion, acknowledgement and even thanks where there is oppression in the first two books, but it is all lost in the third. Collins has wasted her talent along with the characters here in Mockingjay. This story doesn't flow with the first two, and oh yeah the epilogue??? it felt like- an oh by the way...in passing...info about characters I only recognize by name- a bunch of empty words, no emotion or feelings.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|minus the bad acting from the college kids, this movie was surprisingly funny and well-written!<br />i loved every minute to see the hillbillies as the misunderstood good guys for once!<br /><br />great movie!
0439023491|5.0|I totally enjoyed the continuation of the \\"Hunger Games\\" book series. The way they portray what happens after the games and what Katniss, Peeta, Gale and their families go through because of what happened in the arena is well written and captivated my interest after every page turn. I wish there was more!! (am currently reading the third book).<br /><br />If it weren't for my friends I would never have picked these books up. I am so glad they recommended them to me!
B005IEGUDY|5.0|This is a book well worth reading if you are fascinated by Stonehenge and related legends.  I read this book about 20 years ago while taking an anthropology class, and was totally fascinated by the book.  Mr. Rutherford's writing style is superb.  He has the gift of making it seem as if you can see his characters and the world in which they live.  Though a very long book, I loved every minute I spent reading it.  I was only sorry when it was over.  I have since read other books by this author, like Russka, and found them to be just a good.  If you enjoy a good book that will actually take your mind away to live among the characters, this is the book for you.  Enjoy.<br /><br />Ann McJilton

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|i'm a very, very long time springsteen fan, since his jersey days in the 70's...so yes i'm old! i've seen him many times live through the years, including on my wedding night, and have every recorded song he has put out, plus tons of very old bootlegs. i say the above to give my brief comments some perspective.<br /><br />after listening to it a couple of times now, i'd characterize it as a nice listen, with some fun country undertones to it, but by no means would i put wrecking ball up against any of his best work..other than 'land of hopes and dreams' which imo is a classic springsteen song in any form...but even this is not the best version out there by far.<br /><br />so for long time springsteen fans this should be part of your collection, but imo it does not approach much of his earlier work in terms of depth or character.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Not only is the flick \\"one of a kind\\" like Roger Rabbit or Tron, it was a fun story. Not a movie like any other, having a BluRay version is just delicious icing on a scrumptious cake...just keeps getting better!<br /><br />P.S. I am most assuredly NOT an angst-ridden teenager, having passed 60 a while back. I just happen to have a life-long addiction to comix, movies, and adventure. Whatever the reason, i find myself enjoying movies others don't get, or can't watch (The Skin I Live In, etc.). This movie was a real good time for me, and I get why many others really liked watching it. Too bad for the left-out and clueless, sucks to be you. :)
B001DJ7PQ4|3.0|I purchased this used off of Amazon from a seller called \\"BDMarket\\". The actual show itself was incredible! Catherine Tate was definitely the right way to go, companion-wise. However, the copy I received was obviously a bootleg. The plastic back that holds the discs was held in with glue that was not working at all, The episode titles on the actual discs were misspelled, there was no proof of purchase tags on the inside flap, and the audio/video quality was much less than DVD quality.<br /><br />Doctor Who is, without a doubt, my favorite show and this season does not disappoint. However, be careful who you buy from!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So, the book is not the best written....<br /><br />Very few books are today.<br /><br />But, if you want to pick up a book and not put it down...  here you go.<br /><br />I bought the book Friday night, it is now Sunday afternoon, and I have read all 3.<br /><br />Sleep you ask?  No.<br /><br />So, yes, I am recommending this book if you have 3 days with no work or family obligations to attend to as you won't be able to put down the first, second or third book.<br /><br />Highly recommend to your friends, BUT DON'T TELL THEM THE PLOT.  BEST AS A SURPRISE.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This is a fascinating book in many ways - the coming of age story of a child who is utterly failed by our foster care system; the rediscovery of the intricate hidden messages sent via flowers in the Victorian era; the enchanting setting in the San Francisco bay area and the farms east of the bay.  As a result of her experiences in the system, the central character cannot form emotional attachments in a close or effective way - also a fascinating aspect of the book.<br /><br />However, I found many plot developments \\"too convenient\\" to be credible.  It's more like a made for TV movie plot than literature.  That said, it was fun to read and the writing (expression, development, etc.) was well done.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|This app wont down load on android.  There are no instructions and I am very disappointed.  Thought it would have been cool. Hope they really aren't going to  charge me!
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a really fun app.  Whatever you are interested in is easy to find and playing the station is a cinch.  The sound quality is pretty good.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|The action in the first movie was better. This one was new and entertaining but not edge of your seat thrilling.
1594203334|5.0|I love anthropology and the study of cultures. Although I don't have children yet I was so fascinated by the in depth look at French culture in regards to raising children. It was such unique valuable information that only an insider would know, I really appreciate Pamela Druckerman for sharing it with us! I felt such hope reading this book that I can have a child and still have a life with my husband, be able to go out to eat and have my baby sleep through the night. My favorite part was reading how the 2 year olds in the 'creche' get a four course lunch every day and they happily eat it...brilliant!<br />Thank you Pamela!
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I think the hype before the movie set my expectations higher than they should have been. This movie is Speilburg's version renewed of E.T. and a less threatening isolated version of alien invasion from a military controlled Area 51 escape. The child imagination will enjoy this one but the adult imagination will stop believing the events are possible by the end of the movie.
0307887960|5.0|After doing this diet, I have read both really positive and really negative reviews of it. My opinion is that every diet has its positives and criticisms. Every diet (kind of like every product you ever read reviews about) has people who love it and people who hate it and would tell you to stay as far away from it as possible. All I can say is that this diet has worked for my husband and myself. Maybe it depends on each individual as to how it makes you feel and so forth. Every weight loss diet has some sort of extreme change, and though there may be criticisms of it, I figured that trying a diet would be better than staying overweight and eating as I was. Some people need a structured way of doing it rather than just \\"cutting back and exercising more\\". From August to December, I lost a little over 30 pounds and my husband lost a little over 60 pounds. We were strict with it though the occasional get-together did make us eat a few things we shouldn't have for just that meal. We saw that we didn't lose the weight that day and started back the next. I think a key thing was to drink the water required every day. I noticed that I lost more on the protein days when I drank the required amount of water and did the exercise. I've read some pretty harsh reviews and can only say that this has worked for us. I was even told by a trainer at a gym that I looked very healthy as I was losing the weight. That was a huge boost. We are now getting some of the regular foods back into our diet but being careful not to just allow everything back in just yet. It made sense that your body needs the time to adjust to your new weight because it will fight to get back to what it's used to. I think that's one reason why you feel pretty sluggish the first few days of the diet (apart from the energy from carbs being taken away). Your body is being deprived of what it's used to and it's trying to hold on to what it can. I liked that even though you were limited on what you could eat, you were not limited on how much you could eat. With such a busy schedule, it was so much easier to stock the fridge with allowable foods and get what you want when you want. People need to find what works for them and different people do better on different diets. Looking back, I wish that I had kept a journal during the weight loss as well as a log of the weight loss to look back and see the process. For me, this was a doable diet in which I got results and I'm feeling healthier and happier.
B002O320TA|4.0|It was a little strange to have Rowan Atkinson talk cause I was used to the quiet Mr. Bean.It has great action like James Bonde and humor like Maxwell Smart.It could've had a PG-13 rating because of nudity though.It's 5 times better then Mr.Bean.Get it if you love spy movies.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|its the same game found on the pc but there are issues on my device the samsung galaxy player 4.0. the game freezes often and crashes.
1594203334|5.0|I loved this book. I already use many of these parenting techniques with my own bebe (before even reading this book) because they seemed like common sense to me. They work every time. My girl was \\"doing her nights\\" at 2 1/2 months. She is now 6 months old and she sleeps 12 hours a night before waking up, and she naps 3 or 4 times a day. Even when I used to babysit other people's kids I used many of these techniques, especially \\"the big eyes\\". I have always firmly believed in the cadre, and also that kids will eat foods that they are introduced to, if parents go about it the right way. I also believe that America has been taken over by enfant rois that need to be coddled and told how amazing they are for the most mediocre achievements, and they end up never doing anything with their lives that is worthwhile.<br /><br />Aside from the parenting techniques to teach children how to be sage, I also found helpful the parts about how almost guilt-free the moms are. I have found myself feeling guilty about a lot of things, especially the things that are beyond my control. Now I realize that I don't have to feel guilty for needing time apart from my little one, because she probably needs time apart from me too! And I don't have to feel guilty about wanting to combine my roles as wife, mother, and worker into one whole person: a woman with needs and feelings. I like that the French believe that children should learn their place in the home, and that its not all about them all the time. I think this teaches children responsibility and empathy for others.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />I am editing my review to include some info now that my bebe is almost 18 months old. I've since read Karen Lebillion's book, French Kids Eat Everything and started using that to help me teach my daughter to appreciate meals and foods. So far everything is going great and I regret nothing. I only wish that these books had been available when I was pregnant since I didn't get to read them until my bebe was an infant and I had less time to read each day. For these books, I MADE the time. Even if it meant less sleep at night.<br /><br />My personal parenting style includes some Attachment Parenting ideals, and a lot of what is in BUB and FKEE. It is working for me and my family and we are happy. My husband is happy to have a sweet and cheerful toddler who is a joy to be around. I am happy to feel good about being woman with a family, not just a mom and a wife. My daughter is happy because she gets the attention she needs and deserves, the sleep and nutrition she requires, and is learning and enjoying life in all its lovely variety.<br /><br />Here's how things have changed since my initial review:<br /><br />Implementing a \\"French\\" parenting style is much different with a toddler than it is with an infant. Its harder because sometimes during tantrums you just want to give in and let them have whatever they want, especially if you are in a public place and getting nasty looks. But 99% of the time I am able to stay strong. I remind myself that when she is throwing a fit, she may want a snack or a new toy. But what she needs is to learn patience and good manners. If I don't teach her, how will she learn? If she doesn't learn by practice, then how?<br /><br />I won't say my daughter is the best behaved child of all time. She goes to a daycare which is a lot like a creche in some ways, but that is where the similarities end. There is only one teacher per 7-8 children. Not nearly enough to prevent all the biting, hitting, kicking, etc that goes on among toddlers. My daughter has learned some pretty awful words and aggressive behaviors from other kids that she would never have learned in our home. This is natural and would have happened eventually once she reached school age, but I was not ready for this from a toddler. Luckily at home we are able to stop these behaviors quickly.<br /><br />She has a lot of toys, thanks to her relatives. She doesn't play with mostof them because she prefers \\"real\\" things and we believe in unstructured play. She uses her toys in creative ways I would never have thought of. We try to only give her toys which will encourage creativity. We also like to take her places that she can explore on her own. Out to fields, to museums, parks, nature paths, etc. Not just places that are themed for children. We like to just let her play on her own as much as she wants. When she wants us to play with her she comes to us and asks, but we stay out of her way until she asks us to join her. Her favorite thing to do is read. She likes us to read to her and she also likes to \\"read\\" to her animals and dolls. She basically turns the pages and babbles and points to the pictures. Thanks to teaching her to be patient she is happy to sit still and read several books at one time. Her favorite book is almost 70 pages long. She also likes to \\"give speeches\\" where she lines up her toys and she stands in front of them and talks to them and gestures wildly like she's giving a passionate speech about something super important. I have no idea where she learned that. Her pediatrician says her vocabulary, behaviors, and level of self control is far beyond her age group. I don't know how much of that is due to my parenting or what but I'm proud.<br /><br />As a result of using BUB and FKEE to drastically alter our eating habits, my daughter eats a ton of different foods that most of the kids I know would gag on. Her favorite foods include black olives and raw broccoli. She also is more well behaved in restaurants than she is at home. She sits and waits for her food, and she at least tries everything on her plate. She doesn't always eat everything but she doesn't throw her food (anymore...) and she doesn't have fits at the table. She sits still and talks to me and her dad while we finish eating and pay. At home she gets a little restless since she knows her toys are in another room and she wants to get up from the table and go play instead of waiting for me and my husband to finish eating. She hasn't learned to politely excuse herself from the meal yet, so until she does we make her sit with us until everyone has finished.<br /><br />We get compliments all the time from people in public who see her on her best behavior. Some of her first words were please and thank you. She is friendly and says hello and goodbye to everyone we meet. She says thank you to anyone who gives her anything and rarely has to be reminded to say please. She usually does not freak out in public unless I've kept her out too long and she's tired or hungry. I can pretty much take her anywhere with me without any problems.<br /><br />BUB is perfect for me because I don't believe in spanking. I don't think there is any reason to spank ever. I give my child the tools she needs to learn to behave herself. Spanking teaches nothing except to do what the parent says in order to not get spankings. I want to teach her to have good manners and follow instructions because its the right thing to do. I feel that I have the ability to teach her right from wrong, and the reasons why she should behave a certain way. I feel that she is intelligent enough to understand these concepts. Spanking her would represent a lack of confidence in my ability to teach her and in her ability to learn. With the things I've learned in BUB, I won't ever feel like I need to spank her. I do believe in short time outs and in taking away privileges and things, because those are real consequences and they have meanings behind them. Spanking is just senseless violence and teaches nothing but more violence in the place of knowledge. So far we've never spanked and we don't think she is old enough for time out, and we also haven't needed it. She knows what's allowed and what's not. Toys that are kicked, thrown, or otherwise abused are temporarily taken away. Food that is thrown is taken away. When crayons are used to color things that are not paper, they are taken away. When she demonstrates the ability to follow rules and control herself again, she has earned back whatever was taken away. So simple, easy, and effective.<br /><br />Our relatives thought I was nuts in the beginning, but now after having seen the effects BUB and FKEE have had on our family they are recommending them to everyone with kids.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this book and how its impacted us.ay instead of waiting for me and my husband to finish eating.

B006PGL7OQ|1.0|...go there immediately immediately after you decide to watch this movie. Doing so will save you from a disastrous movie, which features fifteen minutes worth of story drawn out over two agonizing hours. Have a nap instead, and enjoy the time you spent doing something constructive instead of soaking up this little train wreck.<br /><br />Don't worry: no spoilers are revealed in the following discussion of this movie's events, because the outcome is utterly ambiguous. This is not the kind of ambiguity that gets you talking about the movie, talking about the ending or talking about the characters. Instead it's the kind of ambiguity that forces you do to the sad calculations about all the other things you might have done with your time had you not been watching this.<br /><br />Blue-collar Ohio resident Curtis has a decent job, a nice enough house, a pretty red-haired wife, a special needs (hearing-impaired) daughter...and a dog. Oh yeah: he's also got a mom who was diagnosed and institutionalized with paranoid schizophrenia at the same age Curtis is now.<br /><br />In the months after his father's death (an event whose significance is pointed out, but is a big red herring...along with bizarre visits to his mother and from his brother), Curtis starts having bad dreams, daytime hallucinations and paralyzing panic attacks. In response, first he makes dog live outside, and then decides he MUST upgrade his existing storm shelter...by adding a 40-foot ISO shipping container. After wetting the bed during one dream, he goes to see his doctor (who is oh-so-coincidentally familiar with his mom's case) to discuss his symptoms. And even though it's not too hard for him to arrange a $6000 home improvement loan and wrangle company equipment to bury the shipping container in his back yard, it is WAY too hard for him to make the two hour drive to Columbus to see the psychiatrist his warm and fuzzy family doctor recommends...until way too late in the unraveling of his life.<br /><br />Oh yeah: we also learn his employer's generous health plan will pay for implants needed to restore his daughter's hearing...and it will only take six weeks to get the surgery scheduled! Director Jeff Nichols should have just put up a big flashing neon said that said: \\"Curtis is about to get fired, lose his insurance and really agitate his wife.\\" Of course he does get fired (for using the company equipment at home), and from here the movie proceeds into its climax and denouement, when Curtis has an epic meltdown at a Lions' Club dinner, followed by a midwest weather event that places the whole family first in the shelter and then at the beach to confront his --and their-- fears about actual and metaphoric storms.<br /><br />Here's the thing: most of the characters are likeable enough and the acting is good enough that this movie could have been turned into an engaging story about something...if it could have ever figured out what that something is. This movie is part Twilight Zone episode, part pick-any-M. Night Shyamalan \\"thriller\\", part \\"Whose Eating Gilbert Grape\\"...but not the right parts of any of them. And while I can accept an ambiguous ending, I can't accept a movie that is at least 30 minutes longer than it needs to be through pacing that is deliberately glacial. The time is not filled with engaging dialog or revealing actions, but with long views of stuff and people who often aren't doing anything at all.>Oh yeah: we also learn his employer's generous health plan will pay for implants needed to restore his daughter's hearing...and it will only take six weeks to get the surgery scheduled!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|When I ordered my Kindle Fire I ordered this cover mainly because of the look & most of all the price. When i received my items I was a little disappointed at first with the cover. When i try to use it to stand the Fire up I didn't think was a enough of a groove to hold it. Before I sent it back I ordered another one. When I received it and switch covers. My 14 year old son has been using my kindle more then i have and he had it at the time and said he liked the original cover better. He said it was lighter & less bulky then the new one. When I took the Fire and tried it I did notice what he was saying. So I sent the new one back and kept the original one which this review is about.<br /><br />This cover is lightweight, and thin. Hold the Kindle Fire in nicely with corner clip like pieces. It fits nice and snug I don't ever worry about it coming out. The cover is nice and thin with a felt inside and a strap to hold the cover closed. I am very please with the cover and the cost of the cover. One of my friends from work saw it and was really pleased with it and ordered one for herself. I highly recommend it. The groove to hold the cover so the Kindle can stand up is just right after all and I won't be looking for any other covers.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Oliver Stone isn't getting any younger, but his government still wants him.  In fact, everyone from the President himself to the FBI, to NCA, to the M16 (yes you read that right), want him.<br /><br />The book starts off with Stone being ushered to meet with the President, who gives him an undercover assignment to fly to Mexico to deal with Russian drug lords.  But the trip never comes to fruition.  After the meeting, Stone is walking through LaFayette Park and finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Gunfire pelts the park with bullets and an explosion lands him in the hospital for a bit.<br /><br />Baldacci took a relatively simple incident and blossomed it into a full-length novel full of twists and turns.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of back-tracking of clues, including repeated visits to the site of the explosion as if Stone expected the answers to appear in front of him.  And of course, most times he and his \\"side kick\\", the M16 agent, find something or \\"see\\" something they hadn't before.<br /><br />Oliver Stone mentions in a passage that he is getting older and that he wouldn't be the head of the Camel Club forever.  Is Baldacci dropping a clue to his readers not to worry about Stone's aging and a potential end to the series?<br /><br />As for one small nit, the overuse of the term \\"nodded\\" became very apparent, and I would have expected better from an author of Baldacci's calibre.<br /><br />With all considered it was a good read even if not the best Camel Club book to date.  However, I will still look forward to the next.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this app is pretty great.  but when ur city gets larger, it takes longer for the game to load.  but other than that its pretty good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very challanging and hard to put down. Now if they came up with a game called \\"Angry Zombies\\" that would be priceless.

B004LROUNG|1.0|I've read, over the years, most of John Grisham's novels....if not all of them. I found this one, \\"The Litigators\\", not of the high quality one would expect of John Grisham. I hope his next novel is of a much higher standard.

B004UXUX4Q|2.0|This is a serious ambitious movie about relationships--husbands and wives, parents and children, peers-- and it deserves credit for the attempt. It also has pathos and wit. Its themes is seemingly unconditional forgiveness and tolerance but that seems at times unreal and sentimental. The extended deathbed scenes also get too close to schmalz at times. There is also the irrelevant Sierra club type of stupid decision NOT to develop a choice piece of real estate.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|I remember listening to \\"Fallen\\" when it came out and loving it. The band showed incredible potential and Amy Lee had an amazing/beautiful voice. I recently decided to get their 2nd album after all these years because I wanted to hear what I may have missed out on (i heard that the band had gone through a lot of member changes and that the co-founding member wasn't on this album etc etc).<br /><br />So when I popped this in, I was literally blown away. Evanescence had improved in almost every way since \\"Fallen\\". Amy Lee's vocals are still top notch, her lyrics are deeper and evoke emotion more, the lead guitars are great in the mix, and the songwriting in general feels like the right direction for the band.<br /><br />What makes this album so special is that it not only improves upon everything, it experiments upon the band's sound. Some songs are more atmospheric, some are in your face rock, some are stripped down ballads, almost half incorporate strings, and some also incorporate beats and experimentation similar to Bjork.<br /><br />\\"The Open Door\\" is actually better than \\"Fallen\\" in my eyes because it progresses to a level of songwriting and musical growth that is just extremely impressive. Anyone who passes this album up because of band member changes etc., is depriving themselves of an album that they would most likely adore.<br /><br />For fans of Evanescence and Amy Lee, this has to be in your album collection.<br /><br />For people new to Evanescence, I still recommend it but I also think that starting at \\"Fallen\\" and seeing the contrast is pretty mindblowing (\\"Fallen\\" is still a really good album).<br /><br />hope that helps
B006OAB3ME|1.0|a dreadful album....i bought this on the strength of some positive reviews from some bum amazon reviewers.its a sad reflection of someone who is desperate for the limelight.im talking about the artist and the reviewers.heres a tip..look at the resale price from independent sellers both new and used.there you go.i could write a bunch of songs about bottoms and it would sell better than this.

B006IDG2T6|5.0|Having observed over many years the counter-productive actions of many otherwise smart and able people, I have long doubted the existence of an essentially free will, and I am overjoyed to now own this interesting and cogent Kindle book that confirms my suspicions and explains why it's all just an illusion.<br /><br />Paradoxically, we can all become much freer when we recognize the compelling illusion of free choice and why the illusion exists, and this seems just the work that can help us do that. Probably of more practical value to the happiness of most of us than a bookcase full of prime non-fiction works!
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|This set comes with five minifigures, Batman, Robin, Joker, Harley Quinn, and Riddler. I love this set, but I have to ponder something: why is riddler here? But otherwise, this set is completely accurate to the personalitys, and roles of each minifigure.

0811729117|4.0|I have read many books about the Waffen SS and Wehrmacht, and 'Tigers in the Mud' is certainly very good - insofar as content and storytelling goes.  But the translation seems tedious and uses many expressions that are obviously literally translated without the effort of smoothing the narration into colloquial American English.  Almost all such books are translated from the original German (or sometimes French), but I don't remember ever encountering a publication as \\"tedious\\" or \\"clumsy\\" as this one.<br /><br />I am fairly fluent in German and can imagine what many of the expressions would have been in the original text, but can also imagine how they would have been better expressed for the American reader.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a great resource for the panzer afficionado.  Some good pictures also.

B006ZEDZNY|3.0|\\"Rum Diary\\" is not your typical Depp movie, and the trailers really don't portray it well.  Unfortunately, the same can be said for the movie with respect to any kind of story.  It's OK to watch as a movie for entertainment; the characters are entertaining enough, the scenery is attractive, and the scenes are reasonably well presented.  However, the plot is - to put it kindly - incoherent, occasionally derivative (see: Fiction, Pulp), and doesn't progress to anywhere meaningful.  Worth a $2 rental to watch if you don't expect to learn the meaning of life - or anything else, for that matter.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I absolutely love this app. I use it all the time. When I'm bored I get on fb and this definatley awesome
0307949486|3.0|Let me start by giving a bit of a disclaimer: I rarely read fiction, at least contemporary fiction. Modern fiction tends to be very formulaic within its specific genre, and there are simply too many mediocre novels out there to sort through. After hearing the great notices though, I elected to make an exception for \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" Stieg Larsson's blockbuster bestseller set in small town Sweden. I had read over and over what a page turner the book was, but I have to admit despite Larsson's obvious talent, the book is slow, particularly the first 200 pages or so. I don't know whether translation issues were major factors here, but the book clearly assumes some understanding of Swedish culture, and some names and terms quickly became confusing and distracting. The first (but not only) prominent example is the use of the word \\"gaol.\\" It is clearly a jail of some sort, but does it have a specialized meaning as a certain type of institution? If so it should be translated better, if not it should be translated as \\"jail,\\" which is how my dictionary simply defined it.<br /><br />While the pacing is often ponderous, it really seemed to need editing. An astonishing amount of minutiae is included in the book, and much could have been excised to make the book move faster and flow better. Sometimes authors skillfully draw out intertwined plot elements to heighten suspense, and while Larsson does that to some extent later in the book, much of the text reads as simple trivia that's more in the way of the plot than complementing it. The story concerns Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist convicted of libel and his unlikely alliance with the emotionally bankrupt and antisocial Lisbeth Salander, the tattooed girl of the title. The book is in large part a character study: unfortunately I found the character of Lisbeth to be more interesting but far less detailed than Mikael. Lisbeth has a credibility-straining gift with computers but no ability for normal human interactions, while Mikael came across as needlessly promiscuous, unlikeable, and cold, making this a book with characters that were somewhat interesting, but that I couldn't really care about. I found some of the plot elements utterly predictable and wooden. It was, for instance, a given that the two leads would eventually have a romantic relationship, yet it when it finally happens it's as ugly, impersonal, and forced as you could imagine.<br /><br />Other plot elements bothered me: it's not impossible to hire a disgraced reporter to undertake a cold case investigation from 1966, but is that really a more reasonable choice than hiring an actual detective with law enforcement experience? The novel depends on your thinking so. That this pursuit takes the book into very unseemly dark regions of the human psyche is beyond doubt, and I found some of the details needlessly gruesome. (I particularly dislike violence directed toward children or animals.) The book is unfocused in the sense that it has both the murder investigation and evil corporation plots working around each other, and they are not as complimentary as I expected them to be. In this case the homicide is much more gripping material, while the corporate villainy angle simply serves as a distracting background to provide motivation to the characters.<br /><br />In the end, the book is a modest example of contemporary fiction, though substantially less satisfying than I expected. There is no question that Larsson was a very smart writer with a good grasp of character and general plot outline, but the extraordinary amount of exposition about trivialities, the extremely trying religious components, and the forced feeling associated with the confluence of Mikael and Lisbeth, made me frankly have a hard time caring much about the protagonists and their tribulations. The book is somewhat turgidly paced, but on balance is conceptually still at least average for contemporary popular fiction, though I didn't find it to be especially distinguished from thousands of other novels vying for your attention.o be especially distinguished from thousands of other novels vying for your attention.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was one of my favorite books ever. It was great, very detailed. Don't read it unless you have read the 1st one. This trilogy is my personal favorite! Enjoy it. The price was reasonable considering how great this book was!!
B003CRM6QO|2.0|&#34;Flash Gordon&#34; could have been a truly great fantasy. Its intentional campiness is an insult both to the audience and Alex Raymond.  Raymond was one of the great cartoonists -- which is rather an unkind, left-handed compliment, because his work approaches serious &#34;illustration&#34;. Considered objectively, the &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; storyline is absurd. But that doesn't justify camping it up for a &#34;modern&#34; (ie, stupid) audience. Had the producer, director, and writer taken the comic strip as a serious work of art, the film would have been a beautiful romantic fantasy. Instead, we have a pile of shlock that doesn't take itself seriously -- so why should we? (See my review of &#34;John Carter&#34;, a pulp-fiction film that treats its source material respectfully.)  There are compensations. Max von Sydow again shows why he is one of the world's great actors. Brian Blessed is the perfect Vultan, finding the right balance between broad humor and aggressive pompousness. (If you don't believe Blessed is a fine actor, see the 1989 &#34;Henry V&#34;.) And -- forgive me -- I have a terrible weakness for Biro (the late Ted Carroll), who's adorable. He gets a classic groaner -- when asked whether he's all right after being shot, he responds &#34;They just winged me&#34;.  Alex Ross -- a great comic-book artist in his own right -- should have known better than to deliver a ten-minute lecture on just how wonderful &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; is. All he does is reveal an apparent lack of knowledge of really /good/ movies (of any genre). &#34;Flash&#34; is trash, and its destruction would be no great loss.  The transfer -- presumably from a Todd-AO 35 composite negative -- is spectacular: razor-sharp, detailed, and kandy-kolored. I saw no visible dirt, specks, or scratches.

B005FMZX9Q|5.0|Ok, so let me tell you, when I got the watch, I was like, oh yeah, great, one more Invicta. But this watch is getting noticed. I have had many people asking me about it and taking note of it, they liked it.<br /><br />The watch has a whitish dial, and the controls are on the left side instead of the typical right side. The seconds hand is reddish. The strap is not sweaty and feels comfortable. I won't go on describing the size and material as it is exactly as shown in the various nice photos and specifications.<br /><br />Do not be impressed with the amount of discount shown on Invicta watches. Like a 700 dollar watch sold for 99 dollars. The watch is indeed a 99 dollar watch. If you have been using expensive watches, you shall immidiately feel the watch is of lower quality than those. So do not expect this to be a 300 dollar watch.<br /><br />But as I said, there is something about this watch, that just looks good. And that's the important thing! You get noticed! The watch stands out, it looks nicely engineered and designed, and its big in size, which I love. We won't go into the typical keeps time well, and how to adjust the time, chrono etc. Generally you buy these watches to look good, and yes, this one will look good on you, during a night party out, at work, at evening dinner, ladies will be happy, and co-workers ask about it.

B007BLCGNU|5.0|\\"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"  This movie is, I think, rather unfairly criticized by several Amazon reviews because it's an exercise in watching power corrupt and, as such, has multiple \\"squirm\\" moments.  Those of us who grew up with JEH in the '60's were delighted when the horrible old man died, and I think there are many out there judging this film by the fact that, whatever good he did for the FBI, Hoover became anathema to civil libertarians everywhere.  But Clint Eastwood and his creative staff have done something far more difficult than skewering a sexually ambiguous reactionary.  This movie makes Hoover a person, not just an icon - tormented, megalomaniac, obsessive-compulsive, and far too screwed up to ever come out of the closet, but a man who also believed passionately in his version of America.  He built up the science of American law enforcement almost single-handedly with an obsessive focus that may not be admired, but certainly will never be surpassed.  Clint Eastwood's direction is without flaw and Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant - by far the most difficult, nuanced performance I have ever see him give.  All the actors are excellent, although particular standouts are Armie Hammer's very good Clyde Tolson and Judi Dench, playing Hoover's mother without tripping over a single stereotype.  The whole team are very good indeed and I honor their fairness in trying to find the man behind the mask - even if, once found, he terrifies me.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book consumed my every thought from beginning to end, and I found myself JEALOUS of Ana.  I wanted to be the heroine in this story. I lost sleep from being unable to quiet my mind's need to recall what I had read so as not to miss any detail. And of course, since finishing, I've been comparing the casual male passersby and there is not another that even comes close to being like Christian, which is really disappointing!!  Society has focused so much on beauty and size that many men now believe that they too should be skinny and pretty.  What happened to men being strong, virile, and commanding?  For so long women fought for equality, but men and women were not created equal for a reason and it has now become our downfall. This novel, the Twilight series, and many others have soared to popularity because of the longing to have manly men back.  Yes, I am the female equivalent of a male chauvinist, but come on, really?? A group of people walking and you can't tell the girls from the boys and, even worse...Skinny Jeans For Men???  That just isn't right!  Bring back the Men!

0131480057|4.0|My previous Linux book dated to 1995, so it was long overdue for replacement. I selected this one on the basis of its publication date, hoping it would have material on the various distributions that have appeared in the meantime. This expectation was largely but not completely fulfilled, hence the 4/5 rating. At the moment, I am using Ubuntu 11.10, and it is somewhat different than previous editions. Nevertheless, I have found this book to be much more helpful than one supposedly devoted specifically to Ubuntu 11.10 which I have reviewed elsewhere in this forum. This is a good, solid, meaty book that will help a linux user find the way through the forest.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|What follows is a review of the Game of Thrones: Season One Blu ray set ... not a review of the show itself, of the series, of fantasy as a genre, or anything else.  This is a review to let you know what you're getting when you open the box and put the discs in your blu ray player.<br /><br />What you get:<br /><br />Game of Thrones comes packaged in an attractive fold-out cardboard case with a decorative slipcover.  The box art contains images of various characters in the series: a Stark, some Lannisters, a few Baratheons, and even a Snow just for good measure.  There are five discs in this set, each one emblazoned with the sigil of one of the powerful noble houses inhabiting the world of Westeros.  A handy insert is included, along with some advertisements for other GoT merchandise, providing a brief synopsis of each episode as well as its writing credits.  The insert also contains genealogies of the four main families featured in season one, as well as the members of their housholds, the royal court, and some allies.  Open up this insert, opposite all of the information previously listed, is a full map of Westeros.<br /><br />The Discs:<br /><br />The episodes are spread across all five discs which is convenient enough, but I would have preferred a separate \\"bonus\\" disc.  The special features are listed in the description, but the short version goes like this; there are commentaries on selected episodes and a handful of bonus features on each disc giving you information about houses, characters, history, locations, some making of featurettes and interviews etc.  It's all interesting stuff but nothing wildly unexpected.<br /><br />The interface itself on these discs isn't all that great, although it does look nice enough.  There is no scene selection menu which seems like a glaring omission, and the on-screen bonus features that play while you're watching an episode actually seem pretty distracting.  Sadly a lot of the \\"bonus\\" information is presented entirely astext, which is pretty crummy considering these are blu rays.  It would've been nice to see HBO shill out the extra cash to have a \\"Maester\\" conduct \\"Lessons\\" on the various houses, nations, and other powers at play in Westeros.  This feels like a missed opportunity, but I'm really picking nits.<br /><br />Load times ... oh man load times.  It takes two minutes to load the disc from selecting play on the blu ray player menu to the start of an actual episode.  This.  Is.  Bonkers.  I'm not sure what's at fault here, but I've tried this set on three different blu ray players (Sony BDP S380, Samsung BD-D6700, and an original Sony PS3 Fat/the one that's backwards compatible) and in each case the discs take about two minutes to load.  I've tried disabling BD live, but all that seems to do is make the loading icon (a moving image of a weirwood) disappear ... then again this loading icon only shows up occasionally anyway.  I've encountered reports on a few forums that in some cases people can't get their discs to load at all, fortunately I haven't had that problem and your individual mileage may very - but something is definitely up with these discs.<br /><br />Audio/Video quality:<br /><br />Visually I have no complaints with GoT.  It's honestly one of the most beautiful blu rays I've come across.  There are no artifacts of any sort visible, and black levels and fine detail are revelatory.  Textures pop with insane detail; the hair and pores on an actors face, embroidery on fabric and embossing on leather, wood grain ... it goes on and on.  There's not a single shot that isn't downright beautiful.  Even the darkest night scenes featuring the black brothers, which is essentially black on black, offer no crush or loss of fine detail ... as long as your display is up to the task.  This is one of the best releases on the blu ray format, truly perfect visual representation.<br /><br />As for the sound, uh it's good.  I guess.  I'm not an audiophile, and as such not nearly as concerned with audio fidelity as I am with the visual.  Despite that though the encode on these episodes seems nice enough.  A surround system gives a great sense of presence in all of the environments without ever getting too bass-y or blowing out the high end.  When the Hand has his first council in King's Landing there's a great sense of directionality to the conversation (voices reverberating from walls and columns).  It's one of those small details, but it really sells the experience.  All in all it's good.  And in case anyone is wondering if you're watching these episodes through headphones, a soundbar, or built-in speakers you're not missing out on anything ... I promise!<br /><br />Pros -<br />Game of Thrones: Season One on blu ray is worth the price of admission purely for the quality of the visuals alone.  All of the other stuff is just gravy.  I haven't worked my way through all of the bonus features, but they seem entertaining/educational enough so far.<br /><br />Cons -<br />The biggest one hands down is load time.  I've never come across discs that take two minutes to load up and sadly it's unlikely that anything is going to improve this built-in flaw.  Each blu ray player manufacturer will have to release a firmware update (for specific players in many cases) to address this issue which ... seems unlikely.  If you buy this set and can't stand the load times or can't get your discs to play at all - contact HBO.  Let them know that they're BD java programming sucks.<br /><br />The bonus features could be implemented a little better.  I would've like to have had commentaries on every episode, and I would have preferred a fixed commentator cast as opposed to an ever changing one.  Still what's there in the commentaries is entertaining enough, but the set feels kind of incomplete.  I don't like reading text on my television, not for any decent stretch of time.  HBO should really have taken it upon themselves to film something to show us this information, instead of copy-pasting faq-type material.  A disappointment.<br /><br />Give me scene search ... seriously this has been available on pretty much every title I've encountered since blu ray launched.  This omission is silly.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Despite some serious flaws in execution - load times load times - Game of Thrones is a must buy.  If you've read the books, like fantasy or genre fiction, or whatever ... you have to buy this series.  If epic fantasy isn't your cup of tea, well - borrow these from a friend then.  You just might get hooked.<br /><br />_________________________<br />Edit:<br /><br />Special Features<br />Well it hasn't taken me long to flip flop on some of my feelings already.  In regard to the special features (histories and lore) I've warmed to the short snippets included in this release.  Selecting one of these special features will play an animated featurette, averaging 2-3 minutes, narrated by a relevant character; for example Viserys narrates the title \\"Valyria & The Dragons\\".  These are pretty cool after all, although longer entries and a \\"play all\\" feature would definitely be welcome.  I'm still not thrilled with the on-screen experience during playback of an episode, but I can see that it would definitely be useful for a lot of viewers.  So in that regard, it is a plus.
0553381695|5.0|Great job. I loved how the author moved the plot along by the juxtaposition of the individual chapters which present the action from the point of view of the individual character and how he/she related to others and the story.<br /><br />I just ordered the next two books in the series.[[ASIN:B00794LZTU Harry's War]]

1582403589|5.0|I love this series.  Love it. Sometimes I feel like the artwork leaves something to be desired.  I feel like sometimes the pages are TOO filled up with dialogue, but the story blows me away.  It requires some patience sometimes to read.  It isn't for people who only want to see zombie heads gettin' blowed the hell up.  It's something so much bigger than that.  People are right when they say that these books pick up where the zombie movies end.  In a movie, you only have 2 hours or so to tell the story.  As such, it is impossible to portray the vast scope of the zombie apocalypse in a satisfactory way.  Most of the time, they just focus on killing zombies. However, when you have a comic book series(or the fantastic TV series adaptation on AMC), you have so much more time to explore the depth of it all.  How it affects the characters.  How other survival groups act.  Things like that.  Eventually you find out that maybe the biggest danger isn't the zombies that thrust us into this situation. It is the living that are the most dangerous. A great book that draws you in, makes you care about the characters, then breaks your heart over and over, the Walking Dead is a series that is not to be missed by any zombie fan.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|GREAT GAME this is an awesome game everybody should get this game and I love it and it has a lot of good reviews
B005MW53GW|1.0|This is my second review of an album I just recently purchased that I was quite disgusted at the \\"Remastering\\" of it.  I recently wrote a review of Rush Gold.  It seems they have peaked dB very badly on this album also.  I have good stereo equipment and like to turn music up but the way studio's are hyper-compressing music and clipping the living heck out of it just ruins it.  It doesn't sound horrible at lower levels, but you just can't crank the heck out of it and expect it to sound good.<br /><br />I have included a screenshot of the waveform for Smells Like Teen Spirit in the pictures area.  Notice, all the red in the picture is signal clipping!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The Fire and Ice series is an epic tale with white knuckle adventure and characters you will either fall in love with or 'love to hate'. When you purchase said series, boredom will no longer be a factor of life for days to come; for these books are near impossible to put down. \\"Blessed be the old gods\\"!

0385344228|3.0|I bought this book after seeing the large number of positive reviews here; however, I was disappointed. The premise is great: DA's son accused of murder, and now the DA must flip teams and defend the accused?! Lots of potential for a gripping plot there, but I found the story to fall flat. The only characters who are very believable in the entire book are the teenagers, and no characters are likable. The narrator's stubborn insistence to even consider the idea that his son might be guilty was annoying to me; I realize he's not intended to be a reliable narrator, but due to him sticking his head in the sand, there were a lot of potentially interesting conversations and plot points that were passed up (like when he found that story Jacob had written on the Internet and didn't even mention it to him). Things would've been more interesting if the characters involved had been honest about their feelings and we had gotten to see the conflict caused by that.<br /><br />I found the whole story, and the pace of it, to be just...meh. That's how I felt after reading this book. Disappointed.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|So far it's very enjoyable not sure if it's one of those games that teaser you with a few levels and then makes you pay for the rest we'll see soon enough
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I know I say these words a lot but this time, I truly mean it.<br /> Collins has a way with words, she describes even the most gruesome of matters. This style is what keeps you reading page after page. She writes so naturally that you cannot help but love the story.<br /> I was kind of against reading the story, seeing as the plot consisted of ruthless murder. But, thankfully, a friend said, \\"Just read the first three chapters. Then decide.\\"<br /> Well, I read the first three chapters, but I didn't stop there. I read to about chapter fifteen before realizing it was nearly two in the morning. I had to force myself to put the book down and sleep.<br /> I did sleep, but I also dreamt about the book and what would happen next. This usually never happens. So I was quite surprised when it did.<br /> Collins created characters so real that from the first pages of the book you could feel the emotion within them. You could not help but like even the least likable of characters.<br /> The book was a refreshingly new and unused idea. It takes a step back from the popular teen vampire romance novels, and enters you into a world where everything is slightly similar to our world, but totally different. The book shows that you can still have a slam dunk novel without the use of paranormal activity.<br /> The book is great for males and females alike because the story infuses romance with action and adventure; something that intrigued even me. I am a sucker for some romance, and love the fast paced, blood pumping thrills and chills of action and adventure.<br /> The romance, though said to be, is not sappy at all. It is a fresh and unique twist on love. You can't help but feel sorry for the characters trapped in forced love.<br /> I admire how Collins wrote such a story without once using foul language. She got her points across without once using the language that ruins a story.<br /> Foul language has gotten so over used in fiction these days that it is extremely hard to find a good young adult fiction novel that doesn't use it. I love Collins for her choices. She made the novel that much better.<br /> My sister asked me after I turned the final page, and after I stopped screaming how amazing the book was, \\"What would you rate the book out of ten? Zero being terrible, ten being read again and again.\\"<br /> I replied, \\"This book definitely exceeds a ten! I wouldn't turn down a chance to read this book again! Though, only after I read Catching Fire and Mockingjay.\\"<br /> What I said is completely true. I have become a great fan of this series and cannot wait to read books two and three!<br /> The only thing that I didn't really like was the point of view. I have a sort annoyance at first person, present tense stories. It just seems a little odd. Maybe, though, it is because I am not really used to it.<br /> Despite this, though, I give this book a ten! I highly recommend it for every and anyone who is looking for an amazing page turner!
086571701X|5.0|This is an excellent book to own if you are even thinking about trying aquaponics. The information is very clear. The only complaint I have is that the amount of time I spent wading through various forums and websites could have been saved if this book were released earlier.

1439102724|3.0|I've read many of Picoult's books and loved many of them.  I liked that she covered a very controversial topic, and added music to the experience.  I thought the story just tried to say to much.  I felt like the main characters became overshadowed by how many different crises there were.  While it wan not one of my favorites I do appreciate Picoult's choosing to mainstream a lesbian couple and the difficult journey many women have in becoming pregnant.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|My girlfriend recommended this story, telling me about this self published author she had found.  Usually, I am pretty skeptical of self published work, since it is often rambling and poorly edited.  The price was right, so I took the plunge, and damn, it was worth it.  The author writes with subtlety, and a keen eye for the balance between character development and moving the story forward.  Several times, I realized that my breath had shortened, and realized that I had been written into that corner.  Conceptually, it's a stunner, and I look forward to the next offering.
1451627289|3.0|Yes, once again Stephen King has a produced an entertaining book starting with a \\"this is your reality but here is something supernatural but somehow plausible\\" as a launching point whereby we can indulge the fantasies that extend from the potential invention of time travel.  Everyone has had the fantasy of being able to inject ourselves in the past and alter an event that seems to have been a watershed moment in world or national history.<br /><br />In this book, the protagonist gets that opportunity.  King fills that world with characters and locations which provide both a solid and historically accurate setting and then injects enough color and commentary to breath life into the them.<br /><br />But as with many other King novels of late (see Under the Dome, Cell), this book runs out of steam.  The conclusion of the book requires the reader to move from a mild suspension of disbelief (i.e. fictional, supernatural, but plausible) to drinking from the firehose of fantastical (and irrational) fiction.  Gah ...
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is fun addicting and it works awesome for my kindle fire. the ad's are just like tap zoo. Fun and addicting!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks always delivers. Every one of his books touch your heart in a different way. Just when you think you have it figured out, it knocks your feet out from under you, but in a good way.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I've been a fan of Joss since early \\"Buffy,\\" and remember being bummed when they took \\"Firefly\\" off the air. However, when \\"Serenity\\" closed the circle arc, I realized that the show's early demise actually strengthened the story loop, forcing Joss to focus. Otherwise, it would have gone through several 'trumped-up' endings, like we were subjected to in \\"Buffy.\\"<br /><br />First of all, I love the that \\"Firefly\\", unlike most SF, he focuses on the losers in a high-tech war. Mostly, though, the characters continue to draw me back.<br /><br />To me, the complex mother/ father love dynamic underpinning the relationship between Mal and Inara, and its unexpressed sexual love, is key to the show. That both feel it is undeniable. And their \\"parental\\" love towards the crew saves them from seeming to be just a collection of people. And it seems real to me.<br /><br />The biggest weakness of \\"Firefly\\", as a work speculative world front, is the \\"old west\\" feel on the terraformed worlds. Even though I love westerns, it seems a touch unbelievable here. I understand that the worlds were backwaters. But horses and six shooters? This seems a stretch.<br /><br />But, again, the characters save me. They act much like real human beings, I keep coming back to watch the series again and again.

B007H7XJD4|2.0|This movie is just a bunch of fight scenes that try to look like 300, loosely tied together by a flimsy plot. Half the time you had to suspend your disbelief, because the plot was too lazy to tie things together. You just had to make up in your mind how it all fit together. Boooooooooo!!!
B006UKC566|5.0|One of the best movies in my collection. Forget what the critics say, I love this movie. Definetely in my top 5.
006197806X|4.0|Of all the books I read in 2011 (and I read around 140 according to my Goodreads stats) Delirium by Lauren Oliver is in the top three. I loved it that much. I didn't read it until last September (read my review) which is probably a good thing because the wait from September to February was LONG enough people. So, Pandemonium was obviously a pre-order for me. And yes, the wait to receive it from B&N online was excruciating as well. But it was SO worth it! Are you worried that Pandemonium will suffer the dreaded second- book- in- a series- slump? Worry not, dear friends, this book, while very different in tone than Delirium, will suck you in with it's awesome story, complex characters, heart stopping action, and indescribably beautiful writing that is the hallmark of author Lauren Oliver.<br /><br />Pandemonium begins right where Delirium leaves off. Lena has escaped into the Wilds, and in a way she never imagined: without Alex. The book features alternating chapters in time, \\"then\\" and \\"now\\". I found both of these corresponding story lines to be engaging, and it never really bothered me switching back and forth while I was reading. At a certain point in the story, the chapters seems to echo each other, and eventually converge into the \\"now.\\" I thought Oliver did a really great job with this, I was never lost or confused at any point.<br /><br />But what really grabbed me, right from the start, was how different Lena has become. I mean, it was almost like reading about an entirely different character. In Delirium, Lena starts out as a naive, frightened girl, blind to the world she is living in. She's a \\"zombie\\", as the Invalids like to call them, fully indoctrinated into the world created by the Consortium and those who want to erase all powerful emotions from the people. I loved watching Lena \\"wake up\\" and open her eyes to what was going on in Delirium. But that Lena is nothing like the Lena we encounter in Pandemonium. After struggling in the Wilds she is finally found, close to death, and taken in by a group of Invalids. As she struggles to fit in and find a way to live this new life she's been given, she also struggles with her grief of losing Alex. And her grief is palpable, described in a way that only Lauren Oliver could:<br /><br />'Grief is like sinking, like being buried. I am in water the tawny color of kicked-up dirt. Every breath is full of choking. There is nothing to hold on to, no sides, no way to draw myself up. There is nothing to do but let go.<br /><br />Let go. Feel the weight all around you, feel the squeezing of your lungs, the slow, low pressure. Let yourself go deeper, there is nothing but bottom. There is nothing but the taste of metal, and the echoes of old things, and days that look like darkness.'<br /><br />It's the grief that Lena experiences that shapes and molds her into the person she becomes. Fierce. Hard. Strong. Bitter. The way she functions and works through her loss is to become a cold, fearless, totally kick -butt warrior.For anyone that felt the pacing of Delirium was too slow, or certain pasrts were too drawn out, I really think you are going to like Pandemonium. It's very fluid, moving ever forward, and there is a ton of action scenes. The Lena in Delirium may have been an athlete, but she could have never handles what the Lena in Pandemonium handles, it's pretty awe-inspiring.<br /><br />I loved the action, but I also really loved watching the story's development. I wanted to know more about how this society works, and more about the people who put the laws in place. In Pandemonium we are introduced to the DFA (Deliria Free America), a group headed up by some pretty extreme people. I wanted to learn more about the Invalids and the Resistance, and in Pandemonium we witness the beginnings of the uprising. And I wanted to know more about Lena's mother, where she was, and what really happened to her. Some of these things are touched on briefly, but I know we are going to learn even more inthe final installment of the series. Watching Lena begin to uncover the corruption as various plot threads are twisted together is one of my favorite parts of the book.<br /><br />So what of the romance? Well, we have us a little love triangle going on here. Even though Alex is gone, he is still ever present in Lena's heart and mind. This becomes a problem when Lena meets and forms an attachment to the DFA's poster child, Julian Fineman. I will say that I admire how Lena is genuinely guilt- ridden and distressed when she begins having feelings for Julian. She is constantly comparing him to Alex, and I really liked that Lauren Oliver didn't write off those deep feelings that Lena and Alex shared in Delirium. You could feel her struggle and that made it more authentic. At the same time, liking Lena as I do, I wanted her to be able to open her heart to someone again. She had made herself so hard and cold and distant. When Julian is able to melt away some of that coldness, I though it was a wonderful thing, and I felt happy for them both. No, he's not Alex, but Julian is not without merit. He is just as blind as Lena once was, but like Lena in Delirium, when the chance at love comes his way, he takes it.<br /><br />'Julian steps out of the shadows. Keeping one arm wrapped around my chest, I grab for my shirt.<br />\\"Wait,\\" he calls out, and something about the tone of his voice--a note of command, and also of urgency--stops me.<br />\\"Wait,\\" he repeats, more softly. We're separated by twenty feet of space, but the way he's looking at me makes me feel as though we we're chest to chest, I can feel his eyes on my skin like a prickling touch. I know I should put on my shirt, but I can't move. I can hardly even breathe.<br />\\"I've never been able to look before,\\" Julian says simply, and takes one more step toward me. The light falls differently on his face, and now I can see a softness in his eyes, a blur, and it makes the roaring heat in my body melt away into warmth, a steady, wonderful feeling. At that same time, a tiny voice in the back of my head pipes up: Danger, danger, danger. Beneath it, a fainter echo: Alex, Alex, Alex.<br />Alex used to look at me like that.<br />\\"Your waist is so small.\\" That's all Julian says: in a voice so quiet I barely hear him.'<br /><br />It's really a lovely encounter between them, and in it you can see the seeds of something beginning to blossom. How can you not cheer for that, even just a little?<br /><br />And again, we have the treat of witnessing Lauren Oliver's incredible way with the written word. I swear that woman could write tax laws and I would gobble them up and ask for second helpings.<br /><br />'I was not prepared for the feeling of the sunshine, or the smell of growth and life. All around us are enormous trees, leaves just tinged with yellow as though they are catching fire slowly from the outside, patterning the ground with alternating spots of light and shadow. For a second something deep and old rises inside me and I could fall on the ground and weep for joy, or open up my arms and spin.'<br /><br />Just so beautiful. I'm speechless and completely in awe of her talent.<br /><br />So by now you know from the pre-release and post release buzz that there is another cliffhanger. Honestly, it was no big shock, I saw it coming (I think anyone who reads this will probably see it coming) and yes, it ripped me at my heart as I read the last lines of the book. Just enough to make me rack my brains and wonder who I can pay off to get an early copy of Requiem. Any takers? Just kidding (but not really.)<br /><br />Overall I really, really enjoyed Pandemonium. The only reason(s) it didn't get a full 5 stars from me was because 1)I miss Hana and Grace, and yes, even Aunt Carol a little. I hope we see more of them in Requiem, I guess I need to read the novella Hana to make up for their absence in Pandemonium. and 2) while I did think the Lena and Julian romance was sweet, and fitting for this stageof the story, I miss the swoon factor that was Lena and Alex. I can't help it, I'm a romantic by nature.<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars<br /><br />Cover Thoughts<br /><br />Like the reissue of Delirium last year, the cover of Pandemonium features the same model among more botanical goodness, but this one is in shades of reds, and oranges. It's also got a pretty back cover and is sort of shimmery. I like it. I can't wait to see how the final book in the series compares:)dy, wonderful feeling.

Just pushes through a couple of simple questions to help identify the situation you're in. The decision (to quit or stick) still is yours, and not an easy one to make...
B00005V9IL|1.0|First let me say that I absolutely love this film.  A classic alien encounter movie with suspense, action, and even a love story.  Now why the 1 star?  The video and audio quality is like watching it on a 1980's TV...The special edition has a few more minutes of alien injection and some lame political statements.  Keep the original or theatrical edition and don't buy this expecting quality of any sort.
B0061US58C|2.0|Compared to the first Cars this movie falls flat on its face. I don't know if the director thought the momentum of the first movie would carry over and they wouldn't have to try as hard, but this movie did not meet expectations.
B000THCKF2|5.0|A Passion Play is quite possibly the most under-appreciated work by Jethro Tull.  I will grant you that in the beginning it is difficult to get into but if you give it a chance, as a whole the album is a work of genius.<br /> I do find amusement in those that rail about \\"The Hare who lost his spectacles\\"  In order to understand the purpose of that interlude you may want to understand exactly what a passion play is.  The hare who lost his spectacles is silly, filled with goofy word puns and slighty off pronunciations.  It is a parable and an interlude between the seriousness of a mans journey into the afterlife and the resulting judgement of his life.  The silliness is an intentional break between the very heavy subject matter that A Passion Play revolves around.<br /> The music, especially the instrumental passages, is fantastic and vary from hard rock to classical to Spanish flamenco guitar.  It amazes me how well Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull as a whole blends such a variety of sounds and styles so smoothly.  The transitions are nothing short of brilliant. Add in the heavily philosophical and oft satirical lyrics and you have one incredible piece of music.  If youre looking for pop, look elsewhere, you will be disappointed.  If youre looking for something deeper, than that, then this just may be what youre looking for.  You owe it to yourself to find out.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great walk into 1963; wonderful details that had to have been extensively researched. I was hoping the intensity of the book would pick up after reading the first half, which was devoted to setting the stage, and it did. The last half was so engaging it was hard to stop reading. Seems like a big, long read, at first, but turned-out to be well worth the initial effort.
0307943194|1.0|I've read, and enjoyed, most of John Grisham's books; but this is the most boring, worst book I've ever read by him. A real disappointment. I am one of those people who have to finish a book once I start it, but it took almost a month to finish reading this, and it felt like punishment. I finally finished it though, and am really glad. I'll think long and hard before buying the next Grisham novel. Don't want to HAVE to finish a bad read again, when there are so many good ones I haven't gotten around to yet.

B007EC27QM|5.0|Calculator Plus is an excellent basic calculator with one critical characteristic I was looking for.  It keeps the last value shown on the display even after turning off the Kindle Fire.  I'd been looking for a calculator that met that requirement.<br /><br />Secondly, when I requested that the calculator rotate 180 degrees with the rotation of the Fire, their development team added that feature within a week or so.  I couldn't believe their quick response.<br /><br />I highly recommend this calculator for anyone looking for a great calculator to use on the Kindle Fire.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Eurotrip holds up reasonably well.  I remember watching it back in 2004 and laughing nonstop.  Of course I'm 30 years old now so it's much easier for me to realize the style of laughter is more appropriate for the younger crowd.  The teenage jokes just don't appeal to me the same way nowadays.  However I can overlook much of the sillier and pointless stuff and focus on the well put together storyline.  As soon as the teens make their way to Europe, this is when the laughs REALLY begin.  Before this it's just a typical teenage environment that can be seen in plenty of other teen films.<br /><br />The story is about the one teenager on a quest to search for a German girl he desperately wants to be in a relationship with.  He doesn't travel alone of course- he brings his dim-witted friend and incredibly hot female friend who goes by the name Michelle Trachtenberg (a highly original last name if I do say so myself!  One I can't pronounce either, haha!)<br /><br />Well since it's a comedy, the gang of course find themselves in a few unusual and unpleasant situations.  The most memorable is the naked beach scene.  They think they're going on a nude beach to spot naked women but... they discover something very different and VERY wrong, haha.  The torture device segment involving the one friend is another notable highlight.  Oh, and the train ride with the extra friendly passenger is worth noting.  It's a little gross though!  Perhaps the jokes related to the Pope are a little TOO offensive.  I can't say I found any of this very funny at all.  They went too far here.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful storyline that increases in the laughs steadily which is actually what a good comedy should always strive to accomplish.  I highly recommend it.

1451626657|5.0|This book has been so thoroughly reviewed by so many but I just wanted to add my opinion as well.  I was too young to read it in the 60s when it came out but I recently heard Joseph Heller's daughter being interviewed on Public Radio discussing the 50th anniversary of the publication and decided that I should certainly read this classic novel.  I am so happy that I did! At first I was captured by the humor of the situation and Heller's hilarious and  satirical description of life in the military in Italy during WWII but the further I read, the more horrified I became.  The book is absolutely brilliant in that just beneath the humor is the absolute horror of war and military leaders who were completely incompetent and primarily concerned with their own private or hidden agendas.  The book reminded me of M*A*S*H in many ways.  I strongly recommend that anyone who has not done so already buy and read this book.  This particular edition (The 50th Anniversary Edition) was epecially interesting as it had \\"The Story of Catch-22\\" in the back as well as excellent critiques by other writers in a section entitled \\"Other Voices.\\"
B005DOKM9M|1.0|I found this case extremely disappointing and ultimately returned it to Amazon for credit.<br />My dislike was based on the following:<br />It did not zip all the way around, and thereby could not open and lie flat.<br />It had no inner pocket and was overall a very tight fit, putting my stylus inside made it almost impossible to zip around.<br />The interior was minimally padded.<br />Their was no place for an id or info pocket anywhere on the product.

B007K3JCAE|5.0|While the movie is certainly worthy of praise and is a very excellent sequel to the first one, my review will be focusing on what now has become a monumental case of false advertising about getting a \\"Digital Copy\\" product. To be fair to the movie, I did give this a 5 star rating. There are other excellent descriptions of the movie already published under reviews so I am focusing on the product.<br /><br />What you are getting with this and any other \\"Ultraviolet\\" product is NOT a digital copy. You don't get a copy of anything. All you get is the right to create an account to access the servers of the so called \\"Ultraviolet\\" system. Hence, if you are at an airport, you get the joy of using your data plan to capacity (and paying actual additional dollars if you have exceeded capacity) only to realize that while on the plane, you have no access to your purported digital copy. This is one of the biggest scams in the digital age. Advertising to let you think that you are getting a \\"copy\\" of a movie, when all you get is access to a web site, when it is up, using your own internet bandwidth and the dollars that go along with it. If consumers don't fight this severe advertising deception, soon true digital copies will be a thing of the past and you will be stuck with Bluray vs. iTunes. Buyer beware. Stand up to Ultraviolet and don't let them ruin the digital copy experience. We are all paying good money for these. The least we could get in return is a digital copy to take with us, legally on a plane ride or traveling otherwise.<br /><br />Again, remember, all you get is access to the Ultraviolet website with no guarantee of its continued existence. That is not getting a copy of anything at all. Just a promise that as of today, you will be able to access a web site owned by a greedy conglomerate of movie studios who want to prevent you from having a portable copy of the movie so they don't have to share any profit with companies like Apple.
0807014273|5.0|As with any story of survival I am inspired. However, in addition to recounting his experience in the concentration camps, Viktor Frankl expounds on his unique psychological technique -logotherapy. Of course this is a fascinating and terrifying read but he provides an insight into his experiences that really must be read firsthand to truly be appreciated.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the series on Wednesday and finished it all by Saturday.  What a great series.  Collins created a very vivid look at the dystopia of the future world of the America's.  She was able to weave an image of a nation in the aftermath of a war and the destruction left behind.  Rarely does an author catch my attention so completely as to keep me riveted to the book nonstop.  Collins did that for me.<br />One of my favorite things about this series is the strong female lead.  It is so difficult to create a sympathetic female lead and make the character strong enough to carry a story.  Many times a female lead in in dystopias either have to sacrifice their femininity or ends up relying on the male characters to save her.  In this story, not only does Katniss go into a Battle Royal and Fight with the best of them, she does so while maintaining her strength and determination naturally ingrained into her personality.<br />Many times the love story of these types of novels detract from the main plot line.  In this novel the love triangle is handled with grace and dignity.  As I read I had to remind myself the protagonist was a sixteen year old girl.  She handled herself as a much more mature person.  The love story was able to draw me back into the mind of a teenage girl and the growing up she needed to do throughout the saga.<br />I'm glad I took the time out of my busy life to read this series.  It was well worth my time.
B001VEHZZM|4.0|A very good book, one I couldn't put down. The discussions later in the book about the various leftist orgs were a tad dry, but overall the book was a fascinating read. As the previous reviewers have written excellent descriptions of the war and Orwell's experiences, I'll skip further discussions about that part. What was most interesting to me was the gradual disillusionment Orwell felt towards the communists. But what was distressing is the failure of Orwell to realize that any experiment in socialism, including the Spanish anarchist/marxist movement, would eventually end up with a totalitarian system. Once you tell people, like the anarchists did,  that they can have no private property and whatever they produce is exactly equal to some other person's labor, you have the start of a totalitarian state. This inability to recognize the inherent evil of all forms of socialism is still prevalent among many intellectuals. Apparently Orwell never lost his belief in  the future of some kind of socialism even if he detested the soviet style. It would be interesting to know if there were any major intellectuals of that time who openly sympathized with Franco. I've never heard of any, but there must be some. There has a lot of discussion as to whether it would have been better for the Republicans to win or if the eventual Franco dictatorship was the best outcome. My own view is: a pox on both their houses. However, to pick the best of two very bad choices, I'll favor the Franco dictatorship which gave way to a liberal democracy after Franco's death. If the communists had won, we don't know how long that horrible type of government would have lasted in Spain.
B00269FOHM|5.0|An absolutely beautiful movie.  The actors are perfect and the cinematography is breathtaking.  I have watched it several times and I enjoy it more each time I see it.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Not sure why this didn't do all that well at the Box Office.  This is a great movie.  This is not just a movie about birding.  The movie is really about the lives of three people who want something so badly they will do almost anything to get it, and more importantly, the ramifications of sacrificing everything to get it.  It would be more accurate to characterize this as a movie about \\"Life Choices\\", written against the backdrop of birding.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent and the acting superb.  Although the three lead actors are well known to everyone, they did an outstanding job making me feel a real connection with the characters they played.  I think many people passed on this movie thinking it was just about birding, a subject that they may not be particularly interested in.  But the screenplay does an excellent job of blending someone's passion for birding with a very charming and heart-felt story about human relationships and the life-work balance.  Give this movie a chance.  Hopefully, it will do much better on DVD as word gets around that this is a movie that should not be missed.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|I liked the first one but this is a bit too extreme to the point of stupid and boring. The tilt on the Fire is way too sensitive.  He was on his back more than his bike. I'm also not a fan of bouncing the bike all over the course. Skip this one and get the first one, it's much better.
B007JRU4N0|4.0|This movie was strong.  I loved the acting, George and Shirley were amazing in this movie.  Honestly, there's not much to say about this movie, except for the fact that you will be entertained from beginning to the end.  In terms of script, this is not as good as Sideways, the same type of feeling, different situation, but still, Sideways was 10 times better than this one.<br /><br />However, still, I recommend this movie and its just because of the amazing performance of George Clooney and Shirley.

0312641893|5.0|In one of the markets of New Beijing, a young woman named Cinder works hard to keep her stepmother and stepsisters fed and sheltered.  She is a gifted mechanic, so talented that word of her reaches the royal palace, and the prince himself brings his android to her for repair.  People might wonder how a girl like her became so good at fixing machines, but it's no surprise, for Cinder is a cyborg, part machine herself.  Cyborgs are treated as second-class citizens in New Beijing, though, so she does her best to keep it hidden.  There's enough trouble going around as it is; a horrible plague is sweeping through the city and killing indiscriminately, while the queen of the Lunar people has threatened to declare war on Earth if the prince doesn't marry her.  Through a series of unfortunate events, Cinder becomes enmeshed in the drama of the palace in this sci-fi retelling of the classic fairy tale 'Cinderella'.<br /><br />I loved \\"Cinder\\".  I couldn't put it down, so I whizzed through the entire novel in a couple of hours.  It was just so much fun!  Since the book is a retelling of 'Cinderella', there are certain plot points that must be hit: Cinder must have an evil stepmother, she must go to a ball and dance with the prince, so on and so forth.  But it never seems as if the characters are being forced into certain situations due to plot restrictions by the original tale.  The action and events all unfold quite naturally.<br /><br />One of the best innovations that Meyer brought to the original story was the introduction of a secondary villain/rival for Cinderella.  The course of true love never runs smooth and all that, so the beautiful Queen Levana appears to muck up the budding romance between Cinder and the prince.  Cold, calculating, powerful and lovely beyond measure, Queen Levana is a classic femme fatale who will stop at nothing to get what she wants...and what she wants is to marry Prince Kai and bring all of Earth on its knees before her.  She's dangerous and cruel, and more than a little power-mad.  Levana is the perfect foil to Cinder, who doesn't even control her own life, thanks to her bitter stepmother Adri.<br /><br />I also really liked that the story was set in a futuristic China.  So much of young adult fiction seems to be set in America, even when the authors themselves are from other countries.  It was really nice to get a different culture for once - and wait, does this mean we have an Asian male romantic lead, that rarest of creatures in pop culture?  Why yes...yes it does.  Score one for cultural diversity!cruel, and more than a little power-mad.

B006HGXGWU|2.0|As a real fan of good psychological dramas, horror movies, zombie themes and science fiction movies, I thought I would check out this movie because it was recommended by someone to me.  I could not have been more disappointed. This was the most slow moving, most boring and stupid movie I have ever seen this year.  I only gave it two stars because I felt generous due to the good acting by the star and co-star.  It is easy to understand why this movie did not do good at the box office.  It should have been a clue to me why it never received much exposure.  If you enjoy watching paint dry you will love this movie.<br /><br />Rating:  2 Stars.  Joseph J.

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Setup is simple:<br />1. Remove the batteries and battery plate from your Magic Mouse<br />2. Insert Mobee battery pack<br />3. Plug charging base into a USB port<br />4. Plop your Magic Mouse on the base<br /><br />Unboxing is a delight, setup is a breeze (NO software installation required), and as any good piece of technology, you won't even know its there!<br /><br />My only gripe (which is NO fault of Mobee) is that my monitor shuts off USB power when my laptop isn't connected. It would sure be nice to leave my mouse on the base and come home to a fresh charge...<br />I do have an old aluminum Cinema Display, perhaps the newer Thunderbolt displays and other manufacturer's displays provide power when there is no video input??

I placed the order and he wouldn't shut up about it until it came.  We sat down to watch it and I was really impressed with the story-- very inspirational-- and it really hits home a lot of the values we are all trying to teach our kids.  In fact, it hits you over the head with them a little bit... but in my experience, that approach may just be what's needed with 12 year olds!!  (At least this one.)  He hasn't stopped watching it since-- it's part of his permanent movie-night rotation!

1932100660|5.0|This book opened my eyes to better health and a longer, healthier life.  I have always heard that too much red meat was not good for us and that whole foods were the best, however, the information presented by Dr. Powell  was presented in such a factual and powerful way that it shocked me into a new way of eating and living. Two studies that presented overwhelming evidence that certain cancers can be turned on or turned off nearly by what we eat (or what we don't eat) caused me to immediately change my eating habits - for life. Without trying real hard to lose weight I lost 30 pounds in 3 1/2 months. At my next semiannual medical exam my doctor reduced my Lipitor from 20 MG to 10MG because of my lowered cholesterol readings. And, cancer was only one of many illnesses that studies convincingly showed can be positively impacted, or prevented, by controlling what we eat. Another thing about the book was that it did not to try to sell you anything. It just presented facts determined from various studies in an informative and interesting way.

0307959856|2.0|Clever, successful, and rich,  James is in the habit of having things a little too much her own way. So much so that I could not but wonder why this project was attempted.  It's rather like the result of an assignment to imitate Austen's style and to prove she has understood the novel: pretty good on both scores, but not brilliant at either.  Why does James feel the need to reuse such precise language from P&P? \\"Elizabeth knew rather than felt that she was happy\\"?  I am not sure if I was supposed to recognize this phrase (of course I did), or if it was only a (failed) attempt to recreate Austen's tone? Does she desire my approbation for her many references? These just bogged the tome down. No bright and sparkling tale this.<br />I really expected a plot twist at the end worthy of either James or Austen, and so kept reading,  but none came. At the very least, Willoughby could have done it.

B001YV506S|5.0|The story begins by showing the American dream. Henry Ford is building cars and inventing the assembly line. It appears that prosperity is something everyone can achieve and optimism is high. Then, the depression hits. Where people once owned cars for pleasure and convenience, for some, their car may be their only remaining possession.<br /><br />Charles Howard (Bridges) is a man who started with 21 cents in his pocket and turned it into what most would consider a successful business. He owns a big house and his wife and son seem to be happy. That changes in an instant the day his young son decides to take the car for a spin and ends up being killed in the resulting crash. Howard's wife leaves and he's left behind to rebuild his life.<br /><br />This is the story of unlikely success and second chances. Howard finds new love when he encounters Marcela (Elizabeth Banks) and eventually remarries. He also decides to invest in a horse. His trainer is Tom Smith (Cooper), who has been written off as crazy by most people. His jockey is Red Pollard (Maguire), who has a temper, a history of losing, and has never been considered good at what he does. Howard spends $2,000 on Seabiscuit. The horse has good breeding, but is undersized, apparently lazy, and not likely to become a winner.<br /><br />Each of these damaged characters gets a second chance in life. We see Smith training Seabiscuit. The horse is unruly and will only let Pollard ride him. Howard knows nothing about racing, but he's a loyal owner and believes in his team of misfits.<br /><br />As you can see, there's nothing remarkable about the story so far. But something makes us root for Seabiscuit. The race sequences place the viewer right among the action. It looks and sounds so real that you'll feel as if you are riding one of the horses.<br /><br />The live action is broken up occasionally with black and white photographs depicting people who grew up in this era. It made me think of people no longer with us. They all had lives, hopes and dreams. You can see some of that optimism in their smiles.<br /><br />The film is good at a making you reflect on the past. One major story thread involves Howard's attempts to set up a match race with Triple Crown winner War Admiral. People desperately want to see the two meet, but War Admiral's owner is against the idea and doesn't consider the challenge worthy.<br /><br />The film leaves out a lot of historical details and focuses on a few races rather than Seabiscuit's entire career. As a result, some of the events did not occur exactly as suggested. But it doesn't ruin the story if you watch it without knowing the full history.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the plot. The acting is very good, as you would expect from actors of this quality. Bridges and Cooper are particularly effective. If you avoid films about animals because you don't like to see them get hurt, no horses die at any point. Two suffer injuries, but it's essential to the plot and ends happily.<br /><br />Seabiscuit captured the nation's imagination in the 1930s and represented hope when people needed it most. The story is inspirational and is one of the best sports films I've seen. Any Oscar hopes were crushed by Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, but it was nominated in seven categories.ll had lives, hopes and dreams.

B0078N2MTE|5.0|Excellent movie.  It's rare these days to find a movie that can stir up all kinds of emotions in you which really made me feel connected to the main characters.  The movie had us talking about it after we watched it and I am still thinking about it the next day.  I would definitely watch this movie again.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|While this book has been tagged with \\"Young Adult\\"-I have to say that although I am an adult, but not terribly young, I absolutely loved this book! Suzanne Collins takes you on a journey, young adult or older adult, that sucks you in and keeps you there. I haven't been so \\"into\\" a series since the \\"Twilight\\" saga. The characters are well laid out, the premise of the story is thought-provoking and wonderfully-interestingly different. It is written in such a way that it's easy to forget that these characters were simply born in Suzanne Collins' delightful imagination, while each character feels so living, that they take up residence in your own mind while reading. The story just springs to life and I find myself wondering what will happen next throughout the day, as I like to save my reading for the evening, as a treat at the end of the day. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is just that- a special treat that you should get yourself if you love great fiction. For those who are concerned about explicit language or sexual content, I found none. Suzanne Collins shows one can achieve phenonemonal success with sheer talent and a fabulous imagination without needing to throw in bad language and such. I would feel quite comfortable recommending this book to young and older adults alike, I highly recommend this book, it was a great pleasure to read!

B004ASNG04|5.0|This book tracks the development of human civilisation from around 10000BC to the modern day. It confronts many of the myths of history that has plagued comparisons between the West and the East. The book takes time to define the concept of Eastern and Western cores and tracks their development and shifting locations. Ultimately it seeks to answer the question as to why does the Western core seems to be on top for now. The general impression from the book is that the West rule through a combination of geographic luck and a slightly out of sync development cycle with the Eastern core. Overall a fantastic book and well worth the read. It will confront some misconceptions about the differences between East and West and give the reader a better appreciation for the world we live in today.

B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Too bad this series didn't last.  I never saw this in primetime and was not introduced to the series until after watching the full-length movie Serenity, which seems to be on cable at least once a week.  Doesn't follow the usual good-guy-bad-guy SciFi recipe.  Everyone is a bad guy, the view just learns to like the main characters through our experiences with them.  Perhaps this is a Joss Welden trademark.
0517548232|5.0|Henry Hazlitt was not only a gifted economist. He wrote in a no-nonsense style, demolishing seemingly persuasive, highly complex or even tortured arguments in favour of suboptimal economic policies. Much as Copernicus placed the sun, rather than the earth, at the centre of the solar system, thereby greatly simplifying astronomical calculation and eventually enabling Kepler and Newton to explain planetary motion and gravity in simple, eloquent equations, so Hazlitt masterfully simplifies the world of economics, in both theory and practice. Each chapter of Economics in One Lesson is a tour-de-force critique of one or more misguided economic policies. In his own time, using his powerful economic insight, he was able to predict a broad range of future economic developments, including the dollar devaluation and stagflation of the 1970s, the devastating impact of rent control on urban housing, the counterproductive effects of trade barriers and the distorting aspects of many forms of regulation, taxation and government subsidies. Armed with the common sense knowledge explained cogently in this volume, non-economist readers will find they can make much better sense of economic developments and see far easier through politicians' and policy makers' frequently deceptive arguments and false promises. Economics in One Lesson is more than just an outstanding book, it is probably the best introductory book on economics ever written.<br />John Butler, author of The Golden Revolution: How to Prepare for the Coming Global Gold Standard (John Wiley and Sons, 2012)
B005MJFA2W|5.0|This book will illuminate the reader to how the brain works through its two different aspects. The author presents the view that there's a slow brain and a fast brain. The slow brain is the one you control, it's methodical, calculating and generally the one in charge. The fast brain is the one that lets you make snap decisions and generally drives a lot of the things we do each day on auto pilot. The author takes time to present many examples that illustrate the two sides of the brain as well as covering many other psychological topics such as regression to the mean etc. Overall an excellent read and for anyone who has an interest in how and why we make the decisions we do then they will find this book a very worthwhile read.

0140177191|5.0|The late Marion Zimmer Bradley's achievement with The Mists of Avalon is remarkable. She broke new ground by completely re-imagining the Arthurian legends, a Herculean literary task. Modern successors include Wicked--now a hit musical--and various examples of female heroines replacing male heroes. Yes, there is a nebulous 'feminist' aspect to this book, but really I would characterise it as 'humanist' or 'individualist' instead. The heroes of this book, male or female, are those that think for themselves, rather than for someone or something else. Reason, experience and a willingness to listen to Mother Nature: These qualities enable the heroes of the book to triumph, at least to some extent, against incipient tyranny. Yet there is no real redemption here. Fans of Norse mythology and its relative lack of any redemption will enjoy this epic. Indeed, I would go so far as to claim that Ms Bradley is re-imagining the Norse sagas as much or more as the overt Arthurian plot that gives the book its core structure. Nevertheless, this book is far too rich and complex to be summarised properly in a review of this length. I recommend it, to be sure.<br />In the interest of full disclosure, now in my 40s, I read this book as a teenager and, you might say, it changed my life. For the better I might add. This review is but a soft echo.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read this series in 3 days and I have mixed feelings about it, first of all I understand that this is a Twilight fanfiction from another universe so I understand the general story of why they are so deep in love after only 2 seconds. Let's start with what I liked about the books:<br />the actual story of two people who have nothing in common and so many obstacles to overcome finding true love is a decent story line, they had some ups and downs and were really at some point in the book quite cute as a couple and you wanted them to work it out. Christian had better character development in my point of view, you could see him evolving as a person as he learned to cope with life after so many years being shut off from everyone. It is generally a good story.<br /><br />Things I didn't like:<br />The author is British so everyone they talk to outside of their families almost is British too, no one cares as much as Ana does about people's accents and if they are European or not. There are way too many errors both grammatical and British/American references misused throughout all the books. The one thing that drove me absolutely NUTS was the timetable in these books, who can get into a car chase on Wednesday, almost raped by your boss on Thursday and then held at gun point by your boyfriends ex-sub on Friday and still be able to go to Aspen on Saturday and have the best weekend of your life!!!! The author should have spread the timeline out over months not just the what 6 weeks total not counting the 3 month skip over to the marriage at the beginning of the book. Ana was too stupid for me, she badgered Christian when she knew he had problems and would push him to answer inappropriate questions while they were having good moments, and when they needed to talk she would succumb so easily to him just looking at her. Her \\"inner goddess\\" needed to be tied up and thrown in a closet because she had no sense. Ana's character lacked in several areas and Christian was developed okay but we could have gotten more. This story seemed rushed to me and I would have liked a little more character development, time in between and realistic plots. And I'm sorry I liked Taylor but anyone in charge of my security that let not one but TWO armed people get into my CCTV'd code needing to get into the garage and elevator one the 30th floor would have been FIRED!!!!<br /><br />I feel like it just needed to be more thought out but after I got over all the errors and blah sex scenes that seemed almost to be copied and pasted from one page to the next it was an okay story, the ending needed work, how can leave a story at the beginning of a pregnancy when the characters are still having so many problems? Then jump to 3 years later when they are happily ever after and you don't know how they got their? Wasn't that supposed to be the point of the trilogy?<br /><br />I give the author kudos for publishing this, just think it needs better editing and a bit more follow thru! I would definitely be interested in seeing things from Christian's point of view like the teaser at the end hinted at. If you can get past all the crap it really is a good story.

1451648537|5.0|You're either an Apple Fan boy or you're not (I'm not, as a rule). I suspect many of the reviews of this book are, therefore, proxy votes not on Walter Isaacson's talent, but Steve Jobs'.<br /><br />Isaacson has, as the heart of his book, the Steve Jobs business philosophy. It is this, as much as jobs' unnatural flair for design, which separates him from his peers: most of the rest of the founding fathers and prophets of the tech revolution - Hewlett, Packard, Grove, Gates, Brin and Page, Fanning, Lessig, Zitrain - even Apple's own Wozniak - are united by the same insight: that modular components which put the decision in the hands of the user make for a tremendously powerful thing. This is the genuinely revolutionary, anarchic disposition which has shocked the political, corporate and social order over the last 20 years. It's a revolution of which Steve Jobs, and his beloved Apple, wanted no part.<br /><br />It is difficult to conceive of how different the world now is - hard to remember how rigid and immovable was the social architecture which the internet blew away (but which, if Zitrain is to be believed are regrouping forces). Flying in the face of the Web 2.0 dogma, Steve Jobs, virtually alone, believed in closed, tightly integrated, designed, controlled products. This remains a profoundly old-fashioned outlook for a tech company to adopt.<br /><br />Isaacson does an excellent job of highlighting a colossal *conceptual* chasm between Apple and the rest that most users simply won't credit. An iPhone is, philosophically a very different thing to an android smartphone. An iMac is a profoundly different thing to a PC. Your preference between them still comes down to an instinct: as between closed and open; tight and loose; predictable and flexible; probable and possible; centrally planned and laissez faire; design and fiat and even, melodramatically, God and evolution. These days most folks seem to prefer centrally planned, at any rate inasmuch as they buy Apple's articulation of it.<br /><br />Apple's articulation of it, of course, has been incredible. Even Bill Gates acknowledges that Apple has made some really cool stuff. (I'm hacking this review out on a dented Blackberry Curve, but coveting the iPad on the lap next to me. It irks me, but I really want one). And Steve Jobs accomplished this in a way that illustrates the validity of his model, however awkward that might be for the political orthodoxy. And he was a beastly bit of work while he was at it.<br /><br />Walter Isaacson gives the most sullen Googlista reason to respect Steve Jobs' achievement, and the most fawning mac apologist reason to abhor him. Jobs was a difficult individual with little of the grace and style of his products. He was prone to angry tirades, and was often instantly dismissive of what turned out to be excellent suggestions. He was similar with his family. Those who stayed close enough, personally or professionally, to understand how he ticked (notably Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, wife Laurene Powell, chief Apple designer Jony Ive and Isaacson himself) learned to accommodate his foibles remarkably effectively, ignored the histrionics and did what they felt was the right thing anyway. Which, as Isaacson makes clear, is what Jobs expected anyway.<br /><br />This is a well told story about the singular vision of a remarkable man.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonarticulation of it.<br /><br />Apple's articulation of it, of course, has been incredible.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I purchased the trilogy in order to be up to date before the movie came out. I fell in love with the books!

B004GTLFNW|5.0|I've been a dedicated weight lifter for many years now and I've long shunned bodyweight exercises, but this book changed my perspective on them.    I was VERY surprised at how much of a challenge even the beginner workouts were! They are perfect for getting in shape in 30-45 minutes per day and explain exactly what you should do and why. Bodyweight routines are especially good for people that can't make it to a gym regularly, for whatever reason (this is great for travelers and/or heavy commuters).    In this book you'll learn about different training methodologies like ladders, tabata, invertals, and more, and some workouts will have you doing many reps at a lower intensity, while others call for fewer reps but a higher intensity. These types of workouts are great for not only strengthening and building muscles, but losing fat too.    I liked how many different exercises are given in this book. It's basically a bodyweight exercise encyclopedia!    There's a little bit of information on diet and nutrition, but the focus is clearly on exercising.    The bottom line is if you want to have a lean, strong, and functional physique and aren't going for bulging muscles, then you should read this book and apply its principles and methods.    P.S. Another great exercise & fitness book I recently finished is [[ASIN:B006XF5BTG Bigger Leaner Stronger: The Simple Science of Building the Ultimate Male Body (The Build Muscle, Get Lean, and Stay Healthy Series Book 1)]].     It taught me just about everything I could want to know about how to eat and train to maximize muscle growth and fat loss. It's geared toward weightlifting but the principles apply to all types of exercise. I highly recommend it.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|This is the first book I have read about body language, and it was excellent (especially on Kindle)!  The language is not overly \\"jargony,\\" and the author presents the material so that it is accessible to intelligent, non-experts.  Furthermore, he provides real-world examples of his body language reading skills, as opposed to simply listing off a series of actions.  I think it was important that he cautions the reader often about jumping to conclusions based on one or even two actions- a liar is often indistinguishable from someone who is nervous, even to experts in this field.  Who isn't nervous when called in by the big boss suddenly?  He points out that body language is a much more useful tool for gauging how someone is reacting to your conversation and very handy to ascertain topics that make the other party uncomfortable, allowing you to either continue pursuing that subject or change subjects depending on the circumstances.  This has come in handy in my day-to-day interactions.<br /><br />The illustrations are great, however it would have been nice for more of the really subtle movements to have a contrasting image to compare it to, side by side.  This wouldn't be an issue with the hard-copy edition, but in a kindle hopping back and forth between pages some distance apart can become tedious (especially if you didn't flag it!).<br /><br />I am a Joe Navarro fan, and will be reading some of this other books soon!  Please keep writing Joe!

I believe this is true.<br />When we heard about the show and were told that it is a High School Chemistry teacher down on his luck who begins to make the drug meth, we thought the person suggesting this show as a must watch had to be out of his mind.  We were wrong.<br />Like Meth, it is an addictive show and a must see.

1400069289|5.0|\\"The Power Of Habit: Why We Do What We Do And How To Change It\\" by Charles Duhigg is a fascinating look at how habits work with very interesting case studies and research.  According to Duhigg, the key to becoming more productive, exercising regularly, tapping into our reserves of creativity, building revolutionary companies and social movements, conquering our most stubborn vices, and, ultimately, achieving success is to understand how habits work.  After reading this book, you will understand just how powerful habits really are, and realize the truth behind Duhigg's statement.<br /><br />The case studies Duhigg uses to illustrate how powerful habits can be are engaging and enlightening.  They made me stop and think about things I've done, and how I'd been influenced, and how maybe some of my habits were influenced by outside forces.  It was also a little shocking to see how habits are related to what some may call addiction, most notably in the study on a woman who's gambling habit spiraled out of control.<br /><br />The book is divided into three main parts.  The first, The Habits of Individuals, contains chapters on the habit loop, how habits work; the craving brain, how to create new habits; and the golden rule of habit change, why transformation occurs.  Part two, The Habits of Successful Organizations, starts with a chapter on keystone habits, or the Ballad of Paul O'Neill, which habits matter most; then goes to Starbucks and the habit of success, when willpower becomes automatic; the power of a crisis, how leaders create habits through accident and design; and how Target knows what you want before you do, when companies predict (and manipulate) habits.  Part three, The Habit of Societies has two chapters, and these focus on Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, how movements happen; and the neurology of free will, are we responsible for our habits?<br /><br />I really think this book will open the eyes of many people.  Especially enlightening is how large corporations analyze buying habits and patterns to specifically market toward those habits.  Learning how stores such as Target collect, analyze, and use information was extremely interesting if not a bit scary when you think about what organizations know about people, and how they influence what people buy and use.<br /><br />The book is a fun and interesting read, but also very educational.  The knowledge gleaned from this text has the power to help individuals as well as businesses.  There is an Appendix titled \\"A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas.\\"  Unfortunately, this Appendix was not included in the Advanced Reader's Edition I'm reviewing, so I can't comment on how clearly and easily the author explains how to use the information.  With that said, a little thinking on the concepts contained in this book will allow any reader to incorporate ideas in a variety of ways.  However, it might not be easy or quick.  The author points out, \\"Transforming a habit, or a life, isn't necessarily easy or quick.  It isn't always simple.  But it is possible.\\"  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about habits and explore the possibilities of creating or transforming habits.  They really are powerful.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the \\"Tough Guy Wisdom\\" series and others.how large corporations analyze buying habits and patterns to specifically market toward those habits.

B005FITIGO|3.0|I loved the New York urban scenes at night.  Good acting.  I'm sorry to say I got so bored that I fast-forwarded through some of the middle section. The primary problem addressed was that this financial company was over-leveraged and how that affected the employees.  The primary action of the story is seeing who gets fired and who doesn't and then watching them carrying their belongings from their office outside the building. People who have been fired from their jobs can relate to this story--I guess.<br /><br />However, I think this film has historical significance.  It is a visual interpretation of the Wall Street mess during the last few years.  Now that we know that this industry has bounced back bigger than ever, it makes the CEO's (played by Jeremy Irons) languid attitude toward his firm's big problem of being over-leveraged seem correct, even though in the film, his coolness and composure towards the problem at hand seems like indifference bordering on corruptness.  The scene I liked best was when the Kevin Spacey character hugged his dog. The dog should have been nominated for an Oscar for making us believe he was dying.  I also watched the director/writer narration version on the DVD, but I'm sorry to say I fell asleep in the middle of it.<br /><br />I might also add that I have worked in the downtown NYC financial industry during which I also had to drink coffee continually to stay awake.  In the film, the main characters pull an all-nighter, but it doesn't show any of them drinking coffee. Where were the coffee cups?

B0071MV540|3.0|The basic problem is that it's not funny despite big name comedians at the helm and it's a pretty weak heist film. The comedy is really non-existent and both Stiller and Murphy are looking past their prime. There's a whole army of extra people behind them that don't really add much to the film either.<br /><br />As a heist film - and I assume it is based on the title - it really doesn't cut it. I kept waiting for plot twists and developments that never happened. If you like movies such as Confidential, Heat, Die Hard, The Thomas Crown Affair or The Score, you'll probably find the heist elements of this film quite weak. The location of the hidden money is fairly obvious early on and serves as a plot device for a good 50% of the film.<br /><br />There are a handful of over-the-top but enjoyable action sequences and some limited character set pieces. As entertainment for a couple of hours it's fine, but I don't see myself watching it again.
B000PMG16U|1.0|This is for anyone who has not yet wasted there money on these three absolute pathetic attempts at re-creating the wonder of the original series.

I will focus on the three items that in my opinion are the most glaring.<br /><br />First: Obi Wan has a complete an utter lack of knowledge of R2D2 and C3PO in the original... and yet in the prequels he spend hours with them, knows their names, bad habits, and favorite colors.... not just odd... stupid. I must assume Obi-Wan is not the problem.... Lucas must have had his memory erased while watching Men in Black.<br /><br />Second, A scientific explanation of the force is given that destroys the magic of the movies. Thus violating J.R.R. Tolkien's number one principle of good storytelling (and making the films a bad imitation of Star Trek in the process) - NEVER EXPLAIN THE MAGIC!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Third, the Jedi have become a pathetic group of celibate morons who can be killed like flies by any Sith lowlife. Further, and perhaps worse, in the third of these sad films, Obi-Wan actually undermines the entire series with one utterance: \\"Only the Sith deal in absolutes.\\" If this is the case what has the whole light side/dark side been, Lucas? Political correctness brought to a Galaxy far, far way thanks to an out of touch, now member of the Hollywood elite, that has proven he has forgotten how to make a good film...Crystal Skull anyone?<br /><br />P.S. ...I didn't even mention the sacrilegious \\"Virgin Birth\\" fiasco... oops!<br /><br />P.P.S. I almost forgot to mention..there is one good thing about these films...buy the soundtracks! John Williams delivers where Lucas fails!

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Awesome game can't stop playing it. If you like puzzle games this is for you. Bought it on sale today and haven't put<br /> it down yet. Samsung Galaxy S II
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am still learning how to use this app but so far I like it. Having it sync to all my devices is great!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I think twitter is really fun because its kinda like face book. you can talk to your freinds and familly.
B004H1YH66|5.0|Just like my review for the extended Conan the Destroyer soundtrack, my reveiw for this extended Conan the Barbarian soundtrack is the same.  The sound in this is crisp and excellent. It is as engrossing as the original movie recording but there is more to take in when listening and comparing the differences. The differences are clear but subtle and pleasant. I'm definitely not playing down the original movie recording. This is not an EXACT reproduction of the original but it is very close -- this faithfully complements the original movie recording VERY well for the serious Conan fan and offers you MORE along the same lines with pleasant surprises. It plays out more evenly in stretches letting you sink into the music a little meditatively longer than with the original movie soundtrack. The parts that were not heard before were excellent. Thumbs up! A great listening favourite. Top quality.
B007704HO6|5.0|Don't recall where I saw the book cover early this morning, but I fell in love with Bob's picture and bought the Kindle edition.  Downloaded it, got sucked in reading the first few pages and didn't put it down until I'd finished reading it a few hours later.<br /><br />I laughed out loud and had tears running down my cheeks as I read their very touching and heart-warming story ... and I hated that the book had to end.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your stories with us, James and Bob!<br /><br />All the best.<br />hal<br />TwoBigCats
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is awesome. when I go to church I can use it and its really fast so it don't take so long. bye!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book starts off a little slow but in the end of the book it is as thrilling and awesome as the first Hunger Games book. You should read it too it's a great book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is everything and more.  I wanted an app that would allow me to have God's words with me everywhere I go.  This app does that, but at the same time offers a large amount of ways and resources to build your relationship with God and his words.  I thank God for those that created this...it is truly amazing!!! Amen
B003CW67TQ|5.0|Excellent mystery , couldnt put the book down , Im usually good at guessing `who did it` but this time I couldnt , cant wait to read the next Jo Nesbo book.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|I like how I could download these track. I very like the music track of the soundtrack to Disney's \\"Tron Legacy\\". Also, I like the bonus track #23 to this soundtrack. The Amazon MP3 Exclusive Version is worth the price and you would like it.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Well I'm glad I only rented it. Just watch \\"300\\" again not that that was any good either. don't bother with this drivel. It was just a cash grab by the actors.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|Well I'll give a fair review with Pros and applicable drawbacks or Cons for this app.<br /><br />(1) This one is probably the best PDF reader app for mobile device out there due to many customization features.  However, the developer does not bother the update this app here in Amazon.com.  If you've noticed that this app version currently, as of date of writing this review, is 1.8.0.0.  Whereas, if you go to Google Play you would see that the developer has been keeping the app updated regularly, and currently, to version 1.8.1.0 by 3/16/12.  Yet, the price is the same.<br /><br />(2) Some of the best customization features, or Pros, that are selling point for this app are: (a) importing your own pdf file and (b) have text reflow to fit nicely for reading the pdf documents on your mobile the device, (c) smooth scrolling and rotate pages seamlessly and (d) save the pages where you last read; (e) it also has night/mode just like a book reader app; and, other commonly expect features of a pdf readers etc.<br /><br />However, here are some applicable drawbacks, or Cons, to the above features: basically these features are short of user's experience:<br />a) You gonna have to learn manual ways of importing pdf file to your device.  This app here on Amazon.com does NOT support Google Doc that the one on Google Play would and that allow you to install \\"ezPDF Reader Cloud Plugin\\" (this one on Google Play).  Developer's response?? Blaming the Amazon's \\"policy\\"!<br /><br />b, c & d) The text Reflow feature is a nice feature and you will like it.  However, when you close the app, while the page would be saved where you left, you will have to Reflow the text again.  Also, although the Reflow feature will allow you smoothly scroll and swipe the page up and down, you will have to MANUALLY turn the page when you reach the end.  The Reflow does not do it on the next page for you.<br /><br />(3) Other highly rated features are: write and type on the document, highlight or underline and Video and audio on PDF and Listen to your document with TTS (Text to Speech), and even look up word on dictionary.<br /><br />However, you might want to recognize that this is an app for PDF viewing, NOT editing.  In other words, it is a downgraded version and features of Adobe pdf reader that provides some additional features just to fit your mobile devices.  You can write and type but on the editable form.  Of course you can copy and paste a word just like on Adobe Reader.  Do you like the Text to Speech on the Adobe Reader? Also, you can look up the word through ColorDict... Have you heard this dictionary?  Neither do I.<br /><br />If you still find yourself convinced to get this app, I would advise to purchase one in Google Play.  You could have tried to the free regular version and/or the Lite version there first, but now the developer pulled that free version off the market and charge you $1.00 for the Lite version.  I don't know why Amazon.com still allow this stripped down version app that has no support by the developer.  It is overpriced and overrated!
B005ETA5K2|3.0|The signal distance of this product is far less than what I expected, the advertized range of 2000 meters is grossly exaggerated. It is not much stronger than my hp G620US built in wireless adapter but it gets the signal where my hp can't. the signal is constant and doesn't drop but the signal strength must be at least 90%. The short 4ft cable makes it difficult to mount near a window, or outside which means you have to rely on an extension USB cable, however the cable I bought weakened the signal drastically.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|not happy. getting an error while downloading. this sucks. Tried shutting down then trying again, didn't work? anyone have any suggestions
B003XU7VM4|4.0|I am a fan of the show, and thought reading a \\"Castle\\" book would be fun.  It absolutely was.  The ghost writer does a great job of writing in the street-savvy, slightly cheesy way you'd expect the character of Rick Castle to do it.  There is an element of the pulp mystery feel and its fun to recognize all characters from the show as the author interprets them in the novel.  The story itself is a good mystery without being impossible to figure out or follow and a simply enjoyable fluff read.  I'd like to know who the author actually is to find some of their own work to check out.  Totally worth your entertainment time.  I will be looking for the next few in the series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|its a really good Apo to were you want to just make a note and be able to view it every where like from the computer and phone its one of the best apps ever.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|Ok I'm not here to say how Florence is wonderful and a unique artist, blah, blah! This album is indeed great. I bought the first and took a while to like it but after a while I loved it. I also bought the B-Sides and that too was an awesome album. Now for Ceremonials, well it only gets better! I listen to most genres, got some 100 different albums on my Ipod, but I just seem to come back and hitting play on this album.<br />I was hoping there would be more 500 reviews but only saw some 200 so Im here also to support her and to make people buy this album by giving it a positive review.
B007HJB55G|5.0|This was the best show I have watched that was taken from an excellent series of books I was not expecting it to be this good, the casting was great and it followed the books marvelously I love these type of films and books so needless to say I was very impressed.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoyed the game would like an auto fill option in settings. One of my go to games. Nice graphics. Thank you.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is the best start to a series of books that took me three days to read. They never let you down and keep going. The Hunger Games starts off a little slow but picks up quickly and then you don't want to put it down. Guilty pleasure for sure.
B007HJB6OG|5.0|This was the best show I have watched that was taken from an excellent series of books I was not expecting it to be this good, the casting was great and it followed the books marvelously I love these type of films and books so needless to say I was very impressed.I only wish Sean Bean was not killed off if I was casting I would bring him back to play a different part clean shaven he looks so different like in the new series Missing with Ashley Judd.

B002APU580|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and goes along perfectly with the novel by jane austen. I would rate this movie over any other pride and prejudice movies i have seen.

B005DI9HPI|3.0|March's theme in Chick Lit and Other Fiction is location, location, location.  The destination chose New York City by way of London England.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />Angela is attending her best friend Louisa's wedding in London England,  when she discovers something in her car.  All she wants is to change her shoes from these dreadful louboutins that she had to wear for the ceremony.  Mark her boyfriend surprises her with his cheating partner.  Angela's world collapses as she realizes that her world has changed forever.  Her answer leave go to New York City in the United States.  Angela arrives with little more than the louboutins and her bridesmaid dress.  Enter Jenny her new best friend who helps Angela heal from her heartache and take a different path.  Angela is confronted by many changes but what will she choose?<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I have heard a lot about this series and the initial book of the series I Heart New York.  I am always game for trying new authors.  I loved how the writing seemed to flow.  I could have taken a little less of the sex issues.  I liked Angela as a character and thought her cohort Jenny was great as well.  The author does a great job describing Angela's dilemma and her indecisiveness.  I just didn't find myself loving the book as much as I thought.<br /><br />A popular plot in the chick lit genre is woman dumped by boyfriend and trying to start over.  I have actually loved a lot of these plots because it is exciting to see what the main character will choose to do.  For instance in I Heart New York, Angela's growth in character after her decision to leave London.  I wish I had a credit card limit like hers.  What would you try if you had the chance to start over?
B005723JSQ|4.0|Poppy is the kind of girl who always tries to see the bright side of everything, and even in the face of extreme tension, she has a way of making you smile. Her energy is infectious, and I love how hard she tries to engage Sam's soft side. Sam tries valiantly to be rough and gruff, but it is fruitless in the face of Poppy's optimism. This story is fun, lively, and really makes you hope for the best for both of these characters.<br /><br />Lototy<br />Reviewer for Coffee Time Romance & More
0439023521|5.0|I bought this book really last minute just so I could read it before the movie comes out. I wasn't expecting anything, I actually thought I was going to get a completely torn up, used book because of the very low price. I was okay with that though because all I wanted was to read it fast before theaters. When I received it, it was brand new, never been opened! I was so surprised. I just wasn't expecting it but I'm very happy with my purchase, especially because it was so cheap! I'm spreading the word to other people who are book shopping.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Nice family movie good Rocky type theme , it moved along at a good pace some nice action cool premise.
B002IFT1ZA|2.0|~~~ W A R N I N G ~~~  If you find gay sex scenes repulsive and unnatural, do not watch this series unless you are prepared to fast forward through several scenes.  The books do not have these scenes so if you are a fan of the books, you may not like the changes.
B006C45CFG|2.0|This movie is just as idiotic as the title would suggest. 90% of it is a decent western, 10% is poorly done horror movie. If they would have made it into a straight western it would have made more sense. Those looking for horror should pick another movie as you'll likely be disappointed. And to top it off the aliens were very badly done - looking like something right out of a 50s B movie. For me, I am sorry I wasted my $4.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I didnt get it at first. But when I looked at the hints. Oit was like the answer key. All I had to do wa4 look at each hint.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|i have surrond sound Bose speakers and the music played great but the dialog was whispered and it left me wondering what was going on. The trailers played the best parts. I rented 300 again and saw good show afterwards.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|The movie itself is pretty blah. The story is dull, the main character could have been interesting but he ends up being boring. They tried to make this movie into an artwork and because they spent so much time on that they failed to deliver in other areas such as plot and dialogue. The only exciting parts of this movie are the few violent scenes which in my opinion are extremely gruesome and completely over the top much like what happens in a Tarentino film. The difference is here, the scenes don't really even fit, it's as if it just happens randomly.<br /><br />I left this movie with nothing, no feeling or anything.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is brutal. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it is truly awful. Awful movie in general.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I don't understand all the bad reviews! This movie was GREAT! I don't normally write reviews but over 200 one stars for this movie is ridiculous!!!!

B004W2UBYW|3.0|It's a reasonable biography, but far below my expectations.  I skipped about a third of the book, specially the parts regarding the relationship with the daughter and was left wanting to know more about how he actually managed to change the world we live in.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game!!!!! It really is for children and I spend hours playing it!!!! It is fun and on the kindle fire it works great. I totally reccomend it to everyone!!! :)
B0069GRIHW|5.0|Excellent re-mastering of a classic! Second CD features uncut studio sessions. I love it! No one does it like The Doors and no one will ever repeat their sound.

B000HF6ZR0|4.0|This movie is a fun flick--not too cerebral, and not too cheesy. If I had to describe it in as few words as possible, I would say that it's like a mixture of \\"The Thing\\" and \\"The Abyss.\\" There's a lot of paranoia and suspicion when things start to occur, and no one is quite sure where to put the blame. So if you like that sort of mystery/science whodunnit-style cinema, you will enjoy this. True, some of the acting is hammy, and at times it can be overly cheesy, but it's a good cheesy.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very good app for getting remote access.  Let's you remote in on your network via wifi, or if you attach your google account, you can remote in from anywhere. Won't wake a PC, though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I never get to read much anymore, too busy at work, but I had a week of vacation. I saw the previews for the movie a few weeks ago and thought the premise was interesting. I downloaded the first book for my tablet and started reading on the plane. Wow...I was hooked. A few days later I had to download the second book and then a few days later the third. Now that I am done, I don't know what to do. What an amazing story. Awesome to read. Had to force myself to put the book down at 2 in the morning to get some sleep. That was an awesome vacation which included starting and finishing the trilogy within the week. At least I have work to go back to and the opening of the movie at the end of the week. Bravo!

B001UHOWW4|4.0|Audrey Hepburn is irresistible in this frothy adaptation of the Truman Capote novella. An immediate box-office smash, the film was followed up a scant three hours after its premiere by the sequel, LUNCH AT TIFFANY'S.
006197806X|5.0|Lena's life after arriving in the wilds are composed of two parts: \\"now\\" and \\"then\\". \\"Now\\", readers meet a new Lena. A stronger person than she was before, because of what happened while trying to escape, and what happens \\"then\\".<br />This story is so fast paced and action-packed, there is never a dull moment.<br /><br />I have this thing that I do when reading: I always try to figure out the ending as early as possible. If you pay attention early on, it is definitely easy to figure out how the story will end. However, Lauren Oliver does an amazing job making the in-between moments just an important and enjoyable as the beginning and the ending. Just as many unanswered questions from Delirium were finally being answered, more questions are raised, and it just makes next year when the final installment to the delirium trilogy seem that much further away.<br /><br />Loved: The last scene. I tried to turn the page of my nook book, because there had to be more, when I reached the Acknowledgments page. The cliff-hanger is pleasurably painful. You accept that the book is over, because you know the next one will hopefully answer all your burning questions.<br /><br />Disliked: The lack of Hana in the novel. She is mentioned one or twice, but isn't present, which suck because we just gotten to know her a little bit better from reading Hana (Oliver's novella).<br /><br />So many questions. But you'll definitely love this one. I think I actually love this one better than Delirium because Lena is more like Katniss from the Hunger Games, whereas in Delirium I think she was like Bella from Twilight.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game continues to freeze on ICS and you have to bomb out to quit. Developer won't fix it. Have had this phone for months now and still nothing. Have also experienced the lost progression bug. Sad excuse for a game.
B007JF87VS|5.0|They did it again I was so not expecting the way this turned out but it was a real shocker and a great episode, I wish Carl would grow up faster though he really cause alot of greif, and Laurie should shut up should have been her instead of Shane that got it.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Reaction to WRECKING BALL will doubtless be coloured by the listener's preconceived notions of what a \\"Bruce Springsteen record\\" should sound like. Advance word on Springsteen's 17th studio album was that it was an \\"angry rock record,\\" but \\"a collection of angry Celtic folk songs\\" would be a more apt description of what was actually delivered. While I may not share Bruce's passion for raucous Irish pub songs, I can still appreciate the quality of the work, which, with one or two exceptions, is fairly high. Of the new compositions, I find the bluesy, slowly smoldering \\"You've Got It\\" to be the track I'm most drawn to; a throwback to the classic Springsteen sound of \\"Fire,\\" it's easily the most straight ahead rock song to be found here, which is why it feels so out of place amidst the surrounding material. This is an album full of anthems (\\"Shackled and Drawn,\\" \\"Death to My Hometown,\\" the would-be hit \\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" which, following a truly exciting opening, falls strangely flat), but again, with the exception of the leadoff track, these are Celtic-sounding protest anthems, not rock anthems, and it falls to the listener to embrace the record for what it is or reject it for what it isn't. At the very least, there's no \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" working against its favour...
B007JF87VS|1.0|i want to start by saying the first season and this one for the most part have been pretty entertaining (im giving this episode a one star cause it let me down). killing off shane was a big mistake for this show. i don't see this show going much past season 2. 90 percent of this shows drama was just eliminated in the two most recent episodes (with the deaths of shane an dale)...I don't see how this show is going to be as enteraining as it has been ill give season 3 (if there is one) a chance but my hopes are not too high.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Wow, lots of twist and turns keeps you from putting down this story! Two kids who grew up together from birth and lived next door to each other, fall in love making life complicated and confusing especially for the girl which leads to tragedy.

B00337KMAA|5.0|In many ways, UP IN THE AIR feels like LOST IN TRANSLATION without the Japanese setting. Characters drift but take comfort in their lack of familial ties, while others flail about, desperate to create them. As a jet-setting lothario who makes his living telling worker bees their jobs no longer exist, George Clooney exudes charm and charisma; we like him even though he's essentially a hitman doing the dirty work of corporate C.E.O.'s. As with TRANSLATION, the outcome is cloudy but never really in doubt. Aided by an impeccable supporting cast that includes Anna Kendrick and the always-reliable J.K. Simmons, UP IN THE AIR should be considered among the front-runners for the year's best movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OMG! I bought this video thursday night and did it first thing friday and saturday morning....MY BODY IS KILLING ME, I ACHE ALL OVER but I swear it I can already see a difference! The best thing about is that Jillian has two workout partners showing a modified easier version (if your someone who never works out like me) and an advanced partner for someone who is up for a challenge.  There super quick, I find the lunges to be the hardest part but I'm Jillian is right when shes says muscles that have never been used are being worked.  I plan on working out this evening again as soon as I get off work even though I'm achy but no pain no gain. Plus, this video was is cheap! So if you can motivate yourself, its costs little and takes only 20minutes a day of your time!
B003XQM2YU|4.0|I thought the twist on the whole Robin Hood stories was excellent  Russell Crowe was great this is the type of movie he is great in.Nothing at all like your mothers Robin Hood!!
B005HSL626|5.0|Well, this game is extremely fun, many games are fun at first, but then get boring. But this app never gets boring, you can play it again and again and again. The only thing is, I was playing it just fine, then the next time I pressed on it, it returned right back to my app library. I tried it again with the app store but it went right back to the app store. Hopefully that doesn't happen to you. Anyway, this is a very good, fun, game.

B004KZDV8E|5.0|I've read excellent reviews about this processor from multiple websites and I can attest that these reviews are true!  The i3-2120 is indeed an excellent processor for its price, and considering it is only $5 more than the 2100, the 200mhz higher clock speed is well worth the upgrade.<br /><br />I bought this to build a budget gaming rig for my kids and I'm about to order another for a HTPC.  This little chip can run Modern Warfare 3 with no problems, and I also run Photoshop CS4 and Autocad 2011 from time to time with no issues.  My only gripe is, it should have been equipped with HD3000, but I still rate it 5 stars.<br /><br />2 cores, 4 threads, good built-in video graphics, and faster than my old i5 laptop!  This chip is probably the most underrated of all processors right now.

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I am a big fan of cut the rope and I was so happy when this came out. I downloaded it right away and I love it. In my opinion it is a bigger challenge than cut the rope regular. It plays great on the kindle fire, I am having so much fun with it. I highly recommend it!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This works for me.  I wanted something that I could use to read in bed or while riding in the car so I wouldn't have to hold on to my Kindle.  Once in awhile it slips if I move around a bit, but I like it.  It was a little pricey, but I didn't see many options.
B004HO6I2E|4.0|I don't like the changing body story lines. It's been done so much! A friend told me this was really funny so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did! Really funny! As for the humor, you must be ok with the immature, raunchy, bad language type of humor. If you aren't, don't bother. This is definitely a movie made for men mostly. Both married & single men will be able to relate. I'm a woman but love this type of humor and was laughing out loud. Great movie for when you just want to kick back & laugh!

B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game either doesn't load and freezes or it gets to the start screen and freezes with the music still playing.<br /><br />I have a Samsung Nexus so it should be enough to play the game.<br /><br />I will re-download it when I'm near wifi and see if that fixes it and adjust my review if it does.
B007JRUCGO|1.0|Simply awful. Pure torture for any adult forced to watch it.  The first Happy Feet was delightful.  This sequel was a nightmare.
0439023521|5.0|I (twenty-eight years old) could not put this book down. It is not for young readers only, but for anyone who can open a book! After starting, you get so involved with the characters and the world that when you close your eyes you are immidiately taken into their world. There is not too much going on that you get lost, but enough side plots and mini stories that teach you who the people are and build the story. Read the Hunger Games (trilogy) and let your imagination run wild!
B004T0E2S8|1.0|this is seriously pretty terrible, i was expecting pro and all, but i find the database limited to the stuff on the ug site, and guitar tapp is a little cheaper plus it plays songs a little, so u can hear it<br /> this app would've been way better had it be cheaper and have ultimate guitar stop being so stuck up with their database
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to manipulate the cards with the touchpad,making the game as real as possible. I need glasses for most things but the cards are big enough to play without them. Fun game to have along any place I have a few minutes to kill.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|you are missing a good,challenging, and somewhat aggravating game...(no wonder it has ANGRY in its title) amazingly well thought through.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|This is the prequel to the 1982 classic horror movie of the same name.  A group of Norwegian and American researchers in Antarctica discover a buried alien spacecraft.  Not far away is an alien body entombed in ice.  They take the body back to their camp, and soon discover that the alien is not only alive, but extremely dangerous.<br /><br />  The Thing has the ability to shape-shift and infect other living beings, taking them over on a cellular level.  Once taken over, a person will still look, act, and speak the same... until he decides it's time to sprout tentacles and attack.<br /><br />  A good horror movie is more than just gore -- there's suspense.  Who's been infected?  How can you tell?  The researchers must figure this out and stop the Thing before it reaches civilization.<br /><br />  I'm a member of the generation that saw \\"The Thing\\" in 1982 at too young an age.  I had nightmares for weeks.  We've all been waiting for \\"The Thing 2\\" for a long time, and this film delivers.<br /><br />  The producers deserve credit for being so faithful to the John Carpenter movie.  Often sequels and prequels are decried by fans because the writers go off in \\"new directions\\".  (Look what happened to \\"Doom\\" and the \\"Highlander\\" sequels, for example.)<br /><br />  No, for this movie they studied the Norwegian camp as it was shown in the Carpenter film, and meticulously depicted how every little detail came to be -- right down to the axe in the wall!  And they made the movie end right where the previous one starts.<br /><br />  While the film has parallels to the 1982 movie, it adds new material as well.  The researchers discover more about what the Thing can and can't do, and they see the alien spacecraft in more detail.<br /><br />  Many reviewers complained that there was too much CGI in the film.  If you watch some of the \\"Making of\\" bonus material, you'll see that there was not as much CGI as you may think.  The creatures' bodies were made of good ol' foam rubber and puppetry.  CGI was only used to create difficult limb movements, tentacles, and transformations.  The \\"problem\\" was that the puppetry was so good, it was hard to tell where it ended and the CGI began.<br /><br />  The one problem this movie could not surmount is that they didn't have Kurt Russell.  Mary Winstead does her best in the leading role, but she lacks the toughness of a Sigourney Weaver.  Hey, not everyone can pull off a convincing fight against infectious aliens in an enclosed space.<br /><br />  The Thing 2011 is faithful to the 1982 movie, but also holds new surprises.  If you're a fan of the Carpenter flick, you should definitely see this.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Did not realize how huge this is.  Those are 120mm case fans.  Bigger is probably better on a product like this - as long as it fits into your case my mid-tower was fine, but a mini-tower would be too narrow.  Product seems quite good, though it's not easy to install the first time (maybe that was just me, but lining up the expanding brace with the screw holes was not simple and took repeated attempts).  The instructions could be a little more explicit but are adequate.  I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because the pictures show fans on both sides - and attachments are given for a second fan - but only one fan is included.  It looks like you can get by with only one fan, but it's still a bit misleading.  Overall, however, it's a good buy here at Amazon.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I just came home from my son's home after viewing this on my son's home theater.<br />It was my turn to pick a film and this was my pick !<br /><br />My son has never seen a musical and wouldn't have seen this in a million years.<br />Guess what !  He loved it !<br /><br />I feel like I just came from an actual musical. It was so delightful in every way !<br />I loved the cast,they were just great. I can't come up with anything negative.<br />The close up of their faces showed more than you would ever see even from second row !<br /><br />The thrill of seeing the other casts was just tremendous. I am still tingling from this magnificent show.<br />The sound was great,you could actually get it that the building is round. I saw the Royal Albert Hall as a tourist, but was<br />never in side.<br /><br />Again,if you enjoyed the movie,and music of the Phantom,like I do..just think,this is the entire musical !!<br />It was way beyond what I expected. I feel like I went to the Musical,I was there !
B005K0HDGE|5.0|*sigh*... I'm so upset that it's over... You got me at the ending there, Stephen. You really, truly got me. What can I possibly say about this wonderful, beautiful book? That it's wonderful and beautiful? No. That's no where near enough praise. This book made it up to my top 3 favorites list by King (placing at #3) and is probably my favorite book of 2011 (if not tied with Shutter Island). Reading this book, I was so worried about what the ending would be (because, let's be honest here, we know King isn't the best at handling endings... Exhibit A: Under the Dome), and I had a really strong feeling I knew what the ending would be, but that ending was just absolutely amazing... It left everything wrapped up nicely, and was one of his better endings, if not his best (or at least my favorite, even though it's not wrapped up with a pretty bow). The last chapter made me grin ear to ear, but then it left me feeling sad beyond words can describe. To be honest, after I turned the last page (or better yet, clicked, since I own a Kindle), I just sat there and bawled my eyes out, to the point where my husband got worried about me. Yeah... It was that sad. The characters in this book couldn't be better, and I really, truly mean that. I loved every single character (with the exception of Lee Harvey Oswald... Poor Marina...). I loved George/Jake's students, I loved George/Jake, I loved Sadie, I loved Miz Mimi, and much more. I also really liked the purpose of the character the Card Man, even for the very short time he was in the book (I would have liked King to expand a bit more on that, but hey, the book's almost 1000 pages), but the real star in this book was the relationship between George/Jake and Sadie. Their love for each other was undeniable and irrevocable, and just so darn beautiful. Who would have thought that the Stephen King we all know and love (at least I know and love him) could write a beautiful and touching romance alongside a thriller. That was a great shock, andI hope he incorporates this skill of weaving a good relationship into a lot more of his books to come. Being a huge King fan, I couldn't wait for this book to come out. But, in all fairness, I didn't expect to love it. I thought it would be average, maybe even \\"just okay\\", but let me tell you... I really, really loved this book.<br /><br />And if you aren't a King fan, please (pretty please) don't let that stop you from reading this book. This book has absolutely no scary parts, for those of you who abstain from reading Stephen King's books because they are classified as horror, and, like I mentioned earlier on in this review, I actually cried at the end of the book (the first time that I've ever cried while reading a King novel). You can tell that Stephen King put a lot of effort into writing 11/22/63, and his details of life in the late 50's and early 60's really made me wish I was alive then. So, please, even if you don't like Stephen King, read this! It's an absolutely beautiful book, and one I wish I can read for the first time all over again.<br /><br />And if you're still not convinced to read this, would it help if I told you that there's.... Poundcake? ;)<br /><br />PS: You will probably want a box of tissues handy towards the end. And if you're listening to the audiobook, maybe two boxes.<br /><br />For those wondering, these are my top 3 favorite King books:<br /><br />#1: It<br />#2: The Shining<br />#3: (this may shock some people...) previously The Stand. Now it's 11/22/63<br /><br />\\"If there is love, smallpox scars are as pretty as dimples. I'll love your face no matter what is looks like. Because it's yours\\"<br /><br />\\"The past is obdurate for the same reason a turtle's shell is obdurate: because the living flesh inside is tender and defenseless\\"<br /><br />\\"Home is watching the moon rise over the open, sleeping land and having someone you can call to the window, so you can look together. Home is where you dance with others, and dancing is life.\\"<br /><br />\\"For a moment everything was clear, and when that happens you see that the world is barely there at all. Don't we all secretly know this? It's a perfectly balanced mechanism of shouts and echoes pretending to be wheels and cogs, a dreamclock chiming beneath a mystery-glass we call life. Behind it? Below it and around it? Chaos, storms. Men with hammers, men with knives, men with guns. Women who twist what they cannot dominate and belittle what they cannot understand. A universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where mortals dance in defiance of the dark.\\"

0439023513|4.0|I've waited awhile to review this, to see if my utter disappointment in the last book changed any; and it has a bit. When I look at this last installment as the absolute truth of what happens in war - to innocents, to values, to countries, to soldiers, to citizens and lands - I can understand the pathos and indifference and seeming nonchalance in the killing. I can understand how Katniss' reactions or lack thereof are seemingly not explained - this is the numbness and emptiness left after the horror of war.<br /><br />However, in a novel that was supposed to be for YA audiences, I find myself still disappointed in the lack of redemption or feeling or explanation of \\"life after\\"; the indiscriminate killing off of characters (this isn't Game of Thrones) and lack of tying up of loose ends.<br /><br />I get it, and yet I don't. I'm disappointed, and yet I felt I had to read it after investing the time into reading the first two. Maybe I'll go back and read it again after some time has passed. Then again, maybe the movie will redeem it. I'd give it 3 stars, but I still feel fairly sure there must be something *I*, as a reader, just am not getting about this last book; so giving the author the benefit of the doubt. She did create a unique world. I'm just not sure this last book did it justice.
B00475BUVM|4.0|Great action and effects.  Different take on the Homer book than from the original movie but still a good story.
B0071QIN00|1.0|too hard! not playable at all. maybe because I'm using Asus transformer tablet. the dude dies at any simple hit no level to select easy,medium,hard and every time he dies it goes all the way back to the beginning? very very difficult and I love the game, been playing something similar since windows mobile 5.0!
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|This movie regressed back to what the first movie was with a sappy, very cheesy, love story that is really boring.  Hopefully the next one will get back to the fighting and action.  That is the main reason, I personally, prefer the Underworld series to this series.  Less love story.  More action!!!!  I would give this movie .25 of a star if I could.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This is not compatible with the Iconia Tab a200 running ICS. Game constantly freezes; start back up and you can get one tap further - then it locks up again. Extremely frustrating and completely unplayable.<br /><br />Works OK on Droid Razr.
0142437611|4.0|I was surprised at just how much I ended up empathizing with Tommy Wilhelm. I didn't want to like him or his mid-life crisis breakdown. But there is an odd sort of universality about him that I can't quite pin down. On one level he deserves everything he's gotten for being so reckless. But on another he obviously has to deal with some pretty unfair, screwed up stuff. The relationship with his father and their interactions are just searing to read, Dr. Adler is a total prick. The dialogue here is what stands out most for me. You can imagine actual people talking to each other this way in 1950's New York. In some ways it kind of reminds me of Mrs. Dalloway, with everything constrained to a single day, but we still move back and forth through a character's life at will.
B003JTHS5E|5.0|This book is a must read for all couples. It discusses how each individual may perceive love in different ways and how to act in a way our spouse knows that they are loved and supported.  Very well written book.
037571457X|4.0|Oh dear. Issues of post-colonial modernity? An examination of the role of women in a Muslim society? A tale of youthful rebellion against theocratic rigidity? A parable of how the personal and the political often tragically intertwine? It's got all that and more, and it's a comic?! I don't think its possible to not like this book. I can see this becoming the new \\"Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\\" for the college book club set. It is a genuinely touching piece of work. It will probably appear on survey's of world literature and post colonial studies syllabi for years to come.

0439023513|2.0|I'm no literary agent.  I dream of being a writer- dream.  When I dove into Hunger Games and Catching Fire I though someone who could write such a unique work and delicious reading inspires me!  I was immersed into a world of imagination being pulled along by the desire to know what would happen next in the life of Katniss.  I had heard it was related to a message about war, frankly, I didn't necessarily see it that way.  I found the Capitol, a place to be despised, the catalyst for terrible things.  Katniss a pragmatist who loved her family and was on the cusp of young love.  HG and CF were glorious reads, exciting, twisted turns, gorgeous character development, visual descriptions for consumption, just a great read!  And now I am left scratching my head, thinking this author fell out of love with writing, had a deadline she couldn't quite meet because one of her children was sick and needed her attention, the 'fire' if you will that was burning in the first two books was sprayed out when we find Katniss in District 13.  It was as far underground as that District and as drab as their uniforms.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|I haven't heard a more talented band like this one and this good in about ten years.  It doesn't hurt that the lead singer Nate Ruess has some serious interesting pipes.  The lyrics speak so eloquently about what the new generation really feels about this crumbling world.  They almost convincing enough that you start to believe they it really is true.  They're the ones that change everything for the better.  This band displays how much they love and appreciate music.  There is some major creativity going on here to produce such infectious rock.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Definitely more than mathematical computations! I even found detailed weather forecasts and detailed weekly temperature graphs for my city. There are several uses with this app. Click.on examples in the menu and go from there. That's what I found the most helpful getting started.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app. it is available in the NIV which most dont have... or others charge up to $30 for similar application.  thank so much.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|This movie has a wonderful and fully devloped story that reveals itself slowly during the first part of the film.  It is filled with family drama, sexual tension, and one mans deep love for his family when he knows he is dying.  Well worth the long movie time, and being dubbed in English (I am American and don't speak Danish).  I am still thinking about it today, after watching it yesterday evening.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|nice thing about e.n. is that it is available for just about every device.  I use it on my kindle and macbook and share notes with my husband's playbooks.  too bad we cant edit each others notes with going premium. I love using e.n. because I can easily share my ideas with others, including documents from Ms office.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used it as a substitute for onenote. it lacks some features of onenote,  such as the ability to drop text boxes anywhere, but more than makes up by being available and synched on my iphone, kindle, Pc a<br />d browser.

B004LLDN3A|5.0|First, I was thrilled to learn that I could rent Mary Poppins from amazon. My 5-year-old grandson wanted to see it (I had told him my sister and I had seen it when we were young multiple times). I'd gone to two local libraries, to no avail. So, for almost nothing, Christian and I rented Mary Poppins and had a supercalifragilistically good time!! Thanks amazon.
B006YTYIXG|5.0|I pre-ordered this album, knowing I would like it, hoping I would love it... Well, I love it! The new drummer is awesome. Soulfly and Cavalera Conspiracy are probably the top two bands I actually look forward to new material from because it's Heavy, Brutal, melodic and creative. Marc Rizzo is a badass guitar player, and Max pretty much just has the Metal Midas touch I guess you could say. The last Soulfly album was pretty good, very brutal and straight forward, this one breathes a bit, like the last CC album \\"Blunt Force Trauma\\" which has been a favorite record of mine since it came out... So I'll say, if you liked the last CC album, and like Soulfly, You'll love this album!! BUY IT!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|THough it can't be read without the other two, and the other two are great, this is by far the best. I don't understand why the books are marketed to kids. I can see high school but they are too adult fot younger than that. I know many young kids who have read them and it concerns me. Especially when I talk to them about it and they are mmore insterested in the violence then the causes and probles with it. Even the characters are more concerned about there nation's lack of compassion than many of the readers I have heard from.
B005A68HRC|5.0|Love all the songs in this album! If you have to choose one Maroon 5 album to buy, this is the one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book. Kept me interested to read the whole series but enjoyed the other two far more. All three were terrific reads
B004LWZWC4|5.0|A friend of mine rented this movie, and, as soon as the credits were done rolling, I purchased my own copy. It is simply a delight! One of the best movies I've seen this year. If you enjoy movies about personal growth and/or that have any of the following: birding, nature, traveling, laughter, competitions, or if you just want to be entertained then give this a chance. I won't go more into detail here about it as plenty of other reviewers have done that already, just watch it!<br /><br />I do want to highly recommend the bluray 2-disc set as it includes the extended version narrated slightly differently by John Cleese (on the bluray disc in the extras section), which is as enjoyable if not moreso than the theatrical version narrated by Jack Black. The extended version also has a gag reel and some other fun behind-the-scenes extras about the locations to which the production crew and cast traveled, and there is one more very small character's story woven in to the extended version of the movie...that of a ruby-throated hummingbird. The ruby's story is laced throughout the movie, and I think it adds a little extra bit of birding fun and fullness to the overall feel of the film. It's just really sweet.<br /><br />Overall, see this movie, theatrical or extended version - both are great!
B002WY65W4|4.0|Believe it or not, this is the first Blu Ray movie I have ever bought. Most times I'd rather rent them as I live in a small apartment and space is precious. I watched this movie on the big screen and thoroughly enjoyed it, enough that I actually bought it. There is a good mix of humour and comedy here and although some may dismiss this movie as fluff it's worth a second and third viewing. The make-up effects are very good, just the right amount of decomposing flesh and slimy remains. This is a must watch when you have the guys come over because the misus don't approve of you going out with them.<br /><br />The downside... there's very little, maybe none. There quite a bit of bonus material provided. The usual deleted scenes and commentaries, a few interviews and a short behind the scenes potion. It's nothing groundbreaking but I'm not really into such things anyway. Picture quality is great and sound effects are true to the theatrical release.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games was an easy book to get into, despite feeling a little bit disoriented, trying to figure out what \\"harvest day\\" meant and such, but there wasn't a bit of boringness to be had. Katniss Everdeen is a complex character that I was never able to totally love, but she enthralled me and made me listen to her story. Haymitch says it best when he tells Katniss she has the \\"appeal of a slug.\\" Still, despite obviously not being a charismatic character, there is something about Katniss that draws the reader in and gets them stuck in this world of Panem. I assume anyone brought up in such circumstances would make you want to take a few steps backwards when meeting them. One character that I genuinely  loved was Haymitch Abernathy. I absolutely adored his snarky commentary and the comical scenes he's in. I also liked a few of Gale's lines in the beginning, though I can't say I totally fell for him as so many others did.<br /><br />Also, I totally loved the ending of the book. Perfect.<br /><br />One final note on the what I loved section. Those of you who have read most of my reviews may have caught onto a certain masochistic tendency to my reading tastes. I love books that infuriate me. I love books that jerk my emotions from one extreme to another. The Hunger Games is no exception to this rule. Shortly after I found out just what the Hunger Games are, and definitely as I read The Hunger Games, I was totally consumed by a hate for the government of Panem. I could barely breathe through my teeth that any society-fictional or not- would do such a thing to it's citizens. And while it doesn't effect me personally in the United States, the truth is that, while not to the same extent as the Hunger Games takes it, children's lives are sacrificed all the time in other countries without a thought. This thought ate at me. And, by some weird twist of brain chemistry, caused me to have to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />Despite the characters being at a distance to me, this book is still phenomenal. And again, I think that when you look at the world in which The Hunger Games takes place, it's completely understanding why the characters would seem so distant. I can't quite explain why this is, but The Hunger Games is definitely in my \\"top favorite books\\" list. The story itself is completely consuming, especially after the Hunger Games have started. If you are one of the few who have yet to read The Hunger Games, I highly advise getting ahold of it and reading Katniss's story for yourselfme, this book is still phenomenal.

078693123X|4.0|GREETINGS GALACTIC SURFERS! This is quite a departure for your beloved reviewer so awayyyy we gooo! I first read about this feller in the pages of his IDW comic book and I was looking for the latest issue of it at The MoosE Cave here in SHOW LOW, and Mike the owner and proprietor of the afore mentioned  establishment lent me his copy of this and the 1st ICE WIND TRILOGY book as well. Now I am not a big fantasy fan, with the exceptions of comic books, Thomas Covenant, Middle Earth, and Humourous (ie the Mythverse,Disc World, and the like), but I did not want to come accross as a NUKENERD (i.e. An ungreatful know it all jerk) , so I graciously said I would give it a try. What a fun read I am glad I did! I was transported by the prologue to a place I have never been where islamofacism, feminazism, and the Baron Harkonen colide and mutate into an overtly evil New Age Religion mutation. This truly is a world I have never been to before, what a feast for the mind. There are blank spots where the readers imagination

The chapter end with appropiate cliff hangers and the books end was not disappointing like many other book series (i.e. Twilight series).

B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I love these guys they just fit in with having all kinds of music for my collection of moods. I like buying from Amazon because I also rely on moods to shop for new music. Having it right here at my finger tips is perfect for that. I also like being able to listen to bits and pieces especially on a new artist I have never purchsed before. The shipments are always timely and in good condition.

B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I have been a follower of Susan Tedeschi for years. She is awesome. I heard from people who know me that I would love Trucks as well. I no every word to this CD and can never get enough of it. I cann't wait for their next one. I have turned several people onto them as well.
0439023521|5.0|A beautiful gripping read. I could not put it down. I read all three books in a little over a week and now I feel empty.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I surprised myself with this one. I don't buy country music. I love bluegrass and country rock but I loved hearing them on the Grammy's so I took the chance. I did not buy a new one and the case was all cracked. No real biggy I only file them away and put the CD's in a changer. I love to listen to this band. I actually listen to the entire CD (not normal for a country CD). She is a real spirited singer and the band is really good. I will probably listen to bits and pieces of their next one before purchasing, but don't anticipate I won't like them again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that you can choose to have it read to you out loud. they really thought of everything! 5 stars
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|Like a horror film where the dead guy keeps coming back to life, you FINALLY get to the point where the guy gets his wife back and it falls apart again.  Should have stopped watching way before this.  Because the horror is I wasted two hours of my life watching this half-heartedly acted, insipid, predictable movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so easy for me to go through my day &quot;forgetting&quot; that I need the living water of God's Word to hydrate my soul.  This app reminds me to come to the well.  Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I just returned this book.  I made it through about 60% through when I found I just couldn't stand any more.  Honestly, it gave me nightmares.  Just the thought that a young inexperienced girl just out of college would get herself into a situation where the ONLY priority in her life was sex, where the ONLY sex is BDSM, was terrifying.  Granted, the author does grab you and pull you along, and you are hoping against hope that things will turn out all right for Anastasia in the end and that she will somehow manage to reform Christian or heal his inner demons or something.  But ultimately I was more repelled than attracted.  I'm relieved that I won't see it on my Kindle any more. If I could have given it no stars, I would have.

B005C0DHEY|5.0|The Kony campaign gets over fifty million views in less than a week; if the intent is to build public support and pressure policy makers,  then keeping this film and the \\"Gasland\\" brand a commercial concern is akin to drinking the poison water they protest.  Gasland community needs to get this film out and on the lips of as many people as they possibly can; change is a numbers game. If enough people gather change happens.
1451683405|4.0|A brilliant book written by a brilliant man. Free Will will certainly make you (or the thing you think is \\"you\\") think twice about your assumptions of free will and selfhood. Not only is there no \\"ghost in the machine\\", but the illusion of free will is itself an illusion (brilliant!).<br /><br />While I immensely loved this book, there were parts where I wished he had gone into a bit deeper detail. Granted, the book is less than 70 pages long, so I'm sure Harris had to intentionally forego many details in many places. Harris is a personal hero of mine and I devour almost everything he produces; and, while I'd love to give 5 stars to everything he does, I'll have to give this book 4 stars. (Keep in mind Harris sets the bar so high that a 4 stars for Harris is a 10 stars for any other mere mortal author).
B005QMOZOO|2.0|I have read all of PD James' previous books and enjoyed them immensely. However this book failed to engage my interest and in fact I found it boring, Perhaps I was expecting too much. A marriage made in heaven {Austen and James}. I found the characters bland and the writing trite. Perhaps James was trying to play it safe with regard to Austen fans but in fact she has written one very dull book.
B0058VW36U|1.0|cut the rope experiment is so much funner than this one way runner all I have to say boo to this
B000FC10MU|3.0|I discovered this book while working my way through NPR's top 100 picks in science fiction and fantasy. There were several times when I thought I'd stop reading, never come back, and couldn't imagine why the NPR listeners would put this in the top-10. By the end, I understood.<br /><br />The first ~50% of the book was dark and crude and laboring. I found it really hard to keep going. There was little to keep the reader interested. The characters had potential, but the book just went on and on without direction for so long. At a couple of really crude spots, I was totally turned off and simply stopped. No more. The book isn't worth it. Too long, going nowhere, too crude, just not interesting.<br /><br />My curiosity about why it was in the top-10 of the NPR list brought me back. I just finished the book, and understand better why it's there. The book is unlike anything I've read before. The approach is novel, the execution of the way Gaiman weaves between reality and the world of the gods is interesting. You find yourself traveling threads between characters, gods, and imagery that is somewhat confusing yet holds together just enough to really play out the sense of living between worlds.<br /><br />I applaud Neil Gaiman for taking on such a bold project. It's an interesting work. Yet, I found the overall tone of the characters too dark, demented and crude, and the story was way longer than it needed to be. Check the box, I read book #10 on the list. Move on and never ever read it again.

B006SV2LWA|3.0|Plagues will be with us for a while, medicine has a long ways to go. So kudos for making a movie on the topic, kudos for covering most of the bases, kudos for using good actors and getting them to deliver largely very good performances.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the movie has a bit of a documentary feel; it is just a bit like reading a spreadsheet with some human touches added. It is an interesting approach to give views from different perspectives, but as a story it is a bit sterile.<br /><br />Compare with the original Night of the Living Dead: information about the plague is still conveyed, via radio broadcasts and humans telling stories; but the view is very much from people who don't know what is going on, and have No Way Out. That central inescapable fear is sadly missing from this otherwise very competent movie.

0891419195|5.0|This is hands down the best combat oral history ever written.Dr.Sledge tells of his experiences on Peleliu and Okinawa,written from the diary he kept during these island battles.He is proud to be a Marine but there is no sugar coating of the horrors of combat.His family had originally encouraged him to write the book as a catharsis to help with his PTSS but it turned into the best first hand account of the Pacific fighting ever written.He was an extraordinary man and I wish I could have met him before he died.Five stars is not a high enough rating for this book.

B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was a very good read and kept my interest until the end.  This is the third book in a series.  I read this book second before I discovered that there was a second book in the series I should have read.  I am now reading the second book and I am enjoying it very much even though I know the final outcome of the characters.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|John Hiatt is a treasured songwriter, a great musician, and his songs ring true, clean and always powerful.  This is as strong an album as he has ever put out.  I put it right there with Crossing Muddy Waters as his two finest moments for me.  He never sits still either, as this album is mixed loud and rocking and bluesy.  Pretty much the way his concerts go--when he has a band with him.  Hopefully he will tour with a full band around here sometime.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was very suspensful and held my attention to the end.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys murder mistories.  I found there are three books in the series.  I found that I did not read them in order thus when I read the third book I found I new the final outcome of the characters from book three.  I think if would be helpful if the books were identified as to the sequence of the books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very fun app. it's fun trying to get points to unlock more games. I was surprised that there are so many games for a free app.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book held my interest to the end.  I enjoyed the authors writing style.  The suspence was there until the end.  I would recommend this book to every one who enjoys murder mistories with a lot of twists and turns in the story line.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|I purchased the BU-353 at Amazon to use with my Panasonic Toughbook and Microsoft Streets & Trips 2011.  I have had it for about a week.  I mounted the receiver on my trunk lid and it worked well--similar to what other reviews stated.  Well, until it rained.  Within 3 minutes after the steady rain started, it quit working.  After drying it off, and putting it in the back window (inside the car) it did resume working after about a half hour or so.  I now have it mounted there, but I question if it is working as well (signal wise) as it did when mounted on the trunk lid.<br /><br />I caution anyone who intends to mount this externally.  There are screws holding the case together, and the wire has a stress grommet that does not look waterproof.  Not sure if the moisture got in the screw holes or the wire hole.<br /><br />Very disappointed in the product.  It should not be marketed as waterproof.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm really going to miss this trilogy! Such a great ending that left me craving more of the world of Christian and Ana. So much positive emotion, love and trust has developed between them. They are both \\"Freed\\" from a possible disastrous future to finally be happy and content in a way neither ever dreamed of.<br /><br />Again E L James' writing makes you feel every possible emotion with another page turner that I would gladly lose sleep over again!<br /><br />I really want more of Ana and Christian and am very sad to see them go (sigh).
B0072X2O66|4.0|I see a lot of negative reviews and all seem to be wanting a Dream Theater or Symphony X esque album...You're not getting it here...This is different and a good straight forward rock album with rockers and ballads...I'm a big DT fan and a casual Symphony fan...From beginning to end the album does it for me.Undaunted,Psychosane,Indifferent,All In The Line,Feelin Me,Come Undone(Duran Duran cover),Believe Me and Angel Sky are my faves from the album...If you're a rock fan and not going to compare this album to DT or Symphony,it is for you...get it now,you won't regret.  Rock on!!!!  \m/
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great continuation from book 1! We all get to know more about fifty and what brings him to his ways. He seems to change some in this book and most is positive. He opens up a bit more to Ana and realizes he is being accepted in a way he never thought possible.<br /><br />I love all of the humor in between everything else that goes on in the book! It really adds to the story and lightens up some of the extreme intensity that is felt in certain situations between Ana and Fifty. All in all an excellent read that grabs you and does not let go until your are at the end. Actually I find myself still lodged in Ana and Christian's world. Cannot wait to sink my eyes into book 3!
0345410025|5.0|I bought this in Junior High School and have since purchased several more copies to give as gifts and share with my children. This book has helped me maintain high GPAs since my first reading as a child and through college and now is helping my teen son in Pre-Med (Gordon started Pre-Med at 13 years old). He used t methods in this book to get 100% grades in Geography as I did when I was his age.<br /><br />  I have over 15 Memory improvement books from various authors and our family agrees that this one IS One of the Best!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I downloaded this so I could have access to the Kindle library on my new Asus Transformer pad. I have to say I prefer the Google App Store, now called the Play Store reader. I'm sure the Kindle runs things just fine, but on my droid tablet I can't get two pages on the screen in the manner of paper books like I can with the droid app. The bookmarking bar and chapter bar tend to get in the way instead of fading neatly out of sight when not in use.<br /><br />Again I must say that the app probably works beautifully for the Kindle and it does work on my droid, just not as neatly as the Google app.  But for the moment, the Kindle store has some titles that I can't get in the Play store so I am glad the Kindle app only has some minor annoyances and works well enough to let me read some of my favorites.
B00536OCYG|5.0|I've owned Pink Floyd \\"The Wall\\" on cassette, early vinyl, CD, and now this heavy vinyl reissue.  It is my favorite rock album overall.  I remember purchasing this record on cassette when it first came out.  After listening to it all the way through for the first time in 1980, it was clear to me that it was and is an extraordinary classic, arguably PF's greatest album.  This is PF's most fully realized album with so much happening both musically and lyrically that it challenges you to listen and understand the powerful concept and all of the tragedy that feeds into it.  I remember being 16 years old when it was first released and digging into the lyrics to understand their message.  It was then and some 30 odd years later it still is an emotionally powerful album.  \\"The Wall\\" just doesn't succeed as a rock album; it succeeds as a true work of art.  It is like a Shakespeare tragedy that's not designed to make us happy, but to help us learn from life's sufferings on both an historical level and on a personal level.  Don't we all build walls in our lives in some way?  The message of \\"The Wall\\" is to break down the walls that prevent us from being truly happy people.<br /><br />You're probably more interested in the reissue rather than my musings about the album's art.  It's a very nice 180 gram pressing that was remastered by James Guthrie, who was one of the original people who worked on \\"The Wall\\".  The source tapes were used.  The remaster is excellent, and it sounds good right out of the jacket.  I cleaned the visually perfect records with a VPI wet/vac RCM, and the sound was illuminated after the cleaning.  I played the records with my classic SONY STR-V5 85 watts/channel clean power receiver with a Technics turntable equipped with a GRADO cartridge through a pair of NHT Classic Three book shelf speakers on stands.  I used the flat response settings.  The sound is rich and full, yet it sounds balanced.  I did encounter some noise on Side 3 in some spots, but I'm thinking further RCM cleanings will reduce or eliminate the noise.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice.  The jacket has much of the original artwork and some new artwork on the back.  It comes with a big 32\\"x38\\" poster that has all of the album's lyrics with the white brick wall in the background.  You also receive a card with a code to complete a free MP3 download of the entire album.  You get pink poly inner sleeves as well as the original paper sleeves (heavier than the original sleeves) with the lyrics on them that came with the original vinyl release.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent reissue.  Some have complained about the price.  Great music will command a higher price, and we're talking about one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  Whether or not what's in this package is worth it to you will depend on your own personal standards.  If this album means as much to you as it does to me, you will have to have it, and remember, \\"...the ones who really love you walk up and down outside the wall...\\".
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I never expected to get sucked in (NO pun intended) with the Twilight series. But boredom led me to the movies which proved to be pretty good. After watching part 1 of the movie Breaking Dawn I bought my first Twilight book. I was totally and very pleasantly surprised. You see I deal with Indie authors who publish on Amazon and they are all convinced that all they have to do is write a vamp romance and they'll be rich. So I was expecting a fast, unsatisfying, light weight read.<br /><br />But Stephanie Myers does what a good writer is supposed to do. She wrote an engaging story and populated it with characters I can like. I kept turning pages because I wanted to find out what happens next. I could cheer the heroes and hold my breath as the bad guys got what was coming to them. And when I finished the book I felt satisfied. I can now see why this series has been such a success. And I hope to see the story continue because I want to know what happens next. Will the choice be the steadfast wolf, or the jungle dwelling stranger? Will Edward and Bella become pawns in the simmering feud between vampire groups?<br /><br />A good author leaves you wanting to know more, and Stephanie Meyers is a good author who neatly tied up one saga while opening the door to more.
B007H7XJD4|3.0|All in all it was ok. Storyline could be improved, but it's a movie about a nobody rising up to be somebody playing off of greek mythology. It reminded me of like hercules meets 300. I wanted a better ending, but for all who are movie buff and have 2 hours to kill. IT's definiltey action packed (most of the time), has some really cool scenery/ graphics and they also show the girl from \\"slumdog millionaire\\" naked from her backside. Godbless<br /><br />~shaun's movie review

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|OfficeSuite is currently the best office app for Android platform, in my opinion. I tried several different apps, and OfficeSuite was the one with the best international characters support, and one of the most intuitive UIs. The only issue I had with it was creating new documents with righ to left text direction (Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew text). OfficeSuite can edit right to left documents but has no means to create them. The workaround is to create an empty right to left document in your computer, and whenever you need to create a new right to left document in OfficeSuite, just open that empty document and type your text, then save the document with a new name.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|I originally had concerns that the digital copy would be missing or already used. After receiving the product and noticing the factory packaging, I was not surprised to find all digital copy codes were in working order. The shipping was also amazingly fast. Great product and great seller.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but once I read the sample I was hooked!  Great characters, interesting story line.  This is one of those books that you think about while you're not reading it.  I highly reccomend this series and am looking forward to more!
B006S009IY|1.0|This movie should have been called \\"Finding Fantasyland,\\" since its only resemblance to the true story of J.M. Barrie and his relationship with the Llewellyn Davies children is their names. It's hard to understand what the makers of this movie were trying to accomplish. It begins with Arthur Llewellyn Davies already dead, when in actual fact Barrie had been a friend of the family for over six years when Arthur died, entering the scene before Michael and Nico had been born. By the time Arthur died he was a firm fixture in their lives (\\"Uncle Jimmy\\"), and was able to offer financial assistance to the family immediately upon his death.<br /><br />With such a wealth of information available about Barrie's and the Llewellyn Davies' lives (one such source can be found at jmbarrie.co.uk, the collected documentation in letters and notes written by Barrie and the Llewellyn Davies' themselves, as well as the outstanding book \\"[[ASIN:0300098227 J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys: The Real Story Behind Peter Pan]],\\" by Andrew Birkin), it is difficult to understand why the makers of this movie felt it necessary to fudge the facts. The whole thing seems to be focused on the special relationship between Barrie and Peter, when in fact it was George who had the special relationship with Barrie. The entire movie seems to be conjecture and fantasy.<br /><br />If you are really interested in learning more about the man behind Peter Pan, I highly recommend that you skip this movie and go straight to the Birkin book. And if you really want a \\"movie,\\" then I recommend the docudrama, \\"[[ASIN:B000EWBOD6 The Lost Boys]],\\" a BBC film starring Ian Holm based upon the Andrew Birkin book. The latter is actually rooted in fact.
1451627297|2.0|I'm a sucker for time travel stories. Period. If it's about time travel, I'm there. Having said that, I like Stephen King too. Was a huge fan of his back in the mid 90's. So when I found out one of my favorite authors was writing a book about going back in time to change the future, I was very excited.<br /><br />I won't bore the hell out of you with a long review. There a plenty of long reviews here. I will get straight to the point. Half of this book is simply amazing. The last half is realy boring and bad. And the ending? omg... what was he thinking?<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />so... let me get this straight... the guy saves  JFK... and what's the result? EARTHQUAKES? Huh? What was he thinking? I still don't know if that's a joke or not.<br /><br />The way I see it, the book became terrible when the main character started spying on Oswald. I couldn't stand it. and the ending killed it for me.<br /><br />I don't recommend it.

B00701897I|5.0|The movie is great and this review is not for the movie.  This is for the Digital Copy which seems to be included with this product.<br /><br />Please be aware that the Digital copy will not download to iTunes and you can not use it for your devices, so make sure you remember this when you buy.<br /><br />Hopefully they will fix this.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />3/15/2012 Update<br /><br />My initial review was based on the movie was based on not being able to download the movie to iTunes.  Well that matter has been addressed and I can report that you can indeed download this movie to iTunes.<br /><br />That being said, I have updated this movie since it is a great movie for kids and it reminds me of when I was a kid.<br /><br />Great to have Tin Tin back and I can't wait until the next one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|An easy read because the story is so well told...by the family dog. Not a cutesy story but one that describes the evolution of a family in crisis and their fight to come out the other end with their dreams in tact. The dog's owner (Dad in the story) is a race car driver for a living. He is excellent and in the description of what it takes to be successful and focused on in his profession are life lessons that are poignant and applicable to anyone. You don't have to be a race car driver or a dog lover to enjoy this book and I thoroughly did.
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|Well, my husband liked this movie, probably because he read the comics as a kid.  Me, not so much. IMO, you make a big screen movie, you have to appeal across the board, and this movie didn't do that.  It had a lot of action scenes, which I like, but nothing else.<br /><br />The story was weak, there wasn't any connection between any of his team and none of the characters had any depth to them.  The \\"love interest\\" if you can call her that, was barely there, and they never even had a date.  Really great love story - check that off the list.  Action - too, much, too long, too dull.  All CGI effects that were dull!  Check.  Acting - eh.  I love Tommy Lee Jones but he was all, gruff and nothing else. They didn't give him enough to do with this part.<br /><br />You couldn't care about Captain America because he wasn't more than cardboard, the Red headed villan was the same - idiotic.  Writing - terrible!!  I don't give a damn about the comics; you can't have a, what 5 hour movie - sorry felt like it - 2 hour movie where one of the most interesting characters, the German Scientist gets killed, his best friend dies because of him, and Capt. America crashes in the ice and then he wakes up 70 years later. Everyone you know and loved is dead.  The End.  Huh???<br /><br />I mean, I love Nick Fury, Tony Stark in Ironman & Thor as much as anyone, more probably than most women, and I can't wait for the Avengers movie, but really???  I kept thinking the movie was over, mercifully, then it started up again attacking another facility, having more unnecessary fight/action scenes.  Editing - cut about half of the stuff out.<br /><br />Overall rating - less than 0 if I could rate it that.  Avoid this one and rewatch Ironman 1 & 2, Thor and wait of the Avengers, which I hope will rock!
0061353248|5.0|We are fallible, regardless of what the traditional economists say. That's the book in a nutshell, but Ariely's experiments on the different facets of our fallibility are fascinating. Having read [[ASIN:0374275637 Thinking, Fast and Slow]], I knew a great deal already about some of our issues with being completely rational. Still, Ariely's style is incredibly readable and compelling. Get this book.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|In 1956 Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne) wanted to start off on his own. He was the youngest child of a very successful father and his older brother was already quite successful. Colin wanted to direct and produce movies and his father looked down on that profession. Colin went to London and worked his way, by determination, into a minor job in the crew of an upcoming movie starring Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) and Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh).<br /><br />Colin while working as the Third Assistant Director, a flunky job, has the opportunity to meet Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn is overwhelmed with the job and her lack of confidence and co-dependence on other people for support is killing her acting in the movie. She and Colin strike up a relationship that leads....<br /><br />This is a good story and a well-acted movie based on the book The Prince, The Showgirl and Me by the real Colin Clark. It is an interesting insight into Marilyn Monroe and the issues she had in her life. At thirty years old she was into her 3rd marriage by only a few weeks only to find that her husband Authur Miller (Dougray Scott) already didn't like being married to her and felt that her co-dependency was smothering him. Colin's and Marilyn's friendship and relationship gave her a stabilizing factor in her life at that time and helped her improve her confidence and her performance in the movie.<br /><br />The movie was good and I enjoyed the characters and the story. I believe you will like it also!

B002BWP49C|2.0|Whilst the movie itself is OK. Disc one of this 2 disc SE had a chip out of the centre. I was still able to play this movie, however I know over time this will deteriorate so will not be playing too often.<br />Special Features - not happy that there were no deleted scenes, though the 'making of/special effects' documentary was really interesting.
B004SYP5WC|2.0|anyone else noticed that since installing, you reminders to download other software? like it's ad supported? I thought it was the free app, not the ad supported app....

B0053O89WY|5.0|I am writing my review now, since we are 3/4 through the 5th season of my favorite sitcom. I will update once it wraps. I don't understand why people never want anything to change, especially with the Big Bang Theory. The whole premise of the show is the four geeky guys learning about the world of girls and dating--their universe is expanding, hence the title \\"The Big Bang Theory.\\" There is only so much you can do with 5 people and if they never did anything except sit around and play video games and Klingon Boggle then it would get extremely BORING and everyone would be complaining that the show needs to take on a new direction and add new characters. You would really want to see 5+ seasons of Howard being a perv and all the others failing at life? That's not funny, that's sad! Amy and Bernadette aren't going anywhere anytime soon, so deal with it.<br /><br />Anyway, this season opens up with the aftermath of Raj and Penny's night together, and it isn't what everybody automatically assumed it was, which \\"ruined\\" the show. And even Sheldon decides to take his friendship with Amy to the next level, by offering to be her boyfriend (with strict rules and guidelines that guarantees that nothing changes physically). Howard gets a chance to go into outer space, and when he goes to training camp, we have hysterical (and disgusting) results. And Leonard finally breaks up with Raj's sister Priya, which I am happy about because she wasn't really nice. The only thing I'm concerned about is Penny drinking a lot.<br /><br />This season we also had the 100th episode. I thought it was pretty funny, and some other people thought it was so \\"disappointing.\\"<br /><br />A few of my favorite episodes this season are \\"The Infestation Hypothesis,\\" \\"The Good Guy Fluctuation,\\" \\"The Rhinitis Revelation,\\" \\"The Shiny Trinket Manuever,\\" \\"The Werewolf Transformation,\\" \\"The Launch Acceleration,\\" \\"The Countdown Reflection\\" and \\"The Weekend Vortex.\\"<br /><br />6/13/12 Edit: The season finished on ahigh note with Howard getting married to Bernadette on the roof of the apartment, on the same morning as Google Earth does their satellite image, so they have their wedding captured on Google Earth. And a few days after, he took off to outer space. While everybody was watching the launch on TV, they all grabbed each other's hands. And SHELDON grabbed AMY'S hand. That shows how much he's grown in 5 years. I don't get why people have such a problem with that when it is SUPPOSED to happen.<br /><br />The show has been renewed through season 7, so they must be doing something right.<br /><br />4.5/5 for me! :)
0439023521|5.0|I'm late to the bandwagon, but recently started reading The Hunger Games this past Wednesday, and on Sunday morning I am done with all three books. Love, love love. Now I'm stumped on what else to read.
076790592X|3.0|This is a sad book, but it has an important message about reaching out to people, especially your friends and family.  The author mentions several times his reluctance to cry and his teacher's insistence that doing so was acceptable.  I'll admit that I cried a few times during this book.<br /><br />The story was adapted into a TV movie starring Jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria.  Morrie Schwartz died on November 4, 1995, six-and-a-half weeks before his 79th birthday.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|emma is my favorite jane austen book. im fifteen and have read two other austen novels, pride and predudice and northanger abbey. ill admit that often during the story emma seems selfish and spoiled (and often misuses her sense as mr. knightly once said), but overall her blunders make for a hilarious and wonderful story. ( also i love frank churchill!)
078322611X|2.0|Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) hears voices in his cornfield, \\"Build it, and they will come\\". Are there voices in his head, or voices in his corn field?<br /><br />Much like, 'Roy', a family man who 'sees' UFOs in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (which to his relief, turn out to be real UFOs - or are they?) The voices Farmer Ray hears turn out to be real too -er the voices of ghosts. At least other people begin to hear them too.<br /><br />\\"Build it, and they will come\\".<br /><br />\\"Build it\\" apparently being a baseball field on his farm in Iowa. Ray builds a magic ballpark on his farm instead of growing corn. This decision ends up causing him to lose the farm later in the movie (tho the magic ballpark looks only big enough to displace, what? a couple hundred dollars worth of corn?).<br /><br />Ghosts of great baseball players of the past do appear, playing in his magic ballpark before sundown each night.<br /><br />Ray, his family, and the summer-farm look wonderful. Costner looks at ease. There's no violence or sex in the movie (unless you count Ray's marriage to mean Ray has every guy's dream of sex whenever). Come to think of it, his marriage pretty much explains why there's no violence, either. The problem is, what's fun about watching baseball? That's what we are asked to do in 'Field of Dreams'. Watching ghosts play baseball doesn't seem very meaningful, or believable, or fun. Playing baseball is fun. When you're 12 years old and pile into a wagon for a trip to dairy queen after a win, that's fun. It's something, just belonging to a team, and, sheer joy running the bases. I don't remember losing being that bad either. Perhaps it is dangerous. It hurts if the ball hits you, even if the pitcher's 12 years old. And a bit dangerous too, when you put that mitt over your face to make the catch on a long fly ball. And your feelings could get hurt if you don't perform. Actually, would we even play baseball if there were no audience?<br /><br />Ray's told to visit Terry Mann in Philadelphia, an old baseball writer and bring him out to the magic park. Mann (James Earl Jones) turns out to be the noble, infinitely wise black man. Whether Mann is here to assure us, it's OK we're liking this movie, or whether he's here to tell us, this movie is important and, we really should be liking it, I'm not sure. Well, I really wasn't feeling-it up to this point, so I'm guessing the later.<br /><br />Mann travels with Ray back to the farm and is amazed to watch the old players. Is this baseball heaven? The players don't say much and don't seem to know themselves if this is baseball heaven. They do seem content.<br /><br />Ray actually meets his dad, a player who died when Ray was very young. Ray is older than his dad. Ray, has become the dad, in a sense, watching the game.<br /><br />Writer Terry Mann is quite old actually, and the ghosts encourage him to walk across the magic park into the cornfield, to  cross over to the other side. This is the most touching moment in the story. Mann walks happily with the old players into the corn field and his body slowly fades into mist. This is a touching moment, and, I was trying to believe he was going to baseball heaven, but just a tiny part of my mind, just a tiny part, was waiting for aliens to come out, or demons to reach up and grab him or something. It's a cornfield in twilight. And to tell the truth, we don't get to see where they are taking Mann, and the ghosts never really do truly explain what they are.<br /><br />This isn't the climax of the movie, tho. Ray's friend, who's been begging Ray to come to his senses and sell the farm, has a change of heart when he sees the Ghosts too. He says, \\"whatever you do Ray, don't sell this farm\\". Even this isn't the climax of the movie. The climax, is when they see headlights of distant cars driving to the farm. Cars filled with people magically drawn to the magic park, \\"if you build it, they will come\\". Cars filled with people willing apparently to pay money to watch baseball. Money enough to save Ray's family and his farm.<br /><br />We've come to the movies message: It's OK to have Hollywood inspired dreams, but you have to find a way to feed yourself and your family. So get off your rear and get to work. Or get busy with your hustle, whatever it is you do.<br /><br />I don't need Hollywood to tell me to get up and get to work. I've already got a boss who does that.ly to pay money to watch baseball. Money enough to save Ray's family and his farm.<br /><br />We've come to the movies message: It's OK to have Hollywood inspired dreams, but you have to find a way to feed yourself and your family.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I did receive this book for review but that doesn't effect my outlooks on this book:<br />The main charter Sophia is an outcast in her town. She has only two friends and works at the local diner. Whispers of her being a witch float around between all the religious types. Not to mention an annoying old lady who keeps threatening her to move out of her own house. Her friend Ivory is probably more of her best friend than Lauren is. Ivory has many secrets of her own but not willing to share them with anyone just like Sophia. Lauren is more full of life then Sophie and Ivory put together,shes always so bubbly.<br /><br />Sophia finds out that she may just be a descent of a witch. She tries to find tons of information on what she believes to be a curse on her family. The knowledge of the past and Salem witch trials of this book is unbelievable. The Author did do research and not just made it all up. She did make it all very believable and I do believe that all that stuff did happen back then.<br /><br />After she meets the amazing Charles and let me say amazing because he is. Her whole life gets flipped around finding out about elementals who are more then what they seem to be. Can she trust Charles with her own secrets? Charles may just have some of his own.<br /><br />At first they're relationship was kind of awkward such as him telling her he wants to be with her but he doesn't want to get close to her. But as their relationship develops so does Sophia. She becomes more trusting of herself and others. Her and Charles are a great match, they go together really well and their romance just makes you wanna keep reading to find out whats gonna happen next.<br /><br />The action is this book is really good. All the pain that every character went through you can feel. Its all very detailed so that you can understand the pain or frustration going through their minds. I diffidently enjoyed this part of the book, I didn't think it was going to be as detailed as it was.<br /><br />I can easily say that this book is amazing, I couldn't find one downfall. Your in Sophia's head a lot  but her thoughts are not all crazy and jumbled. They make a lot of since and helps you feel how she feels. Anyone can get to know her very easily while reading this book, which makes it an easy read. I did finish this book within four days only because I kept getting interrupted.  I would diffidently recommend this book to anyone who loves stories about paranormal  romance and action./>I can easily say that this book is amazing, I couldn't find one downfall.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app is AMAZING.  Being able to punch in ANY equation (yes, including integrals, differential eqs, etc), and instantly getting the solution, a plot, a series expansion, etc, is incredibly useful for anyone working in math or science.  This app turns my kindle fire into the best calculator money can buy, and the price of the fire &amp; app isn't even all that much higher than a high end graphing calc.<br /><br />I haven't even tried the non-mathematics functions yet, but the integral solver alone makes this app more than worth it.
006117758X|5.0|If Kafka Drank More (and was funnier)<br /><br />A great introduction to Bukowski, a true champion of the underdogs. If you don't get Bukowski from this book you don't get living.<br /><br />I won't go into plot details as others have done so and really, let's be honest, plot is not the reason to read this book (or any of Bukowski). This is not a mystery or thriller. Much of the appeal of Bukowski's writing is one man's insight into human nature, even if viewed from the bottom, as he wanders from bar to bar, job to job, and woman to woman.<br /><br />For fans of 'frat lit' books like \\"I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell\\", Bukowski is light years ahead and you will know who the real master is. Enjoy.

B00028HBKC|1.0|When the film was first released, I heard so many negative opinions about it, that I decided not to bother going to see it. However, I recently watched it online (my only viewing). As it was, I skipped through it, seeing more than enough in about 30 minutes. After my albeit incomplete viewing, I was surprised to see the high percentage of 5 star comments.<br /><br />I'm not into slasher-sadism flicks because there's too much of it in far too many societies today. It's a given that our ancient past was one of extreme violence and life was held as cheap. The film is an incomprehensible and pathetic attempt, but, at what? I saw, nor heard, any message for the masses, unless Gibson meant it as a reminder or portrayal of what Jesus suffered for humanity. For Gibson to make violence and sadism the main theme of the film is useless, not to mention a waste of huge film-making dollars, unless of course he simply wanted to make an ultimate kind of slasher-sadism flick. If that's it, he succeeded. The photography/filming is very good and the actors were fine, but all in all, it is what it is: Your basic slasher-sadism flick, which unfortunately used the popular topic and figure of Jesus as the target, or object, of the violence.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Gibson's earlier films, but since I saw this one? He's now bumped down on my list. Sadly, I don't know if I'll want to watch his early films again, which I have in my DVD collection. If making this film was his \\"passion,\\" or his dream, I am now finding it harder to appreciate what he used to do so well. This film was not \\"entertainment\\" for me, and I wish I hadn't even watched the parts I skimmed.

1583334386|5.0|Speaking of willpower, once I started reading this book, it took every ounce of my willpower to put it down! (And, so yeah, I may have been spotted reading this book in my car while while sitting at red lights. My apologies to the drivers behind me for any [slight] delays my willpower challenges may have caused.)<br /><br />As the above evidence suggests, I can't rave enough about this book. It's a gem, it's a god-send, and it's just that good. You'll have to read for yourself to see what all this gushing is about, but for now, here's a small sampling in the form of the titles' chapters with the author Kelly's big idea summary of each:<br /><br />***Chapter 1: I Will, I Won't, I Want--What Willpower Is, and Why It Matters<br />Willpower is actually three powers--I will, I won't, and I want--that help us to be a better version of ourselves.<br /><br />***Chapter 2: The Willpower Instinct--Your Body Was Born to Resist Cheesecake<br />Willpower is a biological instinct, like stress, that evolved to help protect ourselves from ourselves.<br /><br />***Chapter 3: Too Tired to Resist--Why Self-Control Is Like a Muscle<br />Self-control is like a muscle. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger.<br /><br />***Chapter 4: License to Sin--Why Being Good Gives Us Permission to Be Bad<br />When we turn willpower challenges into measures of moral worth, being good gives us permission to be bad. For better self-control, forget virtue, and focus on goals and values.<br /><br />***Chapter 5:The Brain's Big Lie--Why We Mistake Wanting for Happiness<br />Our brains mistake the promise of reward for a guarantee of happiness, so we chase satisfaction from things that do not deliver.<br /><br />***Chapter 6: What the Hell--How Feeling Bad Leads Us to Giving In<br />Feeling bad leads to giving in, and dropping guilt makes you stronger.<br /><br />***Chapter 7: Putting the Future on Sale--The Economics of Instant Gratification<br />Our inability to see the future clearly leads us into temptation and procrastination.<br /><br />***Chapter 8: Infected!---Why Willpower is Contagious<br />Self-control is influenced by social proof, making both willpower and temptation contagious.<br /><br />***Chapter 9: Don't Read This Chapter--The Limits of \\"I Won't\\" Power<br />Trying to suppress thoughts, emotions, and cravings backfires and makes you feel more likely to think, feel, or do the thing you most want to avoid.<br /><br />***Chapter 10: Final Thoughts<br />If there is a secret for greater self-control, the science points to one thing: the power of paying attention...Self-awareness is the one \\"self\\" you can always count on to help you do what is difficult, and what matters most.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was enthralled and captivated throughout this book. Kelly's down-to-earth delivery of the essential insights of psychology, biology, neuroscience, and economics is beyond out-of-this-world. But, she doesn't just share the findings; she provides ways for you to see and do for yourself. Sprinkled throughout her discussions are \\"Under the Microscope\\" and \\"Willpower Experiment\\" features of this book which provide many personalized opportunities for gaining self-awareness and experimenting with new strategies to help you address your own willpower challenges--be it over-eating, over-drinking, over-spending, over-thinking, over-indulging, over-Facebooking, under-doing, or perhaps even over-reading at red lights.<br /><br />In the introduction, Kelly shares her hopes that: \\"If this book did nothing else but help you see that common humanity of your willpower struggles, I would be happy. But I hope that it will do far more, and that the strategies in this book will empower you to make real and lasting changes in your life....By the time you finish this book, you'll have greater insight into your challenges and a new set of self-control strategies to support you.\\"<br /><br />And, indeed she delivers on that hope. Reading this book providesthe insight you need to understand--and more importantly, have compassion for--your personal challenges, along with the techniques, tools, and perspective makeovers you need to gain more of that seemingly elusive self-control. Now, how can you resist that?<br /><br />(Just look out for green lights while reading.)the insight you need to understand--and more importantly, have compassion for--your personal challenges, along with the techniques, tools, and perspective makeovers you need to gain more of that seemingly elusive self-control.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|They were on a hiatus after '95, than in '02 Layne Stanley died but AIC didn't. He was a very important part of the band and they won't be the same but they can continue without him and still be good. William DuVall is the new vocalist for AIC, along with Jerry Cantrell. Black Gives Way to Blue is their first studio album in 15 years and I was very impressed by it. It was worth the wait also, it's not Dirt or Facelift but it's an improvement over their final self-titled album from '95. I prefer it over that album, which was good but it had some filler. They were also changing direction, they didn't go back to grunge and their early '90s roots but it has a hint of their early sounds which wasn't present on their self-titled as much. If you enjoyed Jerry Cantrell's solo work than you'll probably like Black Gives Way to Blue. It sounds a lot like Jerry Cantrell's sophomore solo album Degradation Trip. I really liked his solo albums but this is even better. Includes their hits Check My Brain, Your Decision, Lesson Learned and 8 other great songs. Black Gives Way to Blue is a great album for the end of the decade and one of the best albums of the '00s.
0374275637|5.0|What a treasure this book is! It's not only a masterfully written, highly accessible, and fascinating summary of Daniel Kahneman's life-time (and Nobel-prize-receiving) contributions to behavioral economics, it's also a humbling tour of both the capability--and the culpability--of our thinking.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, Kahneman highlights the dilemma of our thinking:<br />\\"As we navigate our lives, we normally allow ourselves to be guided by impressions and feelings, and the confidence we have in our intuitive beliefs and preferences is usually justified. But not always. We are often confident even when we are wrong.\\" (p. 4)<br /><br />His aim of the book is to help us navigate this dilemma and to<br />\\"improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgement and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to describe them. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest an intervention to limit the damage that bad judgments and choices often cause.\\" (p. 4)<br /><br />This richer and more precise language begins with giving names to the two systems that drive our (fast and slow) thinking: System 1 and System 2. While System 1 operates automatically and quickly and often outside of our conscious awareness, System 2 slows the thinking process down and allows us to perform mental activities that require effort, such as complex computation and decision making. In essence, System 1 accounts for our intuitive and emotion-based thinking, and System 2 is behind our attentional, deliberate, and logical thinking. The dance between the two systems is rather remarkable, and allows us to manage the endless choices and decisions we make in our day-to-day lives. But, this dance also has quite a few missteps that result in cognitive errors and intuition biases. By giving language to label the sources of these missteps--such as anchoring effects, narrow framing, intensity matching, non-regressive predicting, and excessive coherence--we can \\"bring together in memory everything we know about a bias, its causes, its effects, and what can be done about it.\\" (p. 418)<br /><br />And, that's exactly what this book provides: A language for understanding and navigating the way we think....and the way we think about our thinking. Guiding us through prospect theory--the behavioral economics adaptation to the utility theory that is assumed in standard economics--Kahneman gives us the words to identify, describe, and manage the natural human tendency to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses, and not on actual statistics and facts. His terms of \\"remembering self\\" and \\"experiencing self\\" provide a framework for thinking about how we can maximize our well-being by avoiding the common traps which he labels as the peak-end rule, duration neglect, the focusing illusion, and miswanting. Throughout the book, Kahneman's mastery of human thinking is put into words that are beyond words. And, by the end of the book, this language comes together to beautifully tell the story of the human mind.<br /><br />My recommendation: Think fast and get your hands on a copy of this book. Then, read it slowly and take in every word of the language that will forever change the way you think about thinking.predicting, and excessive coherence--we can \\"bring together in memory everything we know about a bias, its causes, its effects, and what can be done about it.\\" (p. 418)<br /><br />And, that's exactly what this book provides: A language for understanding and navigating the way we think....and the way we think about our thinking.

And, by the end of the book, this language comes together to beautifully tell the story of the human mind.<br /><br />My recommendation: Think fast and get your hands on a copy of this book. Then, read it slowly and take in every word of the language that will forever change the way you think about thinking.

1594203334|4.0|After reading some of the negative reviews, I must conclude that those who gave this book 1 - 2 stars didn't actually READ the book.  This is NOT a book where the author tells you how to parent your child because she is an excellent parent herself.  Rather, it gives some insight into some positive elements of the French parenting philosophy.  It's well worth a read for Americans who are looking to raise polite, patient and (less)selfish children.

030788743X|3.0|I had heard great things about \\"Ready Player One\\", and I needed some escapism, so I read the whole thing today, cover to cover, to get the full experience in one sitting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite the rave reviews I had read elsewhere, I found \\"Ready Player One\\" to be a definite disappointment. It was, for the most part, rather shallow. The plot kept me going, but just barely -- and I repeatedly got the feeling I've read all this before, but it was done better the first time.<br /><br />Players speak with a stilted artificiality, and I feel like I'm reading a comic book or a young-adult novel most of the time through it. Every so often the main character goes off into a monologue about something, like how he believes Jesus is no more real than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, and he thinks adults who are religious are gullible fools -- but that's not depth of character, that's cramming the author's own views down our throats.<br /><br />Other aspects of the author's views and how he forces them on us are just as annoying, like how he makes sure we positively know the main character isn't offended when he encounters a token lesbian (don't worry, it's not important to the plot in any way), but the author also casually in a throw-off way makes sure we know the main character doesn't consider transgender women to be \\"real\\" women, as opposed to women who were born that way.<br /><br />The plot moves from point A to point B to point C, with occasional deus ex machina to get the characters out of tough spots -- much like the plot in a typical video-game adventure, and I'm sorry, but I don't consider video games to generally be great fiction. Maybe making the novel itself emulate the dull, lifeless plot of a typical video game was the author's intention, but I doubt it.<br /><br />People told me that I would love the book because I grew up as a geeky, video-gaming, roleplayer in the 80s, and I would catch all the references. And I did catch pretty much every singlereference, having spent far too many hours playing almost every game mentioned, and knowing everything from the Monty Python quotes to the Dungeon and Dragons modules to the strategies for playing the different Atari 2600 games so revered by the novel's author.<br /><br />But I didn't love \\"Ready Player One\\". Catching the references was, indeed, one of the minor \\"thrills\\" of the book, but that quickly got dull, like I was reading a trivia book about the 80s.<br /><br />FYI, in \\"Ready Player One,\\" there's a big, multi-player virtual game world called OASIS. And in case you haven't heard of it, there's already an actual virtual-reality program out there called \\"SecondLife,\\" which is a heck of a lot like OASIS in almost every important way, in that it's a huge, multi-world, multi-themed online simulation that's free to play -- and it exists for real, today. I should know, because I used to be a serious SecondLife addict, spending untold hours and days immersed in it, losing myself from the drudgery of the real world. So that idea in the book was remarkably familiar to me, and I think it's worth checking out on Google if you plan to read this book.<br /><br />Most of us probably know the story of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", about a reclusive genius who decides to retire but he doesn't have an heir, so he devises a series of tests, with the winner getting it all, instantly becoming the company's super-rich CEO. And a bunch of kids from different backgrounds try, but the true hero of the story is a young, innocent, incredibly poor boy with a wonderful heart.<br /><br />All that sound familiar yet? Try taking \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" but instead make it where the winner becomes the CEO of \\"SecondLife\\", and you get \\"Ready Player One.\\"<br /><br />Maybe I wanted more from the book showing how truly dystopian the world has become. What are things like outside of the cities, for example? Or outside of the United States? Or, most importantly, outside of thevirtual world of OASIS? Have wolves gone extinct? Do some people still live as farmers in rural Kansas? Does the Amazon rain forest still exist? How bad truly are things for the world -- and how truly important is the fate of OASIS in grand the scheme of things?<br /><br />By the end, \\"Ready Player One\\" came off to me as pointless an expenditure of time as if you just decided to play video games all day. It was fun for a while -- but now I wish I has spent the day in the sunshine enjoying the real world.<br /><br />And actually, one of the most important secondary characters in the novel would agree with me, I think. It's weird in that the entire novel seems to praise OASIS and talk about how wonderful it is, and how it must be defended by the evil people who want to take it over and turn it into a commercial nightmare. Everybody in the novel worships it practically, and couldn't imagine life without it because it's so great.<br /><br />That is, except the original partner of the man who created OASIS. The partner condemns OASIS as nightmarish in and of itself. He attacks it because of the fact it's so addictive, it has led almost everybody in the world to stop trying to fix all the problems around them, and instead gotten them to just chuck it all and escape into a false virtual reality whenever they get a chance. He blames OASIS for being one of the main reasons humanity has allowed the world to fall into a dystopia instead of actually doing something to save it all.<br /><br />You'd think that would cause a conflict in the mind of the protagonist, right? How maybe the thing he's trying to save (OASIS) isn't worth saving? Maybe it should be destroyed after all? Maybe it wouldn't be that bad if the evil people really did take it over, because then people would start logging out and looking around themselves instead of living in a perfect virtual world all the time? Maybe if OASIS wasn't free and flawless, people would rise up and protest, instead of not caring thatmajor corporations can enslave somebody for life just for falling three months behind in credit-card payments (which actually happens in the book).<br /><br />But there was no conflict about it for the main character. We're supposed to think he's awesome because he spent thousands of hours watching Silver Spoons marathons and playing Intellivision games and memorizing the lines to Wargames and Ferris Beuller's Day Off -- but we're supposed to not notice that he doesn't really care about the real world around him. And, to be honest, being a walking-talking 80s encyclopedia doesn't make for a great person, and because that's what all the main characters are in this book, I really didn't like any of them that much.<br /><br />You might get a kick out of reading \\"Ready Player One\\" if you want a light diversion for an afternoon, or if you pine for old episodes of Family Ties and Square Pegs, or if you think Duran Duran was the greatest band that ever existed. Just don't expect great literature -- or deep insights into the universe the author has created, and how it got to be the way it is.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|I am a calligrapher so I was interested in the Verso Case, which is embossed with the cities of the world on it. Someone wrote a review and said they used gold paint to fill in the embossing,  I did it and it looks great!<br /><br /> I used a different kind of paint. I used LUMIERE by Jacquard, color # 553, Brass. It was $5.29 at the local Ben Franklin in Grass Valley,Ca. I painted it on, 2 lines at a time, got old t-shirt material with a little bit of water on it to rub off the excess. Then when it was all done, I heat set it with a heat setting tool. If you don't have one, just use a hair dryer. I just did it for a few minutes, ( 2-3) and it looks great!

B004T4LUPW|5.0|Very nice app! Using on my sony xperia mini pro, android 2.3.4.<br /><br />I almost didn't buy it due to the lack of a trial version.  Finally decided to give it a try anyway, and I'm REALLY glad that I did.<br /><br />First of all, it is the ONLY app I could find that syncs directly with google and does not rely on android sync data.  Android wouldn't sync events farther back than the previous month or so.  I know there is a workaround for this (actually, I learned that on the calengoo website!), but I didn't feel like removing and re-adding every event in my calendar.  Even if I can do it as a batch export/delete/import, I have so many different calendars that I would have to do this on..  I don't want to put in that much effort.  Plus, what if something goes wrong?  I'm too nervous about losing events.  6 dollars and I don't have to do anything at all, it's all just done for me.  It syncs everything!  There is a choice of one year or all data.. I think there was a third choice which was less than 1 year, but I don't remember as I wanted all of the data.  It keeps whatever calendar colors I assign in google calendar -- no more trying to match up colors for different calendars!  Plus, I can keep the event database on the sd card, while leaving the app in the internal memory.  This way, widgets still work, but I don't have to put any more data in the internal memory.. the app takes 4-5mbs according to the developer (4.57mbs on my phone, don't know if it's the same for everyone though).<br /><br />Second, there are a ton of options to customize the look of this app.  It was a bit overwhelming at first, but the defaults are all pretty much ok.  The only thing I changed as far as the look goes is I made the grid-lines darker in the month view.  This change was reflected in my month-view widget as well.<br /><br />I emailed the developer one night with some questions, and got a very thorough reply by the next morning.  So, there's definitely good support with this app,too.<br /><br />Overall, very happy!
B0034G4P4O|4.0|I'm coming at this movie not having read or seen anything else from the Tintin franchise. I admit I really only checked it out because of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg's involvement. I liked the film overall, but had mixed feelings.<br /><br />First, the animation is incredible. The movie really blurs the line between live-action and animation. The characters all look realistic, except for their big noses. You can see the characters' pores and individual strands of hair. Moreover, the characters really look like they're acting. Every once in a while you'd see Tintin give a subtle glance full of emotion. I absolutely love the look of the film and hope more animation is done in this style.<br /><br />However, I'm not sure the ultra-realistic animation style fit the style of Tintin. This particularly came out during the movie's attempts at humor and the more \\"cartoonish\\" moments. The animation style takes this movie outside the realm of \\"cartoon\\", so it just seemed odd when the movie took a cartoonish approach to humor. For example, the Captain Haddock character burping alcohol just seemed disgusting, not funny. Also, when the characters are thrown around without any regard for the laws of physics, it removes suspension of disbelief. Ultimately, I think parts of the movie were victims of the success of the animation. In retrospect, I can understand why other animated movies intentionally take an exaggerated approach.<br /><br />Another problem with the movie is the plot. It's just sterile and boring. It's a routine treasure hunt, but there's nothing particularly exciting about the treasure or the villains or the plot twists. It's pretty straightforward with few genuine surprises. The characters take a long journey just to find a small pot of gold and jewels in a house. It seems like Tintin has an exciting life, but he comes off as vanilla. This movie was for Americans an introduction to Tintin and I could tell this just wasn't one of his more exciting adventures.Maybe something more along the lines of a murder investigation would have been more gripping.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - overall, I enjoyed Tintin. I think because so much of the movie is done so well, those little problems become that much more glaring. I'd definitely encourage Spielberg and Jackson to make another Tintin movie, this time with a bit more emphasis on plot.

B00005ATQ9|5.0|I remember reading an article in Time magazine on this movie when it first came out in 1975.  Among the interesting technical aspects of Barry Lyndon was the large aperture lenses that allowed the filming of indoor scenes using only candlelight.  This technique imparted to these scenes an amber ambiance that evokes the Britain of the mid to late 1700's.  Also adding to the unique atmosphere of this film is the music of the traditional Irish instrumental ensemble \\"The Chieftans.\\"  I especially love their piece \\"Woman of Ireland.\\"<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick tells a story that seems more deeply personal than those usually chosen by this director.  As the young Irishman makes his way in the world, he finds his way into the heart of a young and wealthy widow.  As the veteran of many love affairs, Lyndon does not find himself swayed by the affection of the widow.  Instead, he recognizes a financial and business opportunity and embarks on what might be called a marriage of convenience.  Accordingly, while enjoying the status conferred on him by this advantageous marriage, he does not properly return the genuine affection of his lovely wife, choosing instead to consort with women of low repute.  This treatment of his wife does not go unnoticed by the son of her first marriage, which sets the stage for tragedy.<br /><br />In time, Lyndon's feelings for his wife change for the better, especially after she bears his child--a boy to whom Lyndon becomes completely devoted.  But the son from the first marriage will not forget Lyndon's early treatment of his mother, leading to a confrontation that provides the climax of this story.<br /><br />I saw this movie as a graduate student with my best friend.  We often discussed this movie together.  My friend maintained that Lyndon was a \\"rotter\\" and would always remain such.  I believed that Lyndon had become a better person who developed a genuine love for his wife and child, and that he regretted his earlier misdeeds.  I invite you to see this movie and make your own determination!see this movie and make your own determination!

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I picked up a copy of season one of this show after seeing just one commercial for it.  It looked interesting enough and the fact that Sean Bean was in it made this a must buy for me.  So I purchased the first season and popped dvd one into my blu-ray player.  I was totally unprepared for and blown away by what this show had to offer.  This show is definitely not like most of the traditional medieval style fantasy movies/television shows out there.  This show bravely takes a convincing and unflinching look at the characters and their interactions together.  This means that most issues/elements that get dumbed down/sanitized in a lot of fantasy movies/television program is left intact in the this show from the fascinating characters both good and bad, their realistic motivations for doing the things that they are doing even if you don't agree with their methods, clever villains rather than the usual dimwitted ones, and good guys who don't always win regardless of how perilous the situation they find themselves in which to me is a welcome change.  This show also has lots of twists, plenty of political intrigue, superb action, and features some of the best production values I've ever see on a television program.  Season 1 is estimated to have cost 60 million dollars to make and it shows in the various locations featured in the story, the costumes, and overall quality.  All I can say is wow!  I highly recommend giving this show a try you will not be disappointed.
B000001EGA|5.0|Classic Elton John album.  Every song is good, and I never tire of listening to it.  This is from the days before he changed his sound and went more mainstream, and I don't think his music was ever better than it was in the 70's.

B004XQO90E|5.0|BEYOND pleasantly surprised though being a die-hard quantum leap (ecstatic btw that they started playing re-runs of this show again) & groundhog day fan, it's no wonder I was absolutely mesmerized & didn't blink nor speak the entire 93 minutes. The plot, the cast (though in 8 minute chunks was STILL adequate time to emotionally bond or despise the characters), the twists, the turns THE TWIST, did I mention the twist? Lordy... I'll refrain from being a KJ & releasing any spoilers though I will tell you this... It's 1:38 AM PDT, I picked this movie up from Blockbuster Express & immediately bought the Blu-ray version off of Amazon... It was THAT gosh-darn good... This movie was a mind 'you know what', but in a good way. Not that you need to have general knowledge of quantum physics though the emotional roller coaster this flick puts you on at times is exhausting... Great flick & praise the lord for Amazon Prime that I'll get this in (2) days to watch over & over again... (Just like Groundhog Day)

1439192812|5.0|This is a phenomenal book about science, and the magic behind it. I consider myself a rational man who is in tune with reality, however reading this book has refined my reality even more. This book has rejuvenated my love for science and how we are able to know what really is true, and what is not. I have been guilty of falling for some of the myths laid out in the book at some point in my life, if only I had read a book like this when I was growing up. I am already introducing my little siblings to the book so that they don't end falling for myths and pseudo-science like most of the world has. This book should be required reading for anyone that whats to know how science works, and wants it told to him in a simple manner.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I don't typically read this type of book, but, after hearing about it every time I turned around (and seeing the video of Katniss spearing the apple), I decided to buy the first book and give it a try. Other than a slew of excessive, unnecessary dialogue tags slowing the pace, the prose was smooth, and the story held my interest. I'd love to tell you more, but this is one book for which you don't want any spoilers.<br /><br />If you decide to try The Hunger Games, be ready for a bittersweet ending. And be ready to buy books 2 and 3. When book 1 ends, you'll want to keep reading.

0439023483|4.0|this whole series has changed me. it was a wonderful read, and could not put it down. as wonderful and imaginative as it was there are so many twists and turns, especially the heart wrentching kind. when certain cjaracters in the story took the turn for the worst i couldn't help but cry in real life. those where the only times i could put it down.<br /><br />but as great as this book was i must warn that this is NOT a book for an easily disturbed young adult. honestly i wouldn't let my kids read it unless they were in high school to understand the full implications of what this story tells because there is so much more. as the trilogy unfolds you will began to question which one is the lesser of 2 evils? as much as i love this trilogy i will not be watching the movie(s) because of the horror i experienced.<br /><br />the reason i gave this 4 stars is for one easy and specific reason. its for the whole series. and i honestly believe it shouldn't have been set for ages as low as 7 grade.

1416972242|4.0|Much better than the first book in the series! However, it was by no means perfect.<br /><br />The pro is that Clare is a fantastic storyteller. The story is complex, exciting and you are dying to find out what happens next. The con is that is can be predictable at times. Also, there are a few things in the book that aren't really all that creative, however Clare mixes them into her fabulous world and makes them her own.<br /><br />One big issue I had with the first book was the characters, Clare was TERRIBLE with the characters. They were unlikable and unbelievable. Luckily, she greatly improved with this book. The characters were more likable, more real and there was some actual character development this time. I still think Clary is annoying though, I don't think I have ever disliked the main character in a book so much. She is getting better though... slowly.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next one. Here's hoping the author continues to improve.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Hago este review no de la pelicula, sino de la frustración por la copia digital que viene en la misma. Sucede que la copia se obtiene a través de Flixster, y resulta que está disponible solo para Estados Unidos. Qué pasa con todas las personas del resto del mundo? Simplemente perdemos nuestra copia? Considero que si nosotros tomamos la molestia de comprar una película original, esperando tener la copia digital, deberían de tomarnos en cuenta para la promoción. Esto realmente decepciona.
0439023521|5.0|I'm not even going to attempt to do a long drawn out review. I'll keep it simple.<br />This book is absolutely brilliant. It is hands down one of the most impressive books I have read. It's dark, powerful, touching and totally innovative. It's one of those books that I can see becoming a classic, a book that will still be relevant in many years to come.
0439023491|2.0|I enjoyed the first book quite a bit. I tolerated the Deus ex machina of how all the other competitors were conveniently killed so Katniss didn't have to deal with it, because overall the book started fast and interesting and was engaging the whole way through. Such is not the case here. The book starts with the epilogue that was missing from the end of the first book. You get answers to what happened to Katniss and Peeta and Gale after the games, but it takes a really long time for anything to happen.  I read it on my Kindle so I know how far into the book I am with a glance. At 41% nothing had happened and I wasn't sure what was going to happen. And imagine my dissapointment when the thing that happens is just a rehash of the first book? Katniss back in the Hunger Games? Are you kidding? I already read that book! This bout in the games doesn't have nearly the sense of awe or intrigue to them, because I know that at least Katniss and Peeta will live, which I didn't know when I read the first book. This round of the games is a pale imitation.<br /><br />I gave the review 2 stars instead of 1 because it was still compelling to see what would happen to the characters, and I was trying to figure out where the author was going. I really thought the return trip to the Games was a smokescreen and something else would happen. I equate it to watching the last season or two of your favorite shows. On their own, they don't hold up as great episodes the way the early season did, but you watch them because you are invested in the characters and interested in how everything ends up.<br /><br />And I also feel upset that the second book isn't out in paperback yet. It's a seperate issue, and has nothing to do with the stars I gave it, but with the third book having been out for a year or so, the fact that the only physical copy of the book is still the $19.99 hardback edition just smacks of greed.<br /><br />My honest recomendation would be to read the first book only, see the movie even, because that does look pretty good, then read wiki summaries of the other two and call it a day.ie even, because that does look pretty good, then read wiki summaries of the other two and call it a day.
1416955070|3.0|Goodness was this a difficult book to rate! City of Bones was truly fantastic in some ways, but really horrible in others, and unfortunately, the good didn't make up for the bad - hence the 3 stars.<br /><br />So here's the thing, City of Bones has an amazing story and the author created an incredible universe for her readers. The story was complex and fascinating, the world was familiar, yet still innovative, and it all was a pleasure to read. I loved learning about the demons and Downworlders, the Shadowhunters and their history. It was a joy. Good so far, right? Yeah, well while I adored the magical world in this book, I had serious issues with the actual characters. The characters were awful.<br /><br />The author was great at crafting a story, but terrible at creating characters. The main character, Clary, was incredibly dry and blah. She had very little personality at all, and the few personality traits she did have were not at all likeable. She's a rude brat a good chunk of the time and a meek and pathetic the rest of the time. Sure, there were a few scenes where she is fiery and ballsy, but for the most part she was a bratty and dull. I do wonder if the author did this on purpose so that we can see Clary grow in future books, like \\"hey she's a weak and pathetic child now, but later she's going to grow into a strong woman that doesn't let cute boys treat her like crap!\\" I sure hope that's what she was going for, because if Clary continues to act like she does in this first book I won't read the entire series.<br /><br />As for the cute boy that treats Clary like crap, that's Jace, one of the other main characters. He handsome, he's tough and... he is a total jerk that degrades and insults everyone, especially Clary (and she lets him 90% of the time). I get that he's hurting inside and he covers it up by being cocky, but the author took it to a ridiculous level. That boy gave me constant whiplash.<br /><br />I could go on listing every character and all of their issues, but instead I'll go jump to character relationships. For example, Clary and Simon are supposedly best friends, they have been for ten years, but not once did I feel like they were close at all. The first chapter starts off with Clary being bitchy to Simon, rolling her eyes at him and ignoring him, and yet, we are somehow supposed to believe that they are the best of friends and that she loves him. Ooook. Yeah, not buying it. Almost every relationship in the book wasn't believable, not just Simon and Clary, and it's something that the author improves on. You need more than a good story, you need good characters to make it all work.<br /><br />Ok, enough ranting about the characters. Overall, the story itself was wonderful (mostly), and because of that, I will read the next book in the series. City of Bones was imaginative, fast-paced, action-packed and all of those other good cliché words. I loved the world, just not the characters in it. Some authors improve throughout a series, and here's hoping Cassandra Clare does.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is awesome. It pulls you in so you can't put it down!!! I spent almost the whole night finishing it and was sad when I realized that the series is over.
1416972250|5.0|City of Glass is the best in the series so far, Clare is most definitely improving with each book. The story was complex, fast-paced and full of exciting twists and turns. Some parts of the story though were totally predictable, however there were many unexpected bits as well. Certain aspects of the story and the world Clare created are incredibly innovative and unique, while other things are painfully cliche and blah. So I have mixed feelings.<br /><br />Overall, it was an enjoyable read, it was fulfilling. I am curious to see what she does in the next book, what the big bad drama will be then. Here's hoping the author continues to improve (particularly when it comes to characters and character development).
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|this app was another great cut the rope game. it had all new levels that i was looking for! not much fifteenth from the origanal though.... i still love it and was the first app i ever downloaded! :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app. I can work in all of my programs from my atrix, including AutoCAD! It beats having a VPN. It would be nice if it could be encrypted.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is such a fun fun game I just wish that they could make it a little better I know that it is awesome now but if they upgrade it it might be a really better.and better fun than it is now most people don't even love the game but when they upgrade it maybe they might like it and they might get more and more people playing fruit ninga.

B0052GACNM|2.0|I have enjoyed Tony Bennett's style and interpretations of songs from the Great American Songbook for years.  His Duets I CD was somewhat of a disappointment for a couple of reasons:<br />  1.  Trying to mix Tony's style with that of another genre (ie. country, rock and roll, or whatever) does not always make for a good listening experience.<br />  2.  Some of the songs ware never meant to be done as duets.  It would take a fantastic arranger to make some of the songs work.<br />  All that being said, I decided to give Duets II a try thinking some of the above issues may have been resolved after learning from the mistakes on Duets I, but I was  wrong.  I enjoy an occasional duet on a solo artist's CD....it's a wonderful thing and can add variety and a new twist to the artist's repertoire.  However, this was way too much variety for me!  I still love Tony Bennett, and love most of the other artists on both CD's, but hopefully they will NOT attempt a Duets III CD.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Mr. Larson did a wonderful job bringing every details full circle.  The characters were not boring and I enjoyed all the different personalities of each character. This book was a GREAT read and I was entertained to the very end.<br /><br />This is the 2nd book in the trilogy. I put this book on hold at the library along with the 3rd book, 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest', the 3rd book was made available before this one and having read the 3rd book I was more able to grasp what was happening.<br /><br />Very good book!
1904633439|5.0|Atty. Mr. Utterson is worried, as the keeper of Dr Henry Jekyll's will. The will gives everything to Edward Hyde incase of Henry's death or disappearance.  Mr. Utterson met the hideous Hyde once and does not trust him. Well it looks like Henry's will will have to be executed as the housekeeper; Mr. Pool thinks Hyde hid Henry's body.<br /><br />Once again, I saw Spencer Tracy before I read the book, so I was anticipating a different type of story. I read \\"Treasure Island\\" so I am familiar with Stevenson's writing style but I did not realize that this story was more of a mystery that draws the conclusion and revelation in the end. The explanation of man and his duel personality is excellent and I suspect he draws on personal experience.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000EYUD4 Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde Double Feature (1932/1941)]]
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Imagine what it is like to drive a racing car down public streets at incredible speed. Grand Prix puts you right in the picture. The rain sequence is amazing. Recommended for all car buffs.
B000AP04NI|4.0|A curiosity in Fred Zinnemann's filmography. What could drive you to take a look at this improbable story that seems, at times, shot by a soviet director for the glory of the Little Father of the Peoples ? In Todd-AO and in color. Firstly there is in Oklahoma! a dream scene which literally scotch taped me in my seat then there is Gloria Grahame, yes, Gloria Grahame as a naive nymphomaniac. You can't say no to Gloria Grahame. Highly recommended.
B0055DNH0C|5.0|I am in love with and fascinated by Pitbull, every song is a winner a mover and a shaker. I keep this cd in constant rotation on my ipod. I wish there were more stars I would give this cd a ten plus plus.
B00005JL0I|3.0|**1/2. I certainly missed a lot of references to the James Bond films shot before Casino Royale but I liked the homage to [[ASIN:B00388PK1U The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition)]] and to the German expressionist films of the 20's in the Berlin scene. Good entertaining value for a film that hopefully allowed John Huston to pay his taxes. Deborah Kerr is also great as the nymphomaniac Lady Fiona McTarry. Recommended.
1451627289|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in years...early on, I probably read every one he wrote and along the way just got interested in other authors...well, I needed something to read and I thought, why not?  I downloaded it into my Kindle, read about 20% and headed to Paris for 10 days...I love reading and generally do a lot while I travel...you probably think I'm nuts to read instead of sightsee, but I've been to Paris dozens of times and I rarely get to sit and read at home....while I was on the airplane I picked it up and once again he got me....I couldn't wait to get into my apartment and start reading...well, in 6 days, taking SOME time out to actually enjoy Paris, I completed it....this book was entertaining from start to finish...I enjoyed every page and when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about getting back to it...I'm sad it's over....I don't want to go into any storyline details, because you just have to read it yourself...I'm once again a Stephen King fan...just loved it...
B005FISBTO|5.0|Its around mostly the 5th season that most really successful cable series kinda dip and fall. As for Dexter season 6 which I just finished; I say its really only just began. Not only does this season continue to have excellent performances(Mos Def, Colin Hanks), but continues to blow your mind and having yourself wonder; Who? What? Where?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the 'Fight Club'esque episode where Dex hangs out with his brother Brian in a trip of crazy antics.<br />Best Quote Ever, from Brian - \\"Ahhh, Deb, the one that got away\\".<br /><br />I'm not going to give anything away of course, but just so you know; this season is very Religious in a lot of aspects, and it makes Dexter think about his own faith and beliefs. This time around its the Dooms Day Killers and of course its up to Dex and the cast of Miami Metro to solve it. Big changes for a lot of characters are happening, Batista, Quinn and especially Deb are going through hard times as well in their personal lives.<br /><br />Always a show that makes you want the next episode right away, and the ending? Oh my God! Dexter as a series continues to keep you coming back for more.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is such a great book. It was made for young adults but I'm in my 40's and love it. Buying all three books saved a lot of money. I've been telling all my freinds to purchase this.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|This movie is just that good, old-fashioned storytelling that Spielberg does so well. It is a good, rainy day movie that you can enjoy with your children. It would be mildly scary for younger children, but for older children, mostly suspenseful rather than actually scary.  Dreamworks should have put more money into promoting this movie.  It's not strong on special effects, but it is a story about a teenage adventure rather than a sci-fi spectacle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am addicted to the games........I love, love, love the games. My son and I spend hours playing sky hunters and pidgeon bombers.
B006ZEDZNY|1.0|Bought this using Instant Video to watch during my travel - the order said that it was queued to be downloaded but the video didn't download to my pc - even after 3 days. And there's no way to re-download. Hit or miss! Amazon needs to fix - it's easy for them to check if the download actually happened.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING<br />Poorly written, constantly repetitious, since I won't read the other two I will bet all three books would not make one disguting book.
1856697525|5.0|UPDATE<br /><br />Amazon thankfully is shipping the book. I've accordingly changed my rating from one to five stars<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />think this book deserves a four out of five but I'm giving one star for its availability which has been like this for months. My order has been on hold for months. I think I've been waiting since November. If the book has sold out of its print run, I hope a second run is forthcoming soon. Right now, I'm extremely disappointed.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is the most important book I ever read about alimentation.All is said with the utmost sane sense and realistic awareness.<br />Author's guts in breaking up old myths concerning human nourishment is outstanding.<br />Obligatory reading.
B004LWZW7E|1.0|My all time worst movie. I should have been apid to watch this garbage.  I've been better entertained at the dentists office having my teeth drilled. Did they actually pay the actors for this work? Justin timberlake is such a lightweight, he needs to find another boy band. This trash must have been written by a six year old.
B00064VR0W|5.0|if you are a rod stewart fan,get this while you can.you will be glued to your TV.If you have surround sound this will blow your mind.I'm glad I got mine and wouldn't trade it for anything
B0061S073A|5.0|great for sharing your kindle with kids.  it keeps them out of the stuff you don't want them to mess with while having fun with the books and apps that are ok for them.
B00701897I|5.0|I really did not know what to expect. I am American, so I had never heard of TinTin until the release of this film.<br />It absolutely took my breath away.  I didn't even know what hit me until after watching it.  It is even hard for me to write about TinTin.<br />To be fair, I was lucky enough to watch it in the original 3D version on BluRay.  3D enhanced this movie into the stratospheres. I cannot say enough for how powerful the use of 3D is in this movie.  It makes a huge difference and I am sure increased my love for TinTin by leaps and bounds.  The 3D TinTin something to behold!!!<br />This is one movie I am so glad I purchased on Blu Ray. I really want to watch it again and again.  I feel I only skimmed the surface the first time through.<br />The plot is somewhat complex.  The characters are remarkable.  TinTin and Snowy captured from what I can see, the comic characters to a T.<br />It is a very fast paced action film that never ever stops for a second.  But that is how the comic book is. One thing after another.<br />That being said, it got under my skin.  The motion capture photography is like nothing I have ever seen before.  It is spectacular. The colors are cinematic wonders.  Spielberg outdid himself. I feel this is the Indiana Jones I had been told was so great. I loved this movie a thousand times more than every Indian Jones put together. But I am sure that is just me.<br />The animation is in a class by itself. And the movie has stuck with me in a way no movie does. I can't get it out of my mind.<br />I am surprised by the tepid amount of reviews for TinTin.  Maybe it is an American thing. I think in Europe where TinTin is well known it was a smash hit.<br />I loved it so much.  What a wonderful film!!!  I had no idea I would even like it.  I did not even have any big expectations for it once it was released here in the US.  I do not want to give anything away so I won't talk plot here.  Just that TinTin buys a ship that holds many secrets untold. That is all I want to say.<br />I hear Peter Jackson is going to direct the next TinTin.  Wow. I cannot wait.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|i think apple app. store should work together there games they have are really nice so that's what ive got to say

B007IQX1G4|1.0|Wow, this really never takes off at all. Depressing and half acted melancholy boredom. Patton Oswald is wasted in his role, but he is the best part of this film. Unlikable people and a very unlikable script.<br /><br />Disappointed.
1444737090|5.0|Such a good book..a rag to riches type of story...a cat..or should I say an angel sent to help James discover a new life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game keeps me occupied for awhile. lots of choices to choose from.  just a fun bordum buster, really! a great app
B005XQLBU4|2.0|This game is interesting and definitely a step up from the original Missile Command. What you'll notice, right away, is that when you survive a round, you'll receive the chance to upgrade your missile's features, however, it's not really enough to satisfy. After several rounds of repairing damaged buildings and upgrading your missile's features, you'll reach the limit and from there on, it's nothing more than round after round of repitition. I do regret buying the game ( not that it hurt my wallet too much ) because it's rather shallow. I recommend some kind of story, several different levels with a variety of tasks and several more upgrades.

B005K17RU0|3.0|this is a very nice and thorough app that displays weather information beautifully. HOWEVER, it appears to have some major bugs on the Kindle Fire. After I start the app and try to navigate around its screens, probably 50% of the time it freezes or crashes. that factor makes it hard to give this the rating it may deserves.  I have looked for other weather apps but there are very few.
0525423281|5.0|I got this book last week and I fell in love with it. It has everything, family drama, boyfriend issues,crushes,and coming of age. Perkins is one of my favorite authors she has the same writing style as Sarah Dessen another one of my favorite authors. I give this book 5/5 stars because I really enjoyed this book, it wasn't boring and its a quick read. A perfect summer read. :)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm an avid fiction reader and probably read 5-6 books a month, but it's so rare to encounter a book like this where it pull you in and doesn't let go.  Yeh, the general concept of this book is something that has been explored quite thoroughly, but the smooth plot and strong characters make it stand out.  I just basically spent 15 hours straight reading it and that's extremely rare for me nowadays.  Just read it, you won't regret it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like having the Kindle app on my Android phone.  I can read on the go whenever I have a moment and I don't have to carry something larger than my phone with me.  Would love to get a real Kindle reader one of these days though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I reacted the same way every old school Battle Royale fan probably did when they saw the commercials for the upcoming movie - \\"Oh great, another hack author ripping off someone else's idea, exactly what we need.\\" However upon hearing several friends swear up and down how good this book was, I decided to reserve judgement and borrow it from the library.<br /><br />To put it simply, I was dead wrong. Yes, the premise is the same as Battle Royale (children forced to fight to the death to instill fear in the populace and reassure the government of it's absolute control), however that is the only similarity. Saying they are the same would be like saying the Mentalist and Psych are the same - yes, they both have a phoney psychic who solves crimes, but as anyone who has seen both knows, they are very different shows - one is about a men hellbent on vengeance no matter what the cost, it's extremely serious and heartbreaking. The other is a light-hearted comedy.<br /><br />Frankly, the Battle Royale was a wonderful movie, a great horror show, and extremely enjoyable. But it in no way delves into the psychology in the Hunger Games. The BR folks are in a society exactly like our own except that occasionally a middle school class is selected to be killed off. But Hunger Games is set in a far off future, a wasteland where the United States once was, where people regularly starve to death and an iron government controls it's people's every move. It's far more similar to 1984 than Battle Royale (and I've read the BR book, own the movie, and owned several of the graphic novels).<br /><br />More importantly, rather than random teenagers with very little plot development who serve as mere fodder for the ensuing slaughter (as seen in BR), we are given a first person view from Katniss, the main character. Katniss takes the place of her sister in the games, something unheard of since all tributes from her district normally die in a game where 24 people fight to the death.<br /><br />This book is heart-wrenching and a real page turner. And it does all this while not taking things to the grotesque level that BR does (Hunger Games could be read by a teenager, or perhaps a pre-teen, but trust me when I say you do NOT what anyone under the age of 16 reading Battle Royale).<br /><br />Bottom line? This is a good book, and not a rip-off at all. I am definitely going to see the movie if I can scrape up the money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Enjoy the games and ease of use. A little more variety and lower prices on more games but ease of use and instructions are great!!!!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|this app would be awesome if it didn't force close every time you watch one video if you have a kindle fire and are impatient like me I would not reccomend this app for u
B005VTS4EY|3.0|this is more fun than I thought it would be! starts out super easy and progresses to harder puzzles requiring strategy and quick fingers. got it as FAOTD on kindle fire... but worth the buck as normal price!<br /><br />Not long after I wrote fhe original review (this update is 5-26-13), I deleted the app. It started freezing with force stops... and frankly got super boring. Reduced rating to 3 stars from 5 on 5-26-13.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|The writers promised that although not all questions about the island, the others, the Man in Black, etc. might not get answered, the final wrap-up of the series was about the CHARACTERS. And they delivered on this premise. I found Season 6 of \\"Lost\\" to be both harrowing and ultimately rewarding. It's impossible for me to watch without getting choked up about a dozen times. My only disappointment was in the fate of John Locke. He deserved better. But the evolution of Jack Shepard's character more than makes up for this.<br /> Oh. And the little bonus episode \\"New Man in Charge\\" ties up another loose end that was rather annoying to me, since it dealt with a character who was being built up and then seemingly dropped almost completely. I won't spoil it for anyone who doesn't have this DVD set yet.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|After being a avid user of Teamviewer for years, I thought maybe someone came along with a better experience.

0393338398|4.0|It has been over 7 years since I read Moneyball the first time, and I think I enjoyed it even more on this second reading. What strikes me most about this book is how well written it is. Michael Lewis' proses are fun and witty. I really enjoyed this book much more then I had remembered. All I seemed to remember was the baseball, and there is plenty of that. There is however a much larger amount of just great writing. I think many people who would never pick this book up because they think it is a baseball book are missing out on a truly wonderful experience.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|Background: though I find myself at a technical college, surrounded by geeks and nerds just oozing with skill in the arts of small electronics and soldering, I possess little to no talent (let alone patience) in the field.<br /><br />To put it bluntly: this product is the absolute tits when it comes to audio input replacement.<br /><br />The rubber end as well as the plastic clamp both provide longevity and protection not afforded by other brands, and for a lesser price.<br /><br />My previous attempts to fix some high quality headphones using Radioshack replacement inputs never lasted and were difficult to set properly without botching SOMETHING. With this product, though my skill had surely only gone up a fraction as I continued to make the same novice mistakes, was easier to set and secure than I ever imagined was possible.<br /><br />Personally bought a few of them. I must just be bad with headphones; I generally expect that with any new pair, replacing the input is inevitable. Much much cheaper than up and buying new audio equipment. Could also potentially make a little cash/free headphones/beer credit from less inclined friends with headphones they're getting ready to scrap.<br /><br />Yar

B00127RAJY|2.0|I was soooo excited to start my 30 day challenge. I read all the reviews but disregarded the ones where they said they got injured, thinking that it wouldnt happen to me. Well 5 days I was unable to walk and in excruciating pain. The dvd has lots of jumping, squats and twists. So I tore a tendon in my knee. I got.a good sweat and burn so I will go back whene s my knee heals. On to the six week 6 pack for now.<br /><br />Update: april 6th, 2012: so now I have two knees with torn meniscus. The last week I have been unable to walk, squat and bend without pain. I was unable to do any videos or workouts. I am highly discouraged, upset and mad with jillian right now.

0307346617|5.0|It's tough to beat Max Brooks when it comes to writing about the zombie apocalypse. The book is reminiscent of the brilliant \\"The Third World War: A Future History\\" by Sir John Winthrop Hackett, but instead of World War III, Max introduces us to...well, you know. In contrast to a traditional linear novel, the story of World War Z is told through a collection of interviews given by various survivors of the apocalypse -scientists, soldiers, etc-  from all around the globe. While the interviews are many, all are individually unique and fascinating; the story never sinks into redundancy or tedium. Furthermore, the level of accuracy regarding the diverse politics, military procedures, geography, etc. from every part of the world is simply amazing. Brooks definitely didn't slack in his research.<br />There's really nothing I can say about this book that hasn't already been said, so I will praise it along with almost every other reader who has experienced it. Buy it. Read it. Revel in its goodness.<br />Five stars, baby.

0061780308|4.0|I found this book was able to make me care about the characters.<br />I laughed,i cried,i got mad.It was a gift.As a racing fan i was<br />curious about the racing aspect.Chapters are short and the print is large so its an easy read.

B005I4JG80|4.0|The author strikes a nice balance in this book that challenges the issues that many Amrican families face (picky eaters, infant sleep, family balance etc.).  While this doesn't read as a \\"parenting\\" book, the intention is to compare the cultures and allow readers to draw their own conclusions.  I really enjoyed it.
1250006341|5.0|Who is Rose?  On page 78 she states, \\"Thomas, O'Brien, Rose and Ethel would have been content to stay in service....\\"  Who is ROSE?  I own the DVD of both seasons, have watched every episode at least five times, and I can't find one mention of Rose among them.  Also, the cast of characters is listed at the back of the book...and there's not a Rose mentioned.<br /><br />I appreciated the explanation of the bolts of material gifted to the downstairs members at Christmas...now it makes sense.<br /><br />Good book...great series.
B00026WU64|5.0|Good grief, what can you say about this album, but that it is a foundation-stone of modern popular music? Almost every song is classic pure songwriting, a lesson for anyone attempting a \\"serious\\" song. And, the wit and high spirits in \\"Talkin' WWIII Blues\\", \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" and \\"I Shall Be Free\\" demonstrate that Dylan wasn't just a doomsayer or a scold. This album and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" are absolutely necessary for anyone who wants to understand what the 1960s did to popular culture.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use this to stream stuff from my USB attached drive across the WAN. MAC files skip a little, but thats a hardware issue and hardly the fault of the app. Hulu is possible with this app, without crazy nodding or rooting.<br /><br />For the future, could we have an option to connect to another network we're not necessarily on? That would give this 10 stars.

0743270754|4.0|When I purchased this book, it was during the 2008 elections after closing watching Hillary & Obama batteling the Democratic nomination.  After I heard that Obama read this book, he inspired me to read it.  I was disappointed that Hillary did not get the nomination (I still think today, she would of been a stronger President against the Republican gridlock!), but nevertheless Obama won.  It was not unitl recently in 2012 that I finally read \\"Team of Rivals\\" b/c I had to be in a mood to read a huge book about politics.  I read many books about Lincoln b/c this man is my hero and has inspired me!  However I never read a book that took you into the mind of Lincoln and what he may have been thinking to put a cabinet together of men who not only despised him, but thougtht he was incompetent!  That was further from the truth, Lincoln knew to keep his enemies close to get the job done, which was to end the civil war and put an end to slavery, which was inhumane.  Lincoln was an humanitarian who fulfilled his purpose in life.  He paid a dear price, but left a lagacy.  Obama putting Biden & Hillary as part of his cabinet was not only genius, but necessary to face the challenge that he inherited for 8 yrs. of a mess that Bush left!  A MUST READ BOOK!

B007FTZDN8|5.0|The cheese tasted good, and the sauce combined with this fresh tasting cheese had an all around quality taste, almost fruity and juicy if you could imagine. The sauce was solid and not overpowering. I was quite happy with this app.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|The blockbuster \\"Avatar\\" was loosely based on this book as was \\"The Princess of Mars.\\" Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara), the author of the book, plays a part in the film in order to give credence to the tale. The tale is patterned on the common early 20th century belief that Mars was inhabited by a dying race with technology greater than our own.<br /><br />The character of John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is nicely introduced through a series of events that take place in Arizona. Carter, a soldier of the lost cause is suddenly transported to Mars and finds himself part of a different war. Because of the low gravity of Mars, John Carter finds that he can run faster and jump higher than the natives. There are two warring factions of humans and giant green creatures just to add to the mix.<br /><br />Lynn Collins plays the warrior princess who wants John Carter to help her defend her city of Helium. Carter, wants only to return to Earth.<br /><br />This movie is finally a fitting tribute to the works of Burroughs. When you watch it, you think, \\"Oh, this has been done before,\\" or \\"that was taken from Star Wars...\\" But really this wasn't taken from them, they borrowed from Burroughs. Modern movie goers might find this film a bit cliche and trite. As a sci-fi fan who loves 50's sci-fi stuff, this was 5 stars.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Tween safe.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is much more fun then the free Virtual City game. You can get all of the buildings on this just on the free game. Instead of just one little area you can expand your city's area.
B003MC5L9S|5.0|I really like this book. Its direct and to the point. It providers a powerful, useful tool that anyone can tap into for improving one's own life or outcomes. Great price.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the first one I found that can understand. so many of them gave do many varieties, it makes no sense.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I've seen the film at least 10 times and I heartily and almost to a word agree with everything that has been written by the other 5 Star reviews.  All I can add is that I scream at my 55\\" Large Screen TV \\"Go Secretariat, Go!\\" and cry like a sap every time I hear Penny yell \\"Let'em run Ronnie, let'em run\\" and see that horse make the last turn on his path to victory and history at the Belmont Stakes.  I mean every time.<br /><br />I called my girlfriend and briefly discussed the film with her.  A major stoic, she said that she cries too and I asked her why?  Before she had an opportunity to respond I said \\"Perhaps it's because we witness something perfect of heroic proportions doing something it was designed by God to do flawlessly with all of its heart and being.\\"  All she could do is agree.<br /><br />Thank you Disney for this wonderful film in spite of any literary license you may have taken to get the point across.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I saw this book on Good Morning America and  so I downloaded I was pretty shocked because I have never read anything like this but it was a great story and I read all 3 books in 2 days I could not put them down it made me laugh, cry and cheer their love story on. Ias for people saying its poorly written well in my opinion if you are a true reader and throw  your self into the story I assure you that you will overlook all that!
0316017922|5.0|I read this book thinking it would give me tips on how to be more successful, likening it to \\"7 habits of highly successful people\\".<br />This is not the case, but the book is EXCELLENT!<br />What do Bill Gates, the Beatles and the Asian population have in common.  I highly recommend the book for anyone who strives for success.  While not a how to book, it provokes thoughts around what could make me/you an Outlier?  What will the next background be for those born/living in 2012?
B004UID2LC|3.0|this an awesome app but sometimes there's a glich and plays what you watched before it. but over all its a good app
B007IQX1G4|1.0|Dark and depressing, the Mavis Gary character is pathetic disgusting and a horrid person. I like movies to move me but not towards suicide, not sure what the purpose of this movie was but far from entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is pretty fun to play.. I can't stop playing.. lol. I like all the games that you can play and unlock.
B006UG90RM|3.0|I really didn't think this CD would live up.  We all know the Van Halen's are great musicians but I honestly believed they would sell out musically in order to get played on the radio and that couldn't be further from the truth.<br /><br />For me, the songs are better than average and not exactly what I would have expected... with the exception of the lame Roth-inspired \\"Stay Frosty\\" the likes of which at least one gets on every Roth record with Van Halen. (and I rarely like... sorry, my opinion)  I love that it's obvious when they band sat down to write the music, they were not listening to the old records so they didn't turn into a cover band of themselves. This, however, might be why they're not getting much in the way of airplay... a tough spot to be put in, I admit.<br /><br />The voice... well even the Roth fans have to admit the voice isn't what it was.  Sounds more like it was on his later solo records, but with a little more energy since he's now back in the band... still very solid, but not great anymore.  Most of the lyrics are just lame though... same as ever, but just less convincing 25 years later.  It's like listening to Bon Jovi sing about how tough it is to be a \\"working man\\" when he's been making millions of dollars a year for the past 20 years.  If it wasn't for the lyrics, I might have had to give this CD a 4-star rating.<br /><br />Musically though, I think this is one of the best albums they've made since Fair Warning... they really flexed their instrumental muscles here with absolutely stellar musicanship.  Eddie's playing is inspired, Alex's playing is as great as it every was, and though I REALLY would have like to see Michael Anthony on this \\"reunion\\" CD, I gotta admit that Wolfgang sounds like he's been playing with the band from the beginning.  Awesome chemistry.<br /><br />I'm VERY interested to see what the 2nd CD will be like after they've gone on tour and spent some time together... assuming they can still look at each other afterward..
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Simple to use but yet very advanced.  This app does everything with ease. I'm a big fan. Thank you for solving my office document issues.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|Not only was it a good movie that kept me interested! Love all the tidbits of \\"inside\\" info & the politics of how things work- example being - when did we run out of body bags?-lookin into gettin some from Canada...BUT..they figured they'd WAIT!!!!! & see!!!!!  Did Mr Creever take Forsythia-he gave wife a dose & small child, but U dont see him taking any... Did Forsythia work??? I think it did-the blogger was sick & looked it-but he was better then...Informative,more real scenario of how it would be. Not one of them movies that centers on one family & everything always works out so easily for them & stuff falls in their laps almost like magic...& they live happily ever after..NOPE...this is more like the real deal!! will watch again & again..
1469984202|5.0|I bought wool on a whim for a dollar and was amazed.  The ending hooked me for the the next one and it just kept going.  After wool 3 i realized i should have just bought the whole thing to begin with.  Each story is great .  The ending is fine but i still want to know what happens next.  Highly recommend this.
B0043URV5U|4.0|As a long time Bob Seger fan I can't help but enjoy any recording he releases, with the only drawback being the obvious missing hits, although this CD is far better than his first \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD which was released several years ago. I think a Seger fan should be consulted as to what to include in a true Greatest Hits CD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I read the Bible more than I ever have before with this app. I love the many different translations.  The reading plans are a great way to read and study the Bible. The app structure and graphics are pleasing to the eye. I strongly recommend this app to others.
0385534639|4.0|Sometimes when you read a book about something fantastical, like the beautiful and elusive black and white traveling circus in this novel, you find yourself tiring of the beautiful description and flipping ahead to see \\"What happens?\\" Or, the characters just are never solid enough to engage you; you never really care what happens to them. What I loved about The Night Circus was that the beautiful descriptions were there to support the interesting characters and that I did care very much about their destinies. The love triangle of Isabel, Celia and Marco is involving and moving; the rivalry of magicians is intriguing, and the question of the future of the circus kept me reading with great interest to the final pages.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I love this game. It's one of the best hidden objects game I've played on this tablet. Keep making them and I will keep playing them.
B004RCNUH2|2.0|Maybe I'm just learning disabled, but I've gone through quite a few books teaching the fundamentals of several areas, and this one doesn't seem to explain them in a way that's very clear.<br /><br />Hopefully if I decide to continue reading it I will find the rest of it easier to follow, but the graphics and pictures are small which doesn't help.
B005EM8O8O|3.0|This was a fun book to read.  The story was such that it kept me interested from beginning to end.  Not too intense, so I would recommend it to those that like Robert Harris and want to good story to read.

I didn't even realize this was coming out as a movie, and when I found out it made me pick up the pace LOL.  I must read before watching!! Can't wait to finish all three books!  The story draws you completely in on the first chapter.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is great, it has everything you could want in a Bible app. I love all the different versions, all the different Bible plans are great too!! I have recommended this app several times.

1451648537|4.0|I agree with other reviewers that this biography of Steve Jobs provides a lot of insight into the life and personality of one of the most iconic and influential figures in all of modern technology.  I now do understand Jobs' mercurial nature, his bravado, powers of persuasion, quirky and sometimes abusive behavior of others in the workplace, as well as his personal vision and his genius.  For these insights the book is well worth the long read, as I like many others, are curious as to what makes a modern industrial giant like Jobs different from the rest of us.<br /><br />I did find Isaacson's style of writing, recounting parts of hundreds of interviews with dozens of Jobs' associates, competitors, collaborators and family, a bit monotonous and repetitive.  I also agree that the author is not a \\"techie\\", but a biographer, and was not able to get into much of the technical aspects of what makes Apple's products revolutionary -- except at the naive level of the consumer.  Perhaps this is sufficient for the task.  The content of the book is obviously filtered through Isaacson's perspective; no author is completely objective, so I wonder if another biographer would have brought out other details or presented the same information in a different way.<br /><br />One major omission from the book is almost no coverage of the production side of Apple.  Isaacson mentions that Steve Jobs told President Obama that Apple had 300,000 factory workers in China producing its products and that they needed to be supported by some 38,000 engineers.  I feel that the author should have included an entire chapter on what it takes for these factories to produce something like 90 million IPADs in the first year etc.  The details of the amassing of resources, the manufacture, quality control and distribution of Apple's suite of products, and the people who do it, are just as astonishing, interesting and important as the design phase which is covered in the book.<br /><br />I also wonder about the legacy of Steve Jobs.  The book says he will still be an iconic figure in 100 years, and lionized as the likes of Thomas Edison or Henry Ford.  But I wonder if technology will have advanced to such a level in another century that everything Jobs did will seem remote and trivial by that time.  He'll be remembered, of course, but not a household word like \\"Edison\\".the legacy of Steve Jobs.

006091307X|1.0|Don't even bother this book is such a bummer. It's so antagonistically *quirky* it reminds you immediately of the talentless fiction writers sucking up to the teacher in the front of the class who all swore a vow of loyalty to Pynchon and whacky antics. V. is much better. So is Gravity's Rainbow. This book SUCKS. I was so frustrated after finishing it I questioned throwing it out the window. It's just stupid and obvious and all it's got going for it is it's obvious drive to be zany. Word on the street is even Pynchon thought it was a jerk.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is very User friendly and cool but it does most of the work so if your just looking for a little distraction this is your thing.  Works great on kindle fire! :)
1439192812|4.0|This is familiar terrain for Richard Dawkins: the crisp, rational science master patiently unmasking the silly myths and smoke and mirrors of the Religious Studies teachers. This book is an excellent introduction to science. A little dry and stuffy with its own sense of rightness in places, but the various chapters do an excellent job of deconstructing some well known (and some lesser known) myths about how the universe is constructed, and laying out the scientific reasons for how it all comes together in crisp, clear prose.<br /><br />Some of his theories regarding genes came across as slightly socially Darwinist, but this is a long running theme of his work going back to the Selfish Gene. Also, he is prepared to allow for the limitations of science so long as they don't run the risk of undermining some of his cherished anti-religion ideas. For example, in the chapter on the possibility of extra-terrestrial life he concludes that, whether it is uncovered or not, there is absolutely no chance that a creator will be revealed. Ah - there are more things in heaven and earth Horatio...<br /><br />Well worth buying for children as an introduction to science, and scientific method.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was kind of hesitant to read a YA novel, but i was curious and once I started reading this book, I couldnt stop. I kinda thought the nickname \\"pidge\\" was cute, it doesnt seem very cute and unromantic, but I kinda think it fit her. Travis was a little too co-dependent and i just knew it was going to end in some kind of a love gone wrong murder, but i was very glad it didnt! I recommended this to my friends but cautioned on the language and sexual content. Two thumbs up
B004BLTNJI|2.0|There is so little to choose from in 3D that I doubt I'm alone.. I've bought almost everything there is to buy on 3D. Unless you're bonkers over Tim Burton, I recommend skipping this one. Sure the 3D is awesome but everything else is forgettable. 3D for the sake of 3D.
B006YJIIC8|5.0|I love this series.  It is well written with<br />wonderful character development in a beautifully historic  setting.  The acting<br />is superb.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R R Martin is actually a genius.... His attention to detail, complicated story lines, and creation and meticulous maintenance of his fictitious world blow my mind. Everything is really starting to come together and I am tearing my eyes out waiting for the next book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was fantastic! Im a sucker for all things dystopian, so I wanted to read this from the onset. I was not let down. I am a Hugh Howley fan from here on out, and am anxious for more of Juliette and the gang from Silo 18. I want to know what happens in Silo 17, so keep it coming! Read this series, you will not be dissapointed. At this price point, why not?
B007K4E9KQ|4.0|Zooey Deschanel is adorable and so funny. Her wit is perfectly matched in this comedic routine being the fourth roommate among guys.<br /><br />It's almost as if the directors and producers created a modern \\"That Girl\\" starring Marlo Thomas mixed in with today's real Zooey.<br /><br />As far as the reality of paying for a tv show to watch online, I'm not so sure. At least as far as free television goes. This is a fox channel show. Not a show found on HBO, Cinemax or Showtime. And as such, they are aired after 8 days for free on the fox website, and this particular March 13th episode is found here (available in 8 days) for free: (sorry Amazon, had to post a review) [...]<br />I can see, however, the paid cable stations having to charge for movies if we don't have free tv, but right now to pay for something that is readily available to everyone, this doesn't make much sense to me.<br /><br />Hope this review helps. I mean to write an honest take.<br /><br />Enjoy the show! Oh yeah parents, it's not for kiddos. So watch it after you put them to bed. ;)

B0009P5YXO|5.0|Why wouldn't you want to sonic random things if you are a fan of Doctor Who? If having your own sonic screwdriver sounds cool to you, then do not hesitate to buy one! Of course, it can't actually open things and scan things, but you can always use your imagination.<br />Mainly, the screwdriver lights up at the end, emitting a sonicy sound. It has an extender, so that you can extend it to where it is longer, just like the doctor does in the show. On one end there is a pen, that works like a pen does(duh), that can be replaced with a UV pen. When you write a message in invisible ink, it can be revealed by sonicing it with the light from the screwdriver. This pen and invisible ink is a nice feature, and an excuse to pull out a sonic screwdriver when you need to use a pen.<br /><br />But, we all know us Doctor Who fans are getting it so we can sonic doors and random people, while pretending to be the doctor. (= It is very fun to sonic random stuff and annoy people by scanning them. It looks just like it does with the 10th Doctor in the show, and I think every Doctor Who fan needs to have a sonic screwdriver.

0062101897|5.0|I bought this book as a christmas gift. Not being a Harry Potter fan myself, I thought it would be an ok type of book. I did not expect to be drawn into the Potter phenom but I read it and was thrilled by the content. I found the pictures and print very entertaining. Wonderful

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had no desire to read this book... not because I thought it would be bad, how can you go wrong with John Green? Mainly because I didn't want to put myself through a gut-wretching cancer novel that would make me bawl my eyes out. But after reading reviews, I realized it wasn't a depressing book. (Hazel herself says that cancer books suck.) So I read it, and I did bawl my eyes out... but it was definitely worth it. I started at 11 last night and finished at 5 this morning.<br /><br />I fell in love with Gus just like Hazel did, &#34;slowly and then all at once.&#34; The way he talked, the fact that he was pretentious and vain but in the most adorable and hilarious way, the way that he loved Hazel with everything he had.<br /><br />And Hazel was the perfect sarcastic teenage girl with awesome parents and the best sense of humor about her lungs, and how &#34;they sucked.&#34;<br /><br />Maybe I loved it because it's brutally honest, but with just enough humor to ease the pain. Maybe because I wanted to stay in Hazel and Gus's little infinity forever. Or maybe I loved it because it was a fantastic story in every way possible. Whatever the reason, read this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. I was absolutely absorbed and addicted to it. Actually, I was so addicted to it that I read through all 3 books within 2 weeks. That is definitely a record for me.<br />The characters remind me very much of Edward and Bella from Twilight, just not vampires and with a lot more adult substance. However, the intense connection, chemistry, and passion, along with all the secrets and guarded walls each character put up is very similar to that of Twilight. Needless to say, I really enjoyed the book. The first was my favorite of the three, but the other two are definitely worth the read also. Just from my excitement of the books I already have a few friends running to the store to get them.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The first book was great, but in A Clash of Kings, Martin raises both the stakes and the scope, making it, in my opinion, even better than A Game of Thrones.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is an amazing movie, one of the few movies that I watched twice in a row.  While this is not for the person who is looking for your gory or your shoot up bang bang action but it is a really good action movie none the less. It is not really slow pace, more that the intensity builds up, starting small perfectly bringing it up to the climatic moments.  The character background and buildup is amazing, making us understand why the characters are where they are at and why they are willing to do what they do now.  The whole movie is well put together, and believable, there is a flaw or two, but nothing that you really care about because rest of the movie fits together so well. And if you ever thought that a movie about a runaway train could not be insteresting, well then...maybe you need to check this out and see if this will change your mind.
B005LAJ1CC|5.0|I have always been interested and curious about George Harrison, being aware of his talent eclipsed by John and Paul while part of The Beattles. I also knew of his interest in Eastern spirituality but never really found out more about it. This film answers those questions and more. This documentary is extraordinary; of course, what else could we expect of Martin Scorsese!<br /><br />The film documents, primarily based on the archives kept and life experiences shared by his wife Olivia, George's life from early infancy until his departure from this material existence. Along the way the viewer is treated to very rare photographs, intimate interviews with the many people who George deeply touched during this soujourn, home movies, and rare interview footage. We get to see various aspects and facets of the man: his wit, humor, charity, creativity, innovativeness, seriousness, perseverance, compassion, and depth. We also get an inkling about his vulnerabilities, though only by vague mention, his anger and weakness for the ladies, aspects only mentioned, very briefly, by his wife of thirty years, and Paul McCartney, probably to not take away the focus off the remarkable elements of George's life.<br /><br />We also catch sight of his discontent with aspects of the 60's revolution, which, instead of being a mind expansion leading to greater achievements in humanity, it became a regression into useless and self satifying materialism. We also witness his work for the Concert for Bangla Desh, the first rock concert ever organized for charitable purposes and the greatest gathering of prominent artists since Woodstock, and his close involvement in film production with the Monty Python crew -George even morgaged his house so the Python's could produce the Life of Brian.<br /><br />We see George as a musician, a collaborator, a creater, a spouse, a friend, a mystic, and a cool father. You may even have a tear pour out at some point, as Ringo does when he recalls the last words he heard from his friend shortly before disincarnating.heard from his friend shortly before disincarnating.

B004LROMQG|5.0|The third season of Merlin is a continuation of the saga of the character Merlin. Knowing he has a destiny intertwined with Prince Arthur's future while trying to keep his magical talent secret because magic is forbidden by Arthur's father is no easy task for Merlin and makes for some challenging and comical scenes.  Morgana plays more of a part now that she is aware of her magical capabilities, but chooses to use it in more of an evil way.  The characters are great and the acting is very good.  There are episodes that leave you routing for the good side, episodes that add to the mystery and episodes that make you laugh.  I recommend it for older children that aren't afraid of a few mean looking characters.  My teens love it.  My son loves it so much he's reading the books of Merlin by TA Barron.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I am by no means a hardcore Anime fan but I enjoy and appreciate the art of the animation medium. I had seen the original EVANGELION TV series on DVD back in the late `90s and enjoyed the series. When I saw this remake and it's second part (2.2 You Can (Not) Advance), I was blown away by the quality of direction, story and technical achievement. This is a fresh, complicated, original and highly moving storyline that bears multiple viewings and maybe even some research online to really drill down and understand the complexities of the story's characters and actions.<br /><br />I was also very impressed with the marriage of traditional and digital animation by this director and crew of artists. I've seen a lot in the world of animation storyboarding and direction over the decades but this film had me re-winding to see some amazing action sequences again and again. This is a film series that many artists learning the trade today should study.<br /><br />I cannot possibly top the well written and detailed reviews of others here in describing plot or other important details of this film series production. Just wanted to toss in my two-cents and recommend this volume and it's follow up, 2.2, to fans of the genre or students of animation in general.<br /><br />EVANGELION is not for children nor those who have no tolerance for the sci-fi or Anime genres in general. But judging by how my daughter reacted to seeing it for the first time, this series should please a great many teens and young adults looking for more depth and complexity in their characters than just young heroes who venture off in giant robots to defend humanity from strange creatures

0439813786|5.0|Fun story with fantastic pictures. The pictures tell the story in very good detail. I finished the book in two days. However, more time could be spent just enjoying the drawings. I am interested to see the movie now that I have read the book.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|To classify this movie in a specific genre would be impossible. At times I was laughing, at other times my eyes were filling with tears, some were tears of sorrow, some were teas of joy.<br /><br />George Clooney's character ( Matt King) is a member of a prominant family. He must enjoy law, because a mountain of family wealth is not enough to keep him from working as a layer. His life is complicated to say the least. His wife is in a critical coma, his daughters are his soul responsibility, and one is a teenager (Shaileen Woodley; \\"Secret Life\\") that seems to define rebellious. The other is younger and affected by her mother's health more than her sister. Matters are complicated again and again, and I'll leave out the details as there are a lot of spoiler-moments and I don't do that.<br /><br />The most important question: \\"Is the movie any good?\\" Well I can honestly assure you that it is. George Clooney always performs, and a seasoned director that seems born for this film allows all of the actors to shine. The storyline takes you on an unforgettable journey down what I can best describe as a \\"smooth road\\". Everything comes together seamlessly, and the movie feels both modern and somewhat classic.<br /><br />The movie is directed by Alexander Payne. If the name is not familiar to you, he was responsible for \\"Sideways\\" released in 2004, if you haven't seen that film, then this one will be a good ice-breaker to his style of directing. He is known for mixing elements of comedy, drama, and tragedy, and blending them to be oddly well-balanced. He succeeded in doing so in this movie and I believe it is his best work yet.<br /><br />Though there are some tear-jerking moments, and misfortune seems to be constantly looming presence, the movie is a long shot from being a full-blown tragedy or drama.The film flows nicely from scene-to-scene, even though those scenes can be night and day in contrast. My hubby doesn't care for either of those genres and he liked The Descendents. He called it \\"well balanced\\" and I couldn't agree more. This film could fit into any collection. It is as versatile as a movie can be, and I appreciate it for that.. He called it \\"well balanced\\" and I couldn't agree more. This film could fit into any collection.

B005FITIK0|1.0|I brought this movie home looking for a good laugh. There were none. I did not see any comedy in this train-wreck. Actually it was quite sad. Don't rent this movie looking for a good comedy. This movie does not have anything funny in it. I don't see the humor in watching a mentally disturbed, alcoholic floundering around in life. The story takes forever to get off the ground, and left me feeling anything but humorous.

0670022950|5.0|The answer to that question is a resounding \\"NO\\"!<br /><br />People were much more violent in the past than in the present; going back 5 years, 15 years, 25 years, 150 years, 500 years and 5,000 years.  Our ancestors massacred, enslaved and tortured each other on a very frequent basis.<br /><br />This nearly 700 page book asks this question, as well as the questions, 'why have violence and crime declined', 'why are (American) Southerners more violent than Northerners' and 'why is American more violent than other similar states'?<br /><br />As a reader of mostly academic books that cite peer-reviewed papers, this one is excellent and well researched.  I highly recommend this book to others, particularly conservatives that evangelize about the 1950s and liberals that romanticize about the \\"Noble Savage\\".
B002LVUKIS|2.0|Its been half a day and my buddy and I still do not have all the bugs worked out on this game. I did find a decent patch exe. that got Thief Gold up and running, but Thief 2 does not work at all and does not read that I have direct x installed. So I gave up on that one and Thief Deadly Shadows runs well but it keeps freezing, especially after every save and load I make. I have not yet figured out a good patch for this as well. I am running this on xp with an updated video card gtx 580. I run xp so I can play some of the older nostalgic games of my choosing.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games is a decent light read. The book does nothing new in terms of dystopia future narratives. The only gripping part is the fact that kids are killing one another. If it weren't for the shocking juvenile violence this would have been a fairly flat read.
B005FJ7DOM|3.0|I was okay. Someone else said that it's similar to The Road with vampires....very true. The vampires were cool, the acting was good, but the story was not really what I was expecting I guess. It's more storyline like The Road and less Zombieland like I thought it would be.
0060557818|5.0|The book reminded me a lot of Kraken.  That's not exactly fair as i know Neverwhere came out in 1996 and Kraken in 2010.  But you're affected by when you read things.  I'm not sure who's scarier, Croup and Vandemar or Goss and Subby but I'm sure they'd get on fabulously together, Croup and Goss talking each other's ears off while Vandemar and Subby played with knives or something.  There were other similarities: the side-by-side Londons, mysticism, magic, double-crosses.  Very good though, if you've liked one then you'll like the other.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I have so much respect and gratitude for our service men & women, the training they endure and the time away from home.  I had to put the \\"book\\" down so I could eat and work. A good combination of intensity, humor and emotion.

B006LEHOL2|5.0|Since Sinead has been making music I have been a fan but I have been waiting a long time for this album. Sinead has a rare ability to convey the full range of human emotions in a way that the listener can immediately identify with and say \\"yep, I've been there too\\". She achieves this through unexpected lyrics, melodies that immediately soothe or shock and the inflection of her voice. On this album, this happens time and time and time again. We've been longing for these classic Sinead moments and she's given us them in abundance on this record. The hairs on the back of your neck will stand up as she tells her stories and you relate the words to your own life. The stand out tracks for me are Old Lady, Back Where You Belong, The Wolf is Getting Married, Queen of Denmark and Very Far From Home...oh wait, that's almost half the album!!!!!
B005KELW26|4.0|The Kindle Fire Folio was a nice protective cover for the fire.  However, it was the same folio made for the earlier Kindle.  Granted, the fire was a new product but why make the folio sound exclusively for the fire.  A bit of eyewash to promote a product that already exist.

0439023521|4.0|You know a book is good when its name is much more known than the author.  I suppose that's every author's dream--to write a book that stands on its own and becomes a standard household name.  So popular, this book will be released as a movie later this week.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins follows Katniss Everdeen as she enters the games.  She lives in District 12, the lowest of twelve.  Every year, each district must provide two tributes: one male, one female to compete to the death.  The last one standing wins his or her district a year of increased food rations.  So all Katniss has to do is outlive twenty-three opponents.  Sound easy enough?<br /><br />The story is exciting.  The characters are all different and fun.  These two aspects alone give this book its uncommon success.  The writing itself is just average.  You won't find many quotables beyond what the characters say.  The writing mostly does a good job of staying out of the way so the reader can enjoy the story (a technique I'm good at, myself).<br /><br />Yet the book does have its slow parts.  Most notably, the first few pages.  Many incomplete sentences.  Even some character's quotes.  When I first picked up the book, I fell asleep around page 4.  If I didn't already know what a smashing success the book was, I might have stopped.  When I asked my kids and friends about it, they replied, \\"Yeah, all three books start out really slow, but then they pick up quickly.\\"  What's funny is that when the action picks up, the incomplete sentences disappear.  And when the action wanes and we see a little respite, the incomplete sentences come back en masse.  I found myself wishing Collins had done just one more round of editing to smooth some of these out and improve the flow.<br /><br />And I think back to the advice we aspiring writers are given: Grab your readers on the first page.  Perhaps this is easily overcome by an awesome story that everyone wants to read.<br /><br />Collins chooses to write in first person present, which means you see the action exactly as it's occurring from Katniss's point of view.  This also means that you don't know if she's going to die or not.  You know it's possible for the book to end this way: \\"I'm dying.  They won.  Those jerks!\\"  It's takes a while to get used to this, but then you don't notice it anymore.  The most challenging part of this technique is dealing with the passage of time, and Collins does well.<br /><br />This is a YA book, so go ahead and let your kids read it.  The book is graphic without going into every last gory detail.  The dialogue is contentious without resorting to vulgar language.  The book concentrates mainly on the story and how people react, as all good books should.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book (after getting past the first chapter), and I'm looking forward to the movie that comes out later this week.write in first person present, which means you see the action exactly as it's occurring from Katniss's point of view.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really did love this book! To me, it was a bit hard to get into, but once I hit chapters 3 and 4, I was in love. The contrast between the dark - almost macabre - and the background story was fantastic. Adding the pictures and a story for each of the pictures completely portrayed the Authors imagination. I'd recommend it to anyone any day. Just make sure to keep an open mind; It's definitively different, but great none-the-less.

0066620996|5.0|In politics, it has been said that the perfect is the enemy of the good. Author and management researcher Jim Collins turns that notion on its head and says, \\"Good is the enemy of the great.\\" The difference is this: In the political arena, the pedantic striving for the perfect legislative bill (in the eyes of its sponsors) doesn't take into account the need for compromise; thus the good can be all too easily sacrificed with nothing achieved because nothing passes the vote. Collins is not talking about compromise. He is talking about performance; and leads the reader into a detailed examination of some truly superior performing companies and what characteristics distinguish them above the merely good performers.<br /><br />Collins gives the first hint on where he's headed on pages 15-16: \\"It [the book] is not about business per se. It is ultimately about one thing: the timeless principles of good to great. It's about how you take a good organization and turn it into one that produces sustained great results, using whatever definition of results best applies to your organization.\\" Collins says the reason he used publicly traded companies to study is because the data is easily accessible and there is a widely agreed upon definition of results. But he sees it as a human problem. \\"If we have cracked the code on the question of good to great, we should have something of value to any type of organization.\\" The book itself delves into interesting details on business performance but a \\"monograph\\" accompanies the book covering the \\"social sectors.\\"<br /><br />My criticism of business books in general (as well as self-help books) is that the authors tend to recycle old ideas by creating new terminology, a separate language if you will, and make fine distinctions where there are no real differences. How else are you going to sell books if there is nothing \\"new\\" in it? Collins could be accused of some of that, e.g. \\"The Stockdale Paradox\\" and \\"The Hedgehog Concept,\\" but there are a few surprises. The biggest surprise to me was that I never heard of the CEO's from the 11 companies chosen as great out of the 1435 companies examined! The great companies selected were Abbott Laboratories, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly-Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Philip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreen, and Wells Fargo--and there isn't a \\"charismatic\\" messianic celebrity leader among them. Empirical data showed some findings \\"inside the black box:\\"<br /><br />Ten of the eleven CEO's came from inside the company.<br />Executive compensation was not a key driver in performance.<br />All companies have long-range strategies but the great companies spent no more time on them than poorer performers.<br />Great companies focused not only on what to do but equally what not to do.<br />Technology can accelerate transformation from good to great but it cannot cause it.<br />Mergers and acquisitions played virtually no role. Two mediocre companies joining just make a bigger mediocre company.<br />Great companies don't spend time motivating people; they hire motivated people and create the conditions that secure commitment and continued motivation. Some companies kill it.<br />There were no big events that signaled transformation.<br />Some great companies are in terrible and unexciting industries, e.g. Philip Morris, yet perform remarkably well.<br /><br />The key characteristics of companies that moved from good to great:<br /><br />The leadership style requires personal humility and dogged professional will--\\"more like Lincoln and Socrates than Patton or Caesar.\\" Collins calls this \\"Level 5 Leadership.\\"<br />\\"First Who...Then What.\\" First get the right people on the bus in the right seats, and then figure out your vision and strategy of where you're going.<br />\\"Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith).\\"<br />\\"The Hedgehog Concept\\"--a crystal clear but simple blending of understanding \\"what you can be the best in the world at,\\" and \\"what you are deeply passionate about\\" plus what drives your economic engine?

There is no grand moment but success breeds success.<br /><br />With that as background, the monograph accompanying the book looked at the social sectors and \\"why business thinking is not the answer.\\" Collins sees parallels but notes some differences also, offering some excellent examples, which he discusses:<br /><br />Defining \\"Great\\"--calibrating success without business metrics, i.e. what is success? It can involve qualitative measurements, e.g. the Cleveland Orchestra.<br />\\"Leadership--getting things accomplished within a diffuse power structure, e.g. the Girl Scouts.<br />Getting the right people on the bus within social sector constraints, e.g. dealing with the teacher's union if you're trying to build a great school or department.

Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline.\\"<br /><br />This is a very forceful statement!

B00004ST9Q|5.0|I originaly ordered this DVD to have a high quality video of Whitney's \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" at Super Bowl XXV.  I love this performance, it always brings tears to my eyes.  I was very surprised to hear many of the songs that I love so much on the same DVD.  It is truly a treasure to me, her beautiful clear voice and the range of her voice are amazing.  The joy she has given me and the world, with her voice, will always be a blessing to us all.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I have loved this series since I first saw it on TV a few years back. I am now watching it on Foxtel in Australia with my daughter and just could not resist buying my own copy - it is so well done I don't believe it is not a documentary!  If I ever visit the White House, I would expect to see all of the main caracters there:)
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|I really don't understand the hatred for this title.  It's not meant to be a 'Raging Bull' or 'Dog Day Afternoon' (&lt;-- highly overrated I think anyway).  It's a kids movie.  I went and saw this in the theater with my son, wife and mother right after Thanksgiving and bought the soundtrack right away.  My SON loved it!  Remember that's who this movie is aimed at and as such it works wonderfully.  Was it predictable?  Of course it was.  We're not talking about 'The Usual Suspects' so don't rate it as such.<br />Rate it as something that'll make a child tap his feet, identify with Eric, and laugh at the antics.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|\\"Strangers In The Night\\" has long been hailed by classic rock fans as one of the great all time live albums and indeed it does live up to the hype.  This album served as a coming out party for guitar phenom Michael Schenker who absolutely smokes throughout the disc, especially on the lengthy \\"Rock Bottom\\".  The album has been remastered with 2 new tracks added that present the concert in the correct order that it happened.  Everything on this album clicks and serves as the high water mark of a band that should have been a lot bigger than they ever got (at least here in the U.S.).  If you are a fan of 70's hard rock this album is essential listening.
0439023491|4.0|I was so excited to read this book!  I absolutely loved the first one and wondered how the story would continue.  I was not disappointed! In this sequel, Katniss finds herself in the center of a growing unrest in the country.  She begins to realize she has unwittingly fueled a rebellion against the Capitol and although she whole-heartedly believes in it, the stakes are high.  She finds herself confused about her feelings for both Gale and Peeta.  This year's Games are the 3rd Quarter Quell, meaning the 75th anniversary of the start of the Hunger Games.  Every 25 years is a big \\"celebration\\" and a new surprise of sorts for the Games, this time is no different and comes as a huge shock to much of the country.  To top it all off, Katniss has to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that she is truly in love with Peeta, and soon realizes nothing she does will be enough.<br />This book is full of danger, suspense and surprises.  I can actually feel the emotions Katniss goes through and feel for her predicament between the two young men in her life.  When the book was finished, I had to force myself to go to bed and not just continue reading the next book!<br />I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars!

B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I was satisfied until I needed to unlock a file. Now I am just annoyed. I got the kindle for my nonlinear textbooks, but I cannot unlock them due to adobe limitations. How hard is it to give an unlock option, or the power to delete a file? Please change this.
B0076D20E8|3.0|This seemed like a great concept, but it lost something in translation. It seemed to loose a degree of direction in the overly ambitious concept. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, but the execution was a little bit confused. Consequently, I just became a little bit bored at points and almost gave up on the movie. But I did not, but only because the director attempted to do something very unusual and interesting. All in all, it took some effort to work my way through this historical thriller. Get it and give it a shot if you dare.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|it works for what its sopost to do but it could be atleast a little bit better. sometimes it is not accurate and doesn't work right but is still good. I don't really think its worth the money.

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I've been to Maui once, and heard a few of the great artists there, and the music in the film brings it all back.  This movie will be a classic one day, and this music will be heard around the world, fabulous.  I loved the space of the filmmaker in using this music to reflect on the things the characters were going through.  The movie works on so many levels, and the Music is a major force that ties the indigenous people's culture to this land, and to the film itself.  As a film composer, blues and roots musician, it's nice to see the director use the right music for a particular place in time.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|When I saw this on opening day in a theater with about a dozen other people present, I found it to be both not as bad as I had feared, and not as good as I had hoped.  Credit must be given for the cleverness of combining the seemingly exhausted found-footage horror genre, with the realistic historic space exploration genre, while using a significant amount of real archival footage and using mostly period-accurate equipment to capture the new footage.  The result is something that costs very little to make, yet is fairly convincingly real more often than expected.  This is also clever in that it appeals in different ways to the established audiences for found-footage horror, science fiction, docudrama, and conspiracy theory drama audiences.  With just a modest initial weekend draw on each of those special-interest audiences, the film easily made back it's estimated 5 million dollar budget. Two big caveats which may be very specific to a very small population other than myself: I am a sucker for anything Apollo-related, and I don't care that the film was never for even a moment even slightly scary.  I don't go to movies to squeal like a schoolgirl at cheap scare tactics, so I was not disappointed when my pulse remained steady. And after all of that rather jaded criticism, I must say it really was an honest and mostly successful attempt to make an interesting and involving film.  No offense to the director, but this is very much a film created through a combination of many hours of largely improvised performances from good, understated actors, and a very fast-working and creative editing and audio post production team.  The only significant failure of this film was in not conveying any real sense of just how terrifying it must have been for the real Apollo astronauts, even on missions that went mostly by the book.  It is hard to imagine just how absolutely hostile to human life the environment outside of those tiny spacecraft and EVA suits really is.  The unusually lengthy selection of cut, extended, and alternate scenes on this DVD/Blu-Ray release are an enjoyable diversion, giving much insight into the process of making the film.gthy selection of cut, extended, and alternate scenes on this DVD/Blu-Ray release are an enjoyable diversion, giving much insight into the process of making the film.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I recently started working out again. I have been to the gym before, but have never been a big fitness buff and my knowledge of working out was relatively limited. I had been going to the gym for about 5 weeks before I came across this book. The best thing about it in my opinion is that in the beginning it defines the terms specific to the science of working out and dieting, which makes it easy to read and understand for anyone.<br /><br />It gave me a very structured routine to follow while at the gym, which allows me to be as productive as possible with the time I have.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!!!!! I usually don't play games but in love with this. I recommend this for any body. My kids even love it. The mini games are great. and I like to earn more points.

B003K16P3M|5.0|I have had Graceling on my to-read list for a couple of years now. I've tried to start it several times and stopped. My sister encouraged me to keep reading and with the advent of the sequel coming out, I tried again and I am very glad I did.<br /><br />Graceling is about Katsa, a strong female protagonist with the Grace of killing, who meets her match in Po, another Graced fighter. This book is her journey in learning more about herself, more about developing relationships with others and introduces yet another fascinating character who entitles her own future book, Bitterblue.<br /><br />Cashore's strengths do not lie in the beginnings. Like I said, it was hard to get into, although elegantly written. The strength lies in the meat of the story; the beginning of the book is like a smouldering flame that develops into a raging fire. Once I got 35% through the book, I could not put it down. Cashore develops her characters with great love and admiration. I absolutely loved Po and Bitterblue; and I greatly admired Katsa and empathized with her situation. What working woman has not stressed about the balance between marriage/kids and career? And in Katsa's world, marriage and kids are tantamount to a career and so she has the impossible decision of having to decide between one and the other. I was also chilled to the bone when introduced to the antagonist in the story; and the way this was dealt with was priceless.<br /><br />I was surprised that this was not the end of the story. I loved how it ended and thought it beautifully written. I am impressed and looking forward to reading Bitterblue in the near future.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I went ahead and purchased this because of all of the hype. I am 20 years old and typically indulge in Young Adult fiction.<br />TL;DR upfront: It's an engrossing, gripping, and beautifully crafted series. I pummeled through this book in NO time at all.<br /><br />Promptly went out and found a copy of the second, and the third. These books were done in two days flat. They are that gripping.<br /><br />The first book still wins out in terms of storytelling and plot development, but i promise you will get hooked and love the second two as well.<br /><br />VERY recommended to all YA readers and those of us who enjoy a good character driven tale :]
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very helpful application. I use it every day. Sometimes it freezes.<br />But anyway is really accurate and looks good. Just hit the icon or the widget and get a full weather report.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|A bit of a slow start, but the movie quickly took off and kept running.  All the wonderful humor, for both kids and adults, that you'd expect out of a Muppets film. A fan of these guys since their debut on tv in the '70s, I couldn't be happier to see them being introduced to a new generation. If you are a muppet fan, watch this film!

B003YYKPMM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It seems more allegorical than realistic, and yet, mirrors real life situations in which people come together and inexplicably become more than the sum of their parts.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT** The catalyst for this change arrives in the person of a German tourist, stranded in the Nevada desert (I lived in such places- anyone who's been to Burning Man can tell you the desert is indeed magic, not as far-fetched as you'd think). She has no clothes, no prospects, and is initially shunned by the odd assemblage of characters who populate the rundown motel and truck stop- and yet, she blossoms, prevails, and alchemically alters everyone around her.<br /><br />A delightful reworking of Pollyanna, perhaps, quirky and unpredictable in the extreme. Lovely Marianne S&auml;gebrecht, an eventually incandescent C.C.H. Pounder (who played Moat, Neytiri's mother in Avatar), Jack Palance, George Aguilar, Apesanahkwat as Navajo Sheriff Arnie- all are inspired.<br /><br />There's LIFE, magic to be found, even in the most remote and seemingly hopeless of places, one need only look for it. Hear, hear!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it...lots of fun and challenging plus its free tons of games that are addictive will keep you entertained for hours
B003L77G8I|2.0|I have enjoyed Bones from the git-go, for its sometimes-gritty subject matter, interesting police procedural depictions, and the byplay between the main characters. However, in the sixth season, the series has become a soap opera about relationships, pregancies, and cutesy people occasionally interrupted by the cases. I'm outta here!
B004SGWYW4|4.0|To some people, anime is a genre filled with graphic violence, unnecessary sex, gratuitous nudity, and girls with big breasts, ripped-off clothing, and skimpy underwear.  HOTD will fully live up to - or down to - these stereotypes.  It is also 12 episodes of guilty pleasure, with zombies.<br /><br />For some unexplained reason, a plague has broken out all over the world, that turns people into \\"them\\". (The word \\"zombie\\" is never used)  But \\"they\\" shamble around, make weird noises, and bite people, their bite being rapidly fatal.  This doesn't end the story, because it seems that zombies, like Mormons, have the ability to convert the dead.  So the plague grows exponentially, and chaos ensues.<br /><br />When a local high school becomes infected, the intrepid survivors break free in the school bus, and search for friends, family and sanctuary, in a horror-comedic race against time (and, of course, zombies).  Most of the episodes follow a band of six escapees: the useless school nurse, who seems to exist only to rub her assets against everyone else; the spoiled rich girl who shouts a lot and keeps her hair impeccably groomed, and four kids who can fight, including a dark-haired kendo girl who acts like a demented Aoyama Motoko and whom I found the most engaging of the bunch.  There are also some amusing cameos poking fun at Japanese culture.<br /><br />There is no real closure: the show just sort of stops, so perhaps there will be a sequel.  However, my copy differed a little from the Amazon data given above.  Its aspect ratio is not 4:3, but 16:9.  It is rated locally as NC-16, which I think is about right.  And there is at least one \\"edited\\" version out there, so before you buy check that every episode is exactly 24 minutes long.

B004SBQGHS|3.0|I honestly can't see why this is such an &quot;amazing&quot; game. There are multiple reasons why I don't think this app is very fun.<br /><br />At first, the game is fun, you shoot some birds and kill some pigs, but there are WAY too many levels. At least 100 from my estimation. The game just ends up being repetitive.<br /><br />Second, the Angry Birds idea is completely overused. I can understand a medium sized physics game like Angry Birds having a sequel maybe, but with the size that it is it would be fine without. Instead, there are two other games like it.<br /><br />I would recommend getting the free one.

1400069289|5.0|I've reprised my review as it did not do justice to this book.<br /><br />Some habits are obvious.  We learn to crave our coffee in the morning. We learn to over eat when stressed and anyone who has had a nicotine or gambling habit has learned to use these habits as crutches or amusements. So knowing that; What can we do about them?<br /><br />The author sheds some light on what will work and what won't.  First the habit is a series of Events: Routine, Reward, Cue.  Once we understand the habit we can adjust it.<br /><br />While this book is not so much a self-help on dealing with poor habits (but it helps), it is a primer for understanding what habits are. Understanding this we can learn to manage them and make them into better habits. If you think you know habits, think again, some of the information was very new to me.<br /><br />How companies respond to various events can make or break them. Much of this response is due to internal habits and an informal structure, you won't find in any new hire manual.  How do you get in there and change things?<br /><br />Similarly a society has all sorts of rules for its behavior.  Peer pressure is a form of a society's habitual behavior and this can change that same society in the process.<br /><br />I found this book hard to put down. The author chocked this full of examples and data, which was easy to understand and compelling to read.  In my case I felt it forced me to consider some of my bad habits and pledge to work on changing them, or at least mess with them (still working on it)<br /><br />Since, I had the readers advanced edition and the section: \\"A reader's guide to using these ideas\\"  was not included, I can't comment on this.<br /><br />Some idea what is covered from the table of contents with my commentary.<br /><br />HABITS OF INDIVIDUALS:<br />* Habit loop: Routine, Reward, Cue<br />* Craving train:<br />* Golden rule of Habit change: Substitution<br />In this section they talked of people who lost weight and kept it off, as well as smokers, alcoholics and drug addicts that learned successful substitutions for their negative habits. This is why Alcoholic Anonymous works: Substitution and realizing people with these issues need daily support.  This is the habit that replaces the vice.<br />Within this chapter you can see what they did, to deal with the habits and something just might work for you.<br /><br />HABITS OF SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATIONS<br />* Keystone habits or the ballad of Paul O'Neill: Focusing on Safety and the need for follow up; opened a line of communication, that enabled fundamental change in the organization.<br /><br />* Starbucks and the habit of success: Good habits make good workers.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have been using the Garmin 405CX for about a year now and have simply loved it!  I've since ordered one for each of my running/training partners(three of them) and they all love their watches too.  We do our speed and tempo work individually during the week and meet up on Saturday mornings for the long runs.  It's fantastic to keep everyone in sync (and accountable - the watch don't lie).<br /><br />I do recommend Garmins refubished products since they all come with a one year limited warranty and you can't beat the prices.  Awesome deal from seller \\"Robert A Marks\\".

B004XANKVO|5.0|I go through a lot of bags. I think I found a winner here. I'm very impressed by the strong zippers and material. It's big enough for my 15-inch MacBook Pro, which is parked inside a BookBook case. There is also room for my iPad with its BookBook case. In the bottom of the main bay I took the velcro separators from my last bag and inserted them there. That gives me room to compartmentalize for my Nikon D7000, lenses and flash. There is still plenty of room left over for other odds and ends. I'll be carrying this bag for a long time. I highly recommend it!

B006UKC566|1.0|What a waste, Greek and Roman mythology is ripe for the movie screen especially with the technological advances.  A movie is more than a visual experience, it must lay a foundation of characters, to know about and care about. This movie just seems like a lead in to a sequel, which I will not see.  This is SyFy movie of the week (not a compliment).
B005K17RU0|5.0|love the features especial ly. the maps and radar.  good sharing features too.  fast and accessible. fun features too. good photos.
B0067R0APK|1.0|why the heck with this program, a weather application, need just about every android permission there is? especially if they don't even explain them to you, why would anybody in their right mind buy this app?
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I'm truly impressed with this trilogy.  The action is so fast-paced that you literally have no idea what to expect next, except that it will probably be horrible.  For some books that might be a detraction, but I think it does an excellent job of getting across how the characters in Maze Runner would have felt. not understanding where they are or even who they are, or why their lives are in such chaos and danger.  I enjoyed the whole series immensely and found it hard to put down.<br /><br />I do have a few minor things I thought could have been done better.  The description of the Maze itself was awesome, but I found myself thinking that the explanation for why it was built was just a little unsatisfying.  If the only reason for it was the reason given, then a much less grand structure would have done just as well and possibly better.  But that's a minor thing which didn't by any means spoil the story.<br /><br />The other thing I thought could have been improved was characterization. It wasn't done badly, mind you, but I would have liked to understand Thomas more.  The setting was so surreal and the memory loss so complete, I guess it was hard to put myself in his shoes and imagine how I might react or think in a situation which is so utterly unlike anything I've ever experienced.  Maybe that also was intentional, and maybe it would have been difficult to do much character exploration when the characters can't remember any background about themselves, but it had the side-effect of making it harder to connect with them emotionally.<br /><br />That said, I really loved the books and I'd recommend them wholeheartedly.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  I know people that are so like many of the characters...black and white. The lead black characters, Aibileen and Minny, are worthy heroines. I've got to watch this again very soon!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!!! But I HATE 'Hyperspace'... as well as 'Aquarium '. Other than that, I love this game!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is a page turner of a book. I got hooked on book one and can't wait to continue to the end. If you like dragons, kings, mystery, intrigue from the days of old...then you should read the books.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I was completely impressed with it but it was still short! I hope the Spartacus Vengeance dose a good justice!!
B005XN3150|5.0|Don't be fooled by the first episode! It starts off slow, but there is a reason for it. The whole show is based around character building, which if you like to read, it's really not a problem. The beginning sets up everything. After that, the pace picks up and every episode has you at the edge of your seat at one point. The characters are fantastic, the acting and story line is amazing, and the twists have you talking about the series nonstop until the next episode. The series is great for anyone over 10. So for the most part the whole family can watch. The only reason I say over 10 is there is a lot of talking and some dark moments among the characers. Kids younger than 10 would have a hard time sitting through it. Overall it is worth the money and time to watch this series.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this book after reading about all the hype about it I too wanting to know why Mom's are forgetting to pick there kids up from school cause there engrossed in the book. That said I read all 3 books in one weekend because I keep looking for more then just sex,sex and more sex. Don't get me wrong there is nothing bad about a little kinky in a book but come on they put rabbits to shame can anyone say Ouch I liked the characters Christian Grey is sexy, dark, rich, powerful typical bad boy that I love in a book oh and yes he smells good since Ana said it about 500 times,Ana was the underdog,plain girl who this man bumps and must have forever. If I had to pick to stars to play the parts in the movie Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattenson would be it cause throughout the book thats who I pictured cause this is a dirty twilight forbidden love, possesive guy,dark past,super rich family,even a doctor for a parent, they fall apart when not togther but no vampires.Thank god with kindle you can highlight a would and insantly get the meaning cause I was lost on quite a few words and I'm an avid reader. The book has potential I wanted so must more then it had to offer and the repeating of the same phrases over and over we get it she blushes at everything. I was left wanting to know more about Taylor, Mrs Robinson, Mia, Elliot all interesting people I felt could have been explored more if the 45 sex scene were cut down in amount and detail and who calls a you know what \\"MY SEX\\". I give the author credit though because I cant write books .
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think people were expecting that,and thats why they gave them bad scores.But that's not how the hunger games works.They are brutal books,so no wimps that are not ready for death or madness should be reading them.
0736092269|5.0|This book is beautiful! It appeals to me as an artist, as an athlete, AND as an information glutton.<br />Very clearly organized, clearly labeled, and precise. At first the level of detail in the drawings and labels can be overwhelming, but you begin to filter out the information you don't need, and realize it is nice to have it there in case you do need it!<br /><br />I'm not sure why people are purchasing this book looking for workout plans or nutritional information, as I can't imagine that the title, cover image, or library categorization could possibly make the content of this book more clear. It is a reference manual, and is perfect for anybody who wishes to have a greater grasp on exactly what's going on under the surface. I keep it beside my workout plans and other books to ensure that I am hitting all the muscles evenly and efficiently, and it helps me mix and match, or find replacements when something doesn't work for me. This level of detail in a fitness book would be excessive.<br /><br />This might be the best money I've ever spent in the pursuit of fitness.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Something for a variety of ages! Kids and adults will enjoy these fun and short games. The more you play, the more there is to play!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|but once again the developers are too lazy to support my phone this weather application would be so much better than weatherbug it's not funny. you guys need to fix it not nix it.<br /><br /> there are too many apps that will not run on the lg optimus that unless we all rate it 1 we will be a forgotten phone and left behind. fellow lg optimus users need to stand up and say work harder on supporting us!
B005D63RQK|1.0|Pretty unhappy with the service.  There is no easy way to track what you watch, like Netflix who shows you what you watch.  If you have accidently ordered a redundant episode, there is no way to undo it.<br /><br />Lame, guess its Netflix or god forbid, Apple TV
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Many reviewers must not have further explored this app after installing and launching it.<br /><br />First, there has been criticism of the lack of a widget even though the description makes great mention of widgets.  In the case of this app, the widgets referenced are the various customizable blocks of information you see in the product images.  There are numerous settings for customizing the amount of information displayed as well as the way it is displayed.  These widgets are also available to be shown on your devices homescreen.  The reason, it seems, that so many people are complaining about the lack of a widget is that on many devices there are installed in a location where they are not recognized.  I had to go to Manage Applications in the settings area.  Once there, I selected Weather+.  I noticed an option to move the app to the phone.  Once I did that, three Weather+ widgets appeared at the top of my widgets list.  But considering they are the same blocks of information you see in the pictures I was actually disappointed.  I would have preferred a small, simple one that provides the current conditions.  If I want current conditions by Weather+ on my homescreen I get a giant widget that takes up half the screen.  I use an alternate weather widget for current conditions and then the five day forecast by Weather+.  By the way, I primarily use this on a Droid X2.  On a tablet it is much nicer as all the available widgets can just reside in one corner of the screen (or however you prefer, of course).<br /><br />Second, with regard to the lack of updating, the visible differences in indicated weather from this to other apps, and the source of the weather.  I noticed that the widget on my home screen had shown the temperature had dropped 9 degrees while Weather+ had not yet reflected this change.  Browsing the settings I noticed that the default setting was to update every three hours.  The shortest duration available is currently one hour.  Upon changing to thatit reported the same temperature as the other app.  Likely they get their data from the same or similar sources.  I believe the app should update the weather whenever it is opened.  Seems like common sense especially when you consider that this app doesn't have a home screen widget.  You only see the weather it reports when you open it.  No point to open it more often than once an hour, at this point, if you are looking for changes.<br /><br />Third, there is a criticism of having to manually enter each city.  Sure, a GPS option would be very nice.  It took me seconds to enter my hometown and just a moment to delete LA as it kept wanting to show me LA weather first.  Weather+ could use some work in this area but certainly not a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />Lastly, with regard to the size of the app, forty+ megs?  OMG, what will I ever do?  Downloaded quickly enough over my wifi connection.  My Droid X2 has gigabytes worth of space and I can move anything I need to the SD card if necessary.  The size of the app allows for beautiful background animations which add to the abundance of information presented on one screen to create a very pleasant experience.  It is also very beautiful on a tablet.  Criticizing the size of the app seems silly in this day and age.<br /><br />In conclusion, if the hourly update is a deal breaker for you then fine.  Otherwise, I think you find a very pleasant app waiting for you that is certainly worth the normal asking price.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|ColorNote is positioned just right with lots of functions but not unnecessarily complicated. I use several shopping lists: grocery, hardware, and drugstore; a list of books I want to read, as well as a birthday reminder list. It also serves well when I want to jot down a quick note. I've installed it on my Droid phone and Kindle Fire. ColorNote is able to keep the two sync'd. Wouldn't be without it.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|it would be good but I live in henryetta and I got on the add new city and it still wont let me pop it up
B005Y423ZC|4.0|But that's just it, isn't it? Adele is not about gimmicks and she will show you flaws and I do agree a few instances where she doesn't hold up her voice, but that just seems to go with the content of her materials. What a foul-mouth! LOL. I keep wondering whether the Queen is thinking twice, three-time if she should have Adele over for a recital. I love the pans to the audience, thins, fats, LOTS of women and the men who reluctantly(?) accompanied the womenfolks. Buy his DVD for the show, the personality, the chats. There is probly another version for a perfect-er performance for you technical perfectionists. Adele very genuine, I wish her for more materials in the future. Stay real.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Hi my name is molly and my mom says this game is fun and she said I should get it so I did and it is addiciting
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|For those of you rating this down because of lack of widgets, your mistaken!<br /><br />Most likely the app was automatically installed to your SD card. Since widgets in Android won't run from there you need to move the app back to your phone instead. Once you do this there are 3 widgets to choose from.<br /><br />Cheers
141690977X|5.0|This book was extremely entertaining, and educational if your a single woman.  I suggested this book to all my friends.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a nice app. for when you are in class with some extra time on your hands. great for unnecessary study time.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Like the differences from other digital Mahjong games I've played.Story line is weak and not an important part of the play. But still like it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Hint guide is a life saver for those who aren't scholars or psychic. But I still find it fun because the hints are basic so it is still kind of challenging. Beautiful game with no glitches or bugs. 10 stars if I could!
B000P6YNSE|4.0|I am a fan!  Lost does it again.  The season kind of started off slow, but it ended up on a good note.
059306612X|5.0|...make you smile, breathe deeper, open your eyes and enjoy looking at the world afresh. It contains a hundred elegant answers to use (gently) upon meeting people too frightened to question. Arm yourselves!
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This app has the potential to be one of the premier weather applications saying it does provide all info unlike most weather apps. It is however lacking widget options and the time is still on daylight savings with out the option to change it. I just made it one of the shortcut keys in my existing weather clock and will do for now but at its large file size it does need changes to put it over the top.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I read this book in about 2 days.  I found that the mystery was exciting and I could not wait to find out the solution.  The characters are a bit boring and needed some development but it didn't take away from the storyline surprisingly...I found the mystery of the maze more exciting than any of the characters do I didn't find myself really concerned whether the characters survived or not,  more looking forward to putting all the puzzle pieces together.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I played this game for days on end ... I love the mean faces the red blocks make when you are trying to knock them off too...
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is number one in my DVD collection. I watch it every day and never get tired of any of the programs. I hope this series never ends.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use this on my phone and on my Kindle Fire.  My only complaint is that with downloaded versions (such as NKJV), you can't highlite verses if you are not connected to a network.
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is straight amazing best cd I have for blasting in the car nothing's better than the killers. Best driving tunes around especially their first album hot fuss anyone thinking about buying don't hesitate it's a must have BUY!!!!! ;)
006197806X|5.0|Being in a life that Lena had to live, and reading it through Lauren's beautifully written book, couldn't of made me feel like I was actually living her life. I could feel everything Lena was feeling as she went through her trials and tribulations, and couldn't imagine being put into the position she did at the end of the book! I love this book, and the story so far. Only bad part is I have to wait a whole year for the final one lol. The anxiety I have to have to wait for the ending of this wonderful trilogy is to the max! Thank you Lauren for sharing your God given talent with this world!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Yes the website is free, but the app comes with a fantastic math keyboard that makes a world of difference. To those that complain about needing a network connection, the calculations are done (and must inherently be done) through the Wolfram Alpha server. That would be like complaining that Google search requires a network connection.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Played this on my Evo 4g and my Kindle Fire. Runs smooth and loads fast. Lots of levels, some more challenging than others, but they're all fun to figure out.
0756405890|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and didn't think the stories were too similar. I wouldn't have compared them at all if I hadn't seen a review comparing them. This is a beautiful story in it's own. It's full of heartbreak and pain, then glimmers of happiness and hope. There were so many twists and turns, I had no idea where the story was going to end up. The end stops at a good point and I am going to buy the second book today. I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this to everyone!
B0064ORVCQ|4.0|The movie itself was enjoyable and your typical HP movie.<br /><br />I love 3D, even watch a lot of 2D things in converted 3D but the 3D in this movie is bad.  So bad that I stopped it about 45 minutes in and started watching the non 3D blu-ray version.<br /><br />Buy this for the movie and not for the 3D.<br /><br />The 3D in part 2 is much better.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Bought this for my man for Valentines day and we both sat down and watched it. Best performance to date of Phantom for home viewing.  Vendor was on time, great price. Will use them again.
B006671NPM|5.0|I thought this was a well done ending and really action packed.  Some scenes are stunning and make you go wow!<br /><br />The 3D was good but not great, still way better than the 3D in part 1.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I was wrong, if you load the app in main memory, rather than SDCARD you DO get widgets.  3 of them.  But it still does not do GPS integration so you have to select your city and/or location.  The graphics are beautiful and very well done.  So, I've upped my rating from 3 to 4 as widgets DO EXIST.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is wonderful!  A nice clean movie...no swearing, no violence, no sex.  Just good clean fun.  I love the extra features as well.  I love to see the background of movies.  I highly recommend this as a good family film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I t has a lot of different games to play, all of them are fun. I t is fun for all ages. my child loves it.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I love Pride and Prejudice, and love this movie.  I would have left out a couple of small parts which are a little off the wall and embarrassing.  But otherwise, wonderful!  Special features are great as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its worth downloading its better than I thought it would be and you should get it on your Ipod or kindle fire.
B000FC1336|5.0|I thought only Vince Flynn books (Mitch Rapp) could make me hyper-ventilate.<br />Someone told me about Patrick Robinson's books, and now there are two authors that can do it.<br />Did you ever find stories so exciting, so real, so taut that you actually put the book down because you have to catch your breath, and worse, it was so very good that you didn't want finish it too fast?<br />The detail, the naval knowledge, the politics.... a treat!<br />If you like \\"Right full rudder; all ahead flank\\", you will love his books.<br /><br />Fred Auerbach
B006OCM0G0|5.0|super fun. but not for kids, if you don't expect to pay any money. its free if you read it correctly.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app works great no issues I can find I really like how it integrates with the kindle fire I would recommend this one.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|its awesome I always record music because their is a music button. where u can record it and when you record it u can listen to it later even if u don't have Internet connection I use it all the time when I am in the car because it is alreaddy recorded
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Enough to keep me occupied on long flights. Annoying the increasing amounts of points required to unlock new games. overall not bad and worth the free download
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Gould be better. I enjoyed it muchly. it is very entertaining. my favorite game so far is the sushi game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Left me immediately running for the Kindle Book Store to buy and download the next book.<br /><br />Amazing. Anyone who has read [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]] needs to read this book and then immediately start [[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]].
1451627289|2.0|I havne't read a Stephen King book in years, but the premise of this book sounded intriguing so I picked it up.  This book is so slow that it's painful to read at times.  The charactes are interesting, and where the book is at it's best is when he is focused on their personal lives.  The Lee Oswald parts are so detailed that they seem to never end.  Obviously Stephen King did a lot of research for this book, but he didn't need to include all of it!  If they ever release an abridged version with about 300 pages chopped out, then read it.  Otherwise, skip this one!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. Sad to see the trilogy end but I think she ended it with the grace it deserved, and how I hoped she would. Just as good as the other two books in the series. It is hard not to get wrapped up in the world she so vividly paints for us. An emotional rollercoaster that keeps you on your toes and makes you fall even more in love with all the characters. Epic.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who has read [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]] and [[ASIN:B003O86FMW Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].
B0054JZC6E|3.0|my kid's love playing these little games on here keeps them busy and they are being good not bad lol
B0000549B0|5.0|This is one of Jimmy Stewart's finest movies.  It ranks up there with \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" and \\"Philadelphia Story\\".  I believe that Jimmy brought out that inner child that resides in all of us.  That \\"child\\" allows themselves the right to believe in things that others find to be outrageously nutty.  You can't help but love Mr. Dowd and his friend Harvey.  Everyone should have a friend like him.  Maybe this would be a better world if we did.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|It has very pretty graphics and animations but a severe flaw; you have to manually input every location. There is a lot of work to be done before this goes above a two star.
B0018ARN6U|5.0|If you don't like this - you don't like real Rock & Roll.  Stripped down and lethal.  Monolith and Motivator are just soooo coool. Every guitar riff is incredible.  Maybe Bolan wasn't a great rock guitarist, but he sure knew how to write and dub the mix.  This is easily one of the 10 best rock albums of all time.  You need to get this and Slider and play it on your killer stereo.  Forget the rest - these are the 2 TREX albums to own.  I bought this on vinyl when it was first issued light years ago.  This remix is incredible and a MUST HAVE.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is amazing, as is Adele.  Great music - great lyrics.  If you have yet to hear her sing, start with this Album - \\"21\\".  You will definitely be a fan after listening to this particular album.  I would recommend it to people of all ages - she definitely has a universal appeal - and buying from Amazon.com is the easiest way to get anything and everything you need.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This book was our book club book for March and boy did it garner discussion!  While some felt it was a romanticized version of the disease all of us felt moved by the book, either by the theme or the characters.  Many of the women commented that Genova's writing was \\"beautiful\\" and the characters were real and well developed.  I would recommend this book without hesitation.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Very happy with the CD. Just what I had in mind. Satisfied with the shipping and packaging. Would recommend. I have always loved Whitney Houston's music.
1401233384|4.0|Yet another big event, this one centred on the Flash, who comes to in a world completely changed from what he knows and has to set it right. Glimpses of the (completely unneeded) post-reboot DC universe are seen in one of the last adventures of the pre-reboot DCU. It's a shame DC made the switch. Plus points to the book: good writing from Johns, terrific art by Kubert, and an unexpected moment of emotion from one character you'd never expect.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love being able to read the same text in several versions.  what a blessing.  it has been force closing a lot recently though.  I'm not sure why.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I play this all the time and so does my mom it is really cool.Really fun you can play against other people like on the Internet and some other stuff.
B0001I55OC|5.0|The fact that Paul Walker and Gerard Butler are going back in the past to face an evil to save not the damsal in the distress but Pauls archiologist dad, is something worth seeing. I love history of any kind, but this is more than history. It's a story of friendship, loyalty, and bravery with a little bit of romance sprinkled on top. The director of the \\"Gooonies\\" may not have made a timeless classic like Chunk and the truffle shuffle, but it is a movie worth watching again and again!<br /><br />Mike Christian III
B00511ONPG|4.0|`Likeable Social Media' is well-organized and easy to read. This book is for practitioners such as social markets, marketing directors, CMO, and etc., but it also could be useful information to anyone using social media now. It helps the understanding of using social media in the real world by numerous case studies. Eighteen strategies with case studies show organizations how to engage and interact with their customers. In my opinion, some strategies are also applicable to individual social media accounts such as the case of the Mayor in New Jersey. It is very clear and makes easy to follow these eighteen strategies. These are already a very familiar concept in the traditional marketing world, but he associated these with case studies from companies or persons and connected this concept with social media very well.<br /><br /> Most of the examples of this book covered Facebook or Youtube a little bit. He also mentioned other social media but mostly about Facebook. Nowdays, the big three players in social media are Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. Among them, Facebook is the biggest one, but if he adds more information about other social media examples as well, it would be better. Due to this, he covered other social media about how to use these social media with your business in appendix. However, it is a boring part because these mainly focus on theoretical stories, not about case studies. Plus, he started to talk about WOW factors in the end with ROI and advertisements. This is also good information and related to social media, but it needs more explanation. The information is not enough for helping how these eighteen strategies connects with ROI and advertisements.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is a great app. I predominantly use it to stream radio stations from around the world  while driving.<br /><br />When I am stuck in traffic on the highway, it gives me great pleasure to know that there is a traffic jam on the M25 counter-clockwise at Junction 22 to St Albans (LBC 1152 AM, London), or the N1 Southbound is closed at Buccleuch in Gauteng (Talk radio 702, Johannesburg). And when I get tired of local talk shows, it' good to know that there is someone in New Zealand who is just as upset about trivial issues as folks here in the US (Newstalk ZB, Auckland).<br /><br />And I don't have to listen to local music either. Why listen to local radio stations play the same rotations again and again when I can listen to trance from Argentina (95.1 Metro FM, Buenos Aires) or classical music from Germany (Klassik Radio 101.3 FM, Berlin)<br /><br />And those commercials! From St Maarten to St Petersburg, I get to hear about car dealerships and furniture stores and restaurants and so much more (on sale this weekend only, hurry in now)!<br /><br />Much more enjoyable than listening to local radio, to be sure!
B0011UF792|3.0|If you are a believer in religion you won't find this movie to be funny.<br />If you are an atheist you definitely will find it to be funny.<br />If you are an agnostic you won't be able to decide whether it's funny or not.
