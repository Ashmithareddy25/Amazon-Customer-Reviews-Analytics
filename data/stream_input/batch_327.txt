B000001DTM|5.0|&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; introduced U2 into that weird era that was the 1990's. Gone were their American blues-type rock n' roll from &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; or the politics of &quot;War&quot; and &quot;The Unforgettable Fire.&quot; &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is a European, spacey, techno-flavored masterpiece of experimentation that proved U2 could easily shed their old skins for more slick covers. Not only did it establish the weird but effective mix of techno and hard rock that is still part of their structure, it also introduced us to U2, the artsy types. They dabbled in glorious excess which is evident with Bono taking the persona of The Fly, a rock star composed of Jim Morrison's pants, Elvis'jacket and Lou Reed's shades. But the music is what makes the image work. Here we get some stuff that has aged extremely well. The album opens with &quot;Even Better Than The Real Thing,&quot; a soaring and spacey moment of energy and fun while &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; feels like ravishing Eastern music with rock polishes. &quot;Until The End Of The World&quot; is an epic, poetic journey of emotion and sonic experience. &quot;The Fly&quot; is a stylish dose of futuristic rock n'roll with some enticing lyrics (&quot;it's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky&quot;). The instrumental star of this album is The Edge with his guitar which soars, glides and slithers with different identities and textures. Bono's vocals take a more laid-back, stylish nature than in previous U2 works. There is even a moment of evocative, dark romance with &quot;Love Is Blindness,&quot; an atmospheric, haunting ballad with a roaring guitar solo. It vibrates with the feel of heartbreak. &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is a vital album not just for U2 but for the 90's decade, few albums of modern rock have reached the creativity and successful experimentation we find here. When bands try to change their identities we sometimes cringe and try to figure out what happened (which is exactly what I am doing with Metallica's new album &quot;St. Anger&quot;). U2 here proves you can experiment and still retain your spirit and good taste. &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is timeless, complex and a masterwork.
B000066F6H|5.0|Theis Retro/Punk/Pop.  That's what I'm calling it.  It's only 28 minutes long.  That's a good thing, becuase you won't be able to take more than that.  And that's in a good way.  Short, well constructed songs. LOUD. MANIC. WILD.  The songs frow into each other.  Sounds like The Romones on amphetimines.  Great disc.  Real structured chaos.  At the end you're so exhauted that you're grateful it's only 28 minutes, cause you won't be able to take anymore.  A truly emotional draining experience.  If you want an experience, then buy this.  I think it's great.
1557280290|5.0|I'd never heard of this author or this book until I read an essay about him in an old back issue of Ploughshares by the novelist Dan Wakefield. I was suspect, too, because I'm not one for academic novels, unless they're farcical, because the only thing there seems to be at stake in academic novels is tenure, which in my opinion, doesn't make for such great reading. Well, not so in Stoner. Stoner is a quiet look at a man's largely unheroic and drab life, \\"an adventureless tale\\" as Joyce wrote (and in many respects William Stoner, the protagonist, comes right out of Dubliners). The feat of this book is that Williams makes the diurnal and fairly dull activities of an academic utterly riveting. How does he do it? By not being precious or pretentious about it, which is how so many other writers would have handled the material. Instead, Williams believes in the integrity of his hero, for whom nothing is easily achieved, or for that matter, very attractive. Even Stoner's honeymoon is a fairly squalid affair, and somehow, as bad as the story gets -- and it doesn't get bad in a dramatic or gimmicky way, just bad in the sense that Stoner never really experiences any joy in his life -- we keep reading. The book is grim, yes, and yet it will leave you feeling oddly enthralled. Read it.
B00004XONN|5.0|From the opening 5 descending notes on the scale, you know you're going to listen to something really special.  The disc is a hard listen.  It's very stark, moody.  You have to listen alot to get into it.  This isn't pop, this is art.  The disc ushers in a new era.  This is the statement of the new millenium.  The abscence of guitars is beautiful and fascinating.  Putting a rock album forth without this instrument.  Unheard of.  There are 4 hits on here, and the rest are soundscapes.  Listen carefully and each listen will reveal more.  This a 15 star disc.  Nothing has been created ever like this.  A must have.  You have to buy it.
B00009P1MP|5.0|In 1971 the world was changed somewhat by an 8 minute plus song that became an anthem for a generation. American Pie the longest single in history went on to become the most disected - there are web sites dedicated to it's interpretation . American Pie is clearly the best Album never to have won a Grammy - though it was nominated for 4 - apart from the title tracks it is filled with classic songs like Vincent (Starry Starry Night)Winterwood , Empty Chairs and Babylon. This set is remastered and includes 2 songs from the original sessions that were left off the original Album . The packaging is unique in that it is designed to replicate the original album - fold out cardboard style with sleeve inserts - well done Capitol Records.Liner notes are excellent and McLean also writes about each song. This is a must have classic that should be in every collection.
B00006YXE4|5.0|Without a doubt, Eric Clapton is one of the world's greatest and respected guitarists as well as being an extraordinary vocalist. With his latest live release, \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\", Clapton and his band of well-known accomplished musicians take the listener on a wonderful journey through his amazing 40 year career.<br />Besides his solo classics such as \\"Cocaine\\" \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", Eric goes back even further with outstanding renditions of the Cream classics \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\" and \\"Badge\\" as well as a remarkable nine-minute take on the Clapton standard \\"Layla\\" from Derek and The Dominos.<br />Of course, no Clapton set would be complete without a little bit of blues. Here, Eric tackles a solo acoustic rendition of \\"Keys To The Highway\\" and later on when fully plugged-in, he tears into smoking takes of \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" and \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman?\\" showcasing some brilliant and flawless lead guitar and gritty vocals.<br />To make this live set complete, Clapton also performs some of his most recent hits including the Grammy award winning \\"Tears In Heaven\\" as well as \\"Change The World\\" and \\"River Of Tears\\".<br />A slight departure from the norm is the beautiful instrumental title track to Clapton's \\"Reptile\\" album and his cheerful uplifting version of the standard \\"Over The Rainbow\\" from the 1939 classic film \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".<br />Overall, this is the most solid live album ever to be released by Eric Clapton during his long career. It seems as if many of today's aging musicians get better as they get older. Eric Clapton is no exception. In my opinion, he sounds better now at 57 than he did at 27 or 37.<br />This live CD set also comes with a DVD which includes all of the music heard on the CDs plus a great performance of Billy Preston's \\"Will It Go Round In Circles?\\" in which Mr. Preston himself steps up to the microphone and gets the crowd going. He also displays some fancy footwork as well.<br />What else can I say? \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\" shows that Eric Clapton has definitely not run out of gasoline. He and his wonderful band of seasoned pros (Nathan East, Andy Fairweather-Low, Steve Gadd, David Sancious, Billy Preston and Greg Phillinganes-who appears on the CDs but not the DVD) display an acceptional talent. This is one that you'll definitely not want to miss. Great performance. Great musicianship. Great songs.Car, One More Rider\\" shows that Eric Clapton has definitely not run out of gasoline.

B00005V9IK|5.0|Independence Day is the quintessential summer blockbuster movie.  I really cannot understand why the movie is rated three stars or less by so many reviewers.  Not only do I love this movie, I love it just as much every time I watch it.  It never fails to take full emotional control of me, bringing tears of sadness and later happiness to my eyes as well as giving me goose pimples in its most patriotic and triumphant of moments.  We see into the hearts and souls of an impressive number of very realistic characters, and I for one feel myself as one with all of the brave survivors of the initial alien onslaught, watching, hoping, and praying that America and the world can come together and defeat yet another seemingly unbeatable enemy.  I sometimes enjoy pulling for the bad guys in films, but the aliens that arrive suddenly on earth with a plan of exterminating every human being on the planet are pure evil, guaranteeing that the feelings of one and all movie viewers will rest completely with the forces of good.<br />The storyline is familiar by now.  Aliens arrive in huge black ships, coming to a stop over the major cities of the world, refusing any attempt to communicate with the people of earth.  David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), a cable company employee and M.I.T. graduate who lost his first wife partly to his own lack of ambition, figures out the secret code the alien ships are using to communicate with one another around the globe.  Even with his ex-wife working as the President's assistant, it is all he can do to warn the leader of the free world that the aliens are counting down to attack and \\"the clock is ticking.\\"  Millions of people are wiped off the face of the earth by the force of the alien offensive, and the military all but falls apart as it tries and fails to inflict any damage on the enemy.  In the end, the survival of humanity itself comes down to the brave acts of America's real heroes - good old regular, every day, anonymous Americans.  The quintessential representative of these heroes is Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), Vietnam veteran turned inebriated crop duster whom no one took seriously when he claimed to have been abducted by aliens a decade earlier.  President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) also stands head and shoulders among the crowd of heroes, as does Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and Levinson himself.<br />Independence Day is blessed with both amazing special effects and a wonderful cast.  I'm no big fan of Jeff Goldblum or Bill Pullman, but they are both superb in this film.  Will Smith is both inspiring and hilarious as Capt. Hiller; the fit he throws after bagging himself a downed spaceship early on looks and sounds like the kind of thing I would say and do (up to a point).  His interplay with Levinson toward the end of the film offers some truly high caliber comedy, just the thing needed to try and hold one's blood pressure down as the final battle for earth itself is being waged.  Brent Spiner from Star Trek: TNG makes a memorable appearance, and familiar faces such as Robert Loggia and Judd Hirsch add much to the film in roles that are comparatively small for such major players in the business.  The special effects are simply tremendous, boasting some especially well-done, powerful shots.  The sight of the White House being destroyed in the blink of an eye by alien firepower is now a staple of pop culture, and it is just one of a huge number of similarly impressive explosions to be seen here.  The manner in which the film opens is quite eerily effective, and the director obviously went to great and rewarding pains to try and show just how huge these ships are compared to earth's structures and inhabitants.  What I was most impressed with were the scenes depicting infernos rushing and roiling down the streets toward trapped, innocent, doomed men, women, and children; we watch as cars come hurtling toward our viewpoint, and I will never forget the image of a huge fire engine being blown right at me as ifit were a dandelion seed in the wind.<br />This really is the most exhilarating movie I own.  President Whitmore's speech to all the brave men and women around him, including a large number of volunteer heroes who have never even thought about flying an F-16 loaded to the hilt with missiles before, truly gives me chills of patriotism every time I hear it; his is a statement that sums up what it means to be both an American and a citizen of the world.  I just cannot say enough good things about Independence Day; in my opinion, it is one of the most impressive, soul-stirring films I have ever seen.it were a dandelion seed in the wind.<br />This really is the most exhilarating movie I own.

B000002B2T|3.0|Layne Stayley's voice is unmistakable. And just because he is partners here with guitarist Mike McCready(Pearl Jam) and Mark Lanegan(Screaming Trees) doesn't change that a bit. Songs here recall dark minimalist 70's rock, especially the beautiful &quot;River Of Deceit&quot; and the Stayley diary of &quot;Long Gone Day.&quot; McCready shows his love for Zeppelin in the single string riffs of &quot;Lifeless Dead&quot; and the swirling &quot;I'm Above,&quot;(where Lanegan helps out on vocals.) The bong hit moodiness of this record is mesmerizing, but often sounds like a sleepy jam session, which was probably the whole idea of the record to begin with. On a sad note, Stayley and bassist Baker Saunders both later died from heroin overdoses.
B00005JM09|3.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator role is unquestionably the role that put him on the map, and this third installment has been a long time coming (12 years after part 2). Is it as good as the pervious 2 movies? Right off the bat, I will say no. While most action fans will love the overlong chase sequences and fights, diehard fans of the original will see this as a letdown.<br />Apparently, the end of the second movie was wrong. Judgement Day was not stopped, it was merely postponed. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is once again confronted with the future when a female terminator (a very sexy female terminator) is sent back to kill him, since he is to become the future resistance leader, and his future lieutenant, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). The new female terminator, the T-X, is stronger, faster, and miles more advanced than the T-1000 from Terminator 2. True to form, Arnie returns as the original T-100 terminator (a different model, though)  to protect these two, who are important to the survival of the human race.<br />While the ideas put forth on paper are good, they seem insubstantial in the execution. The first two movies balanced action with a solid storyline, while the third seems like a by-the-numbers action movie with a story added in for effect. It  doesn't have the same look, feel, or emotional impact of the first two movies. Arnold is heavy on the one-liners here, but his performance lacks any substance, and comes across as wooden and annoyingly heavy on the self-parody.<br />Terminator 3 is not a bad movie, in fact there were many elements that I quite liked. But as a Terminator movie, it fails, if for no other reason is because it had a lot to live up to after Terminator 2. The secret to appreciating Terminator 3 is to lower your expectations, and no go into it thinking of the previous movies.
B00005NWM3|4.0|A lot of people like to bash bands like Nickelback, blaming them for overdone paperweight rock. Thing is, they don't claim to be anything other than a normal hard rock outfit. The opening AC/DC bass lines of &quot;Never Again&quot; show the group's foundation. The ballads &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and &quot;Too Bad&quot; show singer/guitarist Chad Kroeger able to be sensitive and have meaty guitar parts at the same time. The disc really picks up near the end with the heavy riffing of &quot;Where Do I Hide&quot; and &quot;Hangnail,&quot; making not bobbing your head up and down nearly impossible. They could maybe be heavier here and there, but these are some of the best rock songs in the business right now, like it or not.
B000099T2L|4.0|I am extemely proud of Beyonce's album. All of her lyrics are on point and they hit so close to home, it's scary. The best song on the album??? DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE, of course!! Her duet with Luther (The Closer I Get To You), is beautiful! When you get two voices like that to come together... it's MAGIC! The most touching song on the album is DADDY (the hidden track). Nice beat, wonderful lyrics... The girl can WRITE. My other favorites are YES, THAT'S HOW YOU LIKE IT, GIFT FROM VIRGO, SIGNS... The whole album is wonderful. Unfortunately, some of the songs I don't care for, but hey... that doesn't mean she didn't put her all into it. BUY THE ALBUM! I promise you that you will find a favorite or even an anthem! This is for all the people who have been pressured into having sex early (Yes), being in love (Dangerously In Love, Gift From Virgo), being dumped and feeling guilty (Me, Myself and I), you're about to go out and paint the town red (Naughty Girl & Hip Hop Star), sprung off your man (Baby Boy), if you're in \\"the mood\\" (Be With You & Speechless)  if you're in a \\"whatever\\" type of mood (Signs & That's How You Like It)... or just in the mood for some old school (The Closer I Get To You)... BUY IT! I personally guarantee you won't be disappointed! Beyonce' Jazzel Knowles... you have proven yourself worthy, and I love you for it! GO GET IT!!
B000000W6F|5.0|Gish was actually the last Pumpkins studio album I purchased. After becoming addicted to Siamese Dream. Of all the other Pumpkins albums (not including Picies Iscariot) Gish has the most in common with Siamese Dream, the faint sabbath/zepplin guiatars and the pyscadelic scales. <br />That aside they are two very different albums. Where Siamese Dream riffs and rages under the sun, Gish relaxes in the cool shade. Witness the weed soaked Rhinocerous and its mellow build up using the psycadelic guitars. Corgan don't quite have the anger he will acquire for his next few albums. Only on Shiva is there a glimpse of the rage that will come. The rawer sound to the is album gives it an earthy feel.<br />The beauty of this album is its innocence, its young and bored, but it a happy stoned kind of way. There is little evidence of \\"grunge\\" influencing this album. Its not depressing or angry or even punkish. What Gish really does is to show that Nirvana and the seattle bands were not alone, other kids across the world, sick of the hair metal bands were developing their own music. <br />Dreamy and hazy, almost neo-hippy ethos, Gish is the perfect start to the Pumpkins career. They would equall this album with Siamese Dream, but they would never top it again.
0345440900|5.0|Like any parenting book, you take what you want to out of it and throw out the rest or leave it in the back of your head as a possibility. This book saved my life as far as understanding my daughter's cries and what they meant. I realized I was doing a lot of the things that were actually compounding the problem in efforts to try to help her (like overstimulation). I think this is a must-read for every parent -- new and even if you have other kids but are having another baby.
B000066HI4|5.0|One of the spookiest, most personal albums I've ever heard.
B000021XS0|1.0|I wanted to like Dream Theater, I really did.  I'm a big Queensryche fan and my friend urged me to get this CD since if I liked Queensryche, I'd like Dream Theater.  Wrong!  The musicianship is excellent technically, but the songwriting is weak.  If I wanted to listen to 15-minute instrumentals, I'd drag out one of my old Rush or Led Zep albums.  Since buying this I've seen DT live three times (once by themselves and twice because they were playing with Queensryche) and again, they're great musically, James Labrie is an excellent vocalist, but I was bored stiff during all the long instrumental breaks.  Even Labrie leaves the stage!  If I could tell DT anything, I'd say shorter songs, more singing by James, and less guitar/keyboard noodling.  I've never seen, or heard, such a technically excellent band that was so boring.
B00008LDPU|2.0|I was very disapointed with this film.  I was looking forward to this DVD more then I was looking forward to Reloaded.  But it did not live up to my expectations.
B00000I0ZG|5.0|AMAZING QUALITY SOUND, MUSIC FROM HEAVEN, ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF SARAH  BRIGHTMAN, AMAZING.. YOU SHOULD LISTEN... I AM IN LOVE OF THIS CD..<br />5 STARS
B00008YLV2|5.0|I refused to buy the first edtiion of BLACKHAWK DOWN and I am glad I waited. This 3 disk set is loaded with extras inclusing two documentaries on the actual event, production notes and other extras.<br />This is not a proud moment for the political leadership in this country, but it is an exception moment for the Rangers and Delta force soldiers. The action in Mogadishu was the largest firefight since Vietnam. Ridley Scott's movie captures the essense, the valor and heroism of what took place. It also makes the point that Task force Ranger was not permitted to finish the job. Perhaps, if they had, history might have been different.<br />This is a must have edition to your collection of military and war movies.
B00006LI4S|5.0|What can I say? WOW! This is a great GREAT DVD.<br />Image is perfect, sound is amazing completely, and the performance is just the finest.<br />During this long Pink Floyd absence (and probably definitive) since p.u.l.s.e, it is always refreshing to find new and different versions of classic oldies. And Dave does it in a triumphant way...<br />An almost entirely acoustic set (without all the MTV fancy media around) serves beautifully to Gilmour's purposes of setting Floyd's related songs to what will possibly become a classic.<br />Acoustic keyboards, bass, drums, guitars (with some effects, though) and voices, replace the always electronic Pink Floyd environment with elegant success.<br />I was specially thrilled by the choir: they substitute Rick Wright's keyboards on many songs, giving them a totally fresh and new aura. Let's wait to hear the sample of High Hopes that Dave presents (\\"you'll hear what I get to hear during rehearsals\\").<br />I can say is that this version of High Hopes is even better than the original one.<br />A must for all PF fans. Buy it.
B000002LCX|5.0|Yes, this is the best Smith's album to me. I think its the most emotional piece of work they released. Knowing what was riding on this album, and knowing what was going on while they made this album makes it much more clearer this is thier best album. Not a bad track on this. Sorry, if I don't put God Save The Queen, above this. Sad that this album is underrated, overlooked and misunderstood....
B00005JLZN|4.0|I had read so many reviews saying how bad this movie was, so since I don't go by what other people think I saw it. I have to tell you that I loved it, it is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.<BR>  I think that people taht disliked the movie where people that got offended by it. There are some issues that may be sensitive to a number of people. I on the other hand didn't get offended at all. I'm not going to describe the story because I'm sure everyone knows waht it is about. All i have to say is that i highly recommned this movie to anyone with an open mind.<br />Legend: 5 Stars: Classic; 4 Stars: Excellent; 3 Stars: Good; 2 Stars: Fair; 1 Star: Poor
B00005ASHM|5.0|I bought this album in 1999 because I saw it and I remembered hearing how it was one of the greatest albums of all time. Well at first I felt really bad for the buy. I could only get into a few songs, so I shelved it. One day I decided I would give it another go and it was a totally different feeling than I remembered. It grew on me so much now that I have to listen to it at least once a week if not more. It's a strange album coming from the Beach Boys cause you can definately feel the pain and depression Brian Wilson was going through. It's a real gem and it takes a few listens to understand but I personally don't feel it has a bad song on it. Another great thing about this album is it tells a beautiful story if you listen closely. In conclusion to this review, everyone should give it a full listen and sometime because the best albums are the ones that grow on you and this ones still growing.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan, and I am sad to see the Star Trek series come to an end. But this film provides a satisfing end to the series. It wraps up the story very well and gives you something to think about. This is a DVD the entire family will be able to enjoy. Nemesis is just as good as the other movies and can be enjoyed just as much. There are great actions scenes and the movie was very well filmed.
B0000035E7|5.0|Nirvana's first album, Bleach, is a testament to a raw, extreme side of the group. The songs, while not all hits like the many from Nevermind, are just as amazing, if not more. The cd was created for $600, and you can tell, but it adds to the greatness of the cd. You can also tell the drummer is not the amazing Dave Grohl, but Chad Channing gives a good effort. All in all this cd is what every true Nirvan fan needs. It is the kind of music Nirvana wanted to make. It is perfect in every way!!
0385504209|2.0|Book Quote: &quot;The New Testament is false testimony&quot;. If you are even a casual Christian - the premise of this book will offend you. (The following provides some insight but does not give away the ending.) The world created by Dan Brown requires you to believe that Christ had children with Mary Magdalene, and that his rising was fabricated by the Catholic church in its effort to subjugate the world. Ugh! Ron Brown depicts Christians, and the Church was the bad guys, and the goddess worshiping, new age spiritualist as the protagonists. The main character, Langdon, is a cardboard cutout, Indiana Jones wanta-be, who couldn't even carry Indiana's fedora.
B0000062GE|5.0|Most People compare SW to NIN, and the likes.  Fact is, they are nothing alike, music is music but what sets SW apart from the rest is the meaning behind the lyrics!  Chris and the rest of SW take you through a journey of relationships, life, love, and hate.  Most say that towards the end of the CD with tracks like Drowning, and Desperate now, Goodbye and When I'm Dead, Its to dark and gloomy.  That is WHAT THE BAND WANTS YOU TO FEEL!!!  They brought you up to that point with the songs You complete me and Save Yourself only to be brought down just like in a REAL relationship thinking of all the torment and feelings of pain and dispair, then the ANGER comes, When I'm Dead and The Thing I Hate, exactly what happens after the torment, then the reflection of how it all was during the journey with the perfect ending to a great CD with Waking Up Beside You and ON Your Way Down.  Think of this CD as a relationship and what you go through after the breakup and the journey towards feeling whole again and stop looking at the CD as just Music and you will see why this CD is the Best Industrial Music Compilation of ALL Time. The order of the songs puts you in the mood then tears it all up then sooths it all over again.  BRILLIANT!!!!
B000094A6A|5.0|Its been a long time since I've laughed so much during a comedy.  The first 1/2 hour was non stop laughter and the laughs continues until the end.  I'm a girl, so its not just a &quot;guy&quot; movie.  You'll recognize alot of actors, and I think that makes this movie great, the combination of all of their talent make it hilarious.  A must see, Will Farrell is great.  I'm going to buy the DVD.
0345440900|2.0|I opened this book expecting to get helpful advice and an enjoyable read, but I was disappointed.  <br />There were plentiful examples of Tracy Hogg rescuing parents who are portrayed as fools.  This narrative approach quickly feels self-serving, condescending and inaccurate.  That impression is reinforced by the author's frequent use of English colloquial diminutives such as \\"luv\\" in addressing the reader.  I might not have minded if her advice had been practical and helpful but it consisted of (1) acronyms for the obvious such as \\"EASY\\" for \\"eat, activity, sleep and you time\\"; and (2) unnecessarily austere how-to tips.  <br />Nonetheless I completed the book and reluctantly set aside the advice in it as it turned out to be unhelpful.  My contacts from LA tell me Tracy Hogg charges her clients five figures for two weeks work, so perhaps the celebrity recommendations in her book are a result of people having paid outrageous money and not wanting to believe it was a bad decision.<br />Please buy the book by the American Perdiatric Association because it is a thorough reference for baby care, and if you have a colic problem I recommend Dr. Karp's book, \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" for a loving and effective approach.
0790729628|5.0|Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\" is an ominous,and dark look at the future. The film takes place in a very dark Los Angeles. The main character of the story is Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is ordered to kill replicants. Rather than explaining the story I am simply going to suggest that this is a movie that must be seen. However, what I intend on reviewing or comparing is the Director's Cut against the theatrical release. The Directors Cut is obviously the better choice. The original voice over narration is horrible, meaningless, and offers a fake happy ending. Harrison Ford himself admits to doing the voice over poorly hoping that the studio would not use it. The Directors Cut version is a much better film, not just because of this, but because of the ending. The film is a difficult one which takes a few viewings to fully comprehend the whole story and the ideas but it is such a brilliant film that any movie fan must dedicate themselves to Scotts masterpiece.
0399226907|4.0|Love this book and recommend it for its gorgeous illutrations and enjoyable story.<br />Eric Carle has written many books with the \\"very  _____[insert animal here]\\" formula for their titles.  I am waiting for \\"The Very Neurotic Chicken\\" and \\"The Very Nauseated Hamster\\".  But seriously, his books are classics.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of our time. He is amazing. If you were to buy buy one of his cd's buy the marshal mathers lp it is inspiring and i would recommend to anyone who is not gay, old or your parents.
B000066NW0|1.0|How funny! Every few years millions of young girls across America gather around and pick their new idol. In 1987 it was Tiffany, and moms had to suffer their little daughters wearing faded denim jackets and bright blue jeans with heart symbol patches. In 1998 it was Britney and we all had to suffer through young girls wearing miniskirts and ponytails pretending as if they'd just run away from a Catholic high school and were therefore 'bad' (in a showbiz sense).<br />Now its 2003 and more little girls with no brains have adopted the hideous Avril Lavigne as their poster girl. Avril cannot sing (every track on her CD has been remastered through a vocoder and effector). Avril cannot dance (every concert footage bit shows her standing in front of a mike and not moving). Avril cannot play an instrument (she only holds a guitar; her backup band plays the actual instrument). Avril cannot compose a song (shes admitted this herself, and every track on her CD was written by someone else). Avril cannot look pretty (why else do you think shes growing her hair so long? To cover the sides of her face!).<br />Then why is Avril famous? Easy! Because people can be stupid! The well oiled marketing machine that is the music industry proves once again that a no-talent tart can be a superstar. In an age where Pink, Justin Guarini (who?) and Eminem are considered role models, Avril seems to fit the puzzle perfectly. Every thirteen year old airhead possibly owns her CD! Welcome to the real world, people. And boy does it suck.
B00009V7T2|4.0|I don't know what exactly happened to me when I first listened to de-loused... All I can recall is an eclectic mesh of images generally ranging from overwhelming to stunning... With my lips wet from the tears of pure bliss I kiss the hands of angels who delivered this jewel onto the earth and I plea for mercy... I want to become a Martian!!<BR> The outburst of talent here is incredible... After a month of repeated listening though I have to add - a little over the top. They managed to bring out every ounce of potential worth completing at least ten standard records onto a single one, which on one hand is admirable, but on the other I feel a little restraint would do no harm at all. I come to think of the last at the drive-in CD more often now and I realize that speaking of maturity it is definitely further then de-loused.<BR> Nevertheless - a most promising debut of the soon-to-become rulers of the rock world :-)
B00005JM09|3.0|Upon discovering that both James Cameron and Linda Hamilton wanted nothing to do with a third installment of the Terminator series I am uncertain if T3 will be worth viewing. Linda rejecting doing T3 stating the script lacked the soul and same messages that the previous movies conveyed. <br />So why was this movie made? The fans demanded it be made. Ever after James and Linda rejected it it was handballed to another director and made upon the demand of the fans. <br />Arnold was finally convinced to do T3 after almost a decade of turning down offers as he puts it becuase the fans kept demanding it be made.<br />So the negatives of T3:<br />No Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor<BR>No James Cameron as director (Terminator is his creation)<BR>No Edward Furlong as John Connor (he was suffering from drug problems at the time the movie was made)<BR>A female terminator ( I saw a preview of T3 on Entertainment Tonight and the female terminator has to much personality and attitude, Terminators are supposed to be souless, emotionless machines).<br />seem to outweigh the only positive Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T101 Terminator.<br />I will most likely give T3 a viewing just to confirm if what I think is correct or hopefully to be proven wrong.<br />I hope I am proven wrong when I see it.
0684800713|3.0|I have to say I was shocked at the gratuitous homophobia, anti-Semitism and racism that Hemingway trots out from the first page on ....OK, so it was written in 1926...still! And the ridiculousness about Jake's war injury making him incapable of making love...puh-lease! Did he lose his fingers and tongue along with his nether parts? I didn't get that impression. I thought the very crux of the book was his relationship w/the proprietor of the hotel where Jake, his pals and the bullfighters stayed. Jake first of all concurs w/Montoya that the pure young bullfighter, Romero, shouldn't be exposed to the decadence of the British officials who invited him to a soiree...Jake and Montoya agreed that the invitation should simply not be communicated to the bullfighter.  Shortly thereafter, Jake colludes in Brett's seduction/corruption of that same 19 year old local hero.  After the bullfighter ends up beaten to a bloody faced pulp, Montoya shuns Jake, obviously blaming him for his part in the whole fiasco. Jake, retreats to France where he waxes on about how good it is to be in a place where people are your friends if you over-tip them; so much simpler and easier to deal with than being in a place (Spain) where the friendships are more mysterious-- alluding, though in not so many words, to his previously valued relationship with Montoya who shared his love and understanding of all the nuances of bulls and bull fighting. I take it as an indication of Jake's cynicism that he doesn't even apologize to Montoya for \\"spoiling\\" the bullfighter...just blows off what had been a special camaraderie.
0671027387|4.0|Unlike many other novels that require initial warm up chapters, Deception Point grabs readers' heart from page one and immediately sets the tone for fast pace and intense reading. 133 chapters that take you every different direction makes the plot and the ending impossible to predict until chapter 132. This novel contains several deception points, as far as I'm concerned, that I'm curious to find out which point of deception the author meant when he gave this title. It is fascinating the way the author deceives the characters and the readers.
B00009V7RF|5.0|In response to Habib's comment -- these guys rock, okay!!! We've got enough bullcrap in our skewed media that is way to propogandistic and dishonest; and that includes the misrepresentation of world affairs and the U.S.'s involvement in it!!! I agree 110% with everything the guys were saying in thier song (\\"Where is the Love\\"). As I was hearing it, I was overjoyed to know that there are people in the business who come out and actaully tell it like it is!! And as for how the song sounds... I think it's wonderful. It's melody is what caught my attention in the first place. Justin's voice complements the tune nicely. Rock on, Black Eyed Peas!! We need more singers who've got profound stuff to sing about in their songs. :)
0345448898|4.0|The first book immediatly hooked me and I loved it. The plot, the creatures, the new world, the characters.....Everything. The story kept you turning the page after page. I then went on and read the second book. I didn't like it as much as the first, but I still enjoyed it and eagerly went on to the third. I started it and never finished. I geuss that was lazy of me, but it never really got me hooked. It just had way too many sub plots that kept on switching after every page and you had trouble keeping up with it all. Also, the story drifted away from Lyra on to Will, and placed Lyra as a character on the side. And that kind of annoyed me. Maybe, since it has been a while, I would enjoy it all if I read them over again. But I would definiatly recommend you at least read the first book(which I LOVED) and then see for yourself.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Just a few days ago, a close friend who asks me about certain music and who he'd like if he wanted something a little camp, a bit boisterous, often sensitive and touching, with soaring vocals and powerful guitar riffs and solos the size of the Empire State building. A hard task to name just one band you'd think, but only one elegant word sprung to my mind. Queen.<br />My small-minded friend also with one word, stupidly came back to me and said, to my utter disbelief, 'Who?'...The guy is 19, and he claims to have never heard a song by Queen. So still in disbelief I noted to him, that children from 3 years old have heard a Queen song, and it's true they have, and they stick with the people who hear them. So he came back with 3 words: 'What to buy?' And I uttered just 3 words back: 'The Platinum Collection'.<br />There is no finer greatest hits selections on the market, and from one of the greatest, if not the greatest rock band of all time. There's an astounding 51 tracks on here, and the vast majority are complete gems.<br />Greatest Hits 1, a personal favourite of mine, is full from one side of the CD to the other with pure majesty, power, joy and ultimately the finest rock music of the 1970's and early 1980's. Of course, it has to kick off the with the grandiose, 'Bohemian Rhapsody', with its sublime mixture of operatics and straight out heavy metal, you can see why it's been voted so many times as the greatest song ever written. We have playful rock, with joyous and smile inducing piano (Dont Stop Me Now', the fantastic 'Somebody To Love', the utter camp of, 'Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy' etc.), we have straight out rock with Queen's own twisted mind (Killer Queen', 'Fat Bottomed Girls', 'Bicycle Race', 'You're My Best Friend' etc.), we have some of the greatest anthems ever written, (We Will Rock You', 'We Are The Champions' etc.) and even a little bit of thoughtful, emotion (the under-rated, 'Save Me'). Queen throughout the 70's were one of the mostcreative, powerful and downright creative, and quite literally outrageous bands out there, and to some extent, this one disc proves it. Further research can be found in the like of, 'A Day At The Races' and of course, 'A Night At The Opera'.<BR> <BR>The second greatest hits compilation, is a lot more pop orientated, a lot simpler, switching from prog rock glam, to popular hard rock with synths. We have catchy pop tunes, in Queen's own 80's style ('A Kind Of Magic', 'I Want To Break Free', 'The Miracle', 'I'm Going Slightly Mad', 'The Invisible Man' etc.), we have pure rock (The riveting, 'I Want It All', the chugging, 'Breakthru', 'Headlong', the ground shaking, 'Hammer To Fall' etc.) we have a little bit of the prog rock that made Queen famous slightly updated (The quite sublime, 'Innuendo') and a sombre pause for thought amongst the overwhelming powerhouse of sound (the beautiful, 'Who Want To Live Forever'). Queen were voted the best band of the eighties by many British polls, and with a second disc such as this you can see just why. Don't leave home without it.<br />Ah...now.... Greatest Hits 3...is not. Greatest Hits 3, was seen by many as a final attempt to get money out of the Queen faithful and yet another chance for new fans to buy their entire collection, and going on the offerings available you can see why. As good as some of the songs are on here, they were just not hits nor should they be on any hits collection. For example, Elton John's live take on the fantastic, 'The Show Must Go On' is abysmal. As much as Elton has written some fine songs in his time, his voice just can't take anything that Freddie Mercury ever put his sweet tones to, and Elton turns into the roughest cat howling in the street. The remix of 'Under Pressure' is ok, but it's yet another thought of 'Why is it here?', as does the atrocious Wyclef Jean remixed AND RAPPED version of 'Another One Bites The Dust'. Not only does this say, 'How can you call this a greatest hits collection?' it also makes you say, 'Why couldn't they have released a rarities CD or something?'. But this is an album that's half good, and half bad. The half good is very good. We have some solo work by Freddie ('Barcelona', the fitting, 'The Great Pretender', and the clubby, 'Living On My Own'), one from Brian May (the Ford soundtrack of the early 90's, 'Driven By You'), and we have a few Queen classics that obviously just wouldn't go on GH2 (the rocking, 'Prince Of The Universe' and the touching, thought provoking and ultimately fitting, 'These Are The Days Of Our Lives'), and there are some real gems that they've pulled from the 'Made In Heaven' album too (Too Much Love Will Kill You', 'You Don't Fool Me', the majestic, 'Let Me Live', the most powerful Queen song in years, 'Heaven For Everyone' etc.), which unfortunately lacks the albums title track, which was one of the best songs on the album. This also includes Brian, and Roger Taylor's tribute to all those who have died young, such as Princess Diana, and of course, Freddie himself, 'No-one But You'. A curious end also, in the Christmas song, 'Thank God It's Christmas', which could have been placed much better, which would the have left the final two tracks ('These Are The Days...' and 'No-one...') as the final chapter in the Queen book. So it's half good and half bad, and the majority of the half good is from the stunning, 'Made In Heaven', so you figure out what you should do if you want just those songs...<br />But this is a complete package of a band who've seen it all and done it all, and maybe gone that little bit further, along the way. Through the nervous beginnings, to the confidence of the mid 70's pure pomp, to the 80's pure pop, to the final chapter of the sombre 90's, and with there being so much angst in rock music around right now, why not treat yourself to an antidote to such things? Queen's the key. My small-minded friend is finding that out. I asked him what he thought of 'Platinum...' and he answered me with just 4 words: 'I think it's brilliant', to which I replied likewise with my own 4 words:<br />'I knew you would'<br />5 Stars.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|The classic debut album by VAN HALEN still sounds fresh today as it did 25 years ago. Having been a fan of the band for over 20 years, when I hear the classic VH albums, I wish they would make music like this again. This album has classic tunes all over the place. From the opening heavy intro of RUNNIN WITH THE DEVIL, to the wailing guitar intro on JAMIE'S CRYIN, note-for-note, song-for-song, this album stands the test of time. ERUPTION showcases the tremendous guitar playing of Eddie Van Halen, while throughout the album, the rhythm section of Alex Van Halen and Micheal Anthony keeping the music going the way it should. David Lee Roth and his vocals on this album help round out the music. Other songs I recommend that you listen to are : YOU REALLY GOT ME, AINT TALKIN BOUT LOVE, IM THE ONE, FEEL YOUR LOVE TONIGHT,and LITTLE DREAMER.  This album is a must have for any person who considers themselves a hard rock music fan.
B00007BH5C|4.0|Does anyone know the composer, and the name of the song when the Ents are marching toward Isengard?
B000002UAR|5.0|The first time I heard this album (US version) it blew me away. When they added the songs that were on the UK version to make the CD, this album leapt to my personal number two of all time, by any artist (behind only *Abbey Road*).  It's still there.<br />The maturation of the music of the Beatles was hinted at on *Rubber Soul*, but it came to its fruition on *Revolver*.  First, there are more great songs on this LP than other groups have on a double disc *Greatest Hits* collection.  Second, there is al sorts of style from sunshine pop (Good Day Sunshine, Yellow Submarine), thought proving commentary on life (Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, Doctor Robert), world influnced western music (Love to You, Tomorrow Never Knows) and a little bit of everyting else.
0684857820|4.0|This is a well written book that brings the reader along and allows them to feel like they are living out the story.  That being said, it was a really hard read for me.  <br />I am a rape survivor, and this book brought out a lot of feelings that I thought I had left behind me (with the help of plenty of counseling!).  My situation was completely different from Ms. Sebold's, but it seems that many of the feelings associated with rape are universal.  I felt revictimized for a few days after reading the book.  Also, I had to take many breaks while reading because panic attacks would come on during some of the more intense moments.<br />This was a great book, and I don't want to discourage anyone from reading it.  However, I think that it is important for other survivors to know what they are getting into.
0385504209|3.0|There are already 500+ reviews of this book, which means that it has struck a resonant chord with a lot of readers.<br />I read through this book very quickly and enjoyed it as a summer suspense thriller.  I enjoyed Brown's ability to bring a lot of interesting facts and fun conjectures together, and can forgive the possibly many errors, omissions and suppositions that others have found.  It is &quot;just a novel&quot; after all.<br />It was only after I was done, however, and started to think about the various elements of the book that it struck me:  while I was reading the book, it felt like fiction imbued with historical scholarship.  Now that I think through the various plot devices and elements, that feeling is transmogrified into thinking this is cotton candy scholarship -- delicious, but ultimately just a bit airy and unsubstantial.<br />I don't like throwing rocks.  I think Brown has done a great job with this.  I'm just surprised at the large numbers of people who have embraced this book as a scholarly look at the world.
B00006LLNU|5.0|By all logic, this album should be the most pretentious of 2002.  The album has no title, nor do the songs.  The songs are all in a made-up gibberish language created by Jonsi, the lead singer.  Not only that, most of the songs contain the same \\"words\\", sung differently in each, though.  There are no liner notes; only a sticker on the back with the little copyright information required by law.  This sounds like an artsy-fartsy album by a pretentious art rock band.  Why did I give it five stars, then? Simply because Sigur Ros is that darn good.  They promised in their last album that this would be better, and it is, exponentially so.  The band has claimed that they will change the face of modern music, and they certainly seem on a path to do just that.  Sigur Ros is the Muhammad Ali of modern music - they talk a lot of s**t, and do a lot of things that should seem annoyingly pompous by most standards, but they're good enough to back it all up.  It's like the man said, \\"if you can back it up, it ain't bragging.\\"<br />This album is simply amazing.  Its expansive yet simplistic soundscapes will bring you to tears.  You'd be hard pressed to find anything that matches their intensity and beauty.  These guys could just be the greatest living band in the world, and they're only getting better.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Does this movie live up to the standard set by \\"Fellowship of the Ring?\\"  Answer: Yes and no.<br />YES, IT DOES because it was made with the same precision, quality, and attention to detail as its predecessor.  As was done with \\"Fellowship,\\" Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's Middle Earth to life with unprecedented realism.  The CGI is, if anything, even more fluid and transparent to the viewer than the first film (The Matrix folks should be taking notes).  Continuing the trend from the extended version of the first movie, this edition seamlessly integrates footage that was not included with the original movie release, adding important detail and minor plot points previously shorn only for brevity (the Harry Potter DVD folks should be taking notes, too).  The added scenes in \\"Fellowship\\" extrapolated upon and added to the flavor of that film in ways that made watching it seem like seeing a whole new movie.  Expect the same result with \\"Two Towers\\": a visual masterpiece that absorbs you into the story even more fully than before.<br />NO, IT DOES NOT for a number of reasons: This movie does not raise the bar from what was accomplished with \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  In that regard, it probably deserves more like 4.9 stars.  Another reviewer likened this installment to \\"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\\"  I cannot improve upon that assessment.  The story is still excellent, but the the people, places, and, consequently, the overall mood of the movie, are much darker.  Frodo, for one, is much more grim and moody, reflecting the baleful influence of the Ring upon him.  Since the characters have been established from the first movie, character depth now gives way somewhat to the storyline.  For instance, Pippen and Merry are notably only bit players in this film and have little to say, making them far less entertaining than they appeared in the first film.  With any luck, the added/extended material should improve this lapse.<br />It should also be noted that the movie's attention to detail refers to VISUAL detail -- if you are a book purist who is bothered by minor departures from the story as Tolkien wrote it, this movie is not for you.  Expect minor alterations akin to those exhibited in \\"Fellowship\\" and more of them.  Overall, the story remains the same.  It's still a must-see, just don't expect the book.<br />Parents of pre-teen children should be cautioned that the graphic violence exhibited in the first movie is just as pronounced in this one, and it occurs on a much grander scale.  The carnage is neither worse nor better than the first movie, there's simply more of it.
B00005JLXE|1.0|This movie  is one of the worst  superhero films ever. Ben Afleck  besides being a mediocre  actor  could  not save this movie. It is a  flick based on  a  fine  story but was turned into  rubish. Sorry to say but   the whole film was so  cheesy I could not wait to the end of  it. BAD acting  mixed with terible  directing.
0345409671|5.0|When I completed Rice's fifth vampire book, never had I been more excited. I finished the book rather quickly because I would sit for hours turning page after page, so caught up in Memnoch's tale, Rice's florid style and imaginitive storytelling.<br />Reader, be forewarned. This installment is completely different from its four prequels. Don't buy the book expecting the horrid vampirism of 'Interview' and 'Damned' or the fairytale lucidity of 'Lestat.' This book is Satan's story, as the title so obviously points out. And Rice crafts Satan, here called Memnoch, into a very deep character. You fall in love with him just as you did with Lestat, Louis, or Armand.<br />And his explanation of the creation of the universe, the purpose of God, the nature of man and his relationship to the angels is so compelling (but uncomfortably dark) that I felt I had to keep my Bible and this book a safe distance from each other. Not, that the book is blasphemous; it is just not a very rigid Christian interpretation of God or the mechanics of the universe.<br />The greatest moments in the book are its unexpected twists, the long and beautiful dialogue between Lestat and Memnoch, and the metamorphosis Lestat undergoes, just as he did in 'Body Thief.' Lestat gets to visit Heaven and Hell, he meets God and witnesses the crucifixion.<BR>Glorious, compelling, wonderful.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ok ive been a Metallica fan for a short time, but after listening and buying Master of Puppets i became a fan of metallica instantly and thought that that album would be untouchable. boy was I wrong. So sitting at the local cd store i was like hmmm new St. Anger or old Ride the lightning. Of course I went with ride the lightning, and boy was I wrong about Master of Puppets being untouchable!, Still not as good as Master of Puppets, it gives that album a run for its money. this cd rules! 5/5 is an understatement
B00006879E|5.0|Great!  Listened to the whole cd on my way home from work and loved the entire thing.  I didn't feel like I had to skip through songs like I do on most cd's but instead, I just kept letting them flow along.
0385504209|2.0|7/17/03<br />The DaVinci Code<br /> In this best selling thriller, the second in a series about the renowned symbologist Robert Langdon (a modern day Indiana Jones), Brown takes us through one of history's more inflammatory legends in an action-packed ride through historical haunts of Paris and England.<br /> There are many good things about this book. First of all, Dan Brown's skill for puzzle making is great, making the reader really want to figure out the conundrums before the protagonists do. I often found myself scouring the Internet for clues to crack the case while reading along, hoping Google would give me the answer first. Secondly, there are some beautiful descriptions of European churches and other famous historical landmarks. When reading about the Louvre, I often felt I was in Paris, watching the events take place. But the most interesting thing about this book is Brown's wealth knowledge about ancient legends and the history of many secret societies. Regardless of your religious persuasion, the premises of this book are interesting, at the very least. And the amount of information about symbology and history that he imparts through character conversations is staggering. I honestly feel that I learned a lot from this book, but this is where the problem begins.<br /> I don't know what is true and what is false. Basically, the premise is that Jesus Christ was the husband of Mary Magdalene, who the Catholic church later besmirched as a whore to combat this knowledge. Supposedly, the true message of Jesus was one of sexual equality and the \\"sacred feminine,\\" which was covered up by white males who liked their power too much, specifically the Catholic Church. What's more, Mary was pregnant when Christ was crucified, and His descendants are still alive in the Merovingian line, protected by the Priory of Sion.  The Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion were created to protect this knowledge from the Church, who has been seeking it's destruction. The knowledge and practices of the \\"sacred feminine\\" (basically, orgies as religion), Mary's physical body, her descendants, and the knowledge about her connection to Jesus are revealed to be the Holy Grail, which is figurative (Mary holds Christ's blood by having his baby), rather than the literal chalice which held Christ's blood. They call this line the Royal line, despite the fact that, in this book's philosophy, Jesus is neither God nor anything more than a great man. His divinity was decreed by the Council of Nicaea, and was not the original belief of any of Christ peers.  What's even more impossible to believe is that Christ's \\"rock,\\" the man on who he would build his church, was supposedly Mary, but this role was usurped by a jealous Peter, who can be seen attempting to murder Mary in the Last Supper by DaVinci. There's plenty more about DaVinci's (who was a Grand Master of the Priory of Sion, along with such other notable figures as Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, and Victor Hugo) subversive works. The conclusion is unsatisfying, as Brown lets the big secret out of the bag halfway through, and I read on to find that the philosophy was all packed in the middle, while the beginning and the end were soulless plot.  Throughout the plot, both the Priory of Sion and a Catholic organization, Opus Dei, fight to discover the truth about the Grail. While Brown avoids vilifying any specific Catholics or Christians, this is little recompense for his merciless slander of the Church and the tenets upon which it rests.<br /> The second shortcoming of this book is that every character is one dimensional, with few exceptions. While they do some surprising things, and there certainly is enough plot twists to warrant the label \\"thriller,\\" the characters frequently launch into summaries of history and symbology at the most peculiar times.  By the end of the book, I got the impression that the characters and the whole of the plot existed just as a podium for Dan Brown to shout his interestingviews, similar to the way the Left Behind series of books exists for little purpose than propagation of a narrow set of Apocalyptic views.  It's ironic that books from such opposing worldviews share such a big similarity.<br /> In conclusion, I would not recommend this book. In particular, Christians should stay away, as it has many inflammatory themes and lots of slanderous accusations. There are many great things about this book, namely the puzzles, the locations and the history, but the bad far outweighs the good, as a whole.  This book is Left Behind for pagans seeking the sacred feminine.iews, similar to the way the Left Behind series of books exists for little purpose than propagation of a narrow set of Apocalyptic views.

If you love a good romantic movie then this is for you. I usually hate musicals but this one is SOOO good!! Julie Andrews and Christopher Plumber did an excellent job in this movie. Movies from the 60's usually aren't the best but this one is different. This is a great movie to watch on a family night. It's definitely a must see!!

0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai is a classic movie directed by Akira Kurosawa that is a simple story, but ends up being much, much more.  Set in early 16th Century Japan, the story begins with a small farming village discovering that when their crops grow, a gang of bandits will attack the village and steal the harvest.  The village patriarch recommends they hire samurai to protect the village.  They meet Kambei, who organizes a group of six other samurai together to fight all of them with their own reason for fighting.  The samurai teach the villagers how to fight while also preparing a defense plan for when the bandits return.  This is a great movie that never slows down.  Even at 207 minutes, the movie flies by never wasting a second to show or tell something important.  You can see the motivations behind the samurai as well as the fear of the villagers as they prepare for the upcoming battle with the bandits.  The action scenes are truly extraordinary.  Years before Sam Peckinpah used slow motion in The Wild Bunch, Kurosawa uses it early in the movie during two swordfights, both of which show the pointlessness of the violence.  The attack by the gang of bandits is remarkably done, especially the final battle as the rain pours down on the villagers and the bandits.<br />  The great Japanese star Toshiro Mifune plays Kikuchiyo, the samurai who wants to prove that he is better than his roots as a simple farmer, the same people he is defending.  He has one very funny scene when the bandits arrive as he taunts their arrival.  Takashi Shimura is fantastic as Kambei, the noble leader of the samurai who organizes them and helps to keep them together during the battle.  Shichiroji, the courageous fighter and builder, is played by Daisuke Kato.  Isao Kimura plays Katsushiro, the young, unproven samurai who falls in love with a girl in the village.  Minoru Chiaki is Heihachi, the samurai who may not have the best ability, but enjoys keeping the others happy with his jovial manner.  Seiji Miyaguchi plays Kyuzo, the expert swordsman who always tries to perfect his craft.  Yoshio Inaba stars as Gorobei, Kambei's right hand man who is deadly with a bow.  The Criterion Collection DVD is well worth the purchase.  It offers the theatrical trailer, restored picture and sound, and also commentary by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck.  This is a true classic that must be seen to be fully enjoyed.  Just writing about it does not do justice to how good this movie really is.  Do not miss!

Because it is the best movie ever made. The movie starts out with John Williams best score ever and then takes into a world of advanced science, supreme architecture, and cool clothes, \\"KRYTON\\"! But on the planets dying day a father sends his only son on a small spacecraft for one which will take him far far away from any danger from the exploding planet. Next you will be amazed and adore when the spacecraft lands on Earth in a small town in Kansas, when a farmer and his wife discover the craft and find a son, and to put into a thrill ride that son just happens to have super strength, super hearing, x-ray vision, is indestructible, the ability to shoot lazier beams, can fly, and grows up to be \\"SUPERMAN\\"! people will screem oncore, oncore, oncore at the end of this movie, some might just cry them selves to sleep because there was movie like this made.
B000094A6A|5.0|I just bought this movie on DVD.  My boyfriend and I laughed hysterically during it.  Frank the Tank is my favorite character.  He's streaking, drinking, singing and his love for BLUE was hysterical.  I have watched it a couple of times and still bust out laughing!!  A must have for a fun night of either co-ed party or either boys night or girls night!!  HYSTERICAL!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is simply one of the best and most emotionaly challenging movie i've ever seen. The main characters are brilliantly portrayed by actors with the most on screen chemistry i've seen in years. The four main characters; Sara Goldfarb(mother), Harry(addict son), Tyrone(addict's freind), and Marion(addict's girlfreind), each have their own ideas of what true happiness is, and on their respective paths to find this &quot;happiness&quot; they wind up in an extreme downward spiral, finding themselves in a completely desolate state of self pity and dispair.
0385508417|4.0|I have had this book on my bookshelf like many of my other ones, that I have no read yet.  I finished it in 3 hrs.  Luther is such a tan BAH-MUMBUG' in this book until the one fateful call from his daughter, that makes his wife spin into action on Christmas Eve to get the Christmas spirit going, in a not so cheerfull house.  With the help of their neighbors and the community, they are able to pull it off with out a hitch.  My only question for this book is.  Did they get the tree back to the rightful owners, before they returned and did his wife and family find out about it???  Cute little book, you can definatly tell this was written from a males point of view.  Nice to read about Christmas in July, my own little treat.
B000002IG4|4.0|This is a good Phil Collins solo recording based on some nice pop flavored arrangements.  Some tones are more cheerful.  Others like I Don't Care Anymore have a bitter angry tone.  But many of Phil Collins' tallents as a singer and drummer are utilized here.<br />The album closer, Why Can't It Wait Until Morning is a perfect song to fall asleep to based on the reassuring tones.  After a hard day's work, Phil's gentle tones are a perfect antitdote.  You Can't Hurry Love, Thru These Walls, and I Can Not Believe Its True are other album highlights.<br />Some of Phil's later solo work is a bit spotty, but this one is quite strong. It is certainly worth a listen.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Disclaimer: I haven't seen the extended version yet, but the theatrical movie is the best adaptation of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to date.  I'm looking forward to the extended scenes to fill out the story; the extra scenes did a phenomonal job of improving The Fellowship of the Ring.<br />I have read this series and Tolkien's Silmarillion numerous times (actually I listen to the series recorded on CD; note that the Silmarillion is a lot eaiser to get through this way) and I was disappointed with only two things: 1) The extreme departure of Faramir's character in the movie vs. the book (in the book, he resisted the Ring's lure in the cave of Henneth Annun, where they first brought the hobbits, and sent Frodo, Sam, and Gollum on their way with extra supplies.  The fact that he could resist the Ring's influence from the start proved his worthiness as a leader of Men.)  2) The decision of Peter Jackson to end the movie where it did (I would have ended it on the stairs before Cirith Ungol, after the hobbits saw the Morgul-King's army march out towards Minas Tirith...give the audience another suspenseful set-up for Return of the King).  Other than that, I can accept and enjoy all the other changes that Jackson made.  Kudos to everyone involved.  Great movie!
0452282152|5.0|This book had me from the first sentence. It tells a believable story behind one of Vermeer's finest paintings.Although fiction, you begin to believe this actually happend.It is also a story about a young girl becoming a woman in the 1600's and it tells this part of her life in a tactful manner. I could not put it down and read it within a day. I would love to see more books like this in the future.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Another milestone or anniversary, another re-packaged film. One wonders how many more times this 1978 classic will be released onto the public. If they keep making the DVD treatment with great special features like this one, then more the merrier. What could they possibly do with another re-issue?. Outdo themselves. That's what. This is a great 25th anniversary edition of the film with special features that every hardcore fan will devour. As a fan who has three different versions of this film, I can't wait for this. This edition features the film looking and sounding incredible, but what really makes it is the extras. As usual, there are radio spots, trailers, bios, and a still gallery. What makes it fantastic is that there is audio commentary from writer/director John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, and producer/writer Debra Hill. There is an all new 87 minute documentary with interviews with Carpenter, Curtis, Hill, and dozens more. There is also a 10 minute special with Hill and actress P.J. Soles(Lynda) re-visiting the original Myers house used in the film. Plus there is a 16 page booklet!!. How can any fan refuse?!. You can't. Apparently, the one star review below doesn't know what's going on. I've seen the TV version and it definitley wasn't 104 minutes. 13 extra minutes?. I doubt if the deleted scenes totaled 10 minutes. Anyways, this is a great set with plenty of new stuff to offer. The story takes place in a quaint little town of Haddonfield, Illinois. 6 year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his sister in 1963, and was then sent to a mental institution. While there, he was observed by Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasence). 15 years later, in 1978, Michael manages to escape the place and head back to his hometown to reak terror and vengeance upon the unknowing little town. Loomis, with the help of the town sheriff, Sheriff Brackett(Charles Cyphers), tries to track down the cold blooded killer before a body count happens. Enter virginal Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis). She is the unlucky target, as Michael stalks her and two friends Annie(Nancy Loomis), and Lynda(P.J. Soles), while they are babysitting across the street from each other on Halloween night. This was supposed to be a creepy, scary, suspenseful film, and that's exactly what it is. No gore or blood and guts. It's a very simple, basic movie that tells a very simple, basic story, and is done in a very basic, simple way. If only future sequels were made that way. What makes it even more chilling is how real it is. It takes place in a nice little town, in a charming, family type neighborhood. It shows that this kind of thing can happen to anyone anywhere. The realisticness of the film and characters lost some credibility in later films, but this one is what's out there in the real world. Scary to think. Curtis is wonderful as Laurie. She gets the shy, awkward, gawky thing down pat. She makes Laurie a real fleshed out person, instead of just another pretty face actress trying to seem innocent and pure when we know she isn't. Pleasence is teriffic. Loomis is a classic screen character that gets even madder as the films go on. Carpenter knows how to scare us. What's so amazing about it is how easy it is to do it, and how easy it was for him to accomplish it. While other films try too hard and create ridiculous circumstances with gore and effects to try to scare you, this one just relies on what is real. What could be outside your door, or under your bed. This is one of the scariest movies ever. The theme, also done by Carpenter, is another classic. All in all, \\"Halloween\\" is a monumental film classic that should be cherished by all. This special new edition is chalked full of nothing but goodies and every fan should rush out to get it when it is available. Happy trick or treating.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I believe that this movie is one of the greatest.  Hugh Jackman is the man, sexy, tough, the man of the year. Sexist man of all times. Wish that I could meet him and let him know he is the sex god to all women. I saw him on the awards show, that long hair is the sexiest. Love all of his movies.
B000002KD9|5.0|While Neil Young's quivering voice and minimalist guitar style may be acquired tastes (his one-note repetitive solo on &quot;Cinnimon Girl&quot; from &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; remains one of the greatest acts of rock and roll chuzpha ever), his musical integrity and songwriting have never been questioned. After a somewhat overproduced initial effort (&quot;Neil Young&quot;) and a grungy second (&quot;Everybody Knows . . . &quot;), Young struck a personal (and a surprisingly commercially successful) chord with &quot;After the Gold Rush.&quot; Only two of the songs here really qualify as rockers (&quot;Southern Man&quot; and &quot;When You Dance You Can Really Love&quot;), yet the spare readings and instrumentation of &quot;Tell Me Why,&quot; &quot;Don't Let It Bring You Down,&quot; &quot;I Believe in You,&quot; and the title song afforded Young a unique identity among  the pack of singer-songwriters of the early '70's. And his transformation of Don Gibson's &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot; from jaunty honky-tonk to emotional lament was one of the more daring cover version efforts in modern musical history.<br />Young's love/hate relationship with Stephen Stills in Buffalo Springfield and CSNY are well documented, and in retrospect, it almost seemed an impossible task to confine Young's vision in either of these bands. Neil Young, plain and simple, is a musical force of nature - and &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; brought this into clear focus.
B00006JMXH|5.0|I love this CD it's got Alota Great songs and might even make you appreciate the artist even more.. If You love this CD I recommend all of there CD's too...lol trust me you'll Love it.
B000002MUW|4.0|One of my favorite CDS (I love American life even more) is BEDTIME STORIES, I GIVE IT 4.4/5 stars because although filled with slow songs, it was so good, I'm a dance fan usually, I like well paced beats that make your head bob, and I really think that Bedtime stories was lacking that. I like it though, number 10, 7, 6, 1, 11 and 4 were the best, yet every song was above average, buy it! It's worth it.

B000089RVX|5.0|I buy this CD yesterday and I listen to the lyric and instruments. Amazing sound and very original compare with other production in the recent years. Some people say this group is similar with Linkin Park, but I don't think this simple comparison is fair to the quality of this CD. Many group share a common \\"feel\\" so we can compare with many Alt Rock CDs, but still the sound is excellent.<br />I have trouble to say the name of the group correctly, but I love the music!!! If you like Alt Rock or generally rock with fluid instrument and voice - you will like this CD.
6304383177|5.0|The best of the screwball comedies.  Katharine Hepburn is gorgeous, the epitome of the beautiful young woman high on life and its possibilities.  Cary Grant is handsome even with his glasses on and just the perfect match for Kate as the too serious young man who starts to live when he meets her.  Wonderful supporting cast and funny dialogue that keeps you on your toes.  This movie makes you laugh out loud and feel very good after you've spent two hours with Baby and friends.
B00006AL1G|5.0|Wow!<br />history of hip hop in the truest.<br />lessons on how to scratch.<br />deep looks into the thoughts of famous dj's.<br />excellent production.<br />Cop this Dvd ... NOW!
0790743221|5.0|A perfect movie. Wonderful storyline,witty and fast-paced dialogue, beautiful clothes and Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn at the peak of their wit,charm,and beauty plus Jimmy Stewart in the role that won him an Oscar. This movie takes you into the world of the rich, privileged beautiful people and lets you get caught up in that world and have fun while you are doing it.<BR>Have a glass of champagne and enjoy the fizz.
B000088E6D|5.0|I may live in the United States now but I am definitely still proud to be a Canadian! And with that said, I am also proud of the amazingly talented Canadians in the music industry like Michael Buble! This is a wonderful CD!! What a smooth, velvety voice, reminiscent of Sinatra. There is a great variety of music selection on this CD. A little Van Morrison, in there, old school rock, even a duet with Barry Gibb and a good remake of Lou Rawls-\\"You're gonna miss my lovin\\". <BR>Please, this is not like Harry Connick Jr!! It's not bluesy at times like Connick. It seems to ooze a more sophisticated feel and atmosphere. Great dinner music when you entertain. If you like the sounds of Sinatra, you'll love Michael Buble. He's the Sinatra for the 21st century.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is by far the best music album I have ever purchased. Evanescence has a great look and great sound.  Normally when I by an album I end up liking only 2-3 songs on the disc.  But with fallen every song is great.  I have spent many hours listening to this Cd and I can't wait until they release another album.
0790731924|4.0|THIS TIME, RIGGS AND MURTAUGH RETURN TO FACE SOUTH AFRICAN DRUG RUNNERS WHO HIDE BEHIND DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. THIS MOVIE, LIKE THE FIRST, HAS GREAT ACTION, GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, AND GREAT PLOT. AND THIS MOVIE JUST MIGHT BE EVEN MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE FIRST! WHICH IS VERY RARE IN MOVIES. JOE PESCI IS GREAT AS LEO GETZ, THE MAN THAT RIGGS AND MURTAUGH ARE ASSIGNED TO WATCH OVER SINCE HE'S TESTIFYING AGAINST THE DRUG RUNNERS. THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO MISS. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET OR IF YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT IT YET, I'D ADVISE YOU TO DO SO. YOU'LL DEFINITELY GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH.
0783226063|3.0|This version is adequate if you haven't read Dune.  Dune is too complex a novel to portray in 137 minutes.   I have seen the long version on Sci Fi (Not the TV Version) and it fills in more gaps that the Dune enthusiast is expecting to see.  Even still the I find it could be expanded more.  The original director refuses to be associated with the longer version; a mistake, <br />The TV version has filled in most of those gaps but made some &quot;changes&quot; for which I can still not rationalize why (Nowhere do they use his fremen name Usul?)<br />I recomend you buy them both, and if you are lucky enough, record the long version whenever SciFi runs it again.
0767811070|4.0|NO MOVIE CAPTURES THE REALNESS OF THE L.A. GHETTOS LIKE THIS ONE. THE PLOT REVOLVES AROUND THREE BOYS THAT LIVE THERE, TRE [CUBA GOODING, JR.] WHO WANTS TO GET OUT OF THE HOOD, TRE'S GOOD FRIEND RICKY [MORRIS CHESTNUT], WHO WANTS TO GO TO COLLEGE AND BECOME A FOOTBALL PLAYER, AND DOUGHBOY [ICE CUBE], A WOULD BE GANGBANGER WHO LIKES IT IN THE HOOD. BUT TRAGEDY STRIKES WHEN A GROUP OF GANG BANGERS VICIOUSLY GUN DOWN RICKY. AND NOW THERE SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY WAY FOR PAYBACK IS VIOLENCE. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY TOUCHING AND IT'S REALLY ON THE MONEY. IT'S PRETTY SAD TO SEE THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS FINALLY GONNA DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR LIFE, IT GETS TAKEN AWAY FOR BS REASONS. THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES TO ACCURATELY DEPICT WHAT GOES ON IN THE HOOD. THE IMPACT OF THIS MOVIE SHOULD TELL PEOPLE THAT GUNS AND GANGS AREN'T THE WAY TO GO. THIS IS STILL THE BEST HOOD MOVIE TO EVER BE RELEASED.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This was a good CD, but not necessarily worth full price. His single &quot;No Such Thing&quot; isn't really a good indicator of the whole CD. Its more acoustic then that. Overall, a good listen.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Terrific for driving, this CD contains the great band's most popular and well loved hit.  The sound is great...only wish it were a 2 CD set!  Stick this one in the glove compartment and enjoy.

B00008PW3Q|3.0|Love 'em, and kinda bought into the new CD because of all the play a couple tracks have been getting on the radio.  But is it just me, or is this a tired half-effort of their usual brilliance??  Very disappointing, but I keep playing it with the hope that soon the familiarity of it will bring a better liking for me....
0345350499|4.0|I borrowed this from a friend and she bought me a copy of my own.  This is a unique look at a different point of view during King Arthur's time.  Once you get involved with this book it's difficult to put down at times.  Slow beginning but amazing ending.
6300182355|5.0|They tried to make a movie that looked like and felt like a comic.   To my mind they succeeded wildly.  Using a first class cast and a campy, well written script the movie is a lot of fun to watch, especially if one liked the music of Queen. <br />There are lots of cool lines of dialog that are delivered with pinash.   <br />Flash Gordon, NY Jets!  <BR>This Mings a Psycho!  <BR>Flash!  AAAAHHHH, He'll save every one of us.  <BR>Flash!  Ah Ahhh... he's a miracle!  <BR>Bring me the Boar Worms.  <BR>Gordon is Alive!  <BR>I like to play with things for a while... before annihilation.  <br />Now, I'll admit this movie is not for everyone.  My wife and daughters don't care for it.  2 of my 3 sons like it though, and of course, I love it.  <br />You can even let the kids watch it.  There is not nudity, no simulated sex and no foul language.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This masterpiece has everything that defines 'Broadway Musical'.<br />An absolute joy to wallow in. Fantastic music, production, acting, dance, sound, art design, photography, everything. <br />The maturity of the cast is a testament to the care the makers took to reflect the snappy boards of yesteryear when music was half percussive precision, half soaring reeds and snappy brass. And all the artists had 10-20 years under their belts before they had the chance to strut their stuff big time.<br />No need to compare this to other flicks. On the other hand, if you check out All That Jazz (1979 by Fosse who created the original 1970 Chicago stageplay) you will see dance and music reflected and even improved. And if you want to wriggle into major retro, Pajama Game (1954) is where Fosse got his creative start - and you can see the seeds of his genius.<br />Any student of the genre will own this. Stage musical history is defined here.
B00006F7IM|5.0|Major League is one of my favorite comedies and one of my favorite baseball movies.  The fact that it is a baseball comedy only makes things better.  The premise is that the Cleveland Indians have a new owner and she wants to move the team to Miami (because of the perks she'll get).  To do this, the attendance for the season has to dip below a certain number (800,000 I believe).  So, she gets rid of most of the regular players and invites a bunch of has-been and never-was players to training camp.  She tries to build a team designed to lose, and come in dead last.<br />Much is made of the fact that the Indians have not won a pennant in over 30 years and nobody expects them to do well.  The team is stocked with over the hill players like  Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger): a washed up catcher with bad knees who they found playing in the Mexican league, Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen): the third baseman who is scared of being hit by the ball; and players that never were stars like Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen): a pitcher with no control serving time in prison for stealing a car, and Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes): the centerfielder with blazing speed but can't hit, and Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert): a voodoo practicing slugger who can't hit a curveball.<br />With this misfit team, we go through Spring Training and the regular season.  As the season progresses the team starts playing better than the owner had hoped so she keeps taking away essentials like the team plane, the hot tub, hot water, and others.  The team plays even better until the whole plot is revealed by the General Manager of the franchise.  This gives the Indians the fire they need to be a contender and make a run for the post season (since this might be the only chance these players get).<br />Major League is an incredibly funny movie and remains one of my favorites.  I laugh at all the places I used to and I find the mix of baseball and humor in this movie to be nearly perfect.  One thing to note is that there is a lot of swearing in this movie and repeated use of the \\"F\\" word, so if that is the sort of thing that bothers you:  you have been warned.  Otherwise, this is one of the best baseball movie and is a blast to watch and watch again.at there is a lot of swearing in this movie and repeated use of the \\"F\\" word, so if that is the sort of thing that bothers you:  you have been warned.

B00005JKOI|3.0|I actually give this movie 2.5 stars, but I'll be generous and round that up to three.<br />Overall, this movie was average. It was somewhat enjoyable, and rather interesting. However, there, of course, was one major problem. And that was the ending. I'm not going to ruin it for anyone (if you've seen it, you know what I am talking about), but I really felt cheated, and it made me want to vomit. See it and you'll know what I mean (unless you're stuck-up and/or heartless).<br />But it's worth watching just for Duckie. Go Duckie!
B000068PQ0|5.0|A concept album about a Japaese girl fighting robots, with lyrics about war, death, summertime and vitamins? Sounds like a pompous nightmare, but somehow The Flaming Lips turn it into a winner.<br />The album's opener, Fight Test, may have borrowed its tune from Cat Stevens (unintentionally, the band insist), but the lyrics are profound and challenging, a theme which runs through the whole album. The whole thing flows together, creating a sophisticated narrative. Keyboards are the musical focal point, with a developed musical vibe, mellowed out, and acoustic guitars and electronic sounds prominant in places.<br />Mellow heights are really hit with It's Summertime and All We Have is Now, while Do You Realise?? is a triumph of simple lyrics used effectively, and a great truism about the sun not going down.<br />The two part title track stands out as well, despite those madcap lyrics and bloops, as does Ego Tripping, but individual tracks are only half of the appeal here. <br />Really you have to listen to it as a coherent whole to appreciate the magic, the complexity, and the brilliance of this incredible album. The range of emotions conveyed includes regret, envy, love, optimism, struggle and finally death. It's sad that Sum 41 and the like outsell this by so much.
B0000028M7|5.0|Well, the title really says it all.  This is my favorite of their albums, and I own them all.  Unfortunately, most of the songs on this album are too true, considering the fate that recently befell their lead singer.  But this cd was released at the height of Seattle grunge, and it just doesn't get any better than this.  You think Nirvana was great?  They can't hold a candle to this cd.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I have an obsession with garlic presses and unfortunately a rather to strong grip.  Which means that I've gone through about 5 &quot;goodgrip&quot; garlic presses as they break at the hinge from metal fatigue eventually.  I have used them ALL - from A to Z.  The IKO is very good but hard to clean.  This Rosle is easy to clean - powerful enough to put unpeeled cloves in and easily squeezed out and becauwse of the popup strainer - extremely easy to clean..... I've had it for two weeks - I use it at least once a day.... The final test will be to see if it lasts.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This Cd is really kool. Really Catchy Lyrics. Hot Lead singer
B00000JQFM|5.0|After taking just one listen to SURFING WITH THE ALIEN, I can clearly state that Joe Satriani is one of the most creative, melodic, and precise guitar players out there today.  Satch goes through so many styles on this all-instrumental album that it makes its paltry 37-minute running time all the more short.  This is really the making of a master.  Before SURFING, instrumental albums were known as being pretentious and unlistenable.  Not so here.  Satriani can shred and go off on a tangent with the best of them, but he chooses never to overplay.  Instead, it's all about the tone, the feel, the arrangement, and the melody rather than just going in the studio and recording whacked-out jams.<br />Speaking of melody, these 10 songs are loaded with them.  Every song is extremely catchy, given the fact that they're ALL instrumentals.  That is the testament of Satch's talent and he still delivers his melodic punch to this day.  Where do I begin?  This is some really great music.  The opening title track, &quot;Crushing Day,&quot; and &quot;Lords of Karma&quot; are groovy, heavy rockers with killer riffs, rapid-fire solos, and great melodies.  &quot;Always with Me, Always with You&quot; is a lovely, powerful ballad that proves you don't need lyrics to convey emotion.  Satch's solo on that song kind of sounds like stars twinkling in the night sky.  A wonderful feeling.<br />&quot;Satch Boogie&quot; is the fastest song on the album which sounds like ZZ Top's &quot;La Grange&quot; on steroids; &quot;Midnight&quot; is a short little piece filled all-tapping techniques and a nice, danceable rhythm; and &quot;Echo&quot; is a slow bluesy number to close the album out and it's a nice alternative to all the madness that has gone on.  The best of the bunch is &quot;Circles.&quot;  This song is only 3:28, but Satch keeps throwing surprises throughout it.  It starts off as a moody Latin-inspired acoustic piece, until the 1:00 mark where the bass drum kicks in and Satch unleashes a bloodthirsty, ferocious solo from out of left field.  This speed continues, until another time change occurs around the 2:14 mark where the main acoustic theme is repeated and the song closes out with some rhythmic touches.  You won't believe it till you hear it.<br />This is a really, strong consistent album that was totally unlike anything else in metal around that time.  SURFING WITH THE ALIEN became Satch's breakout album and launched him to a long and fruitful career.  And think about it: when Satch was a guitar teacher, he gave lessons to Metallica's Kirk Hammett.  It's ironic that Satch is still making great music and Hammett is wallowing in the dismal corridors of what used to be Metallica.  Just think about it.
B00005YW4H|1.0|You've got to wonder about the Grammy awards when a lightweight piece of fluff like this wins in a major category.  Maybe Norah Jones's whispery little-girl voice works for all the budding dirty old men out there, but to me it is the stimulus to see how quickly I can change the station.  In my opinion, this young woman's breathy mewing is as irritating as nails screeching down a blackboard.  Her future lies in doing voice-over promos for children's television shows.
B00005JM09|5.0|Ok...this movie was great! It had a really good plot and follewed the other movies really well. It had totally awesome action scenes and the performances by Nick stahl and Claire danes were really good.This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and waiting for the T4. There is gonna havta b a T4 now b/c this movie leaves me hanging and praying for a new one. I really hope Nick stahl gets more roles and stuff cause he definatley does better at playing john connor than edward furlong(or w/e the hell his name was). THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!<BR>p.s- Arnold's one-liners are hilarious
B000002B2X|5.0|A nice change of pace after the grittiness of &quot;Facelift&quot;...and it really kind of prepares you for the jolt of &quot;Dirt&quot;.  I really love this album alot, and it has my favorite song by them, which is &quot;Got me Wrong&quot;, although they are all good.  It's just too bad that they won't be able to bring back the old magic they used to have together.

B00008DDSC|4.0|Secretary is a black comedy piece from director Steven Shainberg.  Shainberg previously directed the forgettable \\"Hit Me\\", and it's clear from this film, that he's growing into his craft.  The film is worthy of the acclaim it received, although it will never be a mainstream favorite.  Both James Spader, who has made a career of quirky parts, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, in her first major role, are outstanding as brooding employer/employee who share a dark secret of dominance.<br />Lee, Gyllenhaal's character, invented the word dysfunctional, and exhibits destructive behavior, even though she's just been released from a psychiatric care facility.  Lee's a cutter, and just having her back in the house again is upsetting for the rest of her loony family.<br />The film makes you feel as though you are with Lee, waiting to determine whatever it is in life that could possibly make her happy.  You begin to think she's stumbled into the subservient role as secretary to the tightly wrapped E. Edward Gray, awaiting his commands, whatever they might be.  It is only as the relationship evolves that you can see how much they both gain from it, and how this becomes a romance that perhaps only the two of them can appreciate.  Shainberg's given us a film that is a rich tapestry of color and movement,  he's made us care about his wounded and complex characters, and placed comic touches in a film that doesn't become either voyeuristic or over-the-top with kinky images.<br />Viewers be warned, there are a number of fetishes played out on the screen, bondage, and nudity.  There probably could have been an NC-17 rating assigned to the film.  But if you skip it, due to this, be aware that you may be missing the beginning of two great careers, those of Shainberg &amp; Gyllenhaal; as well as some of Spader's best work.<br />Technically, the DVD has little to offer beyond the film itself. Had it had some depth, I might well have rated this 5 stars!
0316666343|1.0|After hearing great things about this book, I decided to read it. It starts out about a girl who is murdered and can watch what's happening on Earth from Heaven. The book takes this narrative point for a while, switching back and forth from Earth to the girl. After a while though,the narrative stays on Earth, rarely going back to the girl. It gets very boring at this point, because they basically stop the murder investigation and the book just becomes about these people's lives. Very unsatisfying ending. I high DISreccommend this book.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Al Pacino does an unforgetable performence as Tony Montana. But the movie is not great just because of Al Pacino. It's filled with extrodeniary talent on and off screen. With unforgetable cast of actors and actresses that bring unforgetable characters to life. Briand De Palma does an amzing job of turning this movie into a modern day Godfather. And last but certainly not least Oliver Stone. Oliver Stone does a magnificent of writing the screenplay to this movie. No doubt in any critic's mind that this film will stand the test of time and become one of Hollywood's greatest film's.
B000088DTS|5.0|I have to tell you, 'Innocent Eyes' is exceptional, it is unique and worth every cent! Delta Goodrem has the most beautiful voice and her beautiful piano ballads reflect that. My very favourite songs would be 'Innocent Eyes'(track 2), 'Lost Without you'(5) and 'Not me, Not I'(3) but i still love the rest. This album went double platnium (140,000 copies sold) in only its SECOND week and debuted at #1 so you can be assured that it is a hit! I cannot express anymore praise for this brilliant album, i reccomend everyone who hasn't heard her music to BUY THIS ALBUM because it is wonderful. Another good thing about it is that Delta wrote or co-wrote almost every track on this album, if you listen to the words you really realise how realistic it is. She wrote them from her experiences and I don't know how many of you have heard but she has just been diagonosed with Hodgskins Disease (a form of cancer) at only 18. Please support Delta and her music by buying this album, believe me, you won't regret it.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Great actors, and they saved this movie.  Halle Berry is HORRIBLE, but luckily she isn't in all the scenes.  Travolta and Jackman working together was a dream come true for me because they are my two favorite actors, and even though this movie wasn't as good as it could have been, the fact that they are in it completely redeems it, and makes it watchable.
0451167716|5.0|I read the book first, and watched the movie and its sequels few years later. The book was a page-turner and the language is smooth. But the movie...., sorry to tell you, I fell to sleep halfway although it was awarded the Oscar's Best Movie! I rather enjoyed Bruce Willis's Die Hard.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is, simply genius. I always found it an intriging task to diagnose and analyse great masterpieces such as this, so I'll just start it off by simply saying that KURT IS GOD! or at least buddha. The whole \\"Oh look at me, I'm depressed and suicidal and hate the world\\" stereotype has been worn out so many times since Nirvana but Kurt truly was the epitomy of a sad, sad, sad man. This album perfectly resonates his depression, though not as effectively as his equally brilliant In utero. However, what makes this album so good is that rather confronting his sadness hard on like on In Utero, Kurt sort of does it in a tongue-in-cheek, \\"meh, I hate myself, oh well\\" style, which is a rather unique approach to depressive songs. this is mostly what makes Nevermind Nevermind. The first two tracks alone, SMLT and In Bloom alone, are the only two songs one needs to describe the generation this album was born of. Smells Like Teen Spirit is, as we all know, an immortal, thrashing, rock and roller of a rock and roller, full of pained, angry vocals and some of the most vicious and sharp edged guitar, bass, and drums heard since, well, ever. in Bloom, on the other hand, is stoned, slow, and molten. You can see the visions of a stoned, immobile stoner teen sitting on his couch, dazing into the wall across, with a purple, shiny bong in hand. the rest is a rollicking and powerful alt rock/garage rock album, full of other great songs, such as the pop and punk (not pop/punk) influenced Drain You, my all time favorite Nirvana song. Lithium has a wondefully melancholy and sad verse, with a thrashing, almost insane chorus, and an even more insanity driven bridge and outro. Stay Away's a fine punk rocker of a song, polly's a deliciously dark and bleak acoustic number about a rape, On a Plain, flows in a soothingly strange way, and a whole bunch of other sounds abound here. As for the fine invloved; Kurt is a genius songwriter, and although not a virtuoso guitarist, nevertheless a really, really good one. Krist ain't a John Entwistle, but his marching, intoxicated bass provides perfect rhythm and bite. Dave is the closest the group gets to virtuoso status, with his heavily heavy, pounding, John Bonham gone punk rock drum style. And although some say that this album was overproduced (as well as the band members), think aboput it. If Nevermind had the same production qualities of In utero, it would lose most of its charm, a waltzing on the edges of mainstream and underground charm, and would make the album more dark than needed. All in all, a brilliant album by a brilliant group, Truly one of the greatest albums of all time.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is such a work of art. This one deserves space in your permanent DVD library. Has information that is very relevant to the movie yet was not revealed in the movie. Sooo good.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble's voice is mature, smooth, and sensuous. The voice lingers long after the songs are over, such is the soul he puts in his songs. There is a unique kick that he adds to make each cover his own. I have been listening to his songs over and over again. This is definitely a guy to look out for.
B000002UAO|5.0|A stunner upon release in late 1965,it still is today! Michelle,In my life,Norweigen wood and Girl alone say more then any other bands said in their entire career.
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|I first saw my friend's copy of \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" a year ago.  I was forced to give it back to him, so I bought my own DVD of the movie.  This movie is pretty incredible.  While the movie had very outstanding special effects, Stephen Chow's acting and the ensemble he worked with were both hilarious and delightful.  Stephen Chow is definitely the Jim Carrey of China.  And the soundtrack, I have to say it was very superb.  Definitely complements the movie.  I'm very glad that they're bringing this movie to theaters stateside (even if it is edited).  Definitely warrants watching many times.  I judge all other Far East Asian films to \\"Shaolin Soccer\\", and I have yet found one that exceeds this movie.  Can't express how much this movie never gets old.
B000001OAA|5.0|At the time, it must have seemed like the height of rashness to release an album like \\"Garbage\\" in 1995 - Nirvana was gone, perhaps, but hardly forgotten, and its legions of increasingly crass and debased imitators were turning the airwaves into a nigh-unlistenable morass of hoarse male vocals and unimpressive musicianship.  The alternative movement had started out rebelling against the slick, emotionless pop of the late Eighties but in the process had become just what they'd fought against - namely, boring and commercial.<br />Listening to this album nearly ten years later, it's easy to forget the context of its release - but what Garbage did with this release was to reaffirm that no matter what the fashion du jour, there's always going to be a place for music that combines sleek, glossy production values with canny intelligence and a somewhat skewed worldview.<br />Shirley Manson was, I think, one of the best female vocalists to emerge from the 1990s, and her persona is unique - not a diva, not a granola folkster, not a hard-drinkin' hard-fightin' Janis Joplin wannabe, not an intellectual shrinking violet, and not a tactless come-and-get-me sexual object.  She's her own creature with her own sound: a bit of jazz, a bit of punk, and a voice like a Weimer Berlin torch singer.<br />Garbage's sound is dark and alluring, detached and cerebral but with a core of raw emotion that powers the work.  The music is slick and beautiful, and the production creates a soundscape that rewards repeated listening with new treasures over and over again.  And unlike pop, where sexual content often seems robotic and mechanical, Garbage creates an atmosphere of genuine tension - of bemused perversity and sexual danger, like the Velvet Underground or early Madonna.<br />You can start anywhere with Garbage, but why not start at the beginning?  Though whichever album you buy, I guarantee that it  won't be leaving your playlist for a long, long time.
0380789019|4.0|I read American Gods last year and loved it, eager to read what else the author of the fabulous &quot;Sandman&quot; graphic novels has written, I picked up Neverwhere and read it in a day.<br />Here, Gaiman takes the real life &quot;London Underground&quot; system of subways and tube stations and adds a twist, a magical world beyond the underground, London Below where pockets of lost time and places are filled with the forgotten people of the world.  <br />London Below is a world of Baronies and Fiefdoms, of angels, beasts and killers.  Richard Mayhew, a securities analyst gets drawn into this secret, invisible world when he helps what appears to be an injured homeless woman.  Because of his contact with her and some of the people from her world, he slowly disappears from his own reality.  It seems that most people aboveground cannot deal with the reality of London Below so they conveniently can't see them or anything they do.<br />A classic quest follows with an interesting cast of characters.  Richard and The Lady Door, together with a reprobate Marquis and a bodyguard head off through danger to find answers.  You enter the world of rat speakers, sewer dwellers and secret societies.  It's all very interesting and funny as well as giving the reader the occasional scare.  Below is a world where nothing is what it seems and danger lurks everywhere and yet, its inhabitants seem to derive pleasure from their lives despite that.<br />As with Gods, Gaiman weaves his mythical world into the tapestry of the &quot;reality&quot; of every day life and there are times when you aren't sure if what is happening is just a manifestation of Richard's insanity or not.  It's a nice tension.<br />This book will please the fantasy reader as well as those who love a good mystery.  It's a worthy read.
B000002UYZ|5.0|Only 3 songs - Eleanor Rigby, Yellow Submarine, and Michelle - make this less than a perfect offering.  This is a great sampler of Beatlemania before they moved into the Magical Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper era.
B00003CWPR|5.0|For them to go out on the limb and work together in a film such as this, it takes guts and the sign of a good actor/actress.  Bravo to them for making a groundbreaking film.
B00008DDXC|3.0|It is good to watch, but not as good as Part I . If the special effects were given more attention it would have come out much better.
B000002BSV|5.0|Suede's \\"Coming Up\\" is a great album!  Brett Anderson's vocals are top notch.  Sort of Bowie-ish, with a wide range of highs.  Brett's lyrics are very descriptive and paint a vivid picture of the characters and settings.  As someone else has said this album is sort of glam mixed with romanticism.  I would also like to add that it is a full on rock album too.<br />I feel each song is very strong.  I think there are mostly rocking with maybe 2 slower ballad type songs mixed in.  The rocking songs are usually my favorite at first and then the ballads become my favorite after a while.<br />Richard Oakes, Suede's new guitarist is very good.  There is a lot of crunchy guitar and jangling guitar.<br />Mat Osman has some cool basslines along with Simon Gilbert's drums add an urgency to the music.  Add the guitar to this equation and there is a swagger to the music.<br />I have all of the Suede albums and feel that this album along with the latest album \\"New Morning\\", and 1999's \\"Head Music\\" are their best.  I also recommend SCI-FI Lullabies.<br />My favorite album at this time is \\"Head Music\\".
B000050FEN|5.0|This thriller starts intriguingly: two detectives (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) are trying to solve a murder in which they notice the word \\"gluttony\\" written on the wall. The day after, another kill, this time with the word \\"greed\\" makes them think about the seven deadly sins and five more assassinates to be done. That week will affect these two people in a big way. It develops the connection between them. Pitt's character is younger and more impatient, something not appreciated by the other, who is going to retire after this affair. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars in with the portrayal of Pitt's wife. She always seems miserable and worried about her husband. The menace of the freak is over all the time.<BR>This movie fascinated me so, quite more than Fight Club (although you should aso take a look to this other one). First of all, I think the plot is perfect: a murderer obsession about bad people and punishing them by each capital sin they accomplish. I liked a lot this character, quite well performed by Kevin Spacey, because of his sordid behaviour. Besides, the two detectives will find many surprises, like for example, spectacles drawn on a portrait or the awful vision of a man trapped so long with nothing to eat, but his own tongue!. Fincher's brilliant direction gives a sorrowful view of life, because of all these terrible killings and the feeling that all the bad is always present. Despite what Freeman says at the end, when I finished watching this movie, it gave me the impression that the world is a dark and suffering place,. However, in my opinion, it's one of the best thrillers ever created, and if you like this genre, you MUST buy it. My favourite scene is the final one of the tense conversation with the freak and the painful end, it's wonderfully good! The ending credits will show first who ended up winning.

0385504209|5.0|You will be amazed at the revelations that come forth in this book. Dan Brown uses a fictional story to reveal some fascinating theories concerning the true meaning of the Holy Grail. I had to continually ask myself if what I was reading was &quot;true&quot;, or fiction. I have a Masters degree in the Arts and have never heard of any of the intriguing notions set forth in this book. If you love word origins, you will love this book. If you love the history behind History, you will love this book. I also liked the short chapters (some only one or two pages long) so that I could stop reading quickly when I had to. The trouble is, I didn't want to stop reading! Christians, you have to be really open-minded. But, I think if you are not too literal a reader of the bible, this book will expand your horizons.
0385334206|5.0|this book is not only easy to read but also a lot of fun. the characters are about a wimsical as you cna get. i look forward to reading all of vonnegut's books. this book is incredibly irreverant as well as it deals with psychological illness in a less than traditional fashion.
B00003CXIY|1.0|I'll tell you several reasons so that you don't waste your time with this deplorable movie:<br />1) The plot is very simple: a guy and his friends try to catch a videotape, wrongly sent to his girlfriend, in which he had recorded by mistake a relationship with another chick. This journey will bring them into many illogical situations. I wonder who was in charge of making the screenplay. <br />2) So stupid and boring. Is it supposed to be funny the vision of a man being bitten by a snake or eating a hamster? And what about the foolish teacher who wants the guy to fail? I didn't know that making stupid faces was enough to create a comedy, as Tom Green does all the time. But there are even worse scenes, theoretically invented in order to entertain the audience. <br /> 3) All the time I was trying to laugh a little and enjoy it, in vain. I couldn't find amusing anything. American Pie, another movie which also belongs to this genre was at least supportable, but this rubbish isn't even that. This is the typical teenager movie easily made to succeed. Well, I am a teenager and didn't like it at all.
0792846443|5.0|Paul Shelden, a successful writer, is suddenly involved in a near-fatal car accident during an intense blizzard in the mountains. Following directly behind him the whole time, Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) hurrys and rescues him from the wreck. But instead of taking him to the hospital or calling 911, she takes matters into her own hands and begins caring for her #1 fan in her own home. Things seem normal for Paul at first, but he quickly becomes frightened of Annie's irrational outbursts of anger. As he begins his long recovery, Annie's severe bipolar-like behavior gets violent when she is greatly disappointed with his latest novel. She makes it clear to him that he is to re-write the novel and to never even think about anyone ever finding him. The thoughts of being a prisoner with crazy Annie for the rest of his life leaves him trying to come up with a plan to escape. Although he is physically disabled with two broken legs and an arm, he continuously tries to escape while Annie is out. But things take a terrifying turn when Annie finds out and the violence escalates. Paul now realizes that he is in for a long haul as he tries to re-write his novel the way Annie wants it to be. The movie displays comedy, drama, and suspense which makes it so enjoyable. Annie is so obsessed with Paul she has a candle-lit shrine with pictures of Paul and all of his novels. She even named her pet pig Misery.
B000003S09|5.0|King Crimson's Debut stands s one of the most influential, legendary, and all around awesome debuts- no, records of all time. It features the guitar virtuosity of Robert Fripp, hands down of of the best guitarrists ever, and the strongest singing in all of Greg Lake's career. It started a whole new age of prog and music all together, and blew away any prog band of its time. Simply Revolutionary.<br />The 21st Century Schizoid Man [10/10] Opener is a frantic, hard-hitting masterpiece aided by insane vocoded vocals by Lake and a legendary solo. I talk to the Wind [9/10] is calm, peaceful, flute-driven song that flows like the wind. Epitaph [9.5/10] is wonderfull epic, with a magestic, nostalgic feel. Moonchild [9.5/10] is downright beautiful, or at least the first part, which is followed by 10 minutes of Mellotron Goodness that is good for the soul. The Title Track [10/10] is amazing, a most wonderful epic comprised of several parts. Its the song that got me into King Crimson. Simply put: Amazing.<br />This is one of KCs god-like efforts, rivaled maybe by Larks Tongues, Discipline, or Red. Buy it to be schooled on what started it all.
B00005JM09|1.0|Oh gee! Do we have to pay to see another car commerial? They even tell you what truck they are selling... literally! I am glad that it is not 3 hours long. After the commerial, which was the first half of the movie, people around me began to fall asleep. Just who started the whole idea that putting tv commerial in a moive?!! hmm... oh yea... James Bond. But at least they have sexy models selling me the stuffs. The plot to this movie is exactly the same as the first movie... except that you know what truck they are using to get away from the killing female truck sale person. Please don't go see this movie. It is aweful!
B000055Y0X|5.0|Kubrick produced, directed, and co-authored the screen play of this film, one which has lost none of its bite after almost 40 years. In that same year, Sidney Lumet's Fail Safe was also released. Both pose the same question \\"What if someone accidentally launched an air strike armed with thermonuclear weapons...and it could not be recalled?\\" However, they offer quite different answers. Credit Stanley Kramer's On the Beach (1959) with alerting the world to a possibility which seemed a probability when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed in October of 1962. In sharp contrast with Fail Safe which remains earnest but now seems somewhat stale and certainly dated, those who see Dr. Strangelove still savor the genius of Peter Sellers as he plays three major characters (President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake), joined by a surprisingly hilarious George C. Scott (General Buck Turgison) and Sterling Hayden (as psychotic General Jack D. Ripper, self-appointed defender of his nation's precious body fluids). They and other cast members create one memorable comic moment after another. The film concludes as Slim Pickens' Major T.J. (\\"King\\") Kong prepares to engage in what he calls \\"Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!\\" Few other film comedies have held up this well, especially after almost four decades. One final point. I am so appreciative of the DVD format which, of course, offers clearer sound and image but also of supplementary mnaterial such as the featurette: \\"The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove\\" and the documentary: \\"Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove.\\"
B000002H97|4.0|While the black album is subpar compared to previous Metallica material, concidering the fact that it was purposedly made for the mainstream [highly produced, short, simple songs and themes], it is still a solid album all on its own. <br />Enter Sandman (8.5/10) [the big single, possibly their best-known song] is a really good track for a while, but it can sorta make you sick to your stomach. Sad but True (8.5/10) is a rather solid track, adapted from a film, awesome lyrics, nice overall. Holier than Thou (7.5/10) is a fast, thrashy hard-hitter. The Unforgiven (9.5/10) is one of the finest songs on the album, hell, Metallica's Entire Career, deep, introspective, awesome. Wherever I May Roam (10/10) is easily my fave out of the album, love the lyrics, the chorus, vocal harmonies, very cool. Dont Tread On Me(8.5)  is pretty nice, through the never (7.5/10) is slightly mediocre. Nothing Else Matters (9/10) may not sound much like metallica, but its great anyway, one of the better power ballads ever cut. Of Wolf and Man (8/10) is alright thrash. The God That Failed (9/10) has good lyrics and the music rocks, written by Hetfield after his mother died. My Friend Misery (7/10) Doesnt catch my attention and the struggle within (8/10) finishes the sorta lacklusterly.<br />The album sorta sputters to the end, but still, its got really good momentum and its moments near the end. Maybe not a MUST-HAVE but certainly the last Original and Good album Metallica made.
B00006IU73|5.0|I was going to that concert to see &quot;Porcupine tree&quot; live because they're just too good.   Was I not surprise to see that they were only doing the first part of concert???<br />&quot;Opeth&quot; was the attraction of the night.  &quot;Opeth&quot; a boring death metal band on which we almost fall asleep.  On sevens songs we heard from &quot;Opeth&quot;, none of them were really death metal (get an album of Lacrimas profundere instead).  The singer talks more about himself than he sings. Easy stupid guitar on most of the songs.<br />On the other side, humble &quot;Porcupine tree&quot; made a great performance.  Has nothing to do with death metal. Their music is a lot more complex.  I was just sad they didn't do two good songs. The philosophical &quot;3&quot; and &quot;Lips of ashes&quot;. <br />I was the only one singing along when they played  &quot;Heartattack in a lay by&quot; and &quot;Trains&quot;.  Was I the only one to know all the lyrics of such beautiful songs.  My two favorites.  <br />&quot;Gravity eyelids&quot; kind of make me think of Talk Talk &quot;Laughing stock&quot; era.<br />&quot;Wedding nail&quot; a beatiful instrumental song with nice electric guitar.<br />Thanks to the clerk at the music store who made me discover that band last fall
0385504209|1.0|Christianity is a con job that for 2000 years has obscured the Real Truth--that of the Goddess--under a layer of patriarchal oppression.  That's what I ultimately took from this book.<br />The story starts out gripping and fascinating -- a murder in the Louvre, a cryptic series of messages, a chase. There are hidden codes in works of art, and explosive secrets that tantalize the reader to read on.<br />But the book founders when Brown devotes chunk after chunk to sermonizing under the guise of teaching.  Sophie, the primary female character, is a cryptologist who initially shows great intelligence as she helps our hero (Robert Langdon) escape, but for the rest of the book she serves primarily only as a receptive pupil for the nuggets of wisdom and knowledge she receives from the other primary (male) characters.  The pages devoted to delivering this information are tediously extensive. It's a device typically deployed in desperation when the writer can't think of a more skillful way to get his points across. In this case, it serves to bog down the story and try the patience of the reader.<br />What's more, the information is a real-life mishmash of fact, speculation, theory, and myth, all couched as Truth.  Brown himself states in interviews that aside from the story line, everything in the book is factual.  This is nonsense, but it accounts for the book's preachy tone.  Brown has an axe to grind, and grind it he does.<br />Finally, character development is nonexistant, as is typical in books that exist primarily to preach (for other examples, see the horrible &quot;Left Behind&quot; blockbusters or anything by Ayn Rand).<br />I say if you're looking for a masterful telling of this kind of story, head for Umberto Eco instead and leave Dan Brown behind.  Far behind.
6301095294|1.0|I must say I loved The Beatles in \\"Help!\\" & \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", & I just got this movie from the library today.  It's terrible...there's no plot.  The music was alright; it seems like every movie they made Ringo seems to be the center of attention, (nothing wrong with that). George only has a couple of lines in the movie (I should say words), which is weird.  There were a few slightly funny scenes in the movie.  Like when John was with the little kid on the bus, & when the man was singing on stage with the stripper.  The spaghetti scene was nasty.  I wouldn't want to buy this movie; only if it's very cheap, just to have it for my up coming Beatles collection.  If anyone really wants to see this moive; I'd get it at the library first.  I'm sticking with \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" & \\"Help!\\"
6305603847|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't think it was that great. WATCH IT A SECOND TIME. You really get to appreciate it the second time around. I think that the first time everyone sees it, they're expecting great animation and The Wall played straight through (at least that's what I was expecting). Its completely different, and you pay more attention to the plot than focusing on &quot;When's the next cartoon.&quot; It's just my opinion though, and you're bound to have yours. If you like Pink Floyd, this movies for you. If you like bands of the same genre, give it a try. If you like rap, I laugh at you. (JK) ...but this films not for you. Really a five star film.
B000001FZK|5.0|After a listening break of a couple of years (5 or 6), I finally put in back in my cd player and find their music really up to date now, not experimental anymore.<br />I don't really like the music on song &quot;Myrrhman&quot; too slow, too minimalist BUT Mark Hollis voice is so beautiful that it makes me forget it.<br />On the other side, I enjoy every single notes on song &quot;Ascension day&quot;, everything is at the right place (instruments used - singing).  It is just slow or entangled when it's needed. <br />&quot;After the flood&quot; makes me think of &quot;Breathe&quot; by &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; probably because of effects at the begining.<br />&quot;Taphead&quot; is a dark and gloomy song.  Starts in a slow lament then  moves in some kind of gravity (seriousness) and moves to a liberation.  Fabulous!  The cheerful &quot;New grass&quot; can only be highly appreciated.  Set at the right place on the album.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Ah...what a beautiful film. Completely manic and semi-idiotic, but beautiful in it's own strange way. Sam Raimi, who is an awesome director (check out Spider-Man if you need proof), certainly did a fine job with this little gem. The sometimes horrible special effects just make this movie even more lovable. And the one-liners! Glorious! Unfortunately for me, the Boomstick Edition, which apparently has both the director's cut (aka Bootleg Edition version) and the original, came out shortly after I got this version. *sigh, looks like it's off to the nearest Sam Goody for me. Anyway, this version still rocks, so I'd recommend it if only for the case and the look of the DVD, great touch.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This album was another critical and commercial triumph for Van Halen, a feat that is hardly surprising given the strength of material on offer. Even though they endured a slight (very slight) dip in quality with 'Women and Children First' their third album, this record sees the band blaze into the 80's with their reputaion intact. Not only that,'Fair Warning' is something of a departure from the sound they had honed to perfection over the course of three albums (in fact, they had it perfected from track one on album one, but such is the extent of greatness). Eddie's love affair with synthesizers, which was to assume, as we all know, mammoth proportions in a couple of albums time, first rears its head here, on the spacey and rather manic instrumental 'Sunday Afternoon in the park'. Not only that, the album has some tracks that are legitimately funk-driven, with Michael Anthony and Alex Van Halen slinging out loose, groove based beats like they were born to it.<br />Rest assured though, as this album has more than its fair share of the bombastic, ultra catchy yet remarkably technically proficient rock Van Halen excel at delivering. 'Unchained' is one of their finest songs, a heavy and hooky riff giving way to the most exuberant of choruses, and some of David Lee Roth's trademark cat calls and ramblings. 'So This is Love?' is funky and perfect, with yet another classic guitar solo tagged on at the end. 'One Foot Out the door' is the albums hidden gem, a synthesizer led, almost gloomy number that sounds like nothing they had recorded before, or ever would again. 'Push Comes to Shove' and 'Hear About it later' are mellower, although still groove based, with Lee Roth's vocals sounding better than ever before. Meanwhile, 'Mean Streets' and 'Sinners Swing' provide all the ludicrous excess we would expect.<br />This album consolidates Van Halen's run of impressively consistent form on every release, whilst treading new ground which is very welcome, proving they are capable of so much more than many had them down for. Sadly things would take a turn for the worse on 'Diver Down' but this record remains one of the finest and most original outings from a band who never ceased to deliver the goods in spectacular fashion.<br />Highly recommended.much more than many had them down for.

0446677450|5.0|This is one of the few works which teaches people how to build<br />and preserve wealth. The author distinguishes passive income<br />vehicles from the straight salary form of compensation which<br />tends to keep people from building wealth and personal<br />equity. In addition, the work specifies how to take advantage<br />of real estate in order to develop multiple streams of income.<br />This work should be required reading for anyone developing a<br />personal financial plan for the future.
B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes create an odd genre of music. It's best described as 'raw', because it's the basics - unsullied by electronic loops and samples and keyboards and synthesisers. It's pure, instrumental blues/indie/rock noise.<BR>    The songs sound a bit half-finished, like Jack and Meg are halfway through a jaming session, but this isn't a bad thing. In fact it makes them better. The songs feel like instrumental live versions of bigger, more complete ones. But this is not a bad thing, and nearly all the songs on here are worth the money (except Cold Cold Night. I could have done without that).<BR>    Buy Elephant.

B00008GKEG|5.0|This set is complete and tells you everything a real Beatles fan would want to know about the Beatles.  It goes through the entire history, guided by Paul, Ringo, George Martin, and others, and has many interesting storys on the way.  The footage that is also on these Dvds is phenomenal!
B00005JLXE|2.0|Another Marvel Comics character makes it to the screen. DAREDEVIL is co-produced by creator Stan Lee, which raises the viewer's expectations. This isn't the first movie to feature the character: Daredevil was previously played by Rex Smith (from the short lived TV series STREET HAWK) in the 1991 TVM, TRIAL OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK.<BR>Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck, who is trying to play Matt Murdock: a lawyer, and former Hell's Kitchen resident blinded at age 12 by toxic waste (that happens to fall off a fork-lift) after witnessing  the death of his prize fighter father Jack \\"The Devil\\" Murdock (David Keith) at the hands of thugs (phew!).<BR>As always happens in comic books, this toxic waste may have deprived Matt of his sight; but has heightened his four remaining senses. So of course Matt does what has to be done: He dons a silly costume and becomes a vigilante fighting for the rights of the little people and keeping the city safe from crime. <BR>But Matt/Daredevil appears to have met his match when he crosses paths with Wilson Fisk, a.k.a crime boss The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, who gained 18kgs for the role) and his henchman, Bullseye (A shaven headed Colin Farrell with a bullseye tattooed on his forehead, hence the name).<BR>However, Daredevil gains an ally in the karate kicking superbabe Elektra Nachios (ALIAS's Jennifer Garner), daughter of multi-millionaire Nicholas Nachios and together they join forces to try and topple the Kingpin (After she nearly beats the heck out of him, in an admittedly good fight scene). But tailing Matt is tabloid newsman Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) who is trying to uncover the truth about the urban legend of Daredevil. A weak attempt at adding a subplot.<BR>DAREDEVIL steals elements of BATMAN & THE HULK TV show; and when you combine this with a cliched script and a wooden lead, it all adds up to 100+ minutes of wannabe- hip; two- dimensional Hollywood drivel.<BR>Good production design is one of DAREDEVIL's few redeeming features; but the movies \\"Special Effects\\" include a camera tilt of Daredevil's feet splashing in a puddle! What a suspense builder! Even BLOOD FEAST (1963) had visuals superior to this!<BR>Also, check out this brilliant dialogue exchange when hero and villain finally meet face to face:<BR>Kingpin: \\"Daredevil!\\"<BR>Daredevil: \\"KINGPIN!!\\".<BR>Wow.<BR>DVD extras include both audio AND text commentaries by the producer and director, and an \\"Enhanced viewing mode\\" function with a Behind The Scenes featurette narrated by the Visual Effects Supervisor , as well as popup factoids you can watch during the movie. That is, if you're still interested. Bring on SPIDER-MAN 2, I say.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This set of 5 Dvds has everthing that a real Beatles fan would want to know.   The Dvds go through the entire story of the Beatles very thoroughly, guided by Paul, Ringo, George Martin, and others involved with them.  There is an amazing amount of extra footage that  you would never see otherwise.  Also, throughout the set the Beatles tell stories that are interesting and amazing.  This is by far the best collection of the Beatles work put onto a tape.
0679721037|5.0|Hiroshima dutifully records the prelude and aftermath of the world's first atomic bomb attack, capturing not only the stories and perceptions of the five individuals interviewed after the attack but also the details of how both the people and the city were transformed by the bomb.  The accounts of the effects of radiation and nuclear weapons were groundbreaking when they were published, as concepts such as radiation sickness were new to most of the world.  This book is essential for understanding the history of warfare.
B000089RVX|5.0|Imagine if you will angelic vocals painted on a tapestry of demonic music. This is the core of Evanescence. Amy Lee's vocal performance on this CD is a true awakening and all praise goes out to the musical inspiration of Ben Moody. There is never a dull moment on the entire CD. The album contains all-- beautiful vocals, hard guitar, string arrangements, classical piano, techno and even a rap segment in one song. They blend the album beautifully together and create what almost tells a story in rock opera fashion. I can not even single out a favorite tune because with the greatness of this disc that would be impossible. Don't even begin to try to make comparisons to other bands because Evanescence has their own sound. To try to out due this ablbum with their sophomore effort the band will have their work cut out for them, but I think they will rise well to the challenge. If I was to single out three favorite tracks ( and I don't want to) I would say Bring Me To Life, Tourniquet and Whisper, but every single song on the disc has a place in my heart. FALLEN would have to rate in my Top 10 favorite albums of all time. This disc leaves you begging for more and I eagerly await the band's next opus. This album will be a true classic. Evanescence-FALLEN easily gets my vote for 2003 ALBUM OF THE YEAR.
0553381695|5.0|For anyone to understand and appreciate this literary masterpiece you first have to read A Game of Thrones, Book one of the Song of Ice and Fire series.  In his second installment, A Clash of Kings, Martin sets the stage for an epic struggle of a land in utter chaos.  Five people vie to become king of the Seven Lands.  Death, deceit, and betrayal are all major characters in this epic novel which will have you up all night and into the dawn reading until you are finished.  Every sentence is carefully crafted painting a vivid picture of a place both real and surreal.  One of the most intriguing aspects about the book is that the chapters are told from character point of views, so one learns to sympathize with all the characters regardless if they are villians or not.  There are so many characters you'll love to hate and many more you'll hate to love.  Martin has created an epic story which transcends the likes of Tolkien and pushes the envelope in fantasy literature.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is not the type of movie I usually like, but I have to say that I was just pulled in by it. It gave me something to smile about, with it's colorful characters, and don't forget the Chocolat!!!  Juliette Binoche was the perfect choice for the role of Vianne, and of course Johnny Depp plays his sexy river rat role, to a T.  Judy Dench as Armonde, is just the perfect touch as the former wild child growing old...and still wild at heart.<BR>If you want to see a movie that leaves you feeling good, see this one!

B00008G68W|5.0|I actually own this unofficial DVD release of Ridley Scott's historical masterpiece, 1492: Conquest Of Paradise. The movie itself is a great film, with all you could ask for from any above average historical movie. Depardieu is very convincing as Columbus if you can get by him being French and all. He does a beautiful job with the part, bringing Columbus to life and it totally makes for an excellent character study, his character fascinates the viewer. The score by Vangelis is top notch, and it fits in well with the film. The music actually enhances many of the films key scenes effectiveness. It makes those scenes seem more meaningful because of Vangelis score. Now onto Ridley Scott, this is some of his best work. Now let me discuss this DVD, which was originally on the market overseas (in Korea or Hong Kong). This DVD is bad, the picture quality, why bearable to a degree, is awful and is below the quality of even laserdisc. The transfer is not nearly as bad as the audio presentation. The audio is horrible, and sounds muffled at times. If you can't wait for a possible SE release soon by Paramount, don't go with this, just wait for them to release it. Yes, this DVD is that bad. Buy the Widescreen VHS version instead.
B000002UR7|5.0|If you're into the morose and depressing songs that were made famouse by the likes of Cobain and Vedder, then this is the perfect album.  Yorke paints a dark world with his debut album, and I have to say that I loved it.  Seriously, you should get this album simply for the song 'Creep.'  Such writing has not been seen outside of Radiohead for a long time.  It's vivid immagry grabs you and connects you with those who feel out of place in our candy-coated society.  When listening to 'Creep' and other songs on this album, you can't help but feel that there's more of you out there.  I highly recommend this song, and I highly recommend this album.
0385509456|5.0|It's worth reading this book to spend time in Christopher's head. Apsberger's Syndrome provides a patina of emotional coolness that is constantly tested by circumstance. The tension between the two provides enough &quot;suspense&quot; to hold the reader's interest for the brief length of the book. The mystery at the heart of Haddon's wonderful novel is not a whodunit -- that one is pretty obvious long before it's solved at the book's midpoint. What sustain the reader are bigger mysteries: What is love? Who am I? How can I be safe? Christopher's wiring may be unconventional, but his observations are clear and his needs are so familiar that one reads in hope of understanding more about what life is. At the very least, I know more about the inner life of this mysterious boy. I hope it will help me relate to other people with more sensitivity and clearer perception. Since reading it, I've had several encounters where thinking of the other as Christopher has enabled me to express myself more clearly and directly. As a reader, I was merely bemused by his preference for some patterns and his rejection of others. It seemed perfectly natural. Applying that same coolness to people I love is much more difficult, but I'm convinced that it's a good idea. For two hours or so, I was a more compassionate person thanks to Mark Haddon. It's an experience I recommend.
0140177396|3.0|This book by john steinbeck was really well written. The characters in the book are very realistic and likeable, I specially like Lennie who I supose is authistic and George who is his friend who tries to help Lennie. I have 2complaints against this book is that I hated the ending maybe some people liked the ending but im not one who likes sad endings. 2nd I thought it was too short it should have been a little bit longer.
0671015206|4.0|I found this a very interesting book..lots of neat information in it, and those of us who aspire to be millionaires could learn alot from it. Those of us just interested in knowing more about social life in the US could also learn from it.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is a wonderful version of the Cinderella story. Drew Barrymore plays the role of Danielle (Cinderella), Dougray Scott plays the Prince Henry, and Angelica Huston plays the wicked stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent. The cast couldn't have been better! Especially Angelica who adds more &quot;evil&quot; to her character with the lifts of her eyebrows (trust me, it makes all the difference :] ) <br />Instead of the original mice, her fellow servants are her friends, and Leonardo de Vinci is her &quot;fairy godmother&quot;.<br />Her gown was gorgeous and the location was awesome. The accents were a bit bumpy, but everything else was great!<br />The fable was told differently in this movie and Andy Tennant did a good job directing the film. It's an awesome movie! Watch it and see for yourself!
B00006LLNU|3.0|This album is interesting. There is no denying that. However, I find that it is boring after several listens. Many of the rhythms come off as similar, and the songs have very little movement. perhaps I just don;t get this album. I would recomend godspeed you black emperor or do make say think. they are much more interesting and varried, for me anyway.

B00005NRO3|3.0|Funny how the sequel rules say more blood and gore, though we see less of it. The body count is bigger, but the victims go too easily. If you're going to bother doing something, do it right. This film still manages to be well-made with a bunch of great performances by a talented cast, fast-paced editing, and director Craven's horror sensibilities.<br />Less intense than the original, with less insight into the motives of the mind of a killer. But the film makes up for these obvious short-comings with lots of slick action sequences. The opening is the best scene encompassing the remaining horror elements from the original. But, this separates itself with a more universal score which I prefer to the first Scream, that has more contemporary ups and downs than just roundabout classic quirks. The soundtrack dumps the electronic outfits Julee Cruise and Sister Machine Gun from Scream, and attracts more mainstream bands like Foo Fighters, Tonic, Everclear, and Sugar Ray. Though the more impressive tunes come from Master P and Kottonmouth Kings. <br />The DVD includes those two music videos. But I wouldn't go about giving that my highest recommendations. The audio commentary is okay but not as dynamic as the people on it, the TV spots are too alike one another, the trailer isn't in widescreen, the featurette provides no interesting information about the film, and the deleted scenes suck. The music videos and the hilarious outtakes (bloopers) are the only truly worthwhile features on the disc. But if you absolutely have to have any copy of this film, you have to have this widescreen DVD. It's the only exceptable version of the film itself.<br />3 out of 4 stars for the movie and a 2 out of 3 for the DVD.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this CD. And I'm shocked. I bought it with the knowledge that many people who like Jason Mraz also like Maroon5 (they toured together). So, I thought this band would just be another Guster (who rock, by the way). But, they aren't!! They are funky, groovy, jazzy and many times Adam sounds just like Stevie Wonder, if that's possible! :) I'm really impressed!! BUY THIS CD! I play it all the time- just put it on shuffle and go! Between this and Mraz's WFMRTC, I'm good to go :)
B000002LHX|4.0|Prince is viewed by people who r now n their teens but little kids n the 1980'z as some kind of 1-hit 1der with a high-pitched voice. Eye've heard some really negative things about him from clueless, tone-deaf kids. These critics, along with those who think Prince is strictly a soul singer or JUST a singer/songwriter can listen 2 the Batman soundtrack 2 get n touch with reality. Some people didn't even know Prince was a musician - a multi-instrumentalist, until eye told them. If u were 2 listen 2 the opening song or the 2nd or 3rd song from the Batman soundtrack &amp; hear a vocal contrast 2 Prince's trademark falsetto on songs such as Scandalouz, u would not only b surprised at his range, u would gain an appreciation 4 his songwriting. The Future &amp; Electric Chair r sophistic8ed lyrically. If u were unfamiliar with Prince's work &amp; heard Batdance u would c his vivid imagination &amp; brilliant story telling. A few of the songs sound old-fashioned now, but considering they r from 1989, they r timeless n their own way. It'z a 1der that Prince didn't have a hand n the writing of the screenplay of the motion picture Batman. U can't tell from listening 2 the soundtrack album which 1 came 1st. Of course the movie project was the reason 4 the album, but u could take several of the 9 songs making up the album, maybe 8 of them, excluding Batdance, &amp; put them on other Prince albums &amp; they aren't out of place, which means thoughtful songwriting, not xpecting the movie 2 carry the album. 2 some degree, the soundtrack carries the movie. Rather than go in-depth with each song in review, a pleasant surprise awaits u...
B00005ATQI|4.0|The ominous bass chords of Wendy Carlos's keyboards accompany Jack Torrance's white VW Bug going down the highway, with Stanley Kubrick's aerial long shots soaring over lakes, mountains, and the forest.  An interview later, he is given a job to look after the Overlook hotel in Colorado during the off-season (October to 1 May).  However, as Mr. Ullman, the manager says, \\"The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is, uh, a tremendous sense of isolation. ... for some people, solitude and isolation can, of itself become a problem.\\"  He then relates the story of Delbert Grady, a former caretaker who went mad and murdered his family before taking his own life.  No problem, as Jack finds the seven months perfect to write his book while his wife Wendy and their son Danny can do other things.  However, Danny has a talent of recalling past occurrences through Tony, his imaginary friend.<br />The visual imagery is stunning and horrifying.  The one etched in my mind is the ocean of blood pouring out of the elevator doors.  And the Grady twins have got to be among the creepiest movie children I've seen in years.  It's quite a shock to Danny when they appear.  But the design of the hotel itself is a visual feast with its decorations, especially the Gold Room.<br />Stanley Kubrick's usual technique of long range camera shots achieving visual symmetry, e.g. hallway shots with Danny driving his Big Wheel as the center, with the rooms to the doors on either side, is ever present.  Another one is Jack looking at the schematic of the maze, which gradually turns into an aerial view of Wendy and Danny in the maze's center.  But the symmetry also represents the state of Jack's mind.  When he's sane, okay.  When he goes over the edge,...<br />Yet one criticism I have is the effectiveness of the captions indicating the elapsed time.  Despite the fact a month passed, I came away with the impression that Jack suddenly goes crazy instead of something that gradually happens.  It's more effective later on, but that initial transition could've been better handled.<br />And chalk up yet another role that deserved at least a Best Actor nomination for Jack Nicholson.  From the genial family man to a demon wracked by the murderous rage, his facial expressions.  A line from the MAD magazine's satire of this movie, The Shiner, is apropos.  Remember how he did one called One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest?... Well, he's still flying.  The well-famous still of his manically-grinning grizzled face framed against the door he's chopped away is one of cinema's indelible images.  And Shelley Duvall adds to the credibility as Wendy.  Her wide eyes effectively realizes the horror she feels as her husband tries to \\"correct her.\\"  A definite contrast to her Olive Oyl from Popeye, also released in 1980.  While Danny Lloyd does a credible job as Danny, he loses big in having a cheesy pudding bowl haircut that was big in the 1970's.<br />Kubrick was one of those directors who was not tied down to genre but explored different ones, be it sexual obsession (Lolita, Eyes Wide Shut), Cold War satire (Dr. Strangelove), science fiction (2001), near-future dystopias (Clockwork Orange), and the follies of war (Paths Of Glory, Full Metal Jacket).  With The Shining, he effectively added psychological horror to his small but potent resume.<br />Closing comments:  All review and no play make Daniel a dull reviewer.

0425098478|4.0|This book outlines precisely 3 principles: One Minute Goal Setting, One Minute Praises, One Minute Reprimands. People, like whales, pigeons, and dogs, will learn to achieve goals consistently when these principles are applied properly. <br />The tone of this book could be updated. The first few pages grated on me a bit, as the dialog seemed forced and contrived. The pagination is also odd, with some pages containing less than half as much text as others.<br />A good read to get some good basics before reading other management material.
B000055ZGY|5.0|And it does so many times in this movie.  A double-murder within the first ten minutes of a movie gets the pace going in what has been called the utmost in Mario Bava's ouvre of horror movies.  Minutes after Countess Federica is murdered by her husband Filippo Donati, he himself is killed by an unknown person and his body dragged away.<br />Many people then come down to the bay.  There's Albert and his wife Renata, the latter being Donati's daughter.  Frank Ventura is the scheming architect who wants to turn the bay and the area into some unspecified development project.  There are also some teenagers who arrive in a yellow dune buggy and carouse in the abandoned night club by the bay.  They are murdered most foully.  It is the scene involving these people that served as the guiding inspiration for the Friday The 13th series, you know, brainless teens getting chopped up.  But they are quick and brutal, or surprising in one case.  Brunhilda, a German girl who looks like Penny Irving (House of Whipcord, Are You Being Served?) has a nice nude swim and a shocking surprise before her demise.  She's actually one of the more decent of the four.<br />Of the residents, entomologist Paolo Fosatti, who is too involved in his Coleoptera (that's the taxonomic order of beetles, BTW)  than in his complaining, wine-bipping, fortune-telling wife Anna, and when she was alive, Countess Federica, are opposed to turning the bay \\"into a sea of cement,\\" the former for the insect life, the latter for its natural beauty and serenity.  Simon, the Countess's illegitimate son, hunts squid and lives by the bay.<br />This movie is also known as Bay Of Blood, Carnage, The Last House On The Left Part II, Ecology Of A Crime, Reazione a Catena, and Antefatto, so take your pick, but Twitch Of The Death Nerve is the official English title.  Whatever the title, this film sports a very high body count and brutal blood flow.  Despite the cover boasting it being the uncut version, running 84 minutes, I read in one of my film books that the running time was 90 minutes, so a discrepancy there.<br />The only face I recognized here was Claudine Auger (Renata), who played vivacious Domino in the Bond movie Thunderball.  Here though, there is not a shred of decency or compassion in this Lady Macbeth of a woman.  Mario Bava's stylish technique on lingering on victims and blood plays a large part here, as does Stelvio Cipriani's piano score, which resembles that of the Rachmaninoff-like love theme in his first movie, Black Sunday.<br />It's difficult to filter out the message of human greed and also that of preserving the environment.  Simon says it best:  \\"Man should live and let live and without any interference.\\"  When Fosatti points out that the squid he was eating was alive, Simon retorts, \\"At least I eat my squid.  I don't kill as a hobby like you do.  If you kill for killing's sake, you become a monster.\\"ad in one of my film books that the running time was 90 minutes, so a discrepancy there.  <br />The only face I recognized here was Claudine Auger (Renata), who played vivacious Domino in the Bond movie Thunderball.

B00006AUIG|5.0|I read one of the other reviews on this site, specifically the one that feels Session 9 sets back any realistic and modern view of the mentally disturbed.  I have to disagree with it completely.  Never at any time did I find myself left with the impression that \\"THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!!  FEAR THE MENTALLY DISTURBED!!!\\"  What I did get was, that sometimes, the bottom falls out of your life and how far you fall is the true depth of horror.<br />Mood and setting in this film are simply excellent.  I've seen comparisons to Blair Witch, but honestly BW had 5 good minutes of footage and a lot of unneeded dialouge.  Session 9 does not.  It is a slowly crafted masterpiece that evolves over the course of the film and takes you to some pretty dark places.  Honestly, I can't recommend this movie highly enough if you like your horror of the suspense variety and don't need buckets of gore to creep you out.
B000089RVX|5.0|&quot;Fallen&quot; is one of the best cds I have heard in a while! I heard &quot;Bring me to life&quot; and thought it was a good song, but i didnt buy the cd. Then one day I heard &quot;Going under&quot; and absolutely had to buy it! Going under is a powerful rock song, one of the best songs on Fallen. I also loved &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Imaginary&quot; for their beautiful, imaginative lyrics. &quot;Everybodys fool&quot; is a great song with a haunting melody. I think that this is a truly amazing cd!

B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah can certainly sing. DON'T KNOW WHY is one of the most delicately beautiful songs I've ever heard. The genius of that song, I'm afraid, had absolutely nothing to do with the instrumentals backing her wonderful voice.<br />The rest of the album is just as musically uninteresting. And without listening too hard to the songs, you could easily make the mistake of blocking out the instrumentals and only hearing her voice. An accapala album would have made more sense.<br />While just as mellow as Beck's SEA CHANGE, that album at least had beautiful music surrounding the lead singer's heartbroken lyrics and performance, courtesy of Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame.<br />Ultimately, everything sort of sounds the same, and boring, despite the talent of Jones.<br />Here's an idea, NJ, seek Nigel for your next album.
B00006F7IM|5.0|As a baseball lover, I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  It's the classic &quot;cinderella story&quot; of a worst-to-first team, with the twist that they were assembled because management thought that they would never be able to succeed.  While the ending is pure feel-good 80's comedy, the journey is well worth the effort.  Several scenes are absolute classic cinematic moments, and Bob Uecker's &quot;just a bit outside...&quot; will live forever in the lexicon of baseball junkies. <br />Despite the light tone of the movie, the acting is good for a comedy, featuring younger versions of Renee Russo, Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Dennis Haysbert, and Wesley Snipes, just to name a few.   I watch this movie every winter to remind me just what I love about baseball--that anything can happen.  A joy to watch over and over again, although the special features are a bit weak on the DVD--all you get are a grainy trailer and some talent files.  Then again, it seems that most of my 80's favorites get shortchanged when they go to DVD, so that's nothing new and different.  I guess the studios are only interested in spending time and effort on new release blockbusters.  Too bad, as this movie definitely deserves a Bull Durham-like re-release on DVD.
0375414053|4.0|Although the woman-trying-to-juggle-career-marriage-and-children is a somewhat overworked theme, Pearson's crisp and witty writing style give the plot of this story some freshness.  As a stay-at-home mom who formerly worked outside her home, I found plenty of situations and characters in this story that were not only funny, but rang all too true(especially the \\"muffia\\").  The reason that I rated this book with 4, instead of 5, stars is because it did go on a bit too long with a far-fetched ending.
0783235380|4.0|This is a really entertaining movie about two people who by fate are put together, they are completely different. One is a free spirit who lives by the codes of her own rules (Sarah, played by Sandra Bullock), and the other is a man who is about to get married and plays by the rules and basically fears change (Ben, played by Ben Affleck). Ben and Sarah are on a flight on its way to Savannah, but the plane has an accident. Ben is on his way to a wedding, and Sarah has to go to Savannah to claim $25 grand by selling a donut shops she owns. They hitch a ride in a rental car with a guy named Vic who smokes pot, and they are later caught and held, eventually released. Other events occur, such as them hitcing a ride with a real estate bus, pretending to be married so they can find their way down to Savannah. She lies about them being married, and him being a doctor. Of course they spar heads a few times, he is uneasy with her carefree attitude and she wants him to live a little more. Their lies catch up with them and put them in compromising positions, prompting Ben to strip in a gay bar for money to buy a car, so they can leave this town before they are arrested for fraud and not paying their motel bill. There's lots going on, and fate doesn't seem to be on their side. Ben takes this to mean he shouldn't get married, everyone gives him bad advice on marriage, and he is starting to doubt his intentions as well. We later find out Sarah is married and has a child from a previous marriage, who she had not seen in 2 years. She wants to give him the money she is after, but we find out her child was taken away from her, which is basically a sore spot for her. In the end, when Ben thinks he is going to dump his bride, he makes it and decides to marry her in Hawaii...and Sarah is reunited with her son and seems to be on the road to reconciliation with him.<br />The movie was fun to watch, with all the twists and turns from nowhere, the road trip from hell basically. Bullock as usual is a strong addition to the cast and Affleck isn't too bad either. It's a fun romantic comedy most people will love if you are a fan of the genre.
B0000025CP|5.0|Stained Class was Judas Priest's 4th Studio Album and to my ears one of the greatest Metal albums of all time. Their least popular, but most influential 70's release. Here is a song by song:<br />Exciter - The first Thrash song I know of.....Double Bass. Screaming lyrics and great riff's... Like Painkiller but better, because it was more original at the time....I rate it a...............A+<br />White Heat Red Hot - Opens with a cool riff and has pretty catchy high pitched vocals...Overall this song is good but nothing that 25 years later sounds classic....On the other hand 25 years later its still enjoyable and Rob has some GREAT Screams at the end..so I give it a...............B<br />Better by you better then me....This song opens pretty cool....It has a little bit of a Disco feel to it, which makes it kid of funny now...but it has the slow parts that show how PRIEST used to experiment....I could be wrong, but I think this is the song that got PRIEST sued..In which case it was written by \\"SPooky Toooth\\"<br />Stained Class - This Song ROCKS!!!! The Tuniquite Turns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I'd type more but I am too busy rocking out!!!!!!!!!<br />One of the best songs in Priest catalogue......A+<br />Invaders - Opens with a guitar synth thing a little drumms an average drums / vocals thing...The song has  lyrics about an Alien invasion and a some decent vocal melody lines,..but overall is filler.....rated C+<br />Saints In Hell - Opens wiht one of the best Riff;s I have ever hear (GO>>>KK)......Rob sings so high that its hard to understand his lyrics until the chorus....There is a great high hat sound in the middle of the tune,,...but does anyone care 70yomore????n It's to me  one of the top METAL Songs of the 70'S!!!!!!!!!..............A<br />Savage -  A catchy song about British Soldiers  bringing their beliefs o Native people...B<br />Beyond The Realms of Death - This could be Priests...\\"Stairway\\"....Its about a gut who goes crazy and can't deal with the world anymore..<br />If you have evet seen the movie...\\"Birdie\\"....starring \\"Nicholas Cage\\" the sory line is oddley familiar.<br />Hero's End - This song is supposedly about Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison and about how much of a shame it is that great arists \\"DIE:\\"  to prove their worth.....Whatever this songn is about...IT rocks!!!!!!!!

B00004Z511|5.0|Kid A is not the result of overblown egos, destitute musical ambition, laziness, etc. Kid A is a masterpiece. Following on the heels of the amazing success of OK Computer- upon first listen the band might be completely unrecognizable to the casual Radiohead listener. If you liked OK Computer, there is a chance you will not like this CD upon first listen. Instead of hearing  slamming guitars and exquisite, but pointed, lyrics, you are left with instrumentation and experimentation- what is left is a sound much in the tradition of John Cage- a Beatles' influence seen in their music starting with Sgt. Pepper and culminating in Revolution 9 on the White Album by John Lennon. Radiohead builds one musical collage after another that each have their own character and depth- and what a depth it is. Kid A- a quasi-concept album about the first human clone (said to be already in existence according to the vision the band paints for the listener?) is an album before its time- much like the band itself, as anyone who has seen the band live can attest to.<br />A listen to the album on vinyl adds an amazing level of depth not heard on the CD- but the CD is great in itself.
B000002B7M|5.0|[This applies solely to the original remastered album as opposed to the recent \\"demastered\\" one.]<br />After Ozzy split from Black Sabbath, he was worried that he couldn't go on.  Thanks to his manager (and now-wife) Sharon, he pressed forward and recruited ex-Quiet Riot guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Bob Daisley, and drummer Lee Kerslake for his very first solo album, \\"Blizzard of Ozz.\\"  Arguably one of the most essential rock records in history, this deserves the full five stars I give it and many people only realize that from listening to its popular tracks.  Here's the lowdown:<br />I Don't Know - The very first Ozzy song I ever heard is indeed one of his best.  For some reason, the bass here gets me every time.  A great track from the Ozzman and an excellent way to kickstart the album.<br />Crazy Train - The song that made Ozzy a household name, Randy Rhoads truly shines in his maniacal guitarwork that perfectly blends with Ozzy's vocals.  Most people remember Ozzy for this song and for good reason.<br />Goodbye to Romance - This ballad is generally mixed among the fans; I personally enjoy it and it's one of my favorites to this day.  It has this nostalgia feel to it that I can't quite explain.  The keyboards at the end were a nice touch.<br />Dee - Randy shows off his dexterity here.  Any Ozzy fan MUST listen to this song just for his genius guitarwork.<br />Suicide Solution - This one brought Ozzy infamy as it was responsible for several suicides.  Despite the title, this song's about Ozzy's alcohol problems.  This one's pretty good, not one of my favorites, but still a good track (I guess I'm spoiled by the live version from \\"Tribute.\\").<br />Mr. Crowley - The keyboards perfectly start one of Ozzy's best tracks.  I think Ozzy's vocals hit their highest point on the album with this song.<br />No Bone Movies - Probably the weakest track.  It never really stood out for me.<br />Revelation (Mother Earth) - Near the end of the album and we get the album's best ballad!  Ozzy's vocals seem odd but they perfectly blend with Randy's classical guitar stylings.  Seems strange at first but comes across flawlessly.  BEST BALLAD ON THE ALBUM.<br />Steal Away (The Night) - My personal favorite from this album, Ozzy ends the album with a great rocker with an infectious chorus.  Some of Randy's best guitarwork is represented here.<br />Overall, this is a definite classic in the rock genre.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to any rock fan in general.  Even if you don't like Ozzy that much, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll like this one.  It's a milestone that will never be forgotten.  The Ozzman would followup in 1981 with \\"Diary of a Madman,\\" which would tragically end up being Randy's last album with him.allad!

B000002JNN|5.0|This is a very enjoyable recording.  I love the song MONEYTALKS, but this song is just one of many that just attack you.  All the songs are very aggressive and Brian Johnson just screaches his way through the songs like a cigarette toting demon.  Great stuff if you are looking for undistilled rock and roll.<br />songs that also stick in your head are 'Are You Ready For A Good Time' and 'Thunderstruck' also 'Got You By The Balls' but all songs are good and quality.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Finally the first of hopefully many bands that will propose an antidote for MTV slop. This is such a wonderful fusion of so many ideas. It bursts with the raw energy of punk but has the musical dexterity of progressive rock and is cooked up with elements of electronica and latin. Its like WOW!! Just because you can play your instrument doesnt make you boring or even worse, Rush. The kids at home playing three chord bubble gum punk should give this a shot and throw out the blink 182 and new found glory records. ATDI was a great band but to anyone with the ears to notice this so far superior. The music reveals new levels to you on each listen and is totally unpredictable. I would recommend this to anyone with adventurous tastes or those who are just plain tired of what is passing for music these days and want to hear something great!! These guys are amazing. I would love to personally thank them for this great musical treat. They obviousy care about what they are doing cause they could have easily went for the quick cash and settled on the formula that made ATDI so great. But not a chance. They said [fooey to ]the SYSTEM!! And they took it to the next level. Hats off. BUY THIS ALBUM!!
0743243153|5.0|The book opens with the words &quot;Life is difficult.&quot; Once you accept that, it becomes a lot easier!<br />But most of us don't accept that. We think if we do things the right way, or if other people would, then eventually life would become easier. Our material needs will be met, love will bloom forever, bad things won't happen to us, and life will unfold according to our individual needs and wishes.<br />Guess again. If you're constantly trying hard and finding life to be a major disappointment, you may find comfort and practical help in the reading and re-reading of this book.<br />Peck writes in an easy to read, easy to understand manner, writing of his life and that of many of his own patients. He begins with a section on Discipline; the next is on Love; then Growth and Religion; closing (how appropriately) with Grace.<br />When first I read this, in my mid-twenties, (living life in what one of my 'friends' called Life in the Breakdown Lane) the sections didn't look like they'd offer anything to help me. Discipline was something I wanted to act out against, not find solace in. The section on Love, I was disappointed to find, did NOT provide any instructions on how to find a knight on a white horse. Growth and Religion seemed some kind of a paradox to me, and I was sure that Grace was nothing more than a name I wished I had.<br />But within those Sections I have again and again(at different levels) found peace of mind through solutions that at first I didn't fully understand, but came to believe in -- for anyone looking for help in improving their lives, from a non-dogmatic, non-fundamentalist point of view, I'd strongly recommend this book.<br />Read it, learn from it, and just as happens to the bunny in the children's book, The Velveteen Rabbit, you'll find yourself becoming more alive, and more 'real.'<br />I'd also encourage the reading of Sheldon Kopp's &quot;If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him&quot; and (if you're looking for some comic relief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).ief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).
B000001FTA|4.0|No question about it, \\"Bad Reputation\\" is enjoyable. Thin Lizzy has a terrific sound and there are many great numbers on this record. Actually, I'm particularly impressed with the lyrics on this one; both `Soldier of Fortune' and Southbound' are excellent in that way, as are most of the others. To be killed without a cause is not that unusual either, as far as I'm concerned. The guitars are great and truly Thin Lizzy in flavour. <br />While not being the most loyal Thin Lizzy fan out there, I do recommend &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; without hesitation.
B000026OHN|5.0|i may be wrong, but i blame glenn gould with mucking up the bach playing tradition with ego and stunts ... the humming and singing along, really ... and with few exceptions (schiff for one) it seems the bach playing ever since has tried to be \\"vivid\\" -- showy, or blindingly fast, or dynamically contrasty, heck there are so many notes! but richter comes at these pieces in the russian tradition, which is to say the middle european kapelmeister tradition. to my jaded modern ears it's a delightful revelation.<br /><br />though some preludes are played quite fast, richter's tempos seem slightly on the slow side (by modern standards). but he is still able to link the voices together in continuous song across all registers. there is a remarkable quality of meditation and intense participation in these performances. the fugues are given an individual character, and unfold without mechanical repetition: the recurring themes are inflected differently as they reappear in different voices. the prelude textures are always clean and fluent. many of the interpretations seemed to me completely fresh. the famous C prelude from book 1, for example, can sometimes sound like a merry sewing machine or a happy milkmaid's guitar, but richter makes it seem to float to our ears from far away, soft and weightless -- an unexpectedly poignant effect.<br /><br />the pieces were recorded in 1970-73 on a boesendorfer piano, which sounds somewhat tubby in the acoustics of the room, but richter gets an excellent aural range through variations in touch and very sparing use of pedal. the acoustics never detract from the presence of the music or richter's remarkable playing. strongly recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Based on what friends had told me, I had high hopes for Band of Brothers. What I experienced when I watched it though was like nothing I would have imagined. You were with them, with EZ Company, every episode. The stories of the different men, and the different battles, got right into you. Most amazing was the fact that every account was true. Not based on a true story, but true.<br />My Grandpa, although not Airborne, fought behind enemy lines in WWII. Unfortunately, he passed away when I was very young, but one story about him has always stuck with me. He was having a nightmare one night, and my aunt, who was a child at the time, woke him up. He jumped, and grabbed her, not knowing where he was. After a second, he realized where he was, and what was going on. He told my aunt, &quot;Sweetie, never wake me up like that. I am fighting the war every time I close my eyes.&quot; Band of Brothers, and in particularly, the Battle of Bastogne, finally brought home the horrors he must have faced. That many young men, who are now our Grandfathers, and Great-Grandfathers, must have faced.<br />I believe that Stephen E. Ambrose, may he rest in peace, did the world a true favor in writing the story of these brave, young heroes, and I believe that Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks should be praised for bringing that story to so many homes. I highly recommend this series to anyone.

B0000959N0|4.0|Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet says, \\"All the stunts are done like in Hong Kong with concealed wires pulling the stars up as they do their high kung fu kicks. In real life, no true martial artist kicks high. The lower the better. However, in the movies where the bad guys are paid to fall down a la the script, the more fancy and stylish the moves, the better. Notwithstanding all that, I liked the movie. Colin Farrel is great as Bullseye, the lunatic killer who loves to throw lethal objects like Ninja Shaken and other such missiles at people. He is a totally different person from his character in The Recruit where he has a perpetual frown plus 5 o'clock stubble but looks much better. The scene where a young Daredevil puts an end to the school bullies really made my day. A super duper scene! I love too the scene in the plane where Bullseye kills the chatterbox old lady next to him. His weapon of choice, a humble peanut from those small packets the air hostess gives you with your martini. He really stops her inane and boring chatter with a single move.Personally, I really dislike people who talk too much. Jennifer Garner is very good. Muscular, craggy and curvaceous and, she is not beautiful in the classic sense, BUT has that sex appeal or 'je ne sais quoi' as the Frenchies say that most men find completely irresistable. She can kick my butt any time. Her martial arts moves are smooth although it is clear she has no background in the martial arts. The love scenes sizzle! There is a very obvious \\"chemical attraction\\" between the two lead actors and it shows. A Comic strip hero is brought to life as only Hollywood can do it, complete with computerized special effects. I could do with a cane like Daredevil's cane. It has as many weapons as James Bond's briefcase in \\"From Russia With Love\\". All hot blooded Daredevil fans must be wondering where they can get one just like it. The movie is so fast and SO exciting, don't see it if you want to sleep after the movie, you might dream of jumping up all over the place and beating up a few dozen baddies with your collapsible cane! The message is the same as in the \\"Death Wish\\" movies with Charles Bronson, namely, when the law fails, take matters in your own hands and just 'waste' the baddies. Simple and basic. Ah, if only life in the 21st Century were so simple. But there again, what about Iraq? Bush and Blair were real Daredevils there and they did one hell of a job! I'll vote for them anytime. Enjoy!\\"might dream of jumping up all over the place and beating up a few dozen baddies with your collapsible cane!

B00004W510|5.0|Every Single album made after 1969 should model it self after this album. From the very first song of hearing Richard Manuel's solo voice we know will just be blown away and hear something different then what we heard on Music From Big Pink and other albums we heard up until that point. You got so many that became live classics &quot;Across The Great Divide&quot;, &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot;, &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, and &quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot;. A Definate must for any music fan 10 out of 10.
B000088E6D|3.0|This disc was recommended to me by the owner of a small shop on Cape Cod, who played me the opening track (&quot;Fever&quot;) and had nothing but glowing things to say about the album.  And after hearing &quot;Fever,&quot; I really wanted to believe Buble was going to be the kind of jazz singer I'd follow enthusiastically.<br />This album, though, with the exception of a handful of shining moments, is a little flat for me.  Great arrangements, sure.  The song choice, however, really irks me.  Is he trying to color himself as a young jazz singer who didn't grow up on jazz, or simply trying to toss out a diverse first offering to gain favor with the widest possible audience?<br />Those who have said anything along the lines of &quot;move over Harry Connick, Jr.&quot; are sadly misled.  It's easy to get excited over the rich timbre of his voice, or his youth, or some other superficial aspect of the artist, because young jazz singers are exciting indeed--especially quality ones.  But Connick will not be replaced anytime soon by a Buble. (or a Cincotti)  Connick has a feel for jazz (not to mention an enviable talent for arranging and experience that dwarfs his age) that can't be imitated or approached by Buble's first offering.  <br />If you're looking for a legit jazz cat, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a young guy with a sweet voice and a fairly solid feel for the big band idiom, you could do much worse than Buble.  I really think his next disc could be stellar if he sticks closer to more standard jazz repertoire instead of muzak-ifying 70's rock tunes.  <br />That said, I'm unabashedly addicted to &quot;Fever.&quot;  It's so damn catchy.
0440224764|4.0|The partner, so far, has been my least favorite Grisham book. Mostly because I found the hero, Patrick, to be insufferable for two reasons: #1, he's a thief, and #2, he is quite smug.<br />On Patrick's stealing: I guess, I have difficulty in sympathizing with a hero who steals regardless of whether the money is dirty or not. Patrick did not need the money, he was rich. He could buy whatever he wanted. Frankly, I felt he got what he deserved, when he got caught and tortured by the thugs in Brazil. I mean please, what did he expect them to do when they caught up with him? Give him a group hug?<br />Second, his attitude. SMUG .  Not only is Patrick smug, he's smarter than the police, the FBI, his former attorneys, and everyone else! Patrick manipulates everyone: his girlfriend, the doctor, the judge, his attorney. While these traits are supposed to be 'admirable' and 'intelligent' instead I found them tiresome. Patrick is a user.<br />While I enjoyed the book, I felt Patrick was very irritating. Maybe with a more sympathetic character, this book would truly shine.
B000089RVX|5.0|This has go to be one of the best CDs I have ever listened to.  Not only is the music itself great, Amy Lee's voice has a beautiful, ethereal quality to it.  The lyrics ,ay be the best part in my opinion...they are dark and poetic, and extremely thought-provoking.  Although they tend to keep up a rather gothic appearance, this CD is not what I would call goth, so don't let that worry some of you.  Although the lyrics are deep and dark, they aren't creepy or scary or anything like that.  I absolutely LOVE all the songs on this CD, although &quot;Whisper&quot; is probably my favorite.
0792844793|1.0|Yes, David Lynch has definetelly got a great talent in making dark weird movies, that require a lots of thinking to exersise your brains. But was the plot of the movie about a young man who becomes an amateur detective and how he satisfies his curiosity or rather about what lies beneath a quiet town society which cannot be discovered unless a young man gets curious or rather there is a deep message that the police is not capable of solving a murder mystery and a young man can and so on. I'm really confused, I cannot figure out!!!! Maybe I did not understand this film at all. But was there a meaning anyway???
B00008NG5V|5.0|Before I bought this CD, I'd almost completely lost my enthusiasm for new music.  I was firmly stuck in the early days of rock listening to Zeppelin, The Stones, The Doors, CSN, among the other greats, and happy to do so.<br />So much of the current \\"noise\\" out there, in my humble opinion, is absolutely void of talent.  The record industry has slowly been losing my dollars for years.  If I never hear about another boy band or \\"mouseketeer\\" making it big in the music industry, it will be a sweet day for sure.  American Idol......please.<br />I heard about Jack Johnson on CNN, of all places.  I went to Amazon and listened to a couple tracks and promptly purchased both his CDs.  I eagerly await his next offering.<br />His blend of groove, spirit, and provocative lyrics takes me on a journey every time I listen.  I usually wind up gleaning some subtle nuance to his songs that lingers with me throughout the day.  His music makes me think while I groove and, for me, that's why I listen to music.  He's socially conscious, sensitive, and probably a very cool individual in person.<br />Buy both his CDs, plop them in the CD player, hit \\"replay,\\" invite some friends over, and watch the mood mellow to create a memorable evening.  You could listen to his music on and on...
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is a departure from their previous work.  \\"Say You Will\\" has some harder rock sounds on some of their tracks rather than the overall pop/rock sound that they're known for.  A couple of those have some garage rock touches.  This makes a brilliant update of their style, even without Christine McVie.  However, they have some amazing guest musicians.  Sheryl Crow performs some keyboard parts in place of McVie.  Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks prove on this album that they continue to evolve with their songwriting and performing.  Nicks's lead vocals give the songs the emotion so deep that one can feel it in their hearts.  Buckingham's have that unique emotion that one cannot easily explain.<br />     It doesn't quite reach the quality of \\"Rumours\\", and it has a few weak spots.  However, it's still very entertaining for any new and long-time Fleetwood Mac fan.  They make a triumphant return to the music scene after a six-year absensce.  With an album like this, hopefully they don't leave the music scene again.
078322608X|5.0|Whoever selected the cast for this picture deserves an honor.  There are probably fifty other actors who could have played the confused yet convincing Cole, at least a hundred who could have played the part of the endearing, made psycho and at least a thousand who could have played the female psychiatrist.  But the selection of Willis, Pitt and Stowe was a stroke of genius.<br />It is difficult to imagine anyway EXCEPT Willis in the role with his befuddlement, drive and raw emotions.  And Stowe's slowly evolving awareness of something impossible to believe was a sight to behold.  But it was the dark story line that carried the movie.  This film is a mystery with a little science fiction thrown in for fun.  What makes it so alluring is the absence of blatant &quot;here it is&quot; storytelling.  Lots of inferences and off the screen suppositions. <br />Several scenes stand out - the shot of the NY Library, the inquisition before the panel, the final, desperate lunge and sudden remembrance...the whole effect was chilling. A perfect film noire.
B00000IP3S|5.0|I first stumbled into the realm of BG's music through a file sharing service a while back. After listening to the title track and \\"Mordred's song\\" I decided to pick this album up at my nearest record store. This by far is one of the most original pieces of art to come of the otherwise stagnant genre known as Power metal. I don't like that much power metal (due to it's tired formulas), but this band has always been easily recognizable. The lyrics, vocals, bass, drums, and of course guitars are light years ahead of their utterly forgetable contemporaries. Hansi is a unique vocalist who manages to break away from the typical operatic style of singing used by most Power metal singers. After much consideration I have found this album to be my favorite BG release. This band will truly stand the test of time. So just pop this one in your CD player, whip out yout favorite Tolkien book, and enjoy yourself!
6305313687|4.0|Well, if you look at any of my other recommendations, you can tell that I believe that Ed Norton is one of the best actors today. His performance in American History X is no different. Norton continues to avoid the character molds that so many actors fall into.<br />Norton, a dangerous skinhead in the first half of the movie, sheds light on the violence and hatred of certain separatist groups. His violent acts culminate in a very violent murder of a young African American male. The movie then follows Derek Vinyard (Norton) to jail revealing the stress that he feels dealing with the other in-mates. Released from jail, Derek Vinyard tries very hard to lead a new life while at the same time finds out how his past activities effected his younger brother.  One of the best storylines in this movie is the relationship between Norton and Edward Furlong.<br />The DVD's is high quality, however, there is nothing extra provided for the DVD fan. Even with the lack of extras, this is still one of Norton's best films and well worth the price.
B000084T18|1.0|Rap has dropped to another low. I'm from Australia and i havn't heard this 'so-called' rap played on the radio/television so much. Every second commercial promoting this albulm. This albulm has become Brittney Spears not rap. Whoever says this albulm is phat are not true fans but pop lovers. 50 cent mumbles rather than raps. He claims he's keeping it real, however this as commercial a rapper can get. Let the every day public adore this Bull**** real hip-hop fans buy Killan Priest - Black August instead.
6305127697|5.0|Since I have never really been a big fan of Richard Gere, I ignored this movie when it was in the theaters back in '96.  One night at the video store, I wanted a mystery/drama and thought &quot;what the heck, it cannot be that bad.&quot;  2 hours later, after watching it once, I wanted to watch it again.<br />Ed Norton delivers an amazing and very disturbing performance.  Although this was his first major movie, he created a character that one moment you feel for and the next ... well I will let you learn that from the movie.  Richard Gere is also very good in this movie.  He sheds light on the good and bad side of defending the accused.  The movie takes you step by step through his investigation and you understand why his character believes in Norton's character so much.  As a law student, the court room aspect of the movie is a little weak, overall it is the best legal thriller avaliable.
B00005RY7X|4.0|My friends look at me with incredulity when I extol the virtues of Andrew Wilkes-Krier's debut album, 'I Get Wet'.  But it's true: this is driving hard rock the way it should be, with loud, fuzzed-out guitars, pumping keyboards, a bass lost in the mix, and NO complex lyrics to get in the way!  Andrew WK is in his mid-twenties, but you wouldn't know that from the primeval, testerone-laden outburts of masculinity and caveman-like self-assurance found in songs like 'Party Hard,' 'Party Til You Puke,' and 'The Girl Is Beautiful'.  These simple affirmations of the good life will definitely get you going.  AWK was classically trained and has a definite flair for the dramatic and the moving: the title track, 'I Get Wet', is a rousing call-to-arms to embrace whatever it is that brings one joy.  The album ends on a high note when AWK presses us all to not 'stop living in the red,' i.e. to never give up our passions.  I'm really looking forward to his next CD, The Wolf, due in September, but in the meantime I urge all of you to put aside your misconceptions and embrace one of Detroit's princes.
6305882592|5.0|this film is one of my all time favorite movies...it's (funky) 70's style fits the mood in this very cynical film....<br />Harold is a death obsessed young man who meets Maude at a funeral (very fitting) and wants to help him see the beauty of life and to teach him that life is precious and you should grab ahold of it while you have it instead of focusing on the death....through the course of the film Harold goes from hating life to loving it....<br /><br />It's one of the most conventional love stories ever made....a beautiful written and acted film....a must see....give it time if you don't like it the first time...it will grow on you....and Cat Steven's music for the film was outstanding....look for \\"Footsteps in the Dark\\" for most of the music in the film!!!
B00005JLK0|5.0|Reminds me of 'Shock Waves',but doesn't leave you feeling scared at the end of the movie. The ghost of the little girl talks way too much,the 'demon' at the end of the movie gives his whole life story,which in turn leaves you feeling more bored than scared. This movie reminds me of another movie about a female ghost who at the end of the movie spends like 20 minutes giving her whole life story on how she died,which leaves you bored after the first 2 minutes,same thing for this movie. I give this movie 5 stars because 95% of American movies now a days stink with lousy story plots,this 'director' at least gave it some effort,can't condemn him for that.

B00008OSD3|5.0|The thing that kills these movies or series is the lost of imagination on a wide scale. The first thing I notice gone are the 'mini skirts' for women,what happened there? The next thing is there are too many 'under' and 'over' aged people,in these movies and series,there should be a uniform age of 20 to 30 year olds only,what happened there? Another complaint is there are way to many 'aliens', 99.99% of these 'trek movies' should be more humaniod than alien w/ 1% vulcan,the vulcans should be portrayed as more of a 'high tech' and 'militarized' society defeated and occupied by the 'Federation'. The plots should circle around Roman,Greek,or medieval periods of earth history,not this jibberish of nothing plots. Trekers should be able to step on other planets mimicing early earth periods of ancient history,thats what made the early series a hit. And start using plastic model kits to form space ships that look real,not this 'cracker jack' computer graphics advocated by George Lucus.
B00004VXF2|1.0|Take Reed's name out of the cover: just noise. Period. Where's that wonderful joke everyone's praising about (for the humor persona)? Burn Velvet Underground albums (like someone claimed)?; waitaminute, I dig &quot;Sister Ray&quot; once in a while: more diverse, melodically gratifying, raunchy and FUNNY.<BR>This is dull for the sake of being dull. It reminds me of those Warhol art flicks that everyone raves about (but nobody can actually see nowadays): just a static frame of a building (Empire). Reed wanted to be as radical as his old tutor? Sure, whilst releasing a double album TO LIBERATE HIMSELF FROM HIS LABEL CONTRACT. (Talk about artistic integrity...)<BR>If one of the Backstreet Boys was about to release his own post-post-modern version of this Metal Machine Music concept (because this is conceptual art at its highest and most obnoxious: try to &quot;enjoy&quot; it without trying to find a reason for its existence), who would care? But since conceptual art is more precious for being a statement or the work of a particular autor rather than an organic entity in itself (the stupid vinyl should last forever, remember?), this rules! Nothing better than a quote from the man himself (not exact, but close): &quot;Anybody who makes it to side 3 is dumber than me.&quot;<BR>Zero stars.<BR>Save the money or give it to charity. Get a life.
B00005K3O4|5.0|...and that's what Mahoney said when he heard about the 'unreal' and unbelievable story of the klowns putting their victims in these 'cocoons'! I'm gonna tell you a story: when I was 4 years old I watched this movie and I scared myself a lot. I spent nights without sleeping and my fear for klowns was big as well. Even though I'd get scared when watching the movie, I'd put it on my VCR and watch it over and over again...because it was just an excellent movie. From then on it wasn't until 14 years later that when I found out that MGM had released the movie again I bought it. The movie has changed...not only it reminds me how perfect the movie is, but it reminds me the excellence of the movie's topic. Thank you MGM and Chiodo Bros...you've made one of the most amazing movies I've ever watched!<BR>By the way, remember: \\"Some will make you laugh, some will make you cry...but these killer klowns are gonna make you die!\\" (The Dickies).
B00008V2VM|5.0|I heard about this movie from a friend and watched it.  When I heard it was a low budget film, I didn't expect much.  The only reason I saw it in the beginning was because Christian Bale and Taye Diggs were in it.  When I saw the film, I was completely blown away.  The plot wasn't original, but it was definitely intriguing and quite good.  The actors' performances were astounding, especially Christian Bale's.  I really liked the \\"gun kata\\".  Really original and much better than the gun-action sequences in The Matrix.  I think it's ridiculous that some people think it's a ripoff of the Matrix.  The script was made before Matrix came out.  And to the people that wonder why Christian Bale's character was hard to kill, pay attention to the little detail with the lie detector, where Preston shut off his emotions and became a cold blooded killer.  It was a great film overall...the plot was good...the actors' performances were great...and the action was great.  No need for the bullet-time effects in Equilibrium...the action stands out all on it's own.
B00002Z88D|5.0|...Sure, S&M had it's skeptics.  Sure, people questioned, \\"How the hell are they going to pull that off?\\"  <BR>  I was rather excited about this performance when I first heard about it.  Of course, I didn't think it would be as good as it was.  When I picked up the CD, I read the songs and first questioned...\\"Where is 'Fade to Black'?\\"  ...\\"The Unforgiven I & II\\"?  These are three songs I thought would be on the album, but weren't.  So I was a little shaky, but I bought it anyway.  I got home and started listening to it.  The first song I listened to was \\"Master of Puppets\\" and it was brilliant.  As I started listening to the rest of the album, I was blown away by \\"Of Wolf and Man\\", which I think is one of the highlights on the album, as well as \\"Bleeding Me\\", and my personal favorite, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\".  The disc contains two newe songs, \\"No Leaf Clover\\" and \\"Minus Human\\", which are Metallica classics.  One song I enjoyed, but at first I thought they could have used \\"Fade to Black\\" or one of the <BR>\\"Unforgiven\\"'s to take it's place was \\"Devil's Dance\\".  I still enjoyed the song a lot and I'm they didn't take it off the album.  The orchestra shines through on songs like \\"Until it Sleeps\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\".  My favorite song on the album is \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" because the way the orchestra plays the riffs just perfect.  I really love this album, and the DVD is awesome too.  Heavy Metal and Classical Symphony diverge!
0446677450|4.0|This book was a success and I believe anyone can relate to it as long as they're not afraid to admit their financial struggles. I really enjoyed the book because it showed the differences between the rich and the middle class/poor. The author often repeats himself over and over again but he does it to prove his point and to make sure his point is understood. He not only explained the &quot;secrets&quot; of becoming a success with money but he also explained why the middle class and the poor are where they are now struggling. He doesn't look down on anyone, instead he points out the mistakes that the non-rich don't notice so that they know what they did wrong or where they're going wrong. His book was more of an inspiration and a lesson itself. I definitely give it two thumbs up!
B00004VXF2|1.0|So, for practical reasons, this is good for getting rid of people by torture.<BR>Guess this is music for the popular ones.
B00005JLYU|5.0|I'm sorry but everyone who gives it less than 5 stars is seriously out of there mind!!Me and my friends all loved it it's our favorite movie of all times and i dont see how anyone wouldnt like it.we use there helpfull tricks in everyday life.not only did we think the movie hillarious it very entertaining and full of action!we think that nobody could play the angels better.WE love you  Cameron,LUcy,and drew and we also enjoyed demi moore playing a fallen angel!!<BR>~lots of love from all of us
B00005JKPF|5.0|Okay..I'm sure I'm not the only one who emerged from the theatres after seeing the original 'X-Men' and immediately said,<br />\\"Bring on X-Men 2!!!\\" 3 years pass..we hear the rumors, we see the very few set pictures published in magazines, and we ultimately wonder just how better it's gonna be...<br />Well, friends..lemme tell ya..it's absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, AWESOME in every sense of the word! I saw 'X2' 3 times in its theatrical run and it all I can say is I was in Marvel heaven. Being a lifelong fan of the X-Men, I was not at all disappointed. I don't think there are a lot of people who were..what does that tell ya? :)<br />One thing about 'X2' that makes it far better than its predecessor is the fact that all characters and their mutant powers were already introduced and explained in the first movie. So that just opened the door for our favorite superheroes to let loose, kick butt, and take names. The story is deeper and darker and there are many themes that run through the movie that hit close to home.<br />There are subplots that are intrinsically (and perfectly) weaved into the film that provide the audience with loads of entertainment. There isn't a bland moment in all of the film. The opening action sequence with Nighcrawler in the White House is a damn good way to get you engaged and wanting more of that kind of action.<br />The acting was great! They all seemed to have been enjoying themselves (hey..gimme a chance to play a superhero and I'd be jazzed too!). As far as the coveted 'scene-stealing award', I would have to say that it's Wolverine's title.<br />Nightcrawler was definitely the break-out character, but Wolverine was just FAN-DOUBLE-TASTIC!!! We see him on many different levels: first as the loner who continues his search to find out who and why he is what he is, then we see a rather soft side of him as his feelings for Jean Grey begin to grow, and finally as the feral clawed Weapon X primally screaming down the halls of the X-Mansion and cutting loose with his trademark beserker rage. I absolutely LOVED watching Wolverine. My favorite comic character proving to all that he's the best there is. I don't want to give the rest away because that's the best part. Oh..and a little note to Hugh Jackman: Dude..you were BORN for Wolverine!!<br />Just trust me when I say that X2 is definitely worth every penny you spend on a ticket. Some even argue that this is the best comic-book adaptation ever. Well, hey..it got my vote.<br />Now I'm left saying over and over much like before...<br />BRING ON X3!!! :)nsion and cutting loose with his trademark beserker rage.

0880389052|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think about this book as I finished it, I had to think about it for a while, and here's my conclusion: Salvatore is a good writer, and yet, he doesn't have the talent of, say, Wise And Hickman, that capture you and make you into a part of the book, a book that is far beyond the D&amp;D world it's based of. Salvatore, so it seems, needs the frame of the D&amp;D world, and he sometimes sticks to it too much, and it is too clear that he does. The book doesn't let you enter, it's cold and faraway like the world it's describing. If made on purpose, it's pure literal geniusy, and I give Salvatore all the credit, if not made on purpose, well, it's still good. Yet, it makes this book harder to swallow.<BR>Maybe it's the transtlation, but sometimes the book seem to be stretching things too much, until it begins to bore, and sometimes there is some imaturity in Salvatore's writing that makes you almost role your eyes.<BR>However, the Characters are great, the plot is original and good, and beyond all the lacks in the structural-literal part of the book, you finish it and love it. There is something beyond the plot, the dialogues, the characters and the plane literal espect, that makes this book a great book. 5 stars, and worth each of them.
B00005T30L|5.0|\\"Ghost World\\" is a haunting look at a young high school graduate as she struggles to figure out what her next step in life should be.  Cynical, intelligent and artistic, Enid (Thora Birch) is an irresistible and endearing character.  Hating most of society and humanity that surrounds her, she embarks on a spiritual journey of sorts to find her niche in this crazy world.  Enid, who prides herself on her ironic sense of humor, lives with an emotionally inept and cowering single father and spends all of her time with her best friend of ten years, Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson).  It soon becomes clear that these two are, however, set on different paths, for while Becky actually has some direction in her life, Enid is lost in the clouds. Then, as a result of a prank pulled by the two girls, we meet Seymour (Steve Buscemi)- a cranky, super-cynical, anti-social hermit who has an unhealthy obsession with old-time records and hasn't had a date in 4 years.  Although on the surface they have nothing in common, their friendship blossoms beautifully as a result of discovering that they are indeed very much alike: they are both outsiders, loners.<BR>   The dialogue is witty and sarcastic, the mood is quirky and the characters are dead on.  Portrayed in this small American town are these hilarious stereotypical characters: the super-nice and annoying girl from high school, the wife-beater-wearing white trash guy, the foreign convenience store owner, the wacky and flaky art teacher.  As Enid comes into contact with this variety of characters, her reactions are priceless. <BR>   This story about a unique young woman who is trying to figure out what she wants in her world has universal appeal because it could happen in Anytown, USA. If you've ever felt like an outsider, or simply have gotten lost in the shuffle in this high-paced maddening world, this is a must-see.  Personally, it hits home for me, as I once felt like an Enid as well.
B000002BUY|5.0|I remember when I put this cd into my cd player and heard the opening song \\"Redefine\\" I knew this was going to be a band I liked for the rest of my life. Along with bands like Deftones,Korn,System Of A Down and Rage they truly show how you can be influenced by bands but not copy them. They take their influences throw them in a can and come out with something new. \\"Vitamin\\" shows something bands seem to have forgotten about rising action. The band can do anything they want. Whether it be a funk-driven love song (\\"Summer Romance\\"),or a healthy dose of alt-metal (\\"A Certain Shade Of Green\\") or a little bit of it all (\\"New Skin\\") they truly prove they aren't going anywhere. Singer Brandon Boyd's lyrics range anywhere from social politics (\\"Idiot Box\\"),to sex (\\"Nebula\\"),and even the dreaded dead end topic of being angry at your parents (\\"Favorite Things\\") but they tackle it very well. All in all this is a great buy. You will still be listening to this ten years from now.
B00006879E|5.0|I saw them perform in Arlington Texas at Six Flags over Texas just a couple months ago. And while the crowd had other opinions since it was a pretty strictly punk group. Maroon 5 still left a favorable lasting impression on my mind and the next day I went and bought their album and have been obsessed with it ever since. They really have there own unique sound in my opinion. And I love it!! They Rock!
B00005NW02|5.0|System Of A Down is one of those bands I have always been fascinated with. They just got everything! And they always leave you longing for more with each listen. To call System Nu-metal is childish like Deftones and Incubus they are a band that isn't in the genre they pioneer and define the genre and make it hard for any band in the genre to look any good or not look like they are trying too hard. It kicks of to an abrupt start with &quot;Prison Song&quot; and the rush doesn't end until about track nine where the ode to Charles Manson ballad &quot;ATWA&quot; kicks in where you can finally take a breath. Yes, sure the band is heavy but that doesn't stop them from churning out some of the most beautiful harmonies and heartfelt lyrics of any of today's bands. There isn't one bad song on this whole album and you never get tired of it with as many listens as possible. This album is timeless so please purchase it and don't burn it trust it will be in your collection for a very long time.
B00001ODGR|5.0|No matter what you think of Styx there's one thing you've got to admit: They always put on a great live show.<BR>This one is no exception. Taken from the last night of their &quot;reunion&quot; tour, it features songs from their entire carreer. All the guys are in great form, and newcomer Todd Sucherman displays some amazing chops behind the drumkit!<br />The main man of the evening is (as always), the mastermind behind Styx' awesome song writing and production: Dennis DeYoung. His voice just gets better with age!<br />I have seen &amp; heard quite a few live recordings with Styx, and I dare say that this is by far the best one.
B00004Z400|5.0|I have to say Deftones have been my favorite band for a very long time but even i wouldn't expect them to churn out something this excellent. This album singlehandely in my opinion showed that this band can do whatever the hell they want and all the other bands are going to have to work alot harder when they around, and this band isn't going anywhere. The band kicks in with &quot;Feiticeira&quot; and just let loose. Then what has to be one of my favorite songs ever &quot;Digital Bath&quot; the song is so beautiful and it just enthralls you into the sound and make you believe you are living the song and that is what i love about this band. They can play some of the most heaviest sonic blasts (&quot;Elite&quot;,&quot;Korea&quot;) but at the same time some truly beautiful music (&quot;Teenager&quot;,&quot;RX Queen&quot;). I think the other standout tracks have to be &quot;Knife Prty&quot; which is more reminscent of Jane's Addiction then Limp Bizkit (no offense to Fred and the boys), and &quot;Passenger&quot; which features the guest vocals of Maynard James Keenan of Tool/A Perfect Circle and aids the perfect amount of atmosphere to the track. This is something any fan of music should own (just excuse the first track)and if you don't own it already this is your wake up call.
B000056VJ7|5.0|This album has sold more than 35 million copies worldwide, and it continues to sell aproximatley 200.000 copies each year. There is a very simple reason to it's succes: It is one of the greatest albums of all time and of all genres! Do yourself a favor and buy this album. You'll never stop listening to it - no matter what age, gender, religious belief you may have. If one album can unite the world and bring us peace, it's this one... :)
B000005RU2|5.0|BUY....THIS....ALBUM....NOW!  The Remastered version is worth the price.  The album sounds better than ever but doesn't loose its original feel, and you get three extra encore tracks which are all up to par with the set proper.  This is one purchase you can't go wrong with and can't be without.  One listen and it'll find its way into you're music rotation.  You want to know what an awesome, breathtaking, transcendent rock concert sounds like?  Buy this and you'll wonder why you wasted all that money on the pathetic \\"rock\\" music of the past 10 years or so.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I read the book and adored it, so I was overjoyed to find the most recent film adaptation of Persuasion was nearly perfect in every way.  I couldn't imagine a better casting job.  The actors bring Jane Austen's characters to life in a way I can't visualize her disapproving, and the script is just as it should be.  I wonder about Mrs. Smith, and that issue of her husband's fortune in the West Indies, but other than that,the film is impeccable. The music sets beautiful tone for the romance taking place, and you couldn't wish for a better Anne or Wentworth.  Of course, you'll fall in love with every character in the film-if not for who they are, for how closely they resemble the characters in the novel. Enjoy!  I know I did.
0783227019|5.0|This movie centres around Carlito Brigante, an ex-con who wants out of the cycle of crime he's been in all of his life.  Everyone around him laughs at his dream of being part of a car dealership in the Bahamas with his ex-con friend, but he's determined to earn enough money to buy into this business  by saving the profits over time from the night club that he is running.  However, he can't seem to get away from the criminals that he used to be involved in, and the new crop of junior criminals who view him as a legend.  The worst of these criminals is his own lawyer, played by Sean Penn, who has no idea how things work in the street and yet keeps on pushing the envelope to get what he wants from the various hoodlums.<br />Pacino and Penn both play their roles brilliantly and the cinematography is equally deserving of praise and notice.<br />Go rent it!  It's a classic.
0385504209|5.0|Amazing story that is so well-researched! Brown is a fascinating writer who obviously put a lot of time into this piece. I was so excited to read this amazing book. After reading and got a book from the library of da Vinci's paintings and found exactly what Brown refers to! This book spans religion, history, literature, crypotography... it is just amazing. The writing is a not the greatest literary feat, but the story is worth 100 stars.<br />One of the best books I have ever read--makes you see the world a little differently after reading it! :)
B00005JKN9|2.0|Any time you notice someone acting, it's not necessarily a good thing! As I sat back watching Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York, I kept thinking to myself, \\"Wow, look at Daniel Day-Lewis do this,\\" and \\"look at Daniel Day-Lewis do that,\\" and \\"gosh, Daniel Day-Lewis has a lot of talent!\\" It suddenly dawned on me that I wasn't taking the chararacter of Bill the Butcher as seriously as I was DDL's skill as a performer. This to me is not perfect acting. If it had been, I wouldn't have noticed the \\"actor\\" at all. Don't get me wrong, DDL is still the most entertaining aspect of the film, but that's more a testiment to the film's failure rather than DDL's brilliance. I have loved Day-Lewis' past screen performances, but this one is best suited on stage where subtlety is not really a requirement. I never thought I'd live to witness a subtle, introspective Jack Nicholson (in About Schmidt) and a flamboyant, scenery-chewing Daniel Day-Lewis in the same year!
0452282152|5.0|I read another book, Girl in the Hyacinth Blue, recently and enjoyed it very much. It also concerned Vermeer, but from a much different standpoint. That book was more about his painting, this book was more about the man and his time period.<br />I really enjoyed the story of Griet, the daughter of a blind man, who must feed her family because of he father's trade accident. (The kiln exploded at his work, and blinded him leaving him without a way to support the family of 5) Griet is thrown into a maid position for a Catholic family (her family is Protestant) in the city of Delft, Holland. The household is full of children and she must serve two mistresses, but she finds herself much more intrigued and drawn to the master of the house, Johannes Vermeer.<br />The story tells of Griet's growing up, and her feelings for her master--she evantually sits for a painting that goes down in history as his most noted painting--a girl looking over her left shoulder, wearing a pearl earring.<br />It is a beautiful historical fiction, I could not put it down. Chevalier is a wonderful writer, and I really look forward to her other books!
B000000OU0|3.0|Personaly, I dont like live albums or cuts. The sound of the clapping and the whistles halfway through the song get to me. It reminds me of those DJ's who just have to get in their little advertisments before the actual singing begins, whether or not the intro is pretty. It drives me crazy! That said, this album is satisfactory. It is good background music, and the legendary performers themselves are of course wonderful. Even live, they sound perfectly harmonious throughout. Noone is offkey as far as I can tell at all. The music is slightly different from studio versions of course, but that is expected. I personally love \\"New York Minute\\" for the nice harmonies and unisons and the music, although it sounds ever so slightly like something from \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" at first. But it's still gorgeous. They have also included the famous quote \\"Just for the record, we never broke up...\\" you know the rest. I thought this was nice little addition for fans who might have attended the concert. It is at the beginning of \\"Tequila Sunrise\\". This is a good CD to get IF YOU LIKE LIVE ALBUMS!!!! I forgot to find out whether this one was when I got it, and I was sorely disappointed at first, until I got used to it. Don't do the same. Read up on your info before you buy!
B00008DDSC|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater, another one of those \\"art-house flix-that-my-boyfriend-has-dragged-me-to\\" is what I thought. LOL<br />Definitely not what I expected.. it starts off rather dark and you don't know what to make of Maggie Gyllenhaal \\"Lee\\" character. I mean she gets out of the mental institution and is still cutting herself. Her home is dysfunctional and Mom is very protective of her (or scared that she will do something drastic to herself again) and her Father is kind of screwed up all on his own. James Spader is just what she needed, and he is just what she needed. :)<br />James does a wonderful job as the tortured soul in this movie that has to fight himself, when he thinks there is something wrong with what they are doing. The hurt that Lee (Maggie) feels when she is rejected by Spader is so real and painful to see, that you at once realize this as more than just 2 injured people living out there non-traditional sexual desires.<br />I won't go into the details regarding the plot since it's been done so many times in the reviews before me. I will just say that at the core of this movie is a Man that has some bizarre tendencies and a Woman that has her very real dysfunctional issues. Through their own way and communication they discover a healthy albeit strange Love for one another. It is a rather touching love story in the end... it's just the way they get to it that is rather............. interesting. I know you may read a lot of reviews on this movie that says it's very Sexual... It is but not over whelming... I mean I just saw {Sex and Lucia} and {Y Tu Mama Tambien} which both had a EXTREME amount of sexuality. This one (in my opinion) is more subtle than those two. I can tell you this for a fact you may find yourself coming away from this movie with a different understanding of S&M or of the blurred line between the Dominator and the Sub.<br />I only recommend it for those that can have a open mind about non-traditional Sex roles or for those that can appreciate a somewhat Twisted movie.<br />Respectfully Reviewedat can appreciate a somewhat Twisted movie.<br />Respectfully Reviewed
B000099T2L|2.0|It's a good cd, but it's not great.  Beyonce said she wanted to make a timeless album, I'm sorry but this is not it.  I think the vocals are good but not great.  She didn't blow me away, this album will not get played very long because you get tired of the songs.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld is definitely THE GREATEST show ever. I watch both re-runs every day as part of my routine and I've seen most of them about 5 times but they're still a riot. Most people like Kramer but my favorite character has always been George because hes a lot like myself.<BR>Im buying this as soon as it hits the street and I recommend it to anyone who has a mature or refined sense of humor.
B000002G26|5.0|With the release of &quot;The Best of Me&quot; album last year, many felt it would be the BIG list of Bryan Adams hits. However &quot;So Far So Good&quot; remains the best hits package available for Adams fans. It contains pretty much ALL of his top 10 hits. From hard rocking tunes like &quot;Summer of 69&quot; to the classic love ballads like &quot;Heaven&quot;, it's all included on this album. Take a pass on &quot;Best of Me&quot; if you are only into Adams singles and pick this copy up. All of his classic hits can be found on this disc
B000065U1N|4.0|I'm not a soldier, and have never had to experience combat.  I write this review strictly from the perspective of a movie fan, particularly of war based films.  This is a great film as it creates the chaos of war, and although the BHD has been criticized for lack of character development.  I believe a lot of these soldiers remain emotionally distant as depicted in this film exactly because of the random way death chooses a soldier.  In the end it is the camararderie of the shared experience of staring death in the face and doing your job that bonds soldiers beyond even a husband and wife at times.  Great movie, and it solidifies my deep respect for all the men and women who serve and have served our country in times of peace and war.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This review probably will help no one, but I feel the need to add my thoughts amongst the others.<br />This album is awesome, and it is made even better by the fact that it seems to be pissing off many-a-moron (not that everyone who dislikes this is a moron, but some reviewers... yikes).  The only reason to dismiss this band is because you have the preconceived notion that anything popular is inherently bad or because you think that liking bands people have never heard of makes you \\"cool\\" or something like that.  If this music isn't your cup of tea, hey, I can respect that.  But to deride them for using \\"one chord\\" is just stupid.  Many Beatles and Rolling Stones songs use the same \\"one chord\\" formula the Stripes use.  Do they suck, too?<br />And to imply that \\"white people can't play the blues\\" is just absurd.  Stevie Ray Vaughn can't play or sing the blues?  Give me a break.  Or to rip on this band for recording in London and not spending enough time in Detroit?  What sane person WOULDN'T choose London over Detroit?  I do not blame this band for going to London to use old equipment to give their album a raw feel, nor do I blame them for wanting to spend time in the same country that has spawned the greatest music of the past 50 years-Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, even Jimi Hendrix was discovered there.<br />All in all, this album is certainly worth the price and worth your time.  Buy it immediatly.
B000001E7T|5.0|You hear this term Raw Emotion thrown around all the time, but in rock music anyway I don't think I've ever heard someone spatter raw emotion around on a disc with such an adept hand.  Nothing Harvey has done before or since comes close to this album, and if you knew how much I loved all her other works, you would know what a profound statement it is that I am making.  At one moment you can hear her agressive lust, in another you hear a dispirited sense of lonliness and in still another tortured angst.  Each song is so incredibly focused.  Polly Jean has always been a gifted song writer who lays it all out, but the intensity she displays here is shocking.  On this album, she took this natural gift to a level only those who have spent heart-wrenching hours trying to produce a work of art can appreciate.  I may be the wrong person to review any of her album because I have such a crush on her, but it's a quiet crush that borders on fear.  As an artist myself, I know how rarely something like To Bring You My Love happens for an artist.  I know that everyone of us ache for artistic piques like these, for they are moments in time that we fondly recall and loathe at the same time.  These are moments when food matters very little, sleep is virtually ignored, and all of the other normal human activities are temporarily cast aside.  As I stated, Polly Jean has made incredible pieces of work before and after this disc, but something like this usually comes along once in a lifetime for artists, and they spend the rest of their lives trying to recapture what they did in that all too finite and glorious moment. She has to hate this album as much as she loves it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence might have never thought their music would get so far... I'm posting from down below south america! The cover of the CD is what called my attention first... and then the name of it... Fallen. What a name! I thought, I listened to it and said: how come I never heard of them before? I should've known this was their debut album, I couldn't believe it. I am a jazz musician, grown up under rock influences, and left aside all of that and turned into this jazzy world, BUT! I still have those exceptions in my taste, Evanescence is one of those! You won't find any 'my-solos-are-faster-than-any-other' stuff, or lyrics continuing with the endless existencial dilema from the 90s. NO! Amy and her bandmates go beyond that, first of all there's beauty behind their music, brought by pain, but a pain that teaches us that suffering is not the only thing it brings with it, it gives a meaning to our lives by providing our existence a meaning, the meaning of the above natural sense of being here no matter what happens... we always remain humans n' always deserve to be loved.That's what I've learned with this band, they never thought they would be my 'shrink' but well, they are! 'n they will never know how much they might influence people from places they never even heard about before,but they surely have done an incredible contribution to help the sad-ones kind... we're too many, and this band reminded me that everything's not lost, I just wish I could hug Amy, Ben, John and Rocky... there's beauty through lyrics, melody and an angelical voice, and most important: honesty. tks evanescence!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I love Radiohead, I wouldnt definitaley say they are one of my favorite bands. I would have to say though that their last cd didnt quite do it for me. I mean there were songs on it that I loved but since OK Computer I have waiting for something as good. This cd is the one that I have been waiting for. Where as Kid A  was electronic and Amnesiac was experimental, Hail to the Thief combines all of their works. There is even some Pablo Honey on there. I will say that it is not an &quot;epic&quot; like OK Computer but I will go out on a limb and say it is just as good.<BR>Buy it.
B00003CX9Q|1.0|I am NOT giving ET 1 star based on the quality of the movie. Fantastic 5 star film. Universal's horrible collector's DVD is why I am giving it 1 star.<br />1. This DVD is not a typical snap case like most DVDs. It is made of cheap cardboard paper that folds, it doesn't snap shut. It has 3 \\"Security Device Enclosed\\" stickers on it's top, bottom, and left sides, when you taken them off the cheap cardboard it takes the paint with it and you are left with 3 ugly, paintless, white sides.<br />2. I bought this movie to see the original theatrial version, as others have stated the CGI ET and walkie talkie cops are pretty lame additions. I got the \\"Widescreen Collector's Edition\\", but when I put in my theatrical DVD it was full screen! I want to see ET the way people did in the summer of '82.<br />3. Universial blatently put in lame promotions of their other movies. One of the \\"bonus\\" editions is the theatrical trailer for the Back to the Future Trilogy.<br />I recommend the film highly, but not the 20th anniversary edition.

THE BOOK ACTUALLY HAS TWO PARTS AND THE SECOND<br />PART STARTS HALF WAY THROUGH WHEN HE PUTS ON THE HAWAIIAN SHIRT.<br />PART ONE IS WRITTEN FROM A MAN`S PERPECTIVE AND PART TWO A WOMAN`S.

0375422307|5.0|PERSEPOLIS is a graphical autobiography of the author, who experienced the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war as a child in the 1970s and 1980s. It is told in the beatiful black and white graphical language of a comic strip where simple pictures communicate strong feelings, much better than words could.<br />But PERSEPOLIS is also the story or a whole generation of young Iranians, who left their land in the quest of better conditions during the post-revolutionary era. I belong to this generation myself and I totally identified with the experiences Ms SATRAPI went through- her childhood in post revolutionary Iran, her description of Iranian society at the time, her exile in Austria- also in the volumes 2 & 3 (which already appeared in French). <br />Though conceived as a comic book, the book has messages which are not childish in nature: the child, through the naiveness of her views, points out to many of the contradictions of Iranian society that adults are unwilling to face.<br />It is also one of the rare unbiased personal accounts of what happened in Iran at the time of ther evolution and as such, is an interesting document on this period of Iranian history.<BR>(It certainly contains more information on Iran and its people than the junk broadcasted on most TV channels).<br />Some readers (including reviews posted here) criticize this book   for not being a realistic description of Iran. Though I totally disagree with this criticism,  the main point is that PERSEPOLIS is NOT a history book nor a sociological study. It is a story, the story of a childhood and the author has never claimed it to be otherwise. <br />I definitely recommend this book, first to all Iranians who live abroad, especially those who did not grow up in Iran and did not <BR>experience the revolution, and then to all readers interested in getting a human, insider view of what Iranian society was like in the early 1980s.
B000060P79|3.0|Me, I'm a guy who listens to real music. My favorite bands include Bad Religion, Metallica, Rush, Black Sabbath, Fugazi, Sentenced, Social Distortion, etc, so I'm not supposed to like these guys. Well, I do, but nobody know I have this record, I keep it in my &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; cd book. Which also include Ratt, Poison, Def Leppard, and 50 Cent, just to name a few.<br />This is an ok record, but the songs are just so catchy it's amazing. The vocals aren't the best but who cares, I haven't heard good vocals in a long time. The guitarist Jeff is amazing, he is a classicaly trained guitarist and is wild on the axe, but seems a little held back by the style of the band. The lyrics are very juvenile and they we're just written to relate to the younger crowd. But, that being said, I can't stop listening to it. It's crazy. I hate it this album, but deep down I love it.
B00005ASIL|1.0|If you're interested in rock and jazz flute, of course you should check out Jethro Tull, just not this particular compilation. You should also bear in mind that Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson was/is not the be-all and end-all of rock and jazz flute. <br />Don't forget, in addition to the rock flute examples mentioned below, lead singer/keyboardist/flutist/flautist Burton Cumming's flute solo on the great hit \\"Undun\\" from 1968's \\"Canned Wheat\\" or the omnipresent flute on the great \\"Fancy Colors\\" from Chicago's second album \\"Chicago\\". (John Lennon's \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", from \\"Help!\\", 1965, was probably one of the first rock records to showcase a flute solo, but I don't suppose it counts because the flute wasn't played by a Beatle.)<br />Don't forget, in addition to the jazz flutists/flautists mentioned below, Bud Shank and Yasef Lateef. Long before Ian Anderson arrived on the scene, Yasef Lateef was famous for simultaneously playing and speaking through his flute.
B00004STPT|5.0|Never before since the &quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Braveheart&quot; sountrack has music so perfectly fit a movie, aurally telling of a different time period and place while also matching the events and scenes in the movie so perfectly. Gladiator is one of the few motion picture soundtracks that will bring me to tears every so often such is its magic. Its tracks are majestic, powerful, mysterious, triumphant, foreboding, mournful, and poigniant. They tell of Rome of antiquity without needing to see the film (but do see the film). Like any great movie this soundtrack produces the full range of emotions in the listener. Standouts include the poigniantly sonorous &quot;Am I Not Merciful&quot;, &quot;Progeny&quot;, &quot;The Wheat&quot;, &quot;The Battle&quot;, and of course &quot;Elysium&quot;, Honor Him&quot;, and &quot;Now We Are Free&quot; the three of which flow together so perfectly they could be considered a single glorious song. It is music of this caliber that liberates the mind and soul from the physical being. I will be blessed should I ever hear another soundtrack as close to perfection as Gladiator.
B00005JM03|5.0|One of the best films of the year does not sport fancy A list cast members. It doesn't flash a 200 million plus price tag. instead it has an ensemble cast of B list actors who pull together to bring a truly enjoyable film. One of the best this year, it was largely overlooked by the public. More than your simple thief movie, this cinema dud deserves much more than what it got. Anyone who sits down and allows themselves to be taken away by this flick will not be dissapointed. A definite best buy.
0380789019|4.0|One of the cover blurbs on this book calls it &quot;A dark contemporary 'Alice in Wonderland'.&quot; I found it more a updated version of Robert Heinlein's Glory Road. The idea of taking a guy out of his normal life and forcing him to survive in an alternate universe is not original, but Gaiman, the author of illustrated novels (OK, comic books for literate kids or adults), had done wonders with it here.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the somewhat overdependence on 'magic' to resolve plot problems. Otherwise a glorious read.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Being the 5th Comic Book Movie of the new age (Since Blade), Daredevil is definitely the best. It shows a dark hero who struggles with what he does and fights with no hope. He fights a battle he knows he cannot win. And that is what makes the movie so great. Being a hero is not glamourous. Its not a bright color look at me\\" kind of thing. Its work that must be done, even if the results are very little. The pain and troubles you see the title character go through make the movie that much moe realistic, as well as the fact that Daredevil has no super strength, or speed or invulnerability. Its the best done comic movie yet, and probably the best for years to come.
B000005L86|4.0|This is absolutely beautiful music. Although the lyrics are very much along the lines of typical spiritual and Rastafarian themes, this is not your typical reggae. The music really centers around the harmonies of the voices, including the extraordinary falsetto of the lead singer. The instrumentation is sparse, and is in fact mainly percussion. You get 2 CDs, but the second one is full of alternate versions and does not add a whole lot to the package. Still, an extraordinary recording,a nd well worth a listen.
B000099T2L|3.0|I really wanted to like this CD.  In fact, it's the first one I've bought in a really long time.  But I'm sad to say it wasn't what I expected.With the Work it Out single from the Austin Powers soundtrack (although it didn't get as much airplay), I really felt like she was gonna change the game and bring something different, bluesy and funky to her solo joint but this was not the case.<br />1) Crazy in Love--Off top, I didn't immediately fall crazy in love with this song like everyone else.  I love Jay but what in the world did his verse have to do with this song? Other than the 'iller than chain smokers' line, it borders on average.  The video helped though.<br />2)Naughty Girl--I don't even listen to this.<br />3)Baby Boy--Ok, I like Sean Paul but he does absolutely nothing for this track.  Maybe if they had some real chemistry I would have enjoyed it. It sounds like they recorded it in different studios.  Hop off the bandwagon.<br />4)Hip Hop Star--This hurts my ears.  Let's just say Big Boi is not the reason I listen to Outkast.  If anything, her semi-bohemian mode would have been better suited with Andre 3000.<br />5)Be With You --Strawberry Letter 23 has been one of my favorite songs since Tevin Campbell redid it on his first CD but that is the only reason I listen to it here.<br />6)Me, Myself and I--Mature theme, real lyrics, above average production.  This is my second favorite song on the CD.  I've heard her say in various interviews that her CD is about the evolution of a woman.  This is the only song that illustrates this.<br />7)Yes--Ghost writer S. Carter is at it again.  Why is his name in the liner so much?  But if he had a hand in this song, it's appreciated. I don't so much believe that Ms. Knowles is abstinate but the concept is well crafted.<br />8)Signs--Everybody seems to be stuck on astrology nowadays but this song doesn't ring true.  Tyrese's 'version' is better.  Missy's obsession with backward words is out of place here and she is a littleannoying.  And between the two of these women, they couldn't think up a better hook than 'I love all y'all'?<br />9)Speechless--Wants to be sexy but it doesn't really stand out to me.  The guitar riffs put you in the mood of Prince but there's just something missing that I can't put my finger on.  Is it the Mariah-esque breathiness that doesn't work?  I don't know.  <br />10)That's How You Like It--If these two are indeed a couple he needs to drop her solely on the strength that she asked him to be on such a dumb song.  Jigga hasn't sounded this poppish since Vol. 3.  This should have definitely never left the studio.<br />11)The Closer I Get To You--The further away from good this album grows. If she was going with a classic artist like Luther, she should have sang some new soon-to-be-classic material.  Otherwise, she could've dragged out any newcomer and ripped this lackluster remake with a little more believability.<br />12)Dangerously In Love Part 2--Why the part 2?  She doesn't change one thing about the song other than certain parts of the beat.  Now don't get me wrong, it was my favorite on Survivor and I believe it definitely should've won her that ASCAP award for the lyrics and arrangement but once is enough.<br />13)Interlude--Yeah, we know you paint.  She needs to find an open mic and spout this so-called poetic drivel.<br />14)Gift from Virgo--Alright, somebody's got this girl open but we get it already.  You're in love.  Fine.  Say something, anything new about it.<br />15)Daddy--Surprisingly, this is my favorite by far.I believe every word she's saying and it's creative. The part about the tatoo, riding by the bayou, wanting her unborn son to be like him, all evoke images in my mind. This sounds like the real  Beyonce, a song from the album she really wanted to make (maybe that's why its a hidden track), instead of this sorry attempt to be all things to all people that Dangerously in Love turns out to be.  The sad thing is, I think he may be the one who steered her away from the original formula that would have made this disc enjoyable.The pictures were nice though.
0385335482|5.0|This is a great frivolous book. I don't know accurate it is about anything: Brits, shopping, or financial markets, but it's such a great laugh, it's a quick read!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a great hard rock album.  Try blending Poe with Linkin Park. The singer has a beautiful, strong voice that FAR surpasses any female vocalists out these days. The lyrics are edgy, haunting,and honest. Fantastique!
0679746048|3.0|I had first seen the movie and had gained intrest in reading the memoir after reading The Bell Jar. While The Bell Jar was excellent, this left me not satisfied enough.<BR>The book to me is a quick read (it's under 200 pgs.) and I sped through it rather quickly. While I will admit that this is one of the best descriptions of a former mental insitution pacient, Kaysen created incredible short chapters and it's too scattered (the film adaption puts all the events in cronological order). <BR>Also, I also didn't like how Kaysen blabs in the last two chapters. To me, the conclusion felt too much like &quot;filler&quot; words it was like taking in too much of a good thing. It is best of she just kept it a chapter short, I would've been able to handle it better.
B00000IJPU|4.0|Did Iron Maiden really need to release a double &quot;Best of...&quot; album? The critics would say no. They labelled Maiden dinosaurs, irrelevant, and saw 'Best Of The Beast' as Iron Maiden exploiting their fans.<br />Iron Maiden has never been a band to listen to critics. If they were, they would have given up after the self-titled debut. No, this release is a big middle finger salute to the self-appointed metal intelligentsia the world over. Like everything Maiden has ever released, this sold truckloads.<br />The reason why it sold well may puzzle many. If you examine this release closely, a loyal fan would already have everything here, except perhaps &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (it was not originally included on 'Iron Maiden'). The first disc covers 1986 to 1996, which many fans think of as Maiden being past their peak. The second disc is basically a studio version of 'Live After Death' with a couple of extra tracks thrown in. So, what is the value in 2 1/2 hours of music you already have?<br />Quality.<br />Iron Maiden has consistently produced metal of the finest quality alloy for nigh on a quarter of a century, rivalled by none except perhaps Judas Priest. Iron Maiden has produced so many brilliant albums over the years, with fans all having their personal favourites from each album. If you want to listen to those favourites however, it can mean an avalanche of vinyl strewn across the room. Let's say you want to listen to &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;, &quot;Wrathchild&quot;, &quot;The Number Of The Beast&quot;, &quot;Aces High&quot;, &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot;, &quot;Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter&quot; and &quot;Be Quick Or Be Dead&quot;. That can mean up to eight albums to sort through. Why not stick 'em all on two discs and package them with a little hardback book mapping out Iron Maiden's history up to that time?<br />Those who aren't Maiden fans will not understand why followers of the band would actually buy this. Fans of the band though, will understand. After all, you can't argue with seven incarnations of Eddie on a single cover.
B00005JLFC|5.0|yentl is considered one of the best movies ever produced in the 80s, in the musical/drama genre.  and barbra streisand shines in this movie.  surprisingly, it's one of the rare streisand movies.  since most studios are coming out with special editions of old movies, why do we have to wait so long for an edition of yentl?  hopefully, when it comes out, let's hope it includes extra footage, maybe some early rehearsals, including the song 'the moon and i', which was an early song in the movie.  streisand was denied honours working on this movie, so it's only fair that this movie isn't denied the special dvd treatment.  and at a time when musicals are making a comeback, yentl would definitely be a movie many people would welcome into their homes.
B00002Z88D|1.0|From the lean, mean, thrash machine they once were, Metallica have become fat, bloated rock dinosaurs of the type they once despised. The transformation from velociraptor - speedy, sharp and dangerous - to diplodocus - slow, docile and blundering - has been distressing for long time fans to watch.<br />The biggest problem here is that most of the songs are simply not suited for orchestral accompaniment. Like attempting to mix oil and water, it just doesn't work. The band really would have been better to admit the experiment did not work, cut their losses and release a four song EP of the tracks that actually DID work.<br />Let's be positive here. The tracks that they do pull off are excellent. The obvious one is \\"The Call Of The Ktulu\\". The instrumental from 'Ride The Lightning' is the oldest track here, and definitely the best, which is a shame because it's straight after the intro track, and the next two hours are basically a waste of time. Strangely, the only other song from the first four albums which even approaches \\"The Call...\\" is \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", which is given a huge, militaristic movie soundtrack feel, like something out of `Ben Hur' or `Gladiator'.<br />\\"No Leaf Clover\\" was obviously written with this performance in mind. The band lay off a little, allowing the orchestra to flood through. The strings, woodwind and brass sections weave in and out of the simple melody. Unfortunately, the other new track \\"Human\\" is, for want of a better word,.... The gentle \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is given added facets by the orchestra, although they are obvious, as the original also has orchestral backing. <br />\\"Bleeding Me\\" almost works, as do a number of other tracks, but they are very patchy. The odd introduction or bridge is good, but it is never consistent enough for a whole song.<br />Thrashers like \\"Fuel\\", \\"Master Of Puppets\\", \\"One\\" and \\"Battery\\" are absolutely ridiculous. Violins, horns, and triangles just do not belong in a song where someone is shouting\\"Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire!\\" over them. Nor do Jason Newsted's barked backing vocals fit.<br />In other places, violins play the counter-guitar lines, which are either multi-tracked or where Kirk Hammett's leads would normally be. A third guitar player would have been better than making some unfortunate violinists who have spent decades mastering their art fill in the gaps around a simple plodding guitar riff. That is when there actually are gaps. Much of the time, the orchestral instruments seem to be straining to be heard, and come off as superficial decoration. Much of Metallica's career has been built around a gargantuan rhythm guitar sound. It simply stomps over the subtleties of the orchestration, like Godzilla let loose in the Louvre. At other times, the orchestra is a nuisance, where just hearing the band on it's own would be a classic metal moment.<br />If Metallica were really considerate to their fans, as they used to claim to be before we all started sending them to the poorhouse by stealing their music off the internet, they would have released a reasonable sized unaccompanied live album (not like the overpriced 'Binge/Purge' box set) with the aforementioned orchestral EP as a bonus. Instead, we get the fat Elvis version of Metallica, a self-parody, the once shiny façade dulled by decadence and overblown egos. If you really want Metallica live, get hold of one of the hundreds of bootlegs made of the band. They do not deserve your money for this album.
B000089RVX|5.0|Something new, something different...I listen to it incessantly now...I'm going to the Nintendo Fusion Tour, which they're heading, and I'm so excited I'm going to explode.
B000002J1L|4.0|In 1970, after two failed albums,Genesis faced an uncertain future. To add to that, their guitarist Anthony Phillips, and their drummer John Mayhew, had left the band. Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks found two replacements for the departed members in guitarist Steve Hackett, and drummer Phil Collins. This lineup would make some of the most spectacular music ever.<br />Nursery Cryme, recorded and released in 1971, was their first album together. The first song, a 10 minute epic called &quot;The Musical Box,&quot; is almost worth the entire album alone. I is probably their heaviest song, and one of the their darkest (musically). The band clicks together, despite sludgy production, with Collins playing drums like a madman, Steve Hackett's amazing guitar solos, and of course, the magnificent vocals of Peter Gabriel, who was an effective vocalist even as an unknown 21 year old. One of the best songs ever. &quot;Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; is another epic, and it's very heavy and apocalyptic, again with Steve Hackett's guitar being a prominent instrument, which it wasn't most of the time when he was in the band, and Tony Banks making some worthy contributions to the song. The piano part starting the end of the song is one of the most beautiful pieces of music he ever wrote. <br />The rest of the album is somewhat ofa letdown, compared to those 2 powerful songs, though songs like those are hard to top. Phil Collins makes his first appearance as a lead vocalist in the brie but pleasant &quot;For Absent Friends.&quot; &quot;Seven Stones,&quot; a song that usually gets slack from a lot of fans, is another rather dark and somber song, and it's a great song. &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; gives insight into their playful and bizarre side, which was more evident on subsequent albums, &quot;Harlequin&quot; is a simple acoustic song w/ pretty good vocal harmonies. The last song, &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot; is 8 minutes long, but it doesn't strike me asmuch as it does the other 2 epics on this album. The band would improve themselves on their next 3 albums, but Nursery Cryme is a very transistional album and a very important album to the band, and it's worth the purchase for many of the songs.
6301763041|5.0|hmm cry baby was a good movie well it was AN EXCELLENT MOVIE because johnny depp was in it this movie deserves 5 BAGILLION stars!
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals did not become the mega-seller that The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were. The sound of the album is not radio-friendly, 3 of the 5 songs are over 10 minutes long (the other 2 are 1.5 minute songs, both called Pigs on the Wing,bookending the album), and the subject matter is a lot more austere, cynical and dismal than almost any Floyd album before or since. As a result, Animals is a shamefully underacknowledged album, and does not get recognized as much as it should.<br />The lyrical content was obviously inspired by the George Orwell novel, Animal Farm, and attacked capitalism to the fullest (Roger Waters himself was being known as the 'dictator' of the band during this time. He is credited with writing all 5 of the sonbgs, except \\"Dogs,\\" in which he shares credit w/ Dave Gilmour). It seperated humans as animals: pigs, dogs and sheep.<br />The first animal that is exposed on this album is the dog, on the 17 minute haunting opus \\"Dogs.\\" Dogs are seen as corrupt, and greedy liars who get to the top by manipulation, and make endless profits from it, only to get what they deserve at the end (\\"Have a good drown as you go down all alone dragged by the stone\\"). The Enron scandal which happened not too long ago comes into play, but business corruption has been happening for centuries.<br />\\"Pigs\\" is next. Roger Waters tears into certain groups of people who try to shove their opinions down others throats. The third verse (\\"Hey you Whitehouse...\\") is an attack, not on the White House, but on Mary Whitehouse, who is pretty much the British counterpart to Tipper Gore, in terms of censorship. <br />\\"Sheep\\" is the final epic of the album, and the sheep are portrayed as gullable followers who cannot think for themselves. For me, many groups of people resemble that description, such as middle/high school students who succumb to getting into the latest trends only to fit in, the consequence being lack of accpetance or scorn by their peers. In the middle of the song, Waters gives a bizarre adaptation of a prominent segment of the Bible (\\"The Lord is my Sheperd\\").<br />Animals is a reflection of society that is still relevant to this day. Whereas Dark Side, The Wall, and Wish You Were Here were more personal albums (mostly dealing w/ the psychological decay of Syd Barrett), Animals is probably the most political and synecological of any Pink Floyd album. It's worth listening to, and occasionally it gets the honor of being my favorite Pink Floyd album.
0800130936|1.0|Sad, tired, cliched, boring.  A black hole of humor.  You can literally feel your want for laughter being destroyed.  It's all attitude and no substance.  If you think strutting around with an air of \\"I bad\\" substitutes for a good script, then you won't be disappointed.
B0000028RR|5.0|If you are a fan of loud music....sorry scratch that- QUALITY loud music and there is only one album you ever buy again make it this one. Rage against the machine are simply one of the best bands ever. They are (or where) an intensley political(and very angry) band but dont let this put you off because they are just amazing to listen to. Their music does exactly what im sure they wanted it to do that is to sit up and take notice!! Tom Morrello is one of the most original sounding guitarists ever! If it didnt state that all sounds on this cd where made by guitar ie no djing or mixing or poop like that ,you wouldnt believe it. Some of the sounds he makes are phenomenal. If you ever buy \\"Battle of Mexico City\\" on vid or dvd(which i seriousely recomend) youll see him plucking the strings with the plug on the end of the amp chord!!!!!!!!!!!!! amongst other things. Morrello is a genius, i mean who cares if he looks kinda like a maths teacher!! I would recomend any one of rages 4 stunning albums but this one above all others!! I can safely say that this is the cd that ocupies the dark hollow that is my cd player the most. Just wakeup (snigger snigger) and buy it you fools!!
0553573403|5.0|The families that make up this series are complex. The Starks have a wolf on their banner and the motto &quot;Winter's<br />Coming.&quot; The Lannisters, who rule, hold the real power. The<br />Queen's a Lannister. The King isn't but the heir to the throne, Ser Jaime, the &quot;Kingslayer,&quot; is. I didn't find it overly<br />melodramatic. Ned is the Hand of the King. He's the Lord of<br />Winterfell. When the Starks, Lannisters, and other claimants, start preparing for war, all hell breaks loose. It begins with Ned's oldest daughter breaking off her betrothal<br />to Jaime Lannister. Then spirals downward from there.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Rages third album and my second favourite. The battle of LA doesnt have as many stand out tracks as Rage Against The Machine (their first album)but the tracks that do stand out are as good as any. Geurilla Radio is a fave of most people who have heard the album. It has a simple yet catchy tune and charactaristicaly(sorry if thats not how u spell it) angry lyrics. Other stand out tracks include Testify, Sleep Now in the Fire and of course Calm Like A Bomb which features in the quality film that is Matrix Reloaded. When the credits for Reloaded were going up i kept seated simply to listen to this song even though id heard it so many times. If youre new to rage buy their first album before you buy this one if youre not new to them you should allready own this................so this review was pointless!!
6304698690|4.0|Took a while to get it but it's in good shape
B00006RU5B|4.0|When i first got this album i listened to it on my way to uni every day for weeks and weeks. Its just so good to listen to. I have always been a Rage fan so naturaly i was curriouse as to what the lads were up too these days. I went out and bought the album straight away with my hard earned.....ahem student loan! I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Cornells voice is quality! Through all my enjoyment there was a wee cvoice in the back of my head whispering &quot;something aint right&quot;. Dont get me wrong i adore this album but you just cant get angry listening to it! Back in the day it was fun to get angry along with Zack about the way the government was treating some mexican tribe or other. There was only one reason that god gave Tom Morrello 2 arms and that was to make people want to pogo about! Tim Comerfords Basery(is that even a word?) is no longer as promenent either. That said this album is undeniabley quality..........its just not rage.
B000002ITW|5.0|I wore this recording out when I purchased the original vinyl release in the 1970's. This recording showcases four wonderful acoustic and electric musicians at the zenith of their careers. This is the original &quot;unplugged&quot; release as most of the four vinyl sides of the double album went. Crosby's &quot;Triad and Lee Shore,&quot; illustrate the power of acoustic and vocal harmonies that are rarely achieved in the studio, let alone live! Some of the guitar tuning's used for his music remind one of Joni Mitchell's every changing guitar tuning structure. David Crosby was also very responsible for the launch of Joni Mitchells career, so I'm sure she benefited greatly at this former Byrd's band members guitar work. Neil Young's &quot;On The Way Home,&quot; &quot;Cowgirl in The Sand,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let it Bring You Down,&quot; tracks are  some of finest examples of his haunting vocal prowess and his mysterious lyrical weave. I also look to this album as one of the best examples of the sound quality and capability of Martin acoustic guitars in the 70's. This sound quality and tonality have never been equaled in many musician's opinions. Stephen Stills is a powerful guitarist and lyricist and should never be missed when he can be heard on acoustic guitar. There are not many musicians who represent this type of virtuosity on the guitar like Stephen Stills. In addition to his bonus track on the release, &quot;Black Queen,&quot; I recommend giving a listen to the two other Stills solo releases which feature many tracks with him on acoustic guitar. Graham Nash provides an excellent lilting vocal counterpoint to a lot of Crosby's music. This really explains a lot of their subsequent Crosby/Nash collaboration work after the individuals of the band went off on their own directions. From time to time we have the benefit of CSN&amp;Y reunion, but it just doesn't sound this good anymore no matter where we witness a modern performance.
B000002UAX|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest albums that amounts to a collection of songs.  This is an album that you loose yourself in.  It is hard to imagine saying what the best tracks are.  The funniest is Happiness is a Warm Gun.  The two best guitar songs are While my Guitar Gently Weeps and Helter Skelter.  Probably the biggest hit is Back in the USSR.  This was the Beatles at their Creative best.  This is one of the greatest albums of all time. After spending their early albums resurrecting Rock and Roll, from Revolver through Abbey Road, they expanded the limits of Rock and Roll.  This album was no exception to that.
B00000DLVA|5.0|This is a wonderfully beautiful album reminiscent of the beauty in pulsating eathquakes, forest fires, and hurricanes. So gorgeous!
B000002JKA|5.0|This album came directly on the heels of Images and Words and while I&amp;W was a bright and had a very positive feel to it, most of Awake was very dark and angry.  The first three tracks (6:00, Caught in a Web, and Innocence Faded) are the best songs, but the whole album is good.  John Petrucci definitely went for a more layered sound and it worked really well.  This is the Dream Theater release that had the most raw, uninhibited emotion to it.  Everything from anger to loss of innocence, from lonliness to hope is on this album.  The band is creatively at their best here.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This album is a superb example of the musical and lyrical genius of Paul Simon. Each song provides a mesmerizing and deeply personal insight into the mind of a brooding man weighed down with angst. The lyrics on &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; are some of the best ever written; the song's image of a population entranced and enslaved into silence and conformity by television is amazingly prescient, especially given that it was written 35 years ago. (In this same vein check out &quot;Electric Eye&quot; by Judas Priest!) The album contains two exquisite ballads that any guitar player should have in his repertoire. OK, so a few of the songs are &quot;charmingly&quot; indicative of the era (Groovy thing). But the overall range of topics is broad and socially insightful and incisive. Great music for anyone with an opinion on society, inner angst, dreams, or any combination thereof.
B0000509C4|4.0|I liked this movie for many reasons.  One, the first one was terrifyingly scary (I was 8 when I first saw it).  Two, it was written by horror master Stephen King.  The first story, &quot;Old Chief Woodenhead,&quot; about a cigar store Indian who avenges the murders of his kindly shop owners, was creepy enough.  Only really scary if you are easily creeped out or if you watch it at night with the lights off.  The second story, &quot;The Raft,&quot; about four college students who go to a secluded lake and unwittingly become sitting ducks to a carnivorous oil slick-like blob was particularly scary.  My second favorite out of the three stories in the movie.  The last of the three and by far the simplist and most scariest was &quot;The Hitchkiker.&quot;  About a cheating wife driving home from a rendevous with her lover and runs down some poor guy. She flees the scene only to be haunted by his undead spirit.  Makeup effects by master Tom Savini were awesome.  The complaints I have about the movie are minor ones.  Why were there only three stories instead of five like in the first one?  Also, what was up with the animated wraparound story?  Yes, the first <BR>&quot;Creepshow&quot; featured animated in-betweens before and after each story, but it did not have any cartoonish interaction between characters in its prologue or epilogue.  Also the score wasn't  nearly as scary as it was in the first movie.  The fillmmakers should have tried to get the same composer to return as well as director George A. Romero.  The DVD doesn't have that many special features on it.  The trailer and a behind-the-scenes photo gallery montage are about it.  I would have liked to at least have a commentary by the director if not a couple of the cast members.  Last but not least, when will there be a &quot;Creepshow 3&quot;?  It's never too late for another sequel.  Hello, Hollywood is sequel-crazy these days.  Now is the time to strike.  Overall, a decent pick if you're looking for a fright ride.
B0000025D0|5.0|My rating - 5.25/5 For the phenomonal Racing in the Street <br />Bruce becomes just a little bit punkish after &quot;Born to Run&quot; in this album.  Bruce also looses a lot of the horns and saxaphones seen in his previous albums.  The beat slows just a bit.  The vocals are reminiscent of &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; on &quot;Born to Run.&quot;  Bruce shows us he can write gripping piano solo songs in Racing in the Street.  We will see more of this kind of music with &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, &quot;Independance Day&quot; and &quot;Drive all night&quot; all on &quot;The River.&quot;  It is sad that Bruce hasn't written more like this.  <BR>Overall this is one of Bruce's better albums, though he is better known for &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; <br />Highlights - <BR>&quot;Candy's room&quot; - An inventive song with brilliant drumwork.  The instrumental is likewise.<BR>&quot;Racing in the Streets&quot; - Probably one of Bruce's best songs ever.  Starts out with just piano, but ends with percussion and some sort of reed instrument.  This is a great song for a pensive night when you can't sleep.  So good you wont even care that the song is really about a group of streetracers.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Film is a harsh mistress. Every imperfection is magnified a million times and, the worst part, permanently recorded for all the world to see. That's why Chicago is a pleasant surprise. Director Rob Marshall in collaboration with the other performers/artists involved with the film, has turned in one of the best movie musicals since the heyday of wunderkind Bob Fosse.<br />Based on the Kander &amp; Ebb musical directed by maverick choregraphy Bob Fosse, Chicago manages to capture Fosse's spirit and make the transition from stage musical to film. That's a rarity since the &quot;death&quot; of the film musical. Rob Marshall manages to translate CHicago from one medium to another because he understands both and doesn't undercut the strengths of either medium; the musical numbers are mobile, well edited and choregraphed and he manages to integrate the mobility of film with the necessary static elements of the original stage play.<br />Although Marshall's choregrapher owes a great debt to Fosse's original work, it's uniquely his own. What's most surprising is that Marshall isn't afraid to tweak and play with the most successful elements from his stage version for the film.  Marshall keeps the original story intact. Zellweger and Zeta-Jones play, respectively, wanna-be caberet performer and the real deal who end up in prison after committing murder. Zellweger murders her lover who had promised to help her breakthrough into performing after he reveals he had no connections and was just using her for sex.<br />Zeta-Jones murders her husband and sister (her partner in their musical act)when they are caught in the act --quite literally--of commiting adultry. Thrown together due to their circumstances, Zellweger and Zeta-Jones circle like wary predators unclear on the concept of trust. They both want the same goal but it's clear that they both will do anything to reach their goals. The fact that the media rewards them with sympathetic portrayals in the paper due to their money hungry lawyer (Richard Gere)makes this trip down the dark side even more interesting.<br />Ren&eacute;e Zellweger (playing Roxie Hart) and Catherine Zeta-Jones both sparkle in their film debt as dancers and singers. While neither one has great voices, they are appropriate to the material. In fact, their strong backgrounds as actors add an element that might be missing from technically more gifted singers. Yes, they play amoral characters and, yes, none of the characters really have any socially redeeming values but they represent the very qualities that this cynical but witty look at media manipulation is all about.<br />Richard Gere is especially noteworthy. I'm not surprised that Gere's performance is so strong given his background in Broadway musical performances. What is surprising is that he'd take such a risky (but colorful) role so late in his career. His gold digging lawyer is every bit a manipulator as Roxie Hart(Zellweger). John C. O'Riley is a bit of a surprise. While he's a terrific actor, I never pictured him as a singer. He acquits himself quite well in a memorable musical number. O'Riley plays Roxie's dimwitted husband with a heart of gold. He's the only decent person in the whole film and the one everyone twists around for their own unjust cause.<br />The Kanter &amp; Ebb songs are great. Fred Ebb's lyrics are witty and among the best he had written. Kanter's music is also a highlight. It's clear that Chicago is every bit the equal (although smaller in scope)of their classic Cabaret. If Chicago isn't quite as powerful as Fosse's film version of Cabaret or even All That Jazz, it's due to the smaller scope of the story. It's equally entertaining though.<br />The transfer is terrific with the crisp picture and colors captured vividly in this DVD transfer. The sound transfer is rich although there is some noticable compression in a couple of scenes. The behind the scenes featurette isn't anything special but does provide some insight into the challenges of translating a successful musical from one medium to another. The widescreen version preserves the original aspect ratio. Although I've always been a fan of widescreen, the standard full screen version is nicely done as well. Since this film is about the onscreen dancing and singing, there's some picture loss but it won't be noticable to most folks.ranslating a successful musical from one medium to another.

B00003CX95|5.0|This movie makes Mel Gibsons acting career finally respectable.  Formerly he had just been a pretty boy in action movies, but finally shows there may be more to this Aussie than meets the eye.  <BR>Gibson takes the historical heroic tale of the Scottish Revolution against the British, led by William Wallace, mixes it with a little romance, and then recieves his Oscar.  The two notable awards were for direction, which was done creatively, especially in complex battle scenes that were too gory, and Best Picture.  <br />Briefly the movie is about a courageous young Scottsman who is forced into a fight against the English after they murdered his lover, whom he married in secret to avoid a new law giving the local Lord sexual rights to her.  As the movie progresses his fight becomes less about revenge and more about the principle of freedom: securing happiness for his imaginary family with his deceased wife.  To successfully fight the British he uses the unhappy lovesick Princess of England(stuck in a marriage with a gay man) who dreams of loving William Wallace.  The movie ends realistically, without diminishing any of the inspiration and hope that eventually drives the Scottish people to obtain their freedom.  <br />Highlights of the film: <BR>Sophie Marceau - A french actress playing the princess is surprisingly good.  She is elegant and graceful in this movie almost reminding me of the great Audrey Hepburn, if only because of her long black hair and beautiful face.  <br />David O'Hara - Plays a seemingly crazy irishman.  His antics will make you laugh, but his character will make you ponder.<br />Negatives: <BR>Battle Scenes are way too gory.  I miss the old days when violence was still only suggestive.  I don't need to see it.  In fact I would rather be able to tell it's fake.  I don't understand Hollywood's push to make dismembered burnt bodies look real.  Are we human?  <br />I'm a bit confused over the relation between the dead wife, Wallace and the princess.  The movie tries to tell you the whole fight is just for the dead wife.  It tries to convince us how much Mel Gibson loves his wife.  And yet he goes and sleeps with the princess just because she brings him some weapons.  This is why I think he was using her and probably just got a bit horny one night.

B00005JLXE|2.0|Daredevil tries to be the big blockbuster movie of the year, evident in the recruitment of young 'hot' stars Ben Afflek, Collin Farrel and Jennifer Garner, but fails miserably.  The plot is weak mostly because it is rushed so much.  The writers attempted to base the plot and movement of the movie only on a few lines and fill the rest of the time with fight scenes that look like 10 year olds trying to imitate the Matrix.  All the characters are not only one dimensional but also stupid, with motives based on confusion, \\"Elektra,\\" or in the case of \\"Bullseye,\\" capriciousness.  The ending is the capstone of disappointment in a fight that seems ridiculously easy for the difference in strength and size between Michael Clark Duncan and Ben Affleck, as if the Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) just says \\"oh you are right, I'm sorry.\\"    <BR>The relationship Daredevil has to the journalist could be interesting, but is, instead, thrown into the movie for the \\"last line's\\" sake.  <BR>In fact the only redeeming quality of the movie are the special effects and the principle of a blind man beating up people.
0375823360|5.0|This trilogy is a masterful retelling of Paradise Lost, intended as much for the actively engaged, open-minded adult as for the precocious middle reader.  Intense and vivid, these three novels challenge preconceived notions of religion, faith, truth, and institution.  They embrace a world wrought with ambiguity and allegory, with the living and the dead.  Woven with destiny and ardor, Pullman re-imagines the sanctity of youth through parallel universes, the inexorable bind between love and loss, and the inevitable weight of imperfect action.
B0000025T6|5.0|My rating - 6/5 (For two great songs Highway Patrolman and State Trooper) <br />This is a great album.  Those looking for traditional &quot;Bruce&quot; sound, however, will not find it in &quot;Nebraska.&quot;  Instead, Bruce establishes a fourth flavor to add to his unique list of music styles: Bob Dylan/Peter,Paul and Mary like guitar with Bruce's lovable vocals.  These songs are pensive, mystical and intense.  Good for playing on a dark night.  <br />Highlights <BR>&quot;Atlantic City&quot; - Bruce mixes rock and roll with his acoustic guitar in this song about a frustrated young man at the end of his rope ready to run away to Atlantic City. <BR>&quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; - A gripping story of a policeman and a delinquient brother set to music of the perfect mood: grief and dispair.  <BR>&quot;State Trooper&quot; Intense!  You'll say &quot;whoa&quot; when it's over. Not the usual sounding song though. <BR>&quot;My Fathers house&quot; - A haunting song of searching.  Picture it sung after ghost stories were told around a campfire.  <BR>&quot;Reason to believe&quot; - The album concludes on a relative note of hope in this somewhat upbeat quasi country tune.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Why not give this 5 stars.  It's a nice overview on Sade from 1985 to 1993.  A few pieces from each disc.  You can see how the music becomes more sophisticated.  The Lovers Live disc has no contributions to this disc.  If you're a new fan it gives you a good sample of Sade.  It will make you buy each separate disc individually, because she has a great sound.  Everyone today sounds like her.  She is the standard.  New fan, buy this disc.  It will make you want every song she has done.
B00005JLRT|2.0|After seeing the latest Star Trek I wish Hollywood would finally put the lame horse to death: and I liked the TV series!  This movie yet again focuses on Data, a completely uninteresting character with no personality, and the impressive Jean Luc Picard, who seems to be the only consistantly positive note in all the Star Trek movies only because of the superb acting of Patrik Stewart.  This movies weak plot centers around a clone of Jean Luc Picard, raising determinism and free will issues.  The clone doesn't seem like a real person but just a sadistic movie villain, evident in the random and pointless sensual scene between the clone and Dana Troi.  The ending continues to highlight Data's pursuit to become human in an act of unbelievable utilitarian sacrifice.  Unfortunately the tolerable Data is then replaced by a stupid spineless version of the android: no doubt Brent Spinner's attempt to write a more challenging acting role for himself in the sequel.  <BR>Previews make this film look like a big action blockbuster, but are decieving.  <BR>Lastly there are even more references to former Star Trek movies and shows in this movie which make this movie more like another episode on TV.  <BR>Overall a disappointment.  First Contact was definately the best Star Trek:TNG movie.
B000000WJK|5.0|Milkbaby believes This album by the verve is there best work,Stargazing I call this.This is the kind of music you listen to on Psychadelic drugs(someday I shall try this but not now I'm on medication)Mes also believe this album was ahead of its time when it came out in 1993,what am I saying it was ahead of its time.I would have loved to have been a college student in 1993 and owned this album and exposed young Americans to the Sound of the Future.If yer into this kind of DREAM POP Music you should definetly buy this album,you probably won't regret it.If the Verve came out today the hype machine would be all over them where as 10 years ago that wasn't the case.All though they did manage to get on the 2nd stage at lollipalooza.<BR>The Verve were playing there own sound back in 1993 and for the most part set back and waited in obscureity(sorry if I mispelled that)for the rest of the world to Play musical Catch-up.A+
B0000640VO|1.0|Amelie starts auspiciously because of it's unique story telling and direction.  The movie is interactive between real life and Amelie (main character) imagination.  This later expands to the \\"prince\\" in the movie.  I can appreciate it for this, but those looking for a feel good romantic comedy will not find it here!!  Plan on spending most of the movie confused.  Amelie decides to help strangers because of her disfunctional way of relating to people personally.  Amelie's progress is obviously, and condescendingly, paralleled by the painting of her equally eccentric and strange neighbor.  In fact there isn't a normal person in this movie: perhaps a feature that makes the \\"cute\\" to most.  <BR>The main point of the movie is that Amelie, as odd as she is, can find someone equally odd.  Unfortunately the disfunctionality of both 'lovers,' while starting as a cute crush and creative chase, ends as frustratingly after several failed attempts to simply say hello.  <BR>In short Amelie's disfunctional nature, and the movies obvious existential overtones,  are overstressed to the point that I want to[get sick].
B00005YXZH|2.0|The words &quot;self-indulgent,&quot; &quot;pretentious,&quot; and &quot;self-conscious&quot; come to mind.  It's like going to a lecture on a Saturday night; no fun.  I don't feel the need to appreciate this CD on repeated listenings simply because every rock critic tells me I should. Wilco has run their course.  Time to form a new band.
B000002BFL|4.0|My rating - 4.5/5 <BR>The &quot;Nebraska&quot; song styles and Bruce's acoustic guitar return in &quot;Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot; this time dealing mostly with immigration and immagrant workers rather than hometown unemployed Americans.  Usage of strings in this album gives it a more ghostly mood, but is not quite as dark or intense as it's predecessor. Some songs are too long for their medeocre melodies.  Overall a good album though.  <br />Highlights - <BR>&quot;Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; - Haunting and catchy.  So much so that I didn't really care that I didn't know who Tom Joad was or what he has to do with poverty.  <BR>&quot;Youngstown&quot; - An intense song for the factory worker and the war veteran.  <BR>&quot;Across the Border&quot;- A great song of hope for a family trying to make it to the U.S. for better work.  The instrumental features a string duet that reminds me of Pachelbel.  <br />Negatives - <BR>&quot;Dry Lightning&quot; - Not a very good song.
B000001Y5J|5.0|If Pretty Hate Machine was Nine Inch Nails' &quot;pop&quot; album then this is definatly Trent's &quot;thrash&quot; album. This, taking its running time into consideration, is NINs most angry album. There are 8 songs, two of which are short instrumentals. The instumentals are Pinion and Help Me I am in Hell, and there is also a cover of Adam Ant's Physical. If you are new to NIN then pick up PHM or the Downward Spiral and save this one for later or you might be turned off.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This movie is a heart wrenching dramatic fight over the fate of indigenous South American people during the time of the Jesuit order.  Be warned you will cry at the end of this movie, as I did.  <br />The movie is chiefly about two priests.  The first, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) is a loving lovable Jesuit devoted only to the welfare of the native americans.  The second, Mendoza (De Niro) is a retired military man who leaves his life of slave trading for penitance after killing his adultering brother.  Mendoza lives with the natives and other jesuits mostly to forget about his sorrowful past.  In the end the Jesuits characters are tested when the Portuguese decide to invade the native village for political motives, and we learn something about Gabriel and Mendoza.  <br />This is a depressing movie dealing with God, devotion, the church and the ultimately overpowering evil of men, that will make you angry.  Watch carefully though, because there is a slight glimmer of hope amidst all the dispair, if only in the beautiful but somewhat sorrowful Oboe tune played by Father Gabriel when he first meets the Gauranee.  <BR>Definately worth watching.
B000089CJI|5.0|I am speechless...this is one of the best ..things i 've heard all year...
0375707972|5.0|Being German, I have read many books on the holocaust and WWII.  However, no book has moved me as much as this one.  Written by a German, this book takes a completely different approach to the topic of the holocaust and the rise of the Nazis, a human approach. It allows the reader to read about this time without feeling intimated or uncomfortable.  Schlink broaches the subject in a very unique way, very indirectly, but lets the reader understand the horrors of that period in German history - I was very moved.  The story itself is very clever and well written.  It's hard to say that one enjoyed reading about such a topic, but it was for me a very refreshing and refined way to look at how this period in German history affected Germans.  Not in an in your face way.  This is a fine piece of literature.

The movie even criticizes itself, with air speed velocities of a swallow (the explanation of how they got coconuts). I don't know anyone who doesn't like this movie. Get the DVD! The VHS isn't widescreen, so titles of the chapters are cut off (I've watched the VHS, it cuts off a lot). Check it out!

B000050FEN|4.0|Despite and ending which becomes all too apparent from the start, this movie is an excellent example of how good direction can really turn a movie around. <BR>Unforgiving and bloody everything in the movie is as down to earth and realistic as it could be, given its setting. There are no unanswered questions like 'Why'd he do it that way?' or 'Is the detective so stupid' an so on that usually plague movies of this genre.<BR>Simply put, if you want a feel good movie stay away.<BR>Else hop on abroad.
0380730367|5.0|This guy (Lehene) is good. What a teriffic plot, and I find myself laughing out loud with the banter between Angie, Patrick, Bubba (is this guy a piece of work or what?). This is great reading. If you can get the unabridged book on tape, it is worth the extra $$$. The readers \\"Basten\\" accent adds a dimension to the story that cannot come thru in written form.
0385504209|3.0|After reading the far better \\"Dream of Scipio\\" by Iain Pears, this book underwhelmed me. Granted it kept my attention and caused me to turn every page, but no better or worse then any other formulaic bestseller.<br />I was caused to recall \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" as a similar novel that left the reader high and dry at the end just as this book predictably did. I wouldn't say it was disappointing, but if you want to have something good to read on the beach wait for the paperback and don't shell out the [money amount] cover price.<br />Despite the numerous twists and turns, I was caused to determine the identity of the arch-villain about a hundred pages before the end of the book...and felt that the book made a better work up for a screenplay then it did a full blown novel.<br />Overall, if you don't mind checking your intellect at the door and suspending all sense of reason, this is a shallow but somewhat entertaining escape for those seeking shelter from more trying day to day endeavors.

B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem Show is the first hip-hop or rap CD I ever bought & I like it a lot.  Most the tracks have this insidiously hypnotic beat, coupled with a great chorus - - in particular, Track 4: Cleaning Out My Closet; Track 12: Sing For the Moment; Track 13: Superman  Even if you don't like rap there is something compelling in the way Eminem structures his music - - some tracks are almost symphonic.  Then there are the lyrics which, in my opinion, make this CD so great.      <BR>The Eminem Show reminds me a lot of Bob Dylan's early records. Stylistically, they are clearly very different.  But like Dylan, Eminem is very smart, and his intelligence is what makes him such a great lyricist (Eminem is more literal).  Also like the young Dylan, Eminem's favorite subject is the flawed human being, especially women who have hurt him, hypocrites and users in all forms.  He is emotionally raw, often sardonic, very angry and he is not afraid to mock and even show contempt for his fans (his white fans at least).  Moreover, Eminem can be mean - - but for all the flak he takes I don't think he is truly as mean as Dylan; he's just uses obscene language so it seems meaner.  (For example, Like A Rolling Stone oozes with a contempt and scorn for the people who listened to Dylan's music (the hippies) that Eminem has not matched.  And  Positively 4th Street must be the meanest song in the history of pop music.)<BR>After The Eminem Show, I bought Marshall Mathers LP CD.  I like that too but I found The Eminem Show to be more interesting.
B0000A36J5|3.0|I will start by saying that even though I was disappointed by the how the book was adapted to the screen; it was still a good film. It visually stunning and all the locations were perfect. But I, like many others have said before, had several problems with how the book was adapted. FotR was perfect; it was everything I could ask for in a LotR film. But with Two Towers I'm still trying to justify some of the huge changes Jackson made to the story. I believe that some of the changes in the film altered many of the underlying themes and characters in book. It's not so much that he got the story wrong, he got the meaning wrong. I do have hope for the final film though. Jackson does say on the FotR extended director's commentary the Two Towers is the film the deviates furthest from the book. If that is true then RotK can only be better. Having said all that I still plan on buy the both theatrical and extended editions for all three films.

0671042858|3.0|This book is a departure from Stephen's King regular style. I am not a baseball fan and did not particularly love this book. I love Stephen King but I thought this writing experiment was rather dull and lacked a lot of the imagination in his other books.

At times I thought the writing was just too self-conscious, too ornate; it distracted me from the story.  Perhaps I'm just one of those meat-n-potatoes readers who likes story over style.  <BR>    I did like the ending; gullible me, I was surprised.

I would not recommend it to the depressed, or to anyone suffering from post-partum blues!
B00005JLRT|4.0|The movie is good, but the only DVD choice is anamorphic and Picard's head gets annoyingly pointy. If I were to purchase it again, I would likely choose the fullscreen edition, even though I hate giving up all the extra images from the edges.   <BR>I would hope the folks who release films would give us the choice of preserving the original aspect ratio, with larger black lines at the top and bottom.

0684853523|5.0|I have not read one single book by Stephen King except for this one. But having read this superb book, I believe I'm going to pick up one of his other ones, take a deep breath, and dive into his spooky world. On Writing was given to me by a writing friend, or perhaps I never would have read it, as I don't like the sci-fi, horror, weird genre of his stuff. But this one, this On Writing treatise (and it's short, less than 300 pages), works on so many levels, and none of them are spooky. It's part memoir, part philosophy, part motivational, and a bit, too, on the actual craft. Don't buy it is you're looking just for a how-to book; it's not meant to be any such thing. DO buy it if you want to read an extremely well-written book about the process of writing, the journey toward becoming someone who can call oneself a writer, the obstacles (including King's horrific accident) to the process and if you're interested in Stephen King, the man, and Tabitha, his muse. Within the middle of the book, aspiring writers will find a pithy and terse section of writing advice; nothing new here, but coming from such a master, this advice should be taken seriously by all wannabe writers.<BR>A rambling, intelligent, imminently readable book.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio, i fell in love. Even though the band is not \\"new\\" and \\"groundbreaking\\" I think that they really an incredably talented band and their cd is amazing. Trust me, it's worth it. But, exuse me, what the heck is all of this crap about them being the same as Linkin Park? Are they seriously talking about the same band? I'm thinking they just heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and decided that they were too smart to actually LISTEN to the cd and figure out that they had a guest artist for ONE SONG. On the other hand, maybe they are just jealous that Evanescence has more talent than some crap band who, at the beginning of their career was really good, but now, well, they basically had two songs, and they just remixed them a lot and put different names on them. The truth hurts, doesn't it.
0385504209|5.0|I have read many books and no other piece of literary work has captured my attention in this fashion from page 1 and on.  I doubt I will ever find another book of this caliber.  HUGE fan!
B000002P2W|4.0|I will admit, on first listen this album is not as rewarding as it is after a few listens. The fourth album of possibly the greatest winning streak in rock history, it had hard acts to follow. &quot;Tommy&quot;, the ultimate rock opera, &quot;Who's Next&quot;, the ultimate hard rock album, and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, the ULTIMATE album period are all pretty hard albums to beat. They also all had the hard rock, signature Who sound that we've all come to know and love. Also, Tommy and Quadrophenia are concept albums and rock operas. The Who By Numbers is not quite any of the aforementioned qualities, however for what it is, it is a pretty damn good album. <BR>        It has some typical good Who hard rock in &quot;Slip Kid&quot;, &quot;How Many Friends&quot;, and to a lesser extent, &quot;Dreaming From the Waist&quot; and &quot;In A Hand or Face&quot; (both of which sound like typical Who songs, yet add in some new backup harmony parts that occur a lot throughout this album.) The Who By Numbers introduces a new song style that attempts to show Pete Townshends singer/songwriter talents. &quot;However Much I Booze&quot; and &quot;Blue Red and Grey&quot;, though they lack good words, are wonderfully written and sung songs. Though Daltrey sings on &quot;How Many Friends&quot; and &quot;Imagine A Man&quot;, they are nevertheless the work of Pete Townshend, and show of the poppy/ballad side of his songwriting skills that we rarely see on other Who albums. &quot;Success Story&quot; and &quot;Squeezebox&quot; are also obvious highlights, though they don't really fit in with any other Who type song.<BR>      Overall, this is an album of well-written ballads and hard rock type Who songs. The only reason I took one point off of perfect is that unnecessary sounds and vocal alterations are added in which take away from the strength of the songs. They Are All In Love would have been fine as a love song in which Daltrey uses his ballad voice instead of his rough, screaming voice,yet in the second verse of the song he stops using his ballad voice and switches to his hard rock voice. Also, he adds in a little, I'm not sure what to call it... fart sound made with his tongue in the middle of the verse which I think is pretty stupid. <BR>        Other than that, with a few listens, any Who fan will be able to appreciate this solid 1975 release as another great release by the Who.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Sutherland, Pavarotti, and Caballe, all in the prime.

NO one can touch his &quot;Nessum Dorma&quot;<BR>Dame Joans throws the most beautiful voice to make Turandot both icy and passionate. No other Turandot can say that.

B000000XCH|5.0|Amazon.com reviewers have no idea what they're talking about. Yes, this album has many popular singles on it, but that's not all. Every single song on this album is amazing and this is by far Creedence Clearwater Revival's best album. I was never really excited by any CCR album as I was excited with this one. <BR>      It combines every good quality of CCR on to one wonderful album. It has the extended/jam tracks that are essential to any southern rock album, in my opinion. \\"Ramble Tamble\\" is a 7-minute rocker that just makes want to get up and start playing air guitar. While most people dispose of \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" as excessive or filler, I find it to be one of the best songs on the album. CCR adapted the song as well as any other artist could have. Surprisingly, John Fogerty puts about a pretty damn good 7 minute guitar solo, proving that he is one of the most underrated guitar players of the seventies. <BR>       Also included on this album are the fifties covers/sounding tunes that Fogerty loves so much. \\"My Baby Left Me\\" and \\"Ooby Dooby\\" are both fifties covers, but are still both awesome. In fact I've come to like the 50's type songs CCR does as well as any of their other stuff because of the ones they do on this album. Truly great.<BR>      Of course, there are the wonderfully written and catchy pop-like southern rock (for lack of a better style name) songs that Fogerty and CCR are most famous for. For example \\"Travelin' Band\\" which is perhaps my favorite CCR song ever, \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\" which is as catchy as any XTC song, though totally different, \\"Up Around the Bend\\" which is catchy in a way only John Fogerty can achieve, \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" a tale of a Southern home in a Southern city which is of course another gem, and \\"Long As I Can See the Light\\", a good way to end this amazing album on a high, but slow, note. <BR>        I cannot stress enough how good this album is. It is up there with such amazing southern rock albums as\\"Allman Brothers Live At the FIllmore East\\" and \\"Pronounced Leh-nerd Skeh-nerd\\", and may be even more impressive than those two. No matter who you are, you have to have this album!!!!!! Though amazon.com was incorrect in simply calling it a singles album, they were completely justified in rating it an ESSENTIAL ALBUM. Buy it NOW
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a very good movie. Some people said it was confusing and hard to understand, but I didn't find it confusing at all. It is the story of Thomas Anderson also known as Neo. I can't explain the story because you have to see it for yourself, but it is not as complicated as you think. The visual effects are ground-breaking and are gonna be imitate by every action movie in the future. The Matrix is better than his sequel The Matrix Reloaded, who has less story, but more action. The DVD has some cool extras, but buy it, at least for the movie.
B00004Y6OA|3.0|WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST the third album by VAN HALEN has the unlucky spot of being released by two classic albums VH1, AND VH2, and although this is a solid album, it doesnt come close to the greatness of the first two. This album does has some killer songs AND THE CRADLE WILL ROCK, EVERYBODY WANTS SOME, TAKE YOUR WHISKEY HOME, COULD THIS BE MAGIC, IN A SIMPLE RHYME. The instrumental TORA TORA is also a good song. Its the other 3 songs, FOOLS, ROMEO DELIGHT, and LOSS OF CONTROL, that are the filler material on this album. This album still has some killer riffs and some awesome musicianship throughout, it just doesnt stand up well with the first two albums. I might be in the minority here, but I think the following album FAIR WARNING is a much better album than this one. I not saying you will not enjoy it, it is a solid album, it just lacks the power of the first two. It would still make a great addition to your collection
0671027387|3.0|I picked this book up for a plane trip, and it was an OK page-turner with one cliff-hanger after another but was mostly disappointing, especially after The DaVinci Code, which has its flaws but overall is a superior thriller.<br />Books like this are fantasies, but the authors need to get some things right. Some details in Brown's book were wrong, and the atmosphere and tone were off. The impression is that Brown confined his research to the internet and maybe some books, so he picked up some details, but also got other details wrong and lacked a real sense of place. One small thing, but it was jarring: Brown has a character in a taxicab in Washington, DC, with the meter running.  DC doesn't have a meter system. Fares are set by zones on a map. This makes me wonder whether Brown ever has spent much time in DC. His description of political processes in DC also is wrong in many details and doesn't show the level of understanding he would have gotten from regularly reading political news in any major US newspaper.<br />The most jarring thing, though, is how gullible he makes some supposedly sophisticated and smart scientists. His whole plot depends on their gullibility. I'm not a scientist, but a supposedly astonishing discovery at the start of the book drives all the action that follows. From the very beginning, there were some obvious questions about the discovery, but these world-class scientists didn't think to ask them. Real scientist are skeptical, probing, and contrarian. But not Brown's characters, and that really was inexplicable.<br />So I made it to the end of this book, but never really managed to suspend disbelief.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I borrowed this cd from my friend a couple days ago. I listened to it about 5 or 6 times. I'm still listening to it. It my favorite nofx album second only to &quot;So long, and thanks for all the shoes&quot;. Some people were turned off by the political aspects of this album, I think they are the most relevant I have heard. They aren't calling for a massive revolution, as do some bands. They simply want the listener to acknowledge the problems that exist. Songs such as &quot;Franco Un-American&quot;, and &quot;seperation of church and skate&quot; are my favorites. The growth in NOFX's creativity has begun to show more and more since the addition of El Hefe in the early 90's (listen to the decline). I personally think, they get better and better with each album. When NOFX makes a bad album, I'll vote for Bush.
0783114222|2.0|...<br />Many reviewer have rightfully praised some of the good value of this TV miniseries (even though, I would not rate this film so high, because it also comprises truly inferior sequences, such the Apollo-13 part - which, in the ligh of the Apolo 13 movie,  could have been neither avoided nor successfully included - or the annoying Apollo-7 [or the majority of the Apollo-8] parts). However, what most, if not all, of those reviewers miss is to compare this film to reality. And that is the point where this semi-documentary fails.<br />My biggest concern is that this film is being just too patriotic on the account of treating people, who were responsible for putting Americans on the Moon in the first place, with dignity and fairness. First of all, where is the sole person who made J.F. Kenendy's dream come true - German chief rocket designer, Dr. Wernher von Braun - in the film? He designed the mighty Saturn 5 rocket (and most of its predecessors), which was the very point the USA could beat the Soviets (the Russians' Moon boosters kept blowing up, while the Saturn rockets worked flawlessly). Yet Dr. Braun appears in the 10-hour film for literally a few seconds - and only for mocking on him. It is shameless. Where is the 110-meter tall Saturn booster, the main attraction of the Kennedy's Space Centre Visitor Complex, the biggest and best rocket ever designed and built in the world, mentioned in this 12-part series? Nowhere ... while over an hour is dedicated to the building of the Lunar Module, which would have stayed on ground forewer, had NASA not had the Saturn rockets.<br />By the way, LEM was designed under the leadership of Canadian engineers (who had been involved with Canada's Avro Arrow superplane project), and even the legs of the descent module were also manufactured in Canada. Many Canadian, British and German engineers were involved with the NASA project - and even Hungarians [one of them designed the Lunar Rover] -, yet no other nation than Americanis mentioned in this 600-minute series. With all due respect, bored housewives contributed to the program a lot less than those people (first and foremost Dr. von Braun) -, yet the film erects a statue for them (which alone would be fine and righful), but completely forgetting about those \\"foreign\\" scientists and engineers, without whom NASA would have never been successful. (Just see, please, how NASA has been struggling ever since those \\"foreigners\\" had left out of the picture.) <br />Unlike - the much better, elbeit also inaccurate - 'The Right Stuff', this miniseries is virtually ignors the Soviets as well, who were the pioneers in space exploration, and Americans had followed their footsteps up until before landing Americans on the Moon. The space race was [righfully, I admit full-heartedly] won by the Americans - but the film ignores the fact that by not much. The first human-made device landing on the Moon was the Russian Lunik-9, the first earthly creatures orbiting the Moon were Russian turtles, and the first colour photograph showing earth-rise seen from the vicinity of the Moon was taken by a Soviet Zond [the unmanned Russian Lunar spacecraft]. Had the Americans finished the LM in time - and, as a result, had they skipped the Apollo-8 moon-orbit flight in order to take the LEM to Earth orbit right away - the Soviets might have beaten the USA by the first manned lunar orbit... But the Soviets were just playing safe to put animals aboard their lunar spaceship first, which resulted the loss of the race to the Moon. (On the other hand, NASA took a huge risk with sending a crew aboard Apollo-8 to the Moon; Had the O2 tank exploded in the Apollo-8's Service Module and not in the Apollo-13's [the faulty design had already been there], there would have been no way of saving those three astronauts, considering the absence of the Lunar Module that would serve as a lifeboat.) NASA gambled - and won ... but they do not always win {see the bad fate of Challenger and,most recently, Columbia... By the way, the Soviets tested their shuttle, Buran, unmanned + a Soyuz spacecraft - originally designed for taking cosmonauts to the Moon - could have been used as a lifeboat, had the Buran's [presumably 2- or 3-member] crew {who never flew in the reality} been in danger during subsequent flights. Compared this cautious approach to the American Space Shuttle program, please...})<br />I take my hat off, however, before Tom Hanks, who, at the beginning of one of the episodes, is trying to make a balance by stating: \\"Without Tsiolkovsky, Koroljev and von Braun <two Russian and a German rocket scientists> America could have never gone to the Moon.\\" It is very true - but where are those genetlemen in this long and detailed TV miniseries...?<br />P.s.: My concern is not what is in this 12-part TV series [becasue there is a lot, indeed] - but rather what is missing ... and due to the neglect of those important factors described above, I just can not enjoy this film...

B000001ELP|5.0|I just had to put my 2 cents worth in on this one. I've been a Kiss fan since I was 4 and my dad bought me &quot;Love Gun&quot;. By the time &quot;The Elder&quot; came out I was still pretty young so to me it was another great Kiss album. As I got older and became a musician myself I realized that this was, is, and will always be their best album ever. Kiss definitely treaded on different ground for this album but in doing so they created a musical masterpiece. I would almost call it progressive rock. I've always loved the fact that it was so obscure compared to all of their other albums. Highlights for me include 'Under The Rose' where Gene's voice is hauntingly brilliant, 'The Oath' which probably rocks the hardest, and 'Odysee'which I see some people slammed but I think is a great almost &quot;Moody Bluesish&quot; ballad with a great arrangement. The only thing that disappointed me when the re-mastered version came out was the track order. I remember the LP and the &quot;non re-mastered&quot; CD started out with 'The Oath' and then the next 5 or so tracks were in a different order which seemed to go along with the concept a little better. Other than that I would conclude by saying if you're a Kiss fan buy this CD. If you can't stand Kiss because you think they're nothing but a circus with no musical talent you gotta hear them on this CD. It will give you new respect.
B00000F169|4.0|Yes, this film is not for the general couch potato who wants to be given entertainment on a silver platter.  Please rent Star Trek-Numbesis and ogle at the zillion dollar effects.<br />This movie is a must for film buffs and sci-fi buffs.  Place yourself in the year 1974; Kubrick's \\"2001\\" had set the stage for sci-fi presentation, the Star Trek TV series for stories with meaning, 50s sci-fi flicks for kitsch.  Carpenter and O'Bannon create an incredible parody to counter the established sci-fi genre with something unexpected.<br />Life in space isn't mysterious, it isn't majestic, it isn't noble.  It's outright boring, boring, boring.  People go loopy and act stupid when bored out of their skulls.  Crew members don't die from defending our way of life, they die from equipment breakdowns.  Aliens aren't big-brained morally righteous gods or armies of monsters, they're silly beachballs.  Computers aren't soulless mechina, they're as snippy and neurotic as the rest of the crew.<br />The movie offers a view of things to come from both Carpenter and O'Bannon. By taking this work as a skills-in-progress snapshot, you can see how both are forming their craft in movie-making.  Carpenter's penchant for dark shadowy scenes is obvious, and O'Bannon displays his evolving talents at storytelling.  Then take into consideration that the entire film was created for under $60,000 and you can appreciate the accomplishment.<br />If you appreciate the history of cinema and science fiction, you'll appreciate Dark Star.  Let there be light.<br />Movie - 5<BR>Content - 3<BR>DVD Quality - 2<BR>Overall - 4
B000089RVX|5.0|For all those thinking that Evanescence is another band who just mixes guitar in with turntables (hybrid music) you are sadly mistaken. If you buy the cd by basing it upon the single Bring me to life you will either be eerily impressed or shockingly impressed. <br />1. Going Under 5/5 - amazing opening to not only the whole song but the whole album. Amy's first words will have you hooked<br />2. Bring Me to Life 3.5/5 - ironically the song that made me buy the cd but the weakest song on the album, (mainly because of my dislike for paul mccoy's involvement) or because of the overkill on the radio.<br />3. Everybodys Fool 4/5 - slow opening but amy does it again as she just drags you into the song. Bens guitar on this track is great too.<br />4. My Immortal 5/5 - Amy + her piano = a winning combination. This song is filled with so much emotion it will leave you speechless.<br />5. Haunted 4/5 - Excellent pick of the pace after the last track. Great lyrics.<br />6. Tourniquet 6/5 - Another one of the best songs on the album. Shows great incite into Amys darkness. This song is just off the scale!<br />7. Imaginary 4/5 - Just when you think the brilliance will stop this song will pop up, great lyrics and melody.<br />8. Taking Over Me 4.5/5 - Amazing lyrics in this song.<br />9. Hello 4/5 - Gotta wonder who she is talking to on this one but a remorseful song nonetheless.<br />10. My Last Breath 4/5 - Good song with smart lyrics.<br />11. Whisper 4.5/5 - Great ending to a great album, the choir goes well with Amy on this one.
B00005Q7TV|4.0|Just received the CD - I'm now listening to this album for the first time in . . . . oh . . . probably fifteen years and it's still amazingly enjoyable.  Actually, my original vinyl LP was the english language variant with lyrics by Peter Hammill (is that version available anywhere?).  And while I was a huge Hammill and VDGG fan I found the lyrics very clumsy and a detriment to the music.  Hearing the original version now (even though I don't speak Italian)I realize what a good prog album this was.  Moody and melodic, it reminds me more of the \\"Nursery Chryme / Foxtrot\\" era Genesis if I had to compare to any other prog cornerstone.  Well worth picking up.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I thought that X2: X-Men United was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting was awsome, and all the special affects and camera work was amazing. One of the only complaint of the movie was that on the poster, they should've put a more important character than Storm there, and the fact that it was blaintly obvious that there will be a sequel, but hey, that still does not stop me from giving it 5 stars. Hugh Jackman was once again amazing as Wolverine, and the same goes for James Marsden as Cyclops, and the whole reat of the cast. They all did outstanding jobs, anf I can't even find a word big enough to say how good they all did. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job directing this movie as he did on the first.<br />-Plot-<br />     Wolverine comes back from his trip of trying to find out who he was fifteen tears ago that he left for at the end of the first movie, and there is an asassination attempt on the president by a mutant. Xavier finds the mutant on Boston, so he sends Jean and Storm there to find him, while he and Cyclops leave to go visit Magneto in his plastic prison. However, Stryker has used some \\"persuasive\\" skills on Magneto, and got him to tell him everything about the Cerebro, a machine he created with Xavier a long time ago. When Xavier and Cyclops go to visit him, Stryker captures both of them. Meanwhile, Jean and Storm find the mutant that attacked the president, but find out that he, Nightcrawler, didn't do it intentionally, but the was kind of under Stryker's control, however they do not know this yet. <BR>     While everyone is gone, Wolverine is left to watch the school. That night, Stryker gets some army people and infiltrates the school. Wolverine got out with Bobby, Rouge, and Pyro. However, most of the student got kidnapped. They, Wolverine Pyro, Rouge, and Bobby, took Cyclops's car to Boston to find Jean and Storm, but stopped at Bobby's house, since his parents and little brother live there. Bobby then tells his family that he's a mutant, but it turns into this \\"coming out scene gone horribly wrong.\\" <BR>     Jean and Storm call a cell phone that was found in Cyclops's car, and Wolverine tells them to get there soon. They do get there quickly, but the four of them, Wolverine, Pyro, Rouge, and Bobby kind of have to fight off police officers in order to get out, and on to the jet. However, they get missiles shot at them, and one hits the jet. Magneto, who somehow escaped his plastic prison, stops the jet from falling on to the ground, and saves them from dying in a crash. Mystique, of course, is with Magneto. After talking with each other, the all decide to unite forces and stop Stryker. <BR>     They get to Stryker's hidden base, and try to stop Stryker from killing all of mutant-kind, but while they are in there, Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike have this awesome fight-to-the-death scene with all of this stabbing, slashing, and punching. Gladly, Wolverine comes out on top, and kills Lady Deathstrike by injecting a large tub of adamantine into her body. It cools, and she falls into a big tub of water, and sinks to the bottom. You even hear he clink when she reaches there. Everyone gets out of the dam alive, including all of the kids who attend Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Magneto, and Mystique escape in a helicopter, and Pyro goes with them. <BR>     However, just as everyone is about to leave in the jet, the dam breaks down, and the jet won't start. They do manage to escape from there, but one character \\"dies.\\" If I told you who dies, or why I put the word dies in quotes, then it would give away the ending, and make this review a bad one, so you'll have to see the movie to find out.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette is awsome in this album. It has the perfect balance of gutsy determination and drive with the raw emotional form. The songs are beautifuly written, all in all a must have album. A rare tresure of raw musical talent that is garenteed to be preserved by people who know a good thing when they hear it.

B000022TSH|5.0|Watching Chinatown again recently, it struck me that it is just about perfect.  All the elements of film-making were performed here at an extraordinarily high level, and the result is one of the most satisfying movies ever made. Much imitated, rarely equalled, Chinatown is THE standard against which period mysteries must be measured.<br />Start with the wonderful script by Robert Towne that borrows from and re-imagines LA history without straying too far from the facts.  A  convoluted story of local political machinations is also the setting for a murder mystery set amid family secrets and betrayals.  His plot, characters and dialogue entertain and intrigue us and the film's brilliant central metaphor, Chinatown, reveals, conceals and resonates long after the credits roll.  Great stuff.<br /><br />Next, people the story with a terrific cast led by a sauve and cynical Jack Nicholson as PI Jake Gittes, who despite his worldliness is in way-over-his-head without knowing it, Faye Dunaway as the fragile femme fatale, Evelyn Mulwray, and John Huston as one of the most memorable villains in moviedom as the rich & powerful, ruthless yet seemingly benign, Noah Cross.  The supporting players are equally well-cast.<br />Then put this story and cast in the hands of a brilliant director with an equally gifted cinematographer, and turn them loose.  Roman Polanski was an inspired choice to direct this film, not only because (as mentioned in the retrospective on the DVD) he brought a European sensiblity to this very American story of political & economic intrigue but also because as he had demonstrated in his earlier works (Knife in the Water, Repulsion, etc.) Polanski is adept at creating tension and dread on film.  Chinatown's great success is in the atmosphere and tension and ominous feel of foreboding that overlays the film. We, like Jake, don't know where we are going or how these disparate threads of story tie together, but we sense it is dangerous to follow them and that something, unrevealed, is just beyond our grasp. Chinatown succeeds because its mystery is actually mysterious, its story complex, its secrets genuinely surprising.<br />Finally, art direction, costuming and period detail in Chinatown is beautiful and meticulous.  And the music score is so good that it has been imitated many times in Chinatown wannabes.<br />There have been many attempts to emulate the quality of Chinatown, a few successfully (LA Confidential), many poorly (Mulholland Falls).  Chinatown is about as good as Hollywood can do, meeting both the obligations of entertainment while uniting and presenting the various craftsmanship of film-making at such a high standard that it raises the result to the level of art.<br />This unique confluence of story and talent occurs rarely, but when it clicks, as it did so brilliantly in Chinatown, the result is the masterpiece we all recognized from its initial release.  A timeless and indispensible film that would be diminished by any change or subtraction of any piece of its construct, this one should not be missed. A great film
B000006YYM|5.0|I love this album and consider it to be one of the best albums from one of the best bands ever, &quot;Gentle Giant&quot;.  I remember seeing them do some of the songs from this album live on Don Kirshners Rock Concert many, many years ago.  I had never heard of them before that but after seeing them I immediately went out and purchased this album afterwards.  The album describes the red tape of politics as well as the widening struggle between the classes.  Having played guitar since 1973, teaching myself how to read and write music and play classical guitar my sincere appreciation for the classical beauty that this band possesed has just grown.  Theres never been a band like this since and may never be another one this good again.
0689859368|5.0|I picked these up from our local bookstore in our mall yesturday and I knew I had to have them.  The minute I got home from running my errands and all, I went straight to reading.  Of course I start with the first so I know whats going on.  The authors do a great job with the childrens background and their paranoid mother. These are definatly a page turner and with 106 pages per a book (so far), I finished reading them in about 30-35 minutes.  The drawings are especially cute.  My favorite part was when Mallory put another hole into their kitchen wall to find that \\"squirrel\\" they have been looking for.  Pulling out all those weird things and then finding the dumbwaiter amd riding it up and up and up.  This story is great for kids... its not too long to make them disinterested and adults would love it too.  Move over Harry Potter , these get my vote.
0553583182|5.0|Murphy is well known for this classic work, and I can only recommend that this updated version of the classic is well worth the cost.<br />Anyone who enjoys self-improvement books, or who simply wants to maximise their potential should read this one.  I definately agree with the previous reviewers -- this book is a must have, and acts as an excellent stepping stone for anyone considering other types of mind dynamic courses, including Silva Methods.
0780626966|5.0|Movies:  Nightmare on Elm Street really was the launching pad for New Line Cinema.  Without Freddy, where would they be?  After the runaway success of the original Nightmare On Elm Street film, a sequel was pretty much guarenteed.  But what followed instead were SIX very popular sequels.  Some ranging from great (Dream Warriors, New Nightmare) to somewhere in-between (The Dream Master, The Dream Child) to not so good (Freddy's Revenge, Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.)  Freddy Kruegar started off as truly frightening in Nightmare On Elm Street.  Things took a slightly homoerotic turn in Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge.  Freddy did get back on track with Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors.  Freddy did turn slightly funnier, and more MTV-ish with Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master.  Then, Freddy did take a big fall with Nightmare On Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.  But he went way over the top with Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.  Wes Craven successfully made Freddy scary again in Wes Craven's New Nightmare.  The evolution that the series took was really interesting to watch, and quite enjoyable at times.  While not completely even, the series is pretty fun, nonetheless.<br />Nightare On Elm Street: 5/5<br />Freddy's Revenge: 3/5<br />Dream Warriors: 5/5<br />The Dream Master: 4/5<br />The Dream Child: 3.5/5<br />Freddy's Dead: 2.5/5<br />New Nightmare: 5/5<br />Extras: The boxed set has an entire eighth disc devoted to the special features.  There are really too many to list.  First, there's a &quot;Welcome To Primetime&quot; featurette, which goes into the making of the first film. Then, you can go into the Labyrinth, which is a really long and complicated maze to find the extras.  Or, you can go to the index to see most of, but not all the extras. All in all, a feature packed disc loaded with special features.   6/5<br />Overall: A great boxed set.  Not only do you get all of the movies, you gety an entire disc loaded with featuresto boot. Go, get this!
B00005JM1F|2.0|I gave this flick a chance because, hey, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrel, and Vince Vaughn are in it. With talent in this movie, I expected alot better. This movie, and Road Trip before it, are horribly directed and contain few laughs. Ferrel was by far the funniest part of this movie (fiery hoop, streaking, and tranq dart scenes.) The movie is pointless, but is a good popcorn movie. It really lacks on original jokes.
B00006IU73|3.0|Amazing how a the over abundance of terrible music available today can propel a slightly above mediocre album like In Absentia to &quot;Best of 2002&quot; status for many reviewers. To their credit Porcupine Tree does rise slightly above alot of the current bands but I don't judge music on what else is available currently. This music just doesn't have any staying power. It has some very nice moments interrupted by inappropriate power thrashing but it suffers from extremely weak lyrics and a general lack of innovation for the realm of music that PT has entered into. Some may say this review is way too harsh but until we the listeners begin to start expecting more from musicians we will be stuck with alot of forgettable music that takes us nowhere.
B0000931QR|5.0|Sometimes when music groups put out such a good album as \\"El Viaje de Copperpot\\" you're nervous on the next release because you're likely to be disappointed. Not the case with \\"Lo que te conte mientras te hacias la dormida\\" (translation: what I told you while you were faking you were asleep). What can I say, Amaia's voice is beautiful, and many of the songs have memorable choruses.  It's also one of those albums where you just start singing along. It doesn't have as much bass as the previous album (except for \\"Puedes contar conmigo\\"). As far as the songs, it's easier to mention the ones I didn't like that much, because most of them are fantastic. I usually skip \\"Geografia\\", \\"Un mundo mejor\\", \\"Vestido azul\\", \\"Adios\\", and \\"La paz de tus ojos\\".  Those five are ok songs, but the remaining ten songs are fabulous. That includes song number 15, a great dance tune that is not officially listed (sort of like \\"tic-toc\\" in the previous album). Don't miss this album.
B00004R7TP|5.0|I'm sorry, but how can anyone say that &quot;they don't like this album one bit?&quot;  Are you insane?!!  I'm sorry, but normally I try to respect other people's opinions, but this is just too much.  Hounds of Love has to be one of the best albums ever made!!  Every time that I hear &quot;You never understood me&quot; on The Big Sky, it makes me cry.  Enough said.....oh, and I'm a mess throughout the entire song of &quot;The Morning Fog.&quot;  Listen to it again because you are very wrong!!  That it has been almost ten years since her last album is a shame.
6305603847|5.0|Great movie, great music, nice to see the deleted scenes. The commentary track [stinks] but that's not why you buy movies anyway.
B000002J1Y|4.0|This is probably one of the most impressive live releases I've ever heard, especially considering the incredible complexity of Yes's corresponding studio material.<br />The first disc is take-it-or-leave-it, to be honest.  Why on Earth Yes included four minutes of their Firebird Suite intro escapes me, as they could have used that time for extra Yes music.  Steve Howe's intro to Siberian Khatru seems rushed and incomplete, but the rest of the song captures the intensity of the studio version.  Unlike many Yes fans, I don't care for Heart Of The Sunrise, but the Yessongs version probably won't disappoint if you do like it.  Perpetual Change drags on for nearly five minutes past its studio counterpart, and can get boring.  And although he's one of rock's best drummers, Bill Bruford's solo near the end of the song flops.  It seems as though he's just randomly banging his kit.  But the non-jam portion of the song is top notch.<br />And You And I does suffer from being an unapolagetically acoustic song performed with an electric guitar, but it is better than you might think.  The Preacher The Teacher section of the song comes across great.  Steve Howe's acoustic solo Mood For A Day contains extra emotion, as it's performed in front of an adoring audience.  Rick Wakeman's Six Wives excerpt may be a self-indulgent period piece, but it's an entertaining and impressive self-indulgent period piece.  Disc One comes to a close with a lively and intense performance of the classic Roundabout that suffers slightly from the lack of an acoustic guitar.  But it's enjoyable nonetheless.<br />Disc Two is what earns this album &quot;classic&quot; status.  I've Seen All Good People is so energetic and powerful that makes you want to get up to dance and play the air guitar!  Long Distance Runaround has a cool keyboard intro by Rick Wakeman that mimics Steve Howe's intro on the studio version.  As for The Fish, Chris Squire must be the only bassist alive that can take a nine-minute solo and make it powerful, electric, and memorable.  Yes's magnum opus Close To The Edge is performed here with a sense of urgency, power, and passion that is not evident on the studio version (although the studio version is 99% perfect).  Yours Is No Disgrace, like Perpetual Change before it, is greatly extended, but unlike Perpetual Change, it's exciting and lively.  Starship Trooper seems to suffer from some under-production and isn't perfect sound-quality-wise, but you'll put that in the back of your mind while listening to this quintessential Yes jam song.<br />As for the artwork/packaging, the Yessongs LP had some of the most impressive and awesome scenes created not only by Roger Dean, but by any artist ever.  Surprisingly, the artwork is reproduced relatively well in the CD edition despite being a small fraction of the size.<br />Yessongs is essential for any Yes fan (although they already know that) but is also essential for any fan of '70's hard rock and can serve as a great introduction to progressive rock's greatest artist.and make it powerful, electric, and memorable.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|I know that this film is hated by some people, but I don't care, I love this movie, for many reasons. The people that hate this movie say that is bad because it is vane, pretentious and over acted, well to me that's just stupid arguments, first of all, the film is not vane and empty, what about Tony's relationship with his sister, I thought that was very good. And also the statement made about the 80s, the hedonistic lifestyle that not just U.S.A but the world lead in that era, how many people like Tony threw their lives down the toilet by getting drunk, high, mixed up in crimes, and eventually killed. This movie has and extra meaning because of my country of birth and my age. I was born and still live in Colombia, and although I was a kid during the 80s, I still remember them and the legacy that still resonates in today's world. During the 80s my country was the birth place of many Tony Montana's, Colombia was THE drug country, and everyone here remembers the times of Pablo Escobar(the biggest drug lord ever, he was bigger than Al Capone) and so I think I like this movie so much is because the life style shown in Scarface was more common here than in the States, here we had very flashy and druglords that had over the top houses, cars, fashion and all of that, and they were famous, everybody knew of them and their lifestyle, and so I can relate very much to Scarface in the sense that I find it very believable. And I think Pacino acted wonderfully, because that was the behaviour of Colombia's drug lords, and  so to me he is not over acting. And if you don't believe any of the stuff I just said well then, the movie is also very entertaining, it has plebty of dark humour, action, suspense, drama, and a buch of other stuff. To sum up my review of the film itself, I think the statement made at the end is very powerful(THE WORLD IS YOURS), it show how the hedonistic and careless behavior of living in excess in every aspect lead to the tragic almost Hamlet like end for Tony Montana, every thing he cared and loved got killed, or abandoned him(his sister, his best friend, his wife, his mother, his mentor, etc.). The film has also a special charm, the 80s charm, I for one miss this era of bad taste and excess, I miss it's fashion, it's music, it's attitude(the world is yours), everything, here in Colombia the 80s were fantastic, because although the drug lords did all sorts of bad stuff, they were also beneficial in the sense that they helped our eceonomy and Colombia saw a huge economical boom because of their huge profits due to the eager drug markets from Europe and the United States, since the drug lords gave lot's of jobs to architects, construction workers, the scene in the movie in which Tony has a tiger in a small island in his huge mansion is great because that was the sort of stuff that drug lords had here(they had birthday parties for their kids in which they gave out t.vs, or beta sets, etc.), and also they had a lot of money, and the spend it in Colombia, so, even thought it was drug money, it was money, and economically speaking, when money is inserted into the circular money flow, the GDP of the country grew, and so Colombia grew and changed from a small banana republic, to a rather big and prosperous country due to drug lords, that finished when the country entered into a recession(a rather chaotic one in the 90s but that's a whole other story), so, as you can see, this is a topic in which I have a great knowledge and interest, and so, I love the movie, Pacino's passionate performance(with a funny accent), and lots of other stuff I have already said. <br />Now, speaking about the DVD, I love the fact that there will be a re-release of the movie, and the is called Anniversary Edition, which I hope that implies Special Edition, which implies the following I hope:2 or more discs, remastered sound and image, the film im just one disc, the special features in the other(unlike Gangs of N.Y), spanish subtitles in order for my non-english speaking relatives to watch, trailers, interviews with the cast, the director, the screenwritter and all, a commentary, documentaries and the drug cartels and the making of the movie, etc.<BR>I hope it is a great edition, I hope that the ones that are doing it take a lesson from great special editions like the Lord of the Rings Special Extended edition series, or the T2 special edition, or all the other great special editions, and that it is not just the movie and few to say the least additions, remember editions like the one of Apocalypse Now just to say one, it was junk, just the trailer, come on, the film is very good and it is still without extras worth buying, but come on, the DVD  is not just better sound and picture quality, is the possibility to get a broader look of the film and learn about many things that in the beta and the VHS era were impossible to learn. I am really looking forward to this film that appears that has gain greatness with time, and I hope that it will gain more greatness ans more time passes, like a good wine. Please believe me, \\"I always tell the truth, even whe I lie\\"-Tony Montana

0140143505|4.0|84 Charing Cross Road is a sentimental and heartwarming story of a woman's love of literature and deep and lasting friendship she made with people across the Atlantic. It is a correspondence between the author Helene Hanff, and her favorite book store, Marks and Company, located in London, England. Miss Hanff, who lived in New York, wrote letters to Marks and Company for a period of about twenty years, from 1949 to 1969. During this time she became a friend of the owner as well as the entire staff. Helene always wanted to go to England to see the bookstore, and meet the staff, but she never made it. It is an intriguing book because it shows us that prior to the invention of the internet and instant communication, people often had to communicate by letter which allowed for more personal contact, even over thousands of miles. It was a rewarding relationship on both sides. We learn that it is possible to form lasting and deep relationships with people that we have never physically met. This book should inspire others to start writing. How many of us remember how exciting it was to receive letters in the mail, or how we felt knowing that one we had written was flying or sailing across the sea.  I remember how excited I got as a child when I relieved a letter in the mail. Reading this book brought those memories back and made me want to start writing letters again.
B0000714BP|4.0|Some may say it's a 'Priscilla - Queen of the Desert' rip off, and indeed 'To Wong Foo...' shares a very similar story line to Priscilla (drag queens embark on a road trip) and whilst it lacks much of the wit and charm of Priscilla, there is no denying that 'To Wong Foo...' has its own very special charm and sparkle.<br />Revolving around three drag queens (played by Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo), who set off on a road trip to Hollywood California. Mishaps happen along the way and they become stuck in a small country town. <br />It seems that all is well with the country folk unsuspecting of their true identity. Not is all well though and the three drag queens turn the country town on its heels so everybody benefits. So you could call 'To Wong Foo...' a fable of sorts. It's unlikely that such a town would be so accepting of three outrageous drag queens, but if you suspend your belief in the realities of the harsh world for a moment this movie will give you a very special message.<br />Wonderful performances from the three leads, with Wesley Snipes being an eye opener as a flamboyant drag queen. We are so used to seeing him in masculine action movies and it's wonderful to see him flex another side of his acting muscle. For me though the standout is John Leguizamo. When adorned in full dress and make up he actually makes a convincing female. We have seem him portray a variety of roles over the years and 'To Wong Foo...' is another string to his bow. Shame he is so underrated in the movie world. <br />The picture quality on this DVD is clear and crisp and hard to fault. The vibrant colouring really brings out the bold strong hues of the costumes. Sadly the only special feature is a series of several deleted scenes. Interesting to watch, but I would liked to have seen more effort made with the special features.<br />It may not have the charm, wit or personality of Priscilla, but be rest assured that this movie is a wonderful fable of how acceptance and tolerance is a better way of life than hate and inequality.

B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves is one of those few special rock records that you should be arrested and incarcerated for not owning.  I'm serious.<br />Rush is more or less the smartest hard rock band to ever make music, and it's perfectly evident on here.  The Spirit Of Radio is a cynical and tounge-in-cheek (and accurate) observation of the corporate radio scene, and is ironically the most radio-friendly tune Rush put out up to that point.  Freewill includes some very clever lyrical wordplay (such as the famous line \\"if you choose not to decide / you still have made a choice\\"). It's also one of the heaviest songs Rush has ever done.<br />Jacob's Ladder is very ambiguous, mysterious and foreboding, both lyrically and musically.  It starts out with a neat and clean bass beat, and then Alex Lifeson adds a medieval-sounding guitar riff that Neil Peart complements with a steady, military-like drum beat.  It then jumps into a jam-based song that is never boring throughout its seven and a half minutes.<br />Entre Nous contains very intelligent and deep love lyrics courtesy of master wordsmith Peart.  I'm really surprised this song was never released as a single!  It could have been huge.  Different Strings is a gentle ballad with a rare songwriting credit to Geddy Lee.  It has a memorable acoustic guitar riff and a powerful piano part played by, of all people, Rush's album cover artist Hugh Syme.<br />Now we come to Natural Science.  Being as it's my favorite Rush song, it'll be hard to accurately appraise it, but I doubt anyone can find anything wrong with it.  In nine minutes it excites, awes, and pummels your eardrums with two headbanging riffs and two perfect guitar solos.  And not to mention the lyrics, which are some of the best Peart has ever penned (\\"Wave after wave / Will flow with the tide / And bury the world as it does / Tide after tide / Will flow and recede / Leaving life to go on as it was.\\"  *Wow.*)<br />I don't know what else to say about this album.  Everything about it is excellent.  Even the sound quality is perfect.  Get it now!bout it is excellent.  Even the sound quality is perfect.  Get it now!
B000075BFK|5.0|From buying this album, I have never took either disk 1 or 2 out of my cd player, it is amazing.<BR>Disk 1 is more 'rough'/'raw' but is great, my favourite on that cd are 'changed man', 'Momma's just a little girl' and 'Thugz Mansion', the whole 2pac version.<BR>CD 2 is completely different in style, but not quality. It's deeper, more thoughtful and brings light to more issues. It's a CD you can basically listen to for hours, and just think.<BR>The best ones on there are &quot;My Block rmx&quot;, &quot;The Life I lead&quot;, and &quot;Who do u believe in&quot;..to be honest the second CD appealed to me more, but they are both as good as each other.<br />I'de say if your a hardcore 2pac fan, it's a must, and if you're into rap music, but unsure or just do not listen to pac..it's worth buying it, if not to open your eyes to see how good he was, towards alot of others in contemporary rap.<br />BUY IT I TELLS YOU!<BR>L.<BR>England
B000096I9G|5.0|Concert videos are difficult to pull off, but this one works quite well.  The concept of playing three entire albums in a concert setting is somewhat unique and affords fans the opportunity to see and hear songs that they may not otherwise enjoy on the usual \\"album selling\\" tour.  The performances on this DVD make it evident that the Cure is still a viable and creative band.  We are privy to front row seats, backstage passes, and great sweeping views of the scenery that makes up the atmosphere of a live Cure concert.  <br />The recording is top notch.  If you have a good sound system, this may become your favorite concert DVD.  Most enjoyable, for me, was their amazing performance of \\"Disintegration.\\"  I've always wondered how they would pull that off live, but have never seen it until now.  I think this would be a great video for Cure fans and neophytes alike.  It definitely whets the appetite for the next Cure tour.
B000055WIQ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite horror movies. Everyone here does an excellant job. Ellen burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, and max von sydow just to name a few the whole cast was excellant. As was the direction, and the music.<BR>I went to the theater to see it when it was rereleased a few years back. and i was surprised when the theater was full. sevral people laughed a little halfway through(people dont know when to shut up) but by 30 minutes into the movie everyone shut up an did not say word until it was over. pretty good for a movie being 20 years old!<BR>one of my favorite scenes is when chris(ellen burstyn) comes home to a darkly lit house and checks on reagan(linda blair). several images flash across the screen and then theres the famous spider walk. I know for some people this is not an easy movie to watch but this is one of my favorites. see it!

Leaving out less important parts is necessary to plot movement, BUT why add something that never happened and detract from the strength of one of the better characters.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum were never taken to Osgiliath by Faramir.  Indeed, Faramir resisted any control of the Ringbearer and party because he knew neither he nor his father could be trusted with an item of such immense power. Other than that jarring note, the movie was incredible.
B000002KAT|5.0|There is nothing like &quot;Astral Weeks.&quot; In my opinion it is simply one of the most profound and unique recordings ever made. <br />The only &quot;hit&quot; from the album is &quot;Sweet Thing,&quot; which you may be familiar with if you have the greatest hits album. <br />The effect of the production on the album is incredible; the standup bass and the classical-like guitar mixed with blues vocals from some heavenly realm converge to create a celestial, eerie sound. Most of the songs are also very long, between seven and nine minutes, but believe me, they could go on forever (and in their own way, they do).After a few good listens, many of the songs on this album will be scrivened into your memory forever, playing the role of some kind of sweet nostalgia. <br />Truly one of the great albums of the sixties, and in my opinion, Van Morrison's best. Do not spend one more minute with this album not in your proximity, it becomes a true companion very quickly....
B00005JKJA|1.0|I loved this movie.  I saw it three times in the theater.  But this DVD redefines &quot;no frills&quot;.  No chapters, even!<br />This DVD is worth renting if you would like to see the movie, but buying it would be a waste of money.<br />It's sad that an innovator like David Lynch would fail to exploit the potential of the DVD medium and go all Luddite on us instead.

B00007BK2N|5.0|I've seen this movie twice and loved it.<br />Never knew much about Joy Division or beginning of rave in Manchester and it was great to see a team of people working together to do something in their local music scene that would also change the world. <br />It wasn't a bunch of businessmen but a bunch of people who loved music!
B00005JLET|5.0|This is the best movie iv'e ever seen and nothing can top it, ever. I saw the average rating, it was 4 stars and a half. That's nuts. This movie has the greatest art work, plot, characters and dialouge. This is simply the best. You have to give it 5 stars. I thank the director, Hayao Miyazaki for a wonderful experience in japanese animation.
B00003CXXP|1.0|The premise of this movie was quite good, which is obviously what compelled me to watch it in the first place.  It started out quite well also, and it had a lot of promise to it.  But there was just far too much that didn't need to be in the movie, and as a result, it dragged on and on.  I fell asleep halfway through the movie, and found myself waking up thinking, \\"It's still going?  Please God, make it stop!!\\"  I finished the movie, torturous as it was, because I really hate stopping a movie before the end, no matter how horrible it was.  But I will not be watching this again.
B000096FUD|3.0|***1/2 Thanks to DVD, weve all become accustomed to seeing inside documentaries about the making of some of our favorite films.  But what of those films that  for whatever reason  never end up seeing the light of day?  Are there any lessons to be learned from examining the making (or near making) of those works?  This is the questioned posed by Lost in La Mancha, a behind-the-scenes chronicle of director Terry Gilliams attempt to fulfill his decade-long dream of bringing Cervantes Don Quixote to the big screen, a project that ended up in heartbreaking, catastrophic failure for both the filmmaker and the gifted crew with which he was working.<br />Directors Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe did not, of course, set out to record such a debacle.  Like all the people involved in the making of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote  a film intended to star Jean Rochefort and Johnny Depp - the documentary filmmakers assumed that Gilliam and his crew would end up with an impressive finished product and that their own work would serve as little more than supplemental material on a future DVD release of the film, certainly not a theatrical release in its own right.  What none of them foresaw was the series of almost Biblical disasters that would ultimately doom the film to a state of perpetual nonexistence.  Flash floods, health problems, nervous investors and bottom line insurance agents all eventually conspired to prevent Gilliams dream from becoming a reality.  Thus, what became a bust for Terry Gilliam turned into a boon for Fulton and Pepe.<br />With the benefit of hindsight, the filmmakers ensure that the parallels between Don Quixote and Gilliam himself are never far from the viewers mind.  Gilliam, a maverick director whose movies have always tested the boundaries of the film medium, is clearly an artist and a visionary obsessed with impossible dreams of his own, but dreams that inspire those around him to strive for a greatness not always nurtured by the mundane realities of the everyday world.  The fact that, in this particular case, those realities intervened to bring his vision crashing back to earth only completes the connection to the Quixote figure.  Gilliam spends most of his time in this film tilting at his own windmills, only to find that the vagaries of fate are more terrifying than any giants Quixote might have imagined.  The documentary also notes that Gilliam is not the only major director to have been stymied in his attempt to adapt this material; the great Orson Welles failed to complete his version of Don Quixote as well.  The irony of these two innovative cinema giants both failing with THIS particular material pervades the film with an eerie sense of doom and foreboding.<br />Lost in La Mancha is an instructive film on a technical level, but also immensely sad on an emotional one.  Because we know from the beginning that this venture is doomed to failure, even the moments of hope and optimism early on in the film carry with them an air of fatalistic melancholy.  This pre-knowledge also turns the many admittedly humorous moments into genuine black comedy.<br /><br />It is always painful to see genius and creativity choked off at the root, especially since the few glimpses we get of actual completed footage hint at what a fine production this Don Quixote might have been.  As to Gilliam, one can only hope that he will continue to pursue his impossible dream despite all the roadblocks reality has set in his way.  Don Quixote would have wanted it that way.always nurtured by the mundane realities of the everyday world.

0460879146|5.0|Jane Austin is one of my favorite authors. I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is her best novel, with both \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" tied for second place. \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is an absolutely wonderful book, capturing beautifully the English Regency period's mores, manners, and lifestyles. The central theme deals with the extreme differences in temperaments between two sisters, and the eventual reconciliation and moderation of both their characters and temperaments.<br />Marianne Dashwood is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters, is much more practical and sensible. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Elinor does have a wonderful, dry sense of humor, and her witty comments enhance the novel. Throughout most of the narrative, Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. She is obviously judgmental concerning Elinor's reticence to freely express her emotions, and she also pities Elinor, for her perceived inadequacies. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.<br />The story opens with the death of Elinor and Marianne's father. He, unavoidably, has left them, along with their mother, (his second wife), and younger sister with little money. They are forced to leave their home, the Norland estate, and move to Barton Cottage, close to a distant relative's estate. Norland and all its treasures have been left to Dashwood's son, by his first wife. The four women have been left on their own, to pursue life, love, and loss in their different manners. <br />Both Elinor and Marianne fall deeply in love, while at Barton, and each, in turn, are disappointed by their choices. These devastating losses, plus their adjustments to an entirely different lifestyle, serve to modify their temperaments and change their lives.<br />\\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is a deeply moving novel, with biting satire, especially demonstrated in the characters of Fanny and John Dashwood, and Lucy Steele; and of course Elinor's fine wit adds much to make the reader smile. Ms. Austin's writing is pure elegance. Her female characters are well developed, including those in minor roles. The men, particularly John Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon are very different in nature, and not at all stereotypical. I loved the scenes at Barton Cottage with Marianne and Willoughby, and with Willoughby and the Dashwood family. I also really enjoyed the visit to London and the tragic ball scene.<br />I found myself laughing and crying while reading this book. So with all the discussion about moderation and passion, Jane Austin, once again, brought out the gamut of emotions in me. I cannot recommend this delightful novel highly enough!s estate.

B00005JM1Y|5.0|Johnny English is a great movie that all the family should enjoy. Although younger children might not get the more subtle jokes, anyone over the age of 8 is sure to be laughing their heads off at times. Rowan Atkinson does a great job at portraying a character who is not stupid, silly, or ignorent, but in his own league. English and his sidekick Bough (pronounced Boff) are a great time and are like the complete opposite of James Bond. This really made a good change from the pathetic slapstick comedies that we get too much of today. Instead of leaving the movie theatre feeling like you've wasted two hours, you will leave Johnny English after 90 minutes feeling in a great mood!
B00008GKEG|5.0|the production on this series in nothing short of incredible.  The &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; video is brilliant and seemless.  It is sad at times, but overall very uplifting.  I've never seen footage of Ringo singing live with the Beatles before I watched this.  There is all sorts of great footage that is never seen elsewhere.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is amazing! I'm in love with how great this disc is. It really shows how zeppelin really ruled the world back in the 70's. Don't listen to the reviewer who said that Jimmy page is \\"the most overrated guitarist\\" that's bull because Jimmy really is a guitar god and everybody knows it. Robert Plant shows how amazing and vocally talented he really is. The late John Bonham rules the drum with his \\"moby dick\\". And when you hear John Paul Jones' bass intro on \\"dazed and confused\\" you can't help but fall in love with led zeppelin. I totally recommend this dvd for zeppelin fans and even those who have not been exposed to how great zeppelin is. you won't be disappointed.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I cannot stress enough how much I love this movie! I have always enjoyed every part of it, from the music and special effects to the actors and everything in between. The acting is wonderful. From the first time I saw it I loved it and still continue to love it to this day! It is sad and romantic at the same time. It is very long, but it is still so good. I definitely recommend you see it if you haven't already; you will love it!
B00005JM09|4.0|I don't know how someone could really be upset by this entry in the terminator series.  The only things that I wish were different was the score.  It was horrible.  But Nick Stahl was phenomenal as John Connor.  Even though I liked him in the role more than I liked Edward Furlong, I still would've rather seen Eddie do it cuz he in my opinion is the real John Connor.  But Nick looks more like Michael Biehn (father from T1) so that was an advantage.  Kristanna Loken was extremely well cast as the Terminatrix, but she just couldn't be as fearsome as Robert Patrick (T-1000 from T2).  But I don't think anyone could've played it better.  Even though the ending cries out for a 4th film.  It really doesn't need it cuz everything is explained here.  But if they do decide to make it, please god have Arnie come back.  It's not Terminator without him.  To sum it up, \\"If a terminator film can be this good without James Cameron directing, imagine how good it could've been with him.\\"
B00008EY9G|5.0|Have you ever been to a movie theatre, watched a movie at home, heard a good song and every day that goes by, you still can't erase it from your memory?? If so, that is what makes a production a masterpiece and that is what IDENTITY did for me. I am an avid movie buff, see approximately 220 movies yearly and review them on my radio show and for some reason I can't escape this movie. IDENTITY was not supposed to happen to me. I went to the theatre on this day to see a different movie and it was full so I didn't want to just leave without seeing something and I noticed that this was the one movie about to start without me having to wait, so I indulged. There was not a moment in this movie that did not grab me and let go. I was thoroughly entertained, in that I laughed, cried, got angry and scared all in one sitting. I felt cold when all of the characters \\"disappeared\\" near the end and it sent me reeling, wondering what happened to everyone. I don't want to give it away to people who have not seen it but you should make it your MOVIE PRIORITY to support this feature either in theatres or when it releases to DVD. This is EASILY my pick of the best movie I've seen since SEVEN.
B000002U8A|5.0|I saw Duran Duran live at the Roxy this week, and though they didn't play any songs off this album, they still ROCKED!!  &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; is everything you want in a pop album: great vocals, smart lyrics, awesome guitars.  This album is even better than the overrated &quot;Born in the USA&quot; by Bruce Springsteen, who isn't anywhere near as talented as Simon LeBon and Nick Rhodes.  Duran Duran are awesome and I really love this album!!

B00004LN16|5.0|Good, simple Hard Rock 'N' Roll album from this down-to-earth band.No updates,no uplifts,no progression,no B.S.! This album/CD falls more into a &quot;blues-groove&quot; than any other they have made. If you want head-smashing headbanging I'd recommend older CDs/cassettes. This album is proof AC/DC are the &quot;kings of groove.&quot; People that bad-mouth it don't bother me since AC/DC has always been a band of/for outsiders(that happens to sell MASSIVE-amounts of CDS!). This is simple blues-based Rock 'N' Roll with Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed,Jerry Lee Lewis influence all over it. It is enjoyable to me, a long-time fan. Listen to it before buying, as the tunes may not be what you expect from AC/DC; it is more &quot;toe-tapper&quot; then &quot;head-smasher,&quot; but is still &quot;tough.&quot;

Peter Jackson struck gold in the second installment of The Lord of the Rings. Helm's Deep is an amazing action sequence that stunned me and everyone in the theater! It's a visual epic that ends with the viewer wanting to know who \\"she\\" is. ;) \\"Yes, she will do it...\\" Just pre-order and find out what I am talking about... It left me in so much wonder that I had to buy the books and figure out who she was. Great books, lovely movies!<br />Believe me when I say we are in for an even BIGGER ride when The Return of the King is released...<br />This is a must for anyone's DVD collection! Pre-order it now!<BR>If you saw the movie and you didn't like it (is that possible?) The Return of the King preview is well worth it!<br />THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE-EARTH IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!
B00000I1IE|5.0|This wonderful video (as states) does capture the triumph of the human spirit! The video is very inspirational to me! Tim Robbins teaches us a story by acting in a role with such expertise, we can see in oursevles that we also have the capablity to beat all odds. Morgan Freeman shows us that through paitence, we can make the best of any situation. I don't usually like Stephen King. This video based on a Stephen King story is the best!
0553108034|5.0|The best fantasy novel I have ever read.  This book brings the characters to life and makes them a real as any one I know.  I have read the first three books and have hooked most of my family and half my friends on the series.  We are all eagerly awaiting the publishing of A Feast for Crows.  Whenever I talk with my family we can't help to have a discussion about these books or speculate on what Mr. Martin has in store for us all.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I must confess I've heard of Alison Kraus but never heard her music for more than a few minutes. I'd come across her on Austin City Limits while channel surfing and that's been the extent of it.<br />Along came the Second Gulf War. While stationed here in Iraq the Post Exchange makes available cds. I found myself starved for some new music, hence my purchase of Alison Kraus. What a great find!<br />I've enjoyed this cd for the last two weeks. Both her voice and the excellence of the accompanying musicians are excellent as are the song choices. She's certainly won another fan and when I return stateside I'll track down her earlier works.

0393312836|5.0|It's to Burgess' credit that he makes the protaganist of Clockwork Orange an unsympathetic character and the state's attempt to &quot;adjust&quot; him an almost worthwhile achievement. Burgess makes the typical black and white judgements more difficult for us.<br />But Clockwork Orange's genius is more than this. Burgess injects Russian words into his gang of toughs creating a lower class dialect . Knowing Russian makes the book much easier to read yet defeats the authors purpose- he wants the reader to determine the word meanings by context.<br />Clockwork Orange is a darkly comic work that stands as one of the best books of the twentieth century.

038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is Vonnegut at his best. The irreverence, flippancy and zaniness of his characters (and writing) mask deeper questions of religion and the nature of human faults.<br />In answer to Christianity and all religions one of Vonnegut's characters creates his own and falls prey to it. Bokononism is one of the great and funny creations of late 20th century literature. It's founder is one of the main characters within Cat's Cradle and never makes a real appearance until the last page and only then to deliver a message to &quot;Jonah&quot;.<br />Vonnegut risked getting out of control in this novel, but somehow he's able to balance everthing, keep the reader involved and make a statement. Unlike other &quot;hip&quot; novels of the '60s, Cat's Cradle holds up well in our decade.
0691023565|4.0|There seems to be a cultish following for Polya's book, so I decided to pick it up even though I'm not a mathematician. I'm a philosophy PhD with an interest in &quot;business strategy&quot; (as they call it). The book's a little bit tough to move through, since he chose to write it as a glossary for the bulk of the text. That makes it boring. The more fundamental issue of course is that he's thinking about math when he gives his ideas for solving problems, and more specifically about TEACHING kids to solve math problems. Now, this is useful. And the general tenor is applicable to all kinds of problem solving. But I think it's not the holy grail it's meant to be -- there are other books on problem solving that make more practical sense if you are working on non-formal mathematical puzzles.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Benefit is, in my opinion, one of Tull's best albums. This is progressive rock a-la Tull without the later foray's into concept albums. And it works wonderfully.<br />Listening to it again all these years later I'm remain fascinated at what a good band they were before the break-out. To me this is some of Tull at their best- experimenting but remaining within a conventional format. Benefit remains, for me, one of my favorite Jethro Tull albums.
0446364495|1.0|I read this book at the recommendation of a very bright friend.  I was skeptical initially because this is not the type of book I would typically read.  I wanted to appreciate the book because I trust the judgment and intelligence of the person who recommended it.  What I found was a grossly amateurish, intellectually pretentious, and stunningly manipulative piece of drivel.  I absolutely hated this book, particularly because of obvious attempts at using emotionally loaded language to appeal to those with Emma Bovary Syndrome - an insistence on believing that somehow infatuation and projection are the &quot;real&quot; basis of love between two adult human beings. This is not good thinking, it is not good writing, and it is certainly not good literature.  Save your time and your money.
B00008WG3U|1.0|this cd is terrible, i have no idea what happened, nofx used to be so good up until pump up the valuum and then this, the only songs worth listening to are franco-un american and the idiots are taking over
0783225903|5.0|This is possibly the most wildly creative film ever done with the technical and financial backing (although Terry Gilliam had a hellish time getting the timid, unimaginative hacks at the studio to release it once they saw the finished product) of a major studio. Imagine George Orwell and Salvadore Dali trying -- and succeeding -- at being funny and making a movie together. A really wicked satire to boot!
B00005JLXE|3.0|Cracking comic book adaption with a hilarious performance from Colin Farrel. Allegedly based on Alex from 'A Clockwork Orange' crossed with Sid Vicious, his Bullseye actually reminds you of Bob Goldthwait's Zed from the 'Police Academy' series. His special features contributions are delightfully incomprehensible, too. Ben Affleck is at his least irritating as well. Photography is excellent. This was obviously a labour of love for the director. Nothing much to feed the brain but for once I wouldn't have minded a sequel.
B000089RVX|5.0|I got the fallen cd a few days after it came out, before they started playing BMTL on the radio all the time. I must say... WOW. This probably one of the best bands I've seen and heard in a long long time. Amy Lee is a phenominal vocalist and its beyond obvious. Even live, Evanescence is spectacular to watch and all of its members prove to be very talented. While they are much heavier live, I would not recomend them to somebody who is into super heavy-hardcore music, they just aren't like that. But anyone who likes rock or nu-metal I'd say go for it. <BR>  Going Under- An awesome track! A great way to start the album off. It starts with harsh vocals from Amy and quickly switches to sweet and beautiful and then back again. The video for this one is also great.<BR>  Bring Me To Life- Probably the most common track people know from Evanescence. Its been on the radio on almost every station I've heard. The only track on the album with a male vocalist.<BR>  Everybody's fool- I find this one really catchy for some reason. I think its an issue most people can relate to as well.<BR>  Immortal- One of my favorite tracks on the album. It features Amy's beautiful singing and great piano playing. Its probably one of the slowest tracks on the album but definetly good enough to compare to the rest of the tracks.<BR>  Haunted- I like parts of this track but its not my favorite. Really a great track though nonetheless. Its really eerie and creepy like in the beginning. Amy sings it wonderfully as usual.<BR>  Tourniquet- Possibly my favorite on the album. Its a song about suicide. Its really catchy and you'll find yourself listening to it again and again. I like the guitar in the beginning too.<BR>  Imaginary- Beautiful strings parts through out the song. I must say I love the lyrics and just the melody all together.<BR>  Taking over me- I like the vocals in this song a lot. I just don't think the lyrics were as well thought out as some of the other songs. Nice melody to it as well.<BR>  Hello- Brilliant piano throughout the song. The song moves a little slow for my tastes. Spectacular vocals throughout the song. <BR>  My last breath- Beautiful vocals that go along with the lyrics very nicely. I just love hearing amys voice in this song...<BR>  Whisper- I love the beginning of this song... but I'm not so sure about the ending. The music in the beginning is great. Amy sounds lost and confused in the vocals making it easy for them to relate to the lyrics. I love how the chorus vocals kind of crossfade eachother in a way. I didn't like how at the end the chants just kind of faded away... what were they saying anyway? I never did figure that out. Truly a great song, but I liked the Origin version better.<BR>  Now you have heard my review so please go and BUY THE CD!!
B0000640S1|2.0|But which guy? He must be caught and punished. But seriously, the director knows how to keep a story moving and Stallone's sympathetic (if over-acted) performance helps but when his character says &quot;let it go, or I'll give you a war you won't believe&quot;, THE END should have come up on the screen. A nice little 45 minute movie ending satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the film goes on and a man in a grey overcoat and silly beret shows up with a pair of water skis and a rubber shark. This toe curlingly cheesy performance ends with one of the most embarrassing moments in film history. &quot;Don't do it, Rambo!&quot; Yells the afore-mentioned Colonel. Indeed, John, don't waste your bullets on Brian Dennehey, whose rather a good actor. Aim it where it counts. The man is destined to get you into more mischief anyway.<br />Meanwhile, back at the ranch....(what's left of it.)
B00009XITP|2.0|This cotton candy chick-flick falls squarely into the \\"creampuff teen movie\\" stereotype. If you are over 13 years of age and carry XY chromosomes, following are some hints to bear this movie:<br />(1) Get loads of popcorn, and coke. May be a dozen chocolate bars too. You'll have ample time.<br />(2) Don't expect anything UNpredictable. Every conceivable teen cliche is thrown in -- eye-hurting floral gowns, those pesky female shrieks, all-muscle-no-brain deluge of boys, tiaras, father's undying love, a hep mom, tattoos, tongue piercings, staid rock, and attention grabbing antics. Not even the soundtrack escapes cliche for that matter, expect a priceless gem from The Donnas.<br />(3) Prepare NOT to be the least bit peeved at Gordon's doozy portrayal of the British, who are all made to look like sniveling morons without any trace of heart. (How niche can your audience get?)<br />SAVING GRACE:<br />Colin Firth (but then you knew that).<br />FINAL RECOMMENDATION:<br />If you really must watch it against your will, cast your twit filter far away.
B00000GUZP|5.0|I bought this in 1981 and own the LP,Cassette, Australian cd, Uk Cd and the US cd.

They came off of their huge hit Diana for Ms. Ross. The collection had 2 hits off of it-\\"Backfired\\" #43 pop,71 R&B and 29 club chart and the more Blondie type song \\"The Jam Was Moving\\" which got to #82 pop. The album got to 25 and went gold but was a bigger hit in the UK where it got to number 6. The album was written by Debbie,Chris Stein,Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards in that you couldn't tell who wrote what because most of the Chic written songs sound like they were written by Debbie and Chris and the Harry/Stein songs sound like Chic written songs. Both parties studied each other very well. The cd begins with \\"Jump Jump\\" a little song about a dog being forced to be on show- probably a metaphor to being a famous celeb. To me the best songs on here are \\"Chrome\\" which was released as a promo single,\\"Under Arrest\\",\\"Military Rap\\",\\"Now I Know You Know\\"-which was the second video release directed by H.R. Giger,\\"Surrender\\"-the most Chic sounding song on the collection and \\"Inner City Spillover\\" which was a 12\\" mix on the b side of the UK 12\\" single of \\"The Jam Was Moving\\". This was a brave move on the part of Debbie Harry in that she tried to further her move into rap with \\"Backfired\\" and tried not to only do more Blondie type songs but just did stuff she wanted to do. This is typical of her solo stuff in that she tried and do the type of songs and styles she wanted to do. Most people rememeber this collection for the cover art-which is considered one of the greatest of all time but the music stands up too. Just a funny collection of funky tunes from Debbie Harry and Chic. Love the Tony Thompson drums!!!!!
B0000025KI|5.0|The River made Springsteen a superstar just as his political alter ego, Ronald Reagan, closed the deal with a disturbingly large percentage of the American electorate. The Boss and Gipper were both charmingly retrogressive, unequaled in their ability to make the old and forgotten seem new and essential. Reagan reached back to Calvin Coolidge and the Gilded Age; Springsteen, to the Drifters, Phil Spector, the Searchers and Eddie Cochran. But while Reagan hawked false optimism, Springsteen finally embraced punk pessimism, imagining characters who dreaded rather than dreamed of the future. From the deceptively cheery \\"Sherry Darling\\" to the bleak \\"Point Blank,\\" failure and futility dammed The River's flow. The story begun with Born to Run and continued with Darkness on the Edge of Town ended here in doubt and the faded light of unhappy memories. So why the triple platinum success? Because Springsteen and the E Street Band conjured a rich and glistening sound that reminded me, as nothing had in years, of why kids loved rock 'n' roll in the first place. A record of its time, steeped in the past and capable of holding up long into the future.
B00005JM09|5.0|First of the \\"I hate cash ins\\" is a complete idiot when it comes to movies.  He doesn't take in to thought that the movies change to stir up the audiance and mix a plot.  Also he needs to watch the series a few hundred times just to get a clue on what the teminator series is about and how the storyline goes.  I thought the movie kick off with a bang and never letting off till the end.  would suggest this film to anyone who enjoys movies to sit back and have a great time watching, because you are going to.
0385504209|2.0|A convoluted and improbable plot, one-dimensional characters speaking in stilted run-on sentences, and turgid, repetitive descriptive passages characterize Dan Brown's best-seller, &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;<br />Compared to the work of more competent practitioners of the art of the globe-hopping action/adventure/mystery novel - Michael Crichton comes to mind -  Brown's work is pedestrian and overwrought.  Although prolix - the book is about 100 pages too long - the author fails to create adequate descriptions of people, or places, or objects.  After 450 some pages, the reader still has gotten few clues about matters so basic as the physical appearance of the principal characters - other than hair color!<br />Descriptions of places - the Louvre, Westminster Abbey - are lifeless, and read as if written by one of the less gifted of Mr. Brown's former prep school students.<br />The success of the book must be attributed to the publisher's (Doubleday) unprecedented marketing effort - distributing 10,000 advance copies of the book to booksellers and the media, and putting Mr. Brown - who had never before sold more than a few thousand copies of his earlier efforts - on extended publicity road trips to trade shows and booksellers.<br />If you're looking for an intellectually challenging mystery story, reread Eco's &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, or &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot;.  For more vivid descriptions of people and places and events in an atmosphere of mystery, read Crichton, or Ian Fleming - or even Tom Clancy!<br />For an example of how marketing hype can overcome critical judgment and influence popular taste, read &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.
0375707972|4.0|I picked this book up without knowing much about it, and read it on an airplane.  It would be remarkable if it was a true story, but as a fictional novel one has to wonder about the motivation.  That said, the story itself starts slowly and is perhaps overly done in regards to the sexual relationship between a young man and a much older woman.  On a couple of occasions I just about put the book down in the first third as the story was choppy and seemed to be a sensationalized fantasy of a male teen-ager, but was glad I didn't drop the story there.<br />The emotion evoked in the last several chapters is so vivid one can feel it long after the book is over.  The sense of loss, the emptiness of change and the confusion between morality and personal attachment is explored quite deeply.  I think that perhaps what makes the story compelling, and sometimes a bit frustrating, is the perspective of the main character.  We are let in as if it is being told in the first person, but either the central character is a person who has difficulty accepting and processing reality, or the audience is only let in so far.<br />In the end, this is a story about expectations, and the loss that comes with change. It is about the moments in time when reality in the present comes face to face with our memories and our held beliefs about situations and people.  The result is always bittersweet and vividly powerful.  A good read, and a moving story.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is, in my opinion, THE best rap album ever!<br />Everything about it is good: although the beats are contravertial (i think they're brilliant), the tunes and especially the lryics are not questionable whatsoever, he is a great lyricist and he has REAL issues to talk about, unlike wack rappers who are only in it for the fame.  <br />Nas is absolutely amazing on this album. With songs like 'New York State Of Mind' and 'Halftime', how can anyone argue that nas is wack?<br />The only bad thing is that since 'Illmatic', i dont think Nas has lived up to the standard he set when he made is debut.<br />Anyway, i cant stress how good this album is, its one of those 'see for yourself' things....I strongly urge you to buy this album!!
0375703764|5.0|I first discovered this book about two years ago. I was interested in it because I owned the Poe album \\"Haunted\\" and a friend who also had that C.D. recommended the book. I didn't realize the impact it would have on my own mind.<br />The story starts out slowly and simply with straightforward narratives and normal looking pages. As the story progresses, the writing, both style and layout, become more complex and confused. You find yourself unwilling to put the book down, frantically flipping through the short pages, your heart racing with fear for the explorers. This novel sucks you in and won't let go. You become aware of the dark places in your own life and, like Johnny Truant, you spend more and more time contemplating the meanings behind the text. So many emotional and intellectual issues are tied up in an insane bundle that you find it hard to disentangle yourself. Only you don't really want to. The darkness begins to swallow you and you can only wish it would happen faster so you can understand what is happening. This book is all about the darkness that permeates our lives and souls.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This CD is worth it solely for the blatant Blondie Ripoff Rap in American Life.  I laughed so hard I cried!  <br />\\"I'm drinking a Soy Latte... it goes into my bott-tay (body)...\\" <br />\\"I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling SUPER-DOOPER!\\" <br />This CD reminds me of an pocket-warm M&M candy. Shiny tough exterior and sticky sweet on the inside.  The hype for this CD  suggested subject matter of great depth. Actually, it reveals a false front for an empty glossy production that holds the depth of a pinball machine! Let us never mistaken this Madonna/Mirwais production as Friedrich Nietzsche or even Oscar Wilde -- for crying out loud!  This is POP MUSIC! This is a joke-shop trip showing the satirical beauty of the absence of substance. Enjoy the mental picture of Ms. Madge chanting away to the burps and blips and chugs of the Mirwais pinball game.  It's an virtual arcade of epic (or perhaps biblical -- Madonna, get it! PUNNY!) proportions.<br />So HAVE FUN! Buy this for its bizarre sound effects and its sheer MINDLESS FUN aspect...<br />HOWEVER.....................<br />If you're looking for flawless mature song-writing, beautiful orchestrations, and gorgeous production -- check out Aimee Mann's last two albums instead.
0694526088|5.0|Clearly this is groundbreaking work that starts with data to understand how some companies excel as represented by their stock market valuation. Unlike many other management guides, it does not find data (or worse, anecdotes) to support a theme or set of truths. Collins derived his principles from analyzing and observing the data.<br />Many other reviews point out the high quality of the research and analysis that went into this book. It exemplifies thoughtful assessment of a lot of information. I will not try to recreate Collins' keys points as other reviewers have.<br />However, I want to highlight a critical point that he makes in the introduction: The traits Collins identifies for &quot;good to great&quot; companies are not necessarily prescriptive. That is, he is not asserting that when you apply these principles you will necessarily produce a great company.<br />This is an extremely important point when you begin to apply the principles. One must be very careful to understand how to follow his guidance should you be in a position to effect change in a company.<br />I witnessed a consultant applying the first step, select the right people, way too quickly with a client. They were oblivious of the organization's social and cultural limits and strongly advised radical change in the management team. They were using the &quot;good to great&quot; principle to justify the removal of people who they thought were not &quot;top notch&quot; managers. Using Collins to support this action may not produce success and in this case could destroy the organization before they could begin to apply the other &quot;good to Great&quot; principles.<br />No doubt intelligently using the guidance offered by Collins will help move an organization to higher performance. It is nice to have quality data and insight to support these principles.<br />Perhaps, the traits of &quot;good to great&quot; companies are best used for predicting the valuation trend of individual companies.  If you can actually get this type of information on a company, you might feel safer putting your money in its stock.<br />All in all, I would like to see more business texts use Collins'     analytical approach.
B000092ZYY|1.0|In comparison to all other radiohead albums, this one is by-far the most uninspirational.  The songs just come at you one after another, seemingly pulled out of the hat.  The idea to rely on the live audience as a determining factor of which songs to run with (salamanca spain, et al.), is a bad one, primarily because it turns an album into a collection of &quot;best of&quot; moments not unlike &quot;america's funniest home videos.&quot;  This democratic ideal has weakened the end-product.  In their attempts to make it as pleasing as possible to everyone, radiohead missed the opportunity to run with their momentum after their excellent five-star hat-trick: ok computer, kid a and amnesiac.   I haven't lost faith in them yet, of course, its only one dud in a sea of brilliance.
6304779356|5.0|Hey, I like this movie, too, but no review of this film is really complete without mentioning the dorky, embarassing '80s New Wave fashion disasters, from Corey's outlandish, eye-bruising &quot;Miami Vice&quot; vest, to the bad boy leathers on Kiefer &amp; Co.  A fun vampire movie, yes, but also a hilarious pop culture time capsule.
0345442970|3.0|This is a good book that deals a lot with political intrigue. While I liked it, I found it a bit plodding and slow at times. A true fan will suffer through the slow spots. However, it does give a great insight to the Trade Federation and explains why the political scene is the way it is in Episode 1. Definately worth checking out!
0393057658|1.0|The most important number in baseball is World series won. How many does Beane have...none. He hasnt even made it to the pennant games yet and they way things are going the A's never will if Beane is the GM. Thier window of oppurtunity passed when the &quot;overpaid&quot; and slick fielding (which doesnt matter to Beane) Derek Jeter threw out the overweight and slow Jer. Giambi at the plate on a great play in 2001. The As would be bottom rung if not the the 3 hammers they have in the rotation, non of whom were picked out of the crowd by Beane. Everyone knew that Hudson, Zito and Mulder would be very good. Groupthink has obviously taken a hold of most of the reviewers, who all seem to say the same things. &quot;OBP is important, Ks are important, not making an out blah blah&quot;  and so on as if everyone in the baseball world doesnt know that. Looks like Beane pulled another fast one on all the people who rushed and bought his book.
B000001ELR|5.0|Heavy is the only way to describe this album.  After three albums that saw Kiss soften their sound they came back with their hardest offering ever.  This album saw the introduction of Vinnie Vincent (although it's not credited) and the fresh talent shows. Here it is track by track.<BR>1. Creatures of the Night: Paul opens the album with a fast paced in your face rocker.  Opening with a vicious drum fill it melts your skull for four relentless minutes.  Cool lyrics. A classic.<BR>2. Saint and Sinner: Gene continues with this number.  Cool, midpaced tune with catchy vocal arrangements and cool guitar licks. Dark and heavy.<BR>3. Keep Me Comin': Another by Paul, whose tunes are generally upbeat on this offering.  Cool slinky verse riff with a chunky breakdown and lude lyrics.  Kiss all the way.<BR>4. Rock and Roll Hell: A killer Simmons song.  About the life of a rock and roller.  Pulsing bass line gives the tune a brooding feel. More darkness from Gene.<BR>5. Danger: This song rules! Stanley sings/screams his lungs out, especially on the chorus \\"Give me Danger, Danger...\\" Jammin'.<BR>6. I Love it Loud: The title says it all! Loud and in your face. Simmons wrote the hit of the album.  The drums make this song with their infectious beat and heavy production.  Eric Carr was great...the chorus will be burned in your head forever \\"Loud, I wanna hear it loud, right between the eyes...\\"<BR>7. I Still Love You: The albums only ballad yet it doesn't bring down the pace.  Simple but full of emotion and feel.  Paul best ballad. Period.<BR>8. Killer: Vicious Simmons song about an abrasive woman.  The riff is pure metal and the lyrics are venomous.  Almost too heavy to be Kiss. Kool!<BR>9. War Machine: Simmons closes with a classic.  Heavy as an elephant and you can't help but sing along to the chorus.  So heavy that a death metal band did a cover of it!!!<BR>That is it.  Not one bad song in the lot. Buy the album, bang your head and listen to it LOUD!!!
B00008RH3L|5.0|Miller's Crossing was released in 1990.  It was a modest success and was relatively well received by critics. I saw the movie when it came out and liked it but thought it was nothing special. Repeated viewings on home video have made me change my opinion; it is now one of my favorite films.  <br />Albert Finney is Leo, an Irish mob boss in an unnamed Eastern city during prohibition. Gabriel Byrne is Tom, his right hand man, a drunk and a compulsive gambler. Jon Polito is Caspar, a lesser mobster who comes to Finney  to get permission to kill Bernie Birnbaum (played by John Turturro), a bookie who has been profiting from information about boxing matches fixed by Polito. Finney refuses, saying to Polito that Turturro pays him protection money just like he does. In reality, Finney doesn't want to harm Turturro because he's romantically involved with the bookmaker's sister, played by Marcia Gay Harden.<br />The performances by the leads are excellent. Albert Finney and Gabriel Byrne are superb. Jon Polito is fantastic in every scene he appears. There is an unforgettable assassination-attempt scene where Albert Finney jumps out of a second floor window and then lets his Thompson submachine gun do his talking for him. I originally thought that Turturro's perfomance was more annoying than anything else, but even that has grown on me. It's said that an actor making you dislike his character is a sign of the excellence of the protrayal. The newly released DVD is fine and the sound quality is noticeably better than the tape. There is unfortunately no director's commentary track, a inexplicable major fault. The documentary interviewing cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld somewhat makes up for this. In this documentary Sonnenfeld says that Turturro told him that he based  his performance as a whiny double-dealing homosexual Jew on his observations of Sonnenfeld on the set.  The movie has a polished yet artificial look that is somehow wholly appropriate. Just like a Shakespeare play, despite the fact that you can never forget that you are watching actors emoting on a  (sound)stage, the writing and the performances are so good that it doesn't matter.
B000087OR2|5.0|I am completely enthralled with the music that Norah and her fellow band members have been turning out, but why weren't these tracks included on the US release (i.e., at home) as well instead of halfway around the world?  Now I have to buy the album twice!
0375703764|5.0|at first the book seems unreadable.  but if you stick it out the first capter, it becomes really easy to get into the flow.  i have read the book four times now and every time i take something new away form the book.
B00004LN16|5.0|The plain and simple facts are... 1. this band has topped over 140 million album sales... 2. people like their songs, and sometimes do not wish to see a band change their ways, the number of albums sold, obviously shows they are doing something right... 3. everyone is entitled to their opinion, if you don't like this music, then don't listen to it, if we had all the same music wouldn't that be boring??? 4. This album IS the best since Back In Black... 5. Brian Johnson is gettin' old, we can't expect him to sound young all the time, so leave his vocals alone... i'm just glad we still have bands like these, and every other true fan of heavy metal rock and roll should be aswell! THANK YOU AC/DC
B00007ELEL|5.0|I really think this is the best comedy the brothers have done yet. Jeff Bridges is great, but John Goodman steals the show.
B000002GQH|5.0|With their third album, 1969's &quot;On The Threshold Of A Dream,&quot; the Moody Blues shifted gears once more, going from the psychedelic sounds of &quot;In Search Of The Lost Chord&quot; to a more cosmic, spacey, otherworldy feel. The end result is another classic Moodies album, with everyone in the band contributing excellent tracks. Drummer Graeme Edge's strong spoken-word intro, &quot;In The Beginning,&quot; along with it's spooky keyboard lead-in &amp; clock sound effects, instantly sets the mood. Guitarist Justin Hayward's &quot;Lovely To See You&quot; is a classic melodic rocker (and the band have used it to open many of their concerts). Flautist Ray Thomas' slow-shuffler &quot;Dear Diary&quot; is a memorable gem, one of Ray's finest compositions. Bassist John Lodge hands in a fine pair with the country-flavored atmospheres of &quot;Send Me No Wine&quot; and the rockin' &quot;To Share Our Love,&quot; and keyboardist Mike Pinder's seductive &quot;So Deep Within You&quot; is one of *his* best contributions to the Moodies, and a mighty powerful song. Hayward's &quot;Never Comes The Day&quot; is a gorgeous ballad, Thomas' &quot;Lazy Day&quot; has an endearing childlike quality to it, and Hayward's &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot; is another luscious, dreamy song. Finally, after Edge's fine poetry of &quot;The Dream,&quot; comes Pinder's astonishing, classic mini-epic of &quot;Have You Heard (Part One)/The Voyage/Have You Heard (Part Two),&quot; an amazing, heavenly journey into cosmic rock. The band sound fantastic on this album, and there's not a dull track anywhere. With &quot;On The Threshold Of A Dream,&quot; the Moody Blues deliver another progressive rock classic.
B00005JLYU|3.0|Yeah, it's mindless, loud, excessive, gratuitous, and even flawed -- but who cares? I've seen this film twice, and it hasn't yet kept a smile off my face. Mind you, I'm not usually entertained by this sort of... stuff. I'm more of an avid watcher of the Sundance and Independent Film Channel, than HBO, Showtime, and Starz. Why, I ask, should I feel guilty about a film that makes me feel this giddy -- critically panned or not -- I just don't know.<br />Part of the movie's charm lies in the performances by the three Angels. No, they don't give any Oscar-worthy perfs. But for a sequel -- a sequel destined for negative reviews from high-minded critics -- Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz, perform with the abandone of child actors unaware of silly movie business things, like critics and box-office. Whose only inspiration for performing in this franchise, anyway, is just to have a good ol' time.<br />And in having such a good ol' time, the Angels celebrate girl power, by using their sex appeal as a weapon to deter guys too horny to learn of their schemes. But at the same time as they are proving women's superiority over men, they're giving their libido's a treat. There's a sequence late in the film when the Angels perform as Pussycat Dolls. And despite the limitations of the PG-13 rating, it's easily the sexiest scene in a film starring sexy women, directed by a filmmaker who acknowledges their sex-appeal, and exploits it.<br />While the film contains a great amount of action sequences, the movie never asks that you feel danger for the well-being of the characters. You know none of them will die, let alone get a scratch. The purpose of the action scenes, it seems, is simply that you awe at the rediculousness of it all (and if you aren't humored by the film's first action sequence, then you might as well just walk out).<br />There have been criticisms pointed at the film for ripping-off the gravity-defying fighting scenes of The Matrix for superficial reasons. But Angels is more homage, or parody, than a rip-off that asks you to take it seriously. Too much of what occurs in this movie would most certainly not happen in reality. But these are Angels, after all. And first and foremost, they're characters of a fictional film. Who says their actions have to obey by the laws of reality? Watch a Dogme film for that.<br />But if the excessiveness and implausibility of the action scenes don't tickle your funny bone, then maybe Bernie Mac will, who is my favorite comedian working today. At first, he seemed to be overwhelmed by the presence of the gorgeous Angels. But upon second view, I found him funnier and a lot more relaxed. However, the funniest bits of the film surprisingly come from an actor who may or may not be reaching for laughs.<br />Justin Theroux, of David Lynch's Mulholland Dr., plays the ex-lover of Barrymore's character. He's got a thick Irish accent that is one of the funniest things I've ever heard. And when he says, \\"Give us the rings,\\" I couldn't stop lauging. He's also got a physique that is too exaggerated in its chisledness to not be humorous.<br />I Don't Wanna Grow Up, I'm a Charlie's Angel<BR>Speaking of adolescence, there's a bit of business in the film about the Angels fearing the actual entrance into adulthood. Barrymore's character suspects that Diaz's boyfriend, played by Luke Wilson, is going to ask her to marry him. After which, Barrymore daydreams of the Angels gradually breaking up, and -- whatdoyahknow -- eventually growing old. There's also a scene between Liu and her father, played by John Cleese (his facial-expressions of shock after learning of what his little angel actually does for a living are hilarious), where she tells him that being an Angel makes her feel alive -- as opposed to being a Neurosurgeon, which would otherwise make her feel like just an ordinary adult working for the dollar.<br />Considering this, you get the feeling that, for the most part of the Angels' crime-fighting life, mentally, they're still the little girls hovering over Superwoman comics that they once were: Dreaming of one day kicking the butts of baddies, and never once ruining their make-up and angelic faces; and at the end of the day, making-out with their gorgeous boyfriends.<br />However, they're eventually going to have to \\"grow-up.\\" They will age. And they will have to quit being Angels. But for now -- to quote Gene Hackman from The Royal Tenenbaums -- they're \\"living' it up,\\" and \\"loving every damn moment with this crew.\\" And so are we -- or, so am I, rather. I could give a damn what anyone else thinks.
0385334206|2.0|I'll admit I only got about 50 pages into this book, so I can't offer the most informed opinion. But from what I read, this book is little more than garbage. I read &quot;Cats Cradle&quot; and enjoyed it. I didn't agree with everything in it but it was very clever and subtle. This on the other hand, has no subtlety. It reads like the lyrics to a rage against the machine song. Just pure liberal ranting about how everything established in America is wrong. Also, his drawings seem like a cop out, an excuse not to describe something. If you want to read good satire, read Heller, or John Kennedy Toole. This book is a lemon.
0783225970|4.0|I watched Scarface a long time ago,and considered it to be one of the classics of cinema, a film of sheer raw power, unrelenting in its brutality, with no redemption to any of the characters involved in this dangerous drugs game.<BR>Then, few years have passed before I watched it again. Now, more mature and with hundreds of movies later, I did see some flaws and made few observations which I would like to share it with you.<BR>It is still a wonderfully made, or shall I say remade movie, and Al Pacino's performance, although somewhat over the top in places, is a powerhouse of 'method' acting. Many of his lines in Scarface have entered history, and his portrayal of Cuban Refugee Tony Montana, with all the successes, excesses and failures, is mind blowing. Yet the film has not aged very well.<BR>It is first and foremost a child of its time,the eighties, despite the fact that Scarface is a remade of Howard Hawks original.<BR>Another observation, revolves around the film's violence. Scripted by none other than Mr Oliver Stone who shocked audiences later with his own Natural Born Killers, there is too much graphic violence, and so much blood to make even Dario Argento squirm. True,this violence reflects the brutal and very dangerous world of drug trafficking, however,the power of suggestion and psychological violence ala Don Siegel, could have worked equally well in balanced propotions.<BR>My universal one million dollar movie question has always been why on earth censors allow so much gore and blood and F words, yet cry murder at any sign of equally graphic nudity and invent new classification for it (NC17).<BR>The last observation I would like to make, revolves around the final scene. I believe that scene, although very powerful and memorable, as many would consider it an all time classic, was hastily filmed. The failure of the an assasination attempt in the morning,because Montana got a soft spot for the family in the car of the target,he gets a threatening 'I will show you you so and so' type of call in the afternoon from the Latin drug lord Suza, and few hours later, hundreds of gun totting latinos storm the not so well protected mansion to kill Montana.My first thought was, where did all these guys come from?? Where is the security that the paranoid Montana insisted on and paid so much for? I would imagine a guy like him would have literaly an whole army!! <BR>The always excellent M-E Mastrantoni last scene is over the top, and Montana talking to his dead sister in a shocked and drugged insanity is too sentimental, given the development and pace of this last scene.<BR>All supporting actors are great, from Mastrantonio, to Steven Bauer, to the highly underrated Robert Loggia, and of course the then unknown Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her earliest roles.<BR>Now finally few words about Brian De Palma. I have truly mixed feelings about De Palma.On one hand, he can be considered as a Hitchcok wannabe with films like Body Double, Sisters, Obsession and Dressed To Kill, and on the other as an original film maker with gems like the underrated cult classic Phantom of Paradise, Mission Impossible and Carrie.<BR>With Scarface, although a remade and not original film as stated above, you can clearly see his and Stone's prints all over it.<BR>So notwithstanding my observations about Scarface, it is still a very good entertaining film, and this is what is important after all. You can suspend belief and excuse the flaws in it, but if you are still entertained by genuis performances and able direction then it certainly should be in your collection.
1400031362|4.0|Another good book, not quite as good as some of the others, but still a pleasant read.  Precious Ramotswe is busy.  She is moving her detetective office into her fiance's business to help cut costs as her detective agency is not doing as well, financially, as she would like.  Her fiance is not feeling well and she is trying to help him plus take care of a couple of orphans and solve her cases.  Her character is one of warmth, kindness, generosity and strength. One of the things that I like about these books is that I get a glimpse of what life is like in Botswana, Africa.
B00009TB5G|5.0|OK, after reading through some of these reviews, I can't but help notice all the references to the point that having Elves at Helms Deep was not accurate to the book.  To this I say, \\"So what?\\"  Why?  I'll tell you why.<br />But first I'll preface this by saying that I'm not an artsy fartsy film critic by any means, but if any of these reviewers had listened to the Director's/Writer's commentary on the Extended Edition of FELLOWSHIP, they would have learned that some things have to changed, added, or even deleted in order to make a compelling film.  And not only a compelling film, but one that moves along.  By that I mean, several events characters were changed in personality and timings in order to get the most \\"umphh\\" within the alotted run time.<br />Secondly, many if not all of the added scenes in the Extended Edition were originally cut due to flow reasons, even though some were very important to the overall LOTR trilogy storyline.  So the changes in TWO TOWERS that everyone is complaining about were probably made in order to give the same feeling or point, that probably couldn't otherwise be filmed.  The big change of Elves at Helms Deep can and wil probably be logically explained in the commentary on the TTT-EE DVD.<br />Now I also thought that TTT felt rushed in its theatrical release, so I'm really hopeful that these 43 additional minutes will add or even correct a few of the changes to the overall flow and story of TTT.  However, one should also poing out that the abrupt ending of TTT was intended mainly due to running time.  The events that supposedly fill out the end of the book will be the first events in ROTK.  Look for the EE of the ROTK DVD to feature nearly an hour of additional scenes.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Krall has never been more beautiful in her singing, timing, piano playing and intercourse with both her trio and maganificent orchestra. She can jam with power, her respect for those who inspire her is evident throughout, and, if you have seen the video of this concert, she comes across as a mature and gorgeous woman of great feeling.  For a single cut-- a devastating interpretation of &quot;A Case of You&quot; -- this would be worth it every penny.
B00004X01U|5.0|Help, I can't find the six stars button! IMHO, this is Madonna's best album ever!(excluding the Greatest Hits collections) Yes, I think it's even better than Ray of Light. ROL was great, but this CD is a perfect blend of all things techno and acoustic guitar. Here is a rundown of the tracks<br />1. Music-You've probably heard it on the radio, &quot;Music, makes the people, come together.&quot; This features a groovy techno beat that makes you wanna dance and sounds like the old Madonna. 6/5 stars<br />2. Impressive Instant- The best song on the CD, this features Madonna's voice warped and I mean warped. Not in a bad way, just in a very techno-ish way. The background music and the lyrics flow beautifully together. 6/5 stars<br />3. Runaway Lover- The beat is catchy and I love the lyrics. However, the ending is a little annoying. 5/5 stars<br />4. I Deserve It-This is dedicated to her now-husband Guy Ritchie. When she says &quot;This guy was made for me-&quot; This is also the first of the tracks that blends the acoustic guitar in with the electronica background. Very personal and beautiful. 6/5 stars<br />5. Amazing-Starts off slows, then goes into another rhythm that makes you wanna DANCE! More techno-ish than number 4, this one also blends some piano into it. 6/5 stars<br />6. Nobody's Perfect- A little long, but it is beautiful and confessional. She also speaks the truth, Nobody IS Perfect. Not as good as Amazing, but still great. 5/5 stars<br />7. Don't Tell Me- Another hit. This one has a lot of acoustic guitar once again blended with techno. Awesome lyrics, go cowgirl Madonna. Get the Maxi single too! 6/5 stars<br />8. What it Feels Like for A Girl-Sort of a hit, begins with a British person stereotyping women and is very different from the rest of the album. Being a girl myself I love it. 6/5 stars<br />9. Paradise(Not for Me)-the longest song on the CD, but it's worth every second. Very dark and haunting, with a verse song in French. Again, very electronic sounding and personal for M.<br />10. Gone- Takes awhile to grow on you, but the background music is beautiful. I didn't like it at first, but now I give it a 5/5 stars.<br />Overall grade-A+<br />So buy it if you are <BR>A- a Madonna fan<BR>B-like techno music or<BR>C-like to dance.<br />Even if you have GHV2, Madonna fans, I STILL recommend this album. Music, Don't Tell Me, and What it Feels Like for a Girl *are* virtually the same as on that disc, but you also get  Impressive Instant, I Deserve It, Amazing and Paradise(Not for Me) which were not on there(b/c they were not hits) And the rest of the CD is worth the purchase, as all the tracks are A+
B00009V7T2|5.0|Once upon a time, there was a good band called At The Drive-In. Sadly, this band broke up, and music fans were very sad. But from the ashes of At The Drive-In came two new bands, one of which is: The Mars Volta. And their debut album, &quot;De-Loused At The Comatorium&quot; will probably be remembered as one of the most interesting albums this year.<br />&quot;Son Et Lumiere&quot; is a melodic buildup to the fireball of &quot;Inertiatic ESP,&quot; the eerie string-driven &quot;Tira Me A Las Aranas,&quot; the haunting drum-laden &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot; with its lamenting howls, the rollicking &quot;Eriatarka,&quot; the slightly overlong but very compelling &quot;Cicatriz ESP,&quot; the chaotic &quot;This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed,&quot; the soft and melodic &quot;Televators,&quot; and the At the Drive-In-influenced &quot;Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt.&quot;<br />&quot;De-Loused&quot; is hard to classify, a combo of rock, psychedelica, jazz, Latin music, and a few others I probably couldn't detect at first listenings. It's a sweeping panorama of music, mountains and oceans and winds and stars. For that matter, it's not really much like several tracks as a single track that bobs into different musical areas -- often the tracks will melt into one another, barely pausing before the next song starts. It gives &quot;De-Loused&quot; the feeling of a tapestry.<br />The lyrics and music reflect this feel; the lyrics are wrenchingly weird, with an undeniably powerful melancholy/dark edge, even in lines as simple as the wail of &quot;Now I'm lost!&quot;. The music can switch from guitar-driven chaos to delicate instrumentals tinged with a synthesizer. Nothing here is what you expect it to be; it's like stepping through a door into a world where the rules of music don't apply.<br />Mars Volta is a blast of explosive new rock music, stuff that words can't describe. You have to see this stuff for yourself, or you won't believe what is said about it. Get &quot;De-Loused,&quot; come into the &quot;Comatorium.&quot; And they lived happily ever after...
B0000524CY|5.0|Let alone the best horror film ever made this film is a classic. The director didn't overdue the horror moments like most directors. Even used some to the imagination with the cop's description of the death of the director. Every moment that Regan, the little girl, does something extrodinary it is etched in our minds as we cringe. If you haven't seen this movie already please do so soon, especially in the dark. Like I had said before this film definitely is a classic.
B0000542DJ|5.0|One thing about this film is that the dialouge is just fantastic, the cast was phenominal. After watching this movie you differently realize that there was a conspiracy of the assination of JFK, I mean really the Warren Commissions facts are theatrical, you'd have to be a great fool to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone &amp; only fired 3 shots. My favorite line in the movie &quot;let justice be done, though the heavens fall.&quot; That's just a priceless dialougue. I don't have the DVD DC yet, but I will soon, and it'll truley be one of the great DVDs I have, ranking up there with the Godfather Collection &amp; T2
B00006690G|5.0|this album is incredible. eminem lyrical ability never fades and this album proves he really is a genius. this is the type of cd that is great from start to finish. every song is my favorite. there is no [bad] songs on this album. <BR>GO BUY THIS CD....NOW!!
B000002LOE|3.0|I like this cd but the song shiny happy people just irratates me so much (cant be helped), the best track on the album is losing my religion even though it was played over and over again and still is in records shops etc, it's worth picking up though.
0156027321|3.0|Everybody else here seems to have enjoyed this book much more than I did.  I thought the story was good, and his writing style is captivating, but it's a very simple story and doesn't actually take too much reader involvement.  This is the kind of book you can put down for a few weeks and pick up right where you left off without actually missing it.  There are many better shipwreck stories than this one, and the ending was just kind of blah.  I don't recommend it for anything more than a beach read.
B0000669JL|5.0|This is a very well mixed and produced Bob Marley cd and is probably the best cd to buy as unlike some the recordings are not scratchy or badly recorded i would recommened this to any fan of this genre or anyone into world music. The stand out track on this album is buffalo slodier though the rest are great aswell.
B00005JK8K|4.0|While certainly not the best war movie out there, this one is definitely high on the list.  Especially refreshing was the fact that the story takes place in the usually neglected Pacific Theatre, where most books and movies concentrate almost exclusively on the ETO.  While it is based on factual events, some things were rather unbelievable, but those can probably be attributed to artistic license.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to any fan of war movies.
1573226521|5.0|I might just be too generous giving this 5 stars as when it comes to the genre of tropical beaches i tend to love the book immediatley but this is a well written book and with it been his first has been very well thought. I liked the idea of exploring to find the beach as it's the kind of thing i would do so it made me empathise with the characters (especially Richard), the book is alot better than the film the film does'nt really do the book justice and the book is very lucid and well conducted throughout, the beach is a great modern adveture story and when you read the book is easy to see why you could be inspired enough to make a film of it, it's a hooking, captivating book thats hard to put down with no reall errors in it so if your looking for a good adventure book then this is probably the one, it's also got a good refrance to modern life like street fighter 2 on the gameboy etc..
B000002MJ0|5.0|Simply put, Loveless has a lot of overlapping guitars which create this heavenly fluid extremely melodic wash......Whereas Isn't anything? has a completely differently unique sound of its own. Doesn't flow nearly as well but it's not suppose to, it's choppier more offbeat perse but the incredible melodies are still there. It has its own vibe, that I really haven't heard anything like in any other album. Standout tracks that beg for repeated listens: &quot;No More Sorry,&quot; &quot;Sueisfine,&quot; &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; and &quot;I can See it&quot; and &quot;cupid come&quot;. No skip tracks though
B00004XQP4|5.0|I respect Greenday they go out and play what they want to play which is why i've always had a high opinion of them, all the tracks are out of 5 in this order.<br />warning - 3/5<BR>blood sex and booze - 3/5<BR>church on sunday - 4.5/5<BR>fashion victim - 5/5<BR>castaway - 5/5<BR>misery - 5/5<BR>deadbeat holiday - 5/5<BR>hold on - 5/5<BR>jackass - 3.5/5<BR>waiting - 4/5<BR>minority - 4/5<BR>macys day parade - 5-5<br />The stand out tracks are hold on, castaway and misery. I hope Greenday dont start playing what the fans want to hear ie: pop-punk and play whatever they want to play as they would be contradicting themselves if they did. Anyway great album thats definatley worth picking up.
B000066NW0|1.0|No, I'm not talking about this album or its creators, but the mindless lemmings who actually purchased it. Yet another entity on the \\"music\\" scene driven by commercial interests only. This is quite possibly the fakest and most disgusting album to come out of the whole teeny-bopper frenzy that started with Backstreet Boys/Hansen/Britney back in the late 90s, and what makes this stand out is its attempt to appear more sophisticated than Britney or Christina. The music is manufactured, the girl herself is manufactured and fake as hell in every way imaginable (voice, looks, etc.), and most of all, her \\"attitude\\" is enough to induce vomiting when you see the fans eat it up. To be sure, this isn't punk music (which reminds me, even Green Day and Offspring look like Mozart's big brother while listening to \\"Sk8er Boi\\" or \\"Complicated\\"), but the \\"artist\\" herself is undoubtedly a punk... she's just fortunate to be of the correct measurements and stature to have been statistically selected by the record company to appear on this pre-written record to feed to the masses. Maybe in a few years the fans can feel even better about themselves by moving up the latter to Michelle Branch or Matchbox 20.
0385335482|1.0|I like fluff books.<br />But this one was just taken too far. There is no real plot. Rebecca Bloomwood is a self absorbed weak excuse for a woman. She can't think of ANYTHING except shopping. Honest to goodness, she can't go more than 10 minutes without thinking of herself. As a result, she doesn't have any friends (unless you can count her flatmate Suzy - someone she couldn't care less about) but this doesn't bother her in the least.  Who needs friends when there are stores?<br />The novel didn't even reach a turning point until around page 220, which is more than two-thirds of the way through the book. The previous pages were merely spend going on and on about how much Rebecca loved shopping.<br />Dear Lord - there are people who actually like THIS fluff? At least fluffy romance novels have ROMANCE in them and GOOD THINGS happening in them. For this novel, we have to spend its entirety feeling horrible for poor Becky Bloomwood, save for the last 50 pages where things just FALL IN HER LAP.<br />This novel disgusted me. I'm going to have to choose deeper fluff from now on if I want to give my mind something fun to read.  The best thing about this book (the paperback) was it's beautifully done front cover.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I love this cd, i listin to it over and over and over...i dont even know spanish and i still dont mind the spanish songs...
B00003CXFG|5.0|Pitch Black is the perfect example of that rare circumstance where a movie becomes a work of art.<br />From the very beginning of the movie, it draws you in and holds on to your attention.  The opening seconds really make you feel the loneliness and hostility of deep space, then proceed to make you feel that you are a part of this universe, in humanity's dark and dreary future.<br />The characters involved present a cynical, but fairly accurate, representation of the human race.  By far the coolest of these is the escaped convict Richard B. Riddick.  This is Vin Diesel at his best.<br />During the first part of the movie, you're treated to some of the most beautiful lighting effects you will ever see in the movies, which adds flavor to the development of the story.<br />Now, the ecology of the planet in this movie is often criticized because such an ecosystem couldn't survive.  However, in case you haven't figured it out, it's supposed to be that way.  We don't know a whole lot about this planet's history, but one thing we do know is that its ecosystem has been decimated by these creatures and, because of that, they themselves are also about to go extinct, making the planet into a dead rock in space.<br />As the movie progresses, you can see an eerie similarity between the creatures and the present representatives of humanity...
B000002GQL|5.0|By 1972, The Moody Blues had definitely come a long way from 1965's hit \\"Go Now\\", which was an R&B cover like most British rock bands were specializing in at the time. They were now majestic orchestral rockers with 6 albums in the style under their belt, all of them selling fabulously with the Moodies touring their butts off in support of them. That year (1972), \\"Nights In White Satin\\" from their landmark DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED (1967) became a belated #2 hit in the U.S., as did the album. So expectations had to be high for their next album SEVENTH SOJOURN, and the Moodies more than met them with their first #1 album, one that had the band creating some of the most personal & reflective music of their career.<br />It was clear that the Moodies were a little tuckered out from the hectic last 5 years of constant activity, so the material on SEVENTH SOJOURN has a tinge of weariness & exhaustion to it. But that doesn't make it half-heartedly done, hardly. Exchanging their trademark Mellotron for the more updated Chamberlain, the band still managed to create an ethereal beauty of sound that's at once rousing and calming.<br />While Justin Hayward has often been acknowledged as the Moodies' \\"leader\\", there really hasn't been one, for all 5 members of the group had a hand in the songwriting, but most often it was Justin's material that got released. For SOJOURN, bassist John Lodge received the ultimate reward by having both of the songs he wrote for the album put out as singles. The beautiful \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" (that echo is just haunting!) was released well in advance of the album, and did reasonably well, peaking at #29. This 6-minute epic accurately describes the Moodies' disillusionment at the time, for even though they were one of the biggest bands in the world at the time, they felt as if they were losing touch with reality. If that wasn't enough, the totally rocking (and my personal favorite) \\"I'm Just A Singer [In A Rock & Roll Band]\\" lays further claim to the Moodies only being human. The song reached #13, becoming an eternal concert staple. If anything, the Moodies were still trying to stay grounded amidst all the temptation of the rock & roll lifestyle.<br />Justin Hayward is still on top of things with his 3 compositions, proving himself as the real embodiment of the Moodies' orchestral sound. The tranquil \\"New Horizons\\", the rocking \\"You & Me\\" (co-written with drummer Graeme Edge), and the jaunty \\"The Land Of Make Believe\\" show a slight relief from the more personal material the other members were creating for the album. I guess Justin was creating business as usual for SEVENTH SOJOURN, whereas the other Moodies thought of it as more of a personal trial (just read the liner notes).<br />Keyboardist Mike Pinder was probably the most affected by the Moodies' fast-touring & recording schedule, for his songs are definitely those of a man having enough of it all (he would record only one more album with the group). \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" & \\"When You're A Free Man\\" say it all, and perhaps it was a relief for him that the Moodies would take a break shortly after this album. However, the songs still show Pinder creatively triumphing even in the midst of personal turmoil. Flautist Ray Thomas only contributes one song to the album (he has been somewhat given little opportunity to write throughout the Moodies' history), but it's the sweet \\"For My Lady\\" (written for his wife, I think) that graces the album's presence. With the band members all now married & with families, it was clear Thomas was finding great peace on the homefront away from the road & the studio.<br />SEVENTH SOJOURN helped make the Moody Blues confirmed superstars in the rock world, and most bands would be hard-pressed to follow it up immediately to keep their new & old fans occupied. So the fact that they temporarily separated for 6 years to regain their energy could have been commercial suicide in the long run. Yet they would return with OCTAVE in 1978, and pickup where they left off. While Mike Pinder would eventually be no longer ready to resume the touring-recording treadmill again, at least he ended his time with the Moodies on a high. In the meantime, SEVENTH SOJOURN was a great way to end the first chapter in the Moodies' long history.up where they left off. While Mike Pinder would eventually be no longer ready to resume the touring-recording treadmill again, at least he ended his time with the Moodies on a high. In the meantime, SEVENTH SOJOURN was a great way to end the first chapter in the Moodies' long history.
B0000028RR|5.0|What happens when you fuse metal, punk, hip-hop and jazz elements with three very talented musicians and a guitar genius?<BR>RAGE...<BR>THe first album was angry and raw, a sense of enrgy never achieved by any ohter group.Evil Empire showed the evolution into more hip-hop. Battle of Los Angeles was an engaging album showing a more refined sound.<BR>The last album is lacking in creativity because every song is an adaptation but the musical talent is still raging.<BR>My dieing wish is that they will reunite and create another masterpiece.
B00005JKED|4.0|***Movie fact: \\"John Q\\" was filmed before \\"Training Day\\", but \\"Training Day\\" was released first because the producers felt that it's unusual for Denzel Washington to play a heartless villian.  They figured that if the audience didn't like him in that role, then \\"John Q\\" was to be the apology.<br />Denzel Washington needs no apologies for one of his best career performances in this wonderful action movie.  This is one of the more unique and the best police movies made in 2001.  It brilliantly desplicts the use and the dealing of narcotics.  This describes perfectly how to be a good and a bad cop.  <br />Washington deserved his second Oscar win for his portrayal of a criminal police officer, an unusual role for him.  This proves that the brilliant actor has many more monumental roles in the future.  Ethan Hawke deserved his first Oscar nomination as a cop in training trying to do the right thing.  Hopefully, Hawke is seen more often in the future in roles like this.  Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray prove in \\"Training Day\\" that they are talented outside of music.<br />The writers, the director, and the producers chose the perfect dark theme for this movie genre.  They make Washington's character's lifestyle as dark as it should be.  They desplict the drug houses and narcotic use as dirty as many of them are in real life.  They give Hawke's character the light that it deserves for being the good guy.  This combination blends with all events perfectly.<br />Those who are not used to such a unique movie may have to watch it twice to truly appreciate the quality.  The first watch may seem unproportioned.  The second watch will further understand all the scenes, therefore proportioning everything.
B00004RD54|5.0|This was a great album even without the bonus tracks. Great songs, band, and arrangements. A real Classic and must for a Lou Reed fan.
B000002INJ|2.0|I used to like this album but then I got sick of it because of this band's tastelessly cheesy antics. &quot;Warrirs prayer&quot; made me cringe every time I heard it. Next to everything released by Bal Sagoth, that is one of the cheesiest tracks I've heard on a metal album. The lyrics are typical Manowar arrogance in which Eric Adams boasts about how they're  &quot;real metal&quot; and other bands are not. It's tiring. Manowar starting doing that since the New wave of British Heavy metal days and their still doing it! Well, I'm done. Personally, I would recommend anything by Kamelot if someone wants to listen to some cheesy power metal with some good taste and intelligence.
B00000637V|5.0|Yes, its very dark. But its his best solo album. Outside of Live albums I can't think of any of Lou's Solo albums that even compare to Berlin. It's a dark masterpiece.
B000002IU9|1.0|This is getting old really fast. Same old formulaic power chord structure and meaningless lyrics. Here we have completely stale and unoriginal song titles such as \\"Metal warriors\\" and \\"Power of thy sword\\". Power of thy sword? Are these guys serious? For a taste of lyrical arrogance, check out two particular phrases in \\"Metal warriors\\". They first phrase goes something like this: \\"Heavy metal or no metal at all. Wimps and posers leave the hall\\". Who are these guys to say what real and false metal is? The second phrase is as follows: \\"If you're not into metal, you are not my friend\\". That means nothing to me since I enjoy listening to Metal, but what what about those who don't? Are these guys saying that they have a burning hatred and intolerance for those who don't listen to Metal? That's not what Metal is supposed to be about. These guys either need to make their music more accepting and versatile or just go away. Quite frankly, people are getting tired of their neverending rant.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Simply amazing, Xtian gracefully grows in this elite piece of work showing that she is not the once crowned pop princess that she used to be but rather a multi-talented artist that has the ability to sing, write and even produce her own songs.

B000001EYW|5.0|This CD has stirred a lot of feelings and emotions that I have hidden for many years.  Now that I'm 43 and a Bee Gees fan since I was 11 in 1971, I feel I can freely express how I'm really feeling about people, spouse and situations with &quot;friends&quot;.  Every single song on this CD expresses one or more feelings that I have towards marriage, friends, personal feelings and being misunderstood by so many, with the exception of some REAL friends who are also creative people, artists, lovers and &quot;Those That Choose to See differ from from Those Who LOOK&quot;.  Get it?  If you don't like this CD, you are none of the above.
B0000667RO|2.0|This cd is not the true Bryan Adams greatest hits album. The true Bryan Adams greatest hits album remains &quot;So Far So Good&quot;. This cd is missing several of his biggest hits, including &quot;Heaven&quot;. The cd lags at times and just doesn't have the same fire as &quot;So Far So Good&quot;. Pass on this cd, it just isn't worth it if you're a casual fan.  This is only for hardcore Bryan Adams fans.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|First, please read Larry McMurtry's excellent original novel. It is a rich tapestry of characterization, language and vivid descriptions of place. Simultaneously brutal and lyrical LONESOME DOVE is one of the finest American works of literature ever produced. That said the film version stands as one of the greatest novel to film adaptations ever made.<br />Capturing much of the rich novel's immense depth and vision, this epic film is perhaps one of the finest dramatic pieces ever created for television. Clocking in at over six hours, this film never drags and possesses, with the exception of THE WILD BUNCH, simply the finest ensemble acting ever seen in the Western Genre. <br />Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones give textbook examples of effective film acting. The literal volumes they communicate about the human soul with only a blink of an eye or the wave of a hand stand as a lasting testament to the art of acting. Granted while McMurtry's brilliant omniscient point of view is lost for the camera, Duvall and Jones and the rest of the cast completely capture each characters'dynamic inner life.<br />The film also contains standout performances from Angelica Huston, Danny Glover, Tim Scott, Diane Lane, Rick Schroeder, Chris Cooper, Steve Buscemi and many others. <br />In a perfect world this would have been produced for the big theatrical screen in 70mm widescreen. The framing and cinematography do appear sadly cramped for such a sprawling work. Such is the case with a film made for television.<br />On that note, the DVD possesses a rather poor transfer that renders the film rather shallow visually.<br />Still this is but a small matter as LONESOME DOVE is as close to the American Odyssey as THE GRAPES OF WRATH and other great literary works. The timeless theme that life is full of changes is brought home in a most profound, beautiful and ultimately entertaining package. Simply put, this is not a film to be missed, it is to be sought out and treasured like the dearestfamily heirloom.

B00009V7RF|4.0|I give this CD 4 stars.  I agree with the reviewer that feels that Black Eyed Peas puts hip-hop more in line with where it should be, and that is about feelin' good, and tryin' to treat humanity with love and respect.  There are times when I still think that they do get a bit too verbally graphic when it comes to describing their love of women in terms of their physical attributes versus the treasure of their minds (as in the track about \\"Latin girls\\").  All in all, I was thoroughly impressed with the end product, and found myself groovin' to the beat throughout the entire CD!  I especially love the track where BEP pulls a sample from off the jazz shelf (is it bossa nova?!  sounds like a Stan Getz composition to me!).  This, if for no other reason, should put BEP on the commendation list as they are truly opening the doors of our great jazz legacy to young hip-hoppers who may not understand nor appreciate this musical genre.  As far as I'm concerned, BEP's Elephunk is \\"the bomb.\\"  The group deserves props as being creative hip hop/jazz poet artists who aren't afraid to expand their musical horizons by reaching out and encompassing the historical perspective of the roots of American music which rests in the African aesthetic.
0385508417|5.0|Skipping Christmas is a different type of book by John Grisham. It's not about law and there is not one court scene. It's about a small family of three, two parents and a young daughter. The book starts out with the departure of Blair, the daughter of Nora and Luther (the two parents). Blair is going off into the jungles of South America for a goodwill mission.<br />Luther and Nora, the two parents, are dismayed that their beloved daughter is gone into the mysterious jungles. Luther, the father, realizes that this Christmas season will be different. Much different. He gets an idea when he realizes how much stress, money, and pain go into Christmas. Why not skip the whole ordeal. No office party, no gratuitous and unsolicited Christmas cards, and no wasted money on gifts. His plan is to skip Christmas all together, and he tells his plan to his wife.<br />If you haven't ever read a John Grisham book before, this would be a great start. It's a short read, with only 177 pages. The story is wonderful, and the ending is superb. This was also the funniest John Grisham book I've ever read, and I truly enjoyed it. It's similar to &quot;A Painted House&quot; in that it's not about law or the legal genre. That's a refreshing change of style for Grisham, who incorporates a humorous dose of wit and sarcasm in &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot; This is a great story by John Grisham, and if you haven't read it I suggest you do. The beginning might seem a little slow, but don't worry-the book starts getting really interesting (after Chapter 5). &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; was a great Christmas novel that changed the way I thought about the unique American and Christian tradition.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I award this album 4 stars for high excellence in the field of music. It's just plain fun. Andrew WK is a cool, fun-loving guy who makes kickass party rock music. Just listen to this album and you'll feel like you're a teenager again. And if you still are a teenager, you'll love it too! Check out &quot;Ready To Die&quot; and &quot;Party Hard&quot;; they are excellent songs.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I watched this on DVD (widescreen edition) and while it was entertaining enough while it was on-screen, there's not much depth or substance here.  Tobey Maguire is passable as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst is appealing as Mary Jane (although I found her obviously dyed red hair distracting).  The first half of the movie works well, but at the end it just becomes ridiculous; super strength is one thing, but supporting a cable car full of people would pull Spidey's arms right out of their sockets!  It would have been a better movie if they'd toned it down a bit, especially the fight sequences.

B00009V2ND|2.0|I consider myself an afficianado of the U.S. space program of the 1960s and early '70s, so I eagerly anticipated the arrival of Kranz's book.<br />Kranz has always seemed to be a man of the utmost integrity, dedication and competence. But a page-turning writer he is not. If he used a ghost writer on this book he was ripped off, seeing as how the prose is dry as dust.<br />The book is likely a valuable contribution to history, but it will probably be more referenced in future books than it will be read in its entirety.
0783240236|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock said that &#34;there is a terrifying meaning lurking right underneath the surface of The Birds.&#34;  This meaning has heretofore been kept a strict secret among British and American intellectuals.  After a long and feverish struggle with my conscience over the matter, I've decided that for the benefit of mankind the sequestering of this knowledge must cease -- and what better time than on the film's 40th anniversary!<br /><br />The knotty root of this secret is contained in the title itself.  A cursory glance at a dictionary of British slang will give you the translation bird=girl.  The explication of the various connections that the film makes between the weaker sex and the avian order is left to the reader.<br /><br />There's not much more to it than that.  The film is frequently misclassified by the uninitiated: it's not a horror movie, not a man-vs-nature tale, not a piece of science fiction (the latter category  was explicitly disavowed by it's creators).  It is simply Hitchcock's allegory about the destructiveness and ugliness of the female psyche in its various manifestations -- mother, lover, rival, child, friend.<br /><br />But to say that Hitch was a misogynist would only be half right.  Like his Plato, Dr. Sigmund F., he took a dim -- dark, really -- view of the whole race.  In fact, Hitchcock slaved himself so thoroughly to Freudianism that he made a separate assessment of the value of his own work problematic.  How deep can an allegory go?  Culture critic Camile Paglia thinks &#34;The Birds&#34; is more profound than I do.  It's really only as deep as Siggy himself, but art can and should be deeper than psychology -- or any science.  Four stars, not five.
0393057658|4.0|As a long suffering Anaheim Angels fan (until 2002!), I've always found the on-field success of the Oakland A's interesting, primarily because it usually came at the expense of the Angels.  This book explains where that success comes from: GM Billy Bean and his view of baseball fundamentals.  That part of the book is interesting, if not new.  Michael Lewis certainly revels in the \\"art of the deal\\" sections of the book, similar to his approach in \\"Liar's Poker\\".<br />However, what's missing from this book is perspective and balance.  Everything other team in baseball is portrayed as free-spending dolts blinded by their illusions, which I found simplistic, unfair and unrealistic.  In baseball (which is a $3.5 billion-a-year business), on-field success doesn't always translate into off-field success.  Lewis fails to acknowledge that there may be legitimate business reasons behind many teams' free-spending approach to talent, beyond the straight-foward reason of winning baseball games.  Star players help land lucrative television deals, draws fans to the stadiums and generate merchandise sales.  If the teams happen to win some pennants along the way, all the better!<br />I just expected a book called \\"Moneyball\\" would attempt to explore this aspect of the business of baseball.

B0000060NF|5.0|Hard to believe this was recorded thirty years ago.  It sounds just as good and just as fresh today.  This album was radical back in the day for its independence from the marketing machine of Motown and the music that had become trapped in its own success.  The ones who sang about real life issues free from sugar coated lyrics were generally found amongst the genres of the blues and/or jazz, not pop music.  They were for the 'alternative' crowd.  Marvin, who had become a pop legend, was brave enough to follow his passion and he wrote and sang about what was really going on.  <br />Not only does he tackle real political issues (just as true and so much the same today as back then) he gives what is perhaps the ultimate drug trip encased within a record album.  The album sounds and feels like one long drug induced trip and it grooves along fluidly.  <br />For those who may question this judgment, consider this: 'flying high in the friendly skies, without ever leaving ground' certainly isn't talking about taking a vacation.  He admits he's hooked, he admits to being stupid-minded and that he goes crazy when he can't find it.  It's the madness that comes with addiction.  That's about as real as you get.  It's arguable that he is playing a character who is hooked, however, it could be argued as well that it is autobiographical.  Perhaps it's a bit of both.<br />And yet, as the album progresses and 'he' eases into the buzz, the music, having taken something of a mellow, almost timeless and motionless pause, begins to groove and hope sets in.  Yes, it's kicked in and he's feeling good.  It isn't much longer until he sings about love and God and Jesus and hope.  But he isn't preaching as much as he is singing from his very soul.  And this from a pop album.  As the buzz wears off he launches into one of the baddest tracks ever laid down -- Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler).<br />The album ends almost exactly where it began and the loop continues.  It was brilliant then, it is brilliant now. <br />Marvin's personal demons were no secret.  True artists have the gift for laying it out through their art.  This album is autobiographical, musically brilliant, politically subversive yet never untrue.  Pure genius through and through.  He paved the way for others to break free and sing about truth rather than making records to appease an audience hungry for 'soul' music.  If you haven't listened to it, you're missing out.  If you have and it's been a while, pay it a visit.  You'll be glad you did.
1563898586|5.0|Alan Moore, the writer of the deconstructionist super-hero work, Watchmen, once again delivers an enormous work. With a cunning grasp of the language of victorian literature and a keen insight on character of his subjects Alan Moore succeds in creating what he believes is a non-boring super hero team. Exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of the involved characters Moore draws his audience in like a spider with flies. It is up to a group of infamous people led by the charming Wilhelmina Harker, late of Dracula fame, to save England and the world from one of the most sinister villains of all time. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, a helpless opium addict and crackshot, Stevenson's dualistic anti-hero Dr. Jeckyll\Mr. Hyde, H. G. Wells Hawley Griffin, the invisible man, and Vernes terrible Cpt. Nemo must all learn to cooperate and get the job done. An excellent story exceeded only by its genius grasp of the language and the characters.
B00005YTFG|1.0|If I could rate a movie minus 10, this would be the film. The French have had three simple words for awful; viz., affreux, terrible, and atroce.  Now there is another one: the film, Moulin Rouge. This was a bad movie. It was best example I've seen of somebody trying to film a nightmare.
0345350499|1.0|I read \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" a number of years ago and was, to say the least, underwhelmed. But I certainly understand why it became a best-seller: it was a thinly-veiled radical feminist, neo-pagan, anti-Christian screed. And I'm saying this as an agnostic, almost atheistic, Jewish woman who is certainly not anti-feminist. I'm very glad to see that a number of other readers -- though too small a fraction of the 700+ reviewers here -- share my opinion.<br />Others have mentioned the factual arguments against \\"Mists\\": that by the time Arthur supposedly lived, Britain was already mostly Christian; that the \\"matriarchy\\" allegedly embraced by everyone in Europe before those eeeeevil Xtians came along has been greatly exaggerated by feminist scholars; and that paganism had its own shortcomings, notably human sacrifice. Everyone knows that the Church burned millions of \\"witches\\" in the Middle Ages; fewer know that the pagan Celts often locked their human sacrifices in giant wicker cages and burned them to death therein.<br />I don't recall all that much about the female protagonists Morgaine, Morgause, Igraine, and Viviane, except that there was a fair amount of whining and other uncommendable behavior. I do recall, however, Bradley's malicious trashing of her male characters and also Guinevere (\\"Gwenhwyfar,\\" which is the original Welsh spelling). Arthur, as someone else mentioned, is [so weak] that you wonder how such a character might have ruled a lemonade stand, let alone a  feud-rent nation of disparate clans and tribes. Lancelot has about as much depth as a male Calvin Klein underwear model. Gwenhwyfar's father is the typical insensitive, domineering patriarch. And so on and so forth.<br />The only man I seem to remember NOT getting savaged was Merlin -- and I'm hardly commending MZB's treatment of him, as he was reduced to nothing more than the doddering living representative of the Horned God with whom the priestesses mated during the fertility festivals. From Bradley's book, you'd never know of the awe-inspiring figure Merlin has traditionally cut as sorceror, sage, and protector of the infant Arthur.<br />But the worst-treated character by far in \\"Mists\\" is Gwenhwyfar, who is little but stereotype: that of the naïve, narrow-minded, puritanical, high-strung, and ultimately deceitful Christian woman. Nobility and royalty are of course no guarantee of anyone's character, but highborn women of Britain and Europe (at least until Victorian times) were generally raised to command large corps of servants, oversee their many and varied duties, take charge when the men were away at war, and certainly pitch in with the work themselves. You'd think that a woman who in legend was queen for some 20 years, and whose country was in her day at the outer reaches of civilization, would have more resourcefulness, practicality, spine, and shrewdness, even if she wasn't an admirable character.<br />Other readers have taken Bradley to task for the incest scenes, not realizing that Arthur's coupling with his half-sister (Morgause and Morgaine are sometimes merged into one character, as in Mary Stewart's books) that produces Mordred is central to the legend. Totally foreign to it, however, is the ménage-à-trois between Arthur, Gwenhwyfar, and Lancelot, justified in their minds by Arthur's inability to impregnate his wife. Though that scene mercifully stops short before Bradley could get into any graphic detail, to me it symbolizes everything that's wrong with this novel: the legend's best-known characters, already repeatedly depicted as lily-livered, are now painted as amoral hypocrites, just so Bradley can make the other female characters into heroines for the age of political correctness.<br />And, like just about any book that runs for 800-odd pages and six decades, \\"Mists\\" is too damn long and rambling -- it's the \\"Shogun\\" or \\"War and Peace\\" of Arthurian fantasy. I wonder if Bradley's editor(s) simply trusted her work based on her reputationand didn't bother to examine it too closely, perhaps fearing that such a superstar of fantasy wouldn't have brooked the severe editing job the book badly needed, and just might have taken it to another publishing house out of pique.<br />Given all the five-star reviews, I doubt my opinion will sway any of its fans among the teeny pagan set, or among adult women who loved it *because* of its polemics. So let me reiterate what others have suggested: that they read other retellings of the story such as Gillian Bradshaw's \\"In Winter's Shadow\\" (told from Gwenhwyfar's viewpoint); Mary Stewart's Arthurian tetralogy; Diana L. Paxson's own series on the subject, as well as her novel \\"The White Raven\\" (a reworking of the Tristan and Iseult romance narrated by Iseult's handmaiden); and, finally, a book by a (gasp!) male author, Parke Godwin, called \\"Firelord,\\" which is from Arthur's perspective but is highly sympathetic to \\"Morgana,\\" as he calls her.
B000099T2L|5.0|I have been a fan of Destiny's Child ever since they came out with their first album. So I decided to pick up Beyonce's album \\"Dangerously In Love\\" and here's what I thought of her debut album.<br />01. \\"Crazy In Love\\" (featuring Jay-Z) - A definate hit the instrument arrangement on this track is tight and it make a tight song. And Jay-Z's verse is tight.<br />02. \\"Naughty Girl\\" - This song reminds me of an old school track. The beat is hot and her vocals are hot. She's basically sayin' tonight she'll be a \\"Naughty Girl\\".<br />03. \\"Baby Boy\\" (featuring Sean Paul) - 1 of my favorite tracks on the album. It has a regaee feel towards the beat of this song. And Sean Paul verses are tight!.<br />04. \\"Hip Hop Star\\" (featuring Big Boi & Sleepy Brown) - This track isn't my favorite on the album. But it would appeal to people who like rock music. But this is an okay track.<br />05. \\"Be With You\\" - A slow jam love track. I like the beat of this song. It reminds you of another old school song. I like this one also.<br />06. \\"Me, Myself And I\\" - I can relate to this track, becase in the lyrics it says \\"Me myself and I is all I got in the end.\\" and that is true.<br />07. \\"Yes\\" - She's expaling all that she's agreed to in an relationship. It's an alright track.<br />08. \\"Signs\\" (featuring Missy Elliott) - She's explaing the differnt signs that appeals to her. The piano played on this track makes this a hot track. And Missy did a good job on producing this one.<br />09. \\"Speechless\\" - The guitar on this track is hot. This is basically a slow love song. For da bedroom.<br />10. \\"That's How You Like It\\" (featuring Jay-Z) - Another hit banga. I like this track. And Jay's verse is tight. <br />11. \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" (Duet with Luther Vandross) - I love this track. It was remake from the orignal classic. But this one is even better. Luter's vocals was great.<br />12. \\"Dangrously In Love 2\\" - Simular to the song from Destiny's Child Survivor album. Only difference I could find isthere a piano being played in this version.<br />13. \\"Beyonce' Interlude\\" - I believe that harmonies are colors<BR>Every time I paint it sharpens my harmony<BR>Yesterday I tried to paint you<BR>But the colors werent beautiful enough<BR>Your love goes beyond what I can say<BR>Love Beyonce<br />14. \\"Gift From Virgo\\" - A slow jam song.<br />15. \\"Daddy\\" *Bonus - I love this song. She remembers all the memories she had with her Daddy, and she want her unborn son and husband to be just like her daddy.
B00006879E|5.0|Great cd. It's punk jazz. I personally never thought that was possible. I guess it is, and this band pulls it off spectacularly! If you want more by them here's a hint: they used to go by the name Kara's Flowers. This is a band proclaimed talented by the likes of John Mayer and Jason Mraz. It doesn't have that characteristic richness of regular punk, the guitar is very...well, it's... it's great yes.. what's the word I'm looking for... It's specific, they're songs have some very specific guitarwork. I suppose. Don't listen to me I play piano not guitar. Anyway, great cd, although the guy's voice gets on my nerves after a while. That's just me though, I still like the cd a lot.
B00005JMC6|5.0|I find my self coming out of a movie theater every once in a while speechless and only once in the last ten or so years crying and this movie is the one that did both.  <BR>   If you are to see one film in a theater this year, make this one it.  Maybe every one will stand up and applaud too, like in the theater I saw it at.
0743244249|3.0|Dellilo's New York limo ride flows well enough through the first half of the book. The premise allows itself to open an array of bizzare situations: a billionaire twenty-something want to ride in his suped-up stretch limo to get a haircut. On the way he has encounters with lovers, ex-lovers, and advisors in matters of technology, finance, security, and theory. Dellilo's prose is highly restrained with limited, but rich descriptions of neighborhoods that unfold through the eyes of billionaire Eric. There are some truly original hilarious subversive instances where Eric displays his detatchment from society such as when he makes sexual advances to a female executive while getting a prostate exam in his back seat (No pun intended). <br />As allegory, it holds up; the plot itself fails to hold up at times though because of the limited style he chooses with certain situations. The female characters blend into non-memorable hybrids of slut-artist-vixen-heiress-mystic. In a style very reminiscent of Chuck Palahnuik ('Fight Club') Eric's journey unfolds as his own deathmarch which Eric is all too willing to accept. The social critique is clear enough: the market culture is tainting our humanity and the democracy as corporate-kleptocracy will test what is left of it. Delillo delivers in 'Cosmopolis'. I only wish that his characterization was as substantial as every thing else in his novel.
B000008L90|4.0|Does anyone know if this album is out of print?  I would like to have this album on CD if possible.  This album goes great with other Donna albums.  There Goes My Baby and Supernatural Love were hits while Forgive Me won her a Grammy for Best Inspirational Performance.  For this reason alone, I give it 4 stars.<br />Obviously, most people will not rank this album very high because of her huge '70s albums and because this is gospel-flavored.  Music critics like to shun anything gospel.  That's really a shame!  This album deserves a second-chance listen!
B00003CXRM|2.0|When I saw \\"Fargo\\" a few years back, I was thoroughly unimpressed. But so many people claimed its virtues, I began wondering if I'd just been in a bad frame of mind at the time.  Having now seen  \\"Oh Brother,\\" by the same filmmakers, I know my impression of \\"Fargo\\" was no mistake.  \\"Oh Brother\\" suffers from many of the same problems.  <br />Both films overwhelmingly rely on trite and shallow stereotypes of people (Fargo-Upper Midwesterners;  Brother-Southerners) for their humor-such as it is.  ....  It's one thing to laugh at human foibles, it's another to make disparaging characterizations the central focus of the film-especially when there's little else to commend.  <br />\\"Oh Brother\\" skips along, illogically, with subplots that appear and disappear without any development and, often, without connection.  For example, three escaped cons and a guitar player they meet on the road, hornswoggle their way on to a radio broadcast singing a highly polished rendition of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\"-although their connection to music up to that point in the film is non-existent.  <br />Later, they happen upon three sultry young women (Sirens) in the woods.  The possibilities look good for our three cons when (poof!) two are now on the ground, waking-the third gone.  No clue as to what happened in between.  Kirk Douglas made us live, vividly, through every moment of his encounter with Sirens.  \\"Oh Brother\\" by contrast, doesn't bother with such details.  It's enough to say, \\"We met `em--let's move on to the next scene.\\"  And don't forget the corn pone.<br />Elsewhere, filmgoers are treated to a train, a mass baptism, a Ku Klux Klan rally, a bank robbery, a swindling Bible salesman, corrupt politicians, hound dogs and a sheriff with mirrored-glasses.  Get the connection?  Hee haw!<br />\\"Oh Brother\\" has been widely associated with a resurgence or discovery of bluegrass music, the soundtrack selling millions.  I, therefore, expected music to be at the forefront of the film.  It isn't really (contrast with \\"The Blues Brothers\\"--where good music is at the fore and the plot is discernible). <br />There are couple of nice bluegrass moments, however.  In one, a group of people are singing as they walk toward a baptismal pool.  In the other, The Whites are on a stage, looking as if they might be the Carter family (the film is set in the 30s)--singing \\"Sunny Side of the Mountain.\\"  But these moments, unfortunately, are short and they don't make up for the rest of the film. <br />I'm puzzled at the connection of this film with bluegrass for one of the things that makes this type of music attractive is its authenticity.  Bluegrass and old-time country is heartfelt, simple music, shorn of pretense and connected with the lives of real people.  But there's nothing at all authentic about \\"Oh Brother,\\" the film.  In fact, it's almost as if the film is mocking the music.  I was sorely disappointed to hear Ralph Stanley's voice (in its only appearance) coming out from behind a Ku Klux Klan hood.    <br />Based on the film, the music on the soundtrack is probably pretty good.  But don't expect the film to be a representation of the spirit of that music.
B00005M989|3.0|Because Prince has had so many hits during his 25 years as an artist, obviously it's difficult to make 1 CD of his best work.  Plus, this collection is quite similar to the Hits 1 and Hits 2 that you don't need this CD unless you like Money Don't Matter 2 Night.  Again songs that are missing: Batdance, Partyman and The Arms of Orion.<br />I do believe there will be more future hits albums that it will confuse everyone.  Let's see if there will be a 20th Century Millenium edition.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has tapped into what is a relatively unexplored realm in American music.  The idea of a straight-forward rock band with a female vocalist has been unheard of as of late.  This group, from Arkansas of all places, makes a notable contribution to the void that is modern popular music.  Perhaps unknowingly, Evanescence follows the style of bands like The Gathering and Lacuna Coil from Europe (which every Evanescence fan should check out).  They take an intelligent approach to arrangement and production, and Amy Lee's voice (on the CD at least) is incredible!!  I have had a very difficult time finding any new bands that hold my attention lately, but &quot;Fallen&quot; has been in my truck's CD player almost non-stop for the last several months.  If nothing else, anyone who is a true fan of MUSIC should check this album out, because it represents something different among the mass of cookie-cutter bands that currently dominate the FM radio band.
B0000640VO|5.0|I was so pleased with this movie! It tugged at my heartstrings the way fables and fairy-tales do. Indeed, the glorious cinematography kept an illustrative hue to the entire film.<br />First things first, Audrey Tautou delivers a charming performance... she is much too-often compared with Audrey Hepburn, another small-faced gamine, but her aura is decidedly different. Where Hepburn was cool and chic, Tautou is childlike and imaginative. The film focuses a good deal on the colorful workings of her imagination and the fantasies it weaves.<br />The tone of the film perfectly followed with Tautou's exuberant performance: the colors are sparkling and vivid, the scenery is slightly dream-like, the shots are appropriately quirky and surprising. This is not the real Paris, this is a memory of Paris. <br />The narration and set-up of the films delightful cast of characters is very similar to The Royal Tennenbaums. I'm sorry to invoke a comparision here, but it is so striking that I have to say it. The narration is the kind you would find in a children's tale, and the characters are introduced by their likes and dislikes. Amelie approaches life with a wide-open fresh view that sees everything for the first time and the smallest of things are of the biggest importance.<br />Amelie spends the whole film trying to bring happiness into others lives in imaginative ways. Ultimately, she must do the same for herself. The film's message is an uplifting one of innocence and optimism. Fairy-tale like, destiny always seems to take a large hand, and The Glass Man is the fairy godmother (father?) of the film, finally bestowing upon Amelie the courage to seek out happiness for herself.<br />Viewers will find this lovely fable easy to relate to, as Amelie is such a fresh and unique character. We all have a bit of her spirit in us as well as her shyness to face happiness head-on. <br />There are lots of great minor performances in this which add greatly to the local color. Amelie's knuckle-cracking coworker and her paranoid boyfriend who stalks her at work and makes notes of her every move into a portable tape recorder... The sad concierge at Amelie's apartment who loves and hates her dead cheating husband... Amelie's cold, serious father who longs to travel but never will... All these characters are magically helped by Amelie who seeks to breathe new life into their simple lives.<br />This film will do the same for you. It is a joyful little modern fairy-story of chasing down true love when you find it.
B000005IU2|5.0|The Stooges were the godfathers of punk. Their debut was awesome, but only had a small amount of experimentation compared to their 1970 album Fun House. It took a few listens for Fun House to unravel its potency, since I always thought their debut was superior, but Fun House is a crazy, sexual, and downright brilliant mess by a band who barely knew how to play their instruments, and a singer (the legendary and psychotic Iggy Pop) who was so volatile nd high strung during his performances both live and in the studio, that you never knew which guttural sound he made would be his last. <br />The band grew musically since their debut just the year before. Guitarist Ron Asheton does more with the guitar than just mess around with the wah-pedal, something he did incessantly on their previous album, Scott Asheton's drumming is more precise, and Dave Alexader's bass work, like always, was pretty consistent... well, consistent for the Stooges. They brught in a saxophone player, and the final 3 songs are an avant-garde mess, reminiscent of John Coltrane's later works, and of the Velvet Underground's first two records (both have been cited as major influences for the band). The band explores softer territory on this album with the 7 minute \\"Dirt,\\" probably the best song on the album.<br />For an awesome, stripped down, psychotic experimental to a degree rock and roll record, Fun House is satisfying, and it is an essential album both in the field of punk and rock.
B00009L1TA|4.0|Taken as a whole, this movie is a pretty good one, with plenty of plot twists and turns that aren't too transparent or predictable; for the better part it will keep you guessing as to who the real killer or killers are.  While I must admit that I've never really been a big John Travolta fan, I would have to say that his performance in the movie was better than his norm.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance is, albeit brief, poignant and in good keeping with his usual high standard of performance.  Connie Nielsen does a wonderful job of playing a Provost Marshall.  With actors of such high caliber and a high profile director like John McTiernan, whose work includes \\"Die Hard\\", \\"Predator\\", \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" and other such high profile films; this movie does move along at a high pace and it is a well told story.<br />Conceptually this movie is highly plausible, the plot is well written, the actor's performances are well done and the soundtrack is well suited to the movie.  I do have one major problem with this film though.  Without searching the credits, I'm going to have to make one of two assumptions about whether or not the filmmakers hired a technical consultant with knowledge about the United States Army or not.  I'm guessing here that they didn't hire one because if they did, they wouldn't have had a scene where Samuel L. Jackson is wearing BDU's (Battle Dress Uniform), yelling and screaming at his soldiers, with them calling him Sergeant and then you look at his collar and he's wearing the rank of a Specialist, which is a junior enlisted member, \\"below\\" the rank of Sergeant.  Later of course, he's wearing the stripes of a Master Sergeant which would be in accordance with how he was being addressed.  Then there is the issue of a Ranger squad having a female as a member.  While the films producers addressed this, quite briefly, in one of the special features, where they basically said that they knew she didn't belong, but they threw her in the bargain anyway.These two issues and the \\"soldiers\\" referring to their ruck sacks as packs, instead of \\"ruck,\\" blew a lot of this films credibility with me, a soldier with several years in the Army.<br />The premise:<br />Samuel L. Jackson plays a Ranger Master Sergeant, in Panama, prior to our pulling out that country, and he's in charge of training what looks like a platoon of Rangers in jungle warfare.  As the movies main title rolls, we see Jackson and a squad of his, in a Huey (an aircraft long since relegated to the National Guard), flying over the canal, preparing to drop in and run an exercise, all the while, a hurricane is raging around them.  The scene cuts to another helicopter searching for the Ranger squad which is well over due for their check in and then they spot one Ranger carrying another and being shot at by another of the Rangers.  Here is where the murder/mystery kicks in and the Colonel, played by Tim Daly, calls in John Travolta to interrogate the witnesses to determine what happened out there in the field.<br />What follows from this point is an intriguing movie that gets rather fascinating as the plot carries forward and you're trying to figure out \\"whodunit.\\"  Outside of the \\"annoyances\\" of improper Army uniforms, terminology and tactics, this movie is good film to watch.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />- Director's Commentary<BR>- Filmographies<BR>- Theatrical Trailers<br />- Featurettes:<BR>* Basic:  A Director's Design<BR>* Basic Ingredients:  A Writer's Perspective
B00000DC7J|5.0|The first i bought and by far the best of PIazzola's nuevo tango record i heard. The sound is great and there is no single piece that will stuck in your mind for a long long time.<BR>An all time classic. Not for dancers ofcourse but certainly for passionate nights.
1558908846|3.0|Based on the DC Comic; this film adaptation of Judge Dredd doesn't fully display the heart of the comic it is adapted from, but on it's own it's mindless fun with none other than Sylvester Stallone in the title role.  Stallone is as stoic as ever for the first half of the film, and seems to have a lot of fun in his role, while Armand Assante chews the scenery as Dredd's nemesis Rico, while a pre-Unfaithful Diane Lane puts on a good show as well.  It's completely mindless; but thanks to some nicely assembled action scenes, impressive special effects, and a great tightly knit cast (including Rob Schneider, Max Von Sydow, Jurgen Prochnow, Joan Chen, and Balthazar Getty), Judge Dredd is better than it is reputed to be; and with the recent wave of comic licensed films to hit theaters, I find it better than The Hulk.
B00005R24K|5.0|The Evil Dead is one of the true Hall of Fame cult classics in the field of horror, a movie more than justified in billing itself as \\"the ultimate in grueling horror.\\"  Its pervasive influence is felt strongly even today, and the movie stands as a primer on how to do terror most effectively.  There are very few movies that I consider truly scary, but this low-budget Sam Raimi masterpiece of gory terror managed to delightfully tweak my hard-to-find fright nerves on several occasions.  I was scrabbling to return light to my darkened room as soon as the end credits appeared.  High school buddies Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, with the help of Robert Tapert, took their work very seriously, studying the reaction of drive-in horror movie audiences to see what works and what does not work in this type of film.  This research made them wise beyond their early twenty-something years, as they committed themselves to a creed of \\"the gore the merrier,\\" never letting up for a second once the real horror began.<br />Raimi, Campbell, and Tapert parlayed a sixteen hundred dollar thirty minute film called Within the Woods into a three hundred fifty thousand dollar investment venture to make this film, originally called Book of the Dead.  They led a small group of visionaries, including the unforgettable ladies of Evil Dead, into the cold Tennessee wilderness and proceeded to make, sometimes almost on the fly, one of the most effective, unrelenting scary movies of all time.  As the story goes, five young people, two men and three women, travel deep into the countryside to a run-down cabin for reasons never explained, discovering far more than a mysterious tape recording and obviously infernal book bound in human skin in the cellar.  The tape reveals the voice of a supposed scientist who had come to this desolate spot along with his wife to study the ancient Sumerian Book of the Dead which he had discovered.  Foolishly, he records himself reading the ancient tongue of the books demonic conjurations, and even more foolishly Ashley \\"Ash\\" Williams (Bruce Campbell) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) play these words, unknowingly calling forth from the earth an evil more ancient and terrifying than anything they could ever have imagined.  Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), having earlier witnessed undeniable manifestations of something not good underneath the cellar door, foolishly goes out into the night in search of whomever she knows it out there, finding only a forest of trees seemingly alive and determined to rape her.  After finding her way back to the cabin, she is the first person to be possessed by the appropriately named Evil Dead, and she delivers what is to me the most satisfying attack in a movie bursting at the seams with one attack after another.  One by one, as the terrifying night unfolds, the quintet of friends are possessed and changed into disgustingly foul demons, until only one gore-encrusted survivor is left to battle his former friends for a life that can no longer even seem worth living.<br />I went into this film somewhat questioning the power of its legendary heritage, but once the first zombification scene rolled around, I knew that The Evil Dead was going to fully live up to its dark promise.  These poor ladies, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker, and Theresa Tilly, let the makeup artists do anything to them, and they willingly and enthusiastically turned themselves into the sickest of creatures.  I can hardly imagine how much Karo syrup was procured for this production, as the blood and gore just kept coming nonstop.  The fight for survival led to the brutal use of axes, fingers to the eyes, shotguns, planks, everything within reach of the victims in that truly creepy little cabin in the dark woods.  Bruce Campbell took some time to grow into his role, but once his wimpy character saw what he had to do if he were to have any chance of surviving, he turned in a magnificent performance, exhibiting fear and loathing as well as any horror movie actor I have ever had the demented joy of watching.<br />The Evil Dead is a landmark horror film that all fans of the genre should be required to see, preferably in the darkest, more fear-enducing environment possible.  Having it available on DVD in widescreen format is wonderful in and of itself, but this DVD (ASIN B00005R24K) comes with extras to further delight the gore-lovers out there.  You get the theatrical trailer, four TV spots, a poster and still gallery, impressively lengthy cast and crew biographies, a Ladies of the Evil Dead booklet containing modern interviews with the movie's intrepid female stars, outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage, and not one but two audio commentaries for the film, one with writer/director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert and one with legendary star Bruce Campbell.  The Evil Dead is a horror fan's most demented dream come true.e actor I have ever had the demented joy of watching.  <br />The Evil Dead is a landmark horror film that all fans of the genre should be required to see, preferably in the darkest, more fear-enducing environment possible.

B0000028UK|5.0|After the massive and momumental success of &quot;Ten&quot;, Pearl Jam followed up with &quot;Vs.&quot;; an album that not only managed to come out of the shadow of the preceding album, but almost eclipses it.  From the opening rocker &quot;Go&quot; to the radio smashes and fan favorites &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Glorified G&quot;, &quot;Daughter&quot;, &quot;Dissident&quot;, and &quot;Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town&quot;, this album is a winner from beginning to end.  Eddie Vedder's soulful voice sounds better here than he did on &quot;Ten&quot;, and the production is lightly better as well.  Though it wouldn't achieve the monumental commercial success that &quot;Ten&quot; did, &quot;Vs.&quot; was an instant hit with Pearl Jam fans as what many consider their best album.  While I don't find it as great as I found &quot;Ten&quot; to be, this is still an fantastic album that is lightyears beyond most of the mainstream &quot;hard rock&quot; found today, and if you don't believe me then maybe you should give this a listen.
B000066796|3.0|I like Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman, so I figured seeing the two in a movie would be pretty interesting.  Well, as far as romantic comedies go, this one was okay.  Meg Ryan's charachter was pretty flat and typical, but Hugh Jackman really stole the show, playing the duke from 1876 who travels forward in time by accident.  The plot is sort of cheesy, and i didn't really think their falling in love was convincing.  <br />Kate & Leopold is a fun movie to watch if you have some freetime or something, but don't be expecting the whole \\"you'll laugh, you'll cry\\" thing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|For the person who posted ''i dont get what all the fuss is and she only had one good song '' 0_o .. you obviously didnt listen to the cd and shouldnt be posting otherwise . This cd has an effect to put me in a daze and makes me calm . If you are looking for death metal or rock music , go elsewhere .This is a beautiful cd with many good songs , that have good meaning and lyrics.
B000002TQV|5.0|PERFECT!  Not a song on The Bends that isn't mind blowing. I would go on about this album forever so I'll make it short - BUY IT, BUY IT RIGHT NOW AND BE FOREVER CHANGED!
B00005JL78|5.0|I had seen AI shortly before this and thought that movie was boring,  I was sorely disappointed.  I went in to this thinking it was going to be similar - but it was great!  It's about a police officer in the future, working in a unit called &quot;Pre-Crime.&quot;  They have the ability to see crimes of the future due to these three pre-cognitive beings.  When the message comes that the main character (Tom Cruise) is the next murderer, he has to rush to clear his name.  The story has a lot of suspense and twists, but not too many to make it laughable.  I thoroughly enjoyed it - I bought the DVD as soon as it came out!
B000002UJQ|5.0|What is there to say about OK Computer? Just allow me to tell you this- the hype exists for a reason!  Give this record a try and it will change your life (I don't care how corny that sounds, it's true!).  Don't expect to completely understand this album's brilliance immediately, though, give it a few listens.  I promise it will be worth your while!
B00000K31Q|4.0|I like this movie a lot.  I saw it in the theaters and have the DVD.  It's a teen love story based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew (loosely based!).  The story is about the shrew (Kat/Julia Stiles) and her sister Bianca.  The new boy in town wants to date Bianca, but Bianca can't date unless Kat does.  So he hatches a plan to get Kat hooked with someone so that he can date Bianca.<br />I think the story is cute, and I completely fell for Heath Ledger's character, Patrick (the guy who gets paid to date Kat).  He and Julia Stiles are great in this movie - the other characters, however, leave a lot to be desired.  I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would WANT to date Bianca. Sure, she's pretty - but she's got no personality until the very end.  It's not bad though, since most of the story revolves around Kat and Patrick who are well developed characters with a lot of chemistry.<br />Not the greatest movie on the planet, but definitely fun as a light-hearted and humorous date movie. :)
0385507755|5.0|[Betrayed as we all were by an irresponsible author, I refrain from deleting this review, originally written and posted in 2003, leaving it online only on a \\"for what it's worth\\" basis.]    This is an extraordinary story: a young man suicidally addicted to drugs/alcohol, consumed by rage and psychic pain, finds the will to survive and the power to conquer his addiction without the 12-step program and its manipulative insistence on believing in a \\"higher power of your own understanding\\". At the end of the book we find out about what happened to all the people we had come to know, and those who have not read the book and intend to read it should read here no further. Frey survives, as do two other strugglers. What they have in common is their wealth, their elevated position in life, or the wealth that is behind them, not their commitment to the twelve steps. All the others, those who relapsed after leaving the program, are poor, working class, or modest middle class. Their lives are destroyed. Frey's trip through the rehabilitation program is harrowing: major anesthesia-free dental work, other patients' brutality and threats, despair, his continuing rage and psychic torment. The counselors warn him that only through the 12-step program can anyone have a chance of staying off substances, but through tremendous innate personal strength, the support and professionalism of some of the staff, and the love of his supportive if dysfunctional family, he manages to do so. The writing is poetic, the characters deeply-drawn, the story gripping and believable, even though some circumstances are so gruesome or horrific they are beyond the experience of all but the most desperate.  The story of Frey's Orpheus-like journey through hell makes a deep mark on one's awareness of the depths of human despair and the potential for heroism.
0800141849|5.0|What I like in this movie is the idea of love _ the psychological factors. (I won't like it if I watched it 10 years ago.) Although there are several places with exaggeration in this movie, the two main charactors Rose and Greg are still very fascinating. This is a serious movie, but also a comedy. That's Streisand's brilliance.<BR>If you don't like this movie, what's so good about A Beautiful Mind?! I think Striensand did a better job here.<br />Also, this movie is not about who is more beautiful. So, it's no need to compare Striesand with some other beautiful women. It tells the psychological changes in lovers. With Greg, Rose  becomes more confident. The last part of the story is the only consequence of a true love.<br />Jiff Bridges played very well in this movie. What I don't agree is that he got so mad at students after Rose left.
0066214122|4.0|The Andromeda Strain had terrifying insights into what space exploration could hold. Jurassic Park gave common readers new light into the thrills and mishaps of genetic engineering. Timeline allowed us to see into the past and develope an understanding of quantum physics and mechanics. Through all of this, Crichton has shown the readers his goal to learn new advances, and explain them to usin terms we can understand. In Prey, he does not disappoint.<BR>As with all of his novels, Crichton gives us the human side, and the technological side of his story. This book even further advances the former, as it is written in first person. This tends to lead more mystery to the readings as, unlike other works, we are confined to what the main character knows.<BR>Now, this book gives us much the presence of Sphere as through the majority, we are focused on a small group of people in a confined area where, pretty much, all hell breaks lose. The book focuses on a span of seven days. The action of the novel takes place on the sixth day, where the revelations are revealed and we learn what he has been leading up to.<BR>The only flaw with this book is the dialogue, where Crichton tneds to rush it and make it seem as if, despite their intelligence, the characters talk almost as if they were children in arguments.<BR>The descriptions of the events and surroundings are astounding, and the reader can see everything in their minds clearly. The story-telling is smooth and even, never missing a beat. The reader may not enjoy the interruptions for the explanations of the technical jargon, but the way the novel is paced out, these can be passed over without missing much in the way of story.<BR>The best part, however, of the book, in my opinion, is the fact that these nanocreatures are based on programs written off of animal behaviorisms, and Crcihton does not forget this when he describes the actions of the nanoparticles.<BR>Above all else, buy this book for he ending. if you are like me, you will pick up on the \\"big surprise,\\" but the ending will still surprise you, and will even go to demonstrate how human behavios can show up in human creations.<BR>This book is full of twists, deception, surprises, and revelations. It will make the readers wonder how far our technology will go and what the consequences will be. in my case, in made me interested in nanotechnology. Once again, this book lost a star for the dialogue, but that makes up so little of the real story.<BR>I hope this review was useful, and I hope that if you buy this book, you enjoy it. I know I did.
B00001IVOF|5.0|I don't know if you agree with me or not but \\"hell on earth\\" is by far ? THE most agressive hip hop album to ever be realesed... Im i right or wrong ?

B00008DDXC|1.0|Honestly, I have to ask this question. What happened to the quality of the movies? I am a huge fan of the books. I adore them. They explained a lot, and they met my expectations each time, getting steadily better and better than its predecessor. However, this is not the case with the movies. During the first one I thought at the end, \\"Okay...this is just what you expected, right?\\" Hardly any good book is transformed into a good movie, with the possible execption of Lord of the Rings. Take Flowers for Algernon, for example. An exciting book about a person recieving mental enhancment, but then IQ going back down at the end was a memorable book. You felt the sadness that Charlie felt, you feel the frustration, the hopelessness. However, when a movie was made, you couldn't feel anything. Not that the actors were bad though. I meant the whole point of the movie was being snuffed. Thinking this, I then went to the second movie with a feeling of the fact that it was going to be better. <br />Harry Potter 2, though, was even worse. I snorted, scoffed, and raised my eyebrows so frequently during the movie that they were in danger of disappearing completely. Let's start from the beginning. Dobby, a Gollum-like character, with jerky movements that clearly indicate that he was computer generated, shows up and starts talking like Jar Jar Binks. The Weasleys look like a normal family, no idication whatsoever of being poor. And when they start to fly the car, there are PEOPLE WALKING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM! And what was that bit about a character falling out of the car while flying and in danger of getting hit by a train?! Isn't that a little dramatic? Might I add that Hogwarts looks like a forbidding jail? Skipping ahead to the Herbology lesson, why is it that Professor Sprout talks with the earmuffs on? Wouldn't you hear the cries of the Mandrake too? And WHY did Draco Malfoy stick his finger in a Mandrake's mouth? Also, when Harry was reading Riddle's diary, why was there an elongated NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Now the scene with the basilisk. First of all, it looks like a dinosaur. Its gigantic, luminous yellow eyes were transformed into tiny, beady, red eyes. And what happened to speaking Parseltongue? Why is Riddle yelling at the snake in English? Plus, there were not that many tunnels in the Chamber of Secrets and Harry did NOT climb the statue and almost kill himself with his own idiocy. Enough with the storyline.<br />The characters were extremely two dimensional. They had no other feelings. Take Harry, for example. He has two faces, one with a toothy grin, the other a glaring scowl. Hermione is perpetually annoying, and Ron has no lines. (I thought the casting with Hermione was pretty bad too. I expected her to be funny looking and ugly) Draco tries too hard, but Lucius Malfoy was actually pretty good. What happened to the ghosts? Peeves and Professor Binns? *Maybe they were this way because of the director.<br />What about the music and the theme? Music: It was horrible and repetitive. I couldn't tell the difference, and for all I know, they're going to use the same music for the entire series! I suggest Brian Tyler, composer and director of the music in Chilren of Dune. He also won an award for the music he did in The Fast and the Furious. Theme: All I got was \\"Win!!!\\" and \\"Evil people are everywhere and usually are about as obvious having signs saying 'I'm evil'!\\" Where was the message about love saving you from evil?<br />Other things: They tried to make this funny. Why would they try to make it funny?!?! They have the characters saying extra lines that are not only cheesy but are also designed to make a five year old laugh, and only five year olds. And, this is crude humor. I tolerated some of the things, but honestly! During the scene with the Floo Powder, Harry clearly says \\"Diagon Alley!\\" and then the lines \\"What did he say?\\" \\"I don't know. Diagonally?\\" made it a little too much. An obvious indication that they were trying toohard. Rowling herself makes the books funnier in the future by adding wit...not crude humor. This was a series mistake.<br />Overall, I thought the movie was pretty bad. Maybe there is still hope with director Cuaron.
B000002I2M|5.0|Great recording , Essential Doors.
B000002GVO|5.0|The Eagles struck gold with this one.  They got a little bit heavier and less countrified than their previous releases, but they did not lose their soulful harmonies.  This release had some of the most well known and well done material of their carrer.  Of course everybody knows the classic title track and Life in the Fast Lane.  But this also has other great tracks such as Wasted time, New Kid in Town, Victim of Love and one of Don Henley's first songs about politics, environmentalism and religion, at least that is what I thought It was about, The Last Resort.  This album should be a very satisfying listen for anybody who truly likes music.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Another great movie by the Coen Brothers and one of my favorite works of theirs. This film is hilarious, and its somewhat confusing plot is absoulutly meaningless because of the great performances by Bridges and Goodman. Also, this film has some great supporting performances from John Turturro, Julianne Moore, and especially Phillip Seymour Hoffman whose mannerisms never cease to make eee laugh uncontrollably.
B000063DFS|5.0|On this record, Ozzy's voice came through like thunder, but it is Zakk Wylde's guitar playing that made this album. His playing sounds beefy and very organic, yet technically proficient at the same time. The man is truly a purist.  The opening to Mr. Tinkertrain was great.  Other standouts on this album are Desire, No More Tears, SIN, Zombie Stomp (silly), Road to Nowhere, and Don't Blame Me.  The best thing about Ozzy Osbourne in my eyes has always been the guitar players, like Randy Rhoads and Jake E. Lee before him Zakk Wylde is no exception to that.  It is the combination of Ozzy's singing, the writing style of the band and Zakk Wylde's guitar playing that make this album badass.
B000005IRG|5.0|Television's debut masterpiece &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; is not only one of the best albums of the late 1970's New York punk scene, however, it is one of the best albums in rock history. The dual guitar solos from Richard Lloyd and Tom Verlaine are absoulutely magnificent and they prove that punk rock is not simply a loud three-chord riot.<br />The album opens with one of its finest songs: &quot;See No Evil&quot;. It is followed by yet another great the intricate &quot;Venus&quot;. This is followed by another rocker &quot;Friction&quot;. Then comes the song which the album is named after and the best example of why Television was such an amazing band &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;. This song is quite simply ten minutes of pure bliss. The dual guitar solos working back and forth have their own styles and completely flow perfectly together. This songs sheer brilliance is not to damper the following four songs which continue the masterpiece.<br />The joy and originality of this album can not simply be put into words so buy it immediately to experience the manifesto of Television.
B00005JM09|1.0|I can't understand the fuss about T3. If you can willingly suspend your disbelief and accept it, you don't have any strong beliefs to begin with. It just doesn't hang together. Never mind the way T-X manages to remotely control vehicles that have manually operated steering, accelerators, and brakes. (If there are no servo controls, there's no remote control). Never mind the fact that she controls them remotely when she has no visual feedback on what they are doing. (Or are we to believe that she programmed the puny CPUs in the vehicles so that they could behave intelligently and in cooperation with each other.) Never mind that we have to accept a giant construction crane being driven like a sports car. (Have you ever been stuck behind one of those things in traffic?) The real groaner comes at the end. Let's see now. Skynet is operating on a distributed computer system that involves nearly every networked computer in the world, right? So what's the first thing it does? It blows up the cities that contain all those computers, as well as the control centers for the networks. And what little is left isn't hardened, so it'll get wiped out by the electromagnetic pulse. If Skynet lobotomozes itself by destroying nearly all the computers in the world and the way they communicate, how does it remain operational in order to plague humans after Judgement Day? The whole premise of the movie is brain dead! Science fiction should at least attempt to follow a cohesive view of the world it creates. This movie can't even make sense with itself.
B000000OEI|4.0|It's been used in a dozen trailers, most prominently in the ID4 trailer. And why not? Hans Zimmer created 2 of the most powerful themes in the past decade for this movie. It's so empowering that it'll fill you with confidence and defiance.<br /><br />There are only 5 tracks on this CD (all horribly out of order and with incorrect titles) even though it lasts over an hour (the longest track is almost 25 minutes long). It was a bad mistake by Hollywood Records to organise the CD this way as you have to skip thru a lot of tension/filler music (this CD has plenty of exactly that) to get to the good bits.<br /><br />There is an extended score out there featuring an additional 10 minutes of music, it has a blue cover instead of a red one and has a correct track listing in chronological order. As follows:<br /><br />1. Opening/Conflict/Alabama-9:42<br />2. Resurrection-9:47<br />3. Little Ducks-2:03<br />4. 1SQ (Alternate)-11:09<br />5. Mutiny-8:58<br />6. Day 12-5:44<br />7. Three, Two, One-1:54<br />8. 3:00/1SQ-16:09<br />9. November 2nd/2SQ-2.32<br />10. End Titles-7:33<br /><br />Total Time 75:55<br /><br />It's a more complete package but a little hard to find so you might have to make do with the commercial release. Still a great purchase and I highly recommend.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|i do think they deserve their title as musicians.  while they do work the lesbian gimmick (and it is a gimmick-read any recent interview-they love men.  women are just pretty), they have some serious talent.  on top of their singing ability, they have come up with several stuck-in-your-head songs.  ever try to listen to all the things she said before you go to sleep?  youll be hearing it when you wake up.  overall, a four-star album.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Everyone in the world must own this CD. It has like some of THE BEST music that will ever exist on it. Ennio Morricone is an absolute genius and it's his score to this movie that inspired Hans Zimmer to be a film composer. Tracks like Falls, Vita Nostra and Remorse will make your life complete. It for reasons like this that music exists.<br /><br />You must get this CD, it will take you to another world, it'll make you sad, it'll make you happy. It's joyous, it's morose. It's an immortal part of history. The Mission can me matched, but it will never be bettered.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick is a complete masterpiece from start to finish.  This was just unimaginable for 1972.  Being a Tull fan with everything up to and including Aqualung, Jethro Tull was just the best in the early to mid 70's.  I can remember buying the vinyl for 6 bucks and not even looking at the song selection cause there was no need to, it was Tull!!!!   Well, I can't tell you what took place when I put on the album and then noticed it was a long song, then looked deeply into the cover and was amazed that there is one long song diveded into two parts.  For 1972, this was pretty amazing.<br />So I began listening and was just sweeped off of my feet.  The most catchy melodies began to get into my head over the next few weeks, years, and decades.  The first part just starts with Ian and his guitar and slowly builds into one of the most amazing pieces of work ever, this includes styles of Classical, medeval, and old English melodies and all build to a most emotional climax and just carries you away, and that is only the first part.  The second starts with a familar melody again and the first few minutes of part two are very intense, then into a beautiful orchestrated part.  The ending 10 minutes of part two should bring tears to your eyes or fill you with emotions unbound.  <br />It is really hard to put into words what this means to me over 30 years, just listen and experience the beauty for yourself.  This is the most ambitious album in the Tull catalog and it's unbelievable how they can write, or even play something of this magnitude.  This is also the most progressive that Tull has ever been and feaures hands down the best keyboard melodies in the Tull cannon besides all the other instruments, how can one wriyte something like this, simply a masterpiece
B00008HCCF|5.0|It's great!  If you're a fan, I suggest you buy this DVD! What more can I say?
B000002GQK|5.0|Growing up in the early 70's, The Moddy Blues were one of the 6 major progressive rock bands and had the whole collection.  Every Good Boy stand out for me as one of the best of the Moodys. The whole album just has a bit different sound then the other albums and when you play a certain song, you can tell it is from this album.  I am not sure if it is meant to be a concept album, but to me, it all flows together and each song is just great. The sounds the band gets on this album really are great with the mellotron choir sounds and flute, acoustic guitar and vocals.  I think what sets this album apart from the other Moddy's albums for me is the way the vocals are mixed, multi-vocal parts almost in each and every song and are fantastic.For starters, am radio played The Story in your eyes and was and still is one of the greatest songs ever written, a three minute intense whirlwind of a tune and my fav on the album. I think what did it for me with this album is the first song Procession, it includes some chants and great flute and is just mystical and magical and a great opening number.  The third song is a great Ray Thomas tune that is also one of my favs on the record called Our Guessing Game and is filled with great vocals all over and very emotional and upbeat.  Emily's Song is a beautiful mellow song and very heartfelt. After You Came is also a fantastic song and in the vein of The Story in your Eyes with great acoustic and flute and lead guitar, a great one.<BR>One More Time to Live slows things down a bit and evokes parts of the first song, Procession and is mezmerizing. Nice to be hear is a happy song and extremely catchy and again, includes great vocal parts. You can Never Go Home is a laid back song with the vocals making it a definate highlight.  To end it all is a great one called My Song.  It starts quiet and builds into a great symphonic section and then is quiet and before you know it, it build again, another fav from the album.<BR>Again, this album does it for me more then any other Moody;s albums, it just all flows together into one piece and is the most emotional lyrical albums I believe the Moody's ever did.  The way the music and songs build and change are just wonderful, a beautiful and powerful journey.
0671042858|5.0|Okay for all of you people who didn't like this book you clearly are just not people who like actual literature you just wait until the novel comes on paperback and pick it up while you're in the line in the grocery store. For the rest of you this story chilled me to the bone and brought me close to tears more than once. In this story you are introduced to Trish who wanders away from her mother while on a hike and becomes lost in the Maine woods. This may sound simple but as the story unfolds you are pulled into the mind of this very young and terrified girl, especially if you have ever been lost in the woods yourself. Every aspect of the woods begins to frighten her and as she becomes more lost, sick and terrified your emotions mount with them, making this an incredibly hard book to put down and an even harder one to forget about.
B000024C7W|5.0|One word - &quot;Ecclesiastes.&quot;  Perhpas the most hauntingly beautiful song ever recorded by Stevie Wonder, &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot; is actually just one of many beautiful tracks from this double CD.  Originally panned by critics (but what do they know about music anyway), this soundtrack of a never released film is finally receiving the ciritcal acclaim it deserves.  Of course, fans knew the truth all along.  Other standout tracks include &quot;Black Orchid&quot; and &quot;Come Back As A Flower&quot;, another one of Stevie's musical tributes to the concept of reincarnation (much like &quot;Higher Ground&quot;)- but it works.  If you are a true Stevie fan, consider your collection incomplete without this fabulous double CD.  Why are you still reading this, go buy it now!
B000060P79|5.0|this cd is amazing if your thinking about buying it just ake my advice and get it i dont know how i lived without it
B00001NFCY|5.0|Ok so Scotts and Eddies voices are similiar and you can see grunge influences with Creed. But what band hasnt been influenced by some other? Its only when you listen to a creed album thouroughly you can see that they sound nothing like Pearl Jam. They are much heavier and darker.<BR>                                            The annoying thing about Creed is that everyone hates them because of the singles they hear on the radio 24-7. Creed always release they're softest and most commercial songs as singles and when you hear other songs from their albums like 'Faceless man' and 'Are you ready?' from this one you will be blown away by their power, sincerity and melody. This album is a rock masterpiece. Creed deserve their success because they are once of the most awesome and talented rock bands in the world who have the guts to let themselves be known.
B00006879E|5.0|I bought this cd the other day and I have not taken it out of my cd player since. I have not even bothered to turn on the radio for the past 3 days. This cd is THAT GOOD. You won't be disapointed if you buy this. I promise. <BR>Maroon 5 is on there way to the big time. Way to go guys!<br />If you only buy one cd this year BUY Maroon 5  -  Songs About Jane!!!!
B000069AUI|4.0|I have an unfortunate tendency to dismiss most modern music as the product of an industry that usually subverts originality in favor of meeting perceived marketing and demographic expectations. Even after listening to &quot;Parachutes,&quot; Coldplay's masterful, Grammy-winning album, I was still skeptical. How many bands have followed great debuts with poor secondary efforts--the almost inevitable sophomore slump? I needn't have worried. <br />Certainly, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is in many ways similar to &quot;Parachutes.&quot; If you're expecting something that redefines the genre--a &quot;Nevermind,&quot; if you will--it's not here. What one gets from &quot;Rush&quot; is a highly polished, more mature version of &quot;Parachutes,&quot; an effort that is reminiscent of both the Verve and Incubus (but without some of the pretensions). There'a also some of the mature song structures that marked Rush's works of the late 70s (2112, A Farewell to Kings, and Hemispheres) as some of the finest of the prog-rock era. One knows that one is in for something special when the opening track, &quot;Politik,&quot; greets you with what reminds me of Phil Spector's &quot;wall of sound,&quot; a blast of strings, keys, and guitars that somehow remains coherent and harmonious throughout the opening segment...and that's when Chris Martin takes over. On &quot;Parachutes&quot; his vocal work was largely reminiscent of the Rob Thomas/Eddie Vedder style that so many seem to utilize these days. It was a fine effort, but overly familiar (though appropriate when one considers the themes of &quot;Parachutes&quot;). Here, he comes of age, with a vocal effort that shows remarkable range and emotional depth. Some have compared his vocals to those of Jeff Buckley and Fran Healy--high praise, indeed. If &quot;Parachutes&quot; was a great ensemble piece, then &quot;Rush&quot; features the emergence of Martin a vocal talent to be reckoned with. <br />Most people are now familiar with&quot;Clocks,&quot; the dynamic single that is probably the album's standout track (though &quot;Yellow&quot; from &quot;Parachutes&quot; is still their best song). It has energy and drive to spare, with a wonderful, sure-to-be-imitated piano lead. But other tracks are worthy of note, as well: The aforementioned &quot;Politik&quot; and the excellent &quot;The Scientist.&quot; are also first-rate; truthfully, there's not a bad track on the album (but some are better than others). As a whole, this may be the best sophomore effort from any band in ages. True, it isn't revolutionary or genre-defining. But it's still a very worthy effort, and is highly recommended.

B00008R9KF|5.0|I just watched this movie twice in the last twelve hours, and as I couldn't stop thinking about it, I thought I would write a review. For me the thing that makes \\"My Beautiful Laundrette\\" so memorable is the intentional ambiguity of the film. When you have finished watching it, you're not sure what exactly the director is trying to say to you - this is not a shallow Hollywood creation. The movie paints stunning portraits of race relations between the Pakistani and English denizens of London, the conflict between women and men, between the working and middle classes, between fascists and communists, the independent-minded, and the family-oriented, the straight and the gay. But the movie doesn't focus on any of one of these issues and presents, instead, a collage that is more composed of questions than answers.<BR>   Also amazing is the movie's depiction of a gay relationship - the film doesn't dwell on the sexual orientation of its characters, it simply presents them as they are, with no commentary of any sort - there is no coming out, no discussing \\"the relationship\\", and no tears. Nor do words like gay or queer even appear in the film. The boys' physicality acts instead as a backdrop to the other events and thoughts in the movie, complicating matters further. Scenes depicting emotion are beautifully written and filmed, as is everything else in the movie, but \\"My Beautiful Laundrette\\" seems to have been able to show something Hollywood has yet to: that The Relationship is not always the focus of life, wether it be straight, gay, or indifferent.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|Even though the DVD isn't out yet, I've seen the movie several times and just love it. Cat and her dad move into a haunted house and Cat becomes friends with Casper the Friendly Ghost. It's a must see movie for everyone.
B000089RVX|2.0|There is a lot of hype and confusion regarding this album as many do not realise that it isn't original and it is derivative of other styles that have been present outside of the musical mainstream for some time now. Musically Evanescence roughly fall into the European-pop-metal gothy thing that HIM, Lullacry, Lacuna Coil have done for years, adding shades of the current nu-metal sound.  The band seems to be going for a dark rock feel but end up creating a weepy gothic melodrama which is often the case with lesser bands attempting this style of music. Amy Lee does have a decent voice but that doesn't make her a good singer as there is little variety to her excessivly weepy approach. The rest of the band is barely adequate and fail to excite or provide anything to vary the monotny that they are have created. The guitars and drums sound thin and the album runs out of steam rapidly after the 3rd or fourth track. I have great difficulty sitting through the whole thing without getting irritated. This band is fine for a few singles and movie soundtracks, but not in creating an interesting album or music.
B00005JM03|5.0|I loved this movie. There are great performances from many great actors. There were also a few laughs during the movie.  I don't really know how to tell you what it's about without giving anything away, but it was a great movie, and I suggest you at least check it out!
0307120007|3.0|Fun for a baby to touch and smell the different pages.  Board book form allows it to be read easily using one hand.  Exactly the same book I enjoyed as a kid.  Rips apart more easily than I would like.
0783225857|4.0|What can one say about this fantastic story?  The movie is an excellent adaptation of a book that was way ahead of its time.  Although it leaves out what I consider some pretty pivotal points from the novel, it does well with what it can for lack of time and space (if it included everything from the novel it would be 4 hours long!)<br />My only gripe is not about the film itself but about the listing. Amazon.com lists COLOR as a special feature format of this collectors edition.  I think it is excellent as a black/white film but thought it would be interesting to see it in color.  I was disappointed to find out that actually, viewing it in color is NOT an option at all.  I'm sure no one would mind if it wasn't in color but Amazon should not falsely tell people that color is a viewing option when it is not.<br />This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 stars.

I've found this to be the most fun I've ever had learning how to do things in 15 minute sprints.  I'm a full time employee with a hubby, kids, and pets along with my lingering illness.  This book has taught me more than I had ever hoped for, and a fun way to enjoy doing it.  I'm very thankful that this book and those emails are available or I'd still be in CHOAS.  My hat is off to flylady and her following speaks for itself.  I think anybody who doesn't follow it is not ready to make a change in their life.  I was able to toss out all the other books on housekeeping which are too many to name since I've found Flylady.  It will work for anybody who needs it, it's just a matter of getting off that franny and incorporating it into your lifestyle.  :-)
B000066NW0|1.0|Why do people like her in the first place? \\"I think she's cool. And I love her style, it's so individual. She doesn't parade around in skimpy clothes like everyone else. Her success is based on the fact that she's a good musician, and that's admirable\\" - Heidi, 18 Whoa, wait! Let's break that down.<br />1. Avril DID NOT get her success based on her talent. She debuted on  MTV. She sold her soul to the devil when she signed that record contract, just like she's selling out. Her band was \\"given\\" to her, she didn't meet them.<br />2. Avril DOES wear skimpy clothes. Quote from the loser-\\"My ass-crack showing is my trademark\\".  She also walked around in a bikini. Quote the loser on Britney-\\"Who f*cking wears a bra down the street?\\" and \\"Britney Spears is such a hoe cake.\\" <br />3. Avril CANNOT play the guitar, or any other instrument for that matter. She never plays the guitar live, with one exception, and she warned her fans that she \\"totally sucks!\\" Her publicity shots with her guitar show her holding it the wrong way, and strumming non-existent chords. Her Complicated video shows her playing ONE chord, a G-chord, which isn't even in the song. She also has publicity photos of her playing the drums... Heh, she was holding one drumstick UPSIDE DOWN and make a fist around the other. She can't even hold them.. Her cd doesn't list her for guitar credits at all.<br />4. Avril DID NOT start any trends. She rode on existing trends, capitalizing on their popularity. I am angry that anyone would laud Avril for \\"bringing back the tie on girls\\". Alternative girls across the country have been wearing ties since the early 90s. The SPICE GIRLS, were wearing ties before Avril. Get this, Avril has a STYLIST. In fact, she has many stylists, ready to scout out another trend, making a comeback. She is the client of Stephanie Wolf, who goes and gets the ties etc. FOR Avril. <br />5. Avril CAN NOT skate. She could skate her way out of a gaping hole in a half pipe. Quoth the loser -\\"I like wiping out and hurting myself and crying. And I like to show off my bruises. And, me and the guys just like to mess around on them, even though we all suck.\\"<BR>\\"Dude, I suck,\\" is her typical response when asked about her shredding skills. \\"I mean, I like to skate, it's fun, but ... I like to do it in my free time. I don't want someone to shove a camera and a board in my face and be like, 'Here, let's see what everyone's talking about.' Because it's not like I'm a pro. I fall a lot, but I mean, everyone falls, you know.\\" -- from mtv.com <br />6. Avril IS incredibly RUDE and IMMATURE. She makes horrible comments on other popstars. She thought it would be funny to run away and play hide and seek from a new bodyguard that was being assigned to her. She flicks everyone off. She doesn't want preppies to listen to her music, and refused to autograph things for people dressed like \\"preppies\\" at her concert. She was rude accepting her VMA award, but then got drunk off her ass afterwards. She was kicked out of hotels for disturbing the other people there. She thought she was funny, and um, witty. She stole a strawberry from a hotel cart. (how bad ass...) She was acting stupid in a bar (she's 17, 18?) with Sum 41, trashed it, and thought it was funny when they gave her a wedgie.<BR>\\"The other night, I got into three fights,\\" says Lavigne. \\"I was at a club and some girl was giving me attitude. When people are drinking, they get mouthy. She pushed me, and I got her down on the floor. Security came, and because I was on top, they threw me out.\\" --from rollingstones.com <br />7. Avril's music SUCKS! She sounds like a  country singer, for the first part. In fact, she was supposed to be marketed as one. Her favorite band is Hanson. Then she tries, um, RAPPING? Next thing we know there'll be Shanikwa Lablingbling. Are her lyrics DEEP? hmmm... \\"She was a girl, he was a boy\\" blah blah blah complete [*]! She's not the cheerios in somebody's spoon, how deep!!! In \\"Mobile\\" she complains about having to go on tour, and other crap. This was written before she even became famous, how the hell would SHE know? <br />8. Avril is a COMPLETE DUMBASS! But what do you expect from a high school dropout who spells boy with an \\"i\\"? She looks like one too, underneath those 2 tons of whorish eye make-up. In her interview with YM, she was going on and on about getting married and other stupid fantasies of hers. She talked about the \\"thing the guy has to lift off of the girl's face to kiss her\\"... She doesn't know that it's called a veil?! She got fired from some chicken place, nobody really gives a [*], but then she had to sing a SONG about it.<br />9. Avril's PAST is a lie. She is just like Vanilla Ice, making up things to make her more hardcore. In reality, she was raised to be a christian school girl. She was a cheerleader. She sang at fairs. She sang COUNTRY music at those fairs. She wanted to be like Martina McBride or Shania Twain. Quoth her former manager- \\"She didn't know Blink 182 from Madonna\\". <br />10. Avril will not be, nor has ever been a SKATER PUNK. She is not skater, she is no punk. The two things are different, distinct movements/styles/musical genres and she is neither. She couldn't name a Ramones song to save her life! Yes, she DID say she was punk. She's even bared her undies, that read \\"Punk Princess\\". She's worn pins with \\"Kiss me, I'm Punk\\" on them. She's lied and conived and contradicted herself. She has, above all, said that she was punk. End of story. I don't buy her [*], 3 months later, when she takes everything back. After the backlash, the shameless little [*] poseur says \\"Oh, I didn't mean it THAT way...\\" Bull. <BR>\\"She is not a skateboarder; she is not a punk. She is not from the streets. She is from a middle-class family in Napanee. She is from a very safe neighbourhood,\\" \\"Skater? No. Punk? No. They've sold her out. The expectations are now that shes this [*], whos smashing her gutair in a slick video. Thats as programmed as anything else, and it's such teeny-bopper-trying-to-be-cool stuff. She's not a punk. Shes probably more contrived then Britney Spears ever was. Avril has the potential to be real, but right now, shes a poseur.\\" --Clint Fabri, Avril's former manager

B00008OWZC|5.0|Is there still anything to say about the recent LedZep releases of \\"How the west was won\\" CD and the DVD? Well maybe not, as almost all feedback Ive read is simply overwhelming, by celebrating this unique and wonderful live material of, Id say, the best rock group ever until today. But still, I do want to contribute a few sentences. From the first second of either the DVD and the CD there is no question about what youll expect the next hours: the absolute highlight of what the music world gave us to listen to: Led Zeppelin Live.<BR>The pure energy from the Immigrant Song (!What a voice!) to the acoustic set with an outstanding version of Bron-Y-Aur-Stomp... it just takes you to another place. But these products also prove that there is music out there which is \\"actual\\" at any time and cant be classified as \\"oh, something from the seventies...\\". It`s simply amazing. As I also can not resist to wonder whether a \\"reunion\\" (although J. Bonham is irreplacable!) would be great, I think that these musicians also deserve greatest respect to continue with their own projects whether as Page/Plant or separate. Check out the latest CD from Robert Plant (\\"Dreamland\\") and youll recognize that he still has something to say (sing) and his voice has developed into a mood which creates one of the most beautiful music around today (and the power is still there, no doubt about that!). Or listening to the two Page &amp; Plant projects from the 90ies, youll understand that these musicians are unique with their abilities to write songs. Its not about technique and never has been, its about the song, the mood, the feeling. Check out \\"Blue Train\\" or \\"When the World was Young\\" from the \\"Walking into Clarksdale\\" CD... it is mindblowing!<BR>Thanks to LedZep for these wonderful products that I cant get off my disk- and DVD player.<BR>And... \\"Hey, Mr.Page, please take another look whether you find some recordings from the 1977 tour but also of the European tour from 1980 as well...get it out, as whatever you may be able to give to us, it will make lots of people smile!..and you know that those concerts have been outstanding as well!\\")<BR>Okay, tastes are different, but to me, the latest Live LedZep CD and DVD are definitely the best rock products out there. <BR>LedZep rules!
B00006BTCA|5.0|they dont sound like joy division. it is said they got none of their influence from JD.  When i first heard them i loved them.  The thing i liked the most about them was their sense of complete style and direction over their music.  Hints of their influencers are so blended into their songs, they come out a completely different style.  and they're the best in concert too.  one of the best bands in a long time.
B00000IBRX|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most visually stunning films that I have ever experienced. It is magnificent, but without being overwhelming. Yet, I think that I would like it even if the camera work and effects were not so beautifully done. This is because I also find it the most thoughtful and mature film on the topic of the afterlife to ever come out of Hollywood.<br />The concept that we have to gradually overcome our preconceptions after death has the ring of truth to it. The metaphor of the art-loving Chris Nielsen seeing the afterlife as a great expressionistic canvas- until his guide rips through it to show him the next level is quite well done. This seeing beyond appearances and preconceptions to recognise our fellow beings as they really are is also quite profound. Personally, I enjoyed the fact that the deceased family dog seemed to be the only one that had no trouble adapting to his new surroundings.<br />Yet, this isn't a piece of new-age mind candy. Nielsen's wife's decent into despair after his death, followed by his epic quest into the depths of \\"hell\\" to rescue her, is positively mythological. I especially enjoyed Max Von Sydow as the the psychopomp guide (looking exactly like Carl Jung.)
031218087X|1.0|\\"Digital Fortress\\" hints at being a thinking man's technothriller - using codes and human intuition instead of fighter jets and nu-cue-ler subs.  Instead, it's full of implausible characters and uninspired plot twists, always seeming sure that it's much smarter than it really is.<br />THE PLOT:  a now dead computer programmer has created a seemingly unbreakable code, the eponymous \\"Digital Fortress\\", setting off a fierce hunt for its code key. While the key to DF is distributed on the internet, it's buried within the code itself.  Whoever unlocks the code will have access to the ultimate protection against decryption. Hostile governments, organized criminals or terrorists will be able to communicate freely over the internet completely immune to detection.  Fearing this, the NSA - the US agency responsible for gathering signals information and cracking codes - sends free-lance genius Dave Becker to Seville, where the programmer died. Trevor Strathmore, the NSA's head code breaker hopes that DF's creator left some clue to the code key behind.  Unfortunately, Becker isn't alone on his hunt...<br />Meanwhile, back at the NSA's high-tech HQ, Susan Fletcher, our hero's brilliant and sexy NSA genius of a girlfriend - tries picking up the mystery from her end of the Atlantic, where Strathmore's newest supercomputer is busy melting itself down trying to crack DF. Unfortunately, it looks like somebody is on Susan's trail as well - from the inside - and we get the hint that she shouldn't feel as safe as she does when Strathmore is around.  Back in Seville, Becker quickly learns that DF's creator had worn a ring when he died - but it's missing.  Quickly guessing that inscriptions on the ring say more than \\"one ring to rule them all\\", our hero tracks it across Spain, learning how quickly it moves from owner to owner.  Unfortunately, whoever owns the ring (even briefly) is marked for death by a mysterious assassin - a deaf killer who never misses, and catalogs his kills on a PalmPilot.<br />HOWEVER: I can't believe that this novel is as popular as reviewers make it sound. It's not only strikingly unintelligent, but strikingly arch.  Brown learned more about cryptography and the NSA than most people cared to hear about, and thus crafted a novel based on his \\"insider\\" info about cryptography.  (Brown's story heavily relies on a perceived ignorance of what the NSA stands for - an agency, he writes, that only a small percentage of Americans understand.  Rather than showing that Brown is a writer who has learnt what most us can't, \\"Digital Fortress\\" proves that Brown focuses on remote subjects not likely to have a large number of experts who can effectively challenge his pretensions of realism.  Actually, I learned more about cryptography while writing a paper about the Walker Family Spy Ring in high school, and most will probably learn more about the NSA watching \\"Sneakers\\" or \\"Good Will Hunting\\".  How do you like them apples?)  Instead of intelligent clues, Brown's story builds on arcane trivia (the etymology of the word \\"sincere\\", certain technical details distinguishing the different a-bombs used against Japan).  I was able to piece together some of Brown's clues, not because I'm smarter than most, but simply because I watch a lot of the History channel.<br />Getting past the \\"thrill\\" and \\"techno\\" aspects of the story, what's left is thin - Brown's ring-plot provides an excuse to send our hero across Seville, hunting the ring, making this less of a novel of any genre than a college-writing version of \\"Where I Went Last Summer\\" (complete with Spanish dialog repeated in English).<br />Brown's thin story is plumped, not with some redeeming characters of depth and intelligent plot turns, but with unbelievably stupid characters and unbelievable plot twists. Our hero is no action hero (he stays in shape playing racquetball), yet he manages to elude the hitman who has carved a path of precision-guided death across Seville.  Susan is beautiful andbrilliant - though Brown never leaves us doubting as to which half matters more (Susan is probably the least independent, most vulnerable, unintelligent and otherwise dated female character I've seen in any technothriller; even her smarts are just a convenient device to explain why she's working with the NSA.)  Strathmore is supposed to be a cryptographer par excellence, yet he defies belief - he's so obsessed with DF that he rams it into his super-codebreaking computer, bypassing security checks meant to protect it from viruses.  He does this despite knowing that DF is obviously more than it appears (its code for heaven's sake!!).  There's another NSA co-worker, a guy who's supposed to set off our alarm bells, but it's obvious that Brown only means him to distract us from Strathmore since Brown couldn't be bothered to come up with more characters.  Like Strathmore, the rest of the denizens of NSA headquarters are so dim, it's inconceivable that they'd be trusted to run a third rate ISP, let alone the most sophisticated code-breaking computer in the world.  (Typical for low-grade technothrillers, Brown is so obsessed credentialing his characters as geniuses, he devotes little time to writing them even slightly smart.)<br />By the climax, I couldn't care whether the NSA would be destroyed by the killer code, mostly because the author had by then changed from telling a story to giving a pitch for some splashy action movie, making the novel's Hollywood aspirations annoyingly clear. In short, storm some other fortress.

B00006F7S4|5.0|A friend of mine turned me on to this cd and I was not dissapointed. Though this may be the saddest album ever recorded, it still appeal to me musically. This cd shows clearly what I feel is the first and last reason to create any form of music, it tells a story. Beck did not write these songs just to sell cd's and make music, he sings from the heart and that is where all great works of art, and i consider this a work of art, come from. Works like this are the reason I myself began to play and write. It may not be appealing to most, but to Beck, under the circumstances it was written, it was a soul clensing. I recommend this CD to fans of Beck (as I am a casual listener to his music) and to fans of music itself. The songs speak for themself.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Bad history and a bad movie all rolled into one.  I could be a little more forgiving of the poor history lesson if the film had been a little more entertaining.  If you want a great film that is historically accurate try God's and Generals.
0790730960|5.0|If you liked the first one then you'll love Michael Keaton's last performance as \\"BATMAN\\"! It might not be the last Batman movie but to all fans of Batman it sure seems like it. In the other Batman movies after this one you won't find the shadowed figure in the dark, you won't find Gotham to be such a gothic place, you won't hear the brilliant and original Batman theme, you won't find enemy's such as the ones in Keaton's movies, and most important Michael Keaton is Batman no one can replace him. This movie is the best Christmas movie out there. It doesn't have Santa Claws riding around in a big red sled, no it has Batman and it's not a sled it's the Batmobile (the coolest car out there). But Jokers not the villain in this one it's \\"THE PENGUIN\\"! He's a man that is deformed and into a chubby big nosed three fingered penguin. Who has nothing better to do then kill all the first born children of Gotham City. And to put it into a blockbuster hit \\"CATWOMAN\\" is also on his side.  The only one to stop them is... BAAA BA BA DAAA DAAA INNN \\"BATMAN\\"!
B00006LPER|5.0|I've seen Isabelle Huppert in three films now, and there's something about her looks, her expression, an inner stillness that goes right down to the base of her spine - something that lets you know she's a coiled spring all set to go sprooooiiiiing! This is one scary woman. The Piano Teacher takes this woman's sexual frustration and obsession to heights of perversity and cruelty that rise to the level of masterpiece. I can't say I 'enjoyed' watching this film, but I would give it the highest recommendation on every level because of the masterly performances of all involved. It's hard to watch, but once started, you'll find it impossible NOT to watch.<BR>Five stars.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|... but not nearly the mind-bogglingly original 5-star masterpiece people on the internet are making it out to be. <br />It amuses me to see how many people give this movie 5-stars.  Where, then, does that put the truly suspenseful and original films of people like Polanski, Kubrick, Hitchock, Murnau and other masters? <br />It also cracks me up to see how anybody who posts a negative review of Donnie Darko gets slammed with negative votes -- didn't Donnie's attitude about not following the pack influence anyone?  I'm prepared to take negative hits.  In fact, I'm going for the record, please help me reach it.<BR> <BR>This is a good idea for a movie with a great sense of atmosphere, but Donnie acts likes a jerk most of the time. Richard Kelly is an interesting director. If his follow-up to \\"Donnie\\" deserves half the accolades his debut won, it should be the greatest movie of the decade.
B000002UAO|5.0|It's well known that this is the seminal Beatles record, with this collection of songs they were starting to grow up, and they were ready to accept their role as the greatest Rock 'n' Roll band in the world.  Every Beatles album from here on in was a progression for Rock music, but this one is for the average listener, someone who has no interest in art or poetry and instead choses to focus on enjoyable lyrics and ear-friendly guitar riffs will love this album.<br />It starts with &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, a fun song that will always put a smile on the listeners face, and it only gets better.  &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is smart  and creative, one of Lennon's greatest creations.  Lennon and McCartney give us song after song of wonderful and heartfelt music, from the romantic &quot;Michelle&quot;, to the Dylan-inspired &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;, but George and Ringo definetely make themselves heard.  George's &quot;Think For Yourself&quot; is a great Electric tune, and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; is ahead of it's time and is an early sign of the great solo work George would eventually churm out.  Ringo's &quot;What Goes On&quot; stands out well amongst the others and is sure to get your feet tappin'.<br />No collection is complete without this, so do your ears a favor.
0142004235|4.0|If fiction reading is not your thing, if you are a non-fiction reader like myself, but want to get a flavor of what \\"East of Eden\\" is about, watch the original movie with James Dean as Cal.  If the book bores you, the movie will not. This movie came out 1954-55.  Dean's portrayal of Cal Trask is powerful and moving. I could identify with his feelings as a young person who desperately wants his father's love and approval, but is not the favorite child, and can never please his father. The role of the stern father is played by Raymond Massey.  The TV movie \\"East of Eden\\" with Jane Seymour was good too, and covers more of the book, but I prefer the original movie for obvious reasons (James Dean).
0140120416|5.0|The Russian language presents a lot of difficulties at the outset for beginners, even if you have already studied languages before. I first wanted to study Russian three years ago, and was constantly trying and giving up because of the endings and the verbal aspect, among other things. I had already gained a fair vocabulary, a fair mastery of noun endings, and an understanding of aspect. But when I bought this book, everything became very non-threatening. I easily learned a lot of small grammatical details, as well as ones that baffled me for years. All verbs are given in both aspect forms, and noun irregularities are shown. This did not discourage me, but rather made me want to lern the irregular stuff to enhance my correctness.<br />To all those fascinated with Russia and it's language, but cannot seem to get it right and are discouraged, fear not. This book will lift your spirits and show you that Russian is not that hard of a language afterall! I have also found studying Russian helpful in decoding the seemingly totally-irregular grammars of Polish and other Slavic languages. Knowing Russian will help you learn about ten more of these languages. Buy this book, grab a hold, and you'll soon be on friendly terms with Russian!
B00004SCX6|4.0|This should have been Britney Spears's first cd.<br />The songs are just so catchy and I love almost everyone of them.

0156027321|5.0|Beyond the seemingly &quot;far-out&quot; plot of this book, is a tender, sometimes terrifying tale of the human condition.  This is one of those rare books that makes you think while it entertains you.  Someone once told me a &quot;great book is one that you remember long after you read it.&quot;  This is one of those books.  The first half drags a bit -- but stay with it! You'll be glad you did.

038572179X|5.0|This powerful novel resonates with soft echoes (Cecilia's voice, Briony's play) and eerie reflections (Robbie twice leading two others to safety, separate images of a disembodied leg).  The characters are so finely drawn, I actually forgot I was reading fiction, instead felt myself hovering near real people struggling with credible moral dilemmas.  The ending is heart-rending but cathartic, and this is possibly the finest novel you'll ever read.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie was great!  It totally had me in tears esp. when David is abandoned by his &quot;mother&quot;.  I really felt for the robots in this movie, I know some people are mad because it puts humans in a bad light but I can see how humans could create something just to end up destorying it in the end.  To the ppl who have a problem following the story, it's simple.  A couple's son is frozen because he suffers from a disease, so the father brings home a robot boy (mecha) to replace him fearing that he may never wake up.  At first they have a hard time getting used to him esp. the mother, then with a change of heart she activates him into a &quot;real&quot; boy.  The family gets along great until Martin, the couple's  real son returns cured.  Martin, jealous of David tries to get him in trouble, until David is abandoned by the mother in the woods.  believing that if he becomes a real boy his mother will give him the love he has for her he sets off on a journey to find the blue fairy (from pinocchio, a book Martin wanted his mother to read to them suprise, suprise) in hopes that he will be made a real boy.  How can people be confused by this is beyond me!  The whole movie is based around his desire to become real and we see how mankind treats the Mechas, they have no freedom and are destoryed in front of a cheering public.  Are humans cabable of unconditional love towards machines even if we create them to give us that love?  Just listen to what Joe(Jude Law) says to David after visiting Dr. Know.  You have to see this movie, but if your expecting huge drawn out action scenes et al then don't even bother.  I recommend the Matrix for that.  Also someone asked how the future robots were made, simple they were made by other robots.
0385509456|5.0|I listened to the author be interviewed on NPR, and he was asked why he didn't label the main character (Christopher) as having high-functioning autism, or Asberger's syndrome. He said that he was very careful not to label Christopher, and that virtually all of the characteristics Christopher exhibits (not liking food to touch other food on his place, etc.) was behavior exhibited by some otherwise normal acquaintance of the author. The author also pointed out that a friend of his, who taught mathematics at the University level, said &quot;Christopher isn't a child with autism that likes math, he's a mathematician with some strange behavioral issues.&quot;<br />There's a hundred ways to look at Christopher, to pre-judge and categorize him, to dismiss him as a human being because of how you perceive him to be. The great triumph of this novel is that by the very style of his narration, Christopher brings you in to see the world on his terms rather than on your own. And the author accomplishes this without flourishes or tricks with mirrors--he does it with clean, concise straightforward writing and what appears to be a built-in understanding and empathy toward his main character.<br />This is one of those books that is worth reading simply because it gives you another view of the world, a view that, while most &quot;normal&quot; people can't imagine it, is nevertheless a perfectly rational and valid interpretation.  After I finished it, I kept going back to look for passages because I wanted to figure out how the author did all this good stuff--it's been a while since I've found myself doing that with a book.
B00000DCHI|1.0|The first CD in this set has something called Sony Music &quot;CD Extra&quot;.  This is a multimedia program that includes videos, etc.  It will also install AOL software on your PC.  In my case, it simply did not work.  I am unable to play the music from the first CD on my PC.  The second CD is normal and works fine.  I followed the instructions and went to the Sony website, and they do have a web page for &quot;CD Extra&quot;.  I sent an email to their customer support, and it came back undeliverable because there was no such address.  Looks like &quot;CD Extra&quot; bombed.  Find another title if you want to be able to list to Piano Man.
B00005JM09|3.0|Frankly, I am surprised by all of the 4s and 5s that were given.  I liked T1 and T2, and this one had an interesting plot, BUT the story line was about 15 minutes long and the action could/should have been condensed to 15 minutes, too.  Some of the effects were cool, but the fight scenes were way too drawn out. Even my husband, a Terminator fan club member, was disappointed.  Wait for the video. I still give it 3 because it has T1 and T2 (and T4?) to redeem it.

B00006LSM3|5.0|This CD starts out with a few catchy tunes.  \\"Any Road\\" has guitar parts that combine, Electric, Acoustic, Bass, Slide and Banjulele, combining with piano and drums, to play its own game:<br />Sometimes you're cool, sometimes you're lame,<br />Somewhere you pay your fare,<br />Bow to God and call him Sir,<br />And if you don't know where you're going<br />Any road will take you there.<br />I left out a few verses and lines, and the first time I heard it I was watching the video, so I couldn't help thinking that it was as good as anything used to be by the Traveling Wilburys, almost another \\"End of the Line\\" song, featuring George Harrison and Jeff Lynne doing Vocals and Backing Vocals with Dhani Harrison.<br />The second song, \\"P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night)\\" is also a catchy combo by the same people with Ukulele and Wurlitzer, for a much less serious sound.  Michelangelo in the first verse doesn't inspire much beyond \\"Claustrophobic and ex-Catholic Last Saturday night\\" in the second verse.  The high point, highly suspect for such a rollicking good time, is the middle verse:<br />It's quite suspicious to say the least<br />Even mentioned it to my local priest<br />One Our Father, three Hail Marys<br />Each Saturday night.<br />The song seems to repeat the \\"One Our Father three Hail Marys\\" line often enough to prepare listeners for George Harrison's shift to Eastern religion in the final song on the CD, \\"Brainwashed,\\" in which Shiva Shiva and Hare Hare are the main repetitions.<br />The song \\"Pisces Fish\\" adds a few more musicians for Additional Keyboards.  This music is more contemplative, and the rest of the album, too, though perhaps not as well.<br />The first verse and last two verses of \\"Looking for my Life\\" end with the chorus,<br />I never knew that things exploded<br />I only found it out when I was down upon my knees<br />Looking for my life.<br />The other verses are as glum, unless \\"Caught up on me with intensity, Had no idea where I was heading\\" is given an interpretation which is more mystical.  If you check the \\"Oh\\"s in the printed lyrics, there's \\"Oh Lord,\\" \\"Oh Love,\\" \\"Oh boy,\\" \\"Oh Lord,\\" \\"Oh boys,\\" and \\"Oh Lord.\\"<br />I could even make the song, \\"Rising Sun\\" sound sad.  The glorious part, for me, is based on the idea that the atoms of our bodies have been formed long ago in stars.  Taking the long view, you have the:<br />Universe at play inside your DNA<br />You're a billion years old today<br />Oh the rising sun . . .<br />\\"Marwa Blues\\" does not have any words, but it has George Harrison playing Slide Guitar, Keyboards and Finger Cymbals, and you can imagine what the other four people are doing, though this is the only song on the CD with Strings Arranged and Conducted by Marc Mann.  It has a peaceful, soothing quality, and it is easy to relax and just let them play it for whatever reason they have.<br />\\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" is a song on \\"Talking to myself, Crying out loud.\\"  The next song has enough pep that it might be more cheerful, but the main line is \\"There's no escape, can only run so far.\\"  Then \\"Never Get over You\\" actually uses the word, \\"Girl,\\" and could be romantic.<br />I knew when you arrived<br />That no words could describe<br />What your love made me do<br />I'll never get over you . . .<br />You warm the coldest feet<br />Can cool me in the heat<br />\\"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" was not written by George Harrison, and sounds more traditional than the other songs on this CD, with a tuba featured just before the last line.<br />\\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" is a shy woman Hawaiian blues song, with George Harrison on Dobro Slide, Ukulele, and the usual instruments and Backing Vocals.<br />The final song, \\"Brainwashed,\\" strives for the most significance.  The first chorus starts with:<br />God God God<br />A voice cries in the wilderness<br />The second chorus ends with:<br />God God God<br />Your nature is eternity<br />God God God<br />You are Existence, Knowledge, Bliss.<br />It iseasy to miss the list of things in the verses, which go by so fast.<br />Brainwashed in our childhood<br />Brainwashed by the schools<br />If there is a funny line in this song, it is \\"They even got my grandma when she was working for the mob.\\"  The song and CD end with Namah Parvarti performed by George and Dhani Harrison, which is another peaceful part of this album.  You might not understand that part, but it is not really boring.  They sound like they know what they are doing, and you could get into it after a while.easy to miss the list of things in the verses, which go by so fast.<br />Brainwashed in our childhood<br />Brainwashed by the schools<br />If there is a funny line in this song, it is \\"They even got my grandma when she was working for the mob.\\"  The song and CD end with Namah Parvarti performed by George and Dhani Harrison, which is another peaceful part of this album.

006092988X|5.0|\\"A tree grows in Brooklyn\\" follows the life of a young poor girl living near the ghettos of Brooklyn in a small apartment. She lives through many trials of being hard up on money, but family ties and events keep the apple of life as sweet as ever. Even sweeter, for though every meal is an adventure, she has a wonderful education and class, which as her mother believes is the difference between two types of richness, money and love from people and richness of knowledge. As she grows up, she sees the rest of the world, and her life is compared to a tree in Brooklyn, which always forces itself to grow, as she pushes her way out of poverty, getting a good job, and struggling to rise above her parents and go on for greater things. It is a very compassionate story, moves quickly, and though life is viewed from the point of a young girl growing into an elegant woman, it is meant for all ages. It gives the reader a power of hope. Aye, it has the same underlying generalized moral, but in such sweet and unique words, its like drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter day. This is an awesome book, which you should read at least once in any point of your life, for it touches on all aspects of life. Cheers!! : )

B0000797IO|4.0|With this film, Jennifer Aniston shows her fans than she can do more than the bubbly cute Rachel Greene from \\"Friends\\"---a role that has made her famous.  She did a nice turn in \\"The Object of My Affection\\" a few years back but she does better with Justine, a young woman living a miserable existence, suddenly tempted with decisions that will test her willingness to stay in the humdrum world she seems imprisoned in.  Her painter husband, played by John C. Reilly---the hardest working man in show biz, is a stoner.  Her job at the local Retail Rodeo discount store provides nothing interesting in her life until a young loner, named Holdeman is hired as a cashier(Jake Gyllenhal).  Justine, after becoming acquainted with him, begins an affair that will have her questioning which direction her life will be taking.  Will she take a wild ride with a young, unstable lover and leave her boring world behind or stay in the relationship that leaves her wanting more? Anniston does a good job in this role and proves that she deserves more movie roles.  The supporting players do well in their roles, as well, complimenting Aniston's performance.  This is a film that really makes you think about decisions you make in your life and how each choice can give you such different outcomes.  Worth seeing.
0385504209|1.0|I enjoyed the setup of this book but got tired of the whole cat and mouse thing and the subject matter of the book -- all about &quot;goddess worship&quot; which has been dealt with much better in other books such as The Red Tent and The Mists of Avalon. I did not like the way this goddess worship is portrayed as superior to Christianity. I was able to figure out several of the &quot;clues&quot; before the characters did and I saw the end twist coming. I barely even read the last few pages. A big disappointment because it had gotten so many great comments from so many people.
B00005JLSE|5.0|In movies, we see the prince carrying the princess away on a horse as they head toward the sunset... but. You never find out what happens to them after that! How do the authors now they will live happily ever after? This is a continuation of a fairy tale. Only it shows reality. It shows history of the Roaring '20's at their most exciting moment. This musical shows more than excitment, it shows reality, but adding music to it makes the audience have more of a comical impression of a serious situation. It also relaxes some people, because Roxie speaks to the bad girl/boy in all of us. This musical truly speaks for itself, and it helps us realize how much our decision affect us, and helps us learn how many people are affect as well. Beautiful musical, full of fun and comical suspence! I love it!!!!
B00000ADG2|5.0|In the mid-Nineties, The Fugees reigned supreme on the R'n'B scene. With their massive No.1 album \\"The Score\\" and a huge multi-million selling UK No.1 in the form of \\"Killing Me Softly,\\" the talent of Wyclef Jean shone very brightly. Beyond Wyclef's talent, however, there was one other. Another talent that stood head and shoulders above everyone else, a musical and lyrical talent not since the days of artists such Aretha Franklin and Joni Mitchell. It was of course, the raw talent of Lauryn Hill.<br /><br />Expectations were high for solo material from The Fugees members. The fall of 1998 brought Lauryn Hill's first solo record since her success with The Fugees. It was called \\"The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill.\\" The album stormed to No.1 and went 7x Platinum in the US, also topping the charts in many other foreign territories. A few were calling it hype, but the critics were gushing for Miss Hill. Read any review of this album by a professional critic and they are bound to call this album something along the lines of \\"A ground-breaking classic that totally re-writes the Hip Hop rule book.\\" Lauryn Hill deservedly earnt a record 10 Grammy nominations in 1999, and won five (Album Of The Year, Best New Artist, Best R&B album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, Best R&B Song).<br /><br />The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill is a classic record, which is up there with albums by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye as one of the most influential and ground-breaking records in its category. The album is unique in its style - it encompasses many styles and captures many influences from sin, love, depression, street life, fame, wealth, the past, the present and the future. The first song, \\"Lost Ones,\\" is quick to dispel the stereotypes of Hip Hop culture by taking on a different subject than most other rappers albums. Lauryn sings about the way people change, and how it's not always for the better. The hit single \\"Ex-Factor\\" shows a very emotional side of Lauryn. She sings of a lover who she is with, but their relationship is so difficult because of his dependency on her.<br /><br />\\"To Zion\\" speaks a real truth about Lauryn's turbulent past. Martial drums and a beautiful chant towards the end makes this song totally epic. \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\" is the lead single from the album. Lauryn's rapping is at her best on here. Everything fits together so well - lyrics, beats, arrangement. It's all excellent, and it's extremely thought-provoking. The rather dreary \\"Superstar\\" sees Lauryn angrily attack all the rappers who are only concerned with the money, the girls and the bling-bling. It is followed-up by the wonderful \\"Final Hour.\\" Lauryn's rapping in this song is on top-form, and my favourite part is where she sings, \\"Now I'm-a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller, still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella, whether posed in Maribella, in couture, or collectin' residuals from off The Score.\\" It's amazing. The way she sings it, the tone in her voice, the emotion and the catchiness of it all - it really does touch the depths of your soul.<br /><br />\\"When It Hurts So Bad\\" is an excellent song about confused love, while \\"I Used To Love Him\\" is a fantastic duet with Mary J. Blige in which the two sing about a guy they once loved, but don't anymore. Plain and simple. \\"Forgive Them Father\\" is a song about the sinners who use people and then talk them down. A thought-provoking song to those who take people for granted. \\"Every Ghetto, Every City,\\" is a brilliant and funky R&B song in which Lauryn reminisces about her childhood past, and how she remembers everything. \\"Nothing Even Matters\\" is a duet with D'Angelo, and a beautiful ballad. You can just sit back and relax to this wonderful song.<br /><br />\\"Everything Is Everything\\" is definitely an album highlight. Striking beats and wonderful vocals are joined with amazing lyrics with references to the bible, Egyptian past, European culture and much more. It's a very interestingtopic on life and how you chose to live it. The album's title track, \\"The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\\" has a brilliant piano, and Lauryn's vocals are stunning. This song is a complete revelation and a perfect 'official' closing song. Bonus tracks include a cover of \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\" and \\"Tell Him.\\" Both fantastic songs, which should've been included on every version of this superb album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />In between many of the songs on \\"The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill,\\" we get to listen to a high school lesson in which Lauryn should be present at, but isn't. They talk mostly about love and people - how to treat them, and the way people live. Lauryn is obviously not present for the lessons, so she offers us her 'Miseducation' through her songs. Her songs are her 'Miseducation,' and she educates the listener on her experiences. When listening to the songs, you realise that Lauryn didn't even need to be present at the lessons - she's done fine on her own, and she is a total genius.

0385504209|4.0|I really wanted to give this book a five star rating, but was  slightly disappointed with the ending.  Not the ending I would have chosen, but then again I am not writing the book.  Very good read. Chapters set-up for moving along at a fast pace.  Characters were very good and interesting.  I have 18 years of Catholic School education and did not find any of the subject matter disturbing.  This is a work of fiction, the author has the right to make whatever conclusions he wants.  The societies described in the book do exist.  Every society has deviant<br />characters and monsters, this does not make an entire society bad. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Indiana Jones, touch of the Fugitive (innocent man seemed to be framed)and the Omen.  This book did make me wonder about the societies talked about.  Went on Yahoo and did some research, very interesting.  Good read for the summer.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Rather than repeat what about 10 reviews that I glanced at wrote, I am going to talk about the songs on this album.  It seems some people are obsessed with comparing 'Thief' to every other Radiohead album and say that it's not as good, or rank them in order, or say Radiohead will never make something the same again, but I've got some news:  Nobody cares!  Nobody wants to hear you talk about other albums, they want to know about the album you claim to be reviewing.  Besides, if you asked me when bands stopped really creating original music I'd say it hasn't happened since Wish You Were Here in 1975, so boo-hoo.  <br />     Here is why I think 'Thief' deserves 5 stars, and a few things other reviewers have missed in their shallow perusal of this sonic masterpiece (watch and be amazed as I don't refer to any other Radiohead albums).  First, this is the closest Radiohead have come to reproducing their live sound on a studio recording.  Thom Yorke has cut loose like never before on tracks such as '2 + 2 = 5' (which blows me away because of not only its beat and insane guitar riffs but also its very complex 7/8 time signature), 'Backdrifts,' and 'There There.'  Another often-missed quality of this album is the resurgence of the piano (not Fender Rhodes electric piano) as a staple of the music.  Listen for it, and you'll realize that Radiohead has never used the instrument as much as they do in this album, and surprisingly, from this electronica-driven band, it works.  From electronic on 'Sit Down. Stand Up.' to melodic on 'Sail to the moon' to creepy then rockin' on 'We Suck Young Blood' to funky on 'Punchup At A Wedding,' the piano is a hidden treasure which is used to its full variety and potential.  <br />      I am again taken by Jonny Greenwood's deliciously loud yet still talented guitar licks (listen to the computer-like feedback at the end of 'Go To Sleep') and Colin Greenwood's use of the bass as a lead instrument ('Myxomatosis').  Thom's vocal arrangements are mind-blowing on 'I will,' 'We suck young blood' and 'There There,' to name a few (listen to them and try to pick out how many vocal tracks there are, then sit back and enjoy the harmony and dynamics of each individual vocal part he's singing--it amazes me).  Thom's lyrics have changed as well--what used to be enigmatic puzzles are now more accessible yet still meaningful rantings.  <br />Last, I'd like to touch on the final track, 'A Wolf at the Door.'  What starts out sounding like some sort of Lucy in the Sky psychedelic ballad goes somewhere I never thought I'd hear Radiohead travel.  Thom talks/raps the verse lyrics (which are a gloriously paranoid stream of consciousness) in the style reminiscent of Bob Dylan's talking blues on 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' then cuts to a beautifully melodic chorus.  This hits me out of nowhere, and I love it!  These are a few high points of Hail To the Thief (which by the way isn't about the 2000 US election [come on, these guys are British anyway], but is a phrase the band read describing a political upset in the 1800's [read interviews, not reviews for the REAL information]).  If, after reading this, you can't find something different to like and appreciate about this album, you're not listening close enough!
B000084T18|1.0|this album is an absolute disgrace to hip-hop.  there is no decent song on this cd that hasnt been heard on the radio (which i dont like anyway), i only got this because my mate almost forced me to, saying it was so good.  the next day i beat him up.  i strongly recommend to everyone not to buy this, you will be disappointed like i am.  it seems there are no decent hip-hop albums coming out these days, except for the recent Too $hort album.  if you want real rap from THE pimp, get any TOO $HORT album, not this fricken impostor, 50 cent.  every too $hort album is better than this (and he has 14 albums), which says something.  SHORTY THE PIMP!  50 cent is just a wanna-be too $hort/pimp.  DONT GET IT...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
B00008NRLX|5.0|It's been a long time since I heard a song on the radio that made me want to rush out and buy the CD. Then, on an alt-rock station in Northern California, I heard the Jayhawks' &quot;Save It For a Rainy Day,&quot; and said to myself, &quot;I must have this!&quot; I bought the CD, and although &quot;Save It For a Rainy Day&quot; is still my favorite song on it, I was delighted to hear that the rest of the CD was of the same quality. The jangly, country-tinged guitars and lovely melodies make this CD compulsive listening, as does Gary Louris' pure, sweet troubadour's voice. A must for anyone who likes rock music the way they used to make it!
B000002H97|3.0|I waited almost three years for this album to come out. I waited drooling and dreaming of what could they do to make a better album than ...And Justice. The day came. I bought Black and raced out to my car jammed it in the CD player and cried. My favorite band was gone and they put imposters in thier place. Outside of four songs this album is a debacle. In short Bob Rock ruined the best heavy metal band ever. Other reviewers said the lyrics are better on Black than ...And Justice. They clearly haven't listened to Justice. ...And Justice is complex and wicked music inwhich the lyrics are carefully intwined. I'm still waiting for Metallica to make a better album than ..And Justice. St. Anger is a step in the right direction.
B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden's \\"Somewhere In Time\\", is their first recording to feature the extensive use of synthesized guitars, marking a significant point in the evolution of Maiden's signature sound.  While the \\"softer\\" synthesized sound does not have the hard edge found on their earlier recordings, the band was still capable of producing music with a punch.  Guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray were experimenting with new equipment and sounds, producing music that vocalist Bruce Dickinson once characterized as \\"cosmic jazz\\".  While Maiden's music may never quite fall into the jazz category, there was no doubt that the band was taking their music in a new direction.  The sound could perhaps be described as \\"spacey\\".  In the new aural environment, Steve Harris's bass may not seem as edgy as on previous albums, and to a certain extent, Nicko McBrain's drums are also absorbed in the mix.  Murray's trebly solo sound also does not stand out as much, and it is heard less, as Adrian Smith asserts himself.<br />Reflecting a change in the band's attitude, the lyrics do not delve deeply into evil and the dark side.  The music might even be called optimistic, especially following the somewhat dark tone of \\"Powerslave\\".  Produced once again by Martin Birch, there are some great songs on this album, beginning with \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\", a masterpiece that features creative songwriting, signature changes, soaring solos, energetic drumming, and some menacing vocals.<br />Adrian Smith's \\"Wasted Years\\", is the closest thing to a single, and its retrospective theme, alludes to the maturity of the band members.  The song structure, like most of the songs on the album, is a departure from their previous efforts.  The solo is all Adrian, and it flows smoothly like a fine wine.<br />\\"Deja Vu\\" is the album's most energetic tune, and rocks from start to finish.  The inspired interplay and harmony section in the solo break is very compelling, and may be what \\"cosmic jazz\\" is all about.<br />Harris's \\"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" builds in layers, and then approaches the classic \\"galloping\\" Maiden sound.  More tasty, spacey guitar, and silky smooth harmony passages.<br />Smith's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", based on the adventures of an arctic traveler, is an extremely cool sounding tune, with a steady pulsing bass line.  Adrian steps up again, and delivers a powerful, tension filled solo.<br />The thought provoking \\"Heaven Can Wait\\", further shows the band's maturity with an interesting look at near death experience.  Murray has the first solo, and Smith the second.  In between is a sing along section that makes this song a concert favorite.<br />\\"Sea of Madness\\" may be the most ambiguous song lyrically.  Yet it has almost a cheerful tone while delivering a message of despair.  Like other songs on this album written by Smith, this one features just his guitar solo.<br />It seems that no Maiden release is complete without a Steve Harris epic as the finale, and so we have \\"Alexander the Great\\", a song that despite it's length is still very tight musically.  Dickinson does a good job with some tricky lyrics, and there is more tasteful \\"cosmic\\" guitar work by Murray and Smith.<br />Iron Maiden's experimentation with this particular sound would continue on their next album, \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\".  How much regard fans have for these particular releases is an interesting question.  They do however, mark a significant phase in the evolution of the band.  \\"Somewhere In Time\\" is among the band's most progressive and enjoyable releases.is's \\"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" builds in layers, and then approaches the classic \\"galloping\\" Maiden sound.

Martel entertains his audience by being Pi from every level of his life, from a small boy in an Indian Zoo, a teen surviving all odds on a life boat with a Tiger, named Richard Parker, to an adult man living his life in Canada.  When Pi \\"discovers\\" Richard Parker on the life boat this proves to be the crucial moment of self preservation.  This book is more than a beach read because of the opportunity it gives the reader to decide what the truth really is.  I wish I could meet Pi Patel and thank him for leading such an exciting life.
B000099T2L|3.0|I thought this album will be more of a dancy, fast beat album.. only to find out it's definitely different from what I was expecting.<br /><br />From the moment I heard \\"Crazy in Love\\" on the radio it immediately came to my mind that \\"Hey.. that song sounds good, and it's upbeat and catchy. I'm sure the entire album is fast and dancy-ish, too.\\"<br /><br />I'm very, very disappointed.
1576751988|5.0|'Eat That Frog', by Brian Tracy, is an excellent book on ceasing procrastination and on time management. While I'm not personally a procrastinator, and this problem seems to have a straightforward solution (it does -- 'stop worrying about it and just do it'), many otherwise intelligent people are plagued with this problem to some degree. In this short (113 pages in hardback), easy-to-read book, Mr. Tracy urges his readers to tackle the least-desirable, hardest task first, rather than putting it off in favor of completing easy, less important tasks. (That what the title refers to -- if one has to eat an ugly frog, he should do it immediately, so that he doesn't spend all day worrying about it.) He then goes through the typical time management strategies of Pareto and quad-based prioritization, division of large tasks into smaller component tasks, etc.<br />Fortunately, since it's short and easy-to-read (should take maybe an hour or so), even the worst procrastinator will probably get around to reading it.

B00005T33W|5.0|Ghost World is an intelligent, original and funny look at modern life from the perspective of outsiders who don't fit in very well and don't really want to. Director Terry Zwigoff also made the documentary Crumb, which was about offbeat cartoonist Robert Crumb and his oddball family. Apparently Zwigoff has a good understanding and sympathy for people living on the cultural fringes. Ghost World is itself based on a comic book, though I am not familiar with it. Ghost World follows the adventures of recent high school graduates Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson). Actually, Enid hasn't quite graduated; she must take a summer school course first. Enid is a witty misanthrope who despises the normal people and soulless suburbia that surrounds her. Her acerbic commentaries are a large part of the movie's wit. Enid and Rebecca play a rather sadistic practical joke on an older man named Seymour (played to perfection by Steve Buscemi). Enid soon regrets this and finds that she likes and is attracted to him. Seymour is intelligent and sensitive but something of a social misfit. He collects old records and, like Enid, feels ill at ease in the world. This new friendship creates a wedge between Enid and the basically more conventional Rebecca, who sees Seymour as merely a nerd. Ghost World is a film that relies far more on characterization and social commentary than on plot development. Apart from the nuanced performances by Birch and Buscemi, the film effectively portrays the barrenness of modern suburban America. I don't know where it was filmed, but it could have been, alas, almost anywhere. There are also some very good supporting roles, such as Illeana Douglas as Enid's art teacher. Her role, though secondary, is typical of the of the film's sublety. At first she seems comically naive, flaky and PC, but she ends up being supportive of Enid when a controversy over a racially sensitive art work arises. Similarly, Buscemi's character at first seems like a stereotype nerd, but is gradually fleshed out. Ghost World shows the world from a perspective too seldom seen in modern cinema. Most outsiders in modern movies are hit men, drug dealers or below normal in some way (retarded, autistic, etc.). Enid and Seymour, by contrast, are alienated by their perceptiveness and sensitivity. They are perhaps overly judgmental and reactionary, but they don't simply consume, conform and passively absorb the world around them. They question everything and find much ugliness, stupidity and imperfection. Ghost World has a fairly dim and cynical view of the world, but in many ways it is right on target.ype nerd, but is gradually fleshed out.

B00004WG2X|5.0|I have watched the newer A&E adaptation of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" (starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth) a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it very much. Last week, I borrowed from the local British Council Library, the video of this much earlier (1980) adaptation of Austen's novel. And my verdict? I find this earlier production to be MUCH, MUCH superior to A&E's!!    The casting is perfect, principally Elizabeth Garvie (an Elizabeth playing \\"Elizabeth Bennett\\", how very nice!), David Rintoul (as Mr Darcy) and the actors playing Mr & Mrs Bennett (brilliant performance from both), Mr Collins, Charlotte Lucas and oh, just about EACH and EVERY character! I must give my opinion that I find the Mr Darcy here far handsomer than that portrayed by Colin Firth. David Rintoul's Darcy is classically handsome - tall, dark, brooding, with nicely chiselled features and a very noble bearing. I loved to hear him speak. Elizabeth here is reasonably pretty too, has a ready wit and also displays great sensibility and generosity (I thought Jennifer Ehle was a little chubby for her character). The Mr Collins in this earlier production is also truer to the book; he is still odious, self-centred and annoying to the last degree, but is less of a caricature than that portrayed in A&E's version.    But I enjoyed this production best of all for the following 3 reasons:    1) I like it that some of Elizabeth's most important thoughts are made known to the viewer through a voice-over. For instance, after rejecting Darcy's proposal, we find Elizabeth, not in tears like in the A&E's version, but thoughtful and a little dazed, and as she sits down to \\"digest\\" what has just happened, the voice-over lets us know what she is thinking. At the end of her thoughts, when she smiles and concludes that she finds Darcy's proposal, \\"gratifying\\", I find it plausible. Who in Elizabeth's position wouldn't find Darcy's proposal flattering?    2) Although made in 1980, this production does not look at all \\"jaded\\"or 1980s (unlike many earlier BBC dramas). The costumes are beautiful (with many costume changes for the main characters) and the make-up does not give the impression that this is an outdated production. The characters too do not look like they are wearing wigs. I only wish it will be made available on DVD soon with perhaps the colour and picture quality improved.    3) The ending here is more pleasing and romantic than A&E's. The words uttered by our hero and heroine in the end are sweet and romantic and will stay in the viewer's mind for a long time.    If you have enjoyed A&E's adaptation, then I urge you to pick up this earlier video and see for yourself why the latter is the better and more enjoyable production. I also notice that the newer adaptation actually took a lot of \\"ideas\\" from this earlier production.    To me, this video was 259 minutes of pure viewing pleasure!

B00008X5J1|5.0|An epic on the scale of \\"Gangs of New York\\" only comes once in a blue moon. The film's scope is so great that Scorcese's literally and figuratively utilized the proverbial \\"cast of thousands\\". Mammoth sets and period costuming accentuate the story of a young man seeking revenge against the man that slew his father many years earlier. A secondary element of the plot is its tale of a country in transition. The emergence of the \\"gangs\\" in New York is a reflection of the various ethnic groups that made up much of the immigrant populations and the clashes of such strong Old World cultures. The corrupt city officials that ran New York at the time are also part of this riveting story.<br />Daniel Day Lewis's \\"Bill the Butcher\\" is the kind of reprehensible character that audiences love to hate. Lewis embodies the character's warped sense of patriotism with a swagger of bravado that is magnified on the big screen. When given the right role, DiCaprio shows his mettle as an actor. \\"Gangs\\" gives him that in the part of \\"Amsterdam Vallon\\", a young man seeking vengeance as well as respect for his people. Cameron Diaz's \\"Jenny Everdeane\\" is miles away from anything that the actress has done before or since. Henry Thomas is also impressive as DiCaprio's friend and betrayer.<br />One of the great mysteries is why this film did not sweep the 2003 Academy Awards. It should have for all parties concerned.<br />But, the world, especially the Oscar-voting contingency, is not a fair place.

B00006GEXR|5.0|While there is a certain modicum of truth that Hugh Grant seems to play the same personality over and over, i.e. being the Cary Grant of this generation, in this particular movie, he shines out in what's possibly his best role to date since Four Weddings And A Funeral.  This isn't solely to his performance of being a self-sufficient selfish loner who can't relate to people who have jobs or families, but the way in which his onscreen narration describes his point-of-view, his philosophy, makes Will an interesting character:  &quot;Me, I didn't mean anything about anything to anyone, and I knew that guaranteed me a long, depression-free life.&quot;<br />Will is proud to be an island, particularly the holiday resort Ibiza.  He describes his life as a TV show.  As head of the Will Show, which isn't an ensemble drama, &quot;people come and go, but it comes down to [him] alone.&quot;<br />Will tries picking up women at a single parents support group, SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), and falls for Suzie.  After his mother suffers a depressive spell, Marcus later realizes he needs a backup, and turns to Will, with whom he spends time with after school, thus drastically changing the format of the Will Show.  Without going into too much detail, something drastic happens to the star of the Will Show as well--he becomes more human, more connected, gains a soul, etc.<br />The one good thing I'm noticing about certain movies is that they bring out the pains of being a kid who doesn't fit in, gets picked on, and tries to but due to external forces, can't.  In Marcus's case, his mother stands out as a &quot;granola basket case&quot; as Will describes her, she is vegetarian, and is unaware of the need for kids to fit into their peer group via pop culture.  Even his sudden singing out in class might've been &quot;cool&quot; among his peers if it had been something like the Mystikal CD Will gives him for Christmas.  Instead, he is jeered at for singing the Carpenters' &quot;Rainy Days And Mondays&quot; in class.<br />Much of the other supporting actors really bring this movie to life, especially Nicholas Hoult as Marcus and Rachel Weisz as Rachel, a women Will falls for later on.  And Badly Drawn Boy's soft alternative sounds enhance this movie.  In the end, the point is regardless of the kind of life one leads, be it living off royalties, being a single parent, etc., it's whether one has the appropriate backup.  One doesn't have to join the mainland (mainstream) per se, but as a compromise, be part of an archipelago (distinct lifestyles).<br />There's another subtle message that I might be reading too much into.  Will says he's proud he's an island, but it's a &quot;sad fact from time to time, I had to visit the mainland.&quot;  I wonder if this is a hidden punch at the UK's isolated geographic position as opposed to the continent, Europe, or even its position over the Euro.  And what about the title?  While About A Boy could well refer to Marcus, who becomes the catalyst in Will's life, it could also be about Will himself, who in his sense of being a blank, might as well be one as well.Days And Mondays&quot; in class.<br />Much of the other supporting actors really bring this movie to life, especially Nicholas Hoult as Marcus and Rachel Weisz as Rachel, a women Will falls for later on.

B00004WGAI|5.0|Jane Eyre is without question my all time favourite book.  I first read it in high school and I vivdly recall the hairs standing up on the back of my neck the first time Jane heard \\"Grace Pool\\"'s insane laughter in the night!  This is the most faithful film version I've yet to see.  OK, Timothy Dalton is too handsome to play Rochester, but he has the character nailed to a tee - passionate, tortured, sardonic with just the right level of bitterness at the way \\"fortune has knocked me about\\".  And Zelah Clark is the best Jane I've come across.  Quiet, understated, but she's no shrinking violet and does not hesitate to stand up to the brooding, unpredictable and intimidating Edward Fairfax Rochester.  And the wonderful dialog comes almost directly from the book.  I think the reason this is the best is because it was a mini-series and could accommodate the entire story (for the same reason the Firth/Ehle version of Pride & Prejudice is the best version of that story).  A two hour movie cannot do either story justice.<br />I absolutely abhored the Zefferelli version - who in their right mind would cast William Hurt as Rochester????  And Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane was a bit pouty and petulant.  Plus, some scenes were combined or compressed to fit the time requirements distorting the story.  For many of the same reasons, I didn't care for the A&E version, though Samantha Morton was a pretty good Jane.  But the usually wonderful Ciaran Hinds (see him in Austen's Persuasion) portayed Edward as so overly bitter (bordering on pathetic) that I couldn't see why anyone would fall in love with him.  I don't think that I've ever seen the George C Scott/Trish Van Devere version.  And it's been eons since I've seen the Joan Fontaine/Orson Wells version, but if memory serves, the casting was good, but again, the story was compressed for time and the dialog was subpar.  There are just some lines of dialog that simply MUST be included for me to enjoy any version of this story and if those lines are not there it's curtains!<br />If you are a fan of Jane Eyre, you might want to read a book called Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys.  It's a prequel and tells a version of the story of Edward's time in Jamaica and his marriage to his first wife (a rather strange story focusing on voodoo, slave unrest and her mother's mental instability).  It's also been made into a movie (circa 1998?) which was okay.
B00005JLT5|2.0|the script is too simple and the story is just too common. if the so-called pianist could be picked as a worthwhile mentioning character, then everyboty like you and me could be picked as a person whose stories need to be told. this is just another 2nd world war survivor story, plain and simple albeit bored. the whole movie, to me, is just a guy who's trying very hard to hide from the nazis and throughout the whole movie, he's just trying to get some food to eat on a day to day basis. he's not a great person, or a person with great personality. the guy who got the oscar didn't seem to be entitled getting one, since after i've watched jack nicholson's and nicholas cage's oscar competing movies, adrien brody is simply not on the same altitude yet. well, on the other hand, it's just like watching a grey hound dogs race, the winner usually is not your first pick. by saying that, it only reminds me two other terribly made and acted movies, \\"lif is beautiful\\" and \\"my big fat greek wedding\\", simply by thinking about why they would be turned out to be the front runners is beyond my comprehension.
0380778556|5.0|Suspense, mystery, intrigue and one of the most fantastic twists in the tale. Reading through the narrators guilt and past everyones reverence of Rebecca a new branch is extended, and Rebecca's true colours are finally known. The part where Maxim tells his wife about Rebecca is spine-chilling-- not in a sense of the supernatural or blood and gore, but in a true psychological thriller sense (though that genre falls short of describing the thickly woven ruses in this novel). Classical.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Why I went and bought this on a whim is beyond me, but Jesus am I glad I bought it! <br />This is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  And it's the only \\"best album\\" I've thought that a fair enough portion was weak, the tracks in this case are the highly agitating \\"Golden Years\\" and \\"Wild Is The Wind,\\" which is a crooner-type ballad which is sung well but is not my cup of tea.  <br />The title track \\"Station To Station\\" is just one of the ultimate rock epics ever, right up there with Yes's \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" and Elton John's \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding.\\"  \\"Station To Station\\", on a structural level, is just perfect.  It takes just the right amount of time to build up the intensity, from the dark and ominous opening salvos to the introduction of the Thin White Duke to the rediculously joyous final 5 minutes of the track.   And I mean REDICULOUSLY joyous.  Be careful, you will destroy your stereo with this song, it's one of the best I've ever heard!<br />He could have filled the rest of the album up with complete junk and I would still give it a five star rating just for that track alone.  But then he delivers big time on the joyously seasick \\"TVC15\\" and the deep funk of \\"Stay.\\"  The latter track just totally jams the main theme for the last two minutes and you wish this could go on for 10 minutes like the title track.  <br />You could tell he was doing a bit of padding to fill up space (it was a rushed transistion album) but that \\"padding\\" only helped.  Ever feel like you have to play a song 5 million times because something about one listen just doesnt satisfy you?  These songs are totally the opposite.  One listen will leave you breathless.  I've been consistantly playing this disc 1-3 times a week for the last two months and I still love hearing it as much as the first time I heard it.  Keep in mind, that I really only listen to the three songs I mentioned!  Word On A Wing is actually a really good song but is dwarfed so much by the other songs that I just never listen to it.  And hell, I seem to be in the minority of people who think Golden Years is kind of lame so there's another slice of funk for you to relish.<br />You're a blasted fool if you don't buy this album.  If you like music, you'll like it.
B000089RVX|3.0|&quot;Fallen&quot; is a little different to the majority of nu-metal out there, with a slight gothic edge and the singer has a good voice...<br />BUT!<br />Australian band george has the lead singer Katie Noonan who has a similar, yet infinately superior voice. That, and george makes intelligent, interesting music with real emotion. I find &quot;Fallen&quot; has just one too many nu-metal cliches for me.<br />Bottom line: go and get george's album &quot;polyserena&quot;. You won't regret it!
0385504209|5.0|There is nothing better than a good novel - especially a mystery - that teaches you things.  Hardly a page was turned where I did not learn something.  One of the biggest mysteries about this book is where does the non-fiction end and the fiction begin.<br />This is a wonderful mystery centered around the old faithful hunt for the holy grail.  But this takes the grail to several new levels - what it is, who is keeping(?) it and what it means in history and especially to the Christian church.<br />The plot twists and turns just as any reader of the mystery gendre would like.  But there were several things that made the twists and turn special.  Good guys turned into bad guys and visa versa and seemingly tangential characters end up playing major roles.  The reader can also work on solving the main question - where is the grail? - since he gets the facts the same time as the main characters (what he does not get is all the background maneuverings).  Also some of the clues I was actually able to get before the main characters.  Lastly, this is the kind of mystery that I particularly enjoy - although one of the characters is a professor so he knows an inordinate amount about the subject matter - the main characters are regular humans with no superhuman qualities.  Everything they do is believable.<br />This book held me in its grasp tighter than any I have read in a long time - it is the kind of book you wish you could just sit and read without interruption.
0783230370|4.0|This is personally one of my favorite Arnie movies. It is funny, Arnie does a great acting job and it is very powerful in its message of the sanctity of life. I remember many scenes from this movie and really enjoyed the progression of Arnie's pregnancy both physically and emotionally. All cast members do a great job.<br /> I highly recommend this movie. Even though its been several years since i have seen it i can recall so many scenes. I especially remember the scene when Arnie decides to continue the pregnancy after learning he was pregnant-very subtle but powerful.Check it out--- you'll be back
1881273156|5.0|I can't speak of the emotion that fills my heart when thinking of this book. It is saving my marriage! My husband and I now know how to satisfy each other in the most basic of ways...I haven't felt so loved in my entire life! This book should be a MUST for every married/dating couple in the world! Actually, I think maybe it should be handed out at birth! LOL<BR>I also have &quot;The Five Love Languages of Children&quot;, and it is just as worthy and I think this one should be handed out to every parent at the arrival of their new baby.<BR>I have shared both books with many people, married/dating/parents alike, and hope that you choose it too! Oh, and don't worry if your mate doesn't want to read it...s/he will soon change their thinking once they start feeling their &quot;love tank&quot; filling up! And they will want to do the same for you! Guaranteed!
0783231202|4.0|I just recently got a chance to see this on TV, as I missed it back during it's release. As always Spielberg's methods draw you into the picture and capture you for the entire length of the movie. &quot;Amistad&quot; is a great historical Drama based on a true story about a ship load of African slaves that had mutineed against their spanish captors and landed on the shores of America, and the ensuing legal battle deciding thier fate (do they go back to the spainish government? the slave traders? or do they go free?).<br />With such an interesting tale to tell, and such excellent implimentation, it's hard not to like this movie. Spielberg had many obviously inspired moments in this film, showcasing the relationship of the slaves and their lawyer and the struggle to understand one another and flashbacks of the brutality the slaves had endured at the hands of their captors. The movie has many memorable moments that will stay with you and many parts that make interesting statements about human nature. One such interesting scene has the africans looking through a bible that was given to them, and they try to make sense of it, even though they know no english, by the pictures alone. One really gets the sense of what it must be like to be among and at the mercy of a strange and foreign culture.<br />A wonderful film.
B000069AUI|4.0|I would definately buy Coldplay's previous release, Parachutes, before I bought this CD.  This album is good, but doesn't have the same melancholy feel that I liked so much in the first album.
0767824571|5.0|If you have not seen this film, seriously, you've been deprived.  Monty Python was going strong in the late 60s/early 70s and after the show ended, the team decided to embark on a film project which led to &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot;  Released in 1975, this film has stood the test of time and produced many fans around the world and developed cult status.  Monty Python followed up with two sequels (&quot;Life of Brian,&quot; &quot;Meaning of Life&quot;), but of the three this comedy marvel is still the strongest.<br />Even when it drags a bit in the middle, this is still a collection of funny moments.  Who can forget the Black Knight scene with its overexaggerated blood spilling and silly determination of the black knight?  How about the knights who say ni?  The bridge of death?  These scenes and more are outstandingly hilarious and are scenes that one CANNOT dispute the fact that they are indeed funny.<br />The Monty Python Gang put fine performances into the various different roles that they play in addition to the main characters.  The biggest standout for me was Graham Chapman as King Arthur, probably due to his commanding presence.<br />The film, directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones of the Python gang, is noticeably low budget, but you can tell they satired that with silly animation transitions and use of coconuts and political satire.  One of the few films with a low budget that is intentionally looking low budgeted.<br />If you have not seen this film, YOU MUST.  It's a comedy gem and a classic.  Look past the hype, the conventions, etc. and enjoy the film.  It's still a 5-star classic that shouldn't be ignored.  Nooooow!  GO!
0060955775|5.0|This book transcends the boundaries of a mere story or modern day fable -  it is a touching yet chilling look at what happens when people suddenly start doing only what they want to do.  Set in a mental institution in Slovenia, the main character, Veronika, discovers after a botched suicide attempt that she may have been more successful than she thought; she won't live out the week.  Suddenly confronted with the limits of her own mortality in a place where people go to seek asylum from the outer world, she transforms herself and people around her into modern-day heroes brave enough to seek out their dreams.  Paolo Coelho's glimpse inside the reality of mental institutions questions the morality of the label 'crazy', exhorting us to sieze the day because one day it will be our last.  A truly outstanding book.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Beauty and the Beast is an excellent movie, a Disney classic and one of my all time favorites. So why did they have to add a scene?? The DVD version is weakened by the added scene in which the houseware characters sing, \\"Human Again.\\" The problem with this scene begins with the fact that it is not needed, add to that the color in the animation is different from that of the rest of the film and it just seems so completely out of place. To me the added scene seems uncomfortable. The bottom line is that it is a great movie, but the added scene brings it from a 5 to a 3 star rating!!!
0790737345|1.0|This is the most horrible remake I have ever found.  I assumed the English version could be close to the German version of Wings of Desire and was completely wrong.  This movie is the worst waste of film I have ever found!  The whole trench coat angel thing that was so critical to Wings of Desire made no sense in sunny hot Los Angeles.  The characters were massacred to fit into Los Angeles but none of the obvious things that would not fit in Los Angeles were touched.  This movie is way too much Hollywood with over exaggerated romance and of course death at the end.  I nearly died too.  It was sappy as Hell and even as a girl, too much for me.  It was too typical Hollywood with exaggerated romance, a stupid sex scene and death.  Wim Wenders is not Hollywood and thank God for it.  The cast of Wings of Desire took so much care with every element of the film.  The City of Angels cast just shot out their lines in a brainless manner without though of the big picture.  Maybe a complete redo of the whole Wings of Desire concept could have saved this movie.  Changing some parts and keeping others made for a horrible boring and annoying combination.  One star is being generous!
B00006V9A0|5.0|A Nirvana fan has all of this music. That's not the point of this album. A Nirvana fan has all the albums, making a Greatest Hits collection little more than fodder to complete a collection.<br />This album is different for one song and one song only.  It is different because of \\"You Know You're Right.\\"  Reading Rolling Stone during the time before this album was released and Courtney Love, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic were still debating the amount of music to release, Love and the members of Nirvana agreed that this was one of the best songs Curt Kobain wrote.<br />Funny enough, for once, hype was right. \\"You Know You're Right\\" is everything that great rock music is meant to be.  It is loud, it is soft, it is intellectual and it is emotional.  Cobain released his demons into this song, the last he'd ever record and it shows.  It was the best song of 2002, eight full years after he died.  If you listen close enough, you can begin to see through his eyes and see his life at that moment.  It is the most powerful piece of art to see the light of day in a long, long time.<br />The rest of the album is a best-of collection and it is a fairly accurate collection of the best of Nirvana. The acoustic sublimeness of \\"All Apologies\\" and \\"The Man who Sold the World\\" cap the album with a delicate touch, one rarely seen in a band whose music was fueled by depression and anger.<br />The key songs from In Utero and Nevermind are well documented, \\"Rape Me,\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" \\"Come as You Are,\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\"<br />And a few special moments from the early sessions are also there, \\"About a Girl\\" and \\"Sliver.\\"<br />But those aren't what is really important. What makes this a perfect album is \\"You Know You're Right,\\" surfacing eight years after it was recorded and staining a stagnant music industry with actual art.  <br />The song is exactly what Kurt Cobain was best at, making people squirm and gawk.  That is something this CD will make you do during its whole length...showing once again only Kurt Cobain has been able to make music that changed the industry in the '90s.
B00005JM09|5.0|I just saw T-3 AND THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE BEST OF THE TERMINATOR SERIES.My only compaint--No Linda Hamilton.Otherwise, great movie. A must see and a real mindblower.You don't want to miss this one!
B00008OLYN|5.0|The best non-death metal CD I've ever heard comes from the best death metal band I've ever listened to; Opeth.  The disc contains eight wonderful tracks, all of which are hauntingly beautiful.  Akerfeldt is great on vocals, and you wouldn't believe this was the same guy growling on Morningrise if someone had played both CDs for you for the first time without informing you.<br />All of the songs are great, but I love &quot;Windowpane,&quot; &quot;Closure,&quot; and &quot;To Rid The Disease.&quot;  <br />I saw Opeth play at Irving Plaza on July 17th with Porcupine Tree.  This was the greatest concert I've ever been to.  As it was their Damnation tour, they played only mellow stuff.  They flawlessly played pretty much all of Damnation and did a wonderful job of older songs, &quot;To Bid You Farewell,&quot; &quot;Benighted,&quot; and &quot;The Face of Melinda.&quot;<br />You may also like Porcupine Tree's &quot;In Absentia&quot; which Steven Wilson (Opeth's producer, who wrote the lyrics for &quot;Death Whispered a Lullabye&quot;) and company were touring along with Opeth to support.<br />Damnation is a great CD and everyone should be forced to listen to it.
014028009X|4.0|This is a great book, whether you've seen the movie or not.  If you have seen the movie it takes some getting used to as it is a bit different.  A few of my favorite scenes from the movie were not included but many were. The character of Mark Darcy was not as developed as in the movie and neither was the conflict between Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.  That said, this is a great book if you like the british diary style of writing.
B000002NIW|4.0|well, this one's very good. not as awesome as adrenaline, but still a very good addition to the collection.  the melodic parts aren't all bad and there's still a hefty dose of screaming.   There's even a camio appearance by max cavalera on vocals and guitar in &quot;headup&quot; (the best song on the cd) so it keeps ya happy.  the hidden track at the end is nothing to get stirred up about and not worth the 30 minutes of silence you have to skip through to get there, and that's always a disappointment of sorts, but oh well.  in short, good, but get adrenaline first.
6305603847|4.0|The wall is perhaps one of the greatest films from a director and a filmakers perspective. The shots are brilliantly composed and thought of, and flow consistently throughout the film. Some of the most appealing shots are at the beginning of the film and one of the most artistic scenes of all time can be found through the flow of the main characters insanity being interlaced within the boy running across the field and away from the mental patient. <br />In terms of actual appeal and plot, The Wall is actually quite decent until the ending (at the approaching of the trial). Unfortunately if you don't appreciate the music of Pink Floyd it is very unlikely that you will appreciate this film, seeing as it is composed to the music of their &quot;rock opera&quot; album, The Wall. It is very likely that if you are not a Pink Floyd enthusiast you will maintain interest past the first half hour and the events will seem pointless and not organized very well.<br />Nonetheless, if you are an art student or a film student this is defenitely a film that you MUST, not should, MUST see. However if you are just an avid movie-goer this is one movie that you should just consider passing (unless you happen to be a Pink Floyd fan).
B000009DUY|5.0|The soundtrack to Saving Private shows John Williams at his best.  The \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" and \\"The Last Battle\\" are songs that will be remembered forever as the best pieces of music ever made for a war movie.  \\"Omaha Beach\\" and \\"Approaching the Enemy\\" are also great pieces of music that bring together themes of heroism, tragedy, and victory.  This soundtrack didn't just focus on the depression and pschological elements of World War II, but it also brought out themes that seemed to claim a purpose.  Every piece of music in this soundtrack seemed to help bring out that this particular war (even though the most deadly and horrific the world had ever seen since) had a purpose and it's veterans should be honored for liberating and saving western democracy. Above all \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is the best soundtrack i've ever heard and probably will stay that way for a very long time.
0792164903|4.0|Really scary and sometimes really funny.  These words basically summarize this wonderful adaption of Washington Irving's classic tale.  Although the story is almost not at all similar to the book, in watching it, you won't care.  You'll be to absorbed in the story of Icabod Crane (Depp), an investigator sent to investigate murder in a small Dutch village called Sleepy Hollow.  Of course, the murders are cause to the vengeful spirit of a hessian killed in the village's Western Woods.  Maby plot twists and great acting make this a great movie.  I totally recommend it.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|Rowen Atkinson is Johnny English, a man working at MI7 (though parts of the movie say MI5) as support to the field agents.  When all the agents die, he is given the opportunity to protect the Crown Jewels, which get stolen from under his nose.  He is then assigned to find out who stole the Jewels and retrieve them.  Followed by his assistant, whom Johnny is constantly giving secret agent advise to, he embarks on this mission.<br />Granted, this movie is another spoof of the James Bond movies, but while others compare it to Austin Powers with a little Bean and The Naked Gun mixed in, I would prefer to compare it to the Pink Panther/Inspector Clouseau movies - only much funnier.  Now, mind you, I rarely see comedy films in the theatre and most comedies in my opinion are almost never really funny, the films may get at best a smile out of me with their humor.  This movie actually had some lines that made me chuckle (the Austin Powers movies got me to smile).  While most of the movie's plot is predictable, the scene where Johnny finally gets his man, Pascal Sauvage (played by John Malkovich) is a refreshing twist on the roles of England's government.  The only thing that comes to mind of what I didn't like in this film was John Malkovich's very horrible attempt at creating a Frenchman's accent while speaking English. The best he was able to give sounded more Creole, or Cajun, which while the latter is a dialect of French and both are common in Louisiana, they are not true to the country he is supposed to represent.  What I thought was very interesting and even a spoof in its own right, was that the main title theme was performed by a group called Bond.
B00005JM09|4.0|Really awesome special effects and a new Terminator!  These are only a few of the new and awesome installmts this movie offers for fans of Ah-nuld's android series.  Although Arnold (I can't spell his last name) is the only returning cast member (except for John's mom's doctor making a cameo) this film still is great with an ending and plot that actually makes sense and leaves the viewer with a thirst for more.  How often does this happen?  Great entertainment, go see it.
0345440803|4.0|Hogg and Blau use a very workable, applicable style to deal with parenting a toddler: as I am on my fourth toddler, I can attest that the techniques are valuable and easily used in parenting.<br />I especially appreciate the step by step approach and belief in \\"conscious\\" parenting instead of parenting-by-the-numbers.  The suggestions and notes from \\"real\\" people via email interspersed further give the book a personalized, realistic flavor.<br />The ending chapters about having another baby and valuing relationships are very much a part of parenting the toddler.  My only wish is there was a touch more in regards to collaborative-parenting  with both parents being consistent Baby Whisperers.
B00004RFFS|5.0|....And so did this movie! Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Kirsten Dunst were all Fabulous in this movie. The plot was great, sad, dark, and scary at times. It's one of those few, rare movies that are darkly beautiful and utterly terrifying at the same time......  I loved it!
B00009RDGA|5.0|With a subtle directorial hand, Peter Bogdanovich just let his thespians do their jobs here, and thus they carried the whole film into the amazingly charming entertainment that it is today. Are there any deep, philosophical messages to analyze here? Perhaps not, but it's certainly touching and the final scenes will have many viewers holding back tears because of the fact that ten-year-old Tatum O'Neal has successfully and seemingly effortlessly endeared herself to them. The pairing of Moses and Addie truly do make for one of cinema's most memorable love-hate relationships, and by the finale it's terrible for anyone to have to watch it come to an end. And could the Academy have been anymore flat-out right here by awarding Tatum O'Neal Best Supporting Actress? It's obviously one of the most audacious wins in the history of the Awards, and a deserved one at that. <br />Bogdanovich didn't mind simply placing his camera in one set location and just leaving it there because he had the fullest confidence that his cast would make the film compelling, but some stylization is evident here nonetheless. It's interesting to watch shots that withdraw from the action completely, framing its characters from a vast distance. And it truly seems as if this movie couldn't have been filmed in anything other than the stark black-and-white, which is iridescently brought to life anyway thanks to each and every performance. <br />Some aspects of the story do border on ridiculousness, of course - are we to believe that Moses and Addie simply had great luck in finding these amazingly gullible people? But it doesn't really matter in the long run anyway, because `Paper Moon' will really make you smile.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|Rowan Atkinson has been a staple of British comedy for over 20 years.  He plays a most familar character to people familar to him, the bumbler who tries to bluff his way through things.<br />Many of the scenes in this movie are predicatable but funny  many others were just out there and laugh out loud VERY laugh out loud.  Where I was the crowd went from one extreme to another.<br />It isn't a movie to be seen twice, the predicatable laughs are still laughs but the laugh out loud scenes are just not to be missed.<br />worth the money, not sure if its a buyer
B000002U94|3.0|This sounds live, in concert. Can't remember any songs that stand out. Good lead, cymbals on drum, and bass. Better when the tape don't break.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead music has always been unclassifiable by its sound. They always make inventive music whether they're being rock or electronic.<br />Such is the case with Hail to the Thief, an overt anti-government  message... although perhaps not intended for the masses. While the messages will of course be outdated as people find new things to whine about (there will always be something to complain about), what matters is the music.<br />I enjoyed this album because whatever approach Radiohead (not just Yorke) took to the song, it was totally different than the stereotype of the kind of music. The electronic beats are eclectic and rhytmic... definitely unlike the hip hop rhythms of Linkin Park's RockRap (or is it RocKrap? jk jk), while the all out rock portions aren't grungy (or pippy like Good Charlotte)and have organic feels to them.<br />What I didn't like was that the songs felt unended, there was no sense of being completed although perhaps that's Radiohead saying \\"This isn't over yet.\\" Perhaps, but at least we can understand what Yorke is saying, even if it is totally anti-sentimental.
0780020685|4.0|Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of all times in virtually every knowledgeable reviwer's list, the Criterion Collection's Seven Samurai DVD is without a doubt the finest version available with English Subtitles.  If you are fluent in Japanese, however, and own a code-free DVD player you may want to consider the new Toho Studio's production, which is part of their &quot;The Kurosawa Masterworks Collection&quot;(sic). It is also available separately. Toho digitally remastered the originals for best sound and image, but this version has only Japanese subtitles.
B00009M6VJ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for the plot.I liked Kevin Spacey's performance, but the rest of the movie felt flat, undimensional. The story is great whether you are for or against capital punishment.  Ever  see a movie where you think &quot;I'd rather read the 'book'&quot;?   Well this was one of those movies for me.<BR>But the &quot;endings&quot; are worth watching the movie for. Very good surprises.
B00005QGAT|3.0|I've been looking for this '80's song,couldn't find it anywhere among Michael Jackson albums,finally heard it playing on 'digital television'(pay t.v.),under the name of 'Destiny'-The Jacksons. You got to here this song,it ranks up there with 'Billy Jean','Thriller',and 'Beat it'. This song rates a 10 star rating,in my opinion,check it out.......
B000002KKK|4.0|The general concensus among critics seems to be that \\"Tres Hombres\\" is ZZ Top's finest album.    Well, I disagree. \\"Tres Hombres\\" is a fine album, but \\"Deg?ello\\" is better. Not by much, sure, but it has a stronger selection of songs with more truly memorable ones, such as the delightful blues-n'-boogie of \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\", \\"Fool For Your Stockings\\" and \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\\".    It's not perfect, sure, not everything is great, but nothing is less than good, and \\"Degello\\" is one of the few truly essential purchases for any ZZ Top fan.
B000000W5B|5.0|The Rolling Stones have made so much music and so many albums that even lots of diehard fans probably won't claim to like everything the Stones have done.  I know I'm in the minority but I really didn't get into the songs they played on the radio from &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; except for &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, which they still play a lot on classic stations.  I wasn't inspired to buy the album and tentatively decided I wasn't into their current sound.  But that all changed in the summer of '73.  I thought some of the songs from &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; sounded great.  It was the summer before my last year in high school and I still remember those summer nights in August, turning the radio up when &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; came on.  The guitar at the beginning of &quot;Angie&quot; is beautiful, and hearing it on the radio while driving to school in September was great.  I was back &quot;into&quot; the Stones sound.  I bought the album in October.  Maybe most people don't but I really like &quot;Dancing with Mr. D.&quot;  I think it's one of the best songs on this album.  &quot;100 Years Ago&quot; is good too and additional musicians like Nick Hopkins, Billy Preston, Ian Stewart, Chuck Finley and Bobby Keys create a Stones sound that is unique.  All the songs are good but some stand out more than others.  &quot;Coming Down Again&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot; are also good and there's nothing quite like having a good car stereo and playing &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; at full volume.
B00005OM4K|5.0|CCR is high on the list of bands that made me glad I saved all my old records.  As was the case with most bands from the pre-CD era, the first CD reissues of their albums had sound quality that seemed thin enough to tear, so you were better off with the pops and skips on the original vinyl.  That finally changed a few years ago with the remastered versions of all their albums, and this collection features all of those (including liner notes and pictures) plus a bit more.  <br />With nearly every note the four guys from El Cerrito are known to have recorded under their various band names from 1961-1972, this is about as close to a complete collection as we're ever likely to get.  (The infamous \\"lost\\" 1962 single of \\"Yes You Did\\" and \\"Now You're Not Mine\\" is still lost, but everything else appears to be here.)  So unless you bought all the remastered CDs individually, this collection is well worth the price tag to any serious fan.  Creedence was all but unique among singles-oriented bands in that most of their album cuts have aged just as well as their hits, and it shows here.  If anything, relatively obscure songs like \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\" and \\"Ramble Tamble\\" sound fresher than \\"Proud Mary\\" and some of the other classics which oldies and classic rock stations have done their best to play into the ground.  Even the much-maligned \\"Mardi Gras\\" album proves not to be the disaster it was once made out to be (although it is still their weakest link).  Stu Cook's \\"Door to Door\\" actually rocks pretty convincingly, and most of the other selections have their moments as well.<br />One word of advice:  If you're thinking about buying this collection only for the pre-CCR songs, I wouldn't recommend it.  Some of the early sides are quite good (\\"You Better Be Careful\\" and \\"Fight Fire\\" would have sounded at home on their first album) and even the weaker efforts are an interesting look at the roots of one of rock's all time greatest bands; but bottom line, there is a reason why they didn't become famous until 1968.  But if there are any other holes in your collection, this is the perfect addition to it.
B000002GYI|5.0|Of the entire electronic music genre, there isn't a band I admire more than Kraftwerk.  This is easily one of my favorite CD's, out of a collection of about 200.<BR>When this album came out in 1982, there were probably many people who didn't understand the concept of this band.  Maybe even a little frightened by the possibilities of a computer-driven world, which is exactly the subject the whole album touches on. <BR>'Pocket Calculator' is a such a fun song, but 'Numbers' is so cool, I still have never heard a song quite like it.  Completely electronic, but still manages to touch the warm, emotional side of us (fans of Kraftwerk)  .I love the fact that their music isn't overly 'aggressive,' like a lot of modern techno music seems to be. I have heard their songs sampled so many times, which could be a bad thing, but is not.  Those people understand, as I do, that this is one of those bands that is just timeless.
6305252521|5.0|Directed by Peter Weir - that's a good thing to start with.  If you're sceptical about Jim Carrey after all those silly movies he's done - rest assure, he proves that he can really act in this brilliant film.  The film is a sad tale about a man unaware that his life is being broadcast on its own devoted channel (since he was born).  He eventually discovers the truth and it leads to some interesting scenarios.  It also makes you realise how bizarre Reality TV is, and how viewers can be so dependant on television to satisfy their own boring lives.<br />DVD SUMMARY:<BR>The print of this film is simply awesome, crystal clear with an impressive 5.1 soundtrack to boot - take note of the scene where the rain is falling on Truman (the sound is incredible in surround).  The DVD is let down however by  sad lack of extras - I mean, c'mon ... there must be some deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage?  A trailer and teaser trailer is thrown in, so that's better than nothing.  Aside from these issues, the movie is so fantastic, it's worth getting the DVD!  A brilliant film!
B000002OX7|5.0|A classic. I can't say anyomre. This album by &quot;the Who&quot; is fished out of my collection every so often after many, many years of enjoyment. Don't underate the work of &quot;The who&quot; because they get airplay at times on classic rock stations...
B00008LDPU|2.0|I was eagerly anticipating the release of Animatrix.  Now, after viewing it, I am very disappointed in the product as a whole and even somewhat offended.<br />First, the Good.  \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" was incredible.  Clearly the best of the features.  Some of the most expressive and impressive animation I have ever seen.  \\"Kid's Story\\" was intriguing and clarifies a question I had after watching \\"Matrix: Reloaded.\\"  \\"Beyond\\" was also very interesting in that it shows a fascinating concept of a glitch in the Matrix and does it in a somewhat charming manner.<br />Now the Bad.  I found the animation in most of the features to be extraordinarily poor.  This is not because I am an anime hater!  When it comes to Japanimation, I can take it or leave it depending on each individual work.  Yes, I understand that there is a cultural difference between Japan and the US when it comes to animation, but I know what I like.  What I don't like is human figures that are so grotesquely drawn that they become a distraction to watch (the best example of this is \\"World Record\\").  While I mentioned above that I liked \\"Kid's Story,\\" the animation in that was so poorly drawn (albeit probably on purpose) that it became difficult to follow the action.  Of course, there is also the tendency in anime to make things excessively gory, which I also find a tad unnecessary.<br />And finally, the Offensive.  \\"The Second Renaissance\\" was absolutely terrible.  The animation was decent (save the gore mentioned previously) but the story was trite and insulting.  The viewer is expected to endure countless jabs at the Christian faith and the depiction of everyone in the world, with the exception of the machines' \\"liberal sympathizers,\\" as blood-thirsty, intolerant, hateful, war-mongering cretins, especially Americans.  We are then shown several well-known scenes from the worst of human history including communist Vietnam, communist China, and Nazi Germany.  However, the scenes are altered to place robots in the victims' places and, although none of the original scenes used as inspiration in this feature occurred in the US or involved Americans, they now all feature Americans as the villains.  I know that the intent was to push the limits and make the story very dramatic, even uncomfortable, but it blew past that line and went straight to contentious and vile.<br />Overall, I gave this DVD a 2-star rating, out of respect for \\"Final Flight of the Osiris.\\"  Otherwise, it would easily have earned the lowest rating.obots in the victims' places and, although none of the original scenes used as inspiration in this feature occurred in the US or involved Americans, they now all feature Americans as the villains.

B000002JEV|5.0|Why this was so easily forget when promoting the 2003 release of \\"How the West was won\\" is puzzling. Pagey & crew are amply represented in the recordings for BBC sessions. Alot of the material on these discs are reflective of the bands early years from '69 to '71. The first disc is selected tracks with a few rare items, while the second disc is a complete hour long performance from 1971. The sound quality of course is a product of being released in 1997. Despite these recordings being aged their are some true gems of enthusiastic renditions of material intended for broadcast on BBC radio promoting the bands first through third albums. The first disc contains different skilled & passionate renditions of their blues 'cover' material (sorry LZ) available in differing variations that make this disc worth listening to, EVEN IF You've HEARD all this stuff 100 times before. This was Led Zeppelin's blues rock in it's most earnest. The performances here are the young and hungry young zeppelin not the sloppy dinosaur rock fodder of \\"THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME\\" -or- the predictably self indulgent \\"HOW THE WEST WAS WON.\\" Of course,being a live LeD Zeppelin, it still has an 18 min. version of \\"DazedandConfused\\" on this second disc?! ;-)
B0000025DR|5.0|Succeeding at pop music in the 60's could grant you critical immortality. Just ask the Beach Boys or Beatles. But in the 70's,while pure pop could make you rich, it won't get you any respect. After a few Art Rock albums and their classical concept &quot;El Dorado,&quot; ELO found their commercial niche in 1975's Face The Music. It's not yet the pure, completely commercial pop of &quot;Discovery&quot; because Jeff here still sings about more than just luv. The strings are less in evidence here and there are fewer loud guitar parts but Jeff's vocals sound cleaner. This is prime ELO. <BR>It also helps that Jeff was here still willing to share vocals with Kelly Groucutt. Kelly sings and sounds a lot like Jeff and their trading lines on 'Nightrider' makes it one of ELO's best. This is ELO's most consistent album and belongs up there with the 5 or 6 best pop albums ever recorded.
B000002I7R|5.0|&quot;Pictures at Eleven&quot; appears like 'a solo album from that guy from Led Zeppelin' type of deal, rather than a singer trying to find a voice. Perhaps he wasn't sure if zeppelin were on hiatus or something. This disc succeeds at presenting Robert as he was at the time, not really trying to cash in on zep or move away too fast. The perfect balance between retaining an indentity as a solo artist and acknowledging your past as 1/4 of Led Zeppelin. Additionally, unlike Plant's future work, there are really no dogs or bombs or stinkers or awkward moments (e.g.-&quot;If I were a carpentar&quot; cover). To each his own, I suppose; but I enjoy this album. Not comfortable to admit it, but I like  especially &quot;slow dancer&quot;, &quot;Moonlight in Samosa&quot; and &quot;Fat Lip&quot;(sp?)...The best all around Plant effort. He sounds as if he wrote songs for a band with him being 1/4 member, much in the vein of Led Zeppelin's approach, which contrasts to his &quot;solo star w/ backing band style&quot; of later years. Good for fans of zep and other zep members too.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I reviewed this movie for Rambles and fell in love with it. It is a movie for all ages to enjoy. There are characters for everyone to identify with. (My heart went out to the father, but he kept me laughing out loud through the entire movie with his wit and sarcasm.)It has great depth or can be enjoyed simply at surface value. I can't believe this came from a Shakespeare classic. The modern adaptation fascinates me. Get it today and contemplate this form of literary wizardry. You won't be disappointed.
B000002C1V|3.0|&quot;not now john&quot; is the only song that ever gets much play on my cd player 9 years after buying it. The rest of the album is a slightly depressing follow-up to &quot;The Wall&quot; it seems. It's okay, but a little bit of a grasping attempt at being pretentious by Roger Waters. Great for fans of Pink Floyd or Roger Waters or classic rock, though really NOT for fans of progressive or art rock genres.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I actually felt that Julianne did a better job witht he Southern dialect than Foster. Sorry Foster fans, but she dropped the ball a couple of times in Silence of the Lambs. Julianne is much more believable in this role and I hope to see her in a sequel.<br />My publisher at Rambles thinks I am a scarey person because I suggested sending a list of rude people to Hannibal for his menu and because I said this is one of the best love stories of all time. Normally I do not like romance stories or movies, but this one is off the scale. Hannibal might be a cannibal (what man doesn't have a quirk or two), but he is still capable of the deepest love known to mankind. The ending to the movie just breaks my heart! Okay, so it IS supposed to be a horror movie. But who could ever be scared of such a loving, caring man?????<br />I love everything about this movie and prefer it to Silence of the Lambs, although that was an excellent movie and will always be one of my faves. This DVD is worth its weight in gold!
B00004R99U|1.0|I'm 16 now, and I remember most Disney movies with that warm, fuzzy feeling. I was at a friend's house and noticed Pocahontas and thought, I haven't seen that in years! Let's watch it! Then she said, We both remember the first one. I think we have the second one somewhere, let's watch that! So, we popped it in, and stared in dismay as it got worse...and worse...and worse. The history, for one, destroyed it, since I tend to like accurate things. Then, Smith comes in and the other guy(Rolf?) is heartbroken. Mmm hmmm. And Pocahontas saves Smith in the first one, and chooses Rolf in the second, and Smith WALKS AWAY like nothing happened? Take human nature into consideration: he would NOT have been so peaceful. Well, I guess if the kids didn't see/didn't like the first one, they'd like it. I personally hated it with a passion. Don't buy this. Rent it or borrow it. Please.
B00005JM09|4.0|I am not going to be like everyone and write about how James Cameron did not do this movie. Who cares, he is not GOD.<br />I do not understand the designations for the Terminator. In T1, he was a Cyberdine systems model 101. No mention of T-800.<BR>In T2, he was once again a Cyberdine systems model 101. No mention in the movie about being a T-800. Not until I saw the teaser trailer years later did I realise it was a T-800 model 101.<BR>In T3, Arnie refers to his previous incarnation as a T-101. In reviews, he is called the T-850. <br />This is so confusing.<br />T2 was based in 1994, despite being filmed in 1991. John could not have been any older than 10 years, possibly on 9. There were references to the war being in 3 years, which counting back from 1997 would make 1994. He was not 13 years, despite the narration in T3 indicating he was that age.<BR>If the war didnt happen in 1997, Kyle Reese would have his normal childhood, but what is stopping him from being caught in the nuclear war? The odds of him taking cover on both days of the war would be against him. If he did not survive the war, the whole space-time continuim would be ruined.<br />T3 can leave your mind wandering for days afterwards as to the glitches in the story.... but isnt the whole point of a movie to get you thinking about it, going back and watching it again. Not many movies blow my mind these days. This one did.
B00005N5S5|5.0|If you are a fan of the Terminator Series, or a DVD producer wanting to see how to properly release a Special Edition, look no further.  The SUPERCLEAN video is the best I have seen....this looks like it was filmed yesterday!  They said this was a Digital Master from a Hi-Definition transfer, well I GUESS SO!  And the added 5.1 audio is a nice bonus.  Not on par with todays movies audio, but considering it was originally MONO the improvement is fantastic...and definitely close enough to make it sound great.  This one's a no brainer.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|If you like fast cars and hot chicks, 2fast2furious is the movie for you.  You need watch the 1st Fast And The Furious Movie 1st tho.  I could not believe all of the dinamic special effects in the movie, it was off the hizzle my bizzle.  I gave it 5 stars, The blockbuster movie of the summer.  And while your at it, check out the awesome soundtracks for the Fast And The Furious Series.  Full of great Jams, and awesome beats.<BR>                                 ~Neo~
1400034779|4.0|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a sweet and simple tale--an easy read that despite its simplicity will have you pondering what goes on in the novel.  The novel doesn't have much of what one would call a plot, but rather contains a series of vignettes in which Mma Ramotswe recounts various clients she has helped in her detective work.  She is an unconventional detective, and goes about solving the riddles posed to her in surprising ways.  She also shares her personal history, telling us how she got to where she is.  It is a charming tale, charming and enjoyable.
B0000508U6|5.0|&quot;Don't Panic&quot; when you come to the realization that this [British Import] Coldplay is one of the best bands to take the world-by-storm, in decades. I &quot;Shiver&quot; at the thought of listening to the music on this CD. It's breathtaking! Some &quot;Spies&quot; at a London brew-pub told me, that they're the UK's &quot;best kept secret.&quot; Romantic &quot;Sparks&quot; fly and things begin to heat-up, with plenty of love going around with Chris Martin's enigmatic voice. Some people are afraid of the color &quot;Yellow.&quot; Well, I'm not afraid of it. It's one of my favorite tracks on the CD. You'll have no &quot;Trouble&quot; at all, getting your friends to warm-up to this CD. You will need some &quot;Parachutes&quot; before you go sky-diving, beacuse you will fall to the earth at a &quot;High Speed.&quot; &quot;We Never Change&quot; our old habits, by listening to and supporting this bands music. &quot;Everythings Not Lost&quot; it's just that we need to give this band the respect it deserves, for all the hard work they put into this album.
B000002UB6|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet.  It's the Beatles, they are the foundation of rock in almost everyone's eyes.  This was their last album and it is one of my favorites!  If you're a Beatles fan, I'm sure you've already heard this so, just buy it and enjoy it!
B000002UAU|5.0|This record is perfect from every aspect that can be viewed from. Every song blends with the next, and the finished product is flawless. Too bad this can't be said for the booklet that comes with the CD.  On the beautiful &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;, they mispell two of the lyrics. Think they should have proofread the greatest album of the generation.
B000009QPG|5.0|This album more than deserves the 5 stars it was awarded. Im going to give a Track by Track review of this album.<br />War Ensemble 5/5 - This track is killer. I enjoy every single second, especially during the solo Possibly one of my favorite Slayer songs ever<br />Blood Red 4.2/5 - Good solid track. Good chorus. good solo. the usual we've come to expect from Slayer and doesn't let down.<br />Spirit In Black 4.8/5 - The opening riff to this song is a masterpiece. Great Song but just below perfect (5/5 being perfect)<br />Expendable Youth 4/5 - Slows things up a bit for this track. However still solid<br />Dead Skin Mask 5/5 - Any thing I say about this song will not give it the justice it deserves<br />Hallowed Point 3/5 - An above average song. As far as im concerned the solo saves it. <br />Skeletons of Society 4.5/5 - One of the first tracks I ever heard from Slayer and hooked me.<br />Temptation 4.2/5 - For some reason the voice in the background annoys me, but the rest of the song makes up for it.<br />Born of Fire 4.5/5 - Excellent song. I like the way it starts out.<br />Seasons In The Abyss 5/5 - Wow I was blown away by this song. This would definitly make my personal Slayer greatest hits package.
6300213668|3.0|It is a classic for many people including myself with great music, but let's talk about the whole movie. It is extremely sexually explicit, with indecent refrences the whole way through; it is so offensive that I will not buy the video because of the PG rating. I will record it off of TBS or TNT. The same uncut version on the video on TNT, is rated TV-14 (which is still an understatement) and I still have a hard time watching it. I am waiting for this movie on TBS to record because they edit the unneccessary content, and believe it or not, it is STILL rated TV-14! Because of this, I think \\"How can the MPAA consider this PG?\\" Great music, but I will not watch a dirty classic or dirty movie whatsoever.
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|I was first introduced to this movie when my girlfriend demanded that we watch it.  I've never been a fan of martial arts movies, so I was extremely iffy about it.  I also am not a fan of subtitles, so this movie was in the trash as far as I was concerned, but being the good boyfriend I am, I decided I could tough through a two hour movie and maybe catch a couple of z's while I was at it.  But after the movie started, my opinion almost immedietely changed.<br />From the opening scene this movie grabs you and doesn't let go.  It is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  It is creative and the effects aren't as cheesy as you might think.  I sat with my jaw dropped for two hours, thinking to myself \\"How many other movies have I blown off that might be great?\\"<br />I can't wait for the theatrical release where it will be dubbed in English.  I hope they come out with a DVD with an English dub too.
B0000035E7|4.0|yea they're not as accessible as later stuff but for 89 i guess this was a pretty damn original album. Cashing in on a baseline as catchy/dynamic as the one on Lounge Act is practically a one time thing for any band, but these songs are rocking as well.<BR>My favs off the top of my head: Obviously &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot; but also &quot;Downer&quot; &quot;negative creep&quot; and the opener &quot;blew&quot;
B00008PX8P|5.0|The recently Led Zeppelin live material (both the 3 CD set and the DVD) is a godsend for all Led Zeppelin fans who (1) were unable to see the hammer of gods back in the 1970s, or (2) regret buying The Song Remains the Same live album released.  The inferior double album the Song Remains the Same had been up until now, the only Led Zeppelin live material available.  But now all inequities have been rectified, and Jimmy Page has collected an extensive amount of material (almost 8 hours, including the DVD and CD) of Led Zeppelin at its best.<br />Speaking in terms of the DVD set, I found the selection of material good.  It captures the band at all of its key stages of development: (1) Royal Albert Hall, 1970-their early days as virtuoso bluesmen (2) Madison Square Garden, 1972-the height of the band's popularity, and unfortunately, at their most excessive; it should be noted that this footage was taken from the same concert that was showcased in the Song Remains the Same (3) Earl's Court, 1975-the band's redemption as a live act (4) Knebworth, 1979-the band establishing itself as arena rock legends.<br />This DVD set should be enough to satisfy fans for years.  The performances are incredible, and this footage should now be considered a must for all Zep collections .
0553582445|3.0|I had already read the Farseer Trilogy before I picked this book up.  I was a big fan of Assasins Aprentice and of Assasins Quest, however, Royal Assasin was just too slow without enough plot development to be a good book.  It is one thing to have a slow book that gives backround stories at ever turn.  This is the way The Wind of the Forelands is written and it is excellent.  Instead, Hobb writes about the scenery and feelings in such detail that it becomes very tiresome.  If you like extended scenery detail, then this is a good book.  However, if you are like me and like either action or backround stories, then this book will disapoint, much like Royal Assasin.
B00009RGBS|5.0|ok...First of...this movie is one of the best musicals i've seen so far. Moulin Rouge wasgreat too, but the songs weren't original.Maybe some of he lyrics i guess, but most of the songs were from Madonna. That's not bad thing, but it takes away all the fun. On the other hand, Chicago was very entertaining,plus interesting.(i guess it's cuz i'm from chicago.) Anyway, i don't know if these songs were original, but it made me sing them over and over again. Moulin Rouge had one perfect scene, and it was sorta weird from there. Both movies are very funny, but i found Chicago MORE interesting. Although I know the baroque,classical,romantic eras of music, i wonder if the music in moulin rouge was correct. cuz when they sang material girl and stuff,i didn't think there was technical music.(disco or something futuristic.) Anyway, Chicago's a great movie. no wonder it got multiple academy awards.
B000059XUO|5.0|Yes The Crow will always be remembered as the film that Brandon Lee was accidentally shot and killed on. That aside what we have here is one of the few truly great comic-book adaptations put on film. The film is dark (with almost every scene at night or in the pouring rain) but it has such a cool edge to you you can't help but enjoy it (altough it's not for everyone) The movie is about Eric Draven who is brutally murdered along with his fiancee the night before their wedding. One year later Draven is resurrected and with the a Crow guiding him. Hunts down his killers one by one extracting his revenge.<br />The real meat of the movie is in Brandon Lee's performance. When he's extracting his revenge you find yourself wanting to cheer for this guy but at the same time kind of feeling sorry for his victims. Lee is relentless in his pursuit but he's also human. This isn't some mindless killing machine. This is a human being brought back to extract revenge for the horrible things that were done to him and his fiancee The Crow is just a really great cark, cool, goth movie. One of the few adaptations of a graphic novel that is truly worthy.

B00003CXA3|4.0|This is a really enjoyable film thats relativly discreet (at times) in what it portrays i've watched it a number of times since buying the DVD and have enjoyed it every time i have seen it so far so what more can i say if you want a good well plotted film then this is one at the top of the scale.
B00005QDW1|5.0|&quot;Rock Steady&quot; is a departure from their well-known ska-punk sound. Many think this an experimental album.  It's not. This is actually returning to their roots.  This is the type of music they performed when they first started in 1986, and before guitarist Tom Dumont joined No Doubt, therefore giving them a rock sound.  Some tracks revisit the 80's musical style, &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;, with the help of The Cars former lead singer Ric Ocasek.  Every track has its own style of dance.  Ballads &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;In My Head&quot; brilliantly blends reggae, therefore still making it danceable.  Grammy winning &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and William Orbit produced(Madonna &quot;Ray of Light&quot;)&quot;Making Out&quot; have a unique blend of techno that more today's dance artists need.  Gwen Stefani knows how to deliver the perfect emotions through her singing, especially on &quot;Running&quot;.<br />Those who are looking for a great pop/dance album besides those image-selling performers will love &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.  As will rock fans, especially the rock-driven track &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;.  This will be a classic No Doubt album in a few years.  A rock band proving that they can master pop music proves that they are truly talented and broadened artists.  Meaning, No Doubt will be around years to come.
B000089RVX|5.0|Well, what can I say? thw First time I heard Bring Me To Life I was blown away, and the rest of the album is equally as mind blowing.<br />The chilling voice of Amy haunts every track, the first track sets the mood for the rest of the record. Going Under is a superb starting song, it's spooky beginning gives you goosebumps! The second track was a hit across the world and is a classic. Other Tracks mix the heavy rock guitar riffs and chords with Amy's haunting voice, to create an all round amazing album!
B000031XCR|5.0|Though it doesn't have all of her greatest hits, these tracks still make this compilation worth buying the CD.  Half of it is her past hits, and the other half is her newly recorded material.  &quot;Power of Love&quot; is the perfect song to start the CD as it defines the meaning of her career and the remaining tracks.  The rest of her greatest hits will be classics, and they'll continue to be wedding favorites.  &quot;All The Way...A Decade of Song&quot; would not have been complete without her most successful track, &quot;Titanic&quot; favorite &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;.<br />Her newly recorded section begins brilliantly with the upbeat &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot;, a dedication to her husband who was battling skin cancer during its release.  Her emotional track &quot;All the Way&quot; is a perfect duet with the late Frank Sinatra.  &quot;The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face&quot;, originally recorded by Roberta Flack, is another wonderful remake.  Shania Twain and she sing together beautifully on the track &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot;.  This compilation ends perfectly with the emotional &quot;Live&quot;, which defines the future of her career.  <br />&quot;All The Way...A Decade of Song&quot; is the perfect CD release to inform the world that she's taking time off to have a family and refuel.  The time of the release, some questioned if she would ever come back.  This gave these songs that extra emotional value.  Either way, her career will always be remembered, and she will always be one of the greatest singers in the world.

Reading through the other reviews I am once again wont to ponder why some members of the religious right don't invest their considerable energy in doing good in the world rather than waste their time in slagging off an author who holds a contrary opinion.<br />My criticisms of this book are literary not religious - though I feel I must tip a nod in the direction of the reviewer who suggested I might be \\"shocked\\" by the \\"Gay\\" Angels. What? Shocked that an Angel could be gay and good and heroic? (Hello!! And welcome to the 21st Century!!) I was not shocked. Neither was I particularly impressed given that the main \\"Gay Angel\\" conforms to the prissy queen sterotype.<br />Book three failed. And it failed dismally. And most dramatically in the form of continuity. I spent all of book one and two hoping that Mrs Coulter would get her just deserts. And what happens in book three?!?! Is it the same character??? The through line is completely lost! And the resolution struck me as totally unsatisfactory.<br />I would recommend Harry Potter. I wouldn't recommend this.

B00005QDW1|5.0|Hella Good- It's a very rock/ska type song.  I like it alot! 5/5<br />Hey Baby- More of a pop song, with strange lyrics but a cool tune!  5/5<br />Making Out- A great tune! 4.5/5<br />Underneath It All- Sort of slow, but a great tune and lyrics, plus a really cool jamaican part! 5/5<br />Detective- Sort of funny.  Strange. 4/5<br />Don't Let Me Down- A fun, catchy, upbeat tune and fun lyrics. 5/5<br />Start The Fire- The bagpipes are weird, but its a cool song. 4/5<br />Running- A popular song by them.  It's really meaningful. 5/5<br />In My Head- A stupid song, I think.   STRANGE!  2/5<br />Platinum Blonde Life- A cool, upbeat song with good, yet weird lyrics. 5/5<br />Waiting Room- I hate this song, for some reason! 2/5<br />Rock Steady- It really doesn't do much for me, even though that's the hit of the CD. 3/5
B00004ZB9D|5.0|When I bought this CD three years ago, I played it.  I loved it!  Then my sister noticed this CD.  She asked if it has \\"Are You Going To Go My My\\".  I said \\"yes\\".  Then she asked if it has \\"Let Love Rule\\".  Again, I said \\"yes\\".  Then she looked at the tracks.  She got very excited and said, \\"oh my gosh, it's got all of them.  Can I borrow it?\\"  Indeed, it's got all of them.<BR>  <BR>This is Lenny Kravitz's compilation of his greatest songs from 1989-2000.  These tracks uniquely blend today's rock, 60's flower-power spirit, retro, and 60's/70's Motown R&B.  Few today's rockers have as much talent as Kravitz: performing, songwriting, and guitar.  This CD takes us on a journey to more than his career, he takes us to his personal life then and now, and he takes us to a time of rock & roll that everyone misses.  His lyrics are very meaningful and heartfelt.  Though a compilation, he still manages to prove to his audience that he continues to evolve as an artist, especially on his unreleased catchy track \\"Again\\".  <br />     This CD proves that he will be around for many more years to come.  Soon enough, he'll release \\"Greatest Hits Vol. 2\\".  Lenny Kravitz needs to present this CD to the majority of today's rock artists, the ones that are talentless, which will show them how to write songs and perform them correctly.
B000066NW0|5.0|OK, if you have anything downright rude to say about Avril Lavigne, this isn't your place.  Your insults won't help newcomers to Avril's music.  Go find a chat board to post your junk on.<br />Avril is a great singer.  I really like her songs, and I can't wait til her new album comes out (Don't Tell Me is a GREAT song, by the way)<br />Here are 13 reasons to buy this CD:<br />1. Losing Grip- This is a harder song on the CD.  I really like this song.  The lyrics are so cool and the tune is really upbeat.  I'm glad this is a single.<BR>Fave line: I'm startin' to trip, I'm losin' my grip and I'm in this thing alone.<br />2. Complicated- Right now I really really like this song (for a personal reason;)) and I am totally glad it was her first single.  Who doesn't like the upbeat tempo and the catchy lyrics?  Whenever this song comes on the radio I just wanna sing out loud- it's that type of song.<BR>Fave line: You become somebody else 'round everyone else<br />3. Sk8er Boi- Aww, this one is so cute.  It's not a work of art, but it's fun, it's cute, it's totally Avril.  Come on, you know you like it.  Everyone has to let loose once in a while.<BR>Fave line: Turns on TV, Guess who she sees, Sk8er Boi rockin' up MTV<br />4. I'm With You- This is a breath of fresh air and very different for Avril.  I really like this song, totally glad it was a single.  The music video is really great.  <BR>Fave line: Why is everything so confusing, maybe I'm just out of my mind<br />5. Mobile- You know, I've really grown to like this song.  It's very upbeat and the lyrics tell you kind of about how Avril feels about this whole singer business.  Nice.<BR>Fave line: Hanging from the ceiling, life's a mobile, spinnin' round with mixed feelings, crazy and wild<br />6. Unwanted- No Doubt, the hardest song on this album.  Very good, just enough.  I love this song, especially the chorus, and I can tell Avril has fun singing it.<BR>Fave line: I tried to belong, it didn't seem wrong<br />7. Tomorrow- This, although an excellent song, is probably my least favorite on the album.  It's just kind of boring.  It kind of reminds me of \\"Simple Kind Of Life\\" by No Doubt.  An OK song.<BR>Fave line: When you say that it's gonna be, it always turns out to be a different way<br />8. Anything But Ordinary- This song is so good.  It should have been a single.  It kind of explains how being ordinary is so *yawn* and I totally support that idea.<BR>Fave line: If you look you will see that this world is a beautiful, accident, turbulent, succulent, opulent, permanent no way.<br />9. Things I'll Never Say- This is my favorite song off of the album.  It's the poppiest, and I'm a huge pop fan.  I think it's such a sweet song and shows off Avril's girly side.<BR>Fave line: I'm feeling nervous, trying to be so perfect, cause I know you're worth it.<br />10. My World- This is Avril's autobiography in a song.  This is a very fun song, that has some funny parts to it.  I like this song alot.<BR>Fave line: Where do I belong forever, in who's arms, what time and place<br />11. Nobody's Fool- This used to be my favorite, and still remains a song I love.  I like the idea of not changing into a wannabe.  It's a good song.<BR>Fave line: I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon<br />12. Too Much To Ask- This has always been one of my favorite songs.  It's a ballad- and I like that.  It talks about how someone's not being themselves and it makes Avril impatient.  Good song.<BR>Fave line: You can't see the world through a mirror<br />Naked- This is a nice, light ender to the album.  Not my favorite, but still a good song.<BR>Fave line: This life is like a game sometimes
B00007JVBI|4.0|I first encountered Cat Power in the form of a Rolling Stone interview showcasing Chan Marshall as the oft cliche'd &quot;tortured artist at the of her form.&quot; Nearly a decade ago the number of &quot;tortured artists&quot; performing popular music had reached critical mass. Tastes changed and the demographics began to favor a younger music-buying contingent and their coveted disposable income. The major lables canceled the contracts of most of the &quot;tortured artists&quot;, and what remains are the likes of Justin Timberlake, Pink, and Jennifer Lopez. Now that &quot;tortured artists&quot; have officially become a endangered species we must do whatever we can to support/encourage the development of those who choose carry the flame. However, there no need to take exceptional pity for Cat Power... the music is charming and elegiac, and can stand on it's own without the assistance of critical or popular appeal. Needless to say that it will not be aired by any conventional radio outlet (okay, NPR doesn't really count). You Are Free is best listened to alone, in a quiet space filled with diffused sunlight and mid-afternoon shadows. The album demands alot of patience from the listener and is not immediately satisfying, but after five or more rotations the songs eventually bear their fruit, resulting in a fine vintage.
0451191153|2.0|Ayn Rand is very good at situational descriptions and setting. In this book, the overbearing/awe-inspiring effect Dominique has on the people around her is carried off very well throughout the book, as are the portrayals of Howard Roark, particuarly in the opening scene.  As a whole, though, it's boring and overwrought. Yes, it has an Important Message to get across, which it does (many times) as gracelessly as possible. Ayn Rand is quoted as having said that she always puts the story before the Message in her fiction, but she's mistaken, at least in this case.  This book is a wonderful example of a novel whose ambition exceeds its content. The reader is being told that they shouldn't feel any sense of responsibility to anyone or anything other than their own creative urges. This is a little bit contradictory to Rand's other notion that the only worthwhile enterprise of the individual is to create in a manner beneficial to other people (doesn't that sound a bit like the spirit of altruism she demonizes?), but I'll leave that alone here. It really doesn't take all the proselytizing to get what she has to say across. The Fountainhead tries to be an epic, but there just isn't all that much there.  Plus, we don't really have characters; we get Ideals. The walking, talking things in this book fail to be interesting because they are impossible as real humans. This would be okay if the book were much shorter, but after the first several hundred pages it wears thin. And then the illusion breaks down further when two of the characters break into a thinly-veiled Socratic dialogue, for the purpose of going through even more of the same dogmatism all over again. Ayn Rand just couldn't pull off, conceptually, the whole \\"ideas with legs\\" thing.

B0000026CN|5.0|I know for a fact that this c.d is actually one of Carlos's own favourites because he admitted this in an interview back a few years ago on &quot;Jazzf.m&quot; ..The title track has personal connections since it was written for his son, Salvador, and the intensely beautiful track called &quot;Bella&quot; was written for his daughter. ( i would certainly say that in my opinion this track is the most emotional song ever written by Carlos!!)<BR> In his interview on the radio station he stated that along with his daughter this song was also written with Wes Montgomery and Otis Rush in mind.<BR>  I bought it just for this track but was pleasantly surprised to<BR> hear that infact all the tracks are worthy of note.
B00003CWN3|5.0|This is one of the most powerful movies released in 1999.  &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; is an educator about the realities of living  transgendered.  The fears, confusion, and love affairs are accurate.  Parts of this movie may be disturbing, but it's necessary to inform the audience of what happened.  Hilary Swank performs delightfully in the role of Brandon Teena, deserving her the Oscar for Best Actress.  The writers also dig deep into body shape securities.  Chloe Sevigny expresses this greatly in her Oscar nominated role as Lana, Teena's girlfriend.  Lana proves that there are people who accept transgender lifestyle.  <br />Many movies about homosexuality are released, but not many about transgenders are released.  Therefore, the producers, director, and writers were under further pressure trying to give it extra quality.  They did everything right.  Those who are offended by such issues must get over it and watch this movie.  This is guaranteed to touch everyone's heart.  Why didn't &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; receive more Oscar nominations?  Who knows.
0385504209|4.0|It managed to hold my attention to the end, though I got tired of excessive detail in some scenes and other perceived literary sins that I suppose others think to be particulary admirable strengths, opinions varying as they do. As a novel this is a very good book, the author has a rabbit in the hat and produces it at the right time and in a manner calculated to thrill the reader. He certainly had me fooled. Very entertaining book, no doubt about that.<br />However: as a source for symbolic anecdotes and occult lore, it is not a very good book, caveat emptor. Before quoting the great revelations herein as &quot;facts&quot; make sure that you check them through multiple sources on the web or in a reference library if you have one handy.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|I highly suggest this title for any real movie fan. If you enjoy such titles such as the Godfather Series, Goodfellas, Menace II Society, Pulp Fiction, or Reservoir Dogs, then you should add this great classic to your library. This was the movie that was made for Al Pacino, as no other actor could have played the part better. This is my favorite and I recommend it and show it to everybody that comes my way. I highly suggest this movie to anyone except close minded people and children.  If you're mature enough to handle this movie, you will flash it at your house like all the rappers and big shots. Buy it now.
B00005OM4N|4.0|OK, I admit it- I love this album!  Britney's voice isn't great, and I can't stand her personally, but her music is extremely catchy!    1. I'm a Slave 4 U- I'm not a fan of this song.  It's very suggestive and boring.  The words aren't very well written, the tune is mediocre at best, and over all I'm not glad it was a single. 2/5    2. Overprotected-This is one of my favorite songs on the album.  It's really catchy, and the words are good.  Britney doesn't sound bad in this one, on the chorus. 5/5    3. Lonely- This is my favorite song on the album.  While her voice isn't great on this song, the tune is really angsty, as are the words.  It's my kind of song. 5/5    4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet a Woman- A great ballad, with some of her best words.  It's meaningful and good. 4/5    5. Boys- This song and \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" are pretty much the same.  They should have just taken one off the album, it would be no different. 2/5    6. Anticipate- This song is kind of disco.  It has a feel- good, upbeat tune, and is fun to dance to.  The words are kind of stupid, but it's a good song. 4.5/5    7. I Love Rock 'N' Roll- While this version can't compare to the rockin' version of Joan Jett, this really isn't a bad cover.  Much better than her horrible attempt at the Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\".  5/5    8. Cinderella- I love this song.  It's great!  The tune is catchy and the words are awesome.  It's a different kind of song for Britney. 5/5    9. Let Me Be- This song showcases Britney's vocals well.  It has an oriental kind of sound- I like it! 4/5    10. Bombastic Love- An OK song, with sort of a suspenseful tone. Kind of spooky if you think about it.  This is one of my least favorites, but I still kind of like it. 3/5    11. That's Where You Take Me- Like another reviewer said, this reminds me of \\"The Two Of Us\\" by NSYNC.  It has that similar tune.  Very good. 4/5    12. What It's Like To Be Me- A great song, meaningful, and cool tune.  Just please, turn of the J. Timberlake!  He has a worse voice than most! 5/5    I'm not going to buy In The Zone, but this Britney CD does well in my collection (though I must say, I do love Toxic!)
0151006903|5.0|Before you decide if you want to read Baudolino, remember whether you liked Candide or not.  If you did, this book will be fun.  If you know very much about medieval history, as well, then this book will be a must!<br />If you did not like Candide, you will probably hate Baudolino.<br />One of the central tenets of medieval society was loyalty owed to those to whom one was tied by fealty or by custom.  Baudolino was a northern Italian peasant, and owed loyalty only to the knights and lords with rights over his father's land.  Then, an event intervenes and he becomes bound to Frederick Barbarossa (red beard) who becomes the first Holy Roman Emperor.  Baudolino's tale explores that medieval loyalty as a theme in the same exaggerated way that Voltarie used Candide to explore optimism.<br />While spending time with Niketas Choniates, a high court official in Constantinople, as they flee together from the knights of the Fourth Crusade, Baudolino recounts the Candide-like story of his life from the time he met Frederick.<br />In the process, the favorite themes of the Middle Ages are all considered including chivalry, romantic love, lust, marriage, the crusades, the relationship between church and state, the rise of the city, clerical practices, religious beliefs, religious relics, traitorous behavior, fascination with heretical beliefs, imaginary animals, magic, alchemy and the Crusades.  Each subject is done in a satirical way that reveals a cynical view of how people could (and probably did) turn each matter to practical personal benefit.<br />Not satisfied with that lampooning accomplishment, Mr. Eco also draws on the styles of Dante, Cervantes, and Swift while making indirect references to their work.  For example, you will be amused as Baudolino falls hopelessly in love with the unattainable Beatrice, who in this case is the emperor's wife.  In a humorous reference to Candide, Baudolino steals a kiss . . . and has to remove himself from her presence after that.<br />Within the context of the story, the main historical events are  real.  Baudolino, like the egotist in us all, builds his tale so that he is the key actor in every event.  As they say, success has a thousand fathers while failure has none.  The satires on human venality and foibles are unrelenting and almost cynical.  I think some would be offended by the fun poked at their own religions here. . . until they realize that Baudolino takes on almost all religions of the time in one place or another in the book.<br />One of Baudolino's key approaches to solving problems is to manufacture false manuscripts, relics and other evidence that suit his purposes.  Despite this, it is a testament to his commitment to Frederick that he takes himself to pursue the mythical Prester John to deliver a false relic that Baudolino helped produce.<br />For those who are fans of The Name of the Rose, Mr. Eco even includes a locked room mystery that will keep you guessing until the last pages of the book.<br />I was bowled away by the imagination and ingenuity of the story and the many satirical directions it takes.  I would be very surprised if I read a better satire in the next ten years.<br />After you finish this book, I suggest that you think about where you have put loyalty above the truth.  How would someone else see your actions?  Would you redo those actions now, if you could?.  <br />Within the context of the story, the main historical events are     real.

B000089A07|2.0|The less said about the book, largely irrelevant here, the better: this is a movie for lovers of 'movie magic', that quality slathered onto every feeble, retreaded storyline that professional screenwriters can cobble together for big budget moviemakers.  It surely isn't a film for readers,or people who pay close attention to plot, character, or dialogue.  Hannibal Lecter's admirers are tossed a few more bones than the former version, a well-crafted but limited effort, gave them to gnaw on.  Tally and Ratner should have spared themselves the trouble, because the movie's edgy qualities are its worst ones.<br />The actors are all known for better work in better movies, and it is tempting to give them extra credit here for their earlier work, but it is unfortunately impossible to do so. Especially somnolent is Edward Norton, who brings little to the role of the psychologically complex investigator, Will (Thomas Harris took English -lo!- many years ago.) Ralph Fiennes is better looking than Tom Noonan, but that doesn't really work in his, or the movie's, favor in this version.  By this standard, Stacy Keach should be pounding the walls in a bughouse, instead of continuing his career as an actor. Hoffman appears in a small role, but once you've seen one flaming corpse scoot by in a wheelchair, you return to the spectacle a bit jaded.  The most sympathy, aside from the similarly beset Fiennes, goes to Emily Watson, who is given some of the most uproarious dialogue I have heard in some time.  After Watson/Fiennes' big love scene at the end, I gave in helplessly to the impulse to laugh out loud, cracking up the apparently relieved house at the cinema where I went to see it.  After that, the laughter recurred at each preposterous line. (It had been hard to suppress the urge up to that point, but I tried to remain considerate.) Maybe the director thought the script was pushing the envelope by being purposely hokey.  But, sorry, the yucks were more derisive than meta-entertained, and I dare the admirers of this version to sit through it pokerfaced on a return trip.  As Oscar Wilde once said, it would take a heart of stone.  Maybe the idea was to continue in the comic, and increasingly silly, direction of Hannibal, which was also an awful book. Please, let it be the last, although I have heard some frightening rumors of more to come, untouched by an editor, as author Harris specifies.<br />If this isn't an exploitation film, what is? I would happily watch Manhunter again, or Silence of the Lambs, but the franchise is now clearly in decline.  Genre lovers will feast away on this stuff until the long-awaited Albert Fish biopic emerges.
0060536357|4.0|Burrough and Helyar are two former Wall Street Journal reporters who present a comprehensive telling of the battle for control of RJR Nabisco, ultimately won by KKR, led by Henry Kravis in 1988.  The book was written in 1990 and provided the final chapter on the LBO excesses of the 1980's. By 1990, the stock market rally had made LBO's less attractive and some of the earlier deals were already starting to unravel and collapse under the weight of the debt payments, as predicted by long-time junk bond critic and rival RJR Nabisco bidder Ted Forstmann.<br />There are some criticisms of this book. The authors, despite their finanical backgrounds, seem to prefer story-telling to financial details. Hence, they have written a tale of personalities, with an especial interest in Ross Johnson and Henry Kravis, to the detriment of really explaining the financial and business details. The reader can learn intricate details about Johnson and the Wall Streeters preferences in cars, apartments, drinks, wives, schoos, etc.  The authors seem to think we need a biographic account of all minor players, starting with their grade-school years, and the end result is 528 pages and still minimal financial explanation.<br />The other main criticism here, reading this now, is how dated the material has become.  The authors would do well to provide some new material on how the deal has worked out.  From other sources, I learned that KKR renegotiated the deal in the early 1990's (the resets were nearly toxic after all) and sold out their position entirely in 1995, more or less breaking even, depending on whose numbers you use.<br />The story of the final bids and the final final bids is truly riveting and meticulously researched here. The Johnson group ultimately presents a bid that is slightly higher than the KKR bid, but the board discounts the Johnson bid since it does not guarantee the bond pricing, and calls the whole thing a tie, much like the 2000 election. At that point, the Board accepts the KKR bid, for non-economic reasons, mostly bad publicity related to Johnson's greed. Ironically, Johnson had already given up much of his payout in order to boost the total value of the bid to the shareholders.ccepts the KKR bid, for non-economic reasons, mostly bad publicity related to Johnson's greed.

B000002B35|5.0|I risk admission of how new a Floyd fan I am...but this was my first album, bought when it very first came out. It was through this album that I actually got to know the band. I still see it as a very enjoyable album, even in light of the large collection of studio albums that I now own. In fact, I even believe there are certain cuts on PULSE that are far superior to the studio versions. <br />Believe it or not, I actually found that the studio album of Dark Side of the Moon paled in certain places to this, in terms of sound quality! I much prefer the effect of the guitar and drums thundering through the stadium at the beginning of \\"Time\\"--this resonant, rich sound gives it a certain air of...magnitude...like the beginning of Creation, for lack of a better metaphor.<br />While I would say that on \\"Great Gig\\" Clare Torry's original singing is probably better--I don't think there's anything at all lost by the choice of the three background singers who take up her role. Also, Mr. Wright does not stick note-for-note with the original; he improvises where possible. The other real standout track from DSotM is \\"Any Colour You Like\\"...for some reason, there is just something so entrancing about that synth solo.<br />Another song that benefits from the stadium performance is \\"Learning to Fly\\". Somehow, it really takes on that spacey sound that it ought to have had in the studio album; one can really imagine speeding down the runway and suddenly lifting into flight. A switch that I believe was made that made the most dramatic moment of the song twice as effective: I cannot tell for sure, but it almost seems as if that dinky prop plane was replaced with a massive jumbo jet. This is also a case where that reverberating stadium sound really transports the listener \\"above the planet on a wing and a prayer\\". The studio album doesn't even come close.<br />The one mistake, however (despite the fact that I love it to death!) is in \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\". I only call it a mistake in retrospect, now that I am familiar with Wish You Were Here. Somehow, as I was not familiar with the story of Mr. Barrett or WYWH, I took this for an uplifting, inspiring piece. Though  musically very beautiful and I will always love it, I have to say that leaving out the \\"darker\\" parts of the song rather interferes with its mood--even causing a new fan to miss the point.<br />Of course, beyond doubt the most powerful performance is \\"Comfortably Numb\\". This surpasses the studio original by so much that it is almost beyond explanation; however, I will attempt it! It is in this song that you can truly see just how stifled the musicians (Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Wright in particular) were during the production of the studio original...because it is incredible what gets free in the live setting!<br />Much of what I write here will be a sort of reverse reaction--I actually reacted adversely when I heard the studio original, after being used to this one--I simply could not stand it! The thing felt wrong from so many angles. Almost immediately, the first thing that separates PULSE from the studio original is the slowed tempo--this creates a swaying feeling...as though things really are coming through in waves that push the \\"numb\\" listener back and forth...a feeling that was very much lacking in the less expressive studio version. Also, the guitar throughout the whole song (not just the famous solo) is far more passionately played--and in the second solo, there is even a screaming noise that sounds as if it could be all of the agony that Pink held inside until then.<br />The sound itself is very flowing, so rich that it is almost tangible, lifted upwards by the beautiful synth playing of Richard Wright. Without knowing a thing about the circumstances of the breakup, this is something I immediately noted in the studio album as a hollow absence...as though the music had been forcibly sucked dry. But how wonderfully things changed, in the creation of this new Floyd fan seven years ago. It is none other than Mr. Wright himself that takes over for the now absent Roger Waters. He really takes well to the role, and his enthusiasm shows clearly in the musical result.<br />Forever it will be his haunting, ethereal sounding voice that I associate with the \\"doctor\\" in \\"Comfortably Numb\\". Mr. Wright can pull off an incredibly spooky effect when he wants to--you can almost imagine the nearly walled-in Pink hearing this voice coming through as though from another plane, one in which he no longer fully functions.  This, and the incredible musical power of this song, both in the guitar solo and in Mr. Wright's contribution, make this easily the best version of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" in existence.<br />All in all, this is probably the Floyd's best concert album.
B00008CLOA|2.0|I don't care for this remaster at all. I wanted to replace my scratched up Mobile Fidelity version and was greeted with a nightmare. Now fellow Floydians don't take this the wrong way. I like Pink Floyd as much or more than the next guy, but this disk was such a pain. First as some have stated the sound is very different from the Mobile Fidelity disc. The 5.1 almost detracts from the music, as everything is far less concentrated.<BR>It's hard hearing Nick's drums from the left, David's guitar from the right, and Roger singing in back. Also I couldn't get the thing to play in a normal CD player, even though it suposedly can. After hearing Speak to me through Time I promplty exchanged it for the '92 remaster which sounds a heck of a lot better and more like the my old Mobile Fidelity.<br />I hope this clears up some of the mystery about this disc.<br />- Wolfgang Frost
B000002A3T|5.0|I think that The Division Bell is among Pink Floyd's best works.  Yes, it is different from their prior works, but that's to be expected.  Seen for what it IS--the best work that David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason have produce--it is truly an excellent album.  Although not as lyrically unified as albums like The Wall, Pink Floyd managed what so few bands have been able to do after losing an important member: preserved their *sound* intact and yet adapting to the times.  Chicago couldn't do it, the Moody Blues couldn't do it--but thanks to its talented remaining members, Pink Floyd succeeded.<br />In my mind, The Division Bell actually bears an interesting similarity to Mr. Wright's first solo album, Wet Dream, and if you like one, I think chances are fairly good that you will like the other. Both albums have that sort of laid-back, open, oceanic and dreamlike feel to them in many places. This is certainly not the angst-filled Animals, though there are points where the \\"cast members\\" reveal they're feeling low.<br />Like no other album after Wish You Were Here, Mr. Wright's presence can REALLY be heard and felt. It almost defies words, but there is always a strong sense of PLACE in his music. \\"Cluster One\\", for me, might be a cool fall day (the crackling sounds could be, for instance, fallen leaves swirling about). I can almost feel the wind shift direction at the change of a chord, see the bright blue sky and perhaps a few gentle wisps of cirrus clouds.<br />\\"Marooned\\", of course, is VERY oceanic. The image in my mind has always been of a stark, rocky, New England coastline--dark, ominous clouds threaten a nor'easter that may or may not materialise...but a warning just the same. Mr. Gilmour deserves credit here as well, for a guitar solo that to me sounds like the anguish of a soul in pain. Some parts even seem like racking sobs. Yet as the song goes on, it almost seems to gather strength...all hope is not gone. Out of this pain comes renewal.<br />That brings me to the album's most powerful track: \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\": one of the most moving, most personal things I have ever heard (Mr. Wright's second solo album Broken China being THE most moving thing I've ever heard).<br />I would prefer not to discuss the actual circumstances, but the time at which I purchased this album was the darkest, most painful time in my life. I cannot explain what it was like to hear this song--almost like seeing a reflection of myself, for lack of better words.  It is a compliment to Mr. Wright that his music would draw me in like that. I know the lyrics are not his, but the sentiments certainly seem to belong to him.<br />The song offered something else, too. For all the darkness, there is a very distinct turning point, when that \\"trumpet\\" synthesiser kicks in: \\"I'm creeping back to life...\\" The darkness, as terrible and consuming as it was, need not be permanent. And even though at the end, this soul is still in some pain--there is hope. In the final chord is an uplifting message...this bleeding heart may not be beating much...but it is slow, strong, and clear at the end. There is still life. Whatever his circumstances were, it was very brave of Mr. Wright to capture his feelings in music that way, because it truly is a gift when you can take those things and touch someone else.<br />I think \\"Coming Back to Life\\" is notable for Mr. Gilmour's second-most impressive singing job. Only \\"So Far Away\\" from his self-named solo album outdoes it. The beautiful, even, rapid note changes are absolutely impressive...the studio effects chosen here are very effective, in my opinion, to accentuate it.<br />The last song, \\"High Hopes\\", is beautifully haunting--the ringing of the Division Bell has a rather mournful, tolling sound to it that fits well with the reminisces upon things long gone. There is a beautiful solo and ascending chord sequence at the end. Though it seems all is lost to time, there are still \\"high hopes\\" at the end of The Division Bell, giving it an overall optimistic feel.<br />I think there is more to this album than meets the eye. I was, overall, pleased with The Division Bell, especially because of a jewel like \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\"--far and away the best song on the album. It is the sign of a true artist when you can see parts of your own circumstances in their work.

B00003CXXS|4.0|JURASSIC PARK - 1, was larger than life; larger than anything else that had came out of Hollywood, larger than anything that Spielberg had done before. The concept was fresh, the dinosaurs were scary, the backdrop was unimaginably awesome, and the direction, impeccable. Justifiably, it turned out to be one of the best movies ever, with a huge cult following. It was only natural that it had to be followed up by a sequel, which turned out to be a great disappointment, alas! With the high expectations raised by the first part, in an attempt to live upto the high expectations, in THE LOST WORLD, Spielberg, it seems, tried a bit too hard, making a mess of the movie altogether, making it much too long, much too boring.<br />However, JURASSIC PARK - 3, is surprisingly much better than THE LOST WORLD, especially, since, it isn't directed by Spielberg.  OK, so it has the same dinosaurs, and has them chasing around and killing the humans, who repeatedly happen to drop themselves by amongst the dinosaurs, for some strange reason or the other. Well, if THE LOST WORLD was solely about dinosaurs chasing around humans, with a very sorry ending giving out the message \\"don't mess with nature\\", this one however, has dinosaurs chasing around humans, but with the feel of a fast-paced action movie! In JURASSIC PARK - 3, the director doesn't try to complicate things by trying to bring the dinosaurs to the city and try to make a GODZILLA and a JURASSIC PARK at the same time, but concentrates wholly on the action taking place within the island itself. The movie is incredibly short, and is action-packed, with dinosaurs popping out from every corner of the screen, without a moment of respite; and before you know, the movie ends.<br />Unlike THE LOST WORLD, the straightforwardness of JURASSIC PARK - 3 is what makes it a highly viewable movie. There are however, certain things, which this movie could have carried on from THE LOST WORLD, like JEFF GOLDBLUM, and his sarcasms, reeking with pessimism.  The movie is packed with action from the first scene to the last, without trying too hard to be intelligent. Since it doesn't try to achieve much, but only try to entertain, it is short, and makes the viewer want for more.
B000002MTR|3.0|This is not one of Red Hot Chili Peppers best CDs. All of their songs just seem like a big blur.  Preview some of the songs before you buy this to make sure you know what you're buying.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Disney's most classic movie is brought to high quality DVD. There is one BIG difference from the VHS version-i was very amazed. Highly reccommend for everyone of all ages-how could anyone not own this master piece. The magical creatures are brought to life, for once it amazes adults more than the children. This is am must have DVD for all collections. 11 stars!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is the best ever Red Hot Chili Pepper CD! Every single song is great! My favorites are 1. Around the World, 3. Scar Tissue, and 6. Californication! This CD is so refreshing after their last albums which were much more funk. You have to get this CD if you have ever liked any Red Hot Chili Pepper songs.
B00009V7RF|1.0|I really like the BEPs and loved their first two albums.  I caught them live once and really liked their different sound -- especially the inclusion of horns.  And I've been eagerly awaiting this album.<BR>That said, this album was painful to listen to.  To me it sounds like typical generic hip hop, with lyrics about women and women's bodies and other unoriginal ideas.  No clever rhymes, and \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" is simply one of the most offensive titles I've ever heard.<BR>Poor judgment in including a new fourth member can be forgiven, but pandering to the lowest common denominator in order to fit in cannot.  I am no longer a fan.
B00008MNYS|5.0|He is certainly the most sexy guy on earth and and mega super star in Germany anyway so I might be a *little* biased, but the album IS great. Of course, it doesn't reach its predecessor \\"Sing when you're winning\\" which would get 6 stars out of 5 but it is great nonetheless. <br />Highlight are FEEL (great video clip, btw) as well as the other single releases COME UNDONE and SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL, and ME AND MY MONKEY. The best song of the album (and ever, I'd even say) is LOVE SOMEBODY - this is so epic... <br />Which is a little sad, however, is that the American version is different from the European version. HOT FUDGE is definitely missing on this album. But your bonus track are not bad  either :-D<BR><br /> So please, do buy this album, I swear you won't regret it! And if you EVER have the chance to see this guy in concert, do it before he's really really big in the US and you will have to wait 15 hours just to be in the 1st row at a 70000 people concert... He is such a great entertainer!!! Luv ya Robbie!!

B00000FCBC|4.0|For those who like a wide variety of rock and metal, hearing Metallica take on some of their favorite bands is a big treat.<br />The division of the 2 discs is pretty clear - Disc 1 has recently recorded covers that will appeal more to the Load/Reload crowd, while Disc 2 has some of Metallica's classic metal covers collected for the first time.  While many older fans might have the majority of Disc 2's tracks on one obscure bootleg or another, new and old fans alike can enjoy most of Disc 1's selections.  The tracks tend to run hot and cold, but the good news is that there is far more good than bad.  Standout tracks like &quot;Turn The Page&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Helpless&quot; have quickly become concert favorites.  The only really substandard tracks are the Discharge covers, which pretty much consist of a decent riff with James screaming the title of the song over and over.<br />All in all, you get alot of bang for your buck.  Recommended for any rock or metal fan.
B000002JST|5.0|Great Cd. Right up there with highway and Powerage.
B00006JDS4|2.0|This is not a pullpit. This is not a soundoff for people with issues telling me to be horrified for being a part of the male species that commits the crimes depicted in this movie. Yes, sadly, some poor maligned soul actually wrote as much in one of the reviews here. This is a review of a horror movie. On to the review then shall we?<BR>This is a somewhat disturbing film in that rape, for most, is a disturbing subject. As a graphic,. bloody horror movie, its pretty ordinary. The personal violence inflicted upon the main character, however, elevates the terror. A female writer decides to finish a book in a secluded cottage. Only its not so secluded. Close by is a small town inhabited by a bunch of red neck good old boys. They decide to savage the woman one day while she enjoys some time out boating. The scenes that follow are overly long and graphic. I'm sure the audience could have got the message with shorter and less revealing clips. Alas, the makers of this wanted to deliberatly create a stir. And so they have. They leave the woman for dead but she comes back and plots her revenge. The kill scenes are pretty lame. Nothing to creative here. A hanging. A stabbing. Creative use of boat propellers. but not enough of the red stuff. The killings are implied more than shown. Sometimes this works. In a movie like this, it doesnt. This is the kind of film that should run red in rivers. The movie spends to much time on the sodomy of the woman and doesnt know if its a horror pic or a drama. It tries to be both and fails.

His real persona is agonizingly revealed as each of his masks are torn from his face and subsequently, his soul.<br />In the beginning chapters, Frey holds tight to his dreams of getting high. Since the age of 10 his mind has been in altered states. His rage was the guiding beacon to alcohol, drugs and trouble.

There is one scene in a dentist's office that is forever burned into my psyche. I still cringe. His descriptions of his fellow patients are raw and real. Using a verbal scalpel, James<BR>filets everyone into raw meat including himself. Then he goes one step further and reveals the person behind the pretense. <br />He writes without apology or frosting. He writes from the soul. I will remember him.

6304712936|5.0|This film is the best underpublisized film of all time. Being only 16 years old I am not able to refer to myself as an expert, but I am capable of knowing a great movie when I see it. Everything about this film from its perspective right down to the facial expressions of the narrator intertwined with the heart wrenching notes that strum upon our very emotions. I'm anything but an expert on classical music, being a teenager my ears are more acustomed to the distortion of nirvana. However the music in this movie sparked a new found interest in the genre. Not enough can be said about this movie. The overall progression of Mozart's insanity throughtout the movie which if fueled by his own demons, alcohol, and the haunting apparition of his father. No one can be exactly sure on the details of Mozart's life, however I feel the director helps to portray his personality in a way that is fitting to the story line. Overall this movie is worth every penny and could quite possibly influence your life. The fashion in which he is presented creates an aura around the not so perfect personality of mistique and intelligence.

0393057658|5.0|This was an excellent read.  Once again, Lewis delivers an entertaining look at a what would likely be considered a dry subject, even by the standards of many baseball fans. However, in writing this book he has popularized a new way of looking the game, both in how it is measured and played.  Can it be long before all teams begin to apply this system of statistical analysis to make their draft, trade and lineup decisions?  If an average quality utility infielder can walk one out of every five at bats, hit .260 and earn $10 million a year, does this make ARod and Giambi worth $30 or $40 million a year?<br />In the end I'm not sure who to be rooting for - the clever general managers and their \\"savant quants\\" or the players previously considered too hapless and hopeless even to ride the bench for a big league team, who will soon, undoubtedly, be capable of earning salaries that might make ARod blush.  Okay, so maybe that is an exaggeration.  But clearly the proliferation of this way of thinking and the mad pursuit of \\"walkers\\", \\"clay pigeons\\" and club foot pitchers that will surely ensue, will elevate the financial stakes of a crop of players that a few years ago wouldn't have been able to play for Bill Veeck's St. Louis Browns.  <br />So the secret is out.  Draft the lame, the blind, even the toe-tagged as long as they can find an endless string of uninteresting ways to get on base.  While this efficient approach clearly yields results that can't be disputed, it diminishes certain elements of the game that add excitement and ultimately nostalgia for many fans.  The mystique of the underdog emerging triumphant over the Goliaths of the league will only last until the the current Davids, like the A's, become a smarter version of Goliath.  Then it will be just as boring and predictable to see these teams win, even if they can do it with a smaller payroll.<br />The financial fortunes of the game notwithstanding, this book is a great read for anybody who is interested in innovative and unconventional methods of problem solving.

6305350205|4.0|Everyone seems to like to dog this movie, but I actually think it's pretty good. Just like II, V has the feel of an episode from the original series. For those who don't know, this movie, much like Wrath of Kahn, is derived from an original series episode. The episode that it derives the story from is &quot;The Way to Eden&quot;, arguably one of the worst of the original series. However, unlike the original episode, this version actually has some direction and quality. You may not like this one the first time through, but watch it again a few more times and you'll probably start to like it. Sure, the plot is a little far fetched, but hey it's a science fiction movie. Let your imagination do the driving the movie will be much more enjoyable.

B000002MTR|4.0|I don´t know why,  but I tend to like the least liked albums or songs of some bands.  If you don´t own this album and you are a fan of thier new stuff,  I´m pretty sure you won´t like this album.  I really enjoyed it when I got it, though.  I liked the direction The RHCP took on this album, and in a way it was led by one of my favorite guitarists,  Dave Navarro.  His style just changed the whole band,  something that the band maybe wasn´t ready for. <br />This album contains thier darkest and most alternative rock song to date (correct me if I´m wrong,  I haven´t heard all thier new stuff) and that song is Warped,  a great opener.  Doesn´t set the tone for the rest of the album,  but stands great alone as one of my favorites from the band.  My favorite on the album though,  and one of my favorites from the 90s is Aeroplane.  That is my favorite song from this group and it has a lot to do with Dave Navarro´s guitar playing.  I liked the chemistry in the band when he was in it and kinda wished for one more like it,  but I guess there is only one black sheep album in this band and it is the one that I enjoyed the most.
B000002U8G|5.0|I may be in a minority when I say: as good as \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" and the other albums that followed were, it was the material that Floyd made before that major juggernaut of an album which rings the more special to me. I really think that when \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" was made and released, Floyd gained something spectacular with it, particularly in their intelligent, profound lyrical concepts, and they obviously had won a larger following than they ever would have anticipated. However, I also believe that they lost something just as big, if not even bigger in the process. They seemed to lose their whimsical edge, as well as their uncompromising and superfluous ethereality. They just seemed to lose a bit of their natural 'flow' and intensity in their creativity, mostly found in their psychedelic and minimalist experiments, and as a result, I mostly view their creativity & progression on a musical (excluding lyrical) level as something which slipped down into drier areas. There are pros and cons with everything, and anytime you gain something in progress, more than likely something will be lost as a result of that - for better or for worse. But, other than that, I say all of this because I'm a bit worn out of DSOTM and it's other popular successors, and feel that everything from their '67-'72 period deserves a bit more recognition, especially when people (mostly of this generation) say they're Floyd fans, and the sum total of their knowledge of Floyd is no more than DSOTM, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and/or \\"The Wall.\\"<br />Which brings us to 1971's _Meddle_, the second to last album before the \\"big one\\" was released. This is the pre-DSOTM album which possibly shows Floyd at their most polished and refined in execution and production, and when hearing this album, and coming to that conclusion, you would think this was the very last album released before DSOTM. But, that isn't the case. Also, the refinement, the trimming of minimalist experiments, added with the fact that many of the tracks on here are not extended helps to make this arguably the most accessible album in the pre-DSOTM period. But, this isn't to say that _Meddle_ lacks any kind of surreal, psychedelic atmospheres, as those can clearly be found here as well, but in controlled proportions. \\"One of These Days\\" is a definite rocker: sort of the antithesis of the lengthy, drawn-out Floyd we all know. Roger Waters' driving basslines and Rick Wright's calling synth lines are the standouts, which are somewhat overshadowed later on by David Gilmour's screechy guitar lines, while Nick Mason keeps a steady, but no less menacing drum beat. \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" is definitely my personal favorite track on the album. An ethereal, wispy, breezy, mellow track, David Gilmour's calm, soothing voice, the gentle acoustic arpeggios, and other such subtleties help to create a dreamy, tranquil atmosphere of the mind and soul, which can be comparable to experiencing a gentle breeze on a summer morning, while calmly reflecting on pleasant memories or wishes.<br />Elsewhere, \\"Fearless\\" is a mid-tempo track featuring David Gilmour playing an ascending diatonic lick based in G major, which gives a slight symphonic atmosphere to an otherwise summery track, and \\"San Tropez\\" is a short, playful, elegant jazz-tinged track, with Roger Waters on lead vocals. It's quite interesting hearing Roger in a more playful mood, as opposed to the morbid tendencies found in the majority of his later writings. \\"Seamus\\" features dogs barking in the background to an otherwise bluesy track, and \\"Echoes\\" is the 23-minute head-trip of the album. Ethereal, melodic and airy in the beginning, until that long, creepy \\"echo\\" section comes in. Can't really explain it all - needs to be heard. The vocal rhythmics and rhythms in general call to mind \\"Breathe\\" and the ending of \\"Time\\" from the following album after the following album, DSOTM.<br />If you're reading this, and are a Pink Floyd fan, and you haven't heard anything before _Dark Side of The Moon_, please do yourself a favor and start exploring that era of the band. You'd really be doing yourself an injustice if you don't. _Meddle_ would be a great place to start.before _Dark Side of The Moon_, please do yourself a favor and start exploring that era of the band.

B000053VAF|2.0|So, I saw this movie last year and was unimpressed; I was surprised because I expected to like it, having heard that it was a funny, intelligent movie.  Today I decided to give it another chance and watch it again.  I still didn't find it to be a very inspiring or entertaining film.<br />I noticed that the reviewers who said things like \\"This movie really made me THINK, man!\\" didn't mention what it made them think about.  My theory about this film is that people see it and, rather than admit that they don't get it and risk sounding foolish, they act like there's this really profound message hidden there that they understand.  I am here to tell you that there's really nothing to get.  It's a very superficial movie.  The emperor wears no clothes.<br />\\"Dogma\\", aside from a few chuckles and some talented actors (I have no idea what lured them), was intellectually empty.  It left me cold.  Okay, Catholicism is antiquated, people are losing faith in religion and becoming disinterested in churches, and organized religion contains more than its fair share of hypocrisies.  Oh yeah, and we are a culture of brain-dead TV-o-philes who know nothing of history.  Yadda yadda yadda.  And the point?<br />I don't feel that any conclusions or solutions were made at the end of the film...I didn't get what Kevin Smith's big picture was supposed to be.  The story had some references to historical characters (Azrael, the angel of death), but then had some other people who had names of famous historical characters for no apparent significance (i.e.:Bartleby is a character from a Melville novel about the tediousness of working; no relevance to character in movie), which was irritating.  I guess I was trying to read between the lines to find some hidden meaning where there was none.  When a movie is labeled as inventive, it generally means it's multi-layered, which Dogma is not.<br />George Carlin as a cheesy modern priest made for some limited chuckles. Jason Lee was a fascinating-to-watchAzrael.  Salma Hayek had great energy and sex appeal.  Jay and Bob were as boring as cement.  Chris Rock was spritely and funny as the \\"13th apostle\\" (funny gimmick there).  Linda Fiorentino was at her absolute worst.  She pretty much rolled her eyes and smiled sarcastically through the entire movie.  Yawn.  Janeane Garafolo had a cameo and would have been better in the lead.  The casting of Alannis Morrissette as God and the whole ridiculous ending scene with her capering about like a lobotomized flower child was unintentionally hilarious.<br />I did enjoy Kevin Smith's other movies.  I suppose if you're a big fan of his you'll want to see this.  But I'm willing to point out the emperor's underwear.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|There are so many good things to say about \\"Donnie Darko\\" that this review could be pages long. But, first of all and most important, this is a very original, thought-provoking and intense film.<br />The script is like something Neal Stephenson and Stephen King would write togheter: dark, multi-elemented, fantastic characters, it grabs the viewer and tranports him to Donnie's reality without effort. Maybe you won't turn the TV set off feeling very well after watching \\"Donnie Darko\\", but you also won't forget it easily. Donnie sticks to mind. Relating things like depressive behavior with time-travel made this movie one of the most incredible I've seen in the last decade.<br />Donnie is brilliantly played by one of the upcoming stars of the young generation of talented actors, Jake Gylenhaal. Donnie is a schyzophrenic, uncomprehended kid with lots of relationship problems. Sleepwalking, he does \\"errands\\" for a fantastic figure, a giant reptile-rabbit named Frank. These errands, always using violence and being supposedly pointless, are all part of a greater scheme conceived by Donnie and his immaginary pal, Frank. And this greater scheme is what is most interesting and original about \\"Donnie Darko\\". I don't want to give anything away, you'll have to watch it to understand.<br />All characters are well-developed, no matter how little their on-screen time. For example: Noah Wyle's character, one of Donnie's teachers, is always eating someting, because the actor decided his character was diabetic (!). This is the kind of acting I'm talking about. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and, especially, Jena Malone, all of them created believable and coherent characters.<br />But the best thing of all in this amazing movie is the dialogue. It's intelligent, fast, funny. There are many, many memorable quotes, one better than the other. Log on to the Message Board pages about \\"Donnie Darko\\" at Imdb.com to see what I mean.<br />Watch it over and over again, pay attention to details, characters, situations and dialogues.

B0000042H4|5.0|This set of Ring is simply magnificent. To give it one star is ridiculous. I would just ignore those particular reviewers who bash up the recording because they simply has no judgement. When this recording was issued it won practically every award  from every country. When you listen to it you will understand why. One may argue that Furtwangler is a better interpreter or Knappertsbusch is a better interpreter. But let me say this - while I think their interpretation is valid and fabulous, the sound quality cannot compare with this Solti. Why would you want to torture yourself listening to a 15 to 16 hour long mono recording when the Solti stereo is just as good or even better depending on your tastes?? I do value interpretation and I do listen to some mono recording simply because they are fabulous interpretations. While I would listen to Furtwangler and Knappertsbusch for their interpretation from time to time, it's a pain to listen to their mono recording all the time. So my favorite sets are the Solti and Bohm. Of these 2, the Solti has better sound quality. I prefer the Solti to the Bohm not because the Bohm is bad. It's like comparing 1 million dollars (the Solti) with $999,999.99 (the Bohm). The Solti has marvellous moments that the Bohm misses. The Bohm has marvellous moments that the Solti misses. So being a Ring freak, I buy them all!!!! But if you pin me down, I would recommend the Solti as the one set to own if you cannot own any other set. This is sad though because in a work as long and complex as the ring, the scope for interpretation is enormous and two diametrically opposite interpretations could be just as valid and just as pleasurable to listen to.<br />Let me know get to the core of the issue. Why the Solti? Put simply, the most important factor is the cast. Solti has the dream cast that everyone wants but nobody has. Strictly speaking, the Ring is so difficult to cast that it is next to impossible to get a dream cast. So even Solti's dream cast is not really a dream cast. But among all the sets, it is the closest to the dream casts of everybody's dreams - headed by the incomparable and unsurpassed Brunnhilde of Birgit Nilsson. While Kirsten Flagstad may have a bigger voice lower down the soprano range, nobody can beat Birgit Nilsson at the top (actually Leonie Rysanek could, but her voice is of a different timbre - not suitably heroic for a Warrior Valkyrie, although in terms of vocal amplitude it could be larger than Birgit Nilsson's). All the rest of the cast had years of stage experience on the Ring, and it shows in the recording - Hans Hotter, Wolfgang Windgassen, James King, Kirsten Flagstad, Gerhard Stolze, Christa Ludwig, Gustav Neidlinger, Gottlob Frick, Helga Dernesch, Grace Hoffman, Regine Crespin ........ these are all SUPERSTARS that rule the operatic world!!<br />In Stars Wars language,<br />Birgit Nilsson is the Death Star!!!<BR>Windgassen, James King, Gottlob Frick, Gustav Neidlinger, Christa Ludwig, Regine Crespin, Gerhard Stolze, Grace Hoffman are each a Super Star Destroyer!!<BR>The Vienna Philharmonic is the force that drives the music and imparts strength to the singers.

B000006TRV|5.0|this album in my opinion relates more to my generation rather then to the generation of its release time. most of the people i talk whom where alive when it was released dislike it alot saying that it is the worst of all of their albums, but i think that is because they could no longer relate to it because everyone had played this idea out already people seemed tired of war and excitement so they were looking for something completely new and original hence the 80s. the people of my generation have no problems relating to this album because we have nothing to stand up for, nothing to fight for other then ourselves and this album is the epitome of that fight.
B0000844I8|5.0|Not many films can say that they have spawned a television series. None that I can think of other than Stargate can say they've spawned a series that's lasted as long as Star Trek: The Next Generation. That's a feat in my book!<br />This film takes the viewer to Egypt where an ancient device is unearthed. The device, the Stargate, has the power to hurtle a traveler to distant parts of the universe almost instantly. A team consisting of Col. Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell), his team of soldiers, and Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist go through the gate to explore the world on the other side. They find the planet populated, and learn that not all the beings they meet are friendly.<br />The action and special effects in this film are first-rate. The actors are all excellent, and play very believable parts. Spader in particular does a very good job playing the geek. Russell, similar to his role in 'Soldier', plays a stone-cold military robot, only so because of extenuating circumstances you'll see in the film.<br />The special edition DVD is filled with extras such as deleted scenes that have been put back into the film. These scenes add to the overall experience of the film and help the viewer to understand the characters better. I particularly enjoy the 'making of' featurettes.<br />Pick this one up, it's a keeper!
B00009V7OL|4.0|The Abyss became James Cameron's lost masterpiece. The film was cut for theatrical distribution because of Cameron's contract with the studio (it stated he could have final cut if it came in under a certain time limit). Thus, a whole subplot became a buried plot.<br />This re-release of the classic two disc set has the extended version and the original theatrical version on the same disc. It also has a huge amount of extras on the second disc. The difference really comes down to the packaging; The Abyss is now in a digipak two disc set. Both the political conflict raging up above the stranded submersible oil rig and the first contact with the aliens below benefit from the enhanced screen time. While it's clear that Cameron was trying to make something of a political comment within the entertainment, it still doesn't come through as anything more than &quot;all you need is love, and if you don't find it fast we'll blow you away&quot; variety. So, perhaps we should be thankful that while the message isn't necessarily better, the entertainment sure is.<br />The performances of all the principle actors enjoy the enhanced screen time as well. Ed Harris and Michael Behn both give very different but powerful performances. In this film Behn isn't the hero but an insane wannabe hero who falls victim to his own paranoia.<br />The disc itself appears the same as the previous edition. I didn't notice any improvement in picture quality or the interactive menu. The packaging is less sturdy than the previous edition. Of all the films to re re-released as a two disc set, this film and Cast Away deserve to be presented in the two disc format. While the re-release of Planet of the Apes has oodles of extras, it's a pitiful excuse for a film. ID4 is entertaining but really doesn't deserve the extra disc space.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Buy it.  Every movie collection needs this in it.  Watch several times.  Kids love it.  I love it (Big Kid).<br />The sounds and clarity are unbelievable.  Better than at the theater since you can pause and continue.<br />The story is wonderful and gives new perspective to monsters.  My two year old loves it.
B000089RVX|4.0|I just love this cd!! It was a nice new sound and I think Amy's voice is very beautiful!A few of my fave tracks are: \\"Imaginary\\", \\"Tourniquet\\", and \\"Hello\\". Hello especially because her voice blows me away! Strangely, \\"Bring Me to Life\\" isn't the one I listen to the most even though it is what got me into Evanescence.Still an awesome song, though! If you don't have this cd yet, get it!!!!It's a great quick fix of metal and oddly, a female crooner, but nonetheless a great cd!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater as a double feature.  Disney was giving a sneak preview of its new movie Father of the Bride as the second movie.  I paid for one and got the other.<br />Both movies are classics.<br />If you own a DVD player, Get this movie.  You are going to want to watch it several times in your life and if you have children.. Several thousand more...
0782006809|4.0|I'll admit the plot of this film is dated and far-fetched. Briefly stated, Doris Day wants to preserve her virginity at all costs, even with the suave, sophisticated and handsome Cary Grant pursuing her and trying to wear down her resistance. One might ask what woman in their right mind would turn down Cary, but that's the sum total of this movie. Cary and Doris are not married in the film and in 1962 &quot;good girls&quot; like Doris didn't bed down for a one-night stand, even when the man happened to be Cary Grant. Despite the somewhat implausible plot, the movie is still a complete delight. Cary, as always, is impeccably cast in the role of the charming millionaire businessman. His comedic timing is unsurpassed. Doris Day more than holds her own and the film's funniest lines are hers. She always brings her own unique brand of charisma to any role and this is one of her best performances. Her drunken scene is hilarious and you will laugh out loud. All of the interplay between she and Grant is the stuff of classics.<br />Gig Young gives a fine supporting performance in a role initially offered to Tony Randall. Audrey Meadows is also excellent as Doris' spinster roommate. The costumes are sumptuous, the cinematography frequently breataking and the acting is exceptional. This is a fine movie and an example of screen chemistry at its best.
B000002KB8|5.0|this was sabbath's  first album and what a way to start out.from 1    to 10 everysong on this album gets a 10.ozzy's vocals on the song black sabbath is down right creepy and how about the churchbells,thunder and rain sounds to start off this track{what a cool way to start a song}the second track the wizard is started off with ozzy playing harmonica{quite strange but it works}wasp/behind the wall of sleep/bassically/n.i.b. is my favorite track on this album.geezer butlers bass solo before nib is really neat  and tony iommi's guitar playing is fanastic on n.i.b..the fourth track is wicked world another cool song.the last track is sleeping village/a bit of finger/warning.this is my second favorite track .this song has a long instrumental part between chorus where iommi shows off his great talent.this is a must  have for any fan of great music.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album is without a doubt Weezer's best album of all time, and one of my favorites. Although they're a geeky rock band, this album is full of &quot;raw&quot; rock that makes you feel good while keeping a melodic tone. Each song is unique, and none sound the same (unlike some of their other CD's). If it sounds awkward at first, listen to it again (the first time i listened to it I HATED it, but now I love it). This is a MUST HAVE for your CD collection!

630016361X|5.0|For the time period of the late 80,s,this movie was indeed a breath of freshness and tranquility to the mood and to the spirit. Why, one may ask. The simple reply to this statement is that it created a new, uptill then undiscovered mixture of sensuality and sexuality. The casting was indeed superb with Bo rendering more than what the script desired. Indeed the composition was superlative to say the least. The story was gripping with the direction and the labwork being of a far superior standard then previously seen in movies which focused on sex and the sensous part of it. I gratefully acknowledge the efforts of the producer and the whole team especially the casting director for giving us such a masterpiece in the eighties. Even now in 2003 I remember what pleasure this movie gave me. For me it is a masterpiece for all times and a must for those who induldge in quick one nightstands.===
B000002IPZ|1.0|apart from the album cover {which i must admit is really cool}and the song face in the sky {the only decent song on this album,still nothing great}there is no real reason to buy this poor excuse of a metal album.the singer is truly terrible,the worst metal vocalist i ever heard.he's voice is so bad it is almost comical.imagine i actually spent two dollars on this cd  at a used cd store.it's not even worth 1 cent.easily the worst cd i ever heard.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I am giving this 5 stars purely for the movie - the DVD is just OK.  I absolutely love the movie.  It's about a weatherman (Phil) who hates covering the Groundhog Day celebrations.  He acts like a complete jerk, and ends up having to repeat the day over and over and over.  The cast is just great (Bill Murray, Chris Elliot, Andie McDowell) and the story is unique and well-written.  The DVD is just mediocre, comes with very few special features.
B000002KDO|5.0|this was sabbath's third studio album after thier great debut self titled album and the good but somewhat overrated paranoid.every song is a classic except for the instrumentals of course.sweet leaf is a classic which still get's played on the radio.after forever shows off the song writing talent of tony iommi it's a track i never get's tired off and it's perhaps my favorite track on master of reality.children of the grave is a great all out rocker .lord of this  world is a great song with a great beat to it.solitude is a beautiful slow song that shows ozzy can not only sing hard rock tunes  but can also sing great ballats when he wants to.the album ends with the underrated into the void.this song is proberly the heaviest on the album and it's a great song.master of reality is a must have for all sabbath fans.
B00005JLEU|2.0|why is this movie so popular? i dont have the answer. it is really long, and a bunch of strange magical things keep happening one after the other including some stupid things like &quot;if you become afraid at all, they can see you!&quot;. it started so smartly but then went downhill so quickly. <br />i like animated movies and loved shrek. but this is just plain silly movie.

B00005MP58|5.0|This may very well be not only the definitive adaptation of Austen's classic book, but it just might prove to be the definitive adaptation of ANY book, ever! <BR>Never has a movie (in my mind) so wholly captured the feel, pace, atmosphere and original dialogue before. Although the film would have to be even longer than it is to include every single moment of Austen's masterpiece, one doesn't ever feel disappointed by any omissions. In fact, the ommissions seemed to improve the continuity of the film as a whole. While staying obsessively true to the original book, this movie is able to easily stand on its own as a masterpiece of acting and direction.<br />Don't be daunted by the length! I have watched this film more times than I can recall and been newly enchanted every time. Ehle and Firth's performances are masterful... the level of nuance and depth they bring to their characters creates the same kind of humanity and wit that Austen endowed them with.<br />As Elizabeth, Ehle portrays a strong-willed girl who is at once thoroughly respectable and intelligent while maintaining a sort of ahead-of-her time free-spiritedness and independence. When she refuses to cooperate with Lady Catherine, you can see a flash in her eyes that demands respect while daring opposition. <br />Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy overcomes the temptation of so many actors to merely be \\"brooding\\". The intensity of just-barely suppressed passion he brings to the role makes you see the man behind the enigma. Firth makes Darcy a real person, granted a cool, intelligent, self-possessed person, but a person capable of feeling humiliation, anger and exasperation. Some of his best scenes in the film are towards the end when he begins to let his guard down because he so desperately wants Elizabeth to notice him.<br />All of the supporting characters are impeccably cast. Alison Steadman and David Bamber as Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins, respectively, both steal almost every scene that they're in. <br />Regency England is so perfectly recaptured in this film, that you will have trouble visualizing the actors dressed in anything other than cravats and waistcoats. This is a film that will please Austen purists and new viewers alike. The characters are immensley likeable and familiar... some of the most natural comic acting I have ever seen is in this film.<br />See it by all means if you have the opportunity!<BR>Oh, one disappointment: the DVD version has VERY few extras... one incredibly short \\"Making Of P & P\\" sort of thing that leaves one wishing for more. It's a shame there's no commentary or anything. Oh well!
B000002J09|5.0|This is everything Led Zeppelin stands for.  Awesome music, that makes them the greatest band of all time.  The song &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; is the quintessential rock song.

B00005JLEU|3.0|Having seen the preious moives from Hayao Miyazaki, I think I know pretty much what will be happening in this movie. Some sort of man vs. nature kinda thing. To be suprise, this is not the case but rather it is kinda like Alice in Wonderland -- having the big headed motel owner being the queen, and the workers being the solders. I think this movie is just another version of Kiki's Delivery Service with the same theme. One goes in a strange place. One meets some friends. One gets into trouble. One gets excitement. One fights for something. One wins. One gets out the strange place and happy ever. This is not a boring movie but I constantly try to match the plot (if there is any) to the current event around my own life (my own strange place if I may say). This may be a better movie if it is released in the 80's. However, nowaday, we are mostly worrying about war and stuffs like this, this movie just doesn't suit.
B000062XGB|5.0|It is a shame that gorgeous, poignant, sweeping epics such as Anna and the King rarely succeed commercially, as they have so much more to offer on so many different levels than your typical box office smash hits.  I, of course, will watch anything starring Jodie Foster, and I thought she was brilliant in her portrayal of the controversial nineteenth-century tutor to the children of the king of Siam.  I should say that I am judging this movie solely on its own merits as a motion picture; I know nothing about Siamese history and culture, and I have never seen this story as portrayed in The King and I.  I do not know if the Siam we see here, most of which was actually filmed on a massive seven-acre lot far from Southeast Asia, provides a true picture of the land in question, but what we see here is undeniably beautiful.  The filmmakers obviously went to great lengths, preparing everything down to the last detail, to provide a setting for this powerful drama that impacts the viewer quite forcefully and takes him/her to a place he/she has almost surely never gone before.  Not only is the landscape captivating, but the palace, monuments, buildings, and religious icons depicted here are exotically stunning, offering even the most Westernized moviegoer the opportunity of seeing and experiencing an entrancing part of Far Eastern culture.  Traditions and actions that seem immoral and unacceptable are at least made understandable, and that is the fulcrum upon which east and west can meet and work together.<br />This is a special love story, one that is enfolded within a complex vista of much larger, sweeping human dramas.  Some might say the romance falls short, but I believe that the type of romance explored in this movie represents perhaps the toughest form of true love, and what it lacks in demonstrable passion, it more than makes up for in depth of feeling.  English schoolteacher Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster) has come to Siam (via India) to instruct the king's oldest son in English, but quite clearly she is not the type of schoolteacher the king expected, as she refuses to fully embrace the protocols of Siam.  She is committed to showing King Mongkut (Yun-Fat Chow) the respect he deserves, but she stands in his presence, seeks him out rather than waiting to be summoned, and expresses her feelings and beliefs in a manner that would never be tolerated by a Siamese subject of the king.  The king obviously admires her spirit, asking her to teach not only his eldest son but all fifty-eight of his children, one of his wives, and one of his concubines.  The children do not respond to her very well at first, a fact which is not helped in the short run by her own son's spirit of independence, but her compassionate disciplinary ways soon make of her the kind of teacher Mongkut wants for his children.  In time, she and King Mongkut develop a fairly close yet perfectly innocent relationship of their own, sharing a mutual bond of love for the children.  Anna is never afraid to tell Mongkut what she thinks or to get involved in situations her conscience will not allow her to ignore, and a mutual understanding and respect is forged among these paragons of culturally different virtues.  All the while, revolution is stirring in the land, and the king's throne and life itself are placed in great danger, yet Anna's presence and fierce spirit of goodness emerge as a secret weapon that stands to change the very fabric of Siam itself.<br />As wonderful and Oscar-worthy as Jodie Foster's performance is here, Chow-Yun Fat's is even better.  King Mongkut is a complicated man, one who cares deeply about his family and his country, seeking to connect with the western world in order to promote the betterment of both.  He does a magical job of balancing the burdens of a difficult kingship with those of a loving father and a very human man.  Tom Felton is also very good as Anna's son Louis, although it took me a few minutes to see him in this new light once I realized I was watching Harry Potter's nemesis Draco Malfoy playing this role, and the children of King Mongkut are all portrayed masterfully by the whole cast of child actors and actresses.  How this movie did not sweep the Academy Awards for 1999 is a mystery to me.<br />Anna and the King is a movie you can easily and happily immerse yourself in, journeying to a very different world and fully investing yourself emotionally in the drama focused on Anna and King Mongkut.  The behind the scenes features afford a way of appreciating even more fully the job everyone associated with this motion picture did, and the deleted scenes offer a most interesting extended opening and ending to a wondrous picture stretched across two and a half hours in its finished form.  If you have a heart, Anna and the King will speak to it, and you will feel touched in a very special way after watching it.alized I was watching Harry Potter's nemesis Draco Malfoy playing this role, and the children of King Mongkut are all portrayed masterfully by the whole cast of child actors and actresses.

B00009P1MP|5.0|This remastered version of \\"American Pie\\" restores the song to the way McLean intended it to be heard.  Gone is the muddy remixing that has marred prior releases (except for the marvelous remastering done a few years ago by Mobile Fidelity Soundlabs.)  For me, another McLean song from 1981, Castles in the Air, is his best hit.  But \\"Vincent,\\" \\"American Pie,\\" and  others on this album sound amazing.<br />In terms of the cardboard casing, who cares?  It is fine, looks good, and helped keep the price down...  Highly recommended.
0553106635|2.0|I have just finished this book and am still in a daze.  Actually I read all three of the \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" books, one right after another and my eyeballs are ready to fall out.  These are VERY long books!  Not that I at all mind long, thick books.  And let me say that there is something about the way that George R.R. Martin writes that is addictive.  Despite my growing frustration with this series, I could not put any of the books down and walk away.  He pulled me into whatever is going on at the time -- and often there isn't MUCH going on -- even if it is from the POV of one of my not-so-favorite characters.  At first I resented the back-and-forth of the book.  One chapter was about the Wall, the next was about Dany and her dragons... I was tempted to read all the \\"Jon\\" chapters, for instance, all at once and go back and read all the \\"Tryrion\\" chapters etc.  Except that it became obvious that somehow they are all tied together and that skipping back and forth wouldn't work...<br />After praising Martin's writing abilities, I have to say that the overall series is a big disappointment.  Some reviewers insist it's \\"better than Tolkien\\".  Not even close.  The first book, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" started off the series in good shape.  But by the second book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" it was flagging badly.  This book confirms what I dreaded -- Martin is really Robert Jordan and will never end this story.  Jordon's never ending \\"Wheel of Time\\" series is on it's 10th 1000 page book.  I read the reviews for those books and many recommended Martin's series instead.  But what is the difference?  Other than the fact that Martin is a better writer, that is.  This series has bogged down.  How can you not advance the plot in 3000+ pages??  Sure we saw some major characters get removed.  But the plot itself -- i.e. who gets the iron throne -- is as far from resolved as it was in book #1.  There are a couple fewer king wannabes running around but still no real king in sight.  The remaining major characters go from one crises to another but never solve their own individual problems.  And from the trends in book #3, they aren't likely to do so any time soon.<br />I see there is a 4th book coming out (in hardcover, of course).  I would be very surprised if this was the final book of the series.  Why do these authors milk their cash cow to death?  Jordan is still going strong and it looks like Martin is following in his 10+ book footsteps.  When the 4th book comes out I'll get it from the library, if I read it at all.  By the time it's published I'll forget who is on what side (not that that is clear anyway) and what \\"ser\\" has which sigil.  Oh well.  Another promising author lost to the money god...

B00009ATKS|5.0|I feel this album is Mogwai's best. Its shimmering dynamics and melodies definitely represent and put in my mind a state of reflection, or looking back on events in life.  Lost love / the longing for love seems to be present throughout the music, the melodies evoking the dropping of tears on a desk. Spacey and obtuse, otherworldly and alien, beautiful and serene, tranquil and moving, this album is definitely not for the weak of heart, or anyone looking to be uplifted immediately after listening to it, nor for anyone expecting to unwrap the layers of the music on the first listen. Music this beautiful only comes around once in a great while, and it is indeed a blessing in a nifty shimmering silver package.
B00000JMQE|3.0|I'm glad to see any of the other Oz stories even acknowledged, let alone made into film. Having said that, this film wasn't that bad at all. It would have been better had I not been so familiar with all of the characters of the Oz series. Everything was fine until they misnamed the princess with the mix &amp; match heads Mombi! Mombi was a wicked OLD witch with a patch over one eye &amp; a crooked walk. She was responsible for turning Princess Ozma into a boy (thus hiding her) named Tip. The princess with the changing heads was called Princess Languere &amp; she was easily bored, thus she changed her look &amp; mood. <br />This may seem a minor detail to the novice, but they basically<BR>left out a huge chunk of story by trying to combine characters.<BR>Read the books!

B00008WG3U|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I really like nofx. The decline, punk in drublic, white trash..., and so long... are in fact great albums. When I bought and listened to this album, however, I was truly disappointed. How could a band that actually had clever lyrics and a unique sound end up making an album that could only satisfy the stupidest 12 year old? I cannot say that I disagree with the band's opinion of george w. bush but they aren't even good at defaming him. Any moron can say \\"uhhh george bush is stupid\\". Even though it seems to be true, if you're going to make that statement, it wouldn't hurt to justify it. Bottom line is, unfortunately, it seems that nofx's talent is declining, no pun intended.
B00005JKN9|2.0|That this over-produced yet strangely under-developed film received any positive reviews is a testament to the respect film-lovers have for Martin Scorcese.  If \\"Gangs of New York\\" had been directed by someone like Michael Bay (\\"Pearl Harbor\\"), it would have been hooted off the screen.  Unfortunately, if I went into this film without prior knowledge, I'd suspect \\"Gangs\\" was a Michael Bay film -- it's full of half-baked ideas floating in a sea of often incoherent violence.<br />The problems are legion.  The screenplay, for starts, goes from servicable in the first half to ludicrous in the second.  After painstakingly setting up a world in which mere survival is an almost impossible ideal, the filmmakers have their disgraced hero, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), go from pariah to political mover in about three scenes.  For all the film's attention to detail, Boss Tweed is depicted in the broadest, most stereotyped terms.  Meanwhile, the lead characters expend great energy, but the narrative fails to keep their arcs alive and believable.<br />And that brings us to the acting.  Oscar voters were right to pass over Daniel Day Lewis.  His performance is entertaining, but it's pretty much one-note scenery chewing.  Had Day Lewis won, the Academy would have had to retroactively honor Jack Nicholson for his turn as the Joker in \\"Batman\\" (that may sound over the top, but then, so is Day Lewis).  With Day Lewis faltering, it's no surprise that a less experienced lad like Leo also suffers.  He tries, but he's not credible as the fearless leader of men who drives roiling New York to the brink.<br />Finally, there is the overall balance and flow of the story.  That's Scorcese's bailywick, and the master isn't up to it.  He wants to do everything -- grandly -- and ends up creating chaos where there should be taut narrative energy.  The film's final sequence, in which gang violence clashes with a broader city uprising, is so unfocused it undercuts the small amount of genuine passion and human interest the filmmakers had managed to generate.  The ending is bitterly anti-climactic -- even Bill the Butcher deserved better.<br />Finally, the critics who praised \\"Gangs\\" out of loyalty to Scorcese ought to be ashamed of themselves for conning innocent movie-goers as coldly as the Five Points' sharpies hoodwinked passerby.  It's as if the the critics believe being honest about the director's failure here would somehow dim the brilliance of established masterpieces such as \\"Taxi Driver,\\" \\"Raging Bull\\" and \\"Good Fellas.\\"  The irony is that for me and many more like me, being burned by the critics' rote praise for \\"Gangs\\" means I'm less likely to spend dime one on the next Scorcese film.on and human interest the filmmakers had managed to generate.

B00008NRI7|4.0|There were scenes in this movie that were pee your pants funny--specifically the great bathroom search and the stapler incident.  There were also plenty of times when this story dragged.  Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock make an excellent romantic comedy team.  Both have shades of the straight man, but are able to pull off some broad comedy as well.  This ranks right up there with Miss Congeniality as one of Sandra Bullock's funniest movies!
078062565X|5.0|\\"King Kong\\" single-handedly saved RKO Studios from extinction. I cannot believe that a super, classic movie that was way ahead of its time in effects has not been released on DVD. I grew up watching Kong every time it was shown on \\"Million Dollar Movie\\" in New York. As a counterpoint, I saw the 1970'S remake once in the theater and then I went back to the original. I bought the VHS version from Amazon last year and, at the rate I am going, I will wear it out by next year. There is no reason to repeat the plot here as it is related elsewhere. If you are in a position do get this transferred to DVD, here is one fan waiting for it.  Thanks PJ! Your remake, which I thoroughly enjoyed, finally got the studio to release the 1933 Kong on DVD. I am looking forward to the DVD of yours in a few weeks.
0684857820|5.0|As a Syracuse resident, reading this book was all the more difficult because Sebold does such an excellent job of bringing the city to life.  Not only did I feel \\"there\\" during the attack, the investigation, and the court scenes, I now look at my city in a completely different way.  The beautiful amphitheater at Thornden Park is now foreboding, the cultural center of Westcott darker, somehow.  That is how real this memoir is.  Alice Sebold sucked me into her world in 1981.  This memoir was nail-bittingly intense, and, at times, poignantly funny.  I couldn't put it down.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Enigma is a powerhouse to be reckoned with!  They are the only group (or, person for that matter!) that can mix new age, rock, and techno-pop in a way that can please even the harshest listener!  I have been a fan for years, and I was so excited when they released this greatest hits compilation.  Along with Enya, Enigma has the melodious power to move mountains.  Their music is beautiful and inspirational, dark and kinky, depressing and angst-filled, all at the same time.  Who could forget the infectious beats of \\"Sadeness\\" or \\"Return To Innocence?\\"  Or the moody melody of \\"Gravity of Love?\\"  This is a definite must for any music lover.  I put my big rainbow stamp of approval on it!!!!!!
B000002AVF|1.0|Hey guys. Well first I'd like to tell you that I like all kinds of music from pop ( all kind ) to R&B to rock, to punk rock to rap to country. Ok, I think Mariah Carey is ok, not great like other people may rate her as. But this album [is bad].... My sister just gave it to me and after listening to it, I know why. Too many high pitched-cant understand a word she's saying dance songs and sappy.... whispering ballads. Yes, I like Fantasy and it's great to dance to... but.... if you really evaluate her voice, its not that loud, it's all squeaky, and it sounds like she's trying to hard.... not traits for singing divas. And the ballads.... [they're bad]. too many..... slow.... useless, boring songs..... and her dull voice makes it worse....and what is up with the Daydream Interlude? That song is [bad]... sorry its true, if you hear it, you will think that too. Horrible vocals... and the high pitch thing she does--annoying!! I mean, that's considerred singing?
B000002N3N|4.0|I must say that while I truly love Enya's music, this album is my least favorite of all of hers.  It is good, don't get me wrong, but I do not feel as engrossed in the music on this one as I am in the other ones.  Ok, so maybe, Enya has bored me a bit this time, but some of the tunes are awfully good, such as, &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; and &quot;Anywhere Is.&quot;  So, I would never dismiss it as a poor pick, and I do feel that it is a valid Enya album.  It is full of beautiful songs (as is the case with all of her records), and the vocals are ethereal as always.  I would recommend it, though if I were you, I would let this be my first Enya experience, for the rest in the line, and those before it, are, to me, a little better.
B0000640S1|5.0|For years, I had stayed away from the RAMBO series.  I thought they were nothing but senseless violence.  However, the story of John Rambo was quite poignant.  You really felt his emotions as he faces the bigotry of hick policeman in a hick town.<br />Best of all, the DVD extras were few, but of high quality.  I liked the audio commentary being the original author, and how certain changes had to be made.  Even the documentary added to the overall movie experience.<br />I could not recommend this DVD more highly.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is one of the greatest moveies ever made, and astoundingly accurate.  My favorite move of all time.  The soundtrack is just as great, and worth every penny.  This is a must have movie for people that love good action and drama movies, and any Civil War Enthusiast.
B00005U122|5.0|If you are trying to decide between &quot;The Wall (Live in Berlin)&quot; and &quot;In the Flesh (Live)&quot;, you may be interested in what I have to say.  While the concert in Berlin has much more historical significance, I don't think it comes close to the sonic perfection of this DVD (yeah, I said &quot;sonic&quot;).  First of all, the Berlin concert feels more there, whereas &quot;In the Flesh&quot; has a more here feel.  Especially with a decent 5.1 system, you will notice that it really feels like the performance is in your living room rather than on the TV (as with &quot;The Wall&quot;).  The guitar solos really stand out, just wait 'till you hear that wonderful Strat sound, followed by the even sweeter Les Paul wail.  The only complaint I have is that Roger gives up on singing a lot of the higher pitched passages, and relies on other vocalists or the backup singers to fill his place.  That said, whether you like Sepultura, James Brown, Pink Floyd, Santana, Korn, Bob Marley, or anything under the sun, if you could only own 2 concerts on DVD, they would have to be &quot;In the Flesh (Live)&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;.
B000002J03|5.0|This is one of zeppelin's finest efforts, but hey aren't they all? This one is probably my second favorite zeppelin album (zeppelin 4 being my favorite, you can't argue with stairway!). This album will rock your socks off with the exception of thank you which slows things down a bit. Thank you is a nice break from the rest of the albums hard rocking. Bonham struts his stuff on moby dick. The drum solo is one of my favorites of all time and anyone who thinks otherwise does not appreciate one of the best drummers of all time and is not a true zeppelin fan... Ramble on is a great acoustic song that still rocks... <BR>Whole lotta love is probably one zeppelin's most poppy songs but it still rocks. It has a bridge in the middle that you can only enjoy if you're cooked up on drugs. What is and what should never be has a great contrast between hard rocker and ballad(yah it's totally rad). Lemon song is a great hard rocking blues song. Heart breaker is great rocker with a bit of blues.Living loving woman is another great rocker and the kicker bring it on home is a great blues song that progresses to a hard rockin in your face song! This album rules no one does it better than zep! This album is truly a hard rocker and an all time great rock album! ...

Casting is terrfic 2. Costumes thank goodness Catherine knew how to draw out those sketches 3. Awesome making of the film I love the making cause it showed my favortie part of my favortie songs and we got to see what Ewan acted like off the set which would be a ordinary guy that drinks 7 Up and loves to laugh. 4. The Music Ewan and Nicole have very good vocal levels as well as the supporting cast Richard Roxburgh, Jim Broadbent etc and the songs are well composed! 5. EWAN IS A HOTTTIE!<BR>Scale: 1 to 100 a 99 this movie is good for teens and people who are beginning to date the song Come What May is kind of marry like type song because Christian and Satine kept the song between them and Christian knew whatever may happen that they would be together. <BR>Moral: The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return - As quoted by Christan<BR>Note: I have wrote a remake of this when Louis a seventeen year old writer ventures into a bohemian world and he falls in love with the main attraction at the Moulin Rouge Ginger a.k.a Teh Sparkling Diamond and he gos on a dazzling adventure that has intrigue, danger and romance! Louis and Ginger are more serious he kisses her all the time in this film and in two scenes they are holding hands. <BR>Bottom Line: The movie Moulin Rouge is great and so is my version of it!

0385720920|2.0|After seeing the movie Fight Club, I became interested in author Chuck Palahniuk.  He seemed to have such a fiendish sense of humor and made some very provacative commentary with Fight Club, so I decided to read Choke.  That was in December.  This is July, and I still have not been able to finish.   Don't get me wrong--this book has the same cynical view that endeared me to Fight Club, but it just seems a bit pretentious with its dictionary-style addenda spattered throughout and the character's odd choices of phrases such as &quot;For serious, dude.&quot;<br />Ughhh... it makes me shudder just remembering how tedious and annoying this had become.  <br />My flight  was delayed for 8 hours in Mexico City yesterday, and even THEN, faced with utter boredom, I still did not reopen Choke for another go.  I guess I will finish it eventually, but I sincerely hope the next Palahniuk book I read is ALOT  easier to swallow.
6305291489|5.0|This is a terrific movie with a first-rate case headed by talented Lindsay Lohan.  My only disappointment is the DVD presentation with no director's commentary and no extras. I also own the laserdisc version of this movie which had commentary, Lindsay's screen tests, clips showing how they turned Lindsay into twins, and deleted scenes (Hallie meets the Queen in London!). <br />Are we going to have to wait years later for a special edition?  I know that Disney films are marketed as family movies and that perhaps younger children aren't as interested in the extras, but I think it would be great for them to see some info on how the movie was made. The Emperor's New Groove (another entertaining Disney film), on the other hand, did come with commentary by the animators--go figure.
B000002897|4.0|Everytime I listen to this and &quot;Dust&quot;, I wonder why &quot;Screaming Trees&quot; weren't as huge as the other four Seattle grunge bands. They certainly were in the same league at least. This album starts really strong with &quot;Shadow of the Season&quot; and doesn't let up much after. The second song &quot;Nearly lost You&quot; was on the &quot;Singles&quot; soundtrack also. &quot;Mark Lanegan&quot; has a unique and rough voice that fits the music well. Recently he's sung with &quot;Queens of the Stoneage&quot;. Overall, if you're a fan of that classic-grunge-rock sound, and don't know &quot;Screaming Trees&quot;, get this album. It's sweet.
B000099T2L|1.0|I was expecting Beyonce's CD to be the best out of all of the solo Destiny Child members CD's. However, this CD turned out to be yet another disappointment. With &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; being the only standout track. Her duet with Luther Vandross is decent, but I've heard it before. It's really nothing special. The Missy track &quot;Signs&quot; isn't worth listening to more than once. The rest of the songs sound like &quot;filler&quot; type songs. I'm sure many will not agree with my review, but I was highly disappointed. Kelly Rowland's CD was much better than Beyonce's effort. And even Michelle's CD was better. For the one having the most talent out of all of them, this was very surprising. She should review her material and find out what went wrong.
B000002H97|5.0|METALLICA'S self titled black album is a spectacular album! It features songs with great riffs and songs with great melodies and much more. the best songs on it are &quot;Enter sandman&quot;, &quot;Sad but true&quot;, &quot;Holier than thou&quot;, &quot;The ungorgivin&quot;, &quot;Wherever I may roam&quot;, &quot;Don't tread on me&quot;, &quot;trough the never&quot;, &quot;Nothing else matters&quot;, &quot;Of wolf and man&quot;, &quot;The god that failed&quot;, &quot;My friend of misery&quot;, and &quot;The stuggle within&quot;. Oh, well I guess that's all the songs. Oh well, all the songs are awesome! No metallica fan should be without this cd. It's just plain spectacular!!!BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!
B000099T2L|5.0|Now, I had to post another review again to truly exemplify in words the amount of appreciation I have for Beyonce Knowles as a solo musician.  <br />This album is truly a great R&B album to have in any collection.  Nothing remotely [bad] or unhearable is on this album.  \\"Baby Boy\\" is HOTTTTTTT!  The combination of reggae and R&B just connects real well on this album.  Sean Paul doesn't disappoint with a strong SP flow. \\"Yes\\" is a great slow song.  Don't put it with \\"One In A Million\\" by Aaliyah.  It's truly a left to that song.  \\"Speechless\\" can't be denied.  It's a love-making song that's full of sexual and physical emotion.  \\"Gift From Virgo\\" is just great.  Now, I compliment Beyonce just being at ease with her versatile, soprano vocal range on this song.  She doesn't outdo herself.  It's just peaceful.  \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" is a great remake and it fits well with Beyonce vocally. \\"Daddy\\" is testimony of Beyonce being appreciative of Mathew Knowles, her father, and his true participation in her life and father, manager, and friend.  <br />We all know that Beyonce is the lead singer and frontwoman of Destiny's Child, but this album takes her away from all of that and truly allows you to truly see how talented she is all by herself.  She truly does an excellent job with writing, producing, arranging, and singing on this album (i.e. Jay-Z co-wrote on 5 songs).  <br />Truly take a real listen at this album.  Now, you can't compare her or knock her out of the box from any other female vocalist, because she's her and that's it.  She truly is a multi-talented female entertainer.  This R&B album is just a piece of an enormous pie of talent that is imprinted in Beyonce Knowles' soul and being.<br />And I must stress that her solo album outtops Kelly and Michelle's solo album.  Beyonce is just talented.  And that's REALITY!!!!!!!
6303443214|1.0|It seems like almost every review I read of this is good and I totally do not understand that. What was the point of making this movie? Tom Cruise is an excelent actor but I thought he made the worst Lestat I could imagine! Brad Pit wasn't as bad as Tom Cruise but I didn't think he was perfect for the role by a long shot. I could name the things this movie and the book have in common on one hand. Rice was right the first time, Tom Cruise was an terrible choice. I thought the portryal of Claudia was cheep and tacky. What was with the scene where she cuts off her hair, leaves the room, and when she re-enters it is all back, couldn't they have done a better job with that? And the #1 thing about that scene is, am I the only one who noticed/realized that she has bangs!? Hello, can someone explain to me why all her hair grows back so fast and long but her bangs stay short!? I was also shocked at the casting for the charector Armand. Bold, stark features vs. boyish cupid ones, not to mention the age factor. I do not get how Anne Rice fans and vampire fans alike could find this movie appealing and not appaling. <BR>I havn't even covered everything.
B00006CXXU|4.0|It's obvious that Christina worked very hard on this album, and for that, she is to be commended. She put herself out there, \\"stripped,\\" as the title claims, and shows how she really feels.<BR>The music is good, solid pop, but nothing extraordinary. (Save, maybe, for \\"Beautiful.\\")
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is perfect!  Every song is uniquely great.  It opens strong with politik, and stays up with in my place, and got put a smile.  The singles the scientist and clocks are awesome slower piano \\"ballads.\\"  It gets up again with daylight.  Warning sign and green eyes could be the best two songs if rush of blood and amsterdam aren't.  This album must be listened to completely for full greatness.
0060977264|2.0|This author came highly recommended to me by a friend whose opinion I trust.  Instead of starting out with his most celebrated book the Alchemist, I picked up this one.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with the style in which it is written and the content of this book.  <br />This story is told by a 29 year old woman named Pilar, whose goal in life is to find a husband to settle down with.  The way in which she portrays her desires, her fears, her reflections on her essence, her vices and weakness and the way she goes about recognizing them is too immature and unlikely for any woman.  I presume that the logic of her thoughts is that simple and naïve is because of the fact that she comes from a small village and is not trained to overanalyze details the way big city people do.  But I don't believe that is the case.  In my opinion, the author does not do justice to understanding the nature of the female enough to write about it.  From the thoughts of this woman, it is clear that it is not written by someone who understands our nature, and the lack of credibility of this character becomes apparent from the first pages of the book.<br />The biggest disappointment of the book, however, comes from having to put up with so much religious nonsense that becomes part a theory that is absurd.  While this story is about the recovery of faith, the process seems very superficial because it is not questioned and there is no internal conflict, the woman blindly accepts whatever she is handed out on the platter and talks about the synthesis of the information as though she's been preaching it forever.  Such immediate acceptance of faith lacks substance and credibility.<br />In the end, this book has its moments, but it's certainly not of the inspirational caliber.
0156027321|5.0|You will enjoy this adventurous book tremendously.  It is hard to put down and has a wonderful twist at the end.  It will take you on a spiritual journey of a young man and recount his story (fact or fiction?) of dealing with a dramatic event in his life.  I loved it and have shared it with family and friends.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin's fourth studio album is one that epitomizes everything a rock album should be. It contains hard rockers, mellow acoustic sets, and a combination of both. There really isn't anything to be said about this album that hasn't already been mentioned. It is very continuous, lacking a weak point that can ruin the album's feel. It is also a great record for those who have not been introduced to the band. It was my first Led Zeppelin album and since then I have attempted to acquire as much of their catalogue as possible. Rock music does not get much better than this.
B000002H97|1.0|For those of you that think Metallica is a good band and heavy,get alife. Listening to Metallica in this day in age is like listening to Michael Bolton,its not heavy at all,just pure soft rock. Lastly thank you Weird Al Yankovic for making fun of Metallica with the song Enter Napster.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I believe that anyone who puts this CD into their CD player will find something that they love.  Shakira has once again fused all sorts of different kinds of music from all over the world into a unique mix that only Shakira can pull off.  For instance, &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; contains the sounds of traditional Brazilian drums and Andean flutes as well as instruments associated with the middle east, but still has the feel of an average American pop song.  The song &quot;Fool&quot; has sounds that are undoubtly rock, and &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;, which is an English remake of her Spanish language mega-hit &quot;Ojos Asi&quot;, blares from your CD player with Middle Eastern instruments and even the Arabic language.  Fans of her older Spanish language music will find that Shakira hasn't abandonded them...&quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;, a song that is a fusion of rock and pop, and &quot;Que Me Quedes Tu&quot;, which has sounds associated with Asia, are also featured on the CD, as well as &quot;Suerte&quot;, a Spanish version of &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, and &quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio&quot;, which is a Spanish version of &quot;Objection&quot;, a song that contains traditional Latin rhythms.  Trust me, no matter what kind of music you like, you'll find something on this album.  It has pop, rock, Latin, and even Middle Eastern music, and everything else in between.  I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone.

While the movie version is greatly sanitized from the racy Cain novel, it's still a classic and Crawford leads a stellar cast.  Sure, it can get a bit melodramatic at times, but you can't help but be thoroughly engrossed and Crawford delivers many dead-on moments of real Oscar caliber acting.  How ironic that her off-screen mothering was so lacking!
B00005LC1H|5.0|One of the funniest British Comedy series ever produced ... some of John Cleese's finest work for the small screen.  Much of his inspiration for his character in A Fish Called Wanda can be seen germinating in this BBC Television series.<br />Recommended for anyone having a bad day ...
B000002JEV|5.0|I taped a good portion of this off, I think, The King Biscuit Flour Hour in 1984 or '85. It was the only time it was broadcast in many, many years. The tape had all the static the iron-filled mountains can provide but I loved it.<br />I think most Zeppelin fans experienced some disappointment at seeing &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; (the first time they saw it sober anyway). Between this and the new DVDs (also 5 star) Zeppelin's reputation as a killer live band is finally restored a bit.<br />Anyway, just wanted to add another 5 star rating to the wood pile.
B00000JA9Z|5.0|This is an LP that I recommend thoroughly, for whos love the rock, because we can listen the notes of the vocalist of the group and the strident guitars and the compass of the drums. If you can, buy it.
037540872X|5.0|my friend lent me this book. I also saw the movie after reading. I enjoyed both but I think the book was better.This was a quick read which is great for me( mom of two).I can't wait to try more of Sparks books.
B00005JM09|2.0|I saw the movie over the weekend and I am a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The movie did have great stunts, special effects and explosions.  But the movie did not have much of a story line to go with it.  The poor plot of the movie did not link well with what the original movie and T2 set as the foundation for the series.   Arnold has not made much of an impact at the movies lately and this T3 basically looks like a career-ending move for him.
B00005J6UP|5.0|this movie is one of my faves. i can't help but watch it everytime i notice it's on tv. it was better than most 80s movie but not as good as the lost boys.
0316666343|4.0|I actually enjoyed this book.  It was uniquely written and surprisingly held my interest.  Though I enjoyed it and think everyone who reads it will enjoy it, I was disappointed in the ending.
B00004Z459|5.0|Defintely not the kind of music I'm used to listening too (I've been a country fan all my life)! I was blasting this when my dad walked in, did a double take &quot;Didn't know you did rap&quot;. &quot;Niether did I!&quot; But ... this album's awesome! I love it! It doesn't get me in trouble with my mom, and I even got my little brother to like Papercut! Of course, that had more to do with the Anime Music Video I showed him, but still ... I really liked this album, and I'd recommend it to anyone! Now, if only somebody'd ask for my recommendation ...
6305908648|5.0|Nice DVD...starts out mellow, with guest vocalists and the orchestra with Jon Lord in charge. Concerto for Group and Orchestra kicks in, and is great. Differences in the '69 version for sure (which is worth buying, also). The group rocks out more..all original members except Blackmore replaced by Steve Morse who can handle the guitar duties great. would have been a great concert to have been at--they did it all.
B00005JM09|2.0|I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan so I am doing this review without being bias.  The movie had great action sequences, special effects and stunts.  I think the story lacked some detail in linking all the ends form the original movie and T2 to the new T3 plot. I think T3 ruined the Terminator movies.
B00004W19V|5.0|i love any movies with steve guttenberg. he did a great job in this great movie. watch this for a great movie.
B00005NMVP|5.0|&quot;Year Of The Cat&quot; was Al Stewart's breakthrough hit in America.  The album was produced by Alan Parsons, who also produced Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; to much acclaim.  The remastering job done on this import CD is outstanding. Peter White's acoustic guitar playing, featured in the song &quot;On The Border,&quot; especially sounds vibrant. The first bonus track is a live version of that song. The second bonus song, &quot;Belsize Blues,&quot; was never officially released and alone is worth the price of this CD. More of a rocker than a blues number, it features a bluesy harmonica not heard elsewhere on the album. The lyrics flow along in a style very reminiscent of early Bob Dylan. The third bonus track is not a song at all. Al discusses the musicians who played on the album and briefly explains the meaning of each song. I highly recommend this import CD to all fans of Al Stewart.
0760707251|5.0|I recently read this with my six-year old son, and we both greatly enjoyed it.  We were familiar with the Paramount film of the same title, and enjoyed reviewing the differences.  E.B. White's prose is marvelous and is a nice exploration of words with a young reader.  I particularly enjoyed the \\"special read along edition\\" as it helped my son follow along and pick up the reading at different points because it was so easy to see, and the illustrations were as well.  I highly recommend the book and the version.  We also recently read Trumpet of the Swan by the same author and enjoyed it as well.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' debut CD is, to me, the perfect Sunday morning.  Every time that I listen to her, the mood of my Sunday mornings creep in.  This is a wonderful CD to curl up in bed, drink coffee and read a book.  Its peaceful, but doesn't put you to sleep.  Perfect.
0385504209|1.0|Pure garbage, and an insult to the minds of good people. This writers intentions are in a faryland. What starts out to be good mystery, ends out being pure garbage. I really don't know how else to discribe this rag of a book. I will use it for fire knidling when the weather gets cold.
0385509456|5.0|The development of the protagonist, as well as your concern  for his wellbeing, progresses steadily  and in all dimensions, to the end. The mystery of the &quot;dog incident&quot; in the title takes an appropriate back seat to the real star of the show: the mind of our young man, with all it's pitfalls and idiosyncratic strengths.  I actually worried about him, and then listened to him work things out in his unique way. Yes, he's working on solving a mystery (and a rather heinous one at that), but he's also trying to make sense of our world, emphasis on &quot;our&quot;. As for his world, he's doing just fine, and in specific ways, far better than &quot;just fine&quot;, which is much more than can be said about some people in his life.  Finally, there is another character in the book, very subtley presented, who is someone we all need at some time or another; and, if you can identify or find a person like that for yourself, then you can navigate your world with assurance and in peace. We're all fragile, but only as broken, demeaned or helpless as we allow each other and ourselves to be.  And our heroic young man, with his impressive array of implements in his mental toolbox, allows neither. I'll lend this book  to as many friends as I can, and when I do, I'll make it very clear that  I want it back.
B00005JM09|2.0|T-3 was decent. It was worth seeing but I wasn't impressed. Oddly enough Arnold's acting wasn't very convincing. (Normally I'm an Arnold fan) The action was good but there were so many things that were way out of proportion and they tried too hard to think up new \\"cool\\" ideas for the latest model terminator.<br />I have to admit Kristana Token (the TX) did a good job acting out the character. Aside from her being drop-dead gorgeous, she was convincing and cold-hearted as they come! What a woman....
B00009L1TA|3.0|This is a good story if you can stomach the winding plot, which takes several sharp turns throughout the movie, making it a little hard to follow at times.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give good performances and this is probably one of the best performances I've ever seen from Sharon Stone.  She's quite believeable in her role as an Army captain.  However, like many military films, this one takes some great liberties with what does and doesn't happen in the military, but it's fiction, so it's excusable in its context.
B000096I9G|1.0|This dvd is DEFECTIVE.  Chapter 9 of the first disc is scrambled and not acceptable. The Cure should be ashamed for releasing this inferior product.  Besides chapter 9, the rest of the dvd is good and is worth at least 4 stars.
B000002B2T|5.0|Mad Season, the so-called &quot;Grunge Supergroup&quot; combines the talents of Alice In Chains' Layne Staley, Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, the Screaming Trees' Barrett Martin and also features blues bassist John Baker Saunders, and Screaming Trees' Mark Lanegan on a couple of tracks.  This album is a masterpiece.  Instead of serving as a &quot;Layne Staley solo project,&quot; which some have referred to it as, it is a group effort all the way.  The late Baker Saunders was an amazing, if little-heard bassist, and McCready, who never really got to excercise his songwriting muscles in Pearl Jam, wrote some great riffs here.  Staley, as usual, is in fine form, both as an awe-inspiring vocalist and top-of-the-line songwriter and lyricist.  As a matter of fact, Staley hadn't really addressed his pathos in song so clearly since his main band's &quot;Dirt&quot; album.  Loneliness, depression, addiction and coming to terms with those problems, or attempting to, are the themes addressed in these songs.  This is by no means a &quot;feel good&quot; album, but as with most great art, most everything Layne did came from pain.  The avowed influence of classic '70's rock shared by both Staley and McCready (who both came up in the Seattle scene playing in 'glam metal' bands early on) is apparent on several tracks, like &quot;I'm Above,&quot; which contains a killer guitar riff and a nice McCready acoustic solo.  The crunchy &quot;I Don't Know Anything,&quot; with Layne and Mike's guitar see-sawing riffs is another great track--simple, but very beautiful.  Also, the collaboration with Mark Lanegan (&quot;Long Gone Day&quot;) can't be missed, with its eerie, jazzy atmosphere and some guest saxophone by Nagalas Sin-Carne.
B000099T2L|5.0|I love the album. I love Beyonce and her beautiful body and voice. I think she really did her thang on this album. I really love the song &quot;Yes.&quot;
6303921248|5.0|THE BEST MOVIE EVER AND I AM A KID WHO THINKS SO.
630289915X|1.0|This is an extremely poor movie.  It is a shameless enterprise in sentimentality, constantly bordering on bathos.  Typical of many American films both of that period and contemporary times.  Very boring to boot.<br />It gets all its mileage out of holiday sentiments, and the hazy glow of the holidays colors too many people's view of the film.
B000002JS6|5.0|who DOESN'T own this album?!? man what are you waiting for? click add to shopping cart.  why? let me explain :<br />a) this is known as one of AC/DC's greatest albums of all time<br />b) this is known as one of rock's greatest albums of all time<br />c) with songs like hells bells, shoot to thrill, let me put my love into you, back in black, shook me all night long, and noise pollution...how could you POSSIBLY go wrong?!?!<br />now this isn't a typical review for me...I usually write long, educated, specific reviews, but I figure this album speaks for itself. Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you don't already have it. If you're just getting into AC/DC, you will definately enjoy it. If you don't, tell me and I will refund you the money myself.<br />WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?! CLICK THE BUTTON! ;-)
B00005JM09|5.0|I think I enjoyed this primarily because it was different to the first two Terminator movies. Sure, the plot was the same. Killer robot gets sent back in time to assassinate the leader of the human resistance, and another killer robot is sent back to protect him.<br />The difference with this movie, though, is that the one sent back to do the protecting at no time gets sentimental, warm and fuzzy, or lovey dovey. There is the distinct impression, throughout the entire film, that this particular T-101 terminator could just as easily turn around and snap Connor's neck as take a bullet for him.<br />There are plenty of one-liners to be had, some corny and some not. The scene at the start where Arnie acquires his clothing is totally hysterical. There are definitely places in this film where you can't help thinking that the director and the actors just weren't taking it, or themselves, seriously. Rest assured this is not to the movie's detriment. The humour only helps relieve the tension that might otherwise have turned the film in an unbearable mind job.<br />Kristanna Loken more than does the job as the new and improved Terminator, sent back to [destroy]not only Connor, but also men and women who will become his deputies. She gives a good impression of a machine with sole intent, but who can't quite help enjoying itself in the process.<br />The demolition scenes that result from the two Terminators battling are spectacular, and there is one hell of a hair-raising car chase through the city (I wouldn't go so far as to say it meets the standards of the car chase in Matrix Reloaded, but it is mind-blowing to watch).<br />Despite what local reviewers have said, I think Nick Stahl and Claire Danes were a good pair-up for this film. It doesn't detract at all from not having Edward Furlong reprising the role of John Connor.<br />Nick Stahl was perfect in his role. People have to remember that what we are being presented with is a young man who thinks (but isn't positive) that his destiny as leader in the war against the machines has been thwarted by the actions he, his mother and his Terminator protector took some years ago. This is a young man who is now uncertain of his future role, but still suffers nightmarish visions of what the world was supposed to become.<br />This is not yet the battle-hardened warrior that is depicted in the 'flash-forwards' of all three movies. This is just a young man who wants to stay anonymous, and untraceable.<br />Hence, he is hardly surprised when a Terminator appears abruptly one night, saying it is there to protect him. The surprises start coming with the Terminator's determination to also protect former once-off kissing companion Kate Brewster....<br />Someone criticised the lack of chemistry between Danes and Stahl. They were well off the mark with that criticism, because the film was not meant to focus on any serious romantic attachments. Stahl and Danes didn't need to 'click' like that right then. Should there be a fourth film (and I seriously hope there is after seeing T3), then that will be something that they might need to focus on then. ...iny as leader in the war against the machines has been thwarted by the actions he, his mother and his Terminator protector took some years ago.

6304584598|4.0|There were a lot of closeups of Nureyev. obviously he played a big part in the production of this video. Margot Fonteyn just kinda disappeared into the background.  Their dancing was impeccable nonetheless. The corps was lamentable, and the orchestra was utterly disappointing. Nureyev's hoggishness evident in all the focus that was put upon his performance was discouraging as well. But Margot's dancing in this particular performance was worthy of all the praise she has received in her career and after. Her performance is what really saved this dvd from being considered a flop. For Margot, 4 stars.
B000089RVX|5.0|1. Going Under- I love this song so much because when she sings it you can see she has an attitude. Also when she sings it she sings it with so much emotion that you almsot feel like your going through the same thing she is. 4.5/5<BR>2. Bring Me To Life- Another great song. I like this song because it starts out so soft, and ends very soft. My favourite part is the music. It would probably sound great even without the lyrics, but it kicks [booty] with the lyrics. 5/5<BR>3. Everybody's Fool- The music starts out very soft but then gets louder. She builds up her singing until you get to the chorus. She sings it out so loud. Like she relaly meens it. 4/5<BR>4. My Immortal- A song that seems to mean alot to me. I am only 13 but i can feel, and relate to the lyrics. It's very hard to descibe why i like this song so much, but i guess i like how it sounds. So haunting. Like mist. Not too loud, but still there.3.5/5<BR>5. Haunted- My favourite. Maybe because im dark but i still like it. Like there's a secret to her and she might let it out. Something from her past thats dark, and haunts her.5/5<BR>6. Tourniquet- A song that i didn't really get until i asked my dad what it ment. Now i get it and i really apprecite it. It's such a deep song that just gets better and better the more you listen to it. 5/5<BR>7. Imaginary-Everybody has a place where they need to rest. Whether it's magical or real. Her singing sounds like she's really in her magical world. I love it! 5/5<BR>8. Taking over me- Alot of people say they like this song the most and i might have to agree with the,. IT starts out so hard and goes on to her beautiful singing. IT's a very balanced song. 5/5<BR>9. Hello- My least favourite one, but i still appreciate the work they put into it. It's still bery meaningful. But what i don't like about it is that it's so slow. I dont relaly know. 3/5<BR>10. My last Breath- My favourite one. \\"All i wanted to say is that i love you, and im not afraid\\" Thats the best part. So much love goes into this song it's amazing. Im still trying to figure out what this song means but meanwhile im enjoying the lyrics and the way she puts so much passion into it.<BR>11. Whisper- I actualyl quite like this song. \\" im frightened by what i see, but somehow i know that there is much more to come\\" Sort of a voice that tells you all the bad things in life, and it's not a joke. Like rules to live by.<BR>I am 13 and i love to write. When i grow up i want to make music for someone like me. To listen to , and feel so inspired that they want to grow up and do what they did. That is what i feel about Amy Lee and her band. I write songs and im intending to be famous. Mostly it's very dark and alot of meaning and thats why i love this c.d. 5/5
B000002BYD|5.0|Yield is an amazing album. It holds its own as one of the most rock solid hard rock albums of the 90's. It ranks up there with Radiohead's The Bends and Smashing Pumpkins' Siamese Dream, although all three are in totally different time periods during the 90s. Pearl Jam did something new and exciting, and it's certainly better than what they are putting out now.<br />Standout songs include  Brain Of J, Faithful, No Way, Given To Fly, Wishlist, Pilate, MFC, Low Light, and In Hiding (one of my absolute favorites). All Those Yesterdays is a good track to close off the album with. With the noodling around of the F chord to the powerful midsection, this was a good choice to end this rather expiramental album with. It leaves the listener thinking &quot;???&quot;...<br />I personally think this album is better than Ten for various reasons:  A) Ten seemed to keep the same beat and same path on the whole album; Yield takes several turns and seems to bloom like a spring flower as it unfolds while you listen (i.e. &quot;Low Light&quot;) B) Pearl Jam really seemed to take a dive at this album...not sure whether they should have tried something new or if they should have stuck to their roots. Good desicion for this album, but later albums proved wrong.<br />So if you're even considering picking this album up, please don't hesitate very long. We only live for a short time on this earth, and you really want to put something good into your CD player, right? After that we can listen to the beautiful music of the Holy Spirit in Heaven, but for now...Pearl Jam will do.<br />I consider this Pearl Jam's last GOOD album. Binaural and Riot Act just didn't do it for me, sorry. I don't buy into what the fans like...I buy into what I like. And that's YIELD.
B00008OLIC|5.0|The last Classic Crue album and tied best along wit Shout at the Devil, this album is the epitomy of the 80s Spirit, and one of the best offerings of the Hair/Pop/Glam Metal Genre. Neil's high-pitched screech and Mick Mars' Guitar virtuosity are excellent, while the Rythm Section (Lee and Sixx) plays tight. This is the Sleazy 80s Image at its best!<br />Best songs: Dr. Feelgood [9/10] Classic Hard-htting Rocker!, Kickstar My Heart [9/10] Fast Heavy Track, Without You [8/10] Awesome ballad, Times for Change [9/10] One of the best 80s Ballads ever.
B00005JMC6|5.0|this movies is deinitely ranking among one of the best movies of the year right now.  this is the kind of movie that makes drama wonderful.  the message that comes across the strongest is the message of love within the family.  the main character played by keisha castle-hughes is top notch and is incredibly impressive considering her young age.  you see every emotion come across her face i this movie and she is utterly believable.  this is a story about generational gaps and how the older generation holds on to beliefs so hard that they are willing to disregard family over tradition.  this movie has many female equality issues weaved into the story and each of them is well founded.  when the young girl's grandfather repeatedly tells her that she cannot participate because she is a girl he often pretends that she does not exist.  however on each of the tasks he teaches to the first born boys she is able to outdo all of them.  on more than one occasion she defies the odds and proves that she is the whale rider that the old traditions have spoken of, and the fact that she is female is just unacceptable to her grandfather.  there are many very emotional moment sin this film that could bring a tear to your eye.  i wont talk about them here because they are best experienced in the movie.  go and see this film it is well worth the time and money.  this is a nice glimpse into a people that are very unique and have ways that are not our own but still hold meaning for the people who descended from the whale rider.  it is also a story about love within the family and how almost losing something can make a person realize how much somethiong really means to them.  there is a lesson in this movie that reveals differences between the generations and how in actuality the opposing generations have equal leesons to learn from each other.  excellent film go and see it!
B00005JLT5|5.0|One of the most magical aspects of movie making can be found in the rare occasion when such a dramatization of a best-selling book results in an equally spellbinding film.  Of course, the fact that it was Academy Award winning director Roman Polanski chosen to direct the project was a critical choice in bringing this shattering story of a man who found his humanity in classical music even in the midst of the Nazi takeover of Poland during World War Two to the screen. Given Mr. Polanski's personal experience as a Holocaust survivor, he has an exceptionally well-hewn capability to recreate all the sights, sounds, and sensibilities of the times to the movie with loving accuracy. In so doing he has created a modern masterpiece along the lines of such similar treatments of the period as Stephen Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List\\".<br />Yet, while Spielberg apparently was striving to paint a broader-brushed treatment of the period and the horrific excesses of the Nazi treatment of the indigenous Jewish population during the war, Polanski concentrates much more exclusively on the personal journey of a solitary human being, in this case a pianist so singularly focused on his art and its centrality to his existence that he is often almost schizophrenic in his ability to ignore or block out all the mayhem, chaos and destruction that surrounds his every move.  Against such a backdrop of the momentous events transpiring from the German army's invasion of Poland in September of 1939 through the end of the war is the pianist's story so marvelously told. His survival through the most barbaric of conditions imaginable is a testament both to his good luck and his hardy strength of will to survive for the sake of his blessed classical music.<br />Young actor Adrian Brody, in an Academy Award winning performance, both accurately and amazingly portrays the almost unbelievable events experienced by author/pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman as he makes his tortured way through the brutal gauntlet of the Nazi killing machine bent on the systematic extermination through the combined strategies of enforced work regimes, slow starvation, and murder in the death camps. The protagonist survives through a combination of his own wits as well as through the unexpected and strictly forbidden assistance of others, many of whom literally risked their own safety and lives by reaching out to aid him.<br /> Polanski puts a human face on the Germans as well, showing at one point how in the midst of the unspeakable horror many of his colleagues were visiting on the Polish Jews and gypsies, even an officer in the Wehrmacht could be willing to risk his own safety to assist the pianist. The cinematography is remarkable, with a superb depiction of the massive destruction that modern war brings in its wake. The overshots of a totally destroyed Warsaw is a graphic demonstration of such total devastation on a scale so unimaginable that it would be otherwise difficult to grasp either intellectually or emotionally. This is a film that belongs in any serious film fan's library, and one I can heartily recommend for all but the youngest viewers.

6304401132|5.0|This is a Disney classic sure to please all! This is the story of a princess, Aurora, who is guarded by 3 fairies from an evil witch who has cast a spell on her. The spell - to prick her finger on a sewing needle by sundown on her 16th birthday and fall into a long sleep - gives the King & Queen reason to send their daughter away with 3 fairies to raise her and keep her safe until after her 16th birthday.  Aurora is unaware she is a princess, and that she has been promised to a prince. She falls in love with a boy she meets in the woods one day - and is later saddened to learn of her true identity.<br />I don't want to give it all away - so I'll stop there!  It is a delightful movie that my 4 & 5 yr old girls request to watch often.  The end has a bit of scare for too young of eyes - but not too scary and short lived. I recommend you add this to your Disney library - if you haven't already!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B00006CXXU|2.0|With some exceptions, the album isn't as good as you all review. Christina shows she can write, and even produced one song. I am still not feeling the album except for some songs, like Dirrty, Beautiful, Fighter, Can't Hold Us Down, Infatuation and I'm OK. I was slightly disapppointed after hearing this album. You call this quality? Why?! Because it's a boring ballads album? Again, with some exceptions. Don't get me wrong, the writing's good, even the producing of Linda Perry - but way too much ballads for an album.. and let's face it, as much as you call her &quot;talented&quot; - Mariah's voice is way more powerful, so is Whitney's. Uh, they all sound the same in a way anyway! I prefer some cool unique vocals.<br />This album makes it clear, Britney is the one that was born to make us happy, not Christina - so far. Watch out for Britney's 4th album that includes works with: P. Diddy, Moby, Metro, Cathy Dennis, Shep Solomon, Daft Punk, The Matrix and the creator of the &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; masterpiece - William Orbit. There is alot to expect. And Britney still saves the honor of the first pop singer to have a mature album this time.
B000092ZYX|3.0|If you are a die-hard Radiohead fan, maybe you should buy this album (you probably already have).  However, if you are not a big-time Radiohead fan and desire to 1) listen to a CD all the way through with one dominant mood (calm, anxious, etc) or 2) long for Radiohead's ballads from The Bends, then don't buy this disc, and help lessen the hype on this disc.  Radiohead is still experimenting, using the listener as the patient.  Songs on this album often begin with a nice guitar track or a lilting falsetto vocal only to morph into trance beats that I found distracting.  Other songs become extremely heavy all too quickly thereby defeating the mood already established.  Radiohead may have decided that the world is post-modern, but those of us still paying taxes and living in a reality that still holds some semblance of normality may wish to find another band to emulate and listen to.
B00005JM09|4.0|This is a very worthy sequel to \\"Terminator\\" and \\"Terminator 2.\\" <BR>Terminator 3 has alot of well-crafted action scenes, has excellent actors (including Mr. S. himself...hehe), and was very well scripted. I like how this movie manages to be funny, scary and exciting all at the same time. To me, this was a more absorbing and riveting film than the second Terminator. This is an excellent film with all factors of a good movie intact.
B00006G8O1|5.0|This is one of the most original movies i have ever seen and i wish i could have seen it in the theatres! The whole cast does an excellant job along with excelant direction and haunting music. the songs go so well with the pictire also &quot;Head over heels etc. this is one of those films where after it is over you sit there in awe! I cannot believe people have called this movie stupid. Obviously they did not get the meaning of this movie. I also love the 80's feel to it. if you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor and watch it! recommended it! A beautiful, haunting and orgingal movie that will leave you speechless!
6305014140|3.0|I'm not going to go through an synopsis of the story, since thier are plenty of other reviewers doing that.  To put it briefly it about a wanderlust ninja, who is forced into fighting demons each with special powers.<br />While you won't find anything new in terms of plotlines, Ninja Scroll is certainly one of the better Animes in terms of action.  Plenty of fighting scenes, with our protagonist choping away at them.  But be forewarned those who are light of heart, this anime can be quite graphic - the &quot;blood gushing&quot; and &quot;limbs missing&quot; are in full effect - and thier are a few nudity scenes which are far from artistic.<br />You could skip over this Manga for one of its better Animes like Ghost in the Shell.
0375414053|3.0|A very funny novel about a high powered married working mother of two children trying to balance work and motherhood. It is a very humorous but thoughtful tale of the daily trials of being female in the workplace and the key decision maker at home. I laughed out loud at times. Though the main chracter lives in London, her tale is universal. Very good beach/vacation reading. I read it in 2 days!
0884271536|3.0|I got this book for my &quot;excellent work&quot;. Initially I thought it was going to be boring, but it turned out it is reasonably well written and interesting. However, at times it is too slow and makes you realise why there are all these management summaries out there. The concept of &quot;critical chain&quot; itself is quite useful, if implemented properly. However, I don't think many companies will be able to do this, because of the temptation to remove the buffer time after the new estimates are made, and the fact that people will know this in advance, and still secretly add buffer time of their own to the individual steps. This is what happened where I worked, anyway.
0156027321|5.0|This story is so well written and so well researched that you could not expect more from an author. The &quot;Life of PI&quot; is a charming briliantly written story of a young boy's survival on a lifeboat, after a shipwreck, somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. What makes it so interesting is that he is sharing the lifeboat with an adult Begal Tiger. The author introduces techniques of survival on the water that is  imaginative as well as brillant.  Not only does Pi have to worry about obtaining food and water for himself, he has to also do this for the tiger or else the tiger may make Pi his lunch.  There is also a fascinating journey through several different religious worships and their conflicting views.<BR>A really must read.

B00006G9KW|5.0|I would guess the best I can say is when I see Follett I know it will be a good read. This was outstanding with all the elements of Politics(cold war) espionage, mystery, intrigue and all the elements to keep you finding time to continue reading. One of my favorite Authors and I will continue to read all that he writes.

B00009TB5G|1.0|In the fellowship, when PJ and co. changed things to be different from the way that tolkien wrote the story and least it made sense in the context of the movie.  In the two towers, all of the deviations from the book are not only stupid, but pointless.  From the Aaragorn fighting with wargs and falling off cliffs to the ents, the oldest and wisest race in middle earth getting outsmarted and going way out of character by making a decision and changing their minds to the rediculous comic relief of Gimli (and I'm not even mentioning how they butcher faramir), these changes only served to hurt the story.  Even when they follow along with the storyline, all of tolkiens magic is ripped away but the complete lack of subtlety.  Theoden wasn't possesed by saruman and by making him so it robbed so much from what is otherwise a beautiful story.  I'm sorry but after the amazing job they did on the fellowship, I can't help but be enormously dissapointed with the hollywood ... that I saw in the two towers and surprised by how many people think that this is actually a good movie!<BR>It's sad how easy it is for hollywood to rob people of artistic integrity for the sake of maximizing profits (it's like George Lucas and Peter Jackson got together to write Gimli and Jar Jar's characters at the same time)
B00008PW3Q|4.0|There are really three phases of Fleetwood Mac:  The Peter Green period (awesome blues work), the Bob Welch period (short-lived and largely forgettable), and the Buckingham-Nicks period.  I always felt that Lindsay Buckingham was a consummate songwriter and arranger, and many of his songs have tickled and surprised my ears over the years. The best songs on &quot;Tusk&quot; belonged to him, and that's true in this album as well.  With Stevie Nicks, I've run hot-and-cold, but here she turns in some of her best songwriting in years.  Contrary to what I've heard elsewhere, this doesn't come across as a &quot;tired&quot;-sounding album at all, but contains some of the most spirited, catchy music they've done in a long while.  True, Christine McVie is gone, but to me she's not really conspicuous in her absence (though she does lend her vocal talent to some tracks).  And Fleetwood and John McVie are basically reduced creatively to the rhythm section.  But this is a Buckingham-Nicks album all the way, and one of their best.  Recommended tracks: &quot;What's the World Coming To&quot;, &quot;Illume&quot;, &quot;Red Rover&quot;, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, and &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;.
B00008DDXL|4.0|Once again, we find Harry Potter stuck in his room on Privett Drive with his Aunt &amp; Uncle.  Hedwig is going stir crazy and Harry is rather upset that no one has sent him any letters all summer.  Enter Dobby the House Elf.  He comes to warn Harry not to go back to Hogworts for the new school year because bad things will happen.<br />This year at Hogwarts snakes talk and Harry communicates with them.  From duelling clubs to rogue Bludgers, it's a year of adventure and danger when bloody writing on a wall announces: &quot;The Chamber of Secrets has been opened&quot;. To save Hogwarts will require all of Harry, Ron and Hermione's magical abilities and courage in this spellbinding sequel.<br />The first time I heard Ronald Weasley speak, I sort of chuckled and thought &quot;somebody hit puberty&quot;.  What a great movie!!
0345404475|5.0|This was a really emotional read -- and fun. The story is pretty simple, a futuristic bounty hunter Rick Deckard is commissioned to \\"retire\\" six Nexus-6 androids. The Nexus-6 androids are remarkably human and it is only through the so-called Voight-Kampf test that Deckard can truly tell the androids from the humans. The Voight-Kampf tests androids for empathic responses; that is, the androids will respond callously to the test's life-death questions, whereas humans tend to respond with empathy regarding the destruction of life.<br />Herein lies the novel's poignant irony: Deckard is a human, and he's on a mission to \\"retire\\" the androids using this test. So the question becomes, Who is really human, who really has compassion?<br />I really enjoyed \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" but it is for a very different reason than say a Michael Crichton or Larry Niven novel. Dick's science is a little screwy/funny, but his heart was _so_ in the right place. Reading a Philip K. Dick novel is a little like looking at the wildest of Van Gogh's paintings, you know, where you can feel the desparation in every dash of paint. Technically it looks like the work of a teenager, but there's a grown man's heart on the line underneath the text of this story. And _that_ is why the next science fiction novel I read will most likely be a Philip K. Dick novel.<br />Stacey
B000059ZT4|5.0|Another Bob Marley cd with good sound quality so it's inevitabley going to be good so buy this if you want top quality reggae.
B000067DNC|4.0|I buy the first season and get hoocked I love the series I've been awaiting this since the first box set, especially because y promoted to every and each one of my friends but i was very dissapointed when i realize seeing it that has NOT SPANISH SUBTITLES LIKE THE FIRST ONE.<BR>Why MGM do this?? Why the discrimination.<BR>The series will be Perfect the only problem is that doen not have subtitles in spanish WHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYY????????, having you 35 millions of latin people and all the millions that live all around th globe??
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is definatley one of the best albums brought about in the 70's along with anything by Bob Marley. The cd takes on a fusion feel as there are alot of influences in this cd it's just a matter of spotting some of them such as latin, blues and aventgarde. I love the reggae tracks on this aswell such as guns of Brixton and even when you would think you would get tired of  the track London calling it still sounds good. This is one of few albums that deserves the title classic. I also liked the clash for there diversity they did'nt stick with the standard punk genre they explored with all sorts of other genres and included elements from other cultures which i respected though you do get more of that with Joe Strummers later solo project which i would recommened to Clash fans of London Calling. London calling starts off as good as it finishes from the punk classic Londo calling to the last note on the poppy disco type song of Train in Vein so what other way can you recommened one of most creative bands of the 70's pinnacle albums.
0345448898|5.0|for those of you who think that all seriously religious-minded people are too close-minded for these books and that 6th graders can't handle this stuff... you're way too wrong.<br />i consider myself a committed christian, and i personally didn't take this trilogy as offensive.  it's a story.  it's not religious or anti-religious.. it's just philosophical and complex.  it makes you think, and it fully engages you to the \\"war\\".  the ideas in this book are seemingly too far-fetched yet basic to think that Pullman is trying to make a religious statement here.<br />and as for the age thing.. i read the Golden Compass the summer after 6th grade, and the other two books as soon as they came out.  i have repeatedly read the books since (it's been 6 years) and i can't get enough of it, like many of my other friends who also started reading this trilogy when i did.  So many of you (mainly adults, i should think) are comparing this trilogy to HARRY POTTER... that is a CRIME.  the writing style of harry potter itself is childish, and though it MIGHT prove to be just as complex as His Dark Materials, it is not as condensed or mind-challenging.  the characters of His Dark Materials also exceed the characters of Harry Potter.  (i just read the 5th book, and it obviously lacks the necessary character development that you would think would come with an 800+ page book.)<br />the 3rd book is by far the best since it ties everything in together.  the 1st is great for pure adventure thrills.  Pullman is one of the few authors that truly know how to write a series. (and yes, Rowling knows how to do it too.. i think.)  you plan the entire series out before writing it.  authors that try to ADD on will always lack something, either the little foreshadowing hints or a more-than-satisfying storyline.<br />get the full set.  you WILL read the entire trilogy and you'd want to read it repeatedly 'till you have to buy another set to replace the faded pages.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I really liked the idea of this movie and with usually liking this kind of genre i was excpecting this to be a good film and was not disappointed. It really makes you put your self in Tom Hank's characters shoes and imagine what it would be like 4 years by yourself with a volleyball for a friend and no real identity it's an essential film to view which i would recommend to anyone. Robert Zemekis could not have chosen a better actor than Tom Hanks for this roll he delivers a great performance and for alot of the film is acting in soliloquy which shows how good a performance he really gives on this film. Castaway is a story of hope in dispair and is not pretentious to this kind of desert island film, it's a good film that you should see at least twice.
0792846443|4.0|I thought this was a great movie.  I read the Stephen King novel first, and the movie lived up to my expectations.
B00000FBRE|5.0|This is very emotive punk music that really gets under your skin at times and others just rocks (hurry up and wait & agent oranges everything turns grey). Lets talk about feelings is only short (25 mins long) but it's the quality of the music not the quantity and is definatley worth considering and the lyrics are amazing so pick this up if your looking for a good melodic punk cd. You can tell that Lagwagon are good by just hearing the intensity in this album and the chord progression really works theres also some pretty strange harmonics that sound great but are a mystery as to how you get them well to me at least, this id a great melodic punk album from one of the greatest punk bands around at the present.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce is definately doing her thing on her debut CD.  It has a lot of banging hip-hop songs as well as slow songs and she has a voice like no other.  She is going to be around for a long time.  I am already looking forward to her next CD.  You go girl :)
B000060P79|5.0|i bought this cd in a whim. i had only heard &quot;addicted&quot; and my cousin told me that his friend really liked it. i figured why not and went and picked it up. it rocks. every song (to me) is a winner. a great mix of Good Charlotte, Blink 182 and Green Day. i highly recommend this cd to fans of the previously mentioned band. catchy beats, great guitar riffs (although some ripping solos would be cool every now and then) and talented vocals make this album what it is. a damn good one.
B000002UJQ|3.0|I find it appalling that I'm stupid, don't like intelligent music, and can't grasp these &quot;complex soundscapes&quot; just because I don't like this album.  I'm intelligent, and I enjoy meaningful music, but just because it's well put together and intelligent doesn't mean I should like it, or that it's even good music.  I find most of it boring.  Someone mentioned I'd like it on the 72nd listen...well why should I have to listen to an album that I don't like 72 times before I like it?  It's ridiculous.  I will give Radiohead credit for being the artists that they are, but it's nothing new and it's nothing particularly amazing.  Since I don't like it, you guys are calling me the one who must have a narrow vision of music, but many of you also seem to think that OK Computer is simply revolutionary.  Obviously, Radiohead is the only think you've heard outside of the mainstream.<br />That being said, I will admit that Karma Police and Let Down keep me coming back, but the rest of the album is tiresome and bland.  Kid A really impressed me, and upon reading the reviews, most people seemed to think OK Computer was as much of a masterpiece.  It however, is not.  I found Kid A to be much more refreshing and interactive.  OK Computer is a wonderful blend, but it's blended too much.  And whatever it is that is supposed to be so emotional is monotonous.  I believe a lot of this hype is coming from people who *want* to like it.  Check out some other music.  A few beeps, clicks, and sweeps are nothing new, and a lot of other people did it a lot better.<br />Save yourself from the outrageous prices and simply download Karma Police and Let Down, lest you be &quot;let down&quot;.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Of any musical, from '42nd Street' to 'Cats', I have never seen any more amazing musical brought to the big screen. The lighting, music, sexy costumes, great cast, and dance routines, all of it is great. It stars Renee Zellweger as Roxie, the want-to-be star in a Chicago club. Then there's Catherine Zeta-Jones portraying Velma Kelly, an established star put in jail for the murder of her sister and husband. Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the best lawyer in town, never lost a case. And then there is Mama (Queen Latifah) the matron. It starts out with \\"All That Jazz\\" where Roxie sees Velma sing/dance. She then goes home with her friend who she thinks will get her into the bigtime when she shoots him. She ends up in jail and meets Velma there for the murder of her husband and sister. Once in jail, she meets Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton who likes her and says that ...\\"when she's good to mama...mama's good to you.\\" Roxie hears all of the ladies stories from the Cell Block Tango...like \\"oh, he ran into my knife ten times\\" or \\"you know some men just can't hold their arsenic!\\" Roxie learns that if she doesnt win the case, she will be hung unless...unless she has Billy Flynn. Roxie's devoted husband Amos (John C. Reily) pays for the lawyer and after Velma's attention in all the news, everyone is now onto Roxie and her case. Everyone loves Roxie! The trial is set and after all they worked out, they got it good. After she is found innocent some pictures are shot until another woman shoots her husband and Roxie is old news. Velma then comes to Roxie and offers her an act with her and then together, they are hot stuff...\\"Nowadays!!!!\\" From Zeta-Jones to Reily or to Queen Latifah, all of them have talent and it is no wonder it swooped \\"Best Just-About-Everything\\" at the 2003 Academy Awards. I have seen it three times and I will have it pre-ordered with Amazon.com! CHECK IT OUT after all...\\"it's all...that...JAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!\\"
0783225903|5.0|The opening frames of Brazil contain the provocative words, &quot;Somewhere in the 20th Century.&quot;  It's a reference to how the setting and costumes combine futuristic and retro imagery, and also to the 20th Century ideology of increasing bureaucratization, impersonalization, and paranoia.  But as a wise person once said, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, which is the situation of Sam Lowry, Brazil's likable but doomed hero.  In a winning performance--he's in just about every scene, a physically and emotionally demanding role--Jonathan Pryce embodies director Terry Gilliam's everyman worldview.  Sam is determined to pursue the woman of his dreams even if it interferes with the brutal efficiency that prevails in this dystopian society.  It's a movie of many moods, and they shift abruptly.  One minute you're disturbed, the next you're laughing, sometimes it's disorienting, but Gilliam, who also co-wrote the brilliant script, pulls it off.  Brazil put him on the map as a great director and he probably won't top it.  But he didn't do it alone.  As said before, Pryce is wonderful, as is Robert DeNiro in a sly, strange cameo role, Ian Holm as Sam's sniveling, manipulative, but somehow sympathetic boss, Katherine Helmond as Sam's vain mother (interesting Oedipal stuff going on), Jim Broadbent as Dr. Jaffe the plastic surgeon who caters to the vanity of Sam's mom, Bob Hoskins as a pigheaded vengeful repairman who gets drowned in a rather interesting way, and a host of lesser known actors in juicy character roles, a real gallery of grotesques.  But it's Michael Palin, Gilliam's old Monty Python partner, who likely makes the major impression--a truly chilling villain, family man who loves his work as a state torturer, and casually discusses his techniques while playing with his toddler daughter (whose name he can't remember).  I can't describe how visually stunning Brazil is, you have to see for yourself.  But don't forget that the script is as impressive as the images, and you might need to see/hear the film more than once to digest the whole feast.  Repeated viewings are rewarded, especially in these days of the war on terrorism.  Parts of the movie may remind you of the government's &quot;rescue&quot; of Elian Gonzalez; others will make you think you're watching a public service announcement for the Office of Homeland Security.  No matter how you slice it, this is a tour de force for all involved, and as DeNiro says, &quot;We're all in it together!&quot;
B000099T2L|5.0|I picked up Beyonce Knowles debut solo album thinking it would not be like one of her Destiny's Child trio songs but...I was sure wrong! She has been doing great--vocals, writing, producing, and acting--Her hit &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; featuring Jay-Z is a great hit. Not a bad CD for young ones...no lanuage issues at all! She's been around on the album with artists like Missy Elliott and Sean Paul. I'm looking foward for more from her in the future!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The second installment of Tolkiens classic trilogy is brought to magnificent life in this, Peter Jackson's forray into the world of Middle Earth.  It's worth remembering that this is an ADAPTATION of Tolkiens work, and fans of the book will be quick to spot some key differences...most notably the ending, with postpones Sam and Frodo's arachnophobic encounters until the third movie.  While book-spods will probably baulk at the various changes they might at least concede the necessity of modifying the film for the screen.<br />The Two Towers marks the commencement of open battle between the shattered alliance of elves and men, and the dark forces of Saruman and Sauron, the former played to corrupt perfection by the indomitable Christopher Lee.  The army of Orthanc, portrayed in clanking, snarling digital splendor, marches against the rag-tag human army, fleeing to apparant safety at Helm's Deep, an ancient stronghold.  Meanwhile Frodo and Sam stumble painfully towards Mordor, helped and hindered by One-ring obsessed Gollum, voiced by Andy Sirkis and realised in more CG perfection.  In the third strand of the story Merry and Pippin, in the clutches of Saruman's Uruk scouts, find themselves alone in the Fanghorn forest, with some unlikely allies.<br />This is an absolutely massive story, compressed artfully into an equally epic movie.  Yes, there's been some snips, cuts, changes and adaptations made, but at the end of the day this is still a worthy homage to Tolkiens vision, and a damn fine adventure.  The cast list glitters and shines with quality actors...Elijah Wood continues to impress as the wide-eyed Frodo; grizzly Viggo Mortensen is dashing and soulful as Aragorn, with eagle-eyed Orlando Bloom and sturdy John-Ryhs Davies in fine supporting roles.  The list goes on and on, much as it did for Fellowship Of the Ring.<br />With plenty of wonderful special effects, a gripping score and many hours of fantastic special features, this DVD will one day be hailed as a third of the greatest movie of all time.  Highly recommended.d of the greatest movie of all time.  Highly recommended.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Having been a fan of the ever-so-talented Mr Williams sice his teeny bopping boyband days, you might say my love of Robbie is bordering on the obsessive! Rob's latest offering - Escapology was not what i expected based on his previous material. It is an absolute gem, featuring awesome tracks such as his new UK single Something Beautiful, Feel, Monsoon, Sexed Up, Love Somebody (my personal fave with Rob stretching his vocals to the limit creating a very powerful ballad), Handsome Man (another gem which allows rob's famous irony to creep in, paying homage to the many \\"sexiest male\\" and \\"most fanciable male\\" awards that he has won over the years), Come Undone ( a raw insight into Rob's previous lifestyle of alcohol and drug addiction), Hot Fudge ( i think this was scrapped from the US version but its a real catchy, upbeat track which I think will be his next UK single after Something Beautiful. Worth checking out) and finally Nan's song ( a heart warming tribute to his late nan who he adored. The fact that its the only track on the album which rob has written himself makes it even more precious.) Rob tackled this album with a new approach. He recorded it like it was a live show and made it clear he wanted no overdubbing to polish it up. He even plays the drums and the guitar on some of the tracks and I believe the rawness of this album is what makes it better than the others. Robbie is one of the best entertainers around at the moment. He is full of charisma, charm and has an amazing sense of humour. He has an exceptional talent and I am amazed that America has not embraced it the way Europe and the Middle East have. I think you can only really appreciate what Robbie is about and how much his music and his fans mean to him after you have seen him perform live. He has so much love to give and I just wish America would give him a fair go.
0316666343|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2/3 of this haunting, well-paced novel. It begins as a suspense filled mystery in which a family, torn apart by the death of the oldest daughter attempts to discover her killer, heal their own wounds, and move on with their lives. However, two thirds of the way through the book, the tone changes completely and the mystery is, for the most part, dropped. Instead the story follows the family members as they grow and change in the ten years following the daughter's murder, and this was a far less compelling story to me. Regardless, the novel is a page-turner and an emotional roller coaster for the reader, and I admire Sebold's skill at bringing what you might think would be a cliched plot contrivance to an engaging unfolding. The narrator is ever present in the lives of her friends and family and so the reader gets an incredibly personal and detailed account of the events of their lives and the inner-workings of their minds. This book is a favorite of middle and high school students and I now know why. It is a book in which an adolescent watches how her effect on her loved ones plays out over time despite her absence, sort of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; redux, and what adolescent has not thought about that at some point? I look forward to more from Sebold after this promising debut.
0066620996|3.0|This fluently written book aims to offer insight into what makes the top companies tick and reach that level above and beyond being simply \\"good\\". Eleven such superstar companies are singled out according to 5 years worth of research -- Abbot Labs, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly-Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Philip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo -- on the basis of 15-year stock returns. <br />Which is one metric. It may be instructive to note that Gillette, one of the Great firms, is trading at the same stock price as it was in 1995, and went through a pretty lame patch of 4-5 years just recently until it was saved by a doyen CEO. Wells Fargo, despite its Norwest acquisition still remains no.5 in its category. <br />We are offered the following insights about most effective leaders: <br />- Best leaders are not high profile folk but subdued, humble yet focused people who get results. Sure, but same could also be said of the oppposite personality. Examples of vivacious/outspoken yet successful CEOs abound: Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Jack Welch etc.<br />- Great leaders are supposed to believe in teamwork (Nokia's boss, Jorma Ollila, and his preachings of putting teamwork before individual effort are cited). Excuse me if this hackneyed mantra fails to tickle my fancies. <br />Apart from the above insightful analysis, we are taken through a whole text of redundant spin on how companies need to focus on their \\"key profitability ratio\\" and hone it down to succeed. Advice of this nature that asks companies to focus sounds quite ordinary and unimaginative, so a parable from Aesop's Fables is thrown in -- the \\"HedgeHog versus Fox\\" -- a hedgehog knows ONE thing well and excels at it, while a fox runs around seeking many targets but never learns. We should of course be like the hedgehog.<br />Firstly, this swansong of \\"focus\\" is painfully cliche. Secondly, it assumes that business context is stagnant, which is anything but the reality. What happens when Kentucky Fried Chicken runs out of favor with a populace that is becoming health conscious? Or, what happens when a new generation requires MORE than one type of jeans? (This put Levis into its deep market share woes as recently as the late 90s while Lee Cooper and Calvin Klein made significant inroads into the teen denim markets, Levis was caught sleeping with its errant strategy to focus on its 501s).<br />I have difficulty believing that the book stands up to all its rave reviews. At best, this is just ONE perspective about SOME companies based on ONE statistic, the data for which were collected and analyzed POST-HOC (known as \\"posthoc bias\\" to those in the know). If you are expecting to come away with any pearls of wisdom about effective leadership or corporate success, you may be disappointed.
0887306101|5.0|I'm the Market Strategist for a NYC Investment Bank (billions under management). Someone gave me this book when I first got into the industry a decade ago; I find myself rereading it every 5 years. <br />I highly recommend it to anyone who is involved in the markets. Simply stated, this is THE book for anyone who wants to learn about trading or investing -- It is simply a must read. <br />What's so utterly compelling about the interviews is how consistent the themes are that arise from so many different traders; This is true regardless of the markets they work in (commodities, equities, currencies, bonds) or the style they employ (technical, macro-economic, fundamental, quantitative). <br />The basic concepts revealed by the Wizards are Discipline, Capital Preservation, Risk Management, Individual Responsibility, Flexibility, Intellectual Honesty and Consistency. Please note that these ideas have nothing to do with coming across a hot tip, or getting a big IPO allocation, or chasing the &quot;darling of the day.&quot; It's especially relevant, given some of the speculative excesses of the most recent (March '03) rally. <br />This book should cause all investors, both novice and experienced, to step back and consider their strategies and methodologies. These are much more important than finding the next &quot;flavor of the month.&quot; This is especially true now that a new group of stock pickers have been inundating the airwaves.<br />7/21/03
B00004VVNB|5.0|LOGAN'S RUN is a thinking person's sci fi outing with all the trappings of 70s cinema.  Michael York and Farrah - the names alone tell you this is the height of 70s chic.  Unisex haridos and costumes, location shooting in a MALL, models of a city and its transportation that aren't going to fool anyone, and gorgeous matte paintings that won an OSCAR.  All wrapped around a cautionary tale of technology gone awry in a culture that only values beauty and youth.<br />The story revolves around domed cities of the future where people live after a nuclear catastrophe ravages the ecosystem.  Population control is a concern, and the solution is a 30 year lifespan for all citizens.  This is enforced by a custom called CAROUSEL where one hopes to &quot;RENEW&quot; but seems to just explode in a firey death.  Michael York plays Logan, a sandman who is assigned to find out what is happening to runners - people who try to escape CAROUSEL at 30 and live on.  It's a cult classic that came out a year before STAR WARS, and the odd thing is look at the effects.  STAR WARS really made lightyears jumps in how Sci Fi looked!<br />The DVD is a wonderful bargain.  You get featurettes, trailers, and a commentary with directors, designers, and Michael York himself.  Oddly he takes credit for Farrah Fawcett's career - he claims to have discovered her.  It's so much fun to listen to!<br />Differences from the book?  In the novel people died at 21, and they were just sent to crematoriums (no eerie CAROUSEL!), and to escape Logan plans to board a spaceship!  Seems the whole planet is run by machines.  Many differences were made from the novel because of technical concerns.  York was too old to be 21, the domed cities were easier to film, and CAROUSEL was a spectacular way of dying!  I've heard rumors of a remake - evn one where Leo was involved as Logan, but nothing concrete.  Until then enjoy the 70s camp!
B00005JM1Y|3.0|I have often admired Rowan Atkinson in my living room. He has a riveting presence and is quite talented in the slapstick manner of a Charlie Chaplin. Unfortunately, the same magic is not evident when transferred onto the large theater screen. Atkinson does not suffice in the lead role of Johnny English. This James Bond spoof fails every time John Malkovich is not included in a scene. The latter actor portraying the laughably sinister French businessman, Pascal Sauvage, who wants to become King of England is hysterical and provides the right type of balance for this role. Natalie Imbruglia does a serviceable job as Lorna Campbell, the love interest of our not too bright secret agent.<br />The scatological jokes were over the top and I personally could have done without these yucky attempts at humor. Also, Johnny English is far too slow paced and is about eight minutes too long. I can only give this film three stars. You might wish to wait until it is released in dvd format.
B000099T2L|4.0|This time around beyonce is the last to drop a solo cd of the DC3 and as expected.... is doing very good with it. Without all the extra hype and media play aside....is it really good? At first listen I wasent too impressed except for a few really good tracks. After a second and third listen I really started to get into it. This is another good example of not letting the single fool you into thinking the whole album is the same way. Overall this is a very soulful album taking it back to the old school R+B a lil bit. If you are nto into that then you might have to listen a few times but everything was well written .....she came a long way. Now to the songs....whats good?<br />Crazy in Love - Hottest single of the summer so far.<BR>Naughty Girl - Tight use of Sample<BR>Baby Boy - Good collabo with sean paul.<BR>Yes - Very tight slow jam.<BR>Signs - Missy helps sum up the different ways of the zodiac.<BR>The closer I get to you - Nice duet with luther on this remake.<BR>Dangerously in Love - Best slow jam on cd. (should have been the version she sung on SNL)  <BR>Gift from Virgo - very laid back slow jam. (Old school feel)<BR>Daddy - Most soulful track on the album. (Nice song)<br />Overall Beyonce has improved a lot vocally and lyrically and has showed she can put on a show as well as deliver the music. With such a good start you can expect more good things to come but for now 'Dangeruosly in Love' is how you have to take it.<br />Get it!
B000060P79|3.0|I purchased this album as an alternative to Good Charlotte. They do sound somewhat similar to GC, but Pierre Bouvier's voice sounds like he hasn't puberty, and it really gets on your nerves. I really don't think these guys can be considered &quot;punk&quot; because they sing with almost no anger. Many of the song are childish pop songs like #5, #8, #9, #10, and #12. I think a 10 year old could write most of these lyrics, and they have the same guitar riffs. It sounds like every song repeats itself. I do have to give them credit for &quot;You Don't Mean Anything&quot; which is a really good song. I probably like it because it includes Joel Madden of GC. I also do like &quot;Worst Day Ever&quot;, but besides that I really don't think this album is worth putting money into if you're a hardcore punk fan. If you're a punk-pop fan then you should consider putting this into your album, but make sure to check out both of Good Charlotte's albums.
6305251134|5.0|Excellent! Great literature, turned in to a great picture.
0345441184|5.0|A book like this comes around once in a lifetime.  I am an avid reader of historical fiction and this is my all time favorite book.  Definitely the best telling of the King Arthurian legend ever.  The descriptions are so rich and the characters are so realistic, it is truly mesmerizing.  The magic entwined in the writing is almost palpable.  The characters become friends that you don't want to let go when you are done reading.  You will shed many tears and find yourself laughing out loud at times.  If you have read other Marion Zimmer Bradley books and were not impressed, do not be put off .... this book is her masterpiece.
B00007J4SI|4.0|A fine, inexpensive 5-CD set--but it's NOT the complete non-sonata piano works.  For the 3 Etudes op. 65, 2 Poems op. 71, poem Vers la Flamme op. 72, 2 Dances op. 73, and 5 Preludes op. 74, you need the accompanying 2-CD set SCRIABIN:  COMPLETE SONATAS, which consists of the 10 numbered piano sonatas, 2 posthumous piano sonatas, and opp. 65 and 71-4.
0385504209|4.0|I was loaned this book by a friend and I am now buying it so that I can lend it to my friends and relatives.  It is definitely worth it.  Not being a big fan of murder mysteries, I was apprehensive about reading this book when it was recommended to me.  But since I was assured it also crossed genres into historical fiction (my true love) I decided to give it a try.  I was hooked within the first 10 pages.  The romanticized descriptions of the Louvre and other museums/landmarks made me want to give Paris another chance after having had a bad experience there a few summers ago.  The story is fascinating, the well-researched history is intriguing, the pace is energizing, and the characters are stereotypical but adorable nonetheless.  Buy it or borrow it ... it is a great read.
B00003CXB2|4.0|As the editor and publisher of Davidlean.com I can say with a high degree of confidence that Lawrence of Arabia remains one of Lean's most treasured films--and with good reason.  It is a film that can be analyzed and appreciated on all artistic fronts: an exceptional screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson; ground breaking and stunning cinematography by Freddy Young; flawless editing by Anne V. Coates; and one of the great scores from any film by Maurice Jarre.  The film's placement as one of the greatest films ever made is not hyperbole, it is truly an original film that will never be equaled.<br />Unfortunately I cannot recommend the deluxe edition released on DVD despite its wealth of additional features.  The transfer in this DVD is terribly flawed.  The Main Titles are smeared and the color is off in many of the scenes. Additionally, Columbia decided to fiddle with the audio tracks by re-editing or remixing a few important scenes.  These include the infamous scene of Lawrence walking atop the railroad cars, and the scene right before the intermission as Lawrence is walking back towards the officers to be congratulated.  Both contain misplaced audio cues that, had David Lean still been alive, would have endured a thorough verbal lashing from him.  They are ill timed and poorly done. (The correct audio cues can be found on the Portuguese audio track.) Given the film's history of tampering, it is appalling that the studio continues to \\"mess\\" with the film's contents rather than release the film as Lean desired.  Hopefully the next (third) release of the film as a SuperBit edition will correct these errors (I have been assured by someone close to this production that they will be).
0440133688|5.0|I've read this book twice. Once before starting medical school and now a second time just completing my residency at the House of God West (HOGW).  In any highly stressful environment, be it combat, firefighting, law enforcement and (it would appear) delivering mail, people use essentially the same defense mechanisms to deal with physical and psychological discomfort.  HOG does a pretty good job of describing how house staff in a teaching hospital deal with their daily grind.    Everything in this book is as true in managed care as it was in the transition years of the seventies.  I assure you, there is still sex in the hospital. I don't know what happenned to the reviewers that deny this, but it was certainly experienced by me and my cohort of residents.  Nurses, medical students and house staff didn't suddenly stop liking sex when the 70s ended.  There does seem to be less smoking than is described in the book, however. Go figure.    The reviews of this book by medical students and even pre-meds are sometimes funnier than the book itself.  Honestly, medical students are still on the outside looking in and have about as much place commenting on whether the experiences described in this book depict intern life... as an actor playing an intern on ER.  Wait until you've had the call pager for a month straight, then write your review.    I can't necessarily recommend this book to laypeople; it's not a work of art.  But, every single college student filling out those applications and studying for that MCAT should be *required* to read this book.    And to those laypeople who are somehow shocked by the goings on at a teaching hospital:  Just make sure you get that DNI/DNR order straightened out before you too become a gome.
B00005JLSE|5.0|If you look at this movie from an entirely moral perspective there is no doubt that you will find the subject and plot-line thoroughly unappealing...however if you look at the work as a whole--the cinematography, the choreography, the acting, the singing, and the dancing, you will truly appreciate it for what it is, a work of art.  Having not seen Moulin Rouge I can make no comparison between the two, and don't want to anyway.  If you call Chicago a \\"New Age\\" musical about the doldrums, downfall and moral degredation of our society you are forgetting that it is a Broadway musical and has been on stage for more than 25 years.<br />Being a dancer myself the dance scenes in the film are amazingly choreographed, and performed just as well.  To think that in three weeks off of dance I am already out of shape, and then to look at Catherine Zeta-Jones hit those dance numbers home amazes me.  She's incredible, as is Richard Gere, and Renee Zellweger.  I only have ONE complaint.  In \\"The Gun\\" the reporter who sings- I forget her name- tries to do an Entrechat (ballet) and it looks HORRIBLE because her legs are completely turned in.  <br />Well, I hope that you rent this movie when it comes out, not just to see a great movie, but to get exposed to what the world of the Peforming Arts really is like...It's a DOG EAT DOG world...
B0000524CY|5.0|Ther are alot of great, unforgettable horror films out there that still burn in the back of our minds to this day.  But THE EXORCIST stands out among all the rest.  It's the first horror film that really focused itself on the Catholic faith rather than focusing on scaring the audience.  What I really liked about it was that it didn't just jump to the possession of Regan McNiel; it actually took lots of time before that to develop a plot and give the audience a background history on Father Merin and Father Karras. I get annoyed at the fact that younger kids who are looking for \\"a really scary movie\\" always turn to THE EXORCIST and when they start the movie, they can't sit through this kind of plot development. (i.e. my pre-teen cousins)  They just want to get to the possession and don't care about anything else.  Don't get me wrong, I found myself at times waiting to be scared.  But when the horror begins, IT HITS YOU HARD AND NEVER LETS UP!!!!!!!!!  It really never lets you go!  I usually can take any horror film on Earth, but with this one, especially towards the end, it really started to freak me out and I almost didn't want to watch it anymore.  But, if you want to be freaked, definately see it.  You can even buy before renting it if you want, trust me.
B000099T2L|1.0|Check, the only, only, ONLY, and I mean it, O N L Y, good thing about this whole cd is Jigga's verse on Crazy In Love.  Not even Outkast's Big Boi was as good as I spected.

B00005K3NR|4.0|CARRIE is definately a true Stephen King classic; good acting, one of the creepiest films of the '70s, good special effects and nice gore.  It is a little overrated, but not that much.  It follows the novel quite accurately, and anyone who liked the novel will definately like the movie.  Also, the chemistry between Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek was dead-on!
B00002E233|4.0|&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; is one of those monster flicks that makes an attempt at being an intelligent man's horror film.  The genetically-altered, Alzheimer cure-all mako shark idea was a good one, and a little more unique than most creature films, but in essence this is a man-screws-with-nature-nature-screws-back sort of tale.  There are a couple of suspenseful moments, and the makos look great throughout the majority of the film.  Other reviewers accuse the acting as being standard and weightless, but remember that this is a creature feature and the first rule of this genre is that the creature is the star.  I found nothing terribly wrong about the acting, and much like &quot;Anaconda,&quot; this film has a token rapper(LL Cool J) who does a good job.  The rest of the cast is fairly standard, but none of their performances are that bad.  Samuel L. Jackson gives &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; a solid actor, and he seemed to enjoy his time on screen in this film.  Thomas Jane is another standout who plays the heroic lead, although little is left for our hero to save.  Saffron Burrows does an excellent job as the good-meaning, yet slightly mad scientist who you really want to see get bit by a mako.<br />Overall, this is an above-average flick.  It isn't as cheesy as &quot;Lake Placid,&quot; and it doesn't make the sharks quite as smart as the raptors of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; fame, but it takes parts of both of these films and combines them with a little suspense and terror a la &quot;Jaws&quot; and serves up a fish dinner that just about anyone can enjoy.<br />Also, notice the nod given to &quot;Jaws&quot; during Jackson's initial landing at Aquatica.(Hint:  Check that license plate)

B000002HK4|5.0|A Change of Seasons could possibly be the best Dream Theater songs ever. It is certainly one of the best songs ever. The song A Change of Seasons is the best representation of the uniqueness and virtuosity of Dream Theater. It is a must have.
B00005JMC6|4.0|Whale rider is a moving and inspirational movie set in everyday New Zealand and based on Maori legend. Originally adapted from WIti Ihimaera's awarded winning novel and directed by Niki Caro it's the story about a young girl named Pai who is descendant from a long line of chiefs and must overcome all odds to prove her destiny.<BR> The story takes place in the little town of Whangara, which is surrounded by tradition and mythology. The locals of Whangara belief that their ancestors came to New Zealand on a canoe. One man Paikea got thrown overboard but got carried back to shore on the back of a whale.<BR> The main character Pai, lives with her grandparents Koro and Flowers. Her mum and twin brother died when Pai was born and her father left to go overseas. This leads Koro in search for a male heir and Pai fighting to be accepted as the rightful heir.<BR> The film has a good message behind it and I thought it was unique and made the story more interesting the way they combined the outcome with the whale tale. Parts of the story were very deep and emotional and other parts were high-spirited.<BR> The setting was in New Zealand and the camera gives the viewer a good view of their beaches and their village. I thought that the setting was appropriate and well detailed especially the wood carved meetinghouse. I thought the music had cultural significance.<BR> The characters were good and the actors were very believable but I think that Keisha Castle-Hughes (Pai) did an even better job. Her character was very emotional and would have been really tough to play but she plays her part so well.<BR> All in all this movie is definitely worth watching, it's a realistic and emotional plot that all ages can enjoy.

B00005JM09|4.0|This movie is quite entertaining in its own right without reference as the second sequel.

B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson...simple man...simple songs.  What a guy!!  I can't believe that someone could improve on their first masterpiece.  Jack has done it.  He is a talented surfer, but seems to be having a lot of fun with his guitar and his soulful tunes.  I was immediately struck by Taylor,Gone, and Holes to Heaven.  All the tracks were amazing though.  I even got my mom (a die hard for R&amp;B), and my Grandma (open but not always willing music fan) to say &quot;this is great!&quot;  I love to hear this guy sing and play and I can't wait to be stunned release after release by this brilliant artist.
7119005901|5.0|I ordered this set, and unlike a previous reader, it was not bilingual, but all in English.  <br />One great thing about this set is the notes in the back of the book.  It explains mysterious quotes, historical figures, and also symbolistic characters that contribute to the development of the Three Kingdoms.<br />One question, for you all:  In the notes section, it usually comments on &quot;TS.&quot;  For example, &quot;In TS (pg 71), Zhao ZiLong said, ....&quot;  What does the TS stand for? I understand it is a book that they are reffering to, but what is the official title and who wrote it?
0066214122|4.0|As with many Michael Crichton tales, when reading Prey you'd be well advised to switch the brain into neutral and simply enjoy the rollercoaster ride for the fun of it.  Crichton is nothing if not an effective and entertaining storyteller.  Crichton wastes no time with character development beyond a few charicature sketches (ie: family-man, company-man, rebel computer programmers, kids), but he skillfully dances his paper puppets through exciting action at break-neck speed.  At times it seems as though every page ends in a cliff-hanger, which compells the reader to turn the page and find out what happens next.  Thus it would be appropriate to label this novel with the well-fit cliche of \\"page-turner\\".<br />Prey reads like a summer blockbuster movie - action, action, action, breathe, action, action, action.  During the few breathers, Crichton downshifts into technical lecture mode and the transition can be quite jarring - not the technical details themselves, as he has a way of putting techie stuff into plainspeak - but the change of pace is often quite abrupt just before he launches his characters back into the middle of Pickle #109.  Crichton certainly does his homework, which the 3 page bibliography bears witness to.  I'm not a nanotechnology scientist or popular science junkie so I can't speak to the validity of the theories he projects.  It's technical enough to be believable but written in a way that makes it easy to understand and is certainly eye-opening as to the possibilities (and fears) that the future may hold.<br />It's a given that Prey won't give you deep character angst or reflection, terribly complicated plot lines, or finely textured multi-layered interpersonal communications, but hey, when the readin's this much fun, who cares?  Prey comes highly recommended for those seeking some fun and exciting escapist reading.  Crichton again proves he can spin a great yarn.

0380977788|5.0|\\"Coraline\\" is one of those rare young adult novels which works well for both children and adults. I read it first to myself and then to my kids, and I was surprised to find that they were as delighted by it as I was, even though they were not as disturbed by some of the imagery of the book that got to me. The Dave McKean illustrations throughout the book serve to enhance the story rather than distracting from it, and as with most Gaiman/McKean collaborations, the pictures are almost ideally suited to the printed words, and vice versa.<br />The story is simple, and at its basic level, it's one we've heard before. A young girl, bored and trapped inside on a rainy day, explores her house and finds a hidden passage into an alternate version of her house, in which things seem... different. Wrong, somehow. Though at first the differences are vague, they become more and more clear as the story progresses. When the inhabitants of the alternate house, specifically the twisted other-mother, somehow trap Coraline's parents, she finds that she must face the potential danger to get them back. Her companion for much of the resulting adventure is a cat, which can talk when it's of a mind to do so.<br />Lewis Carroll would be proud... \\"Coraline\\" is a book easily in the tradition of his Alice books, with all of the wonder and magic that he somehow captured, coupled with Gaiman's canny observations, witty dialogue, sprinklings of literary reference, and all-around good writing. There's plenty of story here to keep kids enchanted with the story, and plenty of meat for adults to chew on as well. \\"Coraline\\" is truly a book for children of all ages.<br />Perhaps it is only the perspective of an adult which makes some of \\"Coraline\\" so disturbing. Specific images from the book (long fingernails clicking against black-button eyes, for example) have stuck with me as both especially memorable and intensely chilling. Gaiman has a talent for such things, and I've come to admire him for it.<br />It is also Gaiman's best book to date, and this is coming from an avowed fan of Neil Gaiman. I enjoyed \\"Neverwhere\\" and adored \\"American Gods,\\" but \\"Coraline\\" is a novel of another caliber entirely. In it, Gaiman walks the fine line between children's fantasy and adult terror, and what emerges is a story which is capable of addressing both, while not diluting the wonder or the horror.<br />Truly, a great book to be treasured for everyone in the family.>It is also Gaiman's best book to date, and this is coming from an avowed fan of Neil Gaiman.

B0000931OG|5.0|I downloaded a few songs off this album before it came out, and bought the album the first day it came out and loved it from the start. I have been a Blur fan since I heard Girls &amp; Boys when i was in the third grade, and have since bought all of their albums. I think this album is a step in the right direction for Blur. 13 was a great album, but it took too many listens to really get into, and many longtime fans gave up before then, but I found Think Tank instantly likeable, and it continued to grow on me still. Though Think Thank is reasonabley experimental, I find it quite pop, though it's not the same sound they've had on their earlier albums. Producer Norman Cook discribed the new tracks as sounding like The Clash, and i can see that slightly on tracks like Gene By Gene, which reminds me  of The Clash's Car Jamming. The music here is mostly driven by Damon's voice and the drums and the songs here are some of the best pop songs they've ever done. For me, this was probably the best record they could've made as a follow up to 13. I was worried they'd follow up with something so experimental I'd get it to find that there weren't any songs on it, but Think Tank is actually in my Top 3 Blur albums.

B00009EIQE|5.0|Having been a long-time fan of all of Buddy's work from the 50s to the present and having seen him live a couple dozen times at least including some January Legends shows, I must say that I think this new record is going to be truly legendary. Of course, while he is best known for his electric guitar wizardry, this acoustic sampling is just f'n amazing -- it's haunting and it's all Buddy. It's pretty amazing to hear some of these reviewers call this a sell-out record done for marketing purposes and questioning why he did an acoustic record. Why did he unplug? Because HE CAN. Get a clue, man. He has gained more than enough musical credibility in my book to do whatever the hell he wants to do. To say that he is trying to sound like someone else? That's a real laugh! With this record, he has merely summoned the spirits of all the old time players and you can hear that in the heartbeat of every song. Sure, I'd love to see Buddy do a pure electric record with just him, a bass player and a drummer  what fan wouldn't? This acoustic record is a mf'r, though -- I think we might just be on the verge of seeing a legend receive the true acclaim that he is so long overdue.

It's an apples to oranges comparison, sort of like comparing the Three Stooges to Monty Python. The Three Stooges are funny, but they never could have given us the Dead Parrot Sketch or the Spanish Inquisition, nor should they have.<br />Similarly, Johnny English is not Austin Powers and is not meant to be Austin Powers.<br />Austin Powers is an example of a broader American style of humor directed at the whole English spy genre.<br />Johnny English is an example of English wit with the same subject, but the approach is completely different.<br />English wit is subtle, with the exception of Benny Hill, and Johnny English is a brilliant example of it.<br />The only reason I'm not giving this film 5 stars is a poorly done scene involving a funeral that goes on way too long and violates a couple of the character relationship rules that had been established earlier in the film.<br />Aside from an occasional weak scene, if you loved Black Adder you'll love this film.
B000001FLA|5.0|Yngwie Malmsteen is one of the best guitarists on the planet. I once heard someone say he's one of most \\"over-rated, under-rated\\" guitar players and I suppose that's true, you either like him or you don't. This album has great production and yes it sounds a little dated, but Mark Boals is a great singer and this album has some of Yngwie's most accessible and well written songs. Unlike a lot of Steve Vai, some Joe Satriani, and even some Eric Johnson songs Yngwie's songs rarely wander and have good structure and feel to them. If you want esoteric nonsense listen to Steve Vai, but if you like well written, played, and produced neo-classical metal and all around talent check out Yngwie J. Malmsteen. Nice cover art too by the way. Either this album or Rising Force is an excellent introduction to his music.
B0000041TD|5.0|This is the greatest recording of Boheme, bar none. Pav is simply the King of tenors. And Freni is nearly his match. But if you think Pav sings well here. Wait until you hear him as the Duke in Verdi's Rigoletto! He hits with ease several high Ds. I repeat, high Ds. And his voice, his voice...ah, his voice.<BR>I recommend this Boheme and Pav's Rigoletto with Milnes and Sutherland. Make sure you get his earliest Rigoletto, however. The Pav/Sutherland/Milnes Rigoletto. Pav did several other dukes and they are not nearly as good.
B000000993|5.0|This CD is the best CD to start out with in becoming a Tool fan. No, it's not very deep for a Tool album, but it still has a creative style to it. Many times the bass guitar will stand out more than the lead guitar (Sober, Crawl Away, Bottom), but still, this album gets 5 stars only because it's great compared to any other band besides Tool themselves. This album is more &quot;metal&quot; than Tool's modern &quot;alternative metal&quot; style, and it doesn't have the inspiration that &quot;Aenima&quot; and &quot;Lateralus&quot; bring. Still, this album is worth buying whether you are a fan of Tool or not, and It is still worth listening to even if Tool's later on albums are better.
B000001XN2|5.0|Fans of Corelli and Price must have the video of both Price and Corelli if you love this Travatore as I do.<BR>This video of Price and Corelli, both prime and in flawless voice is a dvd call...Great Stars of Opera - Telecasts from the Bell Telephone Hour 1959-1966. <br />It is as good as this essential Travatore and the sound is far better. And you get to see these two greatest of singers as they sing. It also has Tebaldi, Eileen Farrell, Rise Stevens and a young Joan Sutherland. You have to have the video if you get this cd. The DVD shows the 60's as the golden age of opera. Today's artist just don't compare to this!
B000001ELP|4.0|This album is truly unique for Kiss. There are no songs about womanizing and partying.  It features an orchestra and a choir.  Its also a concept album.  Here it is track by track.<BR>1. Fanfare: A short opening with orchestration that sets the tone. More of an atmospheric piece than a song.<BR>2. Just a Boy: Stanley kicks it off with a slower number where he takes the role of a young boy preparing to save the world. Killer acoustic guitar and a really emotional solo.<BR>3. Odyssey: Another by Paul, I love this song! Strictly an orchestra blended with Eric Carr's powerful drumming. It sounds majestic and Paul sings unusually low register on this one.<BR>4. Only You: Gene's opener. The first song on the album that is dominantly guitar based rock.  Cool vocal effects give it an eerie, story-like feel.<BR>5. Under the Rose: Another by Simmons. This song is really moody.  The stand out on this tune is the use of the choir during the chorus.<BR>6. Dark Light: Ace's only song on The Elder. As you would expect from Frehley, it's pure rock and roll.  Check out the guitar solo on this one! Interesting percussion too.<BR>7. A World Without Heroes: A great Simmons song.  Depressing as all heck with a sullen piano verse and the saddest lyrics in Kisstory.  <BR>8. The Oath: Stanley has the heaviest song on the record.  The Oath crunches along, at Creatures of the Night intensity!  And Paul does a lot of cool falsetto in it as well.<BR>9. Mr. Blackwell: Driven by the bass, Simmons wrote a creepy tune. The riff in the chorus rules and his vocals are very dark.<BR>10: Escape From the Island: This tune is an instrumental that blends with the end of Blackwell.  Upbeat and just a chance for Kiss to free jam.  Full of energy.<BR>11. I: Cool closer where Gene and Paul split vocal duties.  Uplifting and a change of pace for the record.  Imagine Kiss with an Elvis like rockabilly twist.<BR>Give this record a chance.  Yes, it is very different but at least Kiss tried to expand.  This albumhas a special place for me and hopefully it will for you too.
0393317552|4.0|Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20, but in Guns, Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond makes a compelling case for why it was the Europeans who conquered the world and not the Native Americans, Africans or Australians.<br />Diamond, in attempting to explain this fundamental question gives a broad overview of the history of human civilization, starting from our hunter-gatherer beginnings approximately 40,000 years ago.  In this outline, Diamond points out certain natural advantages that Eurasia started out with, which, with the power of compounding statistics, made it a virtual certainty that Eurasians would eventually dominate the globe (baring some outside event like an asteroid collision.)<br />Some of these are advantages one would not necessarily think of, such as the fact that the Eurasian continent has primarily an east-west axis, while in the Americas and Africa, movement of populations has to go north-south.  The east-west axis means that crops domesticated in one area (the fertile crescent or China) can easily be transplanted in other areas since they have similar latitudes and climates.  Therefore, food production technology can spread faster.  Whereas just going 1,000 miles north or south changes the type of crops that can be domesticated and farmed, thus retarding the spread of food production.<br />Diamond also points out that another big advantage of the Eurasians was their accidental benefit of having a large number of big mammals survive the late Pleistocene extinctions.  This allowed the Eurasians to domesticate a wide range of animals.  The Americas were left with one, the llama.  Australia, none.  Africa still contains large mammals, but all are not easily domesticated.  Diamond points out that animal domestication also had an important advantage besides the obvious uses of labor, transport and food.  All of our major epidemic diseases come from our domesticated animals.  For example, influenza epidemics spread outward from China every year, started by people living in close proximity to pigs.  As such, Eurasians developed key immunities from these diseases.  But the Native Americans, Australians and Africans had very little experience with these microbes.  More important to the conquest of the New World by Eurasians than guns or ships, was the presence of smallpox and other diseases that depopulated up to 90% of North America and Mesoamerica (Somewhat less catastrophically but still potent 30% in South America.)<br />Diamond deals with very large macro-trends in history.  Some people have criticized the book as not being able to explain specific historical elements, but Diamond readily acknowledges this.  In Guns, Germs and Steel he is seeking to explain why it was virtually certain Eurasians would displace other peoples and cultures over the long term.<br />As he notes, this type of macro-history could tell you why Eurasians would populate North America and not vice-versa, but it can't give you insight into why Kennedy won the 1960 Presidential election.<br />Diamond has been accused of determinism (I am unsure why this is a dirty word.)  But Guns, Germs and Steel is an important book because it can, I feel, compellingly demonstrate that history is not random.  There are larger trends that lend a certain directionality to history.  That directionality may arise from advantages/disadvantages randomly assigned, but once the machinery is in place, the power of probability takes over.  In short, it was extremely likely, given the basic factors that Diamond lists, that Eurasians would dominate the rest of the planet.  Another outcome, while possible, was extremely unlikely.<br />Of real interest, and one deserving of book length treatment, is why did the Western Europeans, of the various Eurasian peoples (specifically fertile crescent peoples and the Chinese), come to be the ones who dominated the world?  Although only touched on in the epilogue, Diamond posits that the answer for the fertile crescent peoples is obvious, the natural resources of the area were severely strained by the civilizations in the area.  The fertile crescent went from being a net food exporter to and importer and populations fell.  The question of the Chinese is harder, but Diamond's theory is compelling.<br />China, even until 500 years ago was by far the technological superior of Western Europe, but their problem is that they were too unified.  Essentially, Diamond postulates that China's centralization...cultural and technological progress.  A prime example was the Chinese abandonment of oceangoing sailing ships in the 1500's.  Although China's seafaring technology was quite advanced, a change in politics in the Chinese court led to a ban on overseas trade.  Riding on a multi-masted ship could merit the death sentence by 1525.<br />This could never have happened in Western Europe where the political culture was highly fragmented.  If one nation renounced oceangoing ships, others would continue - and reap the rewards for their initiative, thus putting pressure on the original country to change its policies.  When there is fragmentation and competition, selection pressure forces recalcitrant actors to adopt new ways and innovate themselves - or go extinct.<br />Competition breeds strength.<br />All in all Guns, Germs and Steel is a compelling work detailing exactly why things have turned out the way they have in terms of global cultures.  Even if one is not interested in it for its political aspects, it is a fascinating overview of the last 40,000 of human history and will tell you interesting tidbits like how plants came to be domesticated., the natural resources of the area were severely strained by the civilizations in the area.

B000089RVX|3.0|Much like everyone else, I was snagged by the singers voice, entranced I bought the cd. With high hopes I popped it in the cd player, and sat back to enjoy. Within the first 5 tracks I was so annoyed by her playing with her voice and not knowing what sits best with it. Overall, not a bad cd, but improvements are needed.
0156027321|2.0|I really had to force myself to finish this book for my book club. There were glimmers of brilliance, but overall I do not feel that those were plentiful enough to make up for the rest of the book. It was sometimes gory, sometimes boring...not a good read.<br />I would not recommend this book - and I don't say that about too many books! Try something else. I think you will be happier.
B00005V9HA|5.0|This is highly worth your money if you are into horror. Of course if you are into horror, the chances are that you have already seen this movie and are thus part of the freaky yet lovable cult of Re-Animator.<BR>If you have not seen this, then just know that it is wonderfully campy, quite gory, and has a beautiful women. What more could you want out of a horror film. Special features you say....this has about 6 hours worth of extras and the dvd transfer is great!<BR>Horror fans and gorehounds owe most of their present day enjoyment and amusement to Anchor Bay.<BR>So it is with great love in my heart and a tear in my eye, that I raise my bloodstained glass of gore to Anchor Bay, here's to you and to many many more campy and fun moments sniff! haha

B000002H4C|5.0|This is a superb compilation full of realitively overlooked 80's gems (with the exception of Journey's &quot;Open Arms&quot;). If it weren't for this popular movie, these songs and maybe even their artists wouldv'e been forgotten. I am 18 and have missed the theatrical boat for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; but home video took care of that. One of this first things I did after seeing the movie was going out and buying this excellent CD. It was an unforgettbale time when music was unique in their lyrics and sound. If there were ever to be a justice anthology for the 80's, this CD is a perfect start. Imagine, this was only by 1981. The decade just begun and already, the 80's music treasure trove was wrought with riches. Go out and buy this. You won't be disappointed as a film fan or a classic rock fan!
6302814359|5.0|This film renders all other zombie films pale by comparison.<BR>Put simply, it is the singularily most hilarious spectacle which I have ever witnessed. It's also steeped in 80's nostalgia which adds to the appeal for me, and the humour. I laughed so much that I hurt my lungs and nearly threw up. This is a true comedy - horror classic, and I don't feel that can be said about many efforts these days and certainly not about the ... ROTLD parts 1 and 3 and that ... Romero trilogy of cinematic .... If this ever gets released on DVD, it will be a great cultural event. <BR>  So what's it about? Well, for those unlucky enough to have never seen it, the plot goes as follows. Two young lads find a barrel of dumped toxic waste which fell off the back of a military truck. When the barrell opens, a zombie emerges and scares the children to the extent that they flee the scene. <BR>The toxic gunge enters the water supply and contaminates the graveyard, reawakening the dead. Many adventures follow.<BR>There is a great soundtrack used in this film at always the right times and thankfully the violence is kept to an acceptable level. If however, you are a gore obsessed [person], this may not interest you. I really hope that it will be released on DVD in the future since I will mortgage my existence to obtain a copy.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I had great hopes for this movie.  As a native New Yorker of Irish descent I was looking forward to seeing a movie where the abysmal early experience of the Famine immigrants would be acknowledged and honored and I might be able to catch a glimpse of my home town in the middle of the 19th century.  I also knew that Martin Scorsese, another native New Yorker and a great director, had been intent on making this picture for 20 years.  It had to be great, right?  Wrong!<br />Instead of the movie I expected, I got a depressing story of revenge against a background that is at all times too busy, too confusing and too unreal.  I know a great deal of praise has been given to the sets, but I can't see them as anything more than plywood.  Maybe that's because I know those streets and the buildings that remain (many of them are still there, just a block away from the courthouses were one does one's jury duty).  In fact, farther uptown I live in a slightly renovated tenement that was built within a decade of this movie's period.<br />And the film lacks balance.  Its focus is on the lowest life of the poorest people (with occasional glimpses of the life of the richest), with the thieves, pickpockets and prostitutes and ignores the many more numerous people who were struggling to make an honest living against fearful odds.  Indeed, in its single, and simple minded, focus on the low life and the story of mindless revenge, it misses the really big story of the time.  This was the story of how the poor of New York came to resent the Civil War and the events of the draft riots.  Yes, there are a few short vignettes of the riots toward the end of the movie, but most of them are so fleeting that they are no more than glimpses.  And, without the voiceover narration for those scenes, they would be incomprehensible, since they are totally unrelated to the main story.<br />There is not a single sympathetic character in the film, with the possible exception of \\"Monk\\" McGinn (Brendon Gleeson). This character and that of the truly repulsive \\"Bill the Butcher\\" (Daniel Day-Lewis) are at least three-dimensional and alive.  The rest of the characters are one-dimensional, like the sets.  This must be due to the talent of Mssrs. Gleeson and Day-Lewis,  since the script doesn't help much.  Mr. Day-Lewis is, as most commentators have acknowledged, the best thing about this movie.  He completely dominates it.  But part of that dominance has to be the fact that there is no one to challenge him for it.  What a pity!<br />The DVD itself is good quality and has lots of extra features.  The best of these are the two historical background programs.  And the glossary of terms was very helpful, since the movie is full of this otherwise incomprehensible slang.

6305508550|5.0|This is an absolutely genius movie. If you have not seen it, you're missing out. I don't know what to say, but you will watch it over and over again, and it will not fail to have you rolling on the floor laughing, literally. So simple, yet so hilarious! It's my favorite movie, period. Perfect concept, perfect acting. Perfect.
B00003CXAY|2.0|This had all the promise and excitement that a recommended experimental type film can deliver. One problem. It didnt deliver. I couldnt even watch all of it. Too wierd? No. Too controversial? No. Too experimental? No. Too damn BORING!!!! Yes.
B00009MGGI|4.0|The three TV movies are full of great performances (from a great cast) and sinister intrigue.  Sex, deception, murder, and all sorts of villainy littered throughout the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and even Number 10.  Why not?  The movies wouldn't be any fun if these films dealt out sins in small portions.  As over the top as it is, it works and it's great to watch!    \\"House of Cards\\" started as a single book, which became a very different miniseries.  The intro with Francis Urquhart looking at a photo of Thatcher was apparently broadcast around the time she was voted out of office... a strange and eerie coincidence.  I consider the TV version better than the book, however I did see it before I read it.  Urquhart's sinister and devious charm help make the viewer admire him (in a strange way)... yet he's ruthless and cunning, and you love to hate him.  Wait for the end... it yanked me up from my seat.    It's a who-dun-it where you know who did it all along.  The main character, Francis Urquhart, takes the audience into his confidence... you sometimes feel a little guilty knowing what's going on.  If you get confused while watching Urquhart talk with various characters, just wait until they are off screen... F.U. will probably fill you in on what he *really* thinks.  Take notes on who dies, how they die, and who does it... a grim game to play while watching the three miniseries.    \\"To Play the King\\" might be more of the same from the previous book and TV movie (both are worth reading and viewing)... but, you can't really get enough of Urquhart.  Plus, you get a slightly stronger impression that Elizabeth Urquhart has more to do with the life and politics of her husband.  She's often referred to as the Lady MacBeth of this series (and not without reason).  No more are the street shots of rats and sewers found in this series (a great theme in \\"House of Cards\\"), but now we see even more private lives and intrigue than before.      This is a battle of wills:our boy F.U. against the newly crowned idealistic King of England.  The King cares, he feels the pain of the country, he even seems to be sincerely motivated... but he's acting against the rules of conduct.  You know who will come out on top, but to watch to see the other characters work in and out of their side of the war between Urquhart and the King.  The royals, the advisors, the press, and public relations crew... they've all got a stake, and they're all pretty dirty.    \\"The Final Cut\\" seems to have a lot crammed into it.  The book is better... and again it's a bit different than the TV movie.  That is not to say that the TV movie isn't worth viewing.  Fans of Indiana Jones might recognize Tom Makepiece... the actor who portrays him (Paul Freeman) also played Belloc in \\"Raiders\\"... he also played Prof. Moriarty in \\"Without a Clue\\".    Urquhart is getting old.  His time is coming, but what about life after Number 10 for Francis and Elizabeth?  For that matter, what about life after Number 10 at Number 10?  Who can replace Urquhart?  Francis might have enough cunning and will to beat the record of Margaret Thatcher's rule, but his past might catch up with him.    Is it hard for Americans to follow British politics?  Not really... it is very enjoyable, dark, and even funny.      Some viewers might think this is a wicked commentary on conservative politics... you might think that.  I'm sure plenty of folks would even say that.  The author of the books (Michael Dobbs) worked for Thatcher.  Maybe he's throwing stones at the Tories, or even any conservative politician.  Yet, neither side of the political isle is safe.  He's just spinning a great political yarn.    Not everyone in politics has the makings of F.U., but it's fun to think so.    Sir Ian Richardson's performance is truly fantastic... he's a genius.  Susannah Harker is no slouch either.  Diane Fletcher may not be seen or heard that often, but her character is as good as omnipresent.      Look up the cast on IMDB... they are so many good performances I can't name them all.  You've probably seen them on various British TV series and films.  After all, there's a running joke among my friends that says there's only about 35 actors working for the BBC, so they all end up in the same shows. ;)

B000000WA4|5.0|As any music lover knows double albums usually have enough quality material to make a better single album.Since CD playing time can allot for 75+ minutes,double CDs can border on overkill.MCATIS is one exception(as well as Nine Inch Nails' The Fragile and 2Pac's All Eyez On Me),becaues every song stands up on it's own terms.Billy Corgan ability to balance hard rock and soft musing is amazing.From the Wagnerian string sweeps of Tonight,Tonight to the blistering Tales of Scorched Earth,as well as the hard rockers, (Zero and Bullet With Butterfly Wings)pop stylings(1979,Lily,By Starlight)this album never slips for one minute.Whats more amazing is the albums ability to go from wistful(Cupid de Locke,33)to even goofy(We Only Come Out At Night).The album closes with the beatiful,open ended Farwell,Goodnight which after listening to the final notes,you want to give it up for Billy Corgan.Later albums may have strictly focused on the hard rock(Machina/Machines of God) and the soft lilting(Adore),but this is where both co-exist in one beautiful whole.
2070364232|5.0|Rene Goscinny is a wonderfully talented author who has blessed the world with a timeless classic in Le Petit Nicolas. Jean Jacque Sempe's fabulous illustrations add a hilarious twist to an already entertaining book. The funniest chapter is one called \\"Je suis malade.\\" In this chapter, Nicolas gets sick from eating too much candy. He must stay home from school the next day to recover but he sure can cause a lot of trouble from his bed! This book reminds me of Beverly Cleary's Ramona and it also reminds me of the little prince. I read this book to my brothers every night before they go to bed. The grammar and vocabulary are simple and easy to read. I highly reccommend this book for anyone and everyone who like French and to anyone who simply enjoys a great book!
B000002MG1|5.0|If Green is like pine,& Out Of Time is like Maple,than AFTP is like ageless oak.Like Murmur, it exists outside of time,where it struck a chord when first heard ,and continue to amaze ,as well as sound better with every listen.    Even the lone throwaway(New Orleans Instr. 1)sounds as bittersweet as the rest.Drive remains at the same time one of the greatest yet underrated REM all-time classic,while The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight & Man On The Moon are bouncy & jovial yet as sad & mournful(the former courtesy of John Paul Jones string arrangement).Special mentions must go to Everybody Hurts,Find The River,Try Not To Breathe & the otherworldly Nightswimming which transcends this album to unimaginable heights.    Though REM's music lately has it's ups(MONSTER)& downs(New Adventures in Hi-Fi, Up, Around the Sun),AFTP is the one album that will undoubtedly set the standard for REM's music let alone pop music itself.
B000002N9L|4.0|THE ARTIST's 2nd album (with that symbol) is kinda hot. Reminds me of 'DIRTY MIND' Lil' rock-a-billy,lil' funk. Unexpecteds like &quot;Dinner With Delores&quot;,&quot;Had U&quot; and &quot;The Same December&quot; sounds like new vibes by THE ARTIST or PRINCE or whatever (whomever) his is (what happened to JAMIE STARR?) 11 songs under 40 minutes is an EP today. With his last official LP (EP) for Warners,THE ARTIST's 'CHAOS AND DISORDER' was supposed to be a dud,taboo,booty for Warners. THE ARTIST didn't try hard enough for those standards.

Songs like the TEVIN CAMPBELL better version of &quot;Shhh&quot; and the great comeback on a different label of &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl In The World&quot; and the ballad no one predicted &quot;I Hate U&quot;,I thought THE ARTIST was going to do another '1999' light years before 1999. NOT! Songs like &quot;Dolphin&quot;,&quot;P Control&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot; musicially sounds like the 'PURPLE RAIN' soundtrack. THE ARTIST ain't looking for originally like PRINCE would.

B000002KGT|5.0|Coming after their successful 1975 eponymous album,Fleetwood Mac drops a bomb on the music world,and its title is Rumours.The album is more tighter,the songwriting top notched,but the overall atmosphere is dense and filled with tension.Contributing to this factor are various romantic breakups in the group as well as substance excess.The result is a polished piece of great pop music,shaded with dark undertones.Besides the classic hits(Go Your Own Way,Dreams,Don't Stop,You Make Loving Fun),we also get the masterfully played Lindsey Buckingham track Never Going Back Again,as well as Stevie Nicks rocking Gold Dust Woman.The albums centerpiece The Chain sums up the state of the group,especially when they sacrifice their personal feeling to keep the group together.Fortunately,the classic line-up did keep it going for another ten years before Buckingham quit,only to reunite for President Clinton's inaugurational ball(as well as 1997's The Dance,and 2003's Say You Will&lt;sans Christine McVie&gt;.In all Rumours is the classic lineup's masterwork which has yet to be matched.
B00006SFBD|1.0|This has to be a joke! When ever my office gets bored we crank this cd up and laugh ourselves into hysterics. Damnation is an awsome album but then when I picked this up I couldnt stop laughing. Great stuff for the kids!
B000002KD5|5.0|Listening to this album give you the impression that something special had evolved within Fleetwood Mac.It may not be as revered as it's more familiar follow up Rumours, it does holds its own very well.Newcomers Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks give the group a much needed shot of inspiration.Buckingham not only contributes his signature fingerpicking ,but also fine songs in Monday Morning,and World Turning(which is better heard live).<BR>  Stevie Nicks is the real star here .Although her vocal contributions is miniscule,her two songs(Rhiannon and the beautiful Landslide)linger well after the album ends.Christine McVie's contributions(Warm Ways,Say You Love Me as well as the suductive Over My Head)shows her at the top of her game.<BR>  Although Rumours was around the corner,Fleetwood Mac shows the group at its brightest before the darkness prevades.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Johnny Depp is amazing in this film, as per usual. There's never a dull moment, an ultimately fascinating movie. <br />I simply don't know what else to say about it. Blew me away.
B0000027RL|5.0|Later albums may have been tighter and more complexed(as well as a bit pretensious),but Ten is the raw,relentless Pearl Jam we've fell in love with a decade ago.Along with Nirvana's Nevermind,Ten encapsulated the 90's musical revolution,where hairbands became extinct and music became something more grass rootd and less mass marketing product.Even Flow,Alive and Jeremy are etched in our neural pathways,but Once,Oceans as well as Black transcends this album to classic status.Release is the ultimate album closer as it shine a light through the darkness.Even if you've hated what Pearl Jam's been releasing lately,start back  at Ten ,if only to remind yourself why you fell in love with the band in the first place.
0792164903|3.0|It is a slightly slow moving film and I didn't find it overly interesting. <br />However, I loved Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane. He captured the man perfectly, and for that I'd say see the movie.<br />I did like this movie. It's not my favorite, and I probably wouldn't see it again. But it was good enough not to bore me, thanks to mister Depp.
B000002MU3|4.0|REM turns the amps to 11,chuck the mandolins,and sing about sex,fame,& power(\\"Ziggy Stipedust\\"?).Monster may be the REM CD that fills most used CD sections,but it's a brave piece of work that continue to amaze,yet puzzle some.Those who jumped on the Losing My Religion-bandwagon,will jump right off(I must admit I'm one of those,but it made me check out their earlier albums,and I've been a devoted fan ever since).What's The Frequency,Kenneth kicks it into high gear,while Crush With Eyeliner take the Aladdin Sane-esque route.Bang & Blame,King of Comedy,Let Me In and You makes this album a worthwhile collection.Although with all the overdrive in the guitars,the rhythm section sounds kind of flabby in the middle,especially compared to Pearl Jam & Nirvana.But you know its REM ,always doing it their way.
0394716787|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite books, and one of the oldest in my collection, as I have had a copy of this since High School. I had always thought that Poe's stories and poems were interesting, however it wasn't until college (where I was an English minor) that I truly began to appreciate Poe's 'Victori-Goth' style (as one of my Eng. prof's called it). The dreariness, darkness and utter horror of such classic tales as \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" \\"A Descent Into The Maelstrom,\\" \\"The Masque Of The Red Death,\\" \\"The Raven,\\" \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher\\" etc. etc. are such radical departures of what was being published in American Lit at the time. There are so many wonderful, and truly classic tales in this collection that it would take forever to list them all.  These stories are genre crossing and can be read and enjoyed by anyone. If you are into the whole \\"goth\\" scene - this book is (definitely) for you, if you are a fan of horror authors - this books for you and if you are a fan of the early American storytellers, like Irving, well, you guessed it - this books for you! A great read, although some stories are very detailed and require a second reading. I would recommend this highly entertaining collection to everyone who can read. You won't find a better collection of poetry, horror and early American stories anywhere else. At the price listed above, it's a steal!!
B000002L9Y|4.0|If many compare Tusk to The Beatles white album,than TITN is their Abbey Road.Although nobody forsaw Lindsey Buckingham's departure at the time,this album sounds like the classic line-ups swan song(which it was ,since Christine McVie's departure recently).Unfortunately Stevie Nicks only contributes three song(due to a certain problem which led to a stint at rehab)Seven Wonders is her best song since Dreams and Sara.Buckingham as usual dominates the album.But this time his contributions(Big Love,Family Man,the title song)sounds as complexed as the albums production sounds polished.Christine McVie's Everywhere and Little Lies display a duribility as they are endlessly played on radio.Although there is a fair share of weak material(Caroline,the generic Isn't It Midnight)the  production values  make this their best sounding album ever,although not the best.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a wallflower is the best book i have ever read.  I'm 13 and ive just finished this book its very real and he talks about actual things its almost like it happened to him its just undescribable how insanely good this book is i cant say enough to put out how perfect this book really is recommened by one of my friends, probably the best author of all time in my perspective anyway.. (my friend is) recommened this and now hes over powered her... kinda haha they level up but its just.. im just rambling now arent i... well its the best book you should really read it i swear you'll never be able to put it down.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Not since Steely Dan and Boston has a group used the studio as an additional instrument along with guitar,bass & drums.The attention to detail is amazing and even the songs tempo shift and key changes make this required listening for three chord Charlies everywhere.Each song stand on their own merit from the build up opener Cherub Rock to the sweet open-ended closer Luna(which they improve upon on MCATIS'sGoodnight).Disarm uses cellos and acoustic power chords to unbelievable effect while Quiet's unexpected time signature change feels instinctual.Silver**** the one chord 8 minute jamfest is the epitomy of grunge improv while Mayonase was composed due to a junky guitars tendency to emit a wailing sound.Soma goes from dreamy to screamy and back.Like other visionaries of music Billy's not the greatest singer,but like Dylan before him,it's about what he's conveying than how he sings it.One of the greatest albums of the 90's Siamese Dreams has yet to be preceded.
0780622553|5.0|Dark City completely blew me away. As the credits started to roll and the lights came up in the house, I could hardly move as I noticed how heavily I was breathing. This film was like an orgasm for the senses. The cinematography, mood, music and ambience easily equaled that of &quot;The Crow&quot; and &quot;City of Lost Children&quot;. Unfortunately, this film lacked in just about every other category. That is to say, the acting, plot, dialog, and characters were all pretty laughable. Still, I have to give this movie 5 stars, just for the intense feeling of &quot;WOW!&quot; I had when it was over.
B000002LOE|5.0|Out Of Time is the double edge sword for REM.It brought them to superstar status yet it brought the wrath of longtime fans who thought they'd sold out.In retrospect it seems a little extreme since at the time,there was nothing like it.In the time that hairbands were soon to become an endangered species,and Nevermind was just around the corner,REM released an album that took chances when most acts at the time(heck even today)ran a formula into the ground. Losing My Religion led the way with its delicatly picked mandolin and understated string arrangement.But for those who played only the aformentioned track 2(and sometimes track 7&lt;Shiny Happy People&gt;)were missing out on a great album.Near Wild Heaven,Shiny Happy People,and Radio Song are bouncy pop songs that improve on the peppy tracks on Green.But songs like Low,Half a World Away &amp; Texarkana have an air of melencholy about them.Country Feedback build in intensity as Michael Stipe sing the most personal pre-AFTP song,and Honey In Me brings together both sad &amp; happy together on the final track.Old fans could yell sell out all the want,but OOT came out at the right time which also helped pave the way for more daring music to be embraced by the mainstream and make the 90's a memorable decade in music
B00000JGHS|4.0|So a friend and I snagged this movie for a guy's night when the girls were out of town. We got it more as a joke than anything else. I was quite surprised by how much I liked it. Not because it was sexy but because it was funny. The main thing this flick has going for it is that it didn't take itself seriously. Ving Rhames, who I always love, did a superb job playing a no BS bodyguard. Burt Reynolds was hilarious. And Demi? Well, she got naked. That's about all I can say for her. The story was hugely predictable, and the acting was pretty bad, but this movie was really funny. There were some great one-liners. The best line of the movie was one of Ving's: \\"Nico: What are you, nuts?! Shad: Yeah, psycho. Delusions of invincibility combined with a strong homicidal urge. I have a kick-your-ass fetish.\\" Rent it with the guys, drink a few beers, have a few laughs. It's not as bad as you might think.
0380018179|5.0|I just finished this book for the first time and I plan to read it many more times. The passion that this woman writes with inspires me. The characters are so vivid in my mind that I feel like I'm in the story. If someone can do that to you then that is a sure sign of a great book. Read it, I assure you you'll love it.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|How many times did I hear this album as a teenager, cruising around town, probably up to no good like any good teen should be?  Too many to count.  Simply put, this is one of the greatest rock CD's ever, and its short length just makes it all the more powerful.  Of course many staples of classic rock are here, but it's songs like \\"Atomic Punk\\" and \\"On Fire\\" that make this the greatest guitar album, along with \\"Are You Experienced,\\" ever released.  Eddie Van Halen deserves induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame based on this album alone, as it has inspired countless numbers of wannabe guitarists.  Van Halen never was much for social commentary, but these partying anthems still sound great blasting out of my car speakers.  Most of the time now, I'm not looking to get in trouble when I'm driving around with this CD, but I can pretend can't I?
B000000WFF|2.0|And that's not saying much. These girls are annoying and dead(not literally.) This is nothing but pure bubblegum pop, though not as cheesy as the first record. The only good songs on here are Never GIve Up on the Good Times(should have been a single instead of the awful other three) and Viva Forever. My recommendation? Buy the Viva Forever single-t's their only good song, and the rest of this piece...(except for Never Give Up, download that one) isn't worth it.
B000003N7K|5.0|Johnny Hartman has to be the most criminally overlooked singer who ever drew breath.  When Johnny wraps his pipes around the first song on this album, \\"They Say It's Wonderful,\\" you know you can now die happy because you have been to the mountaintop!  Kudos to Clint Eastwood for featuring Johnny's songs in \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" and giving some long overdue exposure to this man.  \\"The Johnny Hartman Collection\\" is a great 2 CD set for those looking to get a great intro to this singer, but if you can't afford the 2 disc, this recording with Trane is the place to start.  Johnny's singing only gets better when accompanied by the mighty Trane.  Pretty much every song they tackle here turns out to be the definitive reading (after you hear \\"Lush Life,\\" you will NEVER be able to hear it any other way!!  This is that perfect album (played on repeat) for those evenings spent romancing, dancing, cooking, or just breathing.  Sure, it's a bit short, but some of the best things in life don't last that long.
B000003TA4|5.0|If you are into Nirvana i dont know why you wouldnt buy this cd.  Not one single song on this cd is bad, they are all excellent.
B00005B36H|5.0|I think that this album is the best one that Tool has put out yet! From the very beginning this CD grabs you and doesn't let go until the very end. It is amazing how Maynard's voice can sound so soothing at times, and other times sound so intense. The bass riffs that Justin goes into still have me blown away after almost 2 years of listening to it. Adam is by far one of the most talented guitarist today. And the fact that he directed almost all of their videos is very impressive to me. Finally, the drumming on this album is AMAZING! Every drum beat that Danny does sounds absolutely amazing, I have never heard drumming quite as good as his. All in all, I think that this CD is a must have for anyone that likes music!
B000002LHX|5.0|What can I say, other than that this album is absolutely fantastic! It is the perfect soundtrack, and compliments the movie very well. I don't think any Prince album has spawned so many classics from a single album. You just can't help but be hooked when you hear songs like &quot;Batdance&quot; and &quot;Vicki Waiting&quot;. A must-have for the Prince fan, or anyone for that matter. Buy it!
0385504209|2.0|I had high hopes when I started this book. Being a scientist I was intrigued by the symbology, numbers, codes, etc. But I have to say I was sadly disappointed as the book progressed. Not only are the heroines in this book exceptionally BRILLIANT (they can solve complex puzzles in a matter of seconds which many could not solve over millenniums), they are incredibly lucky ... always getting out of impossible situations perfectly. The book was shallow, predictable and too neat. Everything fell into place within a of matter pages - where is the suspense in that? Give me some depth.<br />One positive ... a good book for a coast to coast plane ride or a beach vacation.
0316666343|5.0|This book is hands down the best book I have ever read.  It evoked a whole array of emotions that I never thought possible and in the end left me with the warm comfort that our loved ones live on with us after death.  Anyone who does not read this is doing a dis-service to their soul.   I loved this book.
B00006L83N|5.0|BY FAR THE YEARS BEST, and certainly their most commercial and<BR>tight album to date. All elements on this album are perfect.<BR>be ready for sheer blazing prog-rock. MUST OWN!
B00008K7AM|4.0|Rob Schneider is \\"The Hot Chick\\", that is after a freak accident with some voodoo cursed earrings causes his mind to be subplanted into the body of a very attractive high school senior while her mind takes a vacation in his own body.  The problem I have with this movie is not with its improbability.  In the aftermath of \\"There's Something About Mary\\" it seems that every comedy has forgone the genuine laugh for the hearty gross out and while, I must admit, I found myself doing the cringe/chuckle during many of this movie's totally ridiculous vignettes I can't say that the cumulative result of those two hours spent in the dark was worthwhile.  Yes, Schneider is at his usual, self-depricating best.  Yes, there are some moments that will make you laugh.  But the plot, such as it is, does not hold together in anything but the most superficial way, leaving the viewer completely unfulfilled by the final fade out.<BR>TRANSFER WISE: A nice looking DVD with sharply contrasted, clear images.  Black levels and colors are well balanced.  Minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization are present but they are extremely rare, for a very smooth looking visual presentation.  The audio is 5.1 and nicely spread over the surrounds, especially in the music tracks.<BR>EXTRAS: A making-of featurette, music video, audio commentary and deleted scenes.  Nicely put together.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: If you're not big on plot and think that you might like to see a grown man squeezed into a prom dress then \\"The Hot Chick\\" is for you.  Personally, I hunger for more intelligent fair - comedy is supposed to excite the mind, not turn the stomach!
1400034779|5.0|Love, hate, suspense, mystery, humor....It has it all.  Well written leaves you wanting more.  Can't wait to read other books by this author.  You will not want to put it down until you finish it.  The characters are realistic with all the flaws of humanity and all the goodness too.

B000002RXS|1.0|I much prefer the Rise Steven Carman. Callas is a soprano trying to push her mooning voice and poor frence into a role unsuitable for her. She should leave the mezzo role for far superior divas like Stevens and Horne. <BR>Again, tell me, what's the fuss???
B000069HKH|5.0|An excellent record. Bruce is like great wines: at more older,<BR>more good. Bruce is composing according with his age, and with<BR>this violent and intolerant times. Bruce should have been awarded with Album of the Year's grammy. I hope It doesnt take him such a <BR>long time for giving us other record.
B000002IG4|5.0|On his second solo album, 1982's \\"Hello, I Must Be Going,\\" Phil Collins shows two sides to himself: the happier man with a new ladylove in his life (the woman named Jill in the album credits), and the bitter man saying his last goodbyes to his first ex-wife. The end result is a powerful album, mixing tough rock with delectible pop, with a generous dose of horn-driven jazz/pop as well. It's one of Phil's best discs. The big hit from the album is Phil's faithful cover of the Supremes' \\"You Can't Hurry Love,\\" and while Phil does great justice to the song, it's his own compositions that really stand out here. The angry \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" & \\"Do You Know, Do You Care\\" are brilliant, powerful songs, with Phil's harsh lyrics, vocal & drumming attacks on both making these songs among his greatest recorded moments. \\"Like China\\" is a very humorous song (with Phil sporting a Cockney accent) about a young bloke who wants to make it with his girlfriend, but she keeps turning him down. The album's secret weapon, however, is the atmospheric \\"Thru These Walls,\\" an outstanding song about a lonely man in desperate need of physical contact, but has to make do with hearing his next-door neighbors making love. It's one of Phil's strongest pieces. \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\" & \\"It Don't Matter To Me\\" are both fine, upbeat jazz poppers, and \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\\" is an excellent mid-tempo ballad. Phil includes a great jazz rave-up with the instrumental \\"The West Side,\\" and closes the album with the beautiful love song, \\"Why Can't It Wait 'Til Morning.\\" Every song here is first-rate, as is Phil's work & production. \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\" is a terrific second effort from Phil Collins.
0385504209|5.0|If you like this book read &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail,&quot; by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh. I say DOWN with christianity! Wake up people, a new age is upon us! No more killing in the name of a false god.
0375751513|5.0|The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\"  I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed.  Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale.  The prose is absolutely lyrical.<br />Beauty is a dominant theme.  Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis.  The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality.  Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him.  But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait.  Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.<br />A secondary theme is the absence of reality.  In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian.  He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything.  Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people.  Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality.  Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality.  Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life.  It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life.  Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\"  If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.<br />Lastly is the theme of homosexuality.  Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.<br />All in all, this book is excellent.  Read this book, you will be glad you did!with equal magnitude of the written text.  <br />All in all, this book is excellent.  Read this book, you will be glad you did!
0790735431|5.0|I have to be different from most of the other reviewers and give this movie a full 5 stars. It is one of my favorites. As a former hookup man, crew chief, flight engineer, and door gunner, I have seen exactly the type of character assortment and wacky actions that this film portrays. There is always one that is afraid of dying. There is always AT LEAST one hung over person, usually with a barf bag within reach. There is always the one that tries to ride herd on the rest and keep them paying attention to their job. There is always one glory hound that feels he must get a shot at everybody's job so he has bragging rights when he gets home. So this set of characters is totally credible and all were played with extraordinary skill. I love them all, even the jerk.<br />As for historical accuracy, it is not accurate. They based the story on the Memphis Belle, but incorporated all the incidents and accidents that happened to the flying fortresses. If it didn't happen to the Belle, her crew witnessed it. In my opinion, the movie is made better for this. It also serves to educate people about the realities of WWII bomber flights. I'm all for that. The public needs to be made aware that these men went through a hell that most cannot begin to imagine. Thus, this movie performs a vital function.<br />As for the entertainment value ... it is top of the line. You will feel the pain and dodge the shrapnel! The anti-aircraft rounds make me get in fast motion! I especially like the part about the monkey harness and can identify fully with it. The pilot always had to force me to put mine on, and like the guy in this movie, it saved my bacon once. There's just no comparison to flapping in the breeze beneath an aircraft while other crewmembers try to haul you back aboard. (But you'll never have to be told to put on your monkey harness again!) Thus, I identify and empathize with his position ... literally! <br />Order a copy today and see if it doesn't fully engage all your systems!

B000002VCT|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's third album, 1978's &quot;Pyramid,&quot; is a heavenly delight. With a theme of mysticism, and once again spearheaded by Alan Parsons &amp; his partner Eric Woolfson, this album is progressive pop/rock at it's very best. Dreamy, melodic songs are littered all over this one: the classic prog-pop instrumentals &quot;Voyager,&quot; &quot;In The Lap Of The Gods,&quot; &amp; &quot;Hyper-Gamma Spaces,&quot; the powerful &quot;What Goes Up,&quot; the beautiful &quot;The Eagle Will Rise Again,&quot; the great rockers &quot;One More River&quot; and the stunning &quot;Can't Take It With You,&quot; the deliciously quirky &quot;Pyramania,&quot; and the gorgeous finale, &quot;Shadow Of A Lonely Man.&quot; Outstanding songwriting, production &amp; performances, great orchestrations by Andrew Powell (can't have a Project album without him!), and great vocals throughout by the likes of Colin Blunstone, David Paton, Lenny Zakatek, John Miles, and others. With &quot;Pyramid,&quot; the Alan Parsons Project deliver another terrific disc.
B000060P79|3.0|I bought this CD as a gift and ended up listening to it. I really really enjoyed their sound. When it comes to catchy melodies and upbeat rock, Simple Plan has it down.<br />However, I was turned off by some of the lyrics. Here you have grown men whose subject material ranges from fighting with parents (One Day), to complaining that 'summer plans are gone forever' because of a job (Worst Day Ever), to wrecking your dad's car (God Must Hate Me) to 'dropping out of school' (I'd Do Anything) to having no friends (I'm Just a Kid). The fact that many of their lyrics are aimed at junior high students when the members of the band are clearly beyond high school, gives a feeling of insincerity. At times, the disc is well suited to be a soundtrack to a high school comedy show like Saved By the Bell. I understand that they are simply trying to appeal to their audience and give kids music they can relate to, but in the process they leave some more mature, post-puberty fans out to dry.<br />When not focused on teen and pre-teen angst, Simple plan has a sound that really works for them. Their single, 'Addicted' is a fine example. It's catchy and people of all ages can relate. Other favorites of mine include 'You don't Mean Anything' because of its irresistible hook, 'Meet You There' because I can realte to it so much I sounds like I could have wrote it, and 'Perfect', again, because of the fact that I can relate.<br />If Simple Plan can mature lyrically, I think they'd really be on to something. Who knows, maybe someday we'll get to see A Simple Plan: The College Years.
0393057658|5.0|Since this book has came out- some have questioned the accurracy of events and quotes in the book. I don't care about that. I also do not think Lewis is the greatest writer in the world.<BR>I still gave this book FIVE STARS just for the information that I learned about Beane and how he goes about his business.  <br />I am probably more knowledgeable than most Baseball fans, if for no other reason, because I have followed the game so closely for several decades.  That said- I have had several paradigm shifts in how I look at the baseball business.  I won't get specific because I do not want to ruin anything. <br />If you are a baseball fan- this is a MUST read just for what you will learn about baseball. It is a fascinating book, regardless of whether some or all events/quotes are true or false.  The window into Beane's organization is so interesting.  You will never look at the baseball business, or baseball for that matter, the same way again.<br />Simply put- the most important baseball book of this generation.<br />There are Beane sidekicks and clones such as the GM in Toronto (JP Ricciardi) and in Boston (Theo Epstein) using the same valuation methods and strategies.  There will be more of these types running teams each year.  The future of baseball will get alot more interesting if this trend keeps up. Who knows, maybe these guys will be the ones to bring financial sanity back to the game.
B0000542D2|5.0|I had the definite fortune of seeing this film for the first time as a midnight show in an actual theater many years ago. I'd been a Beatlemaniac for several years, and it is hard to describe the feeling of actually seeing and hearing live, moving Beatles after seeing b&w stills of the movie for years in magazines, etc.<BR>This film remains staunchly in my top 10 movies of all time, bar none. Whether a Beatle fan or not,the undeniably-infectious fun of the movie, coupled with the unbelievably charismatic Beatles themselves, make this film a rare example of a truly upbeat \\"feel good\\" film.<BR>I won't comment much on the DVD package itself as I've only actually watched the film at this early point. I'm not a psycho DVD-phile, I won't gank about the screen ratios or whatever, the sound seemed merely adequate considering the capabilites of previous DVD's I own, and actually seemed to turn hollow and echo-ey toward the end, and I'm not sure if it was an attempt to make the film sound 'Live' at that point or what.<BR>What is important to remember however is what a great film this is from every standard of measure, giving one an all-too-brief glimpse as to why the world initially went bonkers over these cheeky jokers. Although a work of fiction, Alun Owen has done a fantastic job of delineanating the fabs different personalities in such a way that allows the viewer an abbreviated glimpse into a highly sanitized version of who/what the lads were at this period in their history.<br />A Hard Day's Night is a masterpiece pure and simple, and should serve as a milestone for all future generations. These guys were all that AND a bag of chips. If I've seen the film once I've seen it a dozen times, and I never get tired of a single frame.<BR>So stop reading the Queen (that's an in-joke) and get your copy now!

B00005JLRT|3.0|I had expected more from the crew of the New Generation. I thought that the storyline was interesting, but did not endear itself to the audience. Patrick and crew put in an admirable performance despite their weak and sometimes pathetic dialogue. I thought that we would be treated to something great for their last effort together. I guess that this shows we can all be wrong sometimes. I hope that we will see them together at least one more time; so we can be treated to something more perfect. The television New Generation out does most of what we have seen on the big screen. Although this thought does not include \\"First Contact,\\" which is by far their most perfect endeavor. It is although worth a rental, so that you can be judge and jury for yourself. You are really your best and most trustworthy critic.
B0000640WX|5.0|What can anybody say about Rambo? This movie started a cult following that lives on today. While the actions of Rambo may be unbelievable, this film is extremely important for veterans because it was the groundbreaker in addressing the issue of discrimination of veterans. This movie is not far off base in regards to the welcome that so many of us veterans have faced when we came home - or traveled through small towns. Everybody wants to pick on the &quot;tough military man&quot; (or woman) to &quot;see how tough he really is.&quot; And in the end, everybody suffers for it.<br />This movie should be in every American home. Folks should use it as a learning tool for how not to treat a veteran. I commend the writer for producing this script. We needed it. Thanks.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|hey mates i recommend that you go out and but the soundtrack for this summers blockbuster hit Pirates Of The Cairibbean, this is probably the best soundtrack ive ever heard and everybody who's seen the movie will know whut im talking about....so hurry out and get it today
B000089RVX|5.0|All the songs have meaning and insight on how people actually can be like &quot;Torniquite&quot; and &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;. I liked all the songs and most of them have the difficulties and hardships of peoples lives in them. I would rate this a 5/5 on my top choice list.
1402521154|5.0|Other reviewers have expressed the sheer loveliness of this story.  Having it 'read to you' by someone as adept at the job as this reader is an absolute joy.  It did not feel like someone was reading a book aloud...it felt like Susie was sitting next to me, telling her story.<br />Read the book.  Listen to the audiobook.  Do one, do both, you will not be sorry.
0780627024|5.0|Many of us late-boomer-early buster generation types watched Leave it to Beaver, Mayberry RFD and other such sit-coms that idealized the 1950s.  We often were tempted to think of how nice it would be to live in such times, without broken families, pervasive crudeness, violence, and the general loss of trust in social institutions that pervaded our times.  <br />Pleasantville plays on those feelings by throwing a couple of modern-day teenagers into such a world.  The two respond with opposite approaches.  The young man initially enjoys the nostalgic fantasy, while his sister is bored and frustrated.  Gradually the both come to terms with the limitations and underlying hypocrisies of such portrayals, and then examine their own lives.<br />The use of &quot;color&quot; in the movie is creative and powerful.  The allegory of color as a quest for freedom, and the marrying of that with the civil rights movement of the 1960s proved an ingenious device.  It might have played out a little more subtlely though.<br />Bottom-line:  This is a deceivingly witty, cute film.  It carries layers of nuanced social commentary, sure to sitr much thought.  It rates 5-stars for acting and originality.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Meeting this 25 year-old on an airplane back in March, I had no clue how much talent he possessed.  Gavin's music has so much creativity and originality in it!  It's full of soul and magic that lifts your spirits up.  If you're looking for something to play when you're having a date, this would be your pick.  I recommend this CD to anyone who has a taste in music.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Rob Thomas, Josh Kelly....  You like those guys, you'll love this.  &quot;Follow Through&quot; should be a smash!  Other standouts are Chariot, Just Friends, and Crush.  This is Clive Davis' very own John Mayer so you know the label effort will be strong.  A great voice with great melodic tunes and no too much edge to turn you off - it pop/rock at it's best.
B0000032LS|5.0|You don't have to see the movie to enjoy this soundtrack, oh wait, yes you do. Really though. It's as insane as the movie is, and once you see and hear it, you'll understand why it's got the biggest cult following of anything ever. You eventually become part of the music, addicted, and then are forced to give in to absolute pleasure. You'll start to dream it, and then you'll be it. GREAT SCOTT!!! It's just crazy science fiction. Besides everything else, the music itself really is great. I highly recommend &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. I'm going home.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is a collection that just makes me grin every time I hear it.  It shows you the awesome library of pop that this great harmony group has written.  The best compilation of the Beach Boys ever.  Runs the whole library from the beginning to the Brother period.  You can see how their sound eveolves into the 80's adult sounds.  There audience did grow up, you know.  I loved getting the &quot;Darlin'.&quot;. &quot;Wild Honey: period.  What a bonus.  I could never find these great songs anywhere.  The songs are remixed in stereo and also the mono versions of certain songs.  If they ever come out with an all remixed disc, I'll be the first one on line.  &quot;California Girls&quot;, which starts the disc has a sound that is so awesome that if play it loud it sounds otherworldly.  If you don't know the Beach Boys, this is a fabulous introduction.  If you're a fan, it will put a smile back on your face and will put you back in the surf.  Also Kokomo is just awesome.  Think I'll take a trip to Bermuda.
B000002TLX|4.0|There was a time when &quot;Richard Marx&quot; could do no wrong. He put out &quot;rockers&quot; for the guys, and ballads for the girls. His songs were played at a thousand school dances, and in as many car tape-decks. This is as good as a collection from him could be. I can't think of one song missing. As much as &quot;Don't Mean Nothin'&quot; and &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; take you back to the late 80's, I actually like some of his later stuff more. &quot;Keep Coming Back&quot; is a very smooth and mature song from him, and my favorite song is probably &quot;Hazard&quot;. That songs story is just an excellent and moving piece of music. In short, this is THE cd of his to have for those &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot;.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Without knowing how huge this album was, I bought it at a record store on a spur of the moment. I took it home and played it. Then I played it again. It was rather addictive. Despite no memorable songs I kept playing over and over in my CD player. I still play it about every day.<BR>The music is strange. It's as if it creeps into your mind without you noticing it and it stays there. The first time through it was rather mellow, slow, and unenergetic, but interesting. Upon further inspection, I realized the complexity the music. The art. The mystique. It's as far from exciting as anything, yet it attaches to you.<BR>After many listens I rather much enjoy this album. I don't know quite why, I just do. The aptly named title is quite strange, for whenever I'm doing something like tennis, hanging out, or using the computer, the title keeps on running through my head. I actually enjoy it. It's soothing for some reason or another.<BR>So if I like it so much, why the 4 stars? This is simple. It's clearly good, but not to the point where it is a masterpiece, which it definitely isn't. I love it dearly, but it doesn't have the same impact on me as does Dark Side of The Moon or Forever Changes. It just isn't that great, although it is rather good.<BR>I encourage you to get this album, but only if you can withstand music that isn't quite up-beat.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I have never written a review before, but when I listened to Robbie Williams' wonderful c.d. &quot;Swing When Your Winning&quot; I felt compelled to share how much I love it. He has such an incredible voice and truly does justice to the excellent songs chosen for this c.d. I also highly reccommend the DVD &quot;Live at the Albert&quot;. This has him performing these great swing hits and also includes additional extras. If you watch his performance on the DVD you can see how strongly he cares about these songs and the &quot;swing legacy&quot; and it's really sweet how he gets a bit teary-eyed at the end. It's nice to have music performed by someone who has such a beautiful voice and genuinely cares about what they're singing. I also have his other cd's &quot;SING When You're Winning&quot;, The Ego Has Landed&quot;, and his newest &quot;Escapology&quot;, and I love all of them. I discovered Robbie Williams while watching one of the late shows and was struck by his beautiful voice, the charisma that he has when he performs, and how versatile he is. Robbie Williams is truly gifted.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is an AMAZING soundtrack. I love the pirates theme. This is worth buying. Get it NOW. With bold tunes and BRILLIANT music, this is a must.
B00005JM09|4.0|Better than the first? Maybe even better than T2? I admit, without James Cameron at the helm, and the absence of Linda Hamilton, I thought that T3 would not live up to the hype of the most anticipated movie of the year. Boy was i wrong. T3 delivers all the action and special effects one would hope for in this third sequel. The movie takes place ten years after the events in T2. Two terminators once again, are sent back through time.One to destroy the leader of the resistance, and of course the other to protect the primary target John Connor.Is the world to be saved? Or is the end of mankind inevitable? Arnold, the T101, now an obsulete design, goes head to head with a more forminable opponent, The TX, a far more effective killing machine.Played by the beautiful Kristina Loken. Terminator 3 delivers a great script, with action sequences that will blow you away, with a dash of humor that will make you giggle from time to time. If you see one blockbuster movie this summer, and are a true fan of the terminator series, Do not waite for the video, see it on the big screen.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Okay, let's start off with just saying that I started watching Sex and the City during it's fourth season. After I saw a few episodes, I went to Best Buy and bought The Complete First & Second Seasons of Sex and the City.<br />My eyes were glued to the tv. Side-splitting humor combined with four sexy women and I say you have a winner. One episode after another after another. It never gets old. This show really explores sexuality and what women think about it. I find this show very informative yet funny. Sometimes, I even forget I'm watching a show. I feel like I'm in NYC, with the ladies, talking about sex. <br />When The Complete Third Season came out on DVD, I bought it the first day it was for sale. Still great sexual humor. I couldn't get enough of it. But in the third season, the show started showing a more dramatic side of the characters. Not that I'm saying its bad, I just like it when you can have humor with information, with drama. And not too much drama, just enough.<br />As I was watching The Complete Fourth Season, I began to realize, I'm starting to connect with these characters. Thats amazing! <br />I highly anticipate the fifth and sixth seasons on DVD. The fifth season was short but sassy and comedic. Although I have only seen the first 5 episodes of the sixth and final season, I'm sure it'll be just as good or even better then the last 5 seasons. Though it will be sad to see the ladies go, I'm hoping they'll make a Sex and the City movie, or something to keep us SATC fans going.<br />So if you're out there...contemplating whether or not you should buy any of the show's DVDs, don't think twice about it, order them NOW. I recommend you order all so you can get the full \\"dose\\" of the show. So please, order the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons of this wonderful and fabulous show.
B00005YW4H|1.0|This has got to be the most overhyped record of all time. It sounds like one long soulless monotone track from the beginning to the end.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I saw Pirates of the Caribbean opening day and I'll admit I wondered if the music would hold up the movie any. I was totally proven wrong, Badelt and team have done extermely well with this score, it really gets your blood pumping when watching the fight scenes and hearing the rousing music in the background, track 2, 7 and 11 are some of my favs. Many music reviews will bash this soundtrack saying its too much bass and sounds too much like a Zimmer score well I'd say to them it works with this movie sure its not a period film its not meant to be its a movie that makes fun of itself so why can't the score be something unexpected, if it works and gets you more into the movie then it has accomplished its goal. This score really adds to the movie in many ways, if your a fan of The Rock or Gladiator, or if you got into the music when seeing the movie pick up this soundtrack, my only disappointment in the cd was it was too short only 43 minutes long, but it does have all the big themes from the film.
6305910340|5.0|I really love this movie.  It has a lot of wonderful points to make about the gifts children have and the way adults have to work to discover them, nurture the child while developing the gifts, teaching the child about using their gifts, but not going too far and not latching onto the child and living through them.<br />The film is at its most touching when Josh struggles and the adults in his life struggle even more to try and find ways to help him.  Finally, the dad (superbly played by Joe Montegna) lets Josh off the hook and takes him fishing.  Josh then returns to competition and can take possession of his gift and competitiveness on his own terms.<br />In real life, Josh Waitzkin has been a superb, but not dominant chess player, but I gather he has led a happy life which should be enough for everyone and is really the point of things, not gathering trophies or empty titles.  Josh learns a bit about the cruelty of real life competition in a painful but not destructive way.<br />Yet, of course, the film has the final crisis against a very threatening opponent.  I am sure you can figure out what happens.  But this final scene isn't really the message of the movie, it is just the ending.<br />Laurence Fishburne has a great role he plays wonderfully.  Joan Allen is great as the loving and intelligent mother who is protective but not over protective.  And Ben Kingsley plays Bruce Pandolfini who is the teacher of Josh.  I do not know what was made dramatic for the movie and what is drawn from real life.  But it doesn't matter.  What do matter are the real life lessons the movie portrays in such a tender and beautiful way.  Just glorious.
0618002227|2.0|Get this into your head, all you detail-loving syphilis infected fiends: NOT ALL CLASSICS ARE GOOD. Just because this is a &quot;timeless classic&quot;, doesn't mean you have to enjoy it. I started this book, and I couldn't stand it. I stopped on about page forty...which, in my version, was about page 10. Way too much detail. This book is lugubrious and boring. I can't stand it; I tried to enjoy it. I even started reading it again a few months ago. But it's just too damn detailed. I can't stand it. <br />Remember: NOT ALL CLASSICS ARE GOOD. I can't believe this was rated with 4.5 stars. NO disrepected to JRR, but...too much detail. This book could have easily been 100 pages long.
0780020685|5.0|This movie is justly hailed as one of the great movies of all time.  The story is wonderful, the acting is fine, the music is moody and appropriate, and the photography is fabulous in adding to the drama and emotion of the story.  And though it is 3 hours and 27 minutes in length, it doesn't feel long.  The time is used for interesting character development and to enrich the story by connecting us with the characters and their struggles.  Just compare the richness of this film with &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and you will have to admit that the remake, while good, is inferior largely because of the cuts that needed to be made to keep the movie to two hours.<br />The misery of the villagers and loneliness of the samurai are palpable.  The small and dusty village aches of poverty and desperation and the samurai always seem aware that they are a feared necessity to the farmers and will never be accepted or even justly thanked.<br />The bandits are a mass force of nature about to once again take everything from the farmers but their lives.  We don't get to know any of them beyond the way they dress and this mass energy makes them even more threatening and fearsome.  After being beaten down by the bandits for so long, the farmers decide, at least tentatively, to fight or die.  The old man of the village sends them to the city to recruit hungry but strong samurai.  The recruitment scenes are a classic in introducing us to seven heroes and their varying characters.<br />When the samurai arrive at the village and no one comes to greet them we see the beginning of the fracture and the residual fear of the peasants.  The fortification of the village and the training of the farmers for battle add to the rich character development of the movie.  There is even a wonderful scene on the harvest before the fields are flooded.  Can you imagine the luxury such a scene in a Hollywood film?  But it adds so much to our understanding of these characters that it is worth the extra time and more.<br />Then comes the first skirmish quickly followed by the three amazing battles and the nights between.  The camera work here keeps us breathless with the speed at which the fighting happens.  The camera work keeps it all close and personal.  Pain, fear, anguish, and courage fill the frame throughout these unforgettable scenes.<br />There is so much to talk about in this movie that these little reviews are really not enough.  This is a fabulously restored disk with a few extras (but who cares - it is this wonderful movie that makes the disk worth everything).  &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is a movie I never tire of watching and always lets me find new things to enjoy.

0786915749|5.0|OK,yes, the magical fantasy world thing has been done before, but never like this.Wies and Hickman have a wonderful way of putting you right in the middle of the action. The story is complex and detailed. It leaves you wanting to know  more about the world of Krynn and it's inhabitants. The charectors are complex too-from the grim and slightly evil mage, Raistlin to the light-hearted kender, Tasselhoff Burrfoot (my personal favorite). This story isn't all blood and battle either-there's also love and friendship and brotherhood. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoyes fantasy/science fiction novels. I know you'll enjoy it-it certainly has me hooked!
B00005V9HA|5.0|Being able to replicate life and bring the dead back has been an issue on the tongues of men since the beginning of written history. Men have searched for fountains of youth, cures that could capture time in a bottle and keep it from closing in, so that death could somehow be cheated. Some have even claimed to find answers to this riddle, too, but man still hasn't gained a foothold on that elusively captivating plateau. So, it is the pursuit of many a scientific mind, not to mention the joke of many an academic philosopher. Still, what if one could actually accomplish such a feat, developing a glowing green formula that can reanimate the dead? Impossible, you say? Well, meet Herbert West, the newest member of Miskatonic University and herald of strange theories that many professors, Dr. Carl Hill being the worst of them, find agitating. Enter Dan Cain, a man with a need for a roommate that West provides, and things quickly spin out-of-control.<br />Were I making an adaptation of a Lovecraftian tale and doing it correctly, something that I think this version of ReAnimator does o so well, I might not have picked Jeffrey Combs as my Herbert West. Why not, you ask, knowing that he was perfectly suited for the role and that this was the benchmark set for Lovecraftian imitations. Because I'm not someone who picks the cast, of course, and my eyes would have been blind to the talent at hand. Still, Combs was perfect for the part and someone did notice that, and the ensemble around him was picked with a sharp eye as well. This resulted in a group that experienced the awe and the strangely frightening effects that bringing the dead back can gravitate towards; from the screeches of a newly-reborn cat to the ranting of a severed head. Convincingly, they helped forge one of my favorite films of all time.<br />If you, by some fluke of nature, have yet to see this movie, seek out someone to blame for this travesty and promptly punish them. Making them listen to many a pop artist would quite possibly suffice, and perhaps making them watch some reality television will hurt them even more. I know it sounds harsh but, after watching the movie, you'll agree that they deserve it all and then more. This is because this movie has it all, from the comedy that Gordon so willfully whips up to the strange ways a certain young Dr. West carries himself with. If you have seen it and think that perhaps you've seen it in all its glory, perhaps you, too, should watch it again, this time tuning into the more clarified DVD version. Here, the move takes on a new light, looking better than I ever remember it looking, and some of the extras are bad as well.would quite possibly suffice, and perhaps making them watch some reality television will hurt them even more.

0380789035|4.0|This is an enjoyable book that crosses back and forth over the line between reality and \\"this couldn't possibly be true...but is.\\"  The cultural observations are astute if not acerbic and the \\"gods\\" with their ordinaryness and powers are excellently.  The author excels in sustaining suspicion throughout the novel as we wonder if what we dare think could be true really is.  This is a tale that shimmers just beneath the surface where most of the action lies.<br />The only problem is the main character.  He never becomes as real as the other characters, perhaps due to his utterly boring persona.  Still, the story of Americans who just happened to be ancient gods who play scrabble, bowl and argue is captivating.  The earth-shaking finale has parallels with many others - Buffy the Vampire, Mortal Combat, X-Men - all, by the way, as American as apple pie.
B00000JZJ0|5.0|Bringing the dead back to life. It is the dream of many scientists, the want of suddenly loveless lovers, and the hope of every heart that has ever hurt when someone has passed. And it is also something that, as Dr. Herbert West has proven with his \\"testing,\\" can be done with a limited degree of success. Eight months ago, Miskatonic university was the proving ground to this theory, giving results that proved that life could be brought back. Unfortunately, however, this knowledge was not with its costs. Before everything was said and done, the university had lost its figurehead, Dan Cain has lost his girlfriend, others lost their lives, and a severed head was running around bent on domination.<br />Well, Herbert West is back again, bringing along with him the infamous Dan Cain, bent on trying to turn reanimation into an exact science. And this leads to some interesting discoveries, such as the fact that limbs can be given life individually and then placed together as one entity, and that there could be a chance that something once lost - Cain's girlfriend - could be brought back from the grave.<br />While this carrying his name would probably sicken Lovecraft, the movie was actually something that I found enjoyable for a number of reasons.<br />First, there was simply the bizarre nature of it all. The character of West, played by Jeffrey Combs, is done with a precision that few could match. In it, he is a man that is bent on breaking the codex of known scientific law by doing something remarkable; taking life to a place that it has never been before. While doing this, the things that he decides to give life are simply hilarious, such as the fingers and the eyes combinations and the piecemeal creation that is to be his masterpiece.<br />Secondly, it isn't as B-movie as I thought it would have been, keeping me laughing enough with its production quality and the smoothly refreshing taste it left in my mouth to make me feel like I had seen something worthwhile. Perhaps that is because I am a little bias when it comes to Jeffrey Combs, but I don't think so. Then again, I'm not sure the bias ever truly think they are.<br />Third, the movie is simply funny. The premise, while out there and a little gory, finds itself mixing it up with an old favorite that had been left in pieces but that can still function if given that lovely fluid, and Dr. Hill is always fun at any party. So, put it all together and you have a continuation of the oddities that the first movie stopped short of.<br />If you are someone looking for a movie Lovecraftian style, then this may or may not be something for you - depending on how your sense of humor is. If you could simply imagine Herbert West continuing on, doing some of the things that he would no doubt end up doing, then you'll be fine. If, however, you need a by the books Lovecraftian tale, then this wouldn't be something that you would find enjoyable. If you are someone that caught the Reanimator and missed this, then it is a good way to laugh a little and follow Combs as he furthers the plight of the oddity everyone would grow to love if given the chance; one Herbert West.t is because I am a little bias when it comes to Jeffrey Combs, but I don't think so.

B000099T2L|5.0|This is one of my best cds. Just about every song is good. You could put the cd in and won't have to skip a track. My favorite songs are Crazy In Love, Baby Boy, Be With You, Signs, That's How You Like It, and Dangerously In Love 2. This is a good investment. Like Missy says &quot;Cop That Sh*t.&quot;
0385335482|5.0|I will admit that I judged this book by its cover.  I saw it on the shelf and picked it up because it was about shopping.  I can really relate to it because I love to shop.  Becky Bloomwood, the main character, is out of control with her spending habits.  This is what makes the book so funny.  I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait to read &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.&quot;  I reccommend this book to anyone who loves to shop.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I myself always buy the soundtracks to films that I see because the score accentuates it so much more. This soundtrack is wonderful. It's loud, eerie, and so much more. You can picture the scenes and the emotions from the film, making you almost apart of the film. Klaus Badelt does a wonderful job creating imagery of piracy, swordfights, and most of all fun with every note. It's wonderful to listen to on a long drive, going for a run, or just sitting around. Highly recommended, even if you didn't enjoy the film.
B00003CXIY|3.0|Though this isn't the best movie made, it has some funny parts.  Those who like dirty humor will love &quot;Road Trip&quot;.  This is a movie that you don't have to think about what's happening.  They reveal everything so people all ages will understand.  Breckin Meyer, Tom Green, Seann William Scott, etc. are okay at their acting, nothing spectacular.  Many events don't fit very well, but it's still funny.  <br />&quot;Road Trip&quot; isn't anywhere close to Oscar worthy, but it's still entertaining.  It can be a good lay-back movie.
6305897786|1.0|This movie is an adaptation of the book \\"The Club Dumas\\" by Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte.  Read the book a while back and was totally absorbed.  Saw this movie, and regretted it.  While Depp is truly a great actor, his portrayal of the main character, Dean Corso, was weak at best, but that's not his fault.  It's the fault of the screenplay itself.  This movie fails tremendously to capture the dark brooding mood of the main character and any insight into what drives him.  If the movie seems to amble along and then suddenly there's this \\"plot\\" going on, it's because all of the book's sub-plots that lay the groundwork, are missing.  Those sub-plots are crucial.  They define the characters and the reasons why everyone is chasing a particular book.  The relationship of the characters is based upon other motives not established in the movie.  Without them, everything's just trite and banal which is exactly what this movie is.  If you have NOTHING to do, and want to kill time, then maybe ok.  But if you are looking for a film that rivets you and intrigues you to venture into the world of Dean Corso and his cohorts, then skip this altogether and just buy the book.  Let the book and your imagination work for you.
0385504209|5.0|I did not want to put this book down!  It was a fast paced, educational read.

In the meantime, I'm going to read toher books about the subject matter of The Da Vinci Code.
1563896656|5.0|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is an utterly delightful book. In it, writer Alan Moore assembles a superhero team of a completely different sort, drawing on British literary figures of the late 1800s. Writing in a style reminiscent of that era, Moore has crafted a superb story that stands with the classics of adventure, science fiction and a bit of the grotesque.<br />Some people might be completely lost after reading pages where the only text is dialogue in Arabic, Chinese or French -- but the story is plain for all to see, brought to life through the art of Kevin O'Neill, whose work supercedes the language barrier and evokes turn-of-the-century thrills and chills. Ben Dimagmaliw is a perfect match, employing a muted palate in his coloration.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|this cd is so awesome i love the main theme!!! Klaus badelt is so cool!!!! Just like the movie this is the best soundtrack this summer and the movie like i said is the best movie this summer it might even be the best movie this year!!!
B000002I2G|4.0|The Soft Parade is a radically different album than anything in their catalog. It is their only album to predominantly feature horns and strings. It is also arguably their weakest collection of songs with Jim Morrison. Nonetheless, it's still a pretty good album featuring a few very underrated tracks.<br />&quot;Touch Me&quot; is the big hit from the album and easily one of their best singles of their career. The song still sounds great today on classic rock and oldies radio. There are several other strong tracks on this album that don't get the recognition they deserve. &quot;Shaman's Blues&quot; is an very strong track featuring an excellent keyboard solo and featuring some of Robby Krieger's best soloing, particularly in the last verse. &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; is a slower track featuring some of Jim Morrison's best poetic lyrics and vocals. The strings dominate the track but like the aforementioned &quot;Touch Me&quot; only add to the song rather than clutter it. The same can be said for &quot;Runnin' Blue&quot;, another decent track featuring some great drumming from John Densmore. The album's other tracks are all decent, but for different reasons are not up to par. &quot;Tell All The People&quot; would have been a stronger track if the horns weren't so upfront in the mix. The title track is a return to the album-ending long track from their first two albums. While the song is quite diverse, it's not as memorable as &quot;The End&quot; from their first album. Other tracks such as &quot;Do It&quot; and &quot;Wild Child&quot; are okay, but don't stand out with the latter sounding too reminiscent of their earlier work. A decent album, definitely a change of pace. Newcomers may want to check out The Doors or Morrison Hotel first before working their way to this album.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was probably one of the first novels I read during this time period. The first time I read it, I was amazed by the eloquent but simple writing of Jane Austen. The second time I read it, I was astounded by the way the charactors were portrayed. The third time I read it, I was blown away by the plot, and the rich detials and descriptions that surrounded her story. Since then, every time I read it I am more and more captivated by the certain truthfulness and plain exertion of human nature. The writing is of incredible quality. I would say that this novel is one of the best I have ever read, second only to Les Miserables.
0553562355|4.0|Though this story was interesting and kept me turning pages, I found Bob, the protagonist, difficult to sympathize with. He deeply loves his wife, yet he gives no good reason for having been unfaithful to her. Segal seems to want the reader to believe that Bob is a good man who has only been unfaithful this one time (an interlude that lasted for a few days rather than a more excusable single crazy incident), but how is the reader supposed to reconcile his supposedly honest nature and passionate love for his wife with his actions? Perhaps this novel is supposed to draw sympathy and understanding for human weakness, but what it actually ends up doing is chipping away at the reader's faith in true love by saying that even the most in-love of couples would cheat if it were unlikely they would ever be caught.

B000002UY5|5.0|Like many people have said, Blind Melon has to be one of the most underrated bands of the 90's. Vocalist Shannon Hoone overtakes alot of my favorite vocalists. This CD is an example of what Blind Meloc can do. &quot;No Rain&quot; is one of the best songs I've ever heard, it is on eof the songs that made them get the fame they did aswell. &quot;Soak The Sin&quot; is a great example of what Shannon Hoone can do aswell. In my mind this album deserves more credit than it got. Has to be one of the greatest albums I've ever heard.

0375414053|4.0|This was an enjoyable book by Allison Pearson that takes a more than humorous look at society, motherhood, family and marriage.  Kate Reddy is a character that the reader cheers for, loathes, envies and grieves for all at the same time. She is a somewhat over the top working mom who is continually juggling her career, family and marriage and feeling that she is less than successful at any one.  At work she feels like an imposter, at home she feels like an inferior mom and in her marriage she feels exasperated.  Throughout the book, Kate searches as we all do for who she really is. She makes decisions and puts herself in situations that appall me such as; thoughts about an affair, leaving a sick child, jealousy over her nanny, admitting how stifled she feels by the neediness of her children and her  feelings of inadequacies around stay at home mothers.  This is the beauty of this novel.  It arouses feelings that all mothers have regardless if they work or stay home.  When does it become okay for a mom to be a woman who enjoys more than caretaking.  These are questions that people feel very strongly about including Kate Reddy.  The struggles that she goes through in the novel are written in a humorous and sometimes heartbreaking manner by Pearson.  At one point Kate describes her mixed feelings about motherhood \\"The need of children is never-ending.  At what point is it all right to say when.  Never.  And to serve so selfessly, you have to subdue something in yourself.  I admire the women who can do it, but the mere thought makes me sick with panic.\\"  Is Kate loathsome because she admits her weaknesses?  Is she a better woman for following her heart?  Do her children suffer because of her actions?  Does her marriage?  Does she?  Yes to all and the heartbreaking reality of Kate Reddy is that no one can really have it all and each of us must struggle with their own definition of what works in their life.  A very inciteful book written in a humorous way that makes accurate observations about life for women in the workplace, at home and in marriage.  Well done!rate observations about life for women in the workplace, at home and in marriage.  Well done!
079073804X|5.0|When I first saw this movie a few years ago, I got so scared that I couldn't sleep for a few nights in fear that my bed would start to shake.<br />This has to be one of the scariest movies of all time, but one of the best I have ever seen in the horror genre.  Linda Blair gives a stunning performance as Regan, a twelve year old girl who gets possessed by a demon.  I still cannot get over how such a young girl could be in such a scary movie such as this.<br />When my family and I sat down to watch it, the music that filled the room gave me the chills.  Just hearing it scared me and I almost walked out of the room, but was drawn into the movie.<br />The main suggestion that I want to make is that you do NOT watch this movie alone!  Trust me, it is one movie that you will never forget.
B00005OCMR|5.0|When Tron came out in 1982, it was intended to be a visually stunning parable against the powers of computers and technology. More than twenty years later, the movie plays more like a nostalgic ode to the early 1980s, than a simple good vs. evil morality tale. Tron evokes the heady days when video games like Pac Man, Defender and Centipede ruled the arcades and when everyone owned a Commodore 64 or an Atari 2600 -- the eight track of personal computing.<br />Writer/director Steven Lisberger creates a flashy, neon-drenched world, a cybernetic version of Social Darwinism where lowly computer programs must participate in gladiatorial battles against the Master Control's ruthless minions. Even though the computer effects look primitive now, back then they were considered ahead of their time. Fortunately, Lisberger has not remastered the special effects with contemporary computer graphics (take note George Lucas). There is a certain clunky charm to the effects that makes Tron all that more endearing to its fans.<br />Tron is one of those rare examples where style over substance works. The computer world that Lisberger and his team worked so hard to create is rich in detail. It also plays on our romantic notions of what really goes on inside our computers -- not a collection of microchips and circuit boards but a vast world where programs fight each other for survival. It's no wonder that visionary science fiction writer, William Gibson once commented in an interview that the cyberworld in Tron is how he envisioned the cyberspace in his novels.<br />The audio commentary with director Steven Lisberger, producers Donald Kushner and Harrison Ellenshaw, and special effects wizard, Richard Taylor. There is a relaxed feel to the track as these guys reminisce about working on the movie. The commentary does tend to lean more towards the technical aspects of making the movie as opposed to anecdotal content but the documentary on disc two covers this aspect in more detail.<br />Disc two features a wealth of supplemental material that was mostly carried over from a special edition laserdisc set that Disney released many years ago. The DVD reorganizes all of these extras into several easily navigable sections.<br />The best extra on the second disc is a comprehensive 90-minute documentary entitled, &quot;The Making of Tron.&quot; Every aspect of the movie, from its humble origins to the struggles of getting it made are covered with brand new interviews with Lisberger and his crew and Jeff Bridges and the cast (minus David Warner). Everyone speaks fondly of his or her experiences working on Tron. This retrospective look at the movie 20 years later is a real treat for the fans and is the crowning touch on this excellent set.sc two features a wealth of supplemental material that was mostly carried over from a special edition laserdisc set that Disney released many years ago.

B000002UAO|5.0|This Rubber Soul is the ORIGINAL version, the one that was released in the UK. So, if anyone who thought that what they listened to in '65 (in the US) was the real Rubber Soul, you're wrong. I am 20 years old, and the only Rubber Soul I knew was the UK cd that I bought. When I saw the US album at a friends house, I was shocked to see the songs on it! The US album companies completely messed with the Beatles' albums by cutting and slicing their work so they could put fewer songs on the US versions. This is why there are more US Beatles albums that UK ones. This is also why you find songs from the original HELP! soundtrack (It's only love, etc.) on the US Rubber Soul release. The US Rubber Soul is really a lot of random songs stuck togther, as were most of the early US Beatles albums. So for those complaining about how Rubber Soul is, remember, the UK cd is how it was meant to be heard. And by the way, it is excellent. How could anyone not like hearing the first notes of Drive My Car? To me, this CD is a classic, and it sounds perfect how it is. I feel sorry for the Beatles fans in the US during the '60s, because they were cheated out of hearing the Beatles' albums the way they were meant to be heard. (at least until Sgt. Pepper) This CD is essential to anyone's Beatles' collection. It goes especially well with Revolver, which is often considered &quot;part 2&quot; of Rubber Soul.
B000068OSK|5.0|Like most people, I first heard of The White Stripes through White Blood Cells. I loved that album so much that I had to buy all of their albums. Out of them all, their self-titled one remains my favourite.<br />Starting off with a rockin' tune, \\"Jimmy the Exploder,\\" and ripping through a blistering cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Stop Breaking Down,\\" this album does not disappoint. It has a more bluesy, minimalist feel than WBC which was a bit catchier -- in a good way, of course.<br />The other stand-outs, for me, on this album are \\"The Big Three Killed My Baby,\\" which is about car manufacturers but I always interpreted it was Jack's comment on big record labels killing good music. I guess you could interpret the lyrics in all sorts of ways. \\"Suzy Lee\\" has a wonderful bluesy vibe that feels like you're in the Deep South. \\"Astro\\" is a wonderfully punky tune that is short and sweet. And then you have a really unusual cover of Bob Dylan's \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" which The White Stripes remake in their own style.<br />If you love The White Stripes but haven't picked up this album yet then I highly recommend checking this one out. It's a more stripped down version of the band (if that's possible) and exposes their blues roots in the most amazing way.

0385504209|5.0|Jacques Saunierre is a curator at the Louvre Museum in Paris. He is murdered by a giant albino assassin who is seeking knowledge of an ancient secret which has been entrusted to Jacques and just three other men. The albino tells Jacques that the other three are already dead. Before Jacques dies he tries to leave enough clues near his body so that the secret can be passed on to the two people he trusts the most to guard it. One is agent  Sophie Neveu who is a cryptographer and also his granddaughter. The other is Robert Langdon, a professor of religious symbology at Harvard, who is presently staying at the Paris Ritz.<br />Langdon is called to the murder scene because his name is written on a message left by the murder victim. Sophie arrives soon after because the case requires a cryptographer. Sophie figures out that the message left by Jacques is meant for both her and Langford. She also knows that Langford is the chief suspect and he will shortly be put in jail. Since she needs his help in unraveling the clues left by Jacques, Sophie leads Langford out of the Louvre through an emergency exit. Together they set off to follow the clues and it soon becomes clear to them that their real quest is the Holy Grail.<br />There are others in pursuit of the same prize such as the famous British historian Sir Leigh Teabring as well as Bishop Manuel Aringarosa of the Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei.<br />THE DA VINCI CODE is in the best tradition of detective and thriller fiction. The mystery is complicated but the author explains the intricate solution in detail as the plot unfolds. The story may seem a little too imaginative at times but that is exactly what makes the book so entertaining.

0375414053|3.0|While Pearson does a remarkable job of describing the nearly impossible juggling act that is required of working mothers, I wish she had created a character that I could sympathize with. I couldn't stand Kate Reddy. She was horrible to her husband, condescending to her co-workers, and short-tempered with her children. When she began her email adultery, I absolutely couldn't stand her anymore. I just kept thinking that the whole family would be better off without her.<br />As a single mother myself, I was thrilled to see such a talented author illustrate the complexity of managing career and family--- except that Kate didn't really manager her family. Instead, she criticized the way her husband and nanny did things. By the time the novel ended, I didn't care what Kate did. I just felt sorry for everyone who had to live with her.
B00009L1TA|1.0|Anyone who has ever had any experience with the Army should be appalled by this movie.  Let me just point out a few things that were.....missed.<br />1. Soldiers do not wear there beret's when on a mission in the jungle, or any field mission for that matter.<br />2. When Sergent West (Samuel L. Jackson)is yelling at his soldiers in formation, he is wearing the rank of a Specialist, which is a demotion by at least 4 ranks.  Not to mention that his sunglasses are out of regulation.<br />3. Soldiers in dress green uniform,(army investigater, played by Connie Nielsen) do not wear combat boots with thier pants bloused unless they're in an airborn unit and have earned the right to do so. Also, this caracter never wears head gear, which is required in the regulation any time a soldier is outdoors and in uniform.<br />Overall, I thought that the story line was a good one, but I am offended that these film makers, with all of their resources and money, could get these simple and minor details completely wrong. (Sergents stripes cost about $2.00 at your Military Clothing and Sales Store on any Military Installation world wide!)
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory is exellant. Both the band, a nu-metal act, and the album have quickly become favorites of mine.  The main criticism of Linkin Park is that they are an inpersonation of Limp Bizkit.  This is not a fair argument: just because they both play the same genre of music does not mean Linkin Park is a rip-off imitator.  For that matter, while I might be considered a casual fan of Limp Bizkit, I feel that Linkin Park is an infinately superior group. I love their rap-metal genre blending & their multi-layering vocals.<br />On with a review of the tracks: (rated out of 5 stars)<BR>#1- Papercut. 5/5. It has a nice, melodic feel to it along with the rough guitars. The song seems to be discussing the questioning of one's abilities and rationale. It has a great hook; I found the lyrics insightful and retrospective.<br />#2- One Step Closer, 5/5. A hit single. Great vocals. A song that vents anger and frustration.<br />#3- With You, 5/5. About the struggling within a realationship; touches on appearance vs. reality theme. Nice, haunting vocals.<br />#4- Points of Authority, 5/5. Song seems to be response to a sadistic & controling relationship partner. Uses rap hooks.<br />#5- Crawling, 5/5. Also a hit single and the song that really caught my ear. This is one of the albums stand-out tracks, with the song alluding to insecurity and feelings of insanity. My second fave song on the album.<br />#6- Runaway, 5/5. Another great, fast-paced rocker. Another stand-out song & it's my favorite track.<br />#7- By Myself, 4/5. A song that questions the importance of being sociable or reliance on your self.<br />#8- In the End, 5/5. Another hit song. I love it; it's very emotional, talking about putting effort and failing to get results<br />#9- A Place for my Head, 5/5. Very cool guitar riffs. Another song discussing relationships, this time with someone who's too demanding, while he just wants some peace. It's very rap-oriented at parts. It's quite dramatic, and strong & forceful, especially at the end.<br />#10- Forgotten, 5/5. About a failed relationship and the memories left from it. <br />#11- Cure for this Itch, 5/5. This track is an instrumental. The first 30 seconds or so are odd & you can't really tell what's going on, but overall it's very interesting. It incorporates the use of synthesizers, percussion, as well as orchestration and piano.<br />#12- Pushing Me Away, 4/5. About realizing that he's foolishly been wasting his time in a bad relationship and knowing that he needs to get out. <br />All and all this is a great album. 5 stars. Hope this review is helpful, though I know that at points I really couldn't think of anyway to describe the music in words.<BR>Also, if you're not sure if you'd like this group, I think you should give the album a listen. At first I didn't think I'd like them either but now (as I've already said) both the band and this album are among my favorites.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Is there anything valid in the remark about the Zeppelin DVD ?:<br />Bootleg videos of the vast majority of this material has been floating around for years, and having seen much of it, I can vouch for the astounding restoration work this set represents. On the other hand, they saw fit to reedit nearly all the sequences to a 90's MTV aesthetic. Where the original may show a 10 second shot of Page's hands playing a solo, this version will feature 4 or 5 fast intercuts to footage of Plant clapping (culled from earlier in the set), digitally fuzzified and pseudo-shakycam versions of the original shot of Page's handwork, an audience shot culled from another show, another shot of Plant digitally slowed down in an attempt to make his clapping sync with the audio, etc., etc., ad infinitum. <br />In some instances it's apparent that this was done to cover minor glitches (probably unrestorable) in the video, but the vast majority of the embellishment is in sequences with excellent quality. The fuzzy faux-shakycam treatment is particularly galling, since it's such a cliche in recent MTV fare and obscures some truly lovely passages. I'm not expecting an historical document, so I have no problem with the usual monkeying with the set order or the merciful editing of Plant's traditional lengthy (and quite stoned) patter between songs, but every time one of these 'improved' segments kicks in I'm left longing for the beautiful set that would have remained had the producers stopped after the restoration process.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is a funky rock band...or a rockin' funk band...either way, it's worth a listen.  The first single, \\"Harder to Breathe\\", is self-prophetic--you find yourself gasping for breath after hearing the sexy tune and magnetic lyrics.  \\"Not Coming Home\\" is a great live cut, and \\"Tangled\\" has a way of settling pleasantly in your ear.  Excellent release.  This band is hot.
B000001E3V|5.0|After I listen to Clapton's recent work, I'm always pulling out my Dominoes cds. He was truly a great blues rock guitarist. He just plays the same riffs over and over these days. But back then he was something. I also have to disagree with Mindy from New York. She said D.Allman laid down the better solos on the lp. Listen to the first 3 songs, there is no Allman on I Looked Away, Bell Bottom Blues and Keep On Growing. Clapton plays incredible overdubs on K O Growing and I Looked Away. Also if you listen to the begining of Key to the Highway, Clapton plays the intro solo, then turns it over to Allman. Who plays a couple of notes with his slide then procedes to think better of it and turns it back to a smoking Clapton. Who then makes the hair on your next stand with his blues riffs. All this before he sings one line of the song. Allmans contribution cannot be denied though. Especially on Claptons masterpiece itself, Layla. I guess its all a matter of opinion, but to say Allman's solos were the best on the album is crazy!!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A lot of science fiction series bill themselves as \\"space westerns.\\" From \\"Star Trek\\" on down, the parallels have been drawn between cowboys exploring the American frontier, and starships exploring the new frontiers of the galaxy. However, \\"Firefly\\" may be the first series to successfully merge the two genres so completely, and in such an innovative way.<br />Creator Joss Whedon (\\"Buffy\\", \\"Angel\\"), along with producers Ben Edlund (\\"The Tick\\") and Tim Minear (\\"Angel\\") have created a world full of both space ships and cowboys that co-exist in perfect logic, if not always harmony. Audiences are drawn into the lives of a group of nine men and women aboard a small smuggling ship called Serenity.<br />\\"Firefly\\" has a lived in feel. The audience joins the story in progress, six years after the war, and gets introduced to the universe bit by bit in a very natural way. The production design is a lot more \\"Star Wars\\" than \\"Star Trek,\\" with grime and miss-matched parts, from the dining room chairs to the occasionally jury-rigged engines. The characters speak English peppered with Mandarin (mostly swear words and slang), with voices that from episode one are distinct and unique. Each character is perfectly drawn, full of quirks and depth. With scripts that effortlessly segue from humour to drama to romance, the series' life was cut short by FOX after a fall season full of pre-emptions and poor advertising. However, this highly-anticipated extra-laden box set which not only includes all 14 episodes (including 3 unaired episodes) with cast and creator commentaries, interviews, promises to be a huge hit with both fans and folks who may have missed this ground-breaking series first time around.<br />It may no longer be on the air in the States, but recently airing in the UK and Mexico and South America, and with rumours of a big screen movie in the future, \\"Firefly\\" is still flying so far as its millions of fans are concerned.
B000060MY6|3.0|It is likely that this movie has busted several of my brain cells during just the first half hour.  My brain now feels like I have suffered a terrible car accident almost like Rita's or Camilla's or whoever she is, after seeing the movie several times last week. The movie slowly manifests almost nothing that will suffice for what is needed to somewhat enjoy the movie.  I have finally figured out the movie to some extent but still feel like I am missing something important.  The movie is a bit boring, so I have had difficulty paying atention to what I need in order to get things straight.  Besides all this, the film doesn't offer anything unique like I expected. I also felt that the acting wasn't...believable enough. The only reason I gave 'Mulholland Drive' three stars was because the plot has great potential and I laughed like a little demon baby several times during some serious scenes like; the strange black 'thing' in the alley, the random lesbian scene(which I now sort of understand) and the maniacal film directors wife.
0375422307|5.0|Read Satrapi's &quot;Persepolis.&quot;  Graphic novels like Satrapi have raised the standard for a genre formerly reserved for lighter, pulpier subjects.  In recent years, we have seen -and hopefully read- &quot;Palestine&quot; by Joe Sacco, and &quot;Safe Area Gorazde,&quot; by the same author (about the war in Bosnia); &quot;Berlin&quot; by Jason Lutes, and of course the masterful &quot;Maus&quot; by Art Spiegelman.<BR>What is it about the cartoon art employed by these writers/illustrators that makes their subjects approachable and meaningful at the same time?  Perhaps the genre has to go under another name, a new one, especially since the subject matter by each artist is linked to the other by its gravity: the Holocaust, the Iranian Revolution, the Palestinian Situation, the Bosnian War.  Poignant scenes have been etched in ink; families torn away within the confines of a comic book panel; victims' screams emitted through dialogue balloons.  The subjects are far from being trivialized.

B00008OWZC|5.0|O.K.  Hundreds of reviews later, I can't add much of anything of substance that hasn't already been (rightfully) said.  Back when Rolling Stone was a real magazine that mattered, Led Zeppelin was the BAND that mattered.  If this 3-cd (Lp) set would have been released, say, in the heyday of Page, Plant, et. al; the review might have been like this:  You're flipping through the pages of the latest issue.  You reach a section that is nothing but white.  No print.  No pictures.  White.  You flip two or three blank pages and come to the centerfold.  There in very small print centered on the page is the two-word review of this album by the then Definitive Rolling Stone Staff.  It reads...&quot;My God.&quot;  Period. John Bonham, Jimmy Page, John Paul-Jones, Robert Plant.  Celebrate Definitive Rock &amp; Roll History people and own this.  It is Rock &amp; Roll Heaven.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|'Requiem for a Dream' is by far one of the most depressing films I've ever...experienced. The entire film is a whirlwind of unique camera angles, vibrant colors and beautiful cinematography. This film is truly like nothing I have ever exprienced. It wraps viewers into the highs and lows of four different characters that all share the unfortunate addiction of drug abuse.  However, I must say that I was skeptical as to how the plot of this film was weak, but soon enough after seeing the film's entirety, it has much to offer. 'Requiem for a Dream' isn't exactly something viewers may want to watch numorous times, but is definately something to recommend to friends or anyone interested in something disturbing yet powerful. A definite must buy.
0385504209|5.0|This novel hinges on a fascinating alternative history of Christianity.  Whether it has any merit in reality is another issue altogether, but the story-line is truly engaging.  Hidden within the works of Da Vinci are clues to another story of Christ; one banned by the Church in its early days to solidify its power base and to make its message consistent to followers.  Documents (e.g., the Gnostic Gospels) and artifacts relating to this &quot;other history&quot; were destroyed, its leaders killed and any records of its existence purged.<br />Playing large roles in the story are obscure but interesting (and real) societies such as Opus Dei - the orthodox Vatican prelature - and the secret society called the Priory of Sion, founded in 1099.  Weaving in generous portions of real events, artwork, historical biography, Brown does a wonderful job depicting the power struggle over control of Christianity.<br />Playing lesser roles to the historical background are the protagonists, including symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu.  These two - and the &quot;action side&quot; of the plot - require that the reader suspend belief occasionally... since when does a French police detective have authority to do enforce laws within the borders of England, for instance?  But these players are all subjugated by the astounding historical backdrop.  Truly fascinating and well-written - the Da Vinci Code is certainly worth reading.  It is unlikely you will put it down until you've exhausted every page.
B000001Y42|4.0|back to the good old days before fred durst and limp bizkit put out total nonsense (\\"chocolate starfish\\") or taking long hiatuses (2000-2003), there was the \\"three dollar bill y'all\\". fred and his boys continued in the hardcore footsteps of rage and korn and incorporated rap lyrics into their music. however, they not only did it but also mastered this art. evidence of this would be the cukoo song \\"counterfeit\\", with fred shouting his rage to all the fake people, and \\"pollution\\", by far the best most raucous track on the album. the bizkit also do a tremendous cover of george michael's \\"faith\\" which makes for the big single. some other standouts are \\"stuck\\" and \\"stinkfinger which display limp bizkit's sound to the fullest. this album should not only be in the books but in your shelf, too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the best television show ever!  Fox should never have cancelled this great show.  Anyone who watches more than three episodes will be hooked for life.
0345409671|5.0|i've been reading some reviews for this book, and im appalled!!!!  this is one of my all time favorite books.  it deserves to be recognized for its utter magnificence.  I will be the first person to admit that Anne Rice is a little wordy, but in this book, im \\"A-Ok\\" w/ it.  Memnoch, Roger, Dora, & Lestat... *sigh* perfection.  the plot, setting, the revelations of evolution make you actually go \\"hmmm?\\" the ending, oh my god, no pun intended, but it was just superb!!!!  There aren't enough words in the english language to describe this book.  <BR>If you are open-minded and not some right-winger, bible thumper, you will LOVE this book. <BR>MEMNOCH THE DEVIL, i truly insist YOU reading this, if you love fiction, that makes you think, this is your book, baby!!!
B000063DFQ|5.0|Is how many people have described this album, and rightly so.<br />The first Maiden album I got was Best Of The Beast, which was given to me by my cousin, but I never really listened to it. My best friend Tommy, who listens to Maiden because his dad has them on vinyl, recommended Powerslave to me. Well, I couldn't find it anywhere, then I found someone with a copy of Piece Of Mind, and instantly knew that I would forever cherish it. I don't feel that I need to give each song their own review, since people before me have and done them justice.<br />BUY THIS<br />(and, of course, Powerslave, which will forever be immortal)
0064400557|5.0|This is an excellent book about friendships..friendships between two very different creatures--a pig and a spider.  Charlotte's Web was one of those books that I remember reading all the way through--I couldn't put it down--I had to keep reading to find out things.  Last year, my niece turned 10, and I decided to give her a copy of this wonderful story that I remember growing up with.
B000063DFN|5.0|Well, I don't know what to say. It's just so... so... so... good. I think this is one of those rare albums that you just get, then cherish, then listen to it so much that you may want to puke, but then you listen to it again with nothing better to do, then love it again. <br />1.Aces High-5/5-Very good song, reminiscent of Where Eagles Dare from Piece Of Mind. Awesome solo, too.<br />2.2 Minutes To Midnight-5/5-Can also be heard in GTA: Vice City on VROCK. One of Maiden's classics, and a song that many hold as one of their best songs. Great mellow part in the middle.<br />3.Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)-5/5-In my opinion, this is one of the best instrumentals ever. Many people cannot understand this simple thing; LOSFER WORDS= LOST FOR WORDS. Not difficult.<br />4.Flash Of The Blade-5/5-Part one of the 'two-part saga' in this album.<br />5.The Duellists-4/5-Part two of the 'saga', in my opinion it just doesn't live up to Flash Of The Blade.<br />6.Back In The Village-4/5-Not my favorite song on here, but it is not at all bad. Great lightning fast solo at the beginning, too.<br />7.Powerslave-5/5-It's just good.<br />8.Rime Of The Ancient Mariner-5/5-Very, very long epic. Will long be held as Maiden's (best) track.<br />Well, I know I probably haven't been much help, considering that if you're here, you have already heard this. But, I do what I can.
6301763041|5.0|I saw this movie shortly after it came out when I was in the fourth grade...My friends and I decided then and there to live the movie...It seriously changed my life.
B00005JKJA|4.0|There is really only one idea you need to get to watch this movie and understand what is going on. Dreams figure very large in the movie and many references to dreams and sleeping are made early in the movie to clue you in to the fact that much of the movie is a dream. <br />The &quot;plot&quot; is only revealed in the end, but plot is not the main focus of the movie. The movie focuses on the hopes, fears, and emotions of the dreamer as revealed through the narative of Betty and Rita, and other seemingly unrelated vignettes. They are all related. Pay attention to the end of the movie about who plays what role, and then imagine how you might dream such scenes if you just went through the experience of the dreamer's real life.<br />I gave 4 and not 5 stars because Lynch doesn't do a good enough job cluing the viewer in to the fact that everything is a dream. As I mentioned, dreams are emphasized early in the film, but there are many ways to use dreams in themes. It is too much of a leap to think the viewer will make the connection that the whole thing was a dream in time to understand the movie--or maybe it is just the transition from dream to awake that he mangles. When the dreamer wakes up, some of the characters change names--though I guess that can happen in dreams too. The cowboy clues the viewer into who is doing the dreaming just before the person awakes. From that moment, there is just not enough time to keep up with the sudden switch to the waking world. As soon as the dreamer awakes, the viewer is taken into a series of flashbacks explaining the context of the dream. If you don't get the dream thing(sadly it seems some go through the whole film and don't pick that up) the movie will make no sense. Other than Lynch's confusing of the audience, it is a very good movie, especially if you like movies driven by themes.
B00006690G|1.0|I love hip hop music, and that is all I listen to, but Eminem is not real hip hop. He's processed, commercialized garbage. All his beats sound the same, and his song writing is far from immaculate. He has a few good songs, but most of them are corny, syrup radio songs. Him and 50 Cent are both very, very average, at best.<br />If you want to listen to REAL hip hop, listen to the music of profound, REAL songwriters like Tupac Shakur ( rip ), Nas, the Wu Tang Clan, Talib Kweli, or Outkast....all of these artists are far superior songwriters and musicians than Eminem could ever hope to be.
6305428522|5.0|The answer to that question, is a resounding &quot;yes&quot;. The fact is that &quot;Quiz Show&quot; is, to my mind, one of the finest depictions of the television industry, 50's America, and morality (in a -somewhat- modern world) around. The stellar cast, led by Ralph Fiennes and Rob Morrow, turn in excellent performances - so much so that you wish each character could have more dialogue (the movie has a fairly substantial running time, but I have never felt it). The veritable Paul Scofield, a paragon of integrity, shines in his role as the patriarch and intellectual role model of the Van Doren family. The scenes between him and Fiennes are notable for how much is communicated without actually being said. Meanwhile, Rob Morrow (whose accent occasionally descends into farce) is excellent in his role as a tenacious investigator. <BR>     All in all, an excellent movie, and a testament to Redford's ability.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Wonderful album and best of the post Thick as a Brick releases!!!<BR>This album just has a magical sound.  Acoustic, flutes, great melodies, and a few rockers.  This surpaces Songs from the Woods and seems to me to be a more cohesive group of songs.  Songs feature great vocal melodies for Ian and the flute seems to roll along so smooth on all tunes.  It just has an old English, Prog folksy feel.<BR>The album starts off with The Mouse Police and is a strange but fantastic opener, leaves you not knowing what to expect. A highlight is No Lullaby and is a longer heavier track as well as Heavy Horses track which is a heavier piece as well and these two just shine on the guitar of Martin's. Rover is a rousing catchy, play it again song as well as One Brown Mouse, you hear it and have to play it again. In short, this is, without a doubt the best in the Tull catalog since Thick as A Brick.  This album contains a magical sound throughout and is consistently the best of the Tull albums(next to Brick that is)

B00005R1N3|5.0|I seen this movie on HBO when i was a kid in the 70's. i remembered it scared the hell out of me. To the point where i couldn't sleep for a few nights and for some time i didn't go into the attic without my trustee basball bat. ahh the innocents of childhood. lol. <br />i still like it and it still dose raise some hairs on my head. the phone calls added so much to this film. the murders were pretty decent. the killer is pretty cool. the voices he dose are pretty creepy. they didn't go gore crazy which is a plus when it comes to what i like about horror movies. this movie was made to give you the creeps and it did what it said it would do in the trailer.<br />if your into good scares? this ones for you! if your into total needles gore? then look elswhere. I gave this movie 4 stars for a few reasons. the director tries to scare you instead of trying to make you puke.<br />the only thing i didn't like about this movie is how the surviving woman handles herself. which is usually the same typical way all slasher stalker horror movie woman end up. not doing what they are susposed to do. but if they did? they wouldn't have a ending.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I would like to pre-empt this review by stating that I am a fan of most types of music across the spectrum.  Never have I heard an album so dynamic as this.  <br />Fortunately I was given this to listen to just prior to 12 hours of driving through farm land (the endless sameness of the scenery was the perfect backdrop of me to really listen to the whole batch of CD's).  This CD was so incredibly immersive that I listened to the entire album twice and only turned it off as I had hit civilization and couldn't focus on the music anymore.  <br />Definately the album of the year and I'm sure it will make more than a handful of &quot;all time top lists&quot;.  This could easily go toe to toe with ANY album my Yes, King Crimson or Rush.   Absolutely brilliant.
B0000011P7|5.0|The first time I put this CD in, I was honestly disappointed.  It's not Tull.  Even Under Wraps doesn't seem much more than a distant cousin to this recording.  Upon closer examination, I quickly added this album to my list of favorites.  Granted, it's not a collection of tunes for all occasions, but it's certainly a pleasant listen when one is receptive to a bit of adventurous music played by talented performers.<br />Highlight tracks include: End Game, Black &amp; White Television, and Different Germany.<br />If you want &quot;classic&quot; Tull, look elsewhere.  If you want the good Mr. Anderson to carry you along on a worthy and interesting musical experiment, you might just enjoy this one.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This CD is all I expected and much more!!!! 15 songs that will transport you into the movie, you'll feel like you are a pirate in the Black Pearl travelling around the seven seas... very exciting!! the best song is the credit's one, it makes me remember the movie and the characters... ahhh... captain jack sparrow, will turner and all the characters are totally represented in the soundtrack and if you liked at least one of the characters of the movie, then you will also like this CD!!!! enjoy it and drool with the jack's song!!!! so sweetie and lovely!!!! lov that bloody cutie pirate!!! yah maties!!!<BR>The movie is a must see and this soundtrack is definitely a must buy!!!
B000002KET|4.0|the album starts off with the title track which begins with one of tony iommi's greatist opening riffs,this song rocks ,a definite classic.a national acrobat sounds very strange but in a good way it's my favorite song on this cd,it also show's   off geezer butler's very unique song writing abilities.fluff is a really cool instrumental.sabbra cadabra is great rocker my second favorite track on this cd.killing yourself to live is another great track on this cd.the following three tracks are much more mellow than the others.who are you,looking for today and spiral arctitech  are good tracks but nothing special.as a whole this album is very good but it don't come close to sabbath 's classics like master of reality and volume 4.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Violent, unoriginal, prolonged, simplistic - not necessarily in any particular order. Manipulative from the start, our protagonist is shown as a young child witnessing his father's violent death in a gang confrontation. Without explanation, the movie tells us to accept that the father was such a hero that his enemy, our antagonist, worships him years beyond death. Rote recital of period gang names and slang words tries to establish historical credibility. The plot unfolds predictably as our protagonist returns to avenge his father's death. Daniel Day Lewis does Snidely Whiplash, Leonardo DiCaprio looks for Kate Winslet, and there's just not Something About Cameron. It's hard to believe that life was so awful or everyone would be dead through gang violence or their own hand. It's hard to see what is going on with Where's Waldo style scenery viewed through lenses laden with dust from the last century. And there are definitely better Irish tunes. Wasteful, void, offensive - there are some more adjectives.
B000002B7M|4.0|ozzy's first solo album is a great album.not his best solo effort ,that one goes to bark at the moon.every song on this album is great except for the last two tracks revelation{mother earth} and steal away the night.highlights on this album are the classic crazy train,the highly underrated classic i don't know and mr.crowley.a pretty good album that no fan of ozzy should be without.
B00008NRLX|5.0|I was driving in my car last week when I heard the single &quot;Save it for a Rainy Day.&quot; It was the first time I had heard the song. It was, and is, spectacular. I ended up waiting through the next few songs on the radio, to find out from the DJ who the heck this band was that I had obviously been missing. Needless to say, I immediately purchased the CD and have fallen in love with the Jayhawks. This album strikes a much-needed cathartic chord in the hungry heart of an oftentimes shallow music biz. I've already listened to it all the way through 5 times. Amazing stuff...
B000002KE2|5.0|this is proberly sabbath's most diverse album.everysong on this album is a definite winner excluding the short instrumental track f.x.from the beautiful ballat changes{the best ballat ever performed},the great instrumental laguna sunrise,the classic snowblind,my personal favorite and highly underrated under the sun,the very intersting sounding cornucopia and another sabbath classic tomorrow's dream.my favorite tracks are under the sun and wheels of confusion{bill ward's drumming on this track is out of this world}i can not put into words how great this album really is.if you don't have this cd in your own personal collection ,then you are really missing out on some great music.take my word on it ,get this album no matter how much it costs.you won't be dissapointed
B00005JM1Y|3.0|I am a big fan of Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean).  I have seen his TV sitcom and his stand-up comedy shows.  I hate to say that this movie fell below my expectation gauging from his past movies/shows.  There are a some hilarious moments at times, but some of the comic scenes were predictable.  Mr. Atkinson's movie usually start with him being a silly and childish character which would got him into some sticky situations.  But he always ended the movie by solving the problem with his unique, smart, creative, and hilarious way; in other word the Rowan Atkinson's way.  That is one component that I feel was missing from the ending of Johnny English.
B000002B7S|5.0|the first three ozzy cd's blizzard of oz,diary of a madman and bark at the moon are by far he's best solo albums.after bark at the moon the rest of his albums were starting to go downhill.bark at the moon is even better than any of his black sabbath recordings except for volume 4.every song on this album can be considered a classic.bark at the moon,so tired,now you see it now you don't and my personal favorite your no different are all hard rock/metal gems.the rest of the songs are also great.this is a must have in your own cd collection.
B00005QDW1|1.0|this album is so awful!  it is very very horrible. i only really like 2 songs, 'Underneath It All', and 'Running' ... I like No Doubt's first album.  I really really love 'The Beacon Street Collection'.  'Tradgic Kingdom' is a mid 90's classic and I love it.  'Return of Saturn' is the greatest NO Doubt album ever. It is amazing. No Doubt rules, but 'Rock Steady' is just terrible. hardcore no doubt fans like it because they will like anything that is no doubt.  other than  that this music is good for little teenage girls. not for real music lovers ... buy any other no doubt album besides this.
0790744295|4.0|&quot;Creepshow&quot; is especially fun for me, because I work in a job where I feel underappreciated. Every bad person in this film gets his/her due; though there are some bad people left over, they'll be fine. A bunch of great stories, penned by King and directed by Romero, you can't help but have fun. Aside from the knowledge that this is comic book stuff, an element of humor pervades all of the action. I won't blab away any of the plots, but... The E.G. Marshall scene was best, but the (very serious) Leslie Neilsen scene was fun, too. Actually, Adrienne Barbeau &amp; Hal Holbrook seemed to have the most fun. Also, Viveca Lindfors let herself look ugly, and, though she's advancing in years, she's has lovely class (she was the English teacher in &quot;The Sure Thing&quot;, two years later). There's so much to say about this film, and, apparently, the critics wrote it off. Who cares?! This is loads of fun.
6303921248|5.0|Okay, okay.  So Austen purists will point out that the mini-series was not, in fact, exactly like the book.  But in all major respects, these videos follow the Jane Austen book wonderfully - making this miniseries the best dramatization of any book that I've seen.  The casting was also wonderful - I can't imagine anyone else but Colin Firth making a convincing Darcy, with all that character's layers.<br />This is a series that I pull out when it's nasty outside, and watch with a nice cup of tea.  It's also wonderful sick-day entertainment.  But more than that, it's a brilliant example of how classic literature should be handled by the entertainment industry.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is definitely the one of the best albums i have ever had.  Christina is a new person in this cd and all for the better.  She left behind her pop image and is now something entirely better.  All her songs have real meaning and each of them help me in my life.  My favorite songs are Cruz- I love the theme of this song. Just to get away! Walk away- I need this song!<BR>and my very favorite has to be Can't hold us down!  Christina is not the trash I used to think she was
B00005YXZH|5.0|ok, most everybody likes this.  In response to the reviews that derisively say that Wilco is trying to be art-y:  If they are, they succeeding at it. This album is more than just some background music to listen to while you're at work or studying.  It is music that is actually both demanding and rewarding.  Some of the bad reviews sound like they are from people who would've declared Almost Blue terrible because the harmonies aren't cheery or Billie Holiday boring because she just can't find the beat.
B00005ARDC|4.0|B.R.M.C. is kind of a specialised taste, but it's some d*mn fine music. I first heard about them through Noel Gallagher and David Grohl, who both think they are awesome, if those two names mean anything to you. The band is currently working on the next album, but if you see their self-titled debut at Sam Goody and have the cash, buy it, because it is relatively hard to find and well worth the money.<br />BRMC glides along at a steady pace throughout the entire disc, while the music varied from song (rock, punk, blues bass) and themes (love, and a lot of Jesus theories), the album sticks together extremely well and is hard not to listen to the entire album rather than skipping tracks or leaving halfway through. The songs stick with you when you do leave, not so much to annoy, but to make you want to comeback and listen again. The vocals take on a soft Beatlesque drawl in some places and early 80's punk at other times, at once soothing and sacrilegious. As beautiful and well-crafted the songs are, the texture is rough and unpolished for a studio album, but that much only makes the grittier sound more raw and heartfelt, rather than the distanced and digitized junk you hear on the radio. You can actually feel and see the band playing rather than some computer.<br />&quot;Love Burns&quot; is the only US single I know of, but is easily matched or topped in its own special way by any other song on the album.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is one of the most amazing and intriguing films that I've ever seen. It keeps your attention without skipping a beat and concludes most fabulously, with mathemetician John Nash played brilliantly by Russell Crowe. The story will keep you thinking for days, and you will see the world in a different light.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Look its icp..... oh nevermind its just another bunch of wanna be hardcore screaming korn kids. This cd makes me wanna cry for the wrong reasons. You hear it and you think things along the lines of \\"Do they actually think they're good...... this is joke right?\\"
0316776963|4.0|This is the first David Sedaris book I've read, and now I plan to read them all! There were a few stories that made me laugh out loud like &quot;You Can't Kil te Rooster&quot; and &quot;A Shiner Like a Diamond&quot;.  The other stories were very entertaining and witty. It's an excellent light read, and I highly recommend it!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've heard Christina's songs since she first came out, but never LISTENED to them. But now I'm listening.  And what I hear and see is a 22-year-old woman who is coming out in full force. Christina's CD Stripped is AMAZING.  Not only are her songs fun, they are real.  They speak the truth.  Christina sings what I've been wanting hear! I'm listening to the CD right now as I type this review!  I loved this CD so much that, I just bought one of Christina's previous CD's.  I wish I'd noticed her l-o-n-g before now, because I have a LOT of catching up to do.  CD's to buy, shirts to purchase, and posters to tape on my wall ;)  and not to mention DVD's to buy and concerts to attend!  Buy this CD, I love EVERY song on this CD!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This short-lived but well written television series comes to DVD just months after being cancelled by the shortsighted FOX network. If FOX had not bungled the marketing campaign for this show so terribly, many more people might have come to the conclusion that this was the best show on television for a while there. Only a half-season was made, including a second pilot episode (FOX didn't like the first, despite the fact that it was excellent), but there isn't a bad episode in the bunch, including the three unaired episodes (not to mention the gag reel) that have found popularity on the internet. The show garnered an Emmy nom for Outstanding Visual Effects. Word has it that a feature film may be in the works, so there may be life for Firefly after network television. As for the details regarding this yet unreleased DVD set, here's the skinny from series creator Joss Whedon:<br />Oh my god. They couldn't be specialer. We've got three unaired episodes, commentary by every cast member, big interviews with everybody, gag reel  all kinds of stuff. It's just bells and whistles, and they'll be in the right order. And widescreen. So it really couldn't be better DVD package... a wicked one, at that. They really went to town on it. I was like, \\"I don't know if they'll release them on DVD, because it was cancelled,\\" and they're not only releasing it, they're doing everything. I did the commentary on the two-hour pilot with Nathan. He and Alan did one together... Alan Tudyk. It's really exciting.<BR> Shiny!
B0000A1RJI|2.0|Although the music truly encompassed the movie, it doesn't sit well as a stand-alone soundtrack.  The whole disc sounds as though it was pieced together quickly, as though the producers were afraid to invest money into the soundtrack in case the movie failed.  Typically soundtracks are released before or the week of a movie release, correct?  I feel that the best soundtracks are designed to follow the progress of the movie it is from (i.e. &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;), but &quot;Pirates&quot; I am not so sure.  I give credit to Klaus Badelt, but having Hans Zimmer involved (&quot;Overproduced&quot;??) made it sound like almost everything else Zimmer has done.  Heard &quot;The Rock,&quot; &quot;Gladiator,&quot; or &quot;Crimson Tide?&quot;  Then you've already heard &quot;Pirates&quot; but with different notes.  The solo cello work is excellent, but when the action picks up, like Zimmer scores, everything goes from soft strings to extremely loud with bombastic horns.  Everytime the music got loud in the theater, I kept waiting for Maximus to ride in with his Roman cavalry and wipe out any pirates nearby.  The dynamics are there, but not the originality.  I truly wonder what part of this score was Badelt's, or was it &quot;overproduced&quot; by Zimmer.  It is a shame though, great movie, I was looking forward to a fantastic score.  Go spend your money on Howard Shore, John Williams, or Basil Poledouris; you'll get more enjoyment from it.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is no different than most Stones albums. It's got classics and it's got good songs and not so good songs. Of course it's a double album,so it's got twice as many... I give it five stars<BR>just for the two opening numbers. Everything else is just gravy.<BR>I like Sticky Fingers better. Not a clunker in the bunch.
B00005JLU1|5.0|This movie is excellent. I think its very entertaining and fun to watch. It will keep you on your toes with all of the action between the drapes and the squares. This needs to come out to dvd. I think it will be a very good seller.<BR>Please bring this to dvd.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|i may sound like a dork but the cher concert was one of the funnest nights of my life.  you have to understand that i am from lubbock, tx one of the most backward cities in the us.  for cher to grace this city with her presence is like a gift form god.  the concert was the best concert i have ever seen.  she truly defines what an entertainer is and should be.  the woman is a legend and still looks so good for her age.  her songs are classic and to see her perform them live is such a thrill.  i think i will buy this dvd when it comes out because i recorded the one off of nbc but i want it commercial free and with nothing bleeped out.  for a real concert experience i think everyone should get this dvd also, there is no way possible anyone would come off disappointed.  cher is a true diva, a living legend, and the definition of an entertainer.  having said that catch her last performance before she disappears.
0066620996|5.0|This book is better than the competition (which is what the book is about!), so it gets a little boost to keep it in the five-star rating. Generally a very good book, easy to read and comprehend, laid out well, with good documentation.<br />One thing that bothered me was the (large) number of graphs of stock prices. Part of what bothered me was the number -- I get the point, already. Another part that bothered me was that the stock valuation does not always reflect well on the company, although this often is the case, especially during the time frame right before the book was released. However, my biggest gripe is that the prices were shown in a linear fashion rather than logarithmic. Most people will say &quot;so what&quot; because they are used to seeing linear prices. However, it hides experiences at other prices. For example, a 4x ramp-up at the end will look much more significant than a 20x ramp-up earlier. There is room for some argument about the two, but a logarithmic chart would have been much better.<br />There is some great advice, er, research results. Just reading the summaries at the end of each chapter will enlighten the reader.<br />One of the good things mentioned is that the company should worry less about &quot;motivating&quot; employees and worry more about &quot;NOT DE-motivating&quot; them. This follows well with my experience and the experiences of most good leaders that I know. An analogy of mine is the 100-yard dash. Most people who watch such a race will think that the winner really pulled ahead at the end. However, in reality, it was that the winner maintained the fast pace and the others fell behind. This is the same perspective that this book gives -- the conventional wisdom is often close enough to feel comfortable, but further analysis shows that conventional wisdom needs to be adjusted. This book is good at doing just that.
B00005RZV4|5.0|this cd is awesome. the sound  quality is great, and trent and the band  sound as good as ever. all the songs were good choices and kicking it off with terrible lie was perfect. key songs are terrible lie, wish, closer, starf***ers inc, and hurt. if you are a nin fan then this review doesnt mean a thing because you obviously allready have it, right? and if not then go out NOW and buy it.
B000092Q7O|5.0|Like Dracula, World War II is probably one of the most filmed eras. You have Oskar Schindler's saving the Jews in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, and the Invasion of Normandy in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Here, Roman Polanski directs a story that takes place throughout World War II through the eyes of a Polish man and his love for the piano. <br />The story begins as Wladyslaw Spilzman, a pianist is living through augmenting worse conditions. He then is forced to hide through the ruins of Warsaw, until his rescue from the ruins by a kind hearted German officer. Through dealing with famine, tragedy and death, he manages to get through it by his wanting to play the piano, even in his mind. In one scene, he imagines playing the piano notes in his head without actually playing for fear of Germans overhearing.<br />In today's era of overblown movies without substance like Legally Blonde or really expensive but good films like Matrix Reloaded, it's about time a film came out of Hollywood with a gripping story and human characters, rather than a big green Shrek reject.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio does a passable job Amsterdam Vallon, who watches his father get killed in a fight over possession of the Five Points with Bill the Butcher. He comes back later and swears to get revenge. Ironically, when Amsterdam meets Bill, Bill takes him under his wing and can't go anywhere without him. But Daniel Day Lewis steals the show. He is amazing as Bill the Butcher, the leader of the Natives who is at times a little psychotic. He is merciless to his enemies and is suspicious of everyone. Cameron Diaz plays a small part as an irish immigrant that survives by her pickpocketing skills. She is better than DiCaprio but no one in this film is better than Lewis. <BR>The only thing that saves this overly gory and violent film the the shocking realization of how hard life was in New York during the Civil War and Scorsese's incredible shots and amazingly realistic sets. Of course you could do without about 20 minutes of the film but Lewis's portrayal of Bill the Butcher and Scorsese's amazing shots more than make up for it.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is a great soundtrack to accompany the best movie of the summer.  It has a great presence with it and i recommed it to anyone who loved the movie
B000093FLA|5.0|Snatch is one of the best DVD's I have and a true Must Have DVD for a Movie buff or guy movie junkie.Snatch's story is one of the best I've seen in years,It gets a little confusing but pays for itself in the end. <br /> The best characters in the film are Mickey,Tyrone,Turkish,and Turkish's partner Tommy. But the character that steals the show is the Dog (you'll see him a lot).<br /> The Boxing scenes are some of the best I've ever seen and are some of the best ever on film.These are great and suspenseful and funny in some parts.<br /> Also you may want to watch the DVD with the subtitles on to understand what the Pikeys are saying especially Brad Pitt's character Mickey.<br /> Some of the best scenes have to do with the Pikeys. Watch closely because they are hard to understand.
B000007SPT|5.0|Great CD! I bought it after hearing a few moments of &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; in the movie trailer for (of all things!!) Michael Bay's re-make of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. If you (like me) were grabbed by this sample when seeing the preview for this movie, by all means- buy it today!
0440237688|5.0|STORY: As one of the editorial reviews so nicely put: &#34;In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his Utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of Brave New World, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.&#34;<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK<br />1) SETTING - The story takes place in a made-up utopian community that seems to exist in Earth's future at some point. The setting really is a huge part in understanding how this community has isolated itself through choices, in order to have the &#34;utopian&#34; society they have. It was very interesting and could be imagined thanks the the author's descriptions.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS - The character's play the parts they are assigned like the people in the community take the job they are assigned by the community leaders. There are no questions or variance from these roles because that is all the character knows. The character of Jonas is the one that breaks this mold and is the focus of the story. As he learns what his society is missing he grows as a character to be liked even though he isn't following the standards of practice that his peers are. His character becomes increasingly gripping especially in the last twenty or so pages of the book when he starts to act on his new found knowledge in response to the contradictions he has been brought up with all twelve years of his life.<br /><br />3) STORY - At first I was reading this as the authors viewpoint of what a Utopian society &#34;should&#34; be: Euthanasia, abortion, clothing is a bother, be in touch with your personal self, pills to control sexual desires, controlled and numbered births and marriages each year, etc. Then I came to realize that the society the author creates is not necessary her viewpoint but simply the concept created by the architects of that particular community. Each community is a bit different depending on who configured them. But all in all, in order to live in a place without poverty, starvation and crime there are some major things each and every community gives up. This is the crux of the story and what really drives the climax and conclusion.<br /><br />OVERALL - I picked this book up because I heard that a famous scriptwriter was contracted to do the screenplay for this book. It is an easy read and less than 200 pages. The story leaves you thinking about it hours later. I could not read the last ten pages fast enough!! The story just built up to this phenomenal climax and conclusion that had me ripping through the book to the next page because I had to find out what happens. I got this book at the library and now I have to own it so I can read it at least five more times.a, abortion, clothing is a bother, be in touch with your personal self, pills to control sexual desires, controlled and numbered births and marriages each year, etc. Then I came to realize that the society the author creates is not necessary her viewpoint but simply the concept created by the architects of that particular community.

0385486804|1.0|Anyone who likes this book has not read it. Krakauer spends more time whining about his troubled relationship with his own father, and complaining that Jack London was an overweight city slicker, than he does addressing the story of a young man who was extremely interesting.  If you have seen the episode of Millenium about this, or saw it on 48 Hours, you will have gained more insight than Krakauer's incessant whining. To put it into perspective, when I saw the book, my wife (who had read the book) said I would be very disappointed.  I was more than disappointed.  The book is a complete waste of time to anyone but Krakauer's overtaxed therapist.
B000001C6M|4.0|1983, in my opinion, was one of metal's best years. \\"Kill 'Em All\\", \\"Piece of Mind\\", and \\"Show No Mercy\\" were 3 of countless great metal albums that came out that year. I listen to all of Slayer's albums today and realize that Slayer could not have had more melody in their songs than on \\"The Antichrist\\", \\"Tormentor\\", and \\"Face the Slayer\\". On most of their other songs on other albums it's mostly just spooky, kind of Castlevania riffs. On \\"Show No Mercy\\", Slayer is mostly just following the classic 80's heavy metal formula. A great introduction to one of the greatest speed metal bands ever.
B00005OM4N|3.0|The first thing I'd like to say is that I am shocked from the immaturiaty of the reviewers here. Don't you see the warning that if you're under 13 years of age, do NOT sumbit the review here? What exactly are you judging? NONE of you sound objective. Well, not none but 90% of you. This album shouldn't get 5 stars, as it shouldn't get 1 star. Let's remember one good thing about this album, OK? Britney is the first pop star out there now to start maturing on an album. What exactly mature music is for YOU? Boring ballads/Rock Songs? Let's just say there are 6 worthy songs on the album that are very good. I'm A Slave 4 U, Overprotected, Not A Girl, Boys, Lonely and What It's Like To Be Me. There are 2 bonus tracks for this album, you better get that edition. Those 2 tracks could easily become hits, they're called &quot;Before The Goodbye&quot; and &quot;I Run Away&quot; - both BT's masterpieces. The vocals on the album? Well, if you take some songs out, the vocals here are all computerized and &quot;fixed&quot;. Britney's real voice sounds alot more stronger, the exact opposite of what some of you said. Don't you hear it's computerized? God. You can hear Britney's best vocals on her first 2 albums, though BOMT really shows alot more.<br />So I'm giving this album the respect it deserves and am hoping for a very different album the next time, and I don't think I'll be disappointed as she's going on Madonna's &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; way but also mixing lots of tunes. From the bit I heard on the TRL preview, it sounds promising. Also - she didn't work with Max Martin on the 4th LP so it should be different, no pop producers. Good or not? we'll see. I am not over with Britney Spears, she should prove herself just as Madonna had.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can already tell you that this DVD set will be awesome.  The show was excellent, and did NOT deserve to be cancelled.  In just 12 aired hours (with three unaired episodes added to this DVD set for a total of 15), the show managed to have more character development and create a more distinct atmosphere than any other show it's been my privilege to enjoy.<br />Thanks, Joss, for a wonderful maiden voyage!  Here's hoping for that feature film!
6304057709|5.0|Some people have comfort food to help them through dull, drizzly evenings. I have comfort films, and Ang Lee's, (and Emma Thompson's), \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is one of my favorites. I have watched this movie several times since I first saw it, and it never fails to lift my spirits.<br />This glorious romance of mores and manners, set during England's Regency Period, is very faithful to Jane Austen's brilliant novel. The film vividly brings the novel, with all its characters, to life. The plot focuses on two of the three Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, and their extremely different temperaments. Emma Thompson wrote this wonderful screenplay and earned an Academy Award for her efforts. She added pizzazz to the film, with an extra dash of drama, some humor, splendid panoramic views and a fabulous ball scene.<br />A lovely, young Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood to perfection. Marianne is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance as Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters. She has a more practical, sensible temperament. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Ms. Thompson gives Elinor a wicked, dry sense of humor, and her character adds much wit to the dialogue. Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.<br />The movie opens dramatically, with Mr. Dashwood, the girls' father, on his deathbed, begging his son and heir, (by his first marriage), to please take care of his wife and three daughters after he dies. The spineless John Dashwood sincerely promises his father to do so, and then is persuaded not to by his greedy wife, Fanny, in a wonderful satire-filled scene. Before Elinor, Marianne, their adorable younger sister Margaret, and their mother are forced to leave their home, the Norwood estate, they meet Fanny's brother, the shy and kind Edward Ferrars, (Hugh Grant). Over a period of a few weeks, while the women are packing their belongings, Elinor and Edward grow obviously fond of each other. Their attachment is interrupted by Fanny, who senses the bond forming between her sister-in-law and her brother, and urges the four Dashwood women to leave immediately for their new home.<br />Upon arriving at their new residence, Barton Cottage, near the estate of Mrs. Dashwood's cousin John, the women meet their relatives and some new neighbors. Colonel Brandon, played by the charismatic Alan Rickman, is included in the welcome party. Brandon is drawn at once to the beautiful, musical Marianne, who does not reciprocate his affection. Instead she falls madly in love with the dashing Willoughby, and Greg Wise is extremely dashing in his persuasive performance as the reckless, feckless young suitor.<br />The family settles in and explores their surroundings. Elinor waits in vain for Edward to visit her at Barton Cottage. Willoughby's expected marriage proposal to Marianne is unexpectedly interrupted. Two unhappy sisters travel to London for the season, hoping to settle their romantic affairs, and instead, find their dreams thwarted.<br />I won't give the story away, but it is a tale told wonderfully well, dramatized to perfection by extraordinary actors, and directed by the incomparable Ang Lee. Too many superlatives? You won't think so after you have seen \\"Sense And Sensibility.\\"s dramatically, with Mr. Dashwood, the girls' father, on his deathbed, begging his son and heir, (by his first marriage), to please take care of his wife and three daughters after he dies.

0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones (LB)\\" has been touted as THE debut novel of the year. Richly praised by book critics, the public has embraced it unreservedly by buying large quantities of it to ensure that it stays high in the bestsellers list. What's so special about it ? I've read it, yet I can't say I know the answer.<br />Perhaps it is down to Sebold's comforting feel-good message of hope to us mortals that when our loved ones die or leave us unexpectedly, they don't disappear forever from our lives but hover above to protect the living like guardian angels. But Sebold doesn't stop there. According to her, the spirits in Heaven hanker to return to planet Earth to experience what's unfinished in their lives and it's that yearning that connects the living with the dead.<br />Sebold takes a horrid subject and turns it into magic, the kind that is seductive and all too willingly embraced by readers. Suzie must be the most cheerful victim of rape and murder in the history of fiction. She's not bitter because she continues to live in the hearts of her family and friends and vice versa. It doesn't hurt that Sebold has lined up a luminous cast of characters to enthral us with. Suzie's father is the big-hearted loving father that anyone could ever wish for. Her mother, more distant and frigid emotionally, hurts more, so goes AWOL in search of herself. Brainy sister Lindsey and cuddly brother Buckley make up the nuclear family, to which is added the charmingly eccentric Grandma Lynn. Ex, coloured boyfriend Ray, oddball girlfriend Ruth, policeman Len, Ruana Singh (Ray's mother) and  Mr Harvey, Suzie's creepy murderer complete the novel's colourful cast. <br />In keeping with its feel-good orientation, LB isn't about exposing the killer and bringing him to justice, so readers needn't fret or feel disappointed that Mr Harvey isn't finally apprehended, handcuffed and marched into prison. Sebold entrusts this to the icy hand of Nature. Instead, Suzie \\"returns\\" to take care ofsome unfinished business of her own, thereby learning to let go. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is an enchanting story, one that will warm the cockles of your heart. <br />Yet I found LB oddly unexceptional. Despite its delightful take on death and the afterlife and some fine characterisation, Sebold's prose is deliberate and forced and frustratingly less than smooth. Her constant references to all-American objects and symbols is also unnecessarily reductive and deeply annoying, which is a great pity. I enjoyed LB well enough, but it's no great shakes.  I don't think it'll find its way anytime soon into the portals of Enduring Literature.
B00008PC2O|5.0|James Cameron's Sequel to his original ground breaking science fiction epic is not only a ground breaking achievement in special effects but is a compelling look at the danger of greed and the abuse of technology. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator and is a good guy this time around protecting a young John Connor from a more advance-killing machine named the T-1000 played with deadly precession by Robert Patrick. Linda Hamilton returns as Sara Connor, and has been preparing her son for the future war to come. Her performance is a great continuation of the character she played in the first movie, and she has been through the ringer for her knowledge of what's to come.  The special effects are ground breaking, and they do hold up well over time, maybe because they were done with a sense class, and not overly done like the movies we have coming out now.  It's rare that a sequel could be better than the original in every way, but this is a prime example of that fact.  <br />A true science fiction classic.
6304508611|5.0|This has been my all time favorte horror movie for years and it still is. I have seen it countless times and it never gets old. I also think its one of the best Stephen King movies besides Dolores Claiborne, Shawshank Redemption, and Stand By Me.<BR>Its about a tormented young woman(played brilliantly by Spacek) who is constantly made fun of at school by her peers and terrorized at home by her religious fanatic mother(Piper Laurie does the job so good i was so glad she wasnt my mother!). Carrie has telekenesis which means she can move objects with her mind. SO when she gets invited to the senior prom and someone plays a cruel prank well lets just say Carrie gets even! Like another reviewer im sure i can quote this movie word from word. Everything about this movie is excellant. The acting, the direction, the beautiful score by pino donaggio. Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles BEtty Buckley all turn in great performances too. This is the best horror movie and others have tried copying its shock sequence over the years and cannot come close! And i cannot believe a reviewer saying they preferred the garbage called The RAge CArrie 2 over this? Were you watching the same movie. that one was laughable. i was laughing at the flying Cds.<BR>If you have not seen this brillaint piece of filmaking see it. And Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie should have won their Oscars!
B00005JLZN|5.0|This is a good mystery/thriller/detective movie that makes you always guessing and wondering. Don't get caught in the &quot;death penalty&quot; situation, since you may or may not agree with it. Instead, pay attention to the story, ie. what Kate Winslet found, what Kevin Spacey did, how his reaction was, etc. If you do that, you'll find yourself a great whodunit movie.
