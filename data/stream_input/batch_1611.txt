B004I744AS|5.0|great informative app!  it has more than dictionary.  it has horoscope, word games, interesting facts, weather, and a few other useful things to keep anyone thoroughly entertained.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This was not at all what I expected, with all the hype about this book-thought I'd give it a read, although I must say I had to force my self to finish the last 1/3 of the book.  Sad story, all the way around-knowing full well there would be no happy ending for either of the main characters, really sad.<br />The world is sad enough, not my idea of a good read.
1439102732|1.0|Picoult's latest is an anti-Christian rant delivered by a heroine who lives as a heterosexual for 40 years before discovering out of the blue...she's gay, which might lead one to believe that she's not the sharpest tool in the shed in the first place. There's a lot going on in this novel, which gives no clue on the jacket that rather than the ridiculous sex scenes between heterosexuals one has to put up with in a lot of women's fiction, one will be treated instead to blow by blow lesbian encounters, which of course, are superior to man/woman sex hands down. There's a lot of preachy rhetoric about freedom and gay rights and what constitutes family, but don't be fooled by this.  The bottom line in this book is that all Christians are terminally stupid blockheads led by hypocritical, pernicious criminals, who maltreat their wives and children, utilize blackmail, suborn perjury and chew the scenery of every page of this book they inhabit.  The author only just restrained herself from naming any of them \\"Snidely Whiplash\\" so we would get it that they are bad, very, very bad...and don't forget, stupid...The whole book was an ordeal capped by the cringe worthy, sometimes laughably smarmy and badly sung music included. Given the caliber of other Picoult novels, it makes one wonder if some militant Gay fringe group didn't kidnap her and substitute this propaganda while she was tied up in closet somewhere...
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|To me, Beautiful Disaster started off so amazing yet the ending turned my excitement into an \\"ehh\\". Let me explain...<br /><br />We start the book off at an underground fighting ring where Abby watches Travis Maddox kick the crap out of another guy. Travis is the hot, brooding bad boy who has slept his way around campus. They start an unlikely friendship. The first half of the book was Travis and Abby realizing how much they wanted each other. I thought the relationship was adorable and for Abby to crawl her way into Travis's damaged heart was delightful, and at some point I had referred to this book as crack (not that I've ever tried crack...). I sped my way through it until it got a bit...\\"ehhh\\"<br /><br />So, yes, Travis is damaged, we get that. He is insecure and has a hot (hot) temper, and oh yeah, he is wicked jealous of anyone even looking at Abby. I had no issue with a guy with issues but what happened next bewildered me.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into extreme detail about the book because I don't want to ruin it for the rest of the world who hasn't read it, but just a few tidbit really turned me off. Tattoos? WHAT? And the apparent obsession that the campus had with Travis and Abby was so unrealistic. If this was a high school setting I would get it...but it's a college campus. That was just unbelievable for me.<br /><br />So that was the last half of the book and I was tempted to close it and just end it there. But I finished it for the sake of reviewing it and where it started as one of my favorites, by the end I had completely written it off.<br /><br />Overall, McGuire is a great storyteller who can write a heck of a romance with many ups and downs making you cheer for a relationship to work out. But the rest of the story fell short for me. This is only one opinion so I suggest if you are into reading upper YA contemporaries you should check this one out and see if you would enjoy it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Great puzzles to choose from and good difficulty but it keeps crashing.  All of a sudden I'm in the middle of a game and the app will have to unexpectedly have to close.  Very annoying!
B0088X7YU0|5.0|This CGI movie was very good... SO~ much better then I had thought it was going to be<br />the CGI work is pretty good, maybe not as good as other movies, yes.<br />But still did a really good job with it and if you are a fan of Science fiction Video games and movies<br />you WILL see a lot of them in this movie. from what I saw it has.<br />Halo<br />Gears of War<br />KillZone<br />Mass Effect<br />Dead Space<br />Alien<br />Lost Planet<br /><br />And if you don't and/or didn't see them, I don't know how you would miss them?<br />But Starship Troopers: Invasion was one of the BEST Starship Troopers movies to come out since the first one and I hoping to see another one done CGI.
B001RLP862|4.0|I bought a deck of these with no expectations and found them to be nice cards of good quality.<br /><br />I never used them at poker night with the guys because other plastic decks were not well received, but they are great for playing with my young daughter.<br /><br />A single drink knocked over on the table is enough to ruin most decks of cards, but these clean up easily.  They also work well with the hands free card holders, which my daughter still uses.<br /><br />A good product overall, but I can't envision needing to buy another deck because these will probably not wear out.
B0086700CM|3.0|its all right not the worst but not my top 10 app.I like its ghraphic designing. but it is boring doing running the same routes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I thought you would be able to play all 100 and some games but you have to unlock them by winning other games and I just don't like that.
B007LB2B3K|2.0|I love Volbeat 1st of all, and this album does kill it on many levels.<br />5 stars for the album, but 2 stars for the HORRIBLE quality of this download.<br />Just about the worst sounding download Ive ever heard. Amazon doesnt have the cleanest sounding downloads to begin with(I hope they will change that), but this one is just terrible. I just wasted $8 on something I can not even listen to...its THAT bad. Save your cash and buy it on cd, or an mp3 elsewhere. Its straight MUDDY! And Its being played on good equipment too. Polk and Morel speakers in the car, and Sennheiser on the computer. I hate wasting money! Thanks for nothing Amazon!
B003O86FMW|3.0|The title of this review says it all. This series has gotten a lot of hype, but the end leaves much to be desire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this game cuz it makes me think but isn't overly difficult. It doesn't take too long to complete games, so it is good for short breaks.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like the game alot. I like all the different dragon levels. I would recommend this game to others.
0312576463|5.0|I liked this book even more than The Corrections.  Frazen fairly represented every character.  This isn't a dysfunctional family but a seemingly normal family with passions and heartbreak.  Book opens with other neighbors' impressions of the Berglunds.  The Berglunds are a young couple with two children, who move away after almost eighteen years to Washington, and then a few years later, there is a nasty write up about Walter Berglund in the NYT.  Walter is a middle child, hardworking, good; his passion is conservation, mainly by trying to rally people not to reproduce.  Walter's best friend is Richard Katz, who is a musician.  Richard Katz cannot handle fame, and he is titillated by Patty, Walter's wife.  Patty is titillated in return.  Patty comes from a very liberal family - her mother is a politician, her father is lawyer, and Patty is the outcast amongst her so-called artistic siblings.  Patty's favorite child, Joey, turns against her - or rather, Patty turns against him, and later, she finds a new friendship in the overly independent daughter, Jessica.  Every character is intriguing, and I was aghast at the amorality of those running the country.  A very good, wonderful read.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Does what is promised. Works flawlessly. A bit tricky using a small mobile phone though. Excellent when using a tablet. It transfers your computer to your ipad, Kindle Fire or Samsung or whatever. Download NOW!<br />You wont be disappointed!!!
030758836X|5.0|I wasnt sure what to expect from this book as I had never read any of her novels before. Being a crime/murder mystery buff I couldnt put it down! The ending seemed a little contrived, but overall I loved the book and will be reading more of her novels soon!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|This album is fantastic! Well worth taking a chance if you aren't very familiar with the band. Even though this band (and album) will be labeled as \\"indie\\", their music is more than friendly to the masses, not just the indie crowd.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I feel this is good  entertainment reading. The author kept me very interested and I purchased the second book right away because I didnt care for the ending.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie is great. It follows the book pretty well and appropriately depicts the action of the book. Ultra Violeton on the other hand is the method of obtaining a digital copy out the movie. I would much rather have a digital copy disc that I could use to put on any device as opposed to only devices that run Ultra Violet
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a great game. My husband and kids were playing it a while before me. They got me on and I'm hooked. Plus I have bragging rights for longest travel. It is easy and hard at the same time. Easy to understand but some missions can be quite hard. My middle kid really just likes flying and spending the coins earned in the game. My oldest and I enjoy the missions.  I will say my sons and I ran through the mission levels pretty quickly but the seem to have started over but some got harder with higher expectations. I would recommend this game for everyone.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|If you are a Designer or Artist, this is hands down the best stylus you will ever use! It feels perfect when you grip it, and is easy to use in all graphics apps. It gives you a great amount of control, the tip is the perfect size.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|When I first finished Patrick Rothfuss' Name Of The Wind two years ago I was a bit sad. I knew that even though the book was wonderful (and had a sequel on the horizon), that great books which capture me as that one did don't come along very often. Before Rothfuss was Harry Potter, and that was a good number of years before Rothfuss. It was five years before Potter that Pillars Of The Earth fell into my hands. So I've been working on an average of one Utterly Captivating Read every five years or so. Watching the last page of Name Of The Wind blink offscreen, I knew it was going to be another five years before I found one of those Utterly Captivating Reads.<br /><br />Now, that's not to say there haven't been other great books. Other five-star books. George RR Martin has written a few. So has Lois McMaster Bujold. Five-star books, through and through-books that I've read more than once out of a desire to travel into them again.<br /><br />But there are just some books that make five stars look like the sky on a cloudy night and beg for a constellation. Those are the Utterly Great Reads, the ones whose stories feel more real than the stories you know other people think are real.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting another Utterly Great Read for three more years. I wasn't due for one, you see.<br /><br />I certainly wasn't expecting it to be independently published, released in near secret and available on Kindle for less than the price of my usual Vente Breve Chai Latte at Starbucks. Seriously. This thing was three dollars. I swear to you I want to send twenty bucks and a bottle of Macallan to the guy who wrote it. It's that good. This is a book that should be in leather-bound hardback, smythe-sewn, gold tooling, deckle-edged paper. It's a book that costs less than a large bag of cheetos, for crying out loud!
B0009MAO46|5.0|My kid equally loves Toy Story and Cars. I went to Target to buy the 2 movies on dvd so I could stop paying to order them off tv. But it was over 40$ for both so Amazon was my best option. I not only got Toy Story much cheaper, but it was a brand new 2 disc 10yr edition and I had enough left to order the Cars dvd brand new too!
B007TML4EI|4.0|The game did not load initially.  Another try and it was fine.  The design and play are very well done.  Recommended.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Thank you so much! When i got Ben Howard in the mail, i was very pleased with how pristine the cd was. No scratches at all.

My son is a very happy boy and I'm happy I saved money...I will definitely order the rest the the movies here too (Toy Story 2, 3 Cars 2)
B003XQPYR2|4.0|This was a great movie.  It is full of action and it is well written.  Once again Russell Crowe does an excellent job defining and becoming this great character we all love Robin Hood.
B000Y5JFN4|2.0|There's only one word I can say after watching this Blu-ray: Depressing!<br />The characters are all non-entities, trying to find reason as to why they're existing in this world.<br />Maybe the problem here is, you have to be stoned, before watching? Since I wasn't, and I don't drink either, will just put this away in my collection, never to be watched again! (Although my wife make look it over when I'm not home?)
B005JE7WKI|4.0|This is a surprisingly funny movie with a simple premise: A group of college kids go out to a cabin in the woods and start dying horribly. However, their ominous-appearing redneck neighbors are not killing them. The deaths are a mix of accidents and the results of the kids attempting to strike back at the guys they think are trying to kill them. Sounds like a thin premise that would be hard-pressed to hold up for an entire movie, but it works out pretty well, with quite a few very funny moments.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun game I was never bored theres a game that u can always play I love it
B002KT3XH6|5.0|I love reading history about the Royals. Of course, everyone thinks of Henry VIII and his wives. It was interesting learning about the wives instead of the man. I don't know if I would have married him given his track record.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really cool app that i enjoy very much, i do wish it wasnt so hard to get enough credits to unlock new games though. its one of the best free games out here in my opinion.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is even better than season 1.  There is more plot and just as many beautiful scenes.  Love Maggie Smith.  Can't wait for season 3.
B000V8A95C|5.0|The music is great and it's a perfect addition to relishing the theatrical musical. I would recommend buying this if you've seen the musical or are planning on seeing it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the story line. Like the characters, and the plots. To see how the two \\"played\\" was intense. Loved how they evolved, and could be so tender. I am not into that lifestyle, but I did find it to be an eye opener.
B0047GNCSU|5.0|I got this book about two days ago and I'm surprisingly really into it I'm already half way through it by the way. Some people are saying her writing is dumbed down, ignore them Lauren is writing a Young Adult series and its written just as any other great author writes...yet she makes things a little more relatable because of age. But I definitely would suggest anyone who likes Lauren and the Hills or Laguna Beach to buy this book you will not be dissapointed!(:
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is so awesome it is twenty times better than the first game i so cant wait for new updates
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book, very sexy exciting and entertaining. I couldn't put it down. It makes you want your own Christian Grey...to a certain extent..:-)
B0042U2HN2|5.0|This 9-CD box is just incredible. Packed with recordings of pieces by Brahms (the two concertos for piano, trio, quintet, quartets, sonatas with violin, with cello, etc.) played by Rubinstein, you cannot go wrong. The older recordings seem to have been restored to a quite good audio quality. Rubinstein's performances are among my preferred in the case of Brahms.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|I have not yet read the book The Prestige was based on, so I can't give a comparison there, but I can tell you that this is a fantastic movie!  The acting was excellent, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the plot keeps you very interested.  This is certainly worth watching.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love It I think it is so fun its puzzles a a a a a a a a a a
B003SNJYSK|3.0|I enjoyed \\"Redbreast\\" (my first Jo Nesbo novel) but was very irritated by some glaring inaccuracies. The death century in South Africa was abolished when the new Government came into power in 1994. And Gnu's (wildebeest) migrating in their thosands across the Kalaharo desert? I think not. Jo Nesbo must be getting confused with the Serengeti and thus shows either an ignorance of Africa or was too lazy do any decent research.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Tarsem Singh is a filmmaker who honestly should have stayed a music video director. Seeing his finest work, the video for R.E.M's \\"Losing My Religion\\" and what a breathtaking visual work it is, it does seem like the next natural step for him would be breaking into feature filmmaking. He started out with THE CELL, the Jennifer Lopez \\"psychic thriller\\", that was very reliant on strange visuals and heavy use of color rather than the focus on the story or character or performances, all of which were totally forgettable. More recently, he did THE FALL, which was more acclaimed but still had similar complaints. Now Singh tackles Greek mythology with the same casual aplomb for character and momentum and performance and concentrates entirely on constructing visual beauty with IMMORTALS, which while being a feast for the eyes, totally forgets that we have other senses.<br /><br />It's very telling that this is a film being marketed toward Zack Snyder's 300 crowd while totally side-stepping the brash fun and glorious bloodletting that made that film the hit it was. Basically you have the tale of Theseus (Henry Cavill, our future Superman), a Greek peasant who is destined by the gods to protect all of Greece from the brutal King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, in some inspired casting) who looks to gain possession of the Maguffin... ahem... the Epirus Bow so that he can free The Titans (beings cast down from Mount Olympus when they rebelled against the gods) and destroy pretty much everything. Along the way, he falls in love with the virgin oracle Phaedra (Frieda Pinto) and makes a friend in the thief Stavros (Stephen Dorff) and along the way, he gains the respect and assistance of the gods. Yes, Theseus is THAT important.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the gods are the most interesting part of the film but they're given the least attention. There are a few fast-slow-fast bloody battle moments, particularly a scene in which one of the gods (it's not clear who it is, but I'm guessing it's either Apollo or Icarus) comes to save Theseus and Stavros in a particularly brutal fashion and is an extremely well-constructed and designed set piece, and there's also the final battle between the good guys and the bad guys where many characters sacrifice themselves and become legendary heroes in the pantheon of Greek history and blah blah blah.<br /><br />It's amazing really that most of the films based on or around the gods of Greek mythology have been so incredibly underwhelming. Both CLASH and WRATH OF THE TITANS were gigantic missteps, and IMMORTALS isn't any better. In fact, I haven't seen an action/adventure film recently that bored me to such an extent that I was literally falling asleep while watching it. And it wasn't that late and I wasn't tired. This film is just incredibly boring and the performances are just as wooden as the film. Someone must really see something that I don't see in Henry Cavill to cast him as Clark Kent/Superman in Zack Snyder's forthcoming MAN OF STEEL or really to cast him in anything other than a Calvin Klein ad. He's incredibly handsome, athletic, and chiseled, but nothing about his performance suggests that he's an actor or any considerable weight. Pinto, who has yet to show me anything of real worth, and has been relegated to playing second or third fiddle to better actors and even CG apes, is also nothing special here. Stephen Dorff is trying desperately to show that he can still be relevant, but his rogueish charm does elevate his performance somewhat. Rourke seems as though he's sleepwalking throughout this film until the gloves come off and the action requires his body to do something; his character always speaks in hushed, almost whispered tones that are supposed to indicate that he's a real Hannibal Lecter-type of villain, and it's a shame that such a talented actor is reigned in and not allowed to really sink his teeth into a role like this.<br /><br />The script by Charles and Vlas Parlapanides (Charles is a former executive assistant to Scott Rudin, and is the only reason I see that he was able to get this script out there) is about as stale, wooden and trite as can be expected from a faux swords-and-sandals actioner. The dialogue is as clunky as anything I've heard lately, but it really doesn't matter because all of the scenes they write are designed to give a backdrop to the visual tapestry that Singh weaves throughout the film. With another film highly dependent of golds and reds, the most dominant colors in his palette, Singh creates some truly beautiful-looking scenes within this film and obviously takes great care in his character design (some of the ornamentation on the characters, particularly the gods, are very inspired), but once again, that's all he brings to it. He brings no real sense of storytelling, pacing or momentum. All he knows how to do is make what we're looking at on screen really pretty, and sadly that will never be enough. To be fair, though, I would rather sit through a film of Singh's than that of a similar quality Michael Bay film, because at least the only style that Singh apes is his own. Again, Singh is far better-suited to the shorter narrative of a music video rather than a feature film because he can show a lot of pretty pictures in a four-minute time frame and doesn't have to worry about a coherent plot or characters.<br /><br />IMMORTALS is a film that is destined to be praised for its visual flair, reviled for its lack of anything substantial, and unlike the myths that populate this film, will be remembered by only a few.ecutive assistant to Scott Rudin, and is the only reason I see that he was able to get this script out there) is about as stale, wooden and trite as can be expected from a faux swords-and-sandals actioner.

B000W93CHC|3.0|Ensure you read the 1st book, Pillars of the Earth, before reading this 2nd book, you will understand the characters more and feel their troubles.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Catching Fire. I thought that it was much better than the 1st book, because there was more depth to the characters and a more interesting story line (Sparks of revolution! Love triangles! Finnick!!). Catching Fire also had many funny elements, but also some emotional ones. I thought that it was more humorous than The Hunger Games and wasn't as emotionally tolling, which is both a good and bad thing. Overall, I would say this is a must-read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|really cool but I kind of think it would be cool if when u tilted your device the liquid would tilt too.its not really necessary but it would be really cool
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Very good book. Surprising ending. It ends abruptly so I almost got upset because I thought there was no real closure but the epilogue explains things a bit.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I found the first book fairly interesting because it was so different and I was curious as to where the author was going with the plot.  By the end of the second book I realized there was very little substance to the story.  I was hesitant about purchasing the third book, but did so anyway.  I became bored with the repetitious sex-a-log and skimmed through<br />the third book hoping for some twist or interesting end.
B008602KQI|5.0|Arrived on time, and was cheaper than me buying at wal mart! nicely packaged. perfect as a gift or for yourself hahaha
B003VANOFY|4.0|*******NOTE: UPDATED REVIEW, Please see comment below.<br /><br />Original review:<br />-------------------<br />Wow, what can I say?<br /><br />Performance is great.... though it is very difficult to know if you accidentally hit a G key and changed your voice! For those wanting to use this for business (not gaming) purposes.... that sucks.<br /><br />Overall a 4.5 score.<br /><br />So.... why the 3 star review?<br /><br />I liked this headset so much that I purchased it again after my first pair broke. Right above the left ear the plastic stress-fractured. I owned the first pair for about 7 months. Wow.... imagine my surprise when the second one broke today. **Same place**. Had this one quite a bit longer (10 months).<br /><br />Overall.... Logitech has a good product line, just be ready to pay out for a new set in a year.<br /><br />*******NOTE: UPDATED REVIEW, Please see comment below.<br /><br />Earning a 4 star as their is still faulty construction with 4 screws being used on the plastic couplings. Basic Mechanical Engineering would indicate that this significantly increases the chance for stress fractures, which is exactly what has happened. (No, I'm not an engineer - used to work at an engineering company and managed projects.... so no expert, but I understand the basics.<br /><br />I'd give 4.5 if that was an option.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be this funny and entertaining but I was pleasantly surprised, this is one of my new favorites!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I was a bit skeptical to read this novel because i'm a really indecisive person when it comes to reading a book. Although, I did read John Green's, Looking for Alaska, I was afraid of being bored of the novel. TFIOS is a great novel and leaves you thinking. It has great quotes that leaves me questioning sometimes. But overall the book is wonderful. I am going to contiue reading more of John Greens' books :) I hope this helps any book worms out there.
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|The guy pretend that he lived in the wild, well not too fast you dumb dumb, or in another words like another customer said: A \\"hippie\\" more likely it's what this is, living in the area where there's a lot of snow (where in the wild will you find a school bus and a matress to sleep- that's not wild) and a film crew with a lot of life support does NOT qualify an individual to say it's the wild where he/she lives. To me these are spolied rotten grown-up kids that had nothing better to do with their lives(and money) othar than wasting their lives, what a shame. At least they should had gone and be enlisted in the military to do something meaninful.<br /><br />Save your time don't watch it, even for free for the Prime Members its not worth-it the time you'll spend.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This is by far the best series of books I have ever read. I haven't finished the kill order quite yet, but so far it is amazing. These books help you completely escape reality and fall into the story. Amazing.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I had first downloaded the free version and liked it so much I had to buy the full version. I have had a problem with getting to sleep and this has helped so much. I love being able to set the timer to turn off after the amount of time I chose. There are lots of sounds to pick from and you are able to save your favorite combinations. Another great feature I like is being able to adjust the volume of each individual ambience sound. Worth the money :)
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game is great for people looking for nostalgia. I hadn't played until this, and it's a true classic in my book. 1 problem, loading time. I had to wait overnight to load, and an hour or so after that.
B00846REIS|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book after reading the Fifty Shades series, but this book was just as good.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This film had good action and a main character that was fun to root and cheer for. This film had no cursing or sexual inuendo, which I thought was great and surprising. The plot was strange and a tad unbelievable, which was a distraction from otherwise very entertaining action and dialogue. I thought this film,  which had taken a lot of steam from John Carter at the box office would be grander, and deeply engaging. It really wasn't. John Carter had better twists and overall theme, thanks to Edgar Rice Burroughs. I did enjoy watching The Hunger Games on the Kindle Fire, an amazing product with a luscious display.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So many people told me it was a most read that I was kind of disappointed. The characters seemed unreallystic. The story is like a sweet valley high book wilth some porn. I rather read something else.<br />But if you buy the book you might enjoy it from time to time and is not bad, only a so so book
B007TTFXLQ|5.0|Amy MacDonald is one of the best singer/songwriters in Europe who has yet to gain worldwide recognition.  It is disappointing that a talent as good as her's has not been heavily promoted outside of Europe.  Whenever the record companies come to their senses and back her worldwide she will be, to quote a song from an earlier CD, the \\"Next Big Thing\\"
0345529057|5.0|It's common to hear rave reviews of the first 3 books and a lot of gripes about the last two. Here is the meat of the matter:<br /><br />Basically splitting Feast and Dragons into two books does indeed make an inferior read. But there is no reason to fault Martin's writing over this, which remains lucid, gritty, detailed, and historically rich.<br /><br />TO MAKE A MORE ENJOYABLE READ: I recommend you read A Feast for Crows concurrently with A Dance for Dragons.  There are websites you can google to see the best order in which to do this, but that's not really necessary.  Just read them more or less side-by-side at the same pace, switching back and forth as suits you. A Feast for Crows, which is much shorter than Dragons, ends much earlier, at which point you just continue to the end with a Dance with Dragons.  (Dance with Dragons is not included in this box set though, so you might want to order that separately.)<br /><br />At any rate, I found these to be the best fantasy books I've ever read.  As someone who has read Tolkien's main works half a dozen times, I can safely say these blow them away completely (no matter how much debt they owe to them). I loved every bit of these books and can't wait for the next two books (and hopefully they won't take as long as the others to write, since Martin has to keep pace with the Game of Thrones TV show now.)

B004JN1D2I|5.0|When I wrote [[ASIN:B008SHCBCW Beasts of the Walking City (Walking Cities Series)]], these books were a big inspiration for me.  Mr. Martin's characters are vivid and real, and they jump off the page and transcend the genre stereotypes you so often see in fantasy fiction.  Several things stand out about Mr. Martin's style:  1. Fearlessness in eliminating anyone, at any time, regardless of how major a character they are.  2.  No adherence to good or evil; his characters are real, and all of them have elements of both, and there will be many times where you're rooting for someone you were hating just a little while ago.  3.  No mercy: his characters are in for it!  There's no rest for the weary, and I'm personally thankful I'm not a character in Mr. Martin's world.  (Though I'm glad to be a reader.)  Yes, the later books could be a bit more condensed, and have more action rather than more discussion of what action might happen.  Yes, I'd love it if he was faster in getting the next book out each time, because you do tend to lose track of who some of the minor characters are and why they matter.  But for readers looking for immersion in another world, the grand sweep of Mr. Martin's imagination is hard to beat these days.  Fans of the HBO series will also enjoy the added depth the books bring to the characters you've already come to know.
B004DBWB8Q|5.0|When I first heard hotel california back in the late 70's I remember thinking this song is going to define the eagles as a premier group; and then they recorded the live version on hell freezes over, for anyone who is an eagles fan this version of hotel california is a must have.

B007VQ7EIM|5.0|I have this album from the HDtracks 24-bit 88khz and it sounded really good but I have to say the vinyl version sounds much better. the album was recorded all analog so its got that nice warmness to it. the vinyl I got was 180 gram and no surface noise or clicks or pops and the vinyl itself seemed pure without any imperfections you see on recycled vinyl. don't know if its virgin but sure looks like it. very good pressing, awesome album and well worth the coin. BUY IT!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 was interesting reading and held my attention throughout the novel.  I enjoy fiction and non-fiction that keeps me engrossed, even in this case despite knowing the factual ending.  I highly recommend this one.  It's a good \\"settle in for awhile\\" read.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|Everyone true movie buff has seen this film, and with so many good reviews, there isn't much need to review the standard version. However, I went to the cinema to see the 3D version, and I must say that if given the choice of a standard def film with at least some of the deleted scenes re-inserted, I would have taken that over the 3D upscale any day. I found the 3D effect to be relatively minimal on a cinema screen, and I don't feel it's a film that NEEDED to be 3D.<br /><br />Why ? - well, a criticism I had of the original release is that it ignores the Californian, the ship that was parked in ice about ten miles away, so if you had not seen or read \\"A Night To Remember\\", and were essentially a newby to the event, you would have no idea of the Californian. I mean, it is a major aspect of the tragedy that the officers of the Californian saw the rockets, but failed to investigate further by waking their own radio operator, Cyril Evans.<br /><br />The Carpathia is also largely ignored in Cameron's original release, except during the rescue of Titanic's lifeboats. Other films have shown quite well how Carpathia's radio operator, Harold Cottam, caught Titanic's distress call & delivered the message to Captain Rostron, who went immediately into action (unlike the crew of Californian, who even had visual indications that warranted some further investigation on their part, but failed to react).<br /><br />However, if you watch the deleted scenes, it makes reference to it. There are also some other areas of the ship that feature more prominently, such as the radio room, which was of course one of the focal points of the ship during the disaster.<br /><br />Even the deleted scene where Jack & Rose are chased into the 1st class dining saloon by Hockley's valet, Lovejoy, is quite tense. Outside of the radio room & Californian scenes that were cut, I liked the scene where Astor mocked the gym instructor when he said that he wouldn't wear a life jacket because it would impede his swimming stroke.<br /><br />I have always thought that Cameron could have even made probably a better film without using the fictional characters of Jack & Rose, as SOS Titanic (and while crappy in comparison, it's a pity the original cut of that film as released by Rank Arena/EMI isn't on DVD/Blu-Ray) is about the only one I can think of that featured hardly any fictional characters (even \\"A Night To Remember\\" had several fictionalized characters in it, as did the two mini-series that have come out). While SOS Titanic is a pretty average film, it does portray some great scenes, such as Jack Thayer & Milton Long shaking hands & wishing each other luck before diving into the water as the bridge started to submerge.<br /><br />So for me, while I did like Cameron's version of the film for it being the best rendition of the ship itself, and some great acting, it was disappointing in other areas as it missed out on some key aspects to the actual historical event. For me, it's another one of those films where having seen the deleted scenes, I regularly wonder why the heck some of these brilliant scenes, that would have improved the accuracy of the film, were sent to the cutting room floor & were never re-inserted for the 100th anniversary for the public to enjoy.<br /><br />NB (9/16/2012) - Since writing this review, and as this version of the film is not availabe, I bought the Australian release 3D Bluray. It should be pointed out that the 3D release for Australia (which is probably the same internationally) is on two discs, so if they are all the same, you will need to switch discs just after the scene where Thomas Andrews tells Capt Smith & Ismay that the Titanic will sink. Furthermore, I felt that the 3D depth in the home release is far better than what it was in the 3D cinema release, but the tenets of original review still stand - I would personally rather have seen some or even all of the deleted scenes re-inserted into the original theatrical release rather thana 3D release.a 3D release.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book gains your interest at the start and continues throughout. The ending was a bit soft.<br /><br />It sort of reminded me of George Orwell's \\"1984\\". Not very optimistic about the future.

B008602KQI|4.0|Enough mix of action and plot to keep the story moving. A couple of twists, as long as you haven't read the books, to keep it interesting. Nice and long, over two hours, for an evenings viewing.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I guess when you hear great things about this movie you see what is so great about it.  First i would like this is somewhat of a ripoff of a short novel most people (or I did) read in High School called \\"[[ASIN:0895986531 The Most Dangerous Game]]\\"  which has people hunting people written in the 1930.  There has been movies and story or even real historic events like Romans' gladiator.  I can suspend the reality/notion of older mature human fighting each other for glory.  There has been a few of those movies within that genre (mostly cheesy) like [[ASIN:B0030SBZCQ Gamer]] or [[ASIN:B001ILHY1I Death Race]].  But kids hunting kids, is disgusting to watch.<br /><br />Otherwise the movie is well written, well acted and it kept me watching the whole time.  I won't give too much away from plot just what the genre is and some movie sif you seen maybe like it.  Got that big brother style feel of [[ASIN:B004XNFNT8 1984]] or as in the great movie [[ASIN:B004SKLD9A Equilibrium]].  Also can't believe the main male character was the same one from [[ASIN:B003VDB9IU Bridge To Terabithia]] and he has grown.  Jen Lawrence is very impressive, much more then in x-men.<br /><br />I don't think keeping down another civil war or revolution involve watching people hunt each other as entertainment,  more counter intuitive that they will start one by these act.  But can humanity could be this cruel today?  Yeah people in power causing war and destruction, which I think the author is of the book was parlaying.  Any how many songs by Tori Amos are in movies, well there is another one here at the ending.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The movie was very entertaining.  I watched with my grandson and I think<br />  I enjoyed it more than he did (he is nine).  Would recommend this for all<br />  ages.

0307744434|2.0|The main illusion is that there's actually substance behind all the visual magic. It's easy to get hoodwinked by the concept and imaginative setting into thinking that you're reading a clever, magical book. But as soon as you stop and think about it, you realize that virtually nothing happens until halfway through the story, the interesting characters and plot *elements* are not enough if there's no solid plot, and with the exception of one of the antagonists (who really ceases to have any pull on the story after the beginning), the characters who have a major stake in the supposedly plot are actually pretty flat...the illusion dies away and you're left with 1) a great film concept that will shine if the director and screenwriters make up their own plot with the *elements* of the book and 2) yet another promising book concept that could have possibly been great with a good editor and some major, major, major revisions (or should I say--another 6 months to actually figure out a plot?!).<br /><br />Also: there are so many problems with the prose that you originally wade through trying to ignore. There is again, this illusion that the author knows exactly what she's doing and you just need to trust her. But in reality, there are just a lot of weird sentences that are totally fine and normal for a first draft...but that's it.<br /><br />I won't give the ending away, but it's so incredibly weak, you don't realize the climax has actually happened until the very very end when certain characters are philosophizing about interesting but irrelevant-to-what-really-happened ideas about reality and magic. When you finally realize what you're expected to be satisfied with, the entirety of build-up you trusted was going to pay off just crumbles, and I will say that I was sad to see it crumble. I so wanted these fascinating and promising elements to actually be put together deftly and with purpose. Alas. I felt totally bamboozled instead. The book wants to be deep--and could have been--but it's very, very shallow.<br /><br />The moral of this story is that ideas and characters and visuals are not enough. They're enough for a great film option, but it takes a lot more for a storybook to be great. I fear that our standards keep slipping...een--but it's very, very shallow.<br /><br />The moral of this story is that ideas and characters and visuals are not enough.

I have been waiting for this album and since i bought it, it has been on repeat. Lianne La Havas is perfection. Her silky smooth vocals and ethereal guitar string plucks send me into another landscape that is painted in the color of emotions. Worth EVERY PENNY!

B005HP2J66|5.0|One out of ten milestones in the history of cinema. What would there be new after the invention of 3D, it was a big leap? Most would ask that question. It was the same with coloured film some decades ago. they had the technology and the knowledge but needed a few years to understand its narrative and visual power. Herzog did the same with 3D technology. Not toying around with something the creator doesn't know what he has in hand but acquiring the full potential of the element of depth that is 3D. Not knocking the viewer with the film bashing against him outside the screen (this method can be compared to contemporary commercial music) but letting him inside to work in this manner a similarity to the subject of the cave.<br />As to refer to the comparison with the colour film it can be clearly stated that this work obliterates all previous achievments in 3D and all that will follow after. But since most are still unaware of the message of colour and the affection of color film which had a long list of followers (as eg. in David Lynch's latest films like Mulholland Drive or Inland Empire where the coulours were part of the story) this doesn't make a great difference at all and the other 3Ds will still remain films like we knew<br />already with the only difference there is is the extra costly plastification. (Btw there is a cheap method of testing this: Wathing a new 3D film eg Ice Age 4 in b/w...)<br />I first saw this film in an IMAX theatre nearby, best way to do this.<br />As for the content it has a lot to do with what is in this comment - the way of telling stories to reflect one's environnment and life, the methods used for this and the spiritual significance related to art in general.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I found myself not wanting to stop until I got to the end.  Makes me think about the time I have wasted worrying about schedules, when I should just stop and breathe.  The love story between Alli and Dor is beautiful.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The app is okay - it \\"freezes\\" sometimes on the Kindle Fire. But still easy to use. Don't know how to edit my boards yet like I can on the PC but I'm sure I'll figure it out.

B0055B7IPE|5.0|Grandparents will easily relate to the grandfatherly figure, enjoy and appreciate his character development during the course of the movie.  There is a bad guy and tension evoking conflict, but the turn of leadership of the pack of dogs is  interesting and even realistic.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a surprisingly good adaptation of the best selling novel, [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]]. We missed it in the theaters, so was happy to find it on Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; the story follows Kitness (Jennifer Lawrence), a resident of District 12 and next \\"tribute\\" to compete in the The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a yearly event set up in retribution for an uprising of the 13 Districts against the Central Government, and requires each of the surviving Districts to send two representatives, between the ages of 12-16 to compete in a fight to the death as \\"tributes\\". The acting was very good, with Lawrence being the standout in the lead role, Woody Harrelson was excellently cast as the mentor, and Donald Sutherland as the president. The special effects ranged from fair to outstanding and it was good to note that they were not the focus of the movie.<br /><br />This did have some moving and occasionally disturbing scenes (it is about kids killing kids), but it was generally handled tastefully and without a lot of gore. I had to pretend to not noticing my wife tearing up in a place or two.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Loaded ok, but can be frustrating to play.  Freezes in some areas of my screen.  Would be great if it worked better!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|this movie had so much hype i though it would be good. Unfortunately it turned out to be very predictable, and accept for the lead actress and a good performace by Woody Harelson the acting wasn't very inspired. The action scenes were not very exciting and I thought the competitors acted unrealistically, taking me out of the story. This is suppose to be the start of a trillogy or something but I didn't think the background that the story takes place in was good enough to support even one story. Overall its watchable and there are some interesting visuals, but not much else. Also the kid that plays the romantic lead is a terrible actor and I think that ruined the romance angle of the story for me.

1475143389|2.0|Kept getting emails  from the author requesting to review this  book so before I unsubscribed from his list I thought I would do exactly that. First off, as he states he is just an experienced lifter who got ripped. The further I got in this book the more I realized he must have good genes because his \\"science\\" is often false. I have issues with his views on a calorie is a calorie, which it isn't. And his idea of eating heavy carbs in the morning and not at night; to name a couple.. There are qualified, non-bias studies out there that show many of his principles are fundamentally wrong. The only reason I am giving this two stars is because I like his training methods of lifting heavy. I would personally rather read information from someone with a phd in this stuff who have actually read thousands and thousands of studies. I would recommend this book to a complete gym newby, because reading about this stuff is better than reading nothing at all.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|This DVD formatting is terrible.  This listing says there are three discs and there are four.  And the formatting that advances from one episode to the next doesn't work correctly so trying to be sure you are seeing all the episodes is a pain in the neck.<br /><br />The program is great.  This DVD is the worst we have ever had.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Just what i expect from an MI flick. Fast paced, action packed and full of surprises. Folks who gave thus a poor rating are taking it too seriously.  Lighten up.  This is not intended to be serious, thought provoking film.  It is purely for entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As Christian says, \\"We aim to please.\\" This final book of the trilogy does just that. Full of action, never a dull moment. And Anastacia \\" never disappoints. An amazingly exciting, uniquely wonderful love story.
B002UIE5GA|4.0|We enjoyed this movie. It wasn't your traditional suspense. It had a great twist! Not too scare for teenagers to watch either. It wasn't tortuous which I like.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|How terrifying must it be to wake up and find yourself in bed with a man you don't recognize, in a room you don't recognize, with no memory of how you got there, and when you look in the mirror, to see a reflection of someone you don't recognize. Your mind tells you that you're in your 20s and you expect to see youthful skin, not wrinkles and old hands. Before hysteria sets in, you also realize you don't remember anything in your past that takes you to this point in time.<br /><br />That's the premise of this story. The man in bed is Ben, Christine's husband and he informs her that not only is she married to him, she lost her memory because of a bad accident on an icy road, that her parents are dead and that she remembers things that happen within the same day while she's awake but that her short term memories disappear in her sleep and when she wakes the next morning, she goes through the same shock and panic, and he goes through the same explanation.<br /><br />But Christine gets strange phone calls from a Dr Nash when Ben is at work, someone she doesn't remember. But he directs her to a shoebox in her closet and a journal that she has been writing in daily. She starts reading and through her journal, she slowly manages to piece together bits of her life and memories. But at the same time, she realizes that Ben has been lying to her. About her accident, about her best friend, about a son they had and even about her work. Can she trust him? Can she trust what she's been writing in her journal? Are they memories or her imagination?<br /><br />I loved the way the suspense continued to build in this story, right up until the crashing end
B005IQZB14|5.0|I was surprised by how this story gripped me and never let me go.  I will look for more books by Cheryl Strayed.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really  like this game. It doesn't  give me any problems while playing. Its really fun and really makes you  think.
B005FITIGO|5.0|One of the great themes of modern literature and film is the banality of evil. The casual, gradual descent of ordinary workaday life into increasingly unethical, socially destructive behavior, often without our being aware of it. So that when we finally realize it, it's too late; we're trapped. The small, routine, mundane lies we tell each other in the course of our jobs, to get ahead in business, to get the edge; to succeed, to win, can eventually add up to enormous consequences, as they do here. In an ethically bankrupt system, fudging the truth can seem necessary, because not to might put one at a disadvantage. And so deceit becomes invisible, accepted, habitual. Everybody does it because everybody does it. And before we know it, we're the bad guys.<br /><br />Like GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, MARGIN CALL is a brilliant, unsettling look at the modern business environment, where the pressure to succeed damages not just the social fabric, but ourselves as well. Lying to each other is bad enough, but lying to ourselves is worse. In a system that rewards ruthlessness and punishes integrity, sociopaths rise to the top.<br /><br />There are no guns in this movie, no car explosions, no chase scenes, no digital FX, but MARGIN CALL is as dark, brutal and white-knuckle a portrait of evil as you're ever likely to see. The increasing sense of impending disaster is palpable, especially since you know where it's all headed. The characters are complex, finely-drawn and very human. And though no one is redeemed, they seem strangely sympathetic since we identify with (and pity) them, like hapless rats lost in a maze. As Jeremy Irons' character puts it, \\"We can't help ourselves.\\" In the end, all are caught in their own traps, selling each other down the river because, as Kevin Spacey's character says, \\"I just need the money.\\"<br /><br />But despite its grim subject, MARGIN CALL is too gripping to be depressing. And watching villains rationalize and justify themselves is always fascinating. It holds up a disturbing mirror to capitalism, so naturally some people won't like it. But it's a riveting, nuanced morality tale, told largely between the lines, and for those who grasp the larger implications, it is far more chilling than any action/thriller or horror movie.<br /><br />These Wall Street vampires are real.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|alot of fun. not too hard to figure out (without move limits)  but definitely makes you think. can 't wait for more
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun. I love to play old games and unlock new ones. try it you will love it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|So excited to add this movie to the collection! The first time I saw it in theaters, I hadn't read the book! Afterwards I read all three and now watching it again, I can fully understand and enjoy the movie! Looks great on blu ray and extra features are really cool if you into behind the scenes stuff!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|i did not enjoy this book at all... only read it because of all the hype and regretted it after the first chapter... will definitely not be recommending this book to anyone... !! no real storyline... just smutty poorly written porn... !!
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|This movie - produced on a shoe-string budget -is a CLASSIC!!!  This blu-ray presentation is very good, but not reference quality (keeping in mind the video technology available back in 1979...).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The characters keep up the tension in this third book, traveling through the Capitol, still umsure of the loyalties.  It was again a great read.  Even more powerful was the ending.  The last stand to do the right thing...  the constant sifting of self doubt and feelings.  These characters are so real, in this strange futuristic world.  Is it so improbable that this could actually happen?  I think the characters have a good ending...realistic for all they have been through together.  There is a feeling of hope for the future, but not quite the Disney version.  The characters all hold a place in my heart.<br />This is a trilogy I plan to read again.
0375826742|2.0|Yes, I finished Brisingr. I risked not rereading Eragon and Eldest, but thankfully, it wasn't needed - Christopher Paolini summarized the two again in the prologue to spark my memory.<br /><br />Spoiler alerts for those who haven't read Eldest yet.<br /><br />A great novel, except for the fact that Eragon gets annoying and ponders things far too much...<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT]<br />Christopher, I'm disappointed. I saw the whole Brom thing coming, I called that he would get a new sword, and I believed with a certainty that he and Arya would get closer.<br /><br />Honestly, with the exception of the dragon's heart-of-hearts, I wasn't that surprised by anything. It's still a great novel, mind you, and written well, and you can get into it. It just wasn't as shocking as I expected.[/SPOILER ALERT]
B0064NTZ6W|2.0|I'm a real fan of Das Boot... one of the best sub movies or war movies ever made.  I already owned a copy on DVD (which I liked)...  but the 2012 Directors Cut Blu-Ray edition is very disappointing.  Yes, the technical quality is somewhat improved from the DVD version, but the new story editing is an inexcusable mess.  In several cases, the editing diminishes both the story line and the perception of some key characters.  The new voices are distracting, the new translations and sub-titles almost seem like they were done by computer that doesn't understand context or idiomatic speech at all.  The new soundtrack includes some really cheesy background music in a couple of places and some new surround sound effects thrown in, apparently just to prove that they could.<br /><br />The original move is fantastic - but the 2012 Directors Cut Blu-Ray edition is really not the same movie at all.  It is quite mediocre, and at 208 minutes its a significant waste of time.  Get the original theatrical release instead.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It started out a bit strange and as always the book was better, but I enjoyed it and so did my husband who never read the book.  When it started It reminded me of a Mad Max kind of movie.  It started slow but got much better.  My husband liked it so much that he can't wait for the next movie and wants to read the book now..lol.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a wonderful read, an excitng and thought provocative story.<br />The characters are strong, the settings are distinctive and the message is home hitting.<br />This book will be re-read.
B00000F169|5.0|There's not much more I can to add to the reviews posted here.  AS a kid, I saw this film when it was released, and was blown away.  Remember, this film predates star wars and alien by years.  I had seen nothing like it as far as the space special effects, the talking bomb, the excellent ship, etc.  The space scenes still hold up, especially for the budget.  Sure, there are some cheesy effects and such.  But so what?  The plot, humor, and intelligence of the film far outweigh that.<br /><br />I have to disagree about the \\"hippie\\" comments.  I was on a submarine, and I think most other submariners would agree that these guys could have been on the boat.  They act a lot like guys I knew after we were underwater for a few months.  Lots of quirks and odd humor.  It's almost like Carpenter did research on sub guys for his crew.<br />They have hippie-like qualities  because they've just given up on shaving and hair cutting.  After all, what's the point?<br />But in the sequences where they're doing their job, they act just like a sub crew going to battle stations.  No nonsense, everything is like clockwork.  The Job is first.  I didn't really notice this until I got the DVD and watched it recently.<br />So see the flick with an open mind, and if you can overcome the silly effects in parts of the movie, you might get a few good laughs and think about the film the next day.
0345803485|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but after reading so many negative ones I just couldn't believe it. This has been the best book I have ever read. Never, has a book, been able to bring emotion out of me the way this one did. I actually cried at the end and now can't wait to read the second one to see what happens. I read a comment about either you love it or hate it. I think it depends on what you were expecting when you grabbed the book. If you are looking for a very graphic, raunchy, \\"action,\\" type story line, you're not going to enjoy it. If you are big into \\"real\\" BDSM, you probably won't like it.<br /><br />I just love it and can't wait to read the second and third edition.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is really cool and the music is peace full you can play up to ten sounds at once and its great to listen to when you need to calm down or if your not feeling well it makes relaxed a million stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a great sequel, bringing more depth to the story line.  The tension between the charcters hightens, keeping the reader's interest in this series.  Our hearts go out to the districts and the hardships.  Truly this makes us want the third book - we need to know....
0525953728|5.0|Very well written. My only issue with him is not censoring the profanity which appears way too many times.<br />It just covers so many good aspects and the author is clearly not the egoist only taking credit for himself.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Great book! A deeper insight into the first book and everything that went on. No longer just a literary porno lol.
0316044695|5.0|The shipping was fast and the book thus far is awesome looking forward to finishing it. Pick this book up fast and if possible get it as a gift for someone else.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Was a cool twist on a classic game. Well worth downloading had good fun playing this addictive game. A even better game that i really enjoyed though is rage of bahamut thats super addictive and well worth downloading. If u enter the code pky09690 then u get loads of in game money and a rare card to help you start. Thats definitely worth a download.
0783227434|4.0|So Ash turns from a wimp to a hero in part one, then a daft individual to a hero in part 2, and now he turns into an ass to a pain in the ass of a hero who can still pull off excellent one liners, slapstick extravaganzas, and comic relief throughout the course of an eighty minute movie.... okay, you have my attention!<br /><br />Plot: At the end of part two we see our humble hero getting sucked into a portal that leads him into the medieval era. Now if it had continued at how exactly part two ended, then it would've never had its epic opening scene, instead they would've believed in him all along.... Instead this beginning has him being treated as a crud-tastic enemy and thrown down into a pit, but as soon as he finishes the job down there the characters switch into the realization that hey, this dud could actually be useful. Although he is fed, pampered, and treated like a god gorging repeatedly on others vouching enthusiasm (hence the title of my review) he wants to return to his time and place. Can he say the right chant, retrieve the Necronomicon, and be sent back without unleashing evil.... Well, after everything I've said, what do you honestly think?<br /><br />Review: My attention was full on time and I was a mere 11 when I first saw this epic motion picture. And I am still yearning for a fourth movie. I hope at least the Remake is good. This movie is beyond brilliant, it did lack gore and a strong horror feel and it felt more like an action/adventure comedy rather than a horror comedy. But still, it works. It is always a fun watch and when the comedy comes in it never goes until the end credits roll. This movie was the biggest budget out of them all. It cost $13,500,000 to make and even though it wasn't a major success it still passed that budget in box office revenue making a little over $21,500,000! The special effects (including the epic battle at the end) and the props, set pieces, and constructed castles looked amazing and it made the movie even more pleasurable to watch! Was it as good as Evil Dead one and two? Almost... It is my least favorite of the trilogy but it is one of the best horror/action/adventure comedies I've ever seen!<br /><br />Acting: Bruce Campbell, He steels the show every time, Need there be said more about the acting, besides the rest of the cast acting cheek in tongue the whole film and succeeding in every way, there really isn't any other way to say just how much effort must've been put in by the actors, it's fun for me, fans, and critics all around.<br /><br />Gore: a blood shower, some sword impalings, and a little more!<br /><br />Bottom Line: What a great way to end a hopefully not finished series. This trilogy succeeds in every way and it will always be remembered to me as \\"The movies that each started new genres of their own!\\"<br /><br />Rated R for Violence and Horror<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10 (I'm guessing it depends what version you buy!)<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a love story above all else. There are lots of twist and turns, it will make you laugh, cry, and say oh no he didn't.
B003L77GRO|5.0|i am hooked on dexter. he is my hero, killing those that would kill us.  he is very good at what he does, and i enjoy watching him.

B004HAETGU|4.0|I've been a fan of Tangerine since I first heard their music in Risky Business.  Over the years, I managed to keep my old LPs, but have lost my record player.  Thanks to this album, I can relive some of Tangerine Dream's classic works.  I find them great music while working.  The music keeps my mind from wandering without the lyrics distracting me from what I am concentrating on.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. VERY well written and most enjoyable. Certainly one of the best books I've read in a while.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|what can i say? i am hooked on dexter. he is a modern day robin hood, protecting us from the  killers.
0061733199|5.0|This is a great book, I bought it as a hard copy to carry in my pack to use for reference in the field. If you are just looking to read this book and wouldn't want to carry with you, I suggest searching for it in PDF format on google where you can find it FREE! Ive read it and know what to expect within the pages and it's not convenient to carry a computer screen in the bush so I got the handbook version you see here. Take a look at it online in PDF format first and see if u like it before investing money in a hard copy!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this product 100%!!!! I recommend that anyone that wants something to make there pictures pop really needs to get this product!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Really great app.  Very creative and challenging.  I love that that it was a free app of the day.  I definitely would buy this app or others by it's creator.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i really like this game. i play it a lot at night. the only thing i would change would be to get rid of the commercials.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You will not be disappointed!  Keeps you on your toes! Fantastic ending to the three books. I could not put this book down. Can't wait for the next one.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|If you think that this is someone trying to mess with you and steal the name of The Dark Knight Rises, then you should avoid this at all costs.  That is because you are an idiot and don't realize that this is based on an amazing graphic novel named \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and not some cheap rip off.  Take a minute and do some research.  They aren't trying to steal your money.  Just presenting another in what i hope is a great DC animated movie.  No where does it mention Christian Bale or any other cast members of TDKR.  please head back to your ignorant hole and stop writing ignorant reviews of products you know nothing about.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I bought this in 2011 for my 13 year old son and he just loves it!!! We have had no problems.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i got this for my  husband so he could play solitaire when he is away from his computer. the only thing i would change is no commercials.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|this is an interesting book, I'm still scared of this guy as president but a good read!<br />believe a good race story
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I guess its OK for the Colorful people to starve the White trash. I turned it off after 30 minutes. Glad it was only a rental. Only good parts were the scenery
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My Amazon purchase was very fast and easy, I bought book one, read it in two days, can't wait to buy the next two...<br />I love the new way of buying and reading books ,the E-readers are the best thing to come along ,for me anyway...
B005FISBTO|5.0|i have to keep up with dexter, even though i cannot afford showtime anymore on  direct tv. thanks for putting it on dvd so i can watch him still.
B0067QPVJ6|2.0|Beware that Amazon is combining reviews of the original 1982 John Carpenter version of The Thing and the 2011 prequel with the same title under both films.  You'll find that most of the five-star reviews are for the former and the three-star ones are for the latter.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I enjoyed this book better than Fifty Shades of Grey.  I found it more realistic.<br />I felt the first book was way over the top and using my Kindle allowed me to skip parts when I felt like this.<br />I am currently reading the third book in the trilogy so let's see what the review for that one brings.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the only draw back is there are so many great ideas that I think when will I ever try them all. I like very very much how clean that most everyone keeps it. I can let my kids get on with me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i think it is really  neat to be able to  use my kindle to read the bible.  i thank whoever did this for us christians. i hope there are no commericals.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It relaxes me. I highly recommend it. I especially like playing it on my kindle while getting a hydro massage.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Yes, in a way, it was just more of the same (minus a key character).  Even so, I like that it does stick to its original blueprint.  I like this series exactly because of the action and the characters and the creatures.  This is the type of series I count on when I'm in the mood for mindless junk food.  It's so satisfying as you watch it with nothing of substance to get in the way of all those empty calories.  It's not deep, you don't have to ponder anything afterwards, it doesn't deal with important issues currently plaguing mankind; it's fun!<br />I look forward to the next installment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was definitely different than any other book I've read.  I did however, grow tired towards the end - just end it already - and then I didn't like it(the ending).
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the story, a lot of twists and turns....but I believe some parts were a little long and drawn out.  After allowing the reader to become involved with the characters and to get to know them so well - at least you thought you knew them - the unexpected ending was rather abrupt. I was left wanting to know more.  Overall a good read!
B003V4ATIU|5.0|I've already used this book for my undergrad classes and now that I'm working as a developer and having to re-learn C++, I've again found this to be an indispensable book. This book explains almost every feature of the language in remarkable detail. For the parts that it doesn't go too deep into, like STL, it still does a very good job of giving the reader enough information to become reasonably proficient.
B008M34CSI|1.0|Do not watch this unless you are being paid. I'm as happy with mindless action as the next guy, but unfortunately am cursed with an IQ above 60, so I could not ignore the premise, script, and acting, all of which were terrible.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was not the biggest fan of book 4 so it really made me happy to get back into the story with A Dance with Dragons.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I've always enjoyed Nightwish, but I've liked 2 other bands more and while they both put out CD's this year, neither of them can touch this one.  If Nightwish isn't the best band in the world right now, they ought to be.  Symphonic metal at it's best.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Love the song! I don't care  if the song doesn't sense, but life doesn't make sense. I listen to it almost everyday!
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love this game because I love puzzles and I love the music in the backtound I give this game a A+ I think its definetly a five star
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app. great for planning my wedding, classroom activity ideas for my school, home ideas and more. you can find anything on here!
B001N26GFM|1.0|It arrived on time but the DVD did not work.  It stops at a certain spot and won't go past it.  DISAPPOINTED ! ! !
B007SGM084|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy is not for the faint hearted. It is an easy to read adult romance fiction that is hard to put down. Yes, there is kinky sex and lots of it but the story itself is charming and fun to read. I'm glad I bought the set all at once because I would have went nuts if I had to wait between books. I look forward to more from this author.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I received this CD promptly.  I am amazed by the sensitive playing of Yo-Yo and the genius of Ennio Morricone.  In this case the music is superior and more memorial than the movies were - by far.  This was a great buy!
B003F5NSTW|5.0|The set out of this book was captivating- in the form of letters.<br />I enjoyed learning lots of new words! The author must be a walking dictionary!<br />The story had me hooked to the end, making me feel many emotions along the way.<br />The ending was a little predictable, yet fitting.
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|Very good, heart-felt movie about the struggles we can go through in life, and how we need others sometimes to help us through them. Would definitely recommend this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely love all three books!! I'm actually sad that I finished them because I love them so much!! You should read them!!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Interesting take on magic.  The characters are well developed and it's not just muscle, fighting and spell slinging.  In fact, magic isn't just thrown around like a D and D novel.  I liked it and I'll be looking for book 2.
B008XG1X18|5.0|really like Pinterest and very glad I could get it on my kindle fire. works good. so far no problems.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book and the whole trilogy were wonderful. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance  novels. Great job e.L. James!!!!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|It's a Reacher novel so you know you're going to like it.  The first few Reacher books set the benchmark and the last couple, including this one, are every bit as good.  There's a bit in this novel that brings back a section from another one - 'Reacher, alone, in the dark' - for those who know, I need say no more.  Reacher is at his enigmatic best....
0345525558|4.0|Victoria has struggled with life. Given up at birth, she has been tossed from home to home, never finding a family. Now aging out of the system at eighteen, it is time to make life her own and do with it as she please. She is lucky enough to have a few very important people enter life (Renata gives her a job, and Grant gives her his heart), and instead of following a traditional path, she creates a new one of her own.<br /><br />The title of this book comes from Victoria's love for what flowers have to say to those that can hear them. Back in Victorian times, people would use flowers to send secret messages. Lovers would use them to communicate love and passion, or the desire to meet. People would use flowers to express grief and joy. The aptly-named Victoria understands their language and speaks it fluently. She can bring people's deepest desires to light through the use of flowers.<br /><br />Victoria is damaged by her tragic childhood, and this has left her with a detachment disorder that doesn't permit her to connect with people. But she can speak to them through flowers.<br /><br />I loved this story. Some aspects were a little far-fetched, such as the fact that a baby girl in the system would not have been adopted in a flash, and would instead spend her life in foster care, given up over and over again. But it was sweet and touching, Victoria was just quirky enough (I love quirky characters!), and I really loved the language of the flowers. My favorite moments in the book were the ones where Victoria and Grant debate the meanings of the flowers, when there is more than one documented meaning. Fascinating!<br /><br />My final word: Delightful! That's it. Just \\"delightful\\"!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I fell in love with this app on my phone and was glad to know that it was avaliable for my kindle as well.

B00004Z45A|5.0|I listen to all kinds of music! And all kinds of bands, this is one of my fav bands beside Blood On The Dance Floor! This is a album with lyrics that are priceless, I did own this on cassette once! Now I bought it on Itunes which came with two bonus tracks making the Album 100000X Greater :O <3<br /><br />1.Papercut- Very good way to open up!

Its also got a realy good Rap drum beat to it. 5/5<br /><br />5.Crawling- Reminds me allot of the song Numb from there 2003 album 'Meteora'! (The begining anyway, 5/5 Its very soft, mellow and hard core with a bit of rap also one of the singles off this album.<br /><br />6.Runaway- Another single here! Amazing talks about running away from thoughts and tired of hearing lies 5/5<br /><br />7.By Myself- Another hardcore-metal track with some rap 5/5<br /><br />8.In The End- Last single stops here!

Ends Greatly like all there tracks! 5/5<br /><br />11.Cure For The Itch- Pretty much a skit! Very catchy NOMETTAL! This skit has some amazing scratchy DJ sound effects and stuff. Its more of a Glitch-Hop track if you ask me. 5/5<br /><br />12.Pushing Me Away- What a beautiful way to end the album! 5/5 <3 Great Song!<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br />Some of the versions on CD, Cassette, and Itunes may have included 2 bonus tracks<br /><br />13.

Great Album Rather You Own or Buy it on CD, Cassette or Itunes! I would cherish this album! <3
B008RV5K5E|1.0|After my scrapbooking workshop at the community center, there  is a local flea market at an abandoned grocery store that I like to visit on Tuesdays. It's about a two and half hour ride on  the bus so it breaks it up a bit for me.<br />Inside the flea market there is a dealer who sells Hot Wheels, car stereos and new movies. Many of which have not come out on video or the theaters yet.<br />Being a Batman fan, I was looking forward to the animated version of the classic story by Frank Miller. As my luck would have it,  the dealer had the movie on DVD for sale at his table. Suffice it to say, I was all too excited.<br />Then, things got worse. I left my wallet back at the community center when I was in the bathroom. It must of fell off when I took off my shoes and favorite pair of corduroys.  The guy said he would be there till five so I would need to hurry.<br />Just missing the bus, I had to wait an hour. The bus ride was two hours long because that is the full route it takes to get back to the community center located two blocks from the flea market. Gratefully, when arrived at the center, they had my wallet and corduroys and suggested I keep them together on my person.<br />When I got back to the flea market, the dealer was pulling down the cage over his table, but I was able to stop him as I yelled.<br />Even though he said he didn't have any change, I do feel that I got a good deal on the movie.<br />Finally, I made it home and went straight way to the tv mounted on the cooler in the corner of the living room to watch the movie.<br />To be honest, I wanted to like this movie, heck, I wanted to love it. However, I can't in good conscience do or say either. In fact, I have found myself even more polarized as I write this from my Tandy desk top computer.<br />Most of the time, I could not hear what was being said, and the rest of the time the video quality was about as good as when I would try to watch scrambled Cinemax late at night on my grandma's tv.<br />They must of realized this and gave up because the movie just ends. A lot of people say this, but I remember the book being longer in content and substance that what this offered.must of realized this and gave up because the movie just ends.

B008QDCZJ2|5.0|It amazes me how people always tend to compare a musical artist's most recent work to their last cd.  They tend to believe the artist must always try to produce more of the same style --- especially if their last work was a huge hit.  The Pet Shop Boys have never adapted this way of thinking and have always attempted to stretch musical boundaries at the risk of alienation.  And this is a testament of their genius.  \\"Yes\\" was a glorious production, to be sure.  \\"Elysium\\" is simply their most beautiful work and a masterpiece unlike anything they have ever done before.  Upon first listen, it might be a bit difficult to sink into especially after the glitz and glamour of \\"Yes.\\"  But listening to \\"Elysium\\" a few times over evokes such an emotional outpouring of sentiment and heartfelt longing that it becomes a journal of life and love, sadness and joy.  It's the Pet Shop Boys most  personal work.  Listen to the elegant refrain in \\"Requiem in Denim and Leopard Skin\\" and one is instantly transported to a dance floor of wonderful memories forever remembered in the heart as the best times of one's life.  I tear up every time I listen to it. Get the cd version which includes instrumental tracks of each song. The instrumental of \\"Give It A Go\\" is simply exquisite.  One cannot just listen to \\"Elysium\\"; one has to hear it.  There is a message running throughout the work, and it is a profound sentiment that we have come to be who we are through our life experiences, both good and bad, and that we will be ok.  Everything will work out.  And the Pet Shop Boys cannot be praised enough for bringing this comfort into our lives during these difficult times.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|This album is so priceless. Any new fan of the Black Keys needs to check out their older stuff. The heavier, rougher, blues never gets old.
0634049011|5.0|If you are just starting to get into guitar and music theory, this is a GREAT book. It is very well illustrated and has great exercises that will help you understand the material very quickly.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting the journey, you will learn all the basics and how to navigate the fretboard.<br /><br />I've been playing for close to 2 years but was  lacking deeply in theory. After reading and doing a few of the exercises I understand the fretboard a lot more.<br /><br />Worth the money.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I admit I was a bit hesitant when my wife ordered this movie. Within the first 20 minutes I was hooked. The movie was quite amazing and did not go at all the way I had thought it would. There was plenty of suspense and intrigue with just the right amount of fantasy thrown in. I would recommend this movie to anyone and look forward to the next one.

160459201X|5.0|Before writing [[ASIN:061554052X The Pi of Life]] I went through years of personal transformation. \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" is one of the guidebooks I read during that time. If you saw my copy you'd never ask if I enjoyed it. It's dog-eared, beat-up, and covered with hand-written notes.<br /><br />Yeah, it's that good!<br /><br />Joseph Murphy Ph.D., D.D. has an easy approach to the mysteries of your subconscious mind. He uses clear language, relevant examples, and has a knack with imagery that makes his book a pleasure to read.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" covers everything from \\"How The Subconscious Controls All Functions of The Body\\" to \\"Your Subconscious Mind as a Partner in Success.\\"<br /><br />I love the \\"Ideas to remember\\" page at the end of each chapter. Placing  the key points at the end of chapters was brilliant because it reinforces knowledge gained and aids memory!<br /><br />If you're on a path of personal growth, this book is a must read!<br />Roland Byrd
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Good stuff indeed. Just solid construction of a simple concept of puzzles. Can't go wrong, really. Would play again, for sure.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Knowing that the target market for this book was teenagers, I had wondered why so many adults seemed captivated by the trilogy.  My curiosity led me to buy \\"The Hunger Games\\" Kindle edition when it was offered at a low sale price, and I'm glad that I did.  Character development, plot and narrative are very well-crafted.  Overall, it was a fast and enjoyable read.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the abrupt ending.  It felt more like the first part of a single novel, rather than a stand-alone novel in a trilogy.  If you want a light, fast read, this will serve you well, but be prepared for the fact that it will demand that you now acquire the subsequent books in the series.
B007EZJKS2|4.0|The Last Unicorn is a lovely marriage of the book and the movie. Its illustrations are largely based on the movie animation, though the humans are mostly \\"toned down\\" so that they are recognizable but less caricaturised. Also, it adds back in a part of the plot and some small details that the movie left out. I do prefer Amalthea's look in the movie to the book, and of course the movie has a few things that they couldn't translate so much into the book, like the songs. Gorgeous.
1781161097|5.0|This Prometheus art book is mostly beautiful production stills and concept sketches done before and during the film's production. It has some simple, concise, and well written texts that give additional insights into Ridley Scott's creative process. It illustrates and descirbes Scott's creative ideas while reinventing his original Alien franchise concepts now that he considers it's central character, the alien itself, no longer frightening. Scott has expanded his Alien franchise's already big ideas even larger now by shifting the central theme away from the alien and back to the underlying human themes of curiosity, independent thinking and happiness. Scott elaborates on his method for this by his taking back and exploration of the original Alien's abondonded Space Jockey which was until now considered as the sacred cow of the franchise.<br /><br />Prometheus also integrates and extrapolates on author Erich Von Daniken's Chariot of the Gods theme of ancient aliens possibly populating the earth in prehistoric times. And this ancient aliens theme is also connected to the sub-culture of the Illuminati and its historical preoccupation with contacting our alien ancestors. So, Scott has now placed his Alien franchise sqaurely in center of ongoing global controversy about human ancient origins and implied moral imperatives.<br /><br />And while this Prometheus art book is as beautiful as the film is to look at, it also has many of the same unanswered questions actually meant to peak the audiences curiosity and inspire us to question authority in any form. Particularly when they're as hostile as those portrayed in the Alien franchise. Instaed of vegging out as Alien fan-boys demanding another cliched violent and now boring chest bursting scene, Prometheus raises the bar to challenge movie goers to actively  think about big ideas in an even bigger universe and our existance in it. Prometheus' mysteries reinvigorates the Alien franchise and lays the groundwork for yet an entirely new and better series of sequels and spin offs.

0525953728|2.0|First one on line for my library's copy and read it this Saturday afternoon. Very easy read, well written [thanks to co-writer for this]. This is probably my 5th or 6th Navy Seal book, and I've read the prior accounts of the raid from the New Yorker magazine as well as Seal Target Geronimo.<br /><br />Frankly, save your money and go to the library. This book is just another rehash of BUD/S training, Hell week, so ops including a short chapter on the saving of the Maersk captain. The section dealing with the actual raid only takes one long chapter and not much more insight than what has been retold [quite nicely in the very long New Yorker magazine article earlier this year]. So Bin Laden got shot unarmed....do we really care or does it really matter. He's dead, thank god!  You don't really learn anything else new...not sure why all the hoopla?
B001DE29SS|5.0|Well i do say, the performance was awesome, awe inspiring. I enjoyed the talkie very much. For someone who has never seen much of charleez work it was afilm about the man and his work.
B000I52LUO|5.0|I searched for this movie simply because it was mentioned in a list of dramatic physical transformations that actors have undergone for film role.  The story of Christian Bale losing a tremendous amount of weight for his role in the Machinist, and then immediately afterward, gaining it back so quickly for his role as Batman was intriguing to me.  I had no idea what the story was about, and for a few months couldn't find the movie because I kept searching for \\"The Mechanic.\\"<br /><br />Netflix doesn't offer the movie on streaming, and there is no way to even view what movies are available on DVD through them, unless you PAY for dvd-by-mail service.  (How I despise Netflix! The marketing mistakes just keep on coming with those geniuses.)  If there is a way ... they've done a great job of hiding it. Sorry, I digress. Rant over.<br /><br />It finally occurred to me to search on Amazon Prime Instant Video, under Christian Bale... and viola! I finally tracked down this elusive movie.  I was stunned by how powerfully good it was.  It's one of those movies that my mind kept returning to, the day after watching it.  The more I remembered the details of the movie, the more I appreciated what a beautifully orchestrated psychological thriller it really was.  It reminds me of the way I felt after watching \\"The Sixth Sense\\" years ago.  You don't fully appreciate how great it was until you've finished watching it. The Machinist is The Sixth Sense x 100.  It's smarter, scarier, and \\"real-er\\" (is that a word?) than the 6th sense ... and I really liked that movie.<br /><br />The movie is gruesome at times.  Also heartbreaking.  I can't believe anyone could call this movie \\"slow moving\\" because I found it gripping, throughout.  This coming from a person who just watched it out of curiosity, to see the physical transformation of an actor I didn't particularly even like!  After hearing the audio of his temper tantrum a few years ago, I thought this actor was a spoiled self-important, pompous ass.  Now, after seeing this movie, I understand his need to immerse himself in a difficult role... and he is really truly amazing at it.  I have a family member with schizophrenia, and much of his performance was very familiar and sad to watch.  I spent much of the movie convinced that his character had a classic case of Schizophrenia.  But the full story is much more than that.  If you are going to watch this ... don't read too many reviews here!  Because the beauty, scratch that, ... power of this film is the unfolding of the story.  If I knew how it ended, my enjoyment of it would have been diminished, I think.<br /><br />You MUST watch this film.  I can't believe I hadn't heard of it before.  Did it win awards?  Was it a sleeper or I just have been living under a rock?mpous ass.

0439023513|5.0|I loved this book, I thought it was a great ending to this series. I am really surprised by all of the bad reviews it is getting. People really expected a mushy fairy tale ending full of rainbows and butterflies? This was never what the book was about. The story is focusing on the devastations of war, communism, corruption, etc. I think the way that she portrayed Katniss in the end was pretty right on. Someone who went through all that would never be the same again. I felt that the author did a fantastic job of keeping it focused more on that (dark and depressing as it may seem), rather than completely switching gears and making it seem like life just continues on and everyone can live happy ever after. Yet at the same time she did give closure, by letting the reader know who Katniss ended up with, which was great. I love how even though Katniss was forever changed, she was still slowly able to move past all of the turmoil and try to continue living as best as she could under the circumstances. Awesome job Ms. Collins!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Overall I loved this book. I believe the other reviews are correct where the book took off, slowed down in the middle and then took off again. I kind of hoped for a different ending, but now cannot wait to read Gillian Flynn's other books. I also cant wait to see the movie!!
B009329ZF2|1.0|this movie sucks so bad I would not subject the most enthusiastic sci-fi fan it to, it really sucks on all levels, that must 20 words, but the only one that counts is it SUCKS.
B000002JKA|5.0|I remember the general feel in the air around '92 of indulgent guitar solos and complex song structures suddenly being considered passe....no, more like FORBIDDEN if you wanted to be fashionable.  So it was a relief to hear DT for the first time on Images and Words going for it in a way I had not heard before, with songwriting chops to match their technical mastery (they even had a minor MTV hit!).  As a guitarist and recording enthusiast with major interest in this type of music, it was like CPR at a time when I was running low on inspiration and wondering about the future of rock.<br /><br />After the artistic and even commercial triumph of IAW, Dream Theater went atmospheric with Awake, a very moody album with a wet, reverb drenched sound and a more organic drum sound in stark contrast to the dry, tight sound of IAW, which included electronically triggered drums.  Even more than IAW, this album started a fire for me!  I wasn't into the Korn (non)school of 7-string guitar, so to see and hear Petrucci with an Ibanez UV7 was total inspiration (I bought one shortly after hearing this album, still have it).  The band had obviously grown in 2 years since their major label debut and the result is unique in their entire catalog. This album is the zenith of Petrucci's Ibanez Picasso guitar era (very lustworthy and rare guitars now) and includes the classic instrumental Erotomania.  The Mirror is an amazing 7-string showcase and was one of the first times I had heard one played like this. I can only describe that song as a cold, slow burning blue flame.  Hypnotic. I listened to Awake again for the first time in a few years before writing this review, and it sounds better than ever to me now, the sign of a great album. This was when DT really reached out and mastered the art of atmospherics and longer song structures.<br /><br />Keyboardist Kevin Moore was less intrusive than the others who followed and he made his best contributions on this album on  beautiful tracks such as Silent Man, Lifting Shadows Off A Dream and Space Dye Vest. Although I absolutely get the contribution of Jordan Rudess on the last several albums, the Kevin Moore era is still my favorite in some ways. Regardless, I'm glad we've had both.<br /><br />I've often said the best DT albums could used as movie soundtracks, and this one would make for a very dark movie, indeed. Like the music, not for everyone.  But to those who get it, it's in its own class.as Silent Man, Lifting Shadows Off A Dream and Space Dye Vest.

1401322786|5.0|As a consistent fan of Albom's work, I have been counting the days to get my hands on this book. I spent all day reading it, and whereas it probably is not my favorite of his books it is still touching and wonderful.

B000ICLRIE|5.0|This movie does not belong to the list of regular Hollywood movies that commit serious historical mistakes. It presents you with a lot of great scenes, shots, battles and with an impartial view of the conflict involving east and west, religion and insanity. The best part is that one of the historical sources of the conflict in today's Israel is shown: the crusaders, bearing stupid religious motives, began the massacres. They (the crusaders) took the first step in feeding this conflict, which affects us even nowadays. Definitely recommended!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|The Sheikh of Yemen (Amr Waked) wants salmon fishing in his country which the British government is willing to do. Dr Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) and Harriet (Emily Blunt) are thrust together on the project. Both are stuck in relationships with other people and can't move on. The salmon becomes a metaphor for their lives as their DNA forces them to do the same thing, i.e. staying in their comfort zone. The fish movement to Yemen is symbolic that we can move on. We just have to have faith.<br /><br />The production is a typical indie flavored with bits of humor and a warm fuzzy side of philosophy. It is in a way a romance, but not your typical romantic comedy. It is a good date movie, especially if you are dating a married man that is having trouble leaving his wife...or on second thought, maybe not.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE:  F-bombs, no real sex or nudity.

B005LAIIPS|3.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />If you have seen the trilogy then there are really no spoilers in this film. The movie picks up where the last one left off, meaning this will be difficult to follow if you are not familiar with the trilogy. Treadstone, a secret CIA assassin operation is being shutdown and all loose ends are being eliminated...meaning anyone who can spell \\"Treadstone.\\"<br /><br />The film concentrates on one operative Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who fakes his death to survive. Now a great flick would have been Jeremy going back and taking out the CIA men who seek to kill him. But they didn't do that...yet. Instead they interject Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing to create a bizarre plot only to end nearly the same as the first Bourne film.<br /><br />In the next film, Rachel will be killed and Aaron will have to go after the assassin and then apologize to the families of people that he has killed... unless they can convince Matt Damon to come back. Hopefully this is just a tie-in film like \\"Star Wars 2\\" and not meant to be great.<br /><br />What we loved about the Bourne series was the \\"MacGyver\\" aspect of Matt Damon being able to create something out of just about anything due to his elite training. I didn't get enough of that. I didn't \\"feel it\\" like I did during the original trilogy. There were no great lines like, \\"If you were in your office we would be having this conversation face to face.\\" I was disappointed in this film which can be added to the list of lame blockbusters that has come out this summer, with a few exceptions.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

Besides having mastery over the fundamentals of grammar (he actually knows how to use 'comprise'). he manages to be descriptive entertaining, and captivating.

B002KS1IJC|3.0|This movie starts out with a strong premise; outlanders crashing to Earth from outer space but without the benefit of an explanation as to how that may have happened. It quickly became obvious this was the founding idea for the FPS video game of the same name. To me, it simply came across as a potential FPS with many of the FPS trappings i.e., it could go on and on forever with no \\"winner\\" or end in sight and the main character could \\"buy\\" his armor (which he willingly gives up with no explanation early in the movie) and his \\"lost\\" weapon. For the most part, it was a good storyline as a basis for a FPS video game but it was lacking in the dialog and acting departments. Some may enjoy it.
0425263908|4.0|Ummmm, wow! I wish I could leave my review like that and hopefully that will spark some people to check this book out because of their curiosity.<br /><br />Okay, lets go for it. Is this book being compared to Fifty Shades of Grey? Yes. Have I read Fifty Shades of Grey yet to compare it? No (but it is on my list of book to read.) Eva has a dark past; a past that can pop up and haunt her at any moment but it doesn't stop her from living. And life starts to get fun with Gideon Cross jumps into the picture. Just the author's description of him in the first chapter had me drooling. I so badly wanted to run into Gideon like Eva did (my fingers are still crossed that it is going to happen one day.)<br /><br />Gideon sees her and immediately wants; knows that she is his and has no problem being very blunt about his need for her. So they strike a deal that their \\"relationship\\" is going to involve but once it starts, they realize that they are so drawn into each other that this is going to be more than just sex. And this relationship is screwed up on so many levels that there is a constant fight to make it work. Their pasts rear its ugly heads and throw them for loops but they cannot not be together.<br /><br />What I really liked about this book was that these two characters are not the perfect people. They have horrible pasts, they are flawed because of it, and things don't always go well for them in their relationship, but they honestly fight for it in the long run.<br /><br />I know that you are all asking yourselves \\"Did she add Gideon to her husband list?\\" The answer, yes I did!<br /><br />~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~

0071624058|5.0|For TOEFL, I have gone through a lot of books - Kaplan, Princeton, Barron's and Notefull.<br />The more books I went through, I got more confused regarding exam format and pattern. Each was following its different way.<br />Finally after taking the TOEFL exam, I can vouch that Toefl Official Guide is closest to the exam format (same goes for Notefull too).<br />For each section, here is my feedback on book -<br /><br />1. Reading - Exactly same level and pattern as in actual exam. Some people here had complained that level for reading is tougher in actual exam. However I did not find that so.<br />The pattern of reading is as in actual TOEFL.<br />Kaplan and Barron - they are using tougher paragraphs for reading kind of which I think will not be asked in TOEFL. Also TOEFL strictly mentions the paragraph number on which question is based. However Kaplan and Barron they are asking questions based on complete reading passage which I think is anti-preparation.<br /><br />2. Speaking/Speaking/Writing - Again exactly same level and pattern as in actual exam.<br /><br />The problem with Kaplan and Barron is that they do not stick to question types as prescribed by TOEFL.<br /><br />I have given 5 stars for sticking to exam format ( and not for strategies).<br />Being an official book, I was not expecting any strategies from this book.<br /><br />For strategies, Princeton, Notefull, Book by Bruce Stirling are good choices.

B00962ZOOA|5.0|You can almost see a woman's soul. This album is so emotional and true.<br />Most of the song speaks about one's experiences in life. Very nice selection of theater/musical tracks which are very personal to Melanie. Hands down for Melanie's versatility, from upbeat club music to the very relaxing classics.. Melanie can sing it all. She can really sing. Being an indie artist, she can do whatever she wants without the restrictions of the big record labels and without the pressure of the charts. I adore her as a woman of strength knowing that she is having a bit of ups and downs this year.<br /><br />This album showcases the versatility of Melanie's voice which is complemented by the rich arrangements. My personal favorite is a Nina Simone cover, \\"Ain't Got No/ I Got Life\\" and her duet with Emma Bunton, \\"I Know Him So Well\\".<br />I highly recommend this album.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|I recently found out that a new \\"uncut\\" version of this sick, twisted, and totally brilliant film had been released.

But when I saw that the running time on this new version was 104 minutes, I decided to roll the dice and ordered it so that I could finally own a decent copy, and for all intents and purposes, this new version is the best one available so far.  Here's what you should know:<br /><br />1.)  The film is uncut. That's the main point.... The official release date on the one I ordered was May of 2012, and THAT'S the one you need to buy if you want the truly uncut version of this disturbing film.<br /><br />2.) If you do order this new version, the film will satisfy you (provided that you are a fan...), but you WILL be disappointed with the packaging.  I didn't read anything about the packaging before I bought it, and was certainly skeptical when the DVD arrived in a slimline CD jewel case, attached to a DVD-sized piece of cardboard.... When I say \\"DVD-sized\\", I mean the horizontal and vertical measurements, NOT the width, which is about half the width of a normal DVD case, made from a cut piece of cardboard.... seriously.  The picture on Amazon looks like a normal type of cover if you just glance at it from a distance, but the only art to be found in the packaging is a typical plot description, like the backside of a DVD cover. But the plot description is in fact smaller than a DVD cover, and is merely pasted onto one side of the cardboard cutout. The packaging has all the makings of a bootleg, BUT, at this point, I'm happy to finally have an uncut version on official DVD media.<br /><br />3.) Despite the \\"bootleg-type packaging\\", the quality of the film print is impeccable. Quality of the DVD itself is totally good, so don't worry about that.<br /><br />4.) This version of the film is uncut, but the DVD has NO special features whatsoever.  You can obtain a digital copy, but you must have or set-up a FlixFling account, then you enter the promo code in the DVD package during the checkout process, and you do NOT have to enter credit card information.<br /><br />5.) I do not understand why Amazon hasn't split the reviews of the various versions of this film into separate review pages.... If ever separate review pages were needed, it would be for fans of this film... so I specifically urge you to buy the same version that I did... the release date of the DVD was in May of 2012.<br /><br />6.) If you have not seen this movie, you need to read some things about it or ask a friend who has seen it to describe some of the content contained in the film.  Because, quite frankly, this is probably the most twisted, sick, messed-up (can't use curse words here on Amazon, but I mean, MESSED UP with an \\"F\\" word in the place of \\"Messed\\") and disturbing film ever made.... The only two films that I've ever seen that rival the graphically sadistic and disturbing content of this film would be \\"Salo: 120 Days of Sodom\\" or \\"Human Centipede 2\\"...Maybe \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\" or \\"Martyrs\\", but I digress. In other words, if you are easily and deeply affected by sadistic, offensive, sick, nasty, vulgar and disturbingly shocking films in a major way, you NEED to read about this film before watching it... Then again, I could provide SOME brief insight with no spoilers, which is key if you are going to enjoy to the film. A shocking film can't shock if you can't be surprised by the shocking parts. So, without much detail, this film contains every kind of depravity that has ever been conceived by humankind when it comes to sex. It's not just explicit sex that you might catch in \\"Boogie Nights\\" or \\"American Psycho\\" or some films like those. The plot centers around pornography, and the film in its uncut form pretty much IS a porno film. Quite literally from the opening scene till the end. So much explicit sex is in this film that that fact alone will make some people call it \\"garbage\\". But, it's not just pornographic sex we're talking about here. Total graphic nudity. The most extreme rape scenes you will ever see. In many scenes, children play a key part in the FILMING of the pornography. We also have LOADS of gruesome violence that goes more over the top that any film I've seen, MAYBE other than \\"Human Centipede II\\". Maybe. But, this violence will affect your brain more than your stomach. In short, this film should probably not even be viewed by anyone under the age of 25. FOR GOD'S SAKES, DON'T LET THIS FILM FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A CHILD. I think it would be considered by the police to be \\"contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\\" Speaking of delinquency to minors, the kids in this film witness sex, violence, drugs, and yes, pornography. That's as far as I'll go, but believe me, words can't really describe the explicitness of the content of this film. As close to a pornographic snuff film that you'll ever see. Only this film actually has production values. The film does however have sociopolitical undertones about life in Serbia. This will not be easy to see for 1st time viewers. You may think I'm nuts if you watch this film after reading my statement there. But, it's true upon subsequent viewings. There IS subtext, but the film is dominated by the shock value.<br /><br />7.)  Despite the bootleg-type packaging and complete lack of special features, I am totally satisfied with this purchase. I'm a gore-hound sometimes in my horror film tastes, and I've never understood why this film was so hard to distribute in \\"uncut\\" format when films like Human Centipede 1 & 2 are sold in Target and everywhere else.  Without the scenes that were chopped in earlier releases of the film on home media, the film loses SOME of it's shock value, but either way, it's still pretty darn disturbing.  For my money, if you are going to enjoy a film like this, then the Uncut version released in May of 2012 is the way to go if you like this film.<br /><br />8.) Enjoy! It's just a movie.... most people will hate it, some will love it, but the film is one that you can't \\"unwatch\\" even if you only view it once.  But, my advice, grow a pair and have the moxie to take the whole horrific film in, then you'll have an experience seared into your memory for life, for better or worse.<br /><br />9.) Please give me a \\"helpful\\" vote if this review was informative.  I'm no professional, but Amazon reviews are an occasional hobby of mine, so it's kinda fun racking up some \\"thumbs up\\" type of votes. What can I say? I'm a dork obviously, but in my defense I don't play video games or Facebook games often, if ever, due to my workload. Like I said, this is a part-time hobby of mine. I may not be a professional, but I do really try to only help with items that I am very familiar with and like personally.<br /><br />A Serbian Film - Uncut, finally.... the entire 104 minutes. It's only version to watch if you're going to watch it.  Get sick and twisted one night, and brace yourself for a very shocking and disturbing, yet brilliant film.  Peace.<br /><br />P.S. - I just read a really nice review that you should check out as well here on Amazon for this film.  Read \\"Life Of a Victim\\" by Dante Golio, a customer review as good as any professional summation of the general overview of the themes and plot of \\"A Serbian Film\\", very nicely written. Peace.ill the end. So much explicit sex is in this film that that fact alone will make some people call it \\"garbage\\". But, it's not just pornographic sex we're talking about here.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have downloaded this application a couple of times and I love it. My wife also enjoys reading it while she is on the road traveling. I also have a chance to use it at work when I have my quiet time which is not as often as I would like.<br />The download was easy and it didn't affect my device negatively.<br />Thanks
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is the best its not for little kids be really fun to play y'all stupid for saying its dumd
B0068TL23G|5.0|I started off this puzzle game thinking it was too easy and simplistic. Naively, I thought it wouldn't be possible to make complicated puzzles with this scheme. Boy, was I delighted to be wrong! The game gets harder after an annoyingly slow start. And it's packed with puzzles - I never made it to the end, despite playing for hours.<br /><br />Happy puzzling!
B0086DBE62|5.0|As the title says.  If you expected this to be anything but a breezy flick with some overdone but entertaining acting and a witty if not completely original script then you had some very unrealistic expectations.  Just sit down get something good to eat, some people you love, and enjoy the silliness, the sweetness, that is a modern Snow white.<br /><br />I also appreciated the message inherent.  In a culture that obsesses over beauty this a breath of fresh air.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This app works exactly as advertised.<br /><br />It plays chess.<br /><br />It plays chess at an adjustable level that is capable of beating me (rating 1400?).<br /><br />It is free, and has ads.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend it.<br /><br />Happy chess playing!
B000YMDQQ4|3.0|First, I have thusfar thoroughly enjoyed my shallow foray into the quirky and delight-filled weavings of Neil Gaiman. However, to prepare the next reader, I'd stress that many of the \\"short stories\\" of \\"M is for Magic\\" are unfinished ideas, uncompleted beginnings of stories, and Stress, that they have not, in this collection, been brought to any sort of real conclusions. For me, those non-fatal, but unhappy longings were experienced in most of the \\"stories\\" in \\"M is for Magic\\".  I just wanted some form of endings!<br /><br />Now, this may just be me - but there it is, from an honest reader, and to you, offering an honest opinion about my experience.  This, also, honestly:  I HAVE come to appreciate the wonderful, deep, long immersions into Neil Gaiman's Full-Length delightful, and strange novels, ever, ever so much more!
B006ON41FC|2.0|It's not a great game.<br /><br />It was fun to waste time with for a little while.<br /><br />The OpenFeint thing sounds bad, but I admit I don't know much about it.<br /><br />Happy gaming!
B0055AUSAM|5.0|I have been wearing Teva product for 15 years. I live in FL(not CT anymore) and I pretty much don`t wear anything else. This is the best sandal I have ever purchased. The price was right too
B0055SWM08|5.0|Smartphone games are tough to do well, but Quell is great. Because it's a puzzle game, there's no annoyance at the imperfections of a capacitive touch screen on a slow computer.<br /><br />Happy puzzling!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun to pass the time. dome games are more challenging than others but its a nice distraction either way. the only issue is that points to buy new games get progressively harder to win so you have to go back and play old games that you already beat.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I like the way this game challenges you to think through all the options and gives you time to do it. The answers are certainly not easy one you get past the early stages. Great game!
B004N4IHU4|4.0|If you like stoner rock (Fu Manchu , Kyuss , etc) you will like this album. If you like Black Sabbath you will LOVE this album. Great rocking riffs and hooks with some tambourine thrown in to make you shake your ass!
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Instantly one of my favorite records that I own.  As a fan of soundtracks and similar music, this fills all the requirements.  As I tell my wife, it's like the middle bite of the sandwich.
B004MQ9W4I|2.0|I have to agree with VRegina, this looks like a highschool film project...at best.  I wish I could get the 1.5 hours of my life back that I spent watching this farce.  It even claimed to be the \\"Director's Cut\\" but it seems any director worth his paycheck never would have participated.  It is a self-indulgent, low-budet hack job.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Quality,Quality,Quality,A remarkable 3d experience,simply breathtaking from start to finish.<br />A must buy the picture and audio are reference standard.<br />I have watched many films in 3d and this is without doubt the one to show your system off to friends.
B004RLO0EA|4.0|Awesome take down on some old rock hits. However 10 bucks is too much a price for what you get.
B004SN783M|5.0|Third pair of barefoot runners i've had, and these are by far my favorite.  My favorite piece to it is that the toe is a little thicker than the heel -- this let's you focus on running more naturally, yet still land with the toe first.<br /><br />The fit is great, and they seem sturdy enough that i'll need a pair when they're stink to high heaven, but i bet they'd still hold together fine.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very interesting. This is definitely a \\"page turner.\\" The only draw back is there are a lot of sex scenes in the book and the vocabulary is quite extensive.
B008764ZQ4|4.0|As long as you remember that you are purchasing a movie soundtrack and not the songs as performed by their original artists then you won't be disappointed.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|Wonderful app for kindle fire. The sounds are especially good with headphones. I like layering combinations made more unique by the ability to play each at a different volume.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|Fonda, Bronson, Coburn....INCREDIBLE SCRIPT....GREAT STORY LINE...AND THAT  HAUNTING TUNE OF THE HARMONICA...GET THIS MOVIE...YOU TOO, WILLL WANT TO GIVE IT 50 STARS*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to have my pinterest available so easily to me.  It has been so wonderful to easily pin and look at mother's boards.
0735619670|5.0|This book is a great guide to the whole software development lifecycle. From requirements gathering to developing to debugging, it offers insight, common pitfalls and tips. There is so much detail in each topic, it feels as if years and years of industry programming experience condensed into one book. Incredibly helpful in getting someone up to speed for working in teams as well as architects and leads wanting to organize and plan large software projects. I'd recommend this for anyone working with software as it is a great guide to go by as well as to understand why processes such as requirements gathering and writing tests are necessary.
B003VBVQKS|5.0|I have been a fan of Deep Purple and Tommy Bolin since the 70's and I will admit at first I wasn't a huge fan of this album. I bought in on vinyl in the early 80's and at first I didn't quite get it. Don't get me wrong. I liked it, but Tommy's style is so different than Ritchie Blackmore's, and I liked Ian Gillian's vocals more than I did David Coverdale's. As the years went by, I got older and I appreciated this album more and more. One of my complaints was that the mix was always a little muddy, especially on the CD I bought several years ago. This remix cleans up the muddiness for sure and brings the bass and drums more into the mix. CD1 is basically a remix, and it shines. Every instrument is clear and each performer gets their chance to showcase their individual talents. Tommy's work, as always, is incredible. Even in the throes of his ever growing drug addictions, he turns in a stellar performance on guitar and echoplex. CD2, with I think is a different remix, is pulled from the master tapes and a few of the songs are longer, allowing the band to finish the songs instead of fading out on the original version. Tommy in particular, gets some added time and it is well worth it. There are also two songs that have never been released. One is Same in L.A, which is probably and outtake from the album and is a fine short song with limited vocals. The other is a five minute scorching jam with just Tommy and Ian Pace that showcases Tommy's extordinary guitar work, as well as Ian's fantastic drumming. If you are a fan of Deep Purple, but can't comprehend anyone but Ritchie on guitar, give this a listen. If you are a fan of Tommy Boiln, and never heard this album, or only had older versions, give this a shot, you will love it.
B003YUC2FE|2.0|The blu ray and dvd's in this collection were fine, but the digital copies were worthless.  Would not work because they had been used.  Didn't say that in the description.  Quite disappointed because this was the reason I purchased the trilogy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love my e-reader, syncs to the device that has read the furthest, changes font when needed, and the selection and price for texts is great. Have had a few texts though that couldn't be read on phone but easily read on PC and Kindle fire.
B007JF87VS|5.0|One of the best episodes so far! The acting is amazing! I cant stop watching this show.Cant wait for the new season to begin!!
0345803485|1.0|Poor dialogue, poor plot, poor geography, every facet of it was beyond belief.  Please do yourself a favor and purchase something else.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love being able to start everyday with different information along with intelligent games that help my aging brain functioned at an excellent level.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|This incredible collection of zz top's finest is like tone school for guitarist. It's zz top, it's all good, get it now!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Overall a fun read, especially if you are into gaming and are old enough to catch the many references from the '80s.  Was a bit skeptical at first because I thought I wouldn't enjoy the book as much because I wouldn't get all the references to 80's culture, but it got me hooked and I don't regret picking it up.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, I almost couldn´t stop until I finished it, it took me to a very exciting erotic phantasy, with some polemic aspects of human sexuality, pleasure and pain, dominance and submission. I would recommend it to very open-minded people, free of prejudices and ready to give in to their phantasies, ready to enjoy unsuspected pleasures and go up to their limits.
1401940676|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best books I've read and subsequently listened to in both hardcover and audio format.  The understanding Anita was given of why she developed cancer and then healed very quickly, confirmed the information on energy healing that I've been studying for over 20 years. This book will challenge many core beliefs that have been part of the programming during ones lifetime, yet it is the dismanteling of those very beliefs with a new way to perceive life, that rearranges the cells that were in chaos back into harmony and good health.  The audio format was wonderful to listen to while in the car and afternoon quiet time.  It would be especially helpful for those who may be unwell or unable to read.  Her voice is very soothing and you will feel the essence of her beautiful soul as she relates her story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its a great way to use pinterest and it isn't finicky the way regular pinterest is on a mobile device. two thumbs up!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|While it took awhile to get into the book itself and go with the flow, I did and it was great.  I tried to stretch it out awhile because I didn't want to finish it.  I agree with others' views that the end came quickly but I liked the way she skipped to the future.  Great read.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love it. I use it every single day. Couldn't get any better! Don't know what I'd do with out it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is great!!!!! it word really well and there is no problems with it all. I think it is one of the most useful apps I have.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Great movie, but language was too rough and didn't need to be.  If they had cleaned up the verbage, I would have given it 5 stars.  Clooney gave a fantastic performance, and no, I am not an overzealous fan of his.  However, he deserves great credit on this flick.
1569242739|5.0|I decided to order this book after visiting a cupcake shop near my home boasting that they had vegan cupcakes.  The ad talked about their amazing array of flavors.  I was extremely disappointed when I got there to find out that not only were the vegan ones tiny compared to the regular ones, but they also only came in 4 flavors.  They also had only a few out at a time because they didn't want them to get crumbly so the rest were in their freezer... At $4.50 per tiny excuse for a cupcake, this was obscene.<br />This book makes that cupcake store look like a sham.  The cupcakes come out perfect and I am no master chef!  My favorites are the chocolate cherry ones, I used the chocolate mousse topping instead of the buttercream and they are truly delicious, I don't think I could buy ones this good.  I also love that I can substitute 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and stevia if I want to make them healthier or low cal, but the taste is fantastic.  I just ordered their other 2 dessert books which I'm sure will be just as amazing.  Their cookbooks are also equally easy to use and the foods come out delicious.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If this is what passes for a good book this day in age we have a very sad future. This book is nothing but someones journal entries. I could maybe be ok with that but it is just bad, passing it off as a \\"book\\" I am very angry for spending anything on it. I would love to have my money back, it seems like the author is sitting back and laughing like wow I can't believe these idiots are falling for this. Please don't buy it is really really horrible. If I could give negetive stars I would.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A must have. love it on my kindle fire! Puzzles are mind bending and fun. Stop reading this and buy it.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|I liked season 6, but season 5 was better. The religious thing killed the mood. I know that part of Dexter's charm as a killer is that he has a conscience(especially now that he is raising his child alone), even if he does not recognize it. I hope season 7 is better, now that Debra finally knows that Dexter is a killer. She cannot believe that this is his first killing with all the preparations and care he took.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|This is a fun strategy game. The campaign is more of a tutorial and you learn how all the pieces or units work.  But I wish the campaign had more of a narrative.  I would love to see special characters or units, different challenges.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I don't have a smart phone and this app has come in very handy when I am away from my computer especially if you just want to look up a contact or review what's been going on while you having lunch!
0156027321|4.0|The last fifty pages (and perhaps alternate ending ha ha) made and saved the book for me, though I might have gone in with much to high expectations given the fantastic reviews of this book. Great mix of religious and mystical (take a bow Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Paulo Coelho) writing, that is grounded by a gritty survival tale and observations in animal behavior. In the span of a couple pages Martel goes from writing near horror passages to painting emotional moodscapes or descriptive interactions between man and animal. Was never bored by this book, but also not as drawn in by it as I had hoped. Can understand why many think of it as a modern classic, worth anyone's time to read.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Living in the country makes us prone to power outages and my Kindle is always with me so it only made since to try this app.  I was very please to see how much LIGHT it really gives off.  I am very glad I put this one on my Kindle.
B003AJUHKQ|5.0|I'm typically not an anime fan.. so I really don't care too much for anime, but I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan, or a bit curious about anime itself. Ghost in the Shell got my attention with it's idea of cyborgs, and being a huge Metal Gear Solid fan, this seemed to have a small resemblance to some of the crazy weird things that happen in the MGS games. (Nanomachines anyone?) I was hoping the story would be complex and have alot of depth just like the MGS games as well, and even though the movie isn't much longer than 90 minutes.. it does a great job of throwing you in a whole new world, with depth, mystery and great personalities
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'm problem not in the age group this was written for but I LOVE THIS BOOK! My new favorite. Need tissues to read this and point of retreat! Well worth the tears!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't really know the premise of this book before I started reading it, but now that I do, I hope this book stays fiction! :) It was a really great read, and had a TON of detail. I have seen the movie now, and thought the book was amazing compared to the movie. The movie was ok, but so much of the detail gets into the book.
B007SGM084|5.0|Yes there is some talk of domination but it's sets up the background for mr. Grey . These books are mommys version cinderella in todays setting. Truly the most beautiful love story ever written on paper!  You won't reget it and you will need tissues!
B004QX07G4|5.0|OMG! I was looking for a quick read that I could pick up and put down whenever I felt like it.. I started reading this in the airport and was finished by the 2nd day! It is super funny, and if you are a TRUE Ellen fan you will love it!
B007TMON8M|4.0|This game is fun because it challenges that mind of all of us. The game does have 1 down side and 1 kink. The down side is that there are only 12 levels. The kink is that it force closes when you try to leave the game. It's best to just hit the home key when you want to get out of the game. The challenging part it getting 3 stars on all 12 levels. Take a look at my YouTube channel LtGhostVirus ... It's new and I will be showing video reviews on apps that come on Amazon free app of the day, and some other apps I find interesting. Hope to see some subscribers soon :-)
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|after all the hype, and not having read the book as a comparison, i was disappointed with this story. acting was ok for mostly a bunch of young actors. but the story lacked pop. and the romeo and juliet take off was just a bit too kitzche for me. I give it 3 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it was not 4 stars either.
B008XG1X18|4.0|how could mobile pintrest be a bad thing.  wish it loaded quicker at times but I think that has more to do with pintrest than the app itsrlf
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Simple and complex all at the same time, this game is a true gem.  The learning curve is just right.  If you liked Cut the Rope you should definitely give this a try.  Ohh yeah, I almost forgot to mention how lovely the music is.  Easy 5 out of 5.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I love this game, its so much better than the real USA sonic cd game, just cause the music fits much better than what we got for the sega cd, I never rite reviews really, but I would love too see alot more of old sega and sega cd and maybee couple 32x titles. I would like to say that this came from the hey day of video games and they really had to work to make them fun and engaging..

0812993292|5.0|I am a murder mystery reader.  I was out of books for my Kindle and decided that since I had a long plane flight ahead of me, to get something different.  This book was so delightful, sweet, full of wonder and transformation.  It held me captive the whole flight and I finished with tears as we landed.  Just a wonderful book and I recommend it highly.  Doesn't matter that it is situated in England.  The essence of Harold Fry and his wife exist everywhere.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|First I have to admit that this is my first romance type novel.  I usually read Louis L'Amour, Zane Grey, James Patterson, Dan Brown, Mitchum but not Sparks!  I decided to read this book because my wife rented the movie \\"The Notebook.\\"  I actually enjoyed that movie and wanted to investigate further about Nicholas Sparks.  I realize that this novel was somewhat similar to \\"Sleeping with The Enemy\\" but Sparks used a flowing character developement that keeps you intersted in the character, their thoughts and also the surroundings.<br />His writing style engages you to become part of the story.  You actually picture yourself in the town, with a birdseye view of the events and he absorbs you in his writing.  I would recommend this book even if you are not a romance reader or if this is your first romance novel.  Although there were no big surprises, I enjoyed the book and it kept me entertained.<br />Good Job Nicolas Sparks.
B0092MIHSY|2.0|After a few listens really disappointed, the lyrics still shine, but the music is way too samey and sad, the packaging on the physical CD is superb though, one of the first times I can remember the packaging outshines the product, sad fan
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest so being able to do it on my Kindle Fire.  spending. a lot of time on this app. glad that it finally came to kindle.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The main reason I read the HG trilogy is because I had seen \\"Winter's Bone\\" in theaters when it was first released, and I thought Jennifer Lawrence was an amazing actress. When I learned that she was going to play the lead in The Hunger Games, I knew I'd want to see the movie. Fortunately, I've enjoyed reading speculative fiction all of my life, so it was no stretch for me to read THG. I have a problem with the basic premise --  that a totalitarian government would be able to take its citizens' children away from them to fight in gladiatorial combat. I don't believe in real life that people would put up with it. There would surely have been a revolution long before 74 years of Hunger Games competition had passed. That said, I set aside my disbelief as best I could while reading the books and watching the movie. The books aren't literary fiction, but they were entertaining and interesting enough to keep me engaged, mostly to find out what happens to Katniss.<br /><br />I thought the movie was faithful enough to the first book in the series, and the video and audio quality of this Blu-Ray disc is excellent, about what I'd expect. All of the performances were very good, and, as I expected, Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding. She's one of the greatest young actresses of our time, and I'm sure she'll have a highly successful career. I wasn't crazy about the jerky, handheld camera movements, but I got used to it, and I understand the director's rationale for using it. Actually he explained it well in the disc's extras. I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of the movie, although I thought it felt at times as if they were trying to justify their creative choices to appease Hunger Games geeks. I know there were people who were frustrated at the various ways the movie didn't precisely follow the book, and who thought Jennifer Lawrence was a bad choice to play Katniss. I can't imagine another actress in the role of Katniss Everdeen.
B0056DC84M|5.0|The watch is really great, the material and color combination is simply excellent, look genial with casual wear and sport too I recommend
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I'm not a big fan of biographies but once I started reading this, I just coldn't stop.This book tells us the story behind the man who changed the tech world.Every chapter gives the readers an interesting insight about the life of steve jobs.The author did a great job in covering each important aspect of steve job's life. I recommend this to anyone who's interested to learn more about the man who saved apple.
B007TML4EI|5.0|This is a great game for people who like problem solving. I have played through many levels and find them enjoyablly challenging. There is a simple tutorial explaining the basics of the game. However, I found I did best with trial and error. (Just as I am sure most of you did in high school physics when asked to drop an egg.)  My favorite feature is the option for you can test your structure by placing bombs or pulling on beams to find weaknesses. My kids discovered the added bonus of being able to have a free for all and blow up your dummy with bombs or add extra dummies to blow up as well.<br /><br />You should try this game if you like giving your brain a little work out. It may be free today, but I would have gladly paid for this app.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love it a lot better than the first one. but the kindle fire really should get apps as soon as apple gets apps.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|The book starts with Rose working a shift at her local DMV when while dealing with a customer she has a vision of her death.  Up until this point Rose was the type of person who would do whatever people expected of her and was the perfect daughter to a mother who didn't appreciate just what a special thing she had in her daughter.  So finally when her Rose is at home and her mother is once again nasty with her, Rose has had it and she ends up having it out with her mother once and for all and she leaves for the library.  But not before a few nosy neighbors have overheard her having said argument with her mother.  On her way home from the library she ends up writing a list of things she'd like to experience before she dies as her visions usually come true.  Unfortunately when she makes it home, it's to discover her mother has been murdered.  And meanwhile the police are suspicious of her because of the argument she had earlier with her mother.<br />The rest of the book is spent with her worrying about her potential death, dealing with the death of her mother and her sister, meeting her next door neighbor all meanwhile trying to have the experiences/wishes that she put on her list of experiences she wants to have if her visions are true as it reveals that she only has a certain amount of days to accomplish everything she wanted to accomplish.  This was a real good book that had me cheering for the heroine who blossoms over the course of the book and she becomes the person she was capable and truly meant to be.  I'd be up to reading some more of her adventures in the future.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Thank goodness my Kindle Fire glows in the dark so that I can keep on reading The Litigators at night.  Wonderful cast of characters, as usual.  The opening chapters are what we would all like to do at work - run out that door and never return!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I've been wanting to see an on-stage production filmed like a movie for years! I've been to NY a few times to see the Phantom on stage and have all the movies made.<br /><br />But there's nothing like this production which is beautiful, artfully and carefully filmed with closeups, crispness, and clear sound. No graininess or fuzzy sound or jiggly camera shots.<br /><br />It's like actually being there in person, but your view is much better!<br /><br />At the end, I won't spoil it for you, but there is surprise after surprise of appearances, so don't turn the DVD off when the production is over!<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this DVD. I'm American but I applaude the British for their quality!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I adore Phillipa Gregory.  I really like her novels and have read almost all of them. She is a perfect example of how to make a dull subject like history fun.  She puts personality and life into the character through a great combination of fiction and fact.  This is the first one of her novels that I would rate less than 5 stars.  That is because the person of interest, the daughter of the Kingmaker, did not live a very long life full of intrigue. She was a pawn in her father's quest for the throne and more of a standby than player. However, Phillipa did a very good job with the history she had.  I would not bother to read it the second time, though.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|No Jason Bourne but I throughly enjoyed the movie just as I did with Bourne in it, Jeremy Renner filled his shoes nicely.<br /><br />Well done, I will be buying this blu-ray.

0525478817|3.0|I think John Green is a great person. He's funny and so thoughtful. But I get so frustrated by his book reviews! Before TFIOS even came out, the review page was injected with 5 stars and squeals of delight in the comments. It's just so disingenuous and frankly disrespectful to the integrity of the reviewing process. Even now that the book has come out, there's an intense inflation of 5 star reviews. I am glad John Green is so loved. I am glad John Green is getting people to read and think thoughtfully about literature. Nevertheless, I can not contain my annoyance: this book is over-rated.<br /><br />I remember hearing John Green mention that one criticism he gets a lot is that he's derivative of himself, and he didn't really think that was much of an insult. I thought, good, because that's exactly how I feel. Supposing John Green would wade through the 109384204 reviews on this site I wouldn't want to offend the guy.<br /><br />Really, man: awkward teen boy with odd quirk (featured alongside wacky best friend) falls for interesting yet elusive or otherwise unavailable girl. I honestly don't remember anything about An Abundance of Katherines except the main character's name was Colin and he was a prodigy. The only thing that distinguishes any of his main characters is their \\"quirk\\": quotes of dead people, etc.<br /><br />So needless to say, I was excited for the different-ness of the TFIOS premise. For that, it is my favorite of the John Green books. Still, as you can see from my rating, it was not perfect:<br /><br />1. Extremely flat characters. This was almost underlined in TFIOS, because in his previous books, the love interest was purposefully 2D, and of course many main characters feel flat. In TFIOS, the excuses ran out and it was just a series of characters distinguishable only in name.<br /><br />2. The over-injection of \\"like\\" into teen dialogue. Sure, a lot of what the kids say is unrealistic, but that is furthered by the saturation of the word \\"like.\\" NowI use like more than your average person, but this is borderline ridiculous. I understand maybe in the 90s or whenever John Green was a teenager maybe this is how kids talked. I don't think this holds true today.<br /><br />3. Storyline painfully predictable.<br /><br />4. Being repeatedly smacked over the head with the deeper meaning and take away messages. First it's hinted at and you get it, and you're like hey that's cool. Then it just keeps being shoved at you until you're told point-blank. Can we tone that down a few notches? I wanna read and find the symbolism and feel kinda smart for catching on, you know? It feels preachy. John Green is incredibly thoughtful and has some interesting perspectives that come off great in a 3 and a half minute video, but it's a bit much for a novel. If my memory serves me right, he may be getting better at this though.<br /><br />I think that's the crux of it really. John Green has an idea and he wants to give it to you and that's what his books are about. His characters are simply vessels to convey the message. To his credit, I think he tries to make his characters distinguishable (as seen by their interesting quirks), but it just doesn't make them feel real. We as readers want them to feel real. We want a story with an exciting plot. John Green wants to convey his thoughts on a certain idea through the medium of novel.<br /><br />John Green's characters do not inspire feelings or emotional connection; at best it is intellectual connection, but too obvious. You don't feel a fondness for them as you would the brazen Scout of To Kill a Mockingbird. Your heart does not rend in pity for them like poor Holden Caufield. Slaughterhouse Five for me was intellectually stimulating more than anything else, but since it was so intriguing and subtle I think that's what distinguishes it positively from John Green who has a very straight-forward and underlined POINT. I don't mean to sound pretentious with my references, but to me John Greenis much more comparable with those than Harry Potter or Hunger Games, you know? His inspiration and drive is idea rather than epic story.<br /><br />I don't know. I do know I can't really critique helpfully or intelligently. What I know is my gut reactions as a reader, how I feel. And I felt ok. Ok, it was kinda fun. It passed the time.<br /><br />What did I like about John Green's book? John Green does a fantastic job naming. Interesting-but-normal-but-have-purpose names. Also, I did like the thoughtful bits in his book, I just didn't like when it became way too apparent what he was trying to say.<br /><br />tl;dr: I recommend this book for a Saturday afternoon.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can't wait for the 2nd book to be released...very well written, and keeps ones interest through the whole story...leaves u salivating for more on Gideon.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|As a fan of the books, I liked that time and effort went into the making of this film. While I believe that it was well played out, I did miss some of the important dynamics which were key to the book (I.e. the political struggle between the Capital and the districts). However, I know that there are only so many hours available for one film, so I enjoyed what was presented. I would, and will, watch it again... Looking forward to the second movie.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Honestly, I'd give it 3.5 stars because it is better than any 3 star game (or mod in this case) but has a few too many issues to be a true 4 star game/mod.<br /><br />I love how people are whining that this is .99 cents for a copy of Where's My Water. What about the Cranky's levels they are just a level pack for the EXACT same game also for .99 cents?<br /><br />This is a level pack with totally modified story mechanics, a new look, and even some additional voice acting.<br /><br />It doesn't run nearly as smoothly on my HTC Evo 3D as WMW, which sort of bothers me and pushes it out of the solid 4 star rating in my book.
B0000507R0|5.0|I am not going to comment on the musical attributes of this iconic group.  They afforded me my introduction into the fabulous world of classical music.  Being a pianist myself, I can only describe them as \\"revelatory\\".  Rather I would like to comment on the audio emanating from 5.1 channels when listened to over a DVD Audio based system.  I use a Pioneer DV 79 AVi for this purpose (superb universal player).  Before I wax on dreamily about this mix let me first preface my statements with the fact that I am listening over four DefTech BP2001's, a 3000 center speaker and a balance of UIW's to culminate in a 7.2 surround system fed by thousands of super clean watts with five subs.  Now for the sound.  I have been to four ELP concerts and I swear.....i've never heard them like this.  Karnevil swirls around your head, just like it did at MSG!  But the real gem- man you've NEVER heard Lucky Man like this!  When Emerson hits those uber low Moog bass notes the whole darn house was shakin'!  AMAZING!  In a word, if you have the right equipment que this bad boy up and get ready for an accoustical feast.  HIGHLY recommended, if you can find one.
B003K16P50|1.0|This from my Goodreads review:<br />I guess this is why I find most British humor irritating! I got 53% and THAT was a struggle. I'm SO glad this was a library loan, all I lost was time!!!<br /><br />You could make a passable joke in a short story maybe, but 335 pages???

0060852712|1.0|I recently bought The Twits cd for my two young children to listen to. I received the item fairly promptly...the packaging was fine...the cd case was intact...only problem was no cd.

0307472590|5.0|Tras la lectura de La Sombra del Viento, qued&eacute; satisfecho por varias razones:<br /><br />1.) La narrativa es atrayente y no te deja solatar las p&aacute;ginas. Los pensamientos que los personajes tienen son profundos de naturaleza y provocan que uno se sumerja profundamente a la historia.<br /><br />2.) La trama es muy buena y no deja de sorprenderte las varias sorpresas dispersas a lo largo de la narrativa.<br /><br />3.) El desenlace es conmovedor y verdaderamente te deja deseando saber m&aacute;s de qu&eacute; suceder&aacute; posteriormente.<br /><br />4.) En conclusi&oacute;n, y por lo que puedo ver de los dem&aacute;s comentarios, es un libro que vale la pena leer.

1401322786|5.0|The Time Keeper is a fable about time and what it means in our lives. There was a time before clocks, before sundials, before we divided our days and our lives into measured divisions, yet we still felt that we needed more time--maybe not in hours and minutes but in moments. Mitch Albom's latest book follows the lives of three individuals who are all affected by time. The first is Dor, the now immortal inventor of the first time keeper who has become Father Time. He cannot escape the curse of his own immortality until he faces the cries of those most affected by his invention of time. He focuses on Victor--a wealthy and terminally ill man who wants to freeze his body so he can outlive death, so he can have more time to live--and Sarah, a suicidal teenager who is ready to take her own life because she can't live with the mistakes and torments of high school cruelty. The three stories are told in a series of fleeting moments that finally intersect and connect in an instant of frozen time. The story is mythical, lyrical and fleeting, like looking through a peephole into someone's life and seeing in a glimpse everything you need to know. I loved it. It reminded me of Albom's other works, particularly The Five People You Meet in Heaven, but even more than that it reminded me of one of my favourite books, Alan Lightman's Einstein's Dreams. It's lovely.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a digital galley of this book free from the publisher from NetGalley. I was not obliged to write a favourable review, or even any review at all. The opinions expressed are strictly my own.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|This CD is one of the best I've heard in a long time.  Every song sounds great and Easton's voice is amazing - reminds me of the old time country music.  I saw him perform live as an opening act for Brad Paisley and he was great in person too.
0345803485|3.0|Well, after all the hype I figured I had to at least read it for myself. First off, let me say that I had no interest in reading this book simply so I could decry it as poorly written or not as good as (insert whatever comparison here). I really hoped that I would like it. I really wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. I knew that it had taken the world by storm and started a frenzied mainstreaming of erotica for women, and for that I was willing to give it a chance. After all, it's a good thing that women are embracing their sexual desires in print, isn't it? Yes, sure. Or something.<br /><br />Besides, I had already read a parody (and listened to the audiobook), Fifty Shames of Earl Grey, and it was an absolute delight. It was silly and just sexy enough that I figured the real book would be, well, let's just say intriguing.<br /><br />The weird thing, though? I liked the parody better. It at least gave me permission to laugh at the more preposterous elements of the book, like how ridiculously naive the main female character is (it's not just that she's a sexual virgin, it's like she's a virgin of life) or how seriously the male character takes himself (All. The. Time.). Plus the book doesn't feel like a sub-dom story to me. I'm not expert, but the \\"dominance\\" aspect of Christian Grey feel so awkward and forced (not in a good way) and the \\"submission\\" of Ana Steele doesn't even seem to turn her on as much as it is a thing she puts up with because she really, really wants a boyfriend. The whole thing feels more petulant than sexual.<br /><br />So is it as good as people say? I don't know. I guess. I mean I've read a lot of the \\"if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey then you'll love this\\" books lately (publishers are throwing them at book bloggers faster than you can say \\"trendy\\") and Fifty Shades is better than most of those. But most of those are terrible.<br /><br />So is it as bad as people say? I don't know. I guess. I tried so hard not to be judgmental but I found myself wanting to yell at the book and say, \\"What are you even talking about? How is that sexy?\\" and even though I promised myself I wouldn't make comparisons I kept thinking, \\"This isn't as good as the movie Secretary with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.\\"<br /><br />My advice? Read Fifty Shades of Grey but maybe don't spend money on it. Borrow it from a friend or from your library. Then go watch Secretary.<br /><br />p.s. I deliberately did not compare it to the Twilight series which inspired it because I know virtually nothing about Twilight (not an easy feat in this day and age) other than the assessment of it from The Oatmeal titled \\"How Twilight Works.\\" You can check it out on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal.found myself wanting to yell at the book and say, \\"What are you even talking about?

B007PP2J9I|3.0|What makes Mark Russinovich's first book Zero Day fascinating is the realistic scenario of a computer attack, made uniquely possible by Mark's extensive computer expertise. The second book avoids delving into the details to the same extent, losing the main attraction and making the novice fiction writer's weaknesses more jarring. Much like Zero day, Trojan Horse suffers from improbable action and insufferably heavy-handed national stereotyping.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Whoa! Just when you think you know what's what and who's who...another twist. Well written, clever and an ending that you will be discussing with others.
034580404X|4.0|I have to admit I had goosebumps at the end of the last book.  Maybe I'm just getting sappy in my old age, but I do love a happy ending.....
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read a lot of fiction.  Gone Girl was so hyped before the release and seems to be selling very well.  I am unsure how I got through it.  The story plot line has been in todays news so it is a real topic fictionalized (I hope) - wife disappears - husband main suspect (look at those unrelated Petersons).  The book does switch between different time periods (I personally do not mind when an author does that as long as the transitions are smooth - I didn't like the tranistions in the book).  The case of the missing wife is built against the husband but I just wasn't buying it - it was piled on and on and got annoying.  I wasn't surprised with much of the story - it was predictable which not having read another book by this author, it shouldn't have been.  Another big problem I had with the book is I didn't like 1 single character, no one was sympathetic - they were mean, selfish, completely self-centered and completely unrelatable.  And the relationship between brother and sister was creepy.
030758836X|3.0|Well I must say I went online and bought this book because I thoutht it would contain something not explored before.  But the truth is, I figured out very early what was going on.... in the first third of the book.  When my theory was confirmed in the second half of the book, I felt kind of cheated, like, well, this has been done to death already.  That said, the book is very well written and the characters are nothing short of diabolical psychopaths.  I just wish I was a bit more surprised than I actually was.  The end was indeed a disappointment.  As if the author just ran out of steam and had to sum it all up somehow, and I actually lost a great deal of respect for the man, who I was rooting for.  My advice:  Wait till it is available at your local library.  Don't spend the money to get what you think will be a \\"big shock\\".  It's really not at all.  Most will figure out exactly what is going on early in the book.

B005H9B44A|5.0|I could not understand why women were recommending I see a movie that usually only comic books fans (mostly male) would be interested in seeing.  Once the movie began, I understood why.  The titular character is personified by handsome new \\"heartthrob\\" Chris Hemsworth, who turned in a fabulous performance, and no one else could ever be Thor after seeing Hemsworth in the role.  Tom Hiddleston was stellar as Loki, and Natalie Portman was perfect as Thor's love interest.  The story was well-written and memorable, and pacing was excellent.  It never dragged.  The special effects and costumes were impressive.  My husband, daughter, and son-in-law loved it, too.<br /><br />In the theater, we saw it in 2D.  We liked it enough to buy the DVD/3D Bluray combo pack.  We watched it in 3D on our Samsung SmartTV, and the 3D was so good that the movie was even more enjoyable.  It has not sat idle on our shelf, like other videos we've bought and had no interest in seeing after we'd watched it once.

This is the greatest public health disaster to befall us and has put doctors (like me) as the product of taking care of sick people that shouldn't be sick if they eat the right plant based foods.

I felt there were somethings I would have liked explained more and characters wrapped up. But all in all really liked this series.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I started off loving this book, but it gradually fizzled for me. What is thrilling in the beginning becomes predictable and dull by the end. Overall I'd say it was entertaining, but I'm not sure if I would read it again.
B001LA3LYU|3.0|Granted Jeff Beck is one of the best at his trade, but after a while I found a lot of his music to be a bit too simular.  I mean there's some great tunes here, but I con only listen to around five at a time before I move on
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This was the most affordable case for iphone 4s with good reviews. Personally, the \\"fancy\\" cases are not my taste. I figured, what the heck, I might as well give it a try for the price alone. Well, I have had my iphone since March 2012 and this case has not disappointed. The screen that was included has worked good too, very easy to put on. The case is simple yet sturdy. I am a clutz and have dropped it several times even on cement and the case still looks great and my phone has never gotten damaged. I have since ordered the amazon basics clear case too. Try it out and see for yourself!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the challenge it gives i play allllll the time addicting  i would definently recomend it absolutly nothing wrong with it get this app people!!!!! :D :D
0307454568|5.0|This first book of the trilogy is the best.  Best story, best introduction of an exciting character, fast-paced and entertaining as hell.  Recommend.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app was just what I was looking for. It lets you move delete copy paste and many other functions withought even having to plug it in to a computer!
0307949508|4.0|Excellent though not as good or as riveting as the first book of the trilogy.  The characters tend to wander and it's research heavy, but still packs a punch.  Recommended
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read The Hunger Games and then kept on and read the other 2 books in this series.  It is a captivating, well written novel that takes place in a certain version/vision of the US in the future.  Marvelously thought out characters and a fascinating story which I won't divulge.  As the title implies, even a 63 year old can love this book!
1463707606|5.0|An origami enthusiast always welcomes a book Meenakshi, her models are beautiful and not very complicated so anyone with little experience on modular origami can fold a bunch of nice pieces quick and easy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|didn't expect it but found this to be a well thought out and fun puzzle game give it a try
B003REEPJS|5.0|I love what Miley Cyrus does. I feel I always get one hundred percent from her performances. Never disappointed. I think she is a great entertainer.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the book ! Great love story ! Would recommend to anyone !  This book makes you fall in love with the characters, leaving you wanting more!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Happy to finally have this on my kindle fire! I've been having some force close issues, but I think its more of an internet connection issue than anything else. Works well for pinning, but would like to see the capability to edit boards and comments.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|this is a great app! I use it on my Kindle Fire. I use it a lot to save recipes and articles.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am a SERIOUS sleeper. This app is on my Sony Tablet and has become alarms #4 & #5 in my morning wake up ritual. It has a setting that makes you either answer a math problem or enter a one of those captcha things. Those settings are great & make me focus mentally & visually. Its still takes me 5 alarms to wake up, but this app is my final two & its great!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I received the product a day before scheduled much to my delight.  I had it assembled in no time thanks to the easy to follow instructions.  After testing it a few times, I got the hang of out and have started cutting bottles with ease.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Yes! If you're considering purchasing, just do it. If you like post apocalyptic stories, or even just amazing stories...this is a great buy! I read non stop and told everyone I know to buy and read it. You won't want to put it down, and you'll be recommending it to your friends  like me!
B0015HOFZI|2.0|Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. In all fairness I haven't isolated the problem to the unit or my laptop,the jury's still out.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is such a wonderful book, that when I finish reading it..... I miss it..<br /><br />I will recommend very much if you want to read something easy and beautiful...<br /><br />I do lots of researched and read very complicated books all the time .....so for a change it was great...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game it works great for the kindle fire. and its so nice how you have different games on it so your not stuck with the same game. so id recommend getting it its free and its soo worth it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|what else is there to say? it's pinterest. works great! this is a must have if you are addicted to pinterest!
B00884GR0W|1.0|this game Sucks so bad compared to minecraft I played it on my cousins kindle and I felt like I was going to throw up guys just go on 4shared.com create an account and get minecraft pe for free that easy
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I though that this book kept repeating anna steel's feelings to the point that it got boring.  I'm not sure if I want to purchase book #3
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Such an addictive series. Keeps you hooked from start to finish and leaves you wanting more! If you're looking for a book series to keep you busy, this is it. Highly recommended!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great to know exactly how much battery life is left for each function on my kindle fire!  I love it!
B008QDCZJ2|4.0|It's hard not to believe that this album would face immediate scrutiny like a firing squad.  While Elysium does not have the pumping beats that were present on its predecessor, Yes, Neil and Chris (along with perennial programmer/engineer Pete Gleadall and producer/musician Andrew Dawson) escaped to Los Angeles to make their first US recording.  It seems as though the location has infused the whole project with a sense of hope and reflection.  These ideologies are not always listed at the top of Pet Shop fan agendas (think 'dancing' and 'despair' with a bit of sex & money thrown in with humor), and while it may be shorter on the hedonistic approach, there is plenty of humor to go around.<br /><br />Please keep in mind Elysium can be hard to love on the first listen.  It is an album that reveals its treasures upon repeated listens in beautiful ways.  Opener \\"Leaving\\" and the following \\"Invisible\\" are perfect examples of a less-is-more approach, winding wistful melodies around aquatic synths and subtle beats.  It shows you don't always need everything and the kitchen sink to make a great record.<br /><br />Many complaints have been levelled against lead single \\"Winner\\", but rarely have PSB recorded a song so pure and direct in positive sentiment.  One could also interpret this song as being about love overcoming political obstacles, a topic close to their hearts, and a way of transforming the song into something greater than it reads on a page.  Other songs here like \\"Breathing Space\\", \\"Hold On\\" (a recessionary stage number--remember these are the guys who wrote a West End musical a few years back), and \\"Give It A Go\\" also have an uplifting and spacious charm--and the vocal tracks are amazingly warm sounding.<br /><br />While \\"Ego Music\\" is influenced by the celebrity culture this recording was surrounded by, \\"Your Early Stuff\\" is also tongue-in-cheek, with direct quotes from cab drivers as spoken to Neil used as lyrics.  This is followed by \\"A Face Like That\\", a songwhich represents their 'early stuff' more than anything else.  The banging rhythms and dark electro textures layered with sounds of thunder and other effects is an inspired moment, and may serve as a portal to future projects.<br /><br />The final quarter of Elysium is simply fantastic, beginning with \\"Memory of the Future\\", suffused with an incredible melodic hook, yearning lyrics, and darker synths--it's probably the closest thing to a late-period ABBA track here.  (It may also be my favorite song from Elysium, and could work well as a single with the right radio mix.)  \\"Everything Means Something\\" has been described in reviews here as 'plodding', but I think this song has incredible motion, with its shifting beats and analog-by-way-of-digital textures, as well as some of the deepest lyrics on the record.  It seems to carry a sort-of weighty Depeche Mode feel, while the tempo and thick keyboards echo the structure of DM's deep album tracks (plus I can just hear Dave Gahan singing something like this).  Things wrap up with the glorious \\"Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin\\", a disco song so un-disco you don't even realize it.  It would have been very easy to fall into camp territory a la \\"New York City Boy\\" with a song like this, but the arrangement shows restraint, and adds to the touching sentiment of the lyrics.  (Remember, again...these guys wrote a West End musical.)<br /><br />My verdict:  If you come to Elysium with expectations about how Pet Shop Boys should sound, you may be disappointed, but if you come with the sense that you may hear some of the most beautifully personal songs they've ever written, then you will likely leave satisfied.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This program is great. I like it because it is compatible with Microsoft Word and I can send my documents as attachments to my desktop for printing out.
B007NQVRNS|5.0|I always cry when I watch this movie.  First time ever hearing of Jim Caviezel and love Dennis Quaid.  The father and son bond is just wonderful.  The sci-fi element is really good.  Time travel is always appealing.  When this came out on blu ray I got it.  Wonderful movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a page turner for me and kept me interested right to the end.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending.
B002YDRA22|3.0|Enjoyed the movie but experienced problems throughout the film such has delays and freeze ups. This was unusual, generally no viewing issues.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE PLAYING SPIDER, I PLAY IT ON MY COMPUTER AND MY FIRE KINDLE!!!  IT HELPS RELAX ME AFTER A BUSY DAY WORKING AT BEING RETIRED!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|This works very well on the fire and pulls together great worldwide news in politics, economics, world events, technology and science, and human interest stories.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|if you are looking for a simple, easy to use calculator, then this is it!  I love how big the display is and how handy it is. I also like the memory and tip features.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I play on my Nexus 7 and i love it! Missions are addicting and it is jut all around awesome.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I never played the game but now I don't no wetherr or not to get it because no one reveiwed it so come on ppl
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't waste my time reading these types of books but everyone at work had been talking about it so I did.  I read it in 2 days. WOW! I could not the book down.  The characters just came to life, I had to keep reading.  I'm now on the book two and I'm loving it also. EL certainly has a way with words, I'd love to meet Mr. Grey!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|be prepared to relax. be careful about spending too much time enjoying the challenge. the music is as soothing as the quest for perfect levels.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game. if there were some category for extraordinarily awesome games, this deserves it. It is apparently simple; it is intellectually challenging. One can spend a good deal of time assessing the solutions to some of the problems the game delivers. The gratification when that quest is achieved is startlingly  grand! This is absorbing and requires not digital speed, though that is occasionally rewarded, but thoughtful consideration. The entertainment provided is subtly awesome. (this is what I wrote about the first iteration of the game : Quell. It holds as true for this.) (My partner got addicted last evening--and she is a trug, proud, Luddite who abhors anything 'conmputerish.)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this app for kindle fire, tested it by scrolling through pictures, searching and repinning pics, managing my page, closing the app and pinning from websites and my personal gallery...conclusion, AMAZING!  Worked perfectly, fast, no glitches encountered. l logged in using facebook because I can never remember my password and it was a smooth process. I Recommend it to all pinners!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is full of interesting details about a murder case. It's an easy read although lenghty. The characters and setting are perfectly described . This novel held my interest throughout and the court room goings on were fascinating.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers are fantastic. This is one of those rare albums that you can listen to for weeks and not realize you haven't been listening to anything else. They are just as good live. Love them!
B0058VW36U|5.0|its really fun it can be a little slow but not that bad but other than that super fun! its worth the dollor<br /><br />-CrimsonClaw
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I was intrigued about this series because EVERYONE was reading it.  I agree with some of the earlier reviews that it seems to have been written by a hormonal teenager that has limited writing skills. Reference the constant \\"murmuring\\"  and \\"lip biting\\". I also listened to co-workers who said that the second book was better.  To me it is just a re-run of the first book.  Only four days elapse and she is back with the sadistic Christian Grey.  I would have more respect for Anna if she let months or years go by, then run into him again under somewhat different circumstances.  Perhaps the rekindling of their flame would have been more believable.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I found it very repetitive and not very well written. I finished it because I wanted to see if they did anything but have sex.<br />It could have been a good story if it had  delved more into their minds and not their private parts
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Excelent book. This is a great start for an excelent series. Michael Scott is a pure master in the art of writing, I highly recommend this book
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very good basic calculator to have. A good app that is very handy to use. I use it often.
B007TML4EI|2.0|First off, on the Kindle Fire it takes a while to load and shows a blank screen during that time so I thought it was broken. Second, there is a tutorial showing you how the controls work, but no guide as to how to build the structures. I had no clue what size or shape of wall to make. I guess if you already know it could be fun, but I was just randomly drawing lines and that didn't work.
B007TML4EI|5.0|Played it for few minutes on my t mobile galaxy s ii phone and it was very smooth games. Obviously, there's a bug in the game when you play it on the kindel fire. And that what causing all the bad reviews.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Everything was awesome until about 11:00 PM with about twenty five minutes left in the movie.  At that point the streaming stopped cold and a call to Amazon the next day put the fault in their corner. They did not offer any kind of refund or extension of time for the video to be viewed so let the buyer beware. In Amazon's defense, this is the first problem I have encountered when streaming from them.<br /><br />I give the movie five stars and the viewing experience from Amazon zero stars since the movie stopped streaming. That explains my three star rating.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!! It is very addicting.  Includes over 300 levels! This game is definitely worth a purchase :)
B000SEJHRA|2.0|This is not a typical read for me. I'm reading this for my book club. I'm 30% thru don't know if I make the end. This book was a read for my book club. Think it should be a mans read.
B008ANFRG6|5.0|This is a great CD. Very diverse, but Steve Vai all the way. The bonus DVD is the best I have seen so far with any CD and makes the Deluxe edition a great value.
B00881VLCE|2.0|the app is constantly freezing on the screen. I tried 1 puzzle and spent way to long waiting for it to catch up. I'll keep looking for a puzzle app.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I love this movie..I read most of Burroughs' Mars books when I was a teenager and I hope they make more of them into movies. This version is so much better than the others, I guess we just had to wait for the RIGHT technology.  Best on a big screen.
B000V7O0IA|5.0|The Lake House is one of those romance movies that the two main characters yearn for each other but are unable to meet. It is one of those films that make you want those two characters find each other and be with one another. It stars Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. Shot almost entirely in the city of chicago, the film portrait a beautiful average city in america. It is absolutely beautiful from beginnig to end; plus the score by Paul Mccartney at the end credits make this film certainly memorable.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|It downloaded and installed quickly, but wouldn't do anything else.  I would think they'd want to have versions that work on more than just the latest hardware.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works just like it says it does. I personally enjoy it especially when it comes to calculating my bills and when I go grocery shopping.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|you have to get this app it is amazingly good it is so adicting if you get it you'll be happy
B006LSZECO|1.0|I felt ripped off at the end...  ...actually I was suspecting that I'd be ripped off somewhere about half through... by the storyline, yes, but especially by the fact that this author ripped me off of my precious time in reading the book!
B00169N0BK|5.0|After realizing that I needed a way to balance my PC monitor's color with my printer I started to investigate the ways to do this. It became evident that there were a number of ways to accomplish this many of which were quite expensive. Many companies offered separate products for both the monitor and the printer. As a result, the costs climbed with respect to the additional merchandise needed to be purchased.<br /><br />I then discovered the ColorMunki Photo. This device takes care of both issues as well as balancing your video projector and also your digital camera. The installation of the software was straightforward and easy. The usage of the device could not be more simple or foolproof. And as for the results, this device really works extremely well. The price is reasonable and the devices clearly made to last many years.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered the u s b on Wednesday and received it the next day I was able to put my vacation pictures on my Kindle and it made it easier to show people my pictures of Alaska
B0090EIILU|1.0|I loved Borat and rented this. Watched about a third and turned off. He has jumped the shark.spread the word!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my phone and on my kindle fire. I start my day by listening to the bible on my kindle and listen on my phone on my way to work. I love it and its a great way to start my day off.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and thought it did equal justice to the book. Looking forward to the rest of the movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The truth is 1 out of every 3 woman have had some negative sexual encounter. I never thought about how the same situation could affect men. This book has not only made me think, it is a book I couldn't put down and I was grumpy until I started book two. You know a book is good to mess with your emotions on such a basic level. Buy, read it, and make up your own mind. I LOVE THE BOOK!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I've tried several stands and this one is by far the most versatile. You can use it elevate your laptop on a desk, but you can also use it when you're sitting on a sofa or in a chair. Unlike other stands this one balances perfectly on your legs! It's also easy to take apart and fits into my laptop bag.<br /><br />This company also has great customer service: I broke the small plastic pieces that keep the laptop from sliding off and they promptly send several replacement ones free of charge.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was everything I wanted it to be. I couldn't put it down. I was extremely disappointed with the ending. It was like she was just DONE writing the book and decided to end it and didn't care about it. I was so invested in this book and was very mad it ended the way it did.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is definitely one the best movies ever.  A great adaptation of the book and superb acting!  A must own, a must watch, a must love!
0099579928|5.0|As an avid reader, it's been awhile since I've read a book that was so good, that I went back and read it over again.  I believe that E. L. James created characters who pulled me in.<br /><br />I am also not in love with books written in first person.  I usually avoid them.  Ana was lovely both inside and out.  In \\"Darker\\", she pulls Christian into the light.<br /><br />I only read reviews after I finished the books.  I wanted to form my own opinions.  The author wrote three successful books.  Yes, some of the dialogue was immature, however, so were Ana and Christian.  Any book that draws strong positive and negative opinions is successful.<br /><br />I will keep these books on my bookshelf forever.  They told a love story, and soothed my fragile heart.  I still want more of Ana and Christian.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie to others. It was historically accurate and such a great story. This is a must watch movie.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|great actions, and keeps you interested in show, even if it was made from a game I grew up playing.  Had alot of good actors also.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|I'm a huge Ewan McGregor fan and his performance did not disappoint. Emily Blunt also added depth to a character I probably would have hated had it been any other actress. But, the story could have pushed farther and ended up being too quaint.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|When im bored i play this app and i watch the battery go down ............i love this app .......i defanitly would download this app
B008ANFRGQ|2.0|Unfortunately seems like Steve Vai is now part of those guitar players that every album sounds just the same with some sporadic differences and new features but at the end is just he same old sound. The album is good, the songs are very good, there is not a bad song in this album, but as I just said if you have heard his previous instrumental albums you already heard this one; but go ahead and buy it, and listen to it while you practice some licks with your Vai signature Ibanez, but don't forget to take a break to clean that old Star Wars figure collection next to your bed.
1905236042|5.0|bought this for a friend's 3-year-old daughter who loves to do yoga with mommy.  she loved them! mommy did too!
B008XG1X18|4.0|very good,  other than once in a while getting hung up and pausing.  love being able to pin and add catagories.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Starts out easily enough, then becomes more difficult. Getting done with a perfect score gets harder.  Good game play, soothing music.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|Funny and well done, laugh out loud funny, I am going to try all his other books because I enjoyed this one so much.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|The Antec 302 case is roomy.<br />Installed a Gigabyte Z77M-D3H-MVP motherboard.<br />No problems encountered.<br />Appreciate having two USB 3.0 ports, a microphone and headphone jack high on the front of the case.
0525953728|4.0|This is a nice story. What made the biggest impact on me were three topics:<br />* The sacrifices made by the families of these soldiers. They are gone for months, their relatives do not know whether they are training in the US or tracking Bin Laden in Pakistan. Even when they are home, they are thinking about their next mission.<br />* The exasperation I perceived at the end with the politicians, who are sitting safely away and then try to use Osama's killing to get elected or re-elected.<br />* This soldier says he was worried about his family because there were too many leaks, and how everybody got it wrong. So he had to set the record straight. Would disinformation not have been safer than information on this case?
B004XANKVO|4.0|I bought this for my husband, who travels very frequently. He has a number of other backpacks, but since he got this, he has been using it. He likes it, especially the box where he can put his cell phone, glasses etc. I am happy with this purchase. It is a recent purchase, so I cannot comment on how long it will last, but so far so good.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love Criminal Minds and this season is no exception!<br />This seaon is full of twist and turns that will keep you watching till the end!
B0081L37Z0|3.0|...not what I was expecting. I avoided this when it came out because I thought, here we go again, jacking an old TV show.  This movie had me cracking up!! Worth the change to see it. The service is cool, I tried it before and will again.
B0030FUAKW|3.0|On overview, this 3 studio album collection by The Walker Brothers compiles the least necessary (and often avoidable) part of their career - their mid seventies reunion - and for several reasons.<br /><br />Firstly, their material became a downgrade from their sixties output. Not only did the Brothers turned 180 degrees from baroque pop melodramas to soft rock and blue-eyed soul, but also their material ceased to come from relevant sources. Whereas they were once top interpreters of American Brill Building material (Bacharach, Mann, Weil, Goffin, King etc) they turned their influences to the likes of Boz Scaggs and Elton John (the latter in style, not material).<br /><br />While there are noteworthy numbers here and there (the song \\"No Regrets\\" being their peak commercial track) fans will shy away from both Lines and No Regrets, possessing almost zero artistic value, until they reach Nite Flights, where Scott Walker shows off his very first self-penned numbers of his avant-garde reincarnation. And likewise it is hardly of any value to casual fans - if anything it will leave a bad first impression - which will be the case due to the budget price of this collection.<br /><br />Material-wise is nice to have these hard to find works on cd, and even better from the official Columbia sources, but it lacks any notes or booklets, replacing it for mini lp sleeves and nothing else. So AS A WHOLE 3 stars.
B00407PNY2|5.0|The DVD Bullit is a classic if your a 'Motor Head\\" then you simply must have it in your library, the car chase between the Mustang and Hemi near the end is AWESOME Hollywood at its best, picture quality and upscaling was pretty good, overall 10/10!<br />Doug.
B0090EIC3Y|2.0|All the humor was in trailer - nothing left in the movie.  I like Sacha Baron Cohen but this was his least funny movie!
1455502758|5.0|My review won't add much to the others except to say I agree!<br />So, let me state up front, I am not an atheist or a theist, or a writer but a non-denominational Christian.  I enjoyed Mortality, Hitchens final book and chapter of a brilliant mind even while at death's door. If one's life comes to an end while enduring the personal reactions to a slow demise, such as Christopher experienced, regardless of their intuitive knowledge of what life is about, the reflections will be the same for all.  I loved to witness his many debates challenging Christianity.  It is not at all unreasonable; to share many of Hichens same conclusions, as he so eloquently was able to bring them to the forefront. Especially, his ability to show religious faiths of all types, including Christianity, are in shambles with demagoguery, false traditions and unreasonable conclusions. Only a fool could entertain the thought that purity of truth had presented itself here on the earth.  My own conclusion is that this world ran by humans is for the most part in total confusion because of the exact intended purpose it was designed to convey. I have always counted on Mr. Hitchens keen eye and understanding to point out the contradictory nature and worthlessness of many human philosophies and endeavors, which he has always done with astute clarity. My faith has never been shaken by anyone's examination of life or the world, as we find it, because in the panorama of human existence, at the time of the accumulation of all knowledge, at the heavenly throne of judgment, Christopher Hitches will be our greatest spokesman, and we will all agree, that mankind is utterly incapable of ruling himself, without total guidance from the Creator God. Each one of us will have an easy decision before us, when we stand at that heavenly crossroad. I will miss your writings and debates, Christopher Hitchens; until we meet again at the crossroads of decision.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|They never lost the shock value in their line of comedy but still very much hilarious, in a way that doesn;t seem to get old.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm completely addicted to this app. . Don't know what I used to do with my time before I got this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest &amp; this app is better then the last one I was using... but it says ' force close ' too much. idk if its the app or if its just my kindle. other than that I haven't had any issues with it!
B0042O85ES|4.0|Terrific performance by the band at their peak, but it is so frustrating when the cameras stay on Mick Jagger during Keith's or Mick Taylor's guitar solos. Notice how the audience is rarely shown; When this movie originally came out in the theaters in the mid 70s, much hype was made that it was filmed in a way that would make you think YOU are the original audience witnessing the concert (Hence the lack of audience shots that would spoil this illusion).  Too Bad they went that direction in the editing room. It is always exciting to see Mick J. interact with the crowd, but there's NONE of that on display here.
B004JVZXXU|5.0|This movie was scarier than the first in my opinion.  The end was a shocker and extremely disturbing.  I can't wait to see the third installment of the series.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I appreciated the candor of John Locke, the author.<br /><br />Being involved with Internet Marketing, I understood the business model he chose and the superb  execution.<br /><br />The book was well written, including humor and very informative about his strategy and methods.<br /><br />If you're thinking of writing and selling your works on Kindle...this is a great read.<br /><br />It will save you money as you sort through and consider the many \\"Guru\\" options being offered every day.<br /><br />--Paul
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Though I have heard people say that the movie does'nt do the book justice, this was a great movie. I am also going to explore the claim that the movie does not compare to the book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This boom was awesome! The author kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole book. I think that everyone should read it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is as interesting as the first, just not as kinky, which is fine.  I've fallen in love with the characters, and I LOVE that I can download it onto my Kindle!
0783226063|3.0|There are tons of shortcomings to this release. The most obvious being the video quality.. the right side of the screen has a light blue tint in most scenes, and the left side (25% of the screen) has a dingy green hue.<br /><br />The audio quality is poor in certain scenes, such as the scene in Castle Caladan  between Lady Jessica and Rev Mohaim discussing the need to test Paul. Terrible sound quality.<br /><br />At least it is on a DVD.. so it will not corrupt as rapidly as my VHS version, but seriously, except for the widescreen formatting, the VHS version is better in every respect, even with the age of the tape approaching 25 yrs old this year.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|All I can say is that if you want a true chronograph on your watch get it else where. While Invicta does sell a true chrono speedway, it's a toss up if you're going to get one from Amazon or not.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this addicting game! it rocks I played it til my battery died and my kindle shut off! I looked for this game for months!
0525953728|1.0|Prior to the release of this book I wrote an article titled, The next Andy McNab. However, I defended the author wanting to give him a chance and referring to President Obama as Andy McNab since he is the one that used the killing of UBL for political gain. While I do not think there are secrets that could jeopardize future operations, I was right on my assessment that this author is the U.S. Andy McNab. This book is about him and is used for his advancement. It is poorly written and not a product I would expect to see from a SEAL. These guys are the best at what they do, professionally and personally. This product is at the 5th grade level and is not a reflection of SEAL work. Disappointing!!
B007TMON8M|5.0|I got this game while it was free and I've been playing it all day and night. Only wish is that it had more levels now I'm getting the dummy game like this one by the same guy -for free! Going to love it
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. I can watch this movie over and over again. This movie will make anybody want to be a seal just like shooter makes anybody want to be a sniper
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I am using this with my ipod classic, and a Bose blue toothed enabled portable speaker. It worked great right out of the box and has worked flawlessly for the last two months since I purchased it. Bear in mind that the your device has no ability to be charged while using this unit so it is strictly for short term use (as long as your device charge last). This is not a problem for me...But something to be aware of. Overall...Great product...Very happy.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Interesting, nice facts on area traveled, but \\"dragged through\\" some of the personal history. Very great descriptions of geography and other people.

B001IF277K|5.0|This battery works as advertised.  No issues at all.  The price is exceptional especially compared to what my service provide would charge.
B000069HZP|4.0|Bit of an oldie, so I think we have all watched it before. A rich man getting involved in a game, that has so many twists and turns, you can't work out how it is going to end. But I must admit you are not let down when the film does end. I like most of Michael Douglas films so this one is no exception, so I would certainly recomend this one.
B000UR9T82|3.0|So, I'll make this relatively brief:<br /><br />The movies themselves are great. No bones about it.<br /><br />However, the discs themselves leave a lot to be desired. It seems like the studio rushed this set into production and cheaped out on it. The first two movies have almost precisely zero special features. Completely barebones other than trailers for Ghost Rider & Surf's Up. Neither particularly interesting movies. The third movie has all the special features one would expect on a DVD or Blu-Ray release. But it hardly makes up for the utter lack of features on the first 2 discs of the series.<br /><br />Clearly, the studio has produces Blu-Rays with all the Special Features one would expect for Spiderman [[ASIN:B007L4HFDI 1]] and [[ASIN:B007L4HF74 2]] and [[ASIN:B007L4HET8 3]]. So, I really have no idea why the studio cheaped out on this set and didn't include all the discs with the special features that clearly EXIST. Perhaps they had excess stock of the \\"barebones\\" releases because they were crap and not selling so they wanted to get rid of them? I really don't know.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, this is not the \\"ultimate set\\" that any and every collector would be lusting after.<br /><br />In my opinion, I overpaid for this set, considering the total lack of features on 2/3 of the movies. And also considering I already own the special editions on DVD, which came with all the features you could ever want. I had hoped this would be an \\"upgrade.\\" However, it felt more like a downgrade on account of losing all the features, rather than an upgrade from getting better picture quality.<br /><br />I'd even go so far as to say anyone who wants all the features should boycott this release until the studio comes out with a TRUE \\"ultimate collection\\" making use of the 3 \\"complete\\" (read: feature-rich) sets. You'd probably be better off buying the 3 individual releases of parts 1, 2 & 3 listed above, rather than this somewhat pathetic \\"[in]complete\\" set.<br /><br />My hope is that by this set not sellign well, the studio will get the message and make the actual \\"ultimate edition\\" everyone wants. They clearly have the sets to do it. They just need to swap out which sets they include. Swap in the two sets with features in place of the two barebones sets. Problem solved...<br /><br />So, again, overall bottom line: good movies, bad features. Vote with your money. Buy the individual releases with the features rather than this collection without the features.pe is that by this set not sellign well, the studio will get the message and make the actual \\"ultimate edition\\" everyone wants.

B005HSL626|5.0|I love this simple game especially with it's simple layout and easy to understand rules. everyone is a ninja with this game!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book. So glad i chose this series. Looking for some others like it or by this writer. Really enjoyed them all
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Great motion picture.  A classic for all time.  Everyone should see it.  It was the first time my wife had ever seen a complete Bogie movie and she loved it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very exciting and exhilarating book. I recommend adults who are looking for constant action and romantic pleasure. Be careful, you will start falling for Mr. Grey!
B008XG1X18|2.0|Love the idea of this app. Forces close all of the time. So frustrating! Cant go five minutes w/out getting a not responding error.
B005C9YZKU|5.0|Perfect for the person who loves nature documentaries. Amazing narrating with even more amazing visuals and is easily the best I have seen. Not to mention this Limited Editions is pretty cool with its well built globe case and even has a Production number on it to show which one you got XXXXX/50,000 which makes if feel even more collectible! I would recommend this to anyone and it should be watched in blu-ray if possible.
B00884GR0W|5.0|get this app now. I meen it so cool you build stuff you fight evil monsters so get it! by
B008TRUDAS|5.0|i actually decided to read this book based on other reviews. i am so glad that i did because it was great. i truly could not put it down. as soon as i finished it i quickly started the follow up novel point of retreat. i laughed and i cried. colleen hoover does a wonderful job of making you care about and love the characters.
B000VWPX3G|5.0|I'm like Maya Angelou when it comes to Liquid Swords: thirteen tracks, and they are all my favorite.  I listened to the album last night with the intention of writing a review on here today.  Continuous play with no undesirable tracks to skip, no filler.  Like any Wu record of that era--some of the martial arts film sound clips attached to the top or end of songs can seem long or non sequitur.  Slow on the uptake, I learned from Wikipedia that \\"Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\\" is a backronym of \\"bible\\".<br /><br />As great as this record is, and all its acclamation considered, I take issue with this being regarded unofficially as a GZA/Genius solo album.  Nearly every cut but the title song is dominated by one other member or another from Wu-Tang Clan (e.g., Inspectah Deck, Killah Priest).  This is no more a GZA album than \\"Winter Warz\\" is a Ghostface Killah single.  Liquid Swords is a Killa Bee in Genius clothing.  Although it's definitely an upgrade from the poppy Father M.C. style \\"Words From The Genius\\" debut, I regard [[ASIN:B000VWU372 Beneath The Surface [Explicit]]] instead as GZA's sophomore solo record.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I highly recommend this album to those who satiate with lyrical content over smooth, rough beats.  I welcome new listeners to hip-hop music.  Dig for this record as a study and take from it a history lesson of the art form.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|This book is a whirlwind tour of html5, and does provide the reader with a general knowledge of some aspects of its capabilities.<br /><br />However, it is also, at its core, a philosophical article.  The author pontificates about making your work Creative Commons and so on throughout the book; while I don't entirely disagree with him, I found it to be too much spin and not enough content.
B008D28HYS|4.0|Absolutely fell in love with this game.  Unfortunately, on my HTC Vivid I eventually got to a level where the puzzles were so large (and the squares became so small) that they became hard to manage on a small phone screen.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Play is great ads r a pain .I still play anyway. Would like to put my scores up but I have not figured that out yet.
B001JFZ118|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Highlander is the story of Connor McCloud of the clan McCloud who is immortal and must battle other immortals until there is only one. His enemy is the evil power hungry Kurgen who is bent on killing all the immortals and winning the prize. The acting is great, I especially love Christopher Lambert as Connor and Clancy Brown made for one awesome villain as The Kurgen. The fight scenes are all epic and the scenes to the past are all meaningful and emotional as we see Connor's life and how he came to be where he is now. The DVD was great quality and played perfectly with no jumps or freezes. A great buy and a great movie for anyone a fan of the action/sci-fi genres.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|The sheer amount of sex was jut too much, very unrealistic.<br />Got bored and wanted more story. Definitely preferred the first book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is responsible for preserving my sanity during class.  Who would have guessed that throwing birds at pigs could be so much fun?
B00368PSN2|4.0|This is a great little film, with fine acting all around. Has enough of the sci-fi element to pull in folks like me, but mostly a toungue-in-cheek adventure movie that's just serious enough to not be ridiculous. The pulsing Moorwen was great, and while the movie was disjointed in the final act, I believe that was the result of poor editing and decisions by the production company, rather than the fault of the director, as everything flowed quite nicely at first. I've been a fan of Caviezel since Frequency, and his portrayal (which everyone seems to have forgotten!) of Edmond Dantes in \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" captured that character perfectly (Guy Pearce was perfect as well). Ron Perlman is always amazing, and it is upsetting to me that with a little more effort, this could have been a great film. Perlman was about the only saving grace in that Nicholas Cage crapfest \\"Season of the Witch\\", but it went into wide release. Why not Outlander, which is a far superior film? Just glad to see Caviezel's career turning back around with \\"Person of Interest\\".
B000SEGQNS|5.0|A relatively short book, it is a must-read for anyone related to ever making a web site - be it a customer, a designer,  HR/SEO person etc. And even if you're not related to website building in any way, but are just curious what makes a good website differ from a bad one - this is a must-read for you too.
B005LAJ1H2|2.0|Loved Broadwalk 1 so automatically ordered 2. My husband & I were disappointed.  Expect for a few exceptions, it was exactly like 1, even ending the exact same way.  Are we crazy?  We keep thinking we must have received the wrong season.

B008IJTFYW|3.0|I was looking for an app just like this with some mellow tunes and a timer for use during yoga, naps, etc. and for free it works.  My seven year old was very intrigued and was 'mixing' the sounds together himself to see what each sound produced individually and collectively.  But bedtime came and he put it down for the night; when I picked it up I found a chat window in the bottom of the app which had popped up, it said \\"HOT guy wants to chat\\".  Fortunately we have taken precautions within our network which stopped it from going anywhere IF my son clicked on it, but I was shocked still that it was even possible.  I think that parents should be advised clearly during installation if that possibility exists...with any app.  I did try to go into the settings to see if I could disable that feature but could not.  If the paid version does not have any ads you can probably avoid having this happen (since that is where the chat box came from), though I cannot say for sure.  I personally would not use the app enough to pay for it so I will just block my son's access in the future, along with all free apps!
B005LAIHGI|3.0|Sacha Baron Cohen's new comedy \\"The Dictator\\" is a string of hit-and-miss sketches strung together by a thin storyline about Admiral General Aladeen, \\"dictator\\" of a fictional North African country of Wadiya, secretly developing nuclear weapons. Like Borat and Brüno, two comic characters Sacha Baron Cohen created, Aladeen travels to USA, but what you will see is not British shock comic's risque stunt involving unsuspecting bystanders, but a more story-driven comedy with professional actors, while picking random targets.<br /><br />That does not mean \\"The Dictator\\" does not contain politically incorrect laughs. It does, and there are a lot of them, but for all these political and scatological jokes (and I find some of them pretty funny), somehow the \\"Borat\\" star has lost his edge. As one of the characters in the film says, he has become a \\"nice\\" person. Well, I mean, comparatively.<br /><br />In \\"The Dictator\\" sometimes it seems Sacha Baron Cohen wants his character to be liked by the audiences. \\"The Dictator\\" is clearly aimed for mainstream success, with supports from Anna Faris and Ben Kingsley, and cameo appearances of Megan Fox, John C. Reilly and Edward Norton. The film even includes a subplot about Aladeen falling in love with Anna Faris's activist Zoey. Their love story, for all the ridiculous and outrageous moments it provides, is too familiar.<br /><br />Where is Sacha Baron Cohen going? (After \\"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,\\" he will be seen in \\"Les Misérables,\\" directed by Tom Hooper of \\"The King's Speech\\" fame). Now that his face has got more recognizable, it is unlikely that he will repeat what did in \\"Borat.\\" Or will he? Whatever he does, he needs fresh ideas and a format effective for his comedic talent.
B008RTE066|5.0|I hope Amazon has the good sense to delete all 259 of the reviews for MMT.  This is a whole new fully restored box set. If it stinks reviewers will say so, but we don't want to read reviews with complaints of poor color and poor sound as we do for the movie that's no restored thinking it's about this new set.<br /><br />The new MMT is a brand new product and should have a whole new space fot it on Amazon.  Amazon rarely messes up, so let's hope they're saving a new space for when the Box Srt goes on sale next month.
B00316DDUE|5.0|Already a fan, this is the video that made me a Yanni devotee. Watching the musicians and singers, some of the best in the world, added so much to the experience, that I don't know if I can ever go back to just listening to his music. I have watched this DVD over and over again, and marvel each time at the skill of each artist as they add their talent to Yannis' creations. If you already like Yanni, and haven't seen this video, then this DVD is a \\"must see\\", if not also a \\"must have\\".
B004XGN8W4|5.0|The gaems g155 is the perfect way to carry your console. The screen is  very nice with brIght colours. The speakers are very loud and it has dual input for headphones. The only downside is the limited angle visibility of the screen and the lack of carrying straps. A bigger screen would have been nice too.
B007TML4EI|2.0|on the fire, this game sits on a black screen for about a min before it finally loads. when it does the developer asks you if you want to give them your email for updates. you click no and still get a pop up for one of their games regularly. the game itself runs okay for about 10 min blocks when it forces closed.
0802798225|3.0|After finally caving in and paying $9.99 for an ebook I purchased Perfect Chemistry by Simone Elkeles. I finally caved in after months and months of not purchasing it because of the high ratings the book has received.  I was left disappointed and wishing I had my $10 back!<br /><br />Okay, so the story is cute but VERY predictable. Main character is the perfect, blonde, cheer leader who dates the hot football stud. The bad boy is from the other side of the tracks that is in a gang. I felt Alex's character was under developed and not really a \\"bad boy\\". Yes he was in a gang but he also played by the rules and was a good student. I connected more with Brittany and wanting to learn about her family and her sister who needs special care. Her character was very interesting to read about and see her life is not as perfect as it appears to her peers at school.<br /><br />I did enjoy the big build up of the two main characters Alex & Brittany before they got together. Half the fun of reading a book is the sexual tension of the characters before they are together. I found the end of the book to be rushed. One paragraph you're at Halloween the next paragraph it is 3 months later. I enjoyed the Spanish in the book as well but wish there was some type of translation so I could understand what was being said. It was only words or short phrases but I had no idea what Alex and his friends were saying and found it to be annoying to read and I would have to look it up.<br /><br />I knew every turn of the story and was not surprised by a thing. Even though I am only giving Perfect Chemistry three stars, I found it cute, easy read, and would be the perfect read for a late teen. I don't think it is worth the $9.99 ebook price however.<br /><br />[...]

B00003CY0V|4.0|This is a high action movie with the some really good scenes that will capture your interest.  It has some faults but for the most part it is entertaining.  The movie starts in the middle of a massive standoff at a bank that is being robbed.  All of the bank's workers and customers are wired with vests of 20 pounds of C4 high explosives and containing large ball bearings weighing 15 pounds that are extremely dangerous.  One of the hostages is grabbed by the police and when they get her out of radio range the bomb explodes and it is a horrific scene.<br /><br />Meanwhile a flashback takes you to a scene where a key member of the criminal team is stopped at the airport as he is a known international hacker of computers.  They now need a replacement and they go after an unwilling man named Staley Jobson (Hugh Jackman).  They send Ginger (Halle Berry) to go pick him up. He refuses because if he even touches a computer he goes back to Leavenworth as he is on probation for hacking into the FBI computer systems......<br /><br />I liked this movie for entertainment as it is full of action and it has a twisting and intelligent plot.  The objective is not to rob the bank but to steal billions from the government.  I liked the flow of the movie and the film has a lot of top notch cast members that do a great job in playing their roles.  If you like action films then you should watch this movie.

B007TML4EI|5.0|This is a very good physics based game and I enjoyed playing it. It does contain internet access to take you to a leader board, to Amazon to see the other games of the developer and to allow you to email your blueprints to a friend. This really is an excellent game but it doesn't need the internet access for features that I don't care about. The game also asks if you want the developer to send you an email when he releases new games. You can select no if you are not interested. You also will get a pop up exclamation mark and when you touch it you get a promo ad for the game Simple Physics.<br /><br />I still gave it 5 stars for being a well-designed and challenging game that worked perfectly on my Kindle Fire. Since it saves your design data the game will become a memory hog as mine has already soared to 45.34MB and I am only 14 levels in. I can't imagine how big it will become in the end so you may want to keep an eye on the memory space on your device.<br /><br />Melvin, your crash dummy, is counting on you to create a protection for him so he doesn't get hurt. The plans show you the size of item to be built, the anchor points, the total budget and the cost spent so far. What you build has to be able to absorb the force of the object or deflect it to protect Melvin. There is a hammer on the top of the screen that shows you are in the building mode and if you touch it then it turns into an X that lets you remove beams you have put into your structure. There is also an undo button on the top of the screen. Keep your project under cost and the lower your cost for a design that works the higher the points you will receive.<br /><br />After you think your design is complete then you can press the play button on the upper RH of the screen and see if it works. Just remember, Melvin is pulling for you! Your construction can be knocked down but as long as Melvin is not hurt by the threat or by a flying beam then you succeeded. Anchor points are shown by there being small white squares on the stationary object that you are trying to build on. They provide added strength and stability.<br /><br />The game progressively gets harder as the threats become more complex and you may have more than one Melvin to protect. There are bombs, swinging sledge hammers, falling large rolling stones and basketball size hail just to name a few threats.

B009329ZF2|2.0|I imagine it gets exciting, great special effects, maybe even some character development and realism after the first 15 minutes, but that's when I turned it off. The back story of the irresponsible younger brother who gets the girl and has a love thing going on with her even as he continually embarrasses himself is just too dumb to watch. I wanted to see the big monsters and explosions, not the cliche \\"love\\" story that every movie of this type seems to have to squish into the plot. But I guess it sells.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Pretty good. Not great. If you like thinking games you will like this game. Its slow paced.  Works great on the kindle fire. My seven year old likes it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was nervous about reading this book afer all the hype. It was great! I immediately ordered the next two books and have all ready read them.
B007SGM084|5.0|When I first began reading these three books, I had a lot of catching up to do to learn what was going on with the Dom-Sub fixation.  Then the sex started and kept going and kept going and kept going, etc., until I literally started to just skim the sex parts - which is a first for me.  However, these books wouldn't let me go. The storyline and characters are magnificentally woven as to cause you to not want to put the book down.  I dare you to start reading it and not glance up at the clock.  Hours will have flown by while you were trapped in this amazing work of fiction.  These three books do not disappoint the reader.

B0053O89WY|1.0|This is Bizare. As long as you have a DVD player that plays all country codes, you can buy this product from Amazon UK for under $26 including postage from the UK!!!! And that is full price in the UK without the $13.49 that Amazon .com says you are saving on their $31.49 retail price! I think there is a rip off going on with US DVD prices. As for the product, great series, just gets better.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|This movie is hilarious! I usually don't laugh out loud during movies (even if I think they're funny) but I definitely did with this one. I love Jonah Hill and the actor choices in this movie where great. I had to own it.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I do not mean the greatest Batman movie ever, but possibly the greatest movie ever. Heath Ledger gave the single greatest performance in the history of a Batman movie....phenomenal!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Although poorly written I enjoyed reading the first book and looked forward to the other two. The second was more predictable and repetitive but tolerable. I skipped entire paragraphs and pages to get to the end of the third, which I should have stopped reading after the first page.<br /><br />Boring, unoriginal, in short don't waste your time or money.

B008OOYALE|4.0|The game is great! I love the way it is made! the only problem for me, is that you must pay the coins you earn to clear up the land to expand. this takes too much coins and time! Also, as you expand more, the cost to expand becomes way too much! lower the cost please!!!
B00003CXBH|2.0|This was advertised as a 2 disc set but only came with one. No biggie for me as the price was low but still, falsely advertised. Also, the lone disc was loose & floating in the case & was scratched. Still plays ok but who knows for how long

B008ODZEQ0|2.0|While the movie was wonderful, the streaming version from Amazon was unfortunately low quality. This made reading the subtitles very difficult.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This book is full of marvelous phrases. You could quote it forever. But the thing that stands out most of this quite-short book, is the voice of the narrator. Vonnegut shrewdly stands aside from the main narrative, even though ostensibly this is based on his experience of being a POW and the bombing of Dresden. But he just appears at the beginning and the end, kind of framing the narrative in which he uses an absurd character as his protagonist, only implying here and there that he, too, was standing next to him and living much of the same experiences.<br />The amazing thing is how he manages to make such an anti-war manifesto from a narrative that is so humane and touching, without feeling sorry for himself or pontifying. He uses the absurd to remark on the absurdity of it all, and focuses on both awful and beautiful moments to make it all the more poignant.<br />Another high point is his use of flashbacks and flashforwards as an actual plot point, making his character go back and forth in time, illuminating different aspects of his story so as not to focus solely on 'the bad parts'.<br />It's a solid, solid little book, one which leaves you thinking and feeling different while establishing a voice that makes it a very personal affair.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I liked this game a lot. I had to do a web search for hints a couple of times. I guess I just didn't have the patience to actually figure it out on my own. This was one of the first games I got in this genre, and I really enjoyed it. It was over pretty quickly. Felt like it could have had a bit more added to it, because felt short. I didn't feel ripped off or anything, just wished it had been longer. Fire Maple does a good job! Since finishing this game I have bought other games they have come out with and enjoyed them even more! Just buy it already, it's good.
B005PK553C|5.0|I love being able to see this show over and over again. I can just log into my amazon account at any time and watch any of the shows.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fire Maple did a great job with this game. It was a improvement from their previous release Grisly Manor. I had a great time playing through it. I really like this type of game, and this one really made me want to play straight through to the end. I only wish that these games could last longer. I tend to blow through them, because I can't put them down! And since there really is no replay-ability, I often am sad that the game is over so quickly. With that said, it is totally worth the $2 bucks. Go ahead and get this one, you won't regret it!
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|*CONTAINS SPOILERS*<br /><br />Maybe a kind soul can tell us what is so funny about this movie? We just don't get it and to be honest, we are probably some of the silliest, most easily entertained people you will meet! lol and I know people will say, \\"you're over analyzing a silly movie\\" I'm sure we are lol but it just doesn't make sense to us at all. Tonight a friend and I watched Puss in Boots because we've heard it was cute and it was on On-Demand for free. We both thought we would enjoy it because we enjoyed all the other Shrek movies. It started off ok but quickly devolved into innuendos, which I guess are the norm with children's movies now, but they included insinuations as to prison rape, sleeping around, suicide, and incest. Let us not forget that revenge was a dominating factor in this plot. (Not exactly great topics for kids, I don't think). Although most of it will go over the child's head, I still wouldn't let them watch this movie. They've warped some classic tales and by doing that it's kind of like they are promoting these things (at least to us anyway). It was very strange for a kids movie, if it were an adult cartoon type movie, I'd understand but a lot of the subplots/topics were very adult for a PG film. By the end of the movie, there were just some things didn't understand.<br /><br />1. Why were Puss & Humpty the only non-humans in the orphanage?<br />2. Why did Jack want to start a family with Jill when they are brother & sister?<br />3. Why were people working for Humpty, when he got out of prison, if he didn't have any money?<br />4. Why was the goose, from the beanstalk, a baby when it was an adult goose in original tale?<br />5. Why did Jack, from the beanstalk who was a boy when he traded for the beans, look to be in his 60's when he said he only got 8-10 years in prison?<br />6. Why when Humpty let go of the rope, to save the baby goose, did he crack open on a rock and and become a golden egg? and why did the mother goose pick him up andtake him with her when she left with her baby?
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This is a great story, a real page turner. An interesting twist on the historical, \\"What if something different had happened?\\" theme. Highly recommended - although make sure you have plenty of reading time because you won't be able to put the book down!
B008602KQI|4.0|I do not have much to say except that this is a great movie but it is missing a lot of the emotion and struggles the books had. I still think it's a great movie to watch. Also, this movie is in no way the same and \\"The Running Man\\" or \\"Battle Royale.\\" They may have similar ideas but they are not the same and this is no rip off.<br /><br />An apple and an orange are both fruit and stem off a tree but they are not alike in tastes or in texture or in color, etc. Just give it a chance. You won't regret it.

B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Campy;fun.  The plot is full of surprises, twists and turns.  The actors are fun to watch and seem to enjoy themselves.  Not to be taken seriously but a great guilty pleasure.
B0034G4P26|5.0|My wife and I saw The Pirates! Band of Misfits in the theater while most everyone else was watching the Avengers film. We absolutely loved it, as we have nearly all Aardman work, but realized that there were so many jokes crammed in around the corners that we knew we had to get it on disc to watch at home, where we could pause, rewind and read the backgrounds.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray disc is fine quality with excellent picture and sound. A huge number of (thankfully skippable) previews up front took some time to jump over. There's a \\"So You Want To Be a Pirate\\" short which, while fun, is not quite up to the level of the main film.  There's also a couple of \\"making of\\" documentaries that I have not watched yet.<br /><br />We had finished viewing the movie when my wife asked that we go through the credits slowly, as she thought the actor who voiced \\"Number Two\\" (aka \\"The Pirate with the Scarf\\") sounded a lot like the John Watson character on the PBS \\"Sherlock\\" series (which we had just watched an episode of before.)  Sure enough - both were Martin Freeman.<br /><br />One of the many things I like about The Pirates! and other Aardman films is that they are enjoyable on so many levels. Kids will laugh and be thrilled, and adults will laugh at jokes and situations the kids might miss. (For example, \\"The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate\\", who is a minor character but good for a couple of jokes along he way.)<br /><br />This packaging includes Blu-Ray and DVD discs and also a code for UltraViolet, allowing some limited online streaming of the movie.  The process for signing up for this was not only cumbersome, but the UltraViolet web site was dead for several days. Doesn't bode well....  While we saw the movie in 3D in the theater, I don't see that it really benefits from the 3D treatment at home. Curiously, if you do buy the 3D version, you don't get UltraViolet!
B008133MDK|5.0|I really enjoy this verison of Sherlock.  It is a must see even if you haven't read or watched other Sherlock series. I would recommend to anyone.
0525953728|5.0|If you're looking for a highly polished bit of fiction of fictionesque writing, you will find that this book doesn't meet your expectations. If you want to read a COMPLETELY credible account of what it's like to be a SEAL and to understand the mission to end the political career of UBL, you will join me in giving it five stars.<br /><br />I didn't buy this book. A buddy came by, handed it to me (new) and said that I needed to read it. I think that he was looking for my reaction to this candid non-fiction account. I'm no more qualified to review this book than anyone else is, but from my experience in life and so forth, I found that the work struck a familiar cord. I was never confronted with the \\"rod of power\\" but laughed out loud (LOL) when I read the author's account because similar pranks played by men cut from the same cloth flooded in and resonated [[ASIN:1449975852 White Powder: A novel of the CIA and the Secret War in Laos]].<br /><br />If you're a politically correct panzy who bristles over people doing what the SEALs and their brothers do in other parts of USGOV, you will not like this account. The author kept politics to a minimum even though the politicians slapped their backs and blurted secret information to the mainstream media, which subsequently distorted it to make the account more suitable to sell television time to advertisers and to their constituency among the 'progressive' segment of society.  If, on the other hand, you don't fit that description, you'll be happy that you bought the book - or buy two and give one to a friend.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005C53Z8M The Old Whore: A Novel of Cartel Wars (The Cartel Wars)]]
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|As an adult, I read and enjoyed immensely the Gregor series by Susan Collins. I did not read the book, but I'm guessing it's better. I found the movie just a bit trite. I know it's a young adult story, but so were her others which were quite good and not at all predictable.
B0058BI864|5.0|I only started watching The Big Bang Theory a couple months ago. I had seen previews for this series for several years but never got around to watching it. Then a friend told me that Steven Hawking was going to be on an episode of the fifth season I recorded it and after finally watching it I fell in love with the series. I bought four of the five series so far in HD in Amazon's Instant Video format. After convincing my wife to watch an episode she also fell in love with the series. I will be purchasing the fifth season shortly as we have almost completed the fourth season.<br /><br />I am amazed at the picture quality of Amazon's Instant Video format! The clarity is fantastic! So far I have purchased four seasons of The Big Bang Theory and the first season of House in HD. I have also bought a number of movies (which until recently could only be purchased in Standard Definition. While my preference is HD (I am a big Blu-Ray fan) the convenience of not having to go look for the disk and load it is great when you want to watch a movie for a while.

0307744434|5.0|\\"The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones.\\" -Tsukiko<br /><br />I adored this book. Morgenstern created a wonderful book. I found myself savoring every word and having to re-read passages just because of how beautifully written they were. The descriptions in this book were so grand that I could picture this circus in intricate detail. I will caution that the plot moves extremely slow, there are a lot of main characters, and everything is very descriptive. I only say this because for me these notes are POSITIVE and it worked, but for others it might make this a 'I hated it' book. I hope not. With that I would definitely recommend reading the first chapter and seeing what you think first. I personally fell in love right away and think others might too.<br /><br />I found that I was so captivated by the characters that I was still thinking about them even as I stepped away from the book. I loved Poppet and Widget.<br /><br />Make sure you try to pay attention to the dates as well as the characters, because the story jumps back and forth through history. I didn't realize this till half way through and had to stop to think about what/when things were happening.<br /><br />Again, highly recommend!

B005RUUUAI|4.0|This is a great series.  Really keeps your interest throughout and its tough to watch just one episode.  Most episodes end on a cliff hanger and having you quickly loading up the next episode.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of the zombie/horror genre or anyone who just enjoys good drama and dosn't mind a lot of graphic violence and gore.
0425263908|1.0|[[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]] I just finished reading \\"Bared To You\\" and the only reason I finished it was because I had spent money on it. The book was poorly written and lacked a lot to be desired. There is very little story line and a whole lot of sex with crudely choosen words. This book is definitely not another \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" under any circumstances.
B004LWZW6K|3.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"Piranha DD\\" (A Horror DVD review)...Pretty good.<br /><br />Become a fan of \\"The Lowedown\\" on Facebook!!!<br /><br />Genre: 6 Movie 3.5<br /><br />What's it about?<br />Having awoken from their spring break extravaganza at Lake Victoria, the swarm heads upstream where they look to make a meal out of Big Wet, a local water park where when it comes to fun, nobody does it wetter!<br /><br />What did I think?<br />It was Porky's with Piranhas in this feast of boobs and gore.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the first reboot.  Even the CGI of the first was ten times better...almost making this look cartoonish at points. They seemed focused on putting as much nudity as possible in this film. This is somewhat reminiscent of the campy horror films of the 80's, and is worth watching if you are a fan of that or want to see David Hasselhoff in his lifeguard uniform again.

By all accounts, Tom and Violet are destined for their happily ever after. However, this engaged couple just keep getting tripped up on the long walk down the aisle.<br /><br />What did I think?<br />I loved the beginning and the end, but in the middle was a lot of fluff and filler to make the audience feel as if this engagement...and movie...have gone on far too long.  As I was watching the film, I couldn't help but remember the romantic comedy that kept playing in \\"Friends with Benefits\\"; which has Jason Segel in it. I kept saying \\"Flapjack\\" all the way through.  It is worth renting if you can suffer through to the end...that was great!

The delicious Mr. Grey has you in the palm of his hands & caresses you as your reading his & Ana's story.  Could not see how they put up with each other at times as they constantly clash over everything from food to sex!! Would have loved to go deeper into Christian Grey's past but book 2 does so anyway.  Would recommend to anyone to read but the overuse of some lines over & over again can get a bit boring.

B001PJRAUS|2.0|Let me start off by saying I've never read Pride and Prejudice, nor really any literature written around this time. A travesty, I know, but the point is that the only exposure I've had to this world is one of the movie adaptions. I loved it, and so when I heard that there was a miniseries out about a modern girl switching places with Elizabeth, I was really excited to watch it. Obviously with a plot like this, things were not going to go the way of Austen's novel at all, but I was okay with that and prepared for it.<br /><br />Now, I'm not a purist of any fandom. I like different adaptions, theories behind a characters \\"real\\" motives, whatever (heck, bring on the fanfiction even). So I'll say that I'm okay with changing things--to a point. What Lost in Austen did to the characters in this world is just reprehensible. I understand that the world had to be expanded and different scenes would occur because of the main character, Amanda's, presence, but some of it was just so entirely unbelievable that I found myself actually getting angry. Some of these characters--which, I admit, I myself don't know very well--just seemed to be so far off from what I remembered them being, and even what they started off as in the beginning of the series!<br /><br />I think my biggest problem by far was the main character. I could not relate to her in ANY way other than the fact that I, too, would love to be transported into the world of my favorite book. She was rude, crass, refused for the longest time to try to fit in to the world around her, and bumbled around throughout the course of the series making everything and everyone around her infinitely more miserable. I know why she loved Darcy--she'd already decided she loved him from the start, despite hours of complaining about how awful he was--but I have absolutely NO idea why Darcy loved her. It honestly seemed to come out of nowhere and felt really forced.<br /><br />Mr. Darcy was horribly cruel and stubborn, Amanda was vulgar and intent on doing the exact opposite of what was considered \\"proper\\", Bingley was pathetic, and every other character just completely unrecognizable after awhile. Amanda literally made everyone's life worse until--magically--everything was fixed right at the end to give that happy ending. The show was painful, uncomfortable, and tiresome. I gave it two stars because there were a few redeeming scenes and laughs, and the acting was actually fairly good. It was a really intriguing, wonderful idea, but the execution was just awful. Perhaps this is a bit harsh, but I was so excited to watch this and ended up only being frustrated and bitterly disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The fifty shades of grey trilogy was the most wonderfully obscene series I have read in quite a long time. It defiantly made you blush and it gave a person back there romantic years.

I managed to finish it, but it was a struggle.  I will not be reading the rest in the series.<br /><br />If you like to read interesting, well-written books that have good character development and an interesting story to be told, this is not the book for you.  Truth be told, even the sex in the book was lackluster.  The whole thing just fell flat.  I don't know why it got so much attention.
B001X0ZKM4|3.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BATMAN (1989) AND BATMAN RETURNS.<br /><br />Note: I saw this film with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />In my reviews of Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, I blasted Batman and Batman Returns for not having cohesive storylines, and wavering too much between comedy & drama. I have since viewed Batman Begins, The Dark Knight & The Dark Knight Rises. I had previously seen both films in the Christopher Nolan saga, but I saw them in preparation for The Dark Knight Rises. My expectations were almost blown out of the water with the final installment in the epic rebirth of The Dark Knight legend as told by Mr. Nolan. I recently decided to give Batman Returns a second viewing to see if my opinion of the film would change with another showing, as it did with Lawrence Of Arabia, Gladiator & The Phantom Of The Opera (1989), though in the case of the latter, my previous enthusiasm turned to downright revulsion and pure disgust.<br /><br />I digress, however.<br /><br />I just saw Batman Returns with XFinity On Demand, and I amend my earlier criticism of both films not having coherent storylines; however, my view on the latter remains for both movies. I have no desire to see Batman (1989) again, having viewed the climactic scene online and seeing Batman kill, among other things.<br /><br />I still digress.<br /><br />Batman Returns has a good story; however, the film wavers between a comedy and a serious drama. In addition, there is some sexual innuendo (including some very risque lines from Penguin), a mild love scene between Bruce and Selina, a nearly risque bit with Selina & Bruce at the masquerade ball & a scene where Catwoman licks Batman. Were those bits neccessary in a movie based on a comic book? So not appropriate for children, hence the PG-13 rating, but those parts really pushed the film to a borderline R rating. The violence seemed almost cartoonish in some spots and could have garnered the film a PG rating; however, there were some other some violent parts (including Max killing Selina, Penguin shooting a henchman in cold blood & Catwoman killing Max, among other violent scenes) which were too intense for a PG-13 movie aimed primarily at children. Again, the intense violence in several scenes and sexual innuendo pushed the film from a PG-13 to a borderline R, in my opinion.<br /><br />So much for the content issues. Now, on to the acting.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is too wimpy-looking to be believable as Batman. Batman is supposed to be somewhat muscular (I've never read the comics, so this is merely my perception of Batman) As Bruce Wayne, he's okay. Christian Bale IS Bruce Wayne & Batman, in my opinion. Michelle Phieffer was competent as Selina Kyle and somewhat captivating as Catwoman, though too sexual for a film whose target audience is children. Anne Hathaway nailed it as Selina Kyle (she is never referred to as Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises, and with good reason). Danny DeVito was acceptable as Penguin (though too scary for children), and Academy Award winner Christopher Walken oozed pure menace and vulnerability as Max Schreck (incidentally, that is the name of the actor who played Dracula in the silent film classic Nosferatu). The actors did the best they could with the script given them; ultimately, it was a mixed bag, with Ms. Phieffer, Mr. DeVito & Mr. Walken giving the best performances in the film. I'm very happy that Mr. Nolan did not choose Penguin as a villain for his Dark Knight Trilogy. Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger were wasted in a pre-opening credits scene. Gordon and Alfred were so underused in all four movies. However, that grievous error would be rectified in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Plus, a minor plot point in this film would be used to maximum effect in Batman Begins.<br /><br />The main themes  composed for this film by Danny Elfman (reprise of the Main Theme from Batman & Birth Of A Penguin)are good, but nowhere near as good as Hans Zimmer's superior scores for Batman Begins, The Dark Knight & The Dark Knight Rises. Mr. Zimmer's scores just SCREAM, Batman. Elfman's score merely half-barks, Batman. I'll take Mr. Zimmer over Mr. Elfman any day (in terms of Batman themes). Good song during the scene at the masquerade while Bruce & Selina are dancing, as well.<br /><br />Rated PG-13, but borderlines a hard R due to the sexual innuendo and intense violence in some scenes., The Dark Knight & The Dark Knight Rises. Mr. Zimmer's scores just SCREAM, Batman. Elfman's score merely half-barks, Batman. I'll take Mr. Zimmer over Mr. Elfman any day (in terms of Batman themes).

B006LSZECO|3.0|Great story. The author gets you hooked on the characters, and it's an easy thrilling read. However, that all gets robbed from you at the end. You feel as though Flynn couldn't think of a decent ending so she did the next best thing. Reminds me of the last episode of the Sopranos. Blah.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest but the apps tend to crash on both my kindle and iphone.  I have much better luck on my computer.  perhaps they need another developer for their apps.
B008XG1X18|5.0|finally!  This app makes it so much easier to navigate, pin &amp; organize boards on the kindle. The ONLY bad thing is that it enables us addicts! Would highly recommend this app.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I loved this book, I want to take this opportunity to thank Bryan Peterson for writing such an easy to understand book, I'm sure that from now on and with a little bit of practice my pictures will improve a great deal!!<br />Great book!! I would definitely recommend it!!
B001B7CNY2|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie, but the sound and picture quality is so great that I watched it and enjoyed it as if it were the first time viewing it. Definitely a great addition to my movie collection.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Over the past months I have read several books written by ex-SEALs because I became curious as to what makes these men tick.  Why do they do what they do? And the answers are there when they talk about \\"work\\" and what it takes to be a SEAL and describing missions they had been on.  This book is no different from the others I have read where a SEAL describes his job, other than the fact that that Geronimo was a high valued target (HVT).  IMO, other books gave more detail and info (which one can assume got the OK from the government to be published) than the author did about his experience.  Further to my opinion, our government and the media have also contributed to releasing information that should have remained classified. Although the authors real identify is not classified info, Fox News outted him and put a target on his back, along with his family. I just finished watching clips by the Discovery Channel about the killing of UBL [...] made long before the release of the book.  One can only wonder if these clips were passed by government for clearance.  Those interviewed confirmed what the author wrote about the mission, with room for error/omission as they weren't actually there.  In couple of instances they reveal more than the author did.    This book did not match up to the other books I have read, but it was still a fairly interesting read.  Since the release of the info that SEALs were involved in the UBL mission, SEALs have become a subject of interest.  These elite warriors lived in the shadows and now the mysteries that surround them are coming to light.  The author isn't the first nor will he be the last to continue to reveal this elite group of warriors.    Some things should remain a secret, but I blame the government and media for the leaks and exposure of sensitive information that can harm our country and/or military - either active or retired.  Every time sensitive information is released it is educating the enemy.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I first viewed this movie on Netflix.  I purchased the movie for myself at Christmas time but wound up giving it as a gift because I knew the person I was giving it to would love it as I did.  I wanted the Blu-ray version of this movie because I loved the presentation of Superman/Batman Public Enemies in Blu-ray format.  Batman Under the Red Hood did not disappoint.  The presentations as well as the extras were superb.  The voice acting, story, and animation are fantastic.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. was excellent for this part. This is my kind of movie. Very fast paced with great effects, mystery and intelligence. I will tell many people of this movie and the prices and delivery with Amazon.

B006YZOXHQ|3.0|What can anyone say about Barbarella that hasn't been said before. It's a bucket list must see (and Jane Fonda never looked better than in Barbarella), but...<br /><br />As a Blu-ray,this is on my list of the worst rendered Blu-ray's EVER! The transfer to Blu-ray looks worse than watching this on DVD. Really! It has this strange speckled iridescent appearance even in fully-lighted scenes, nothing like the \\"old film scratch and nick\\" problem, it's something different. This was shot with bright and exaggerated colors like 1980's Flash Gordon or the cartoonish Speed Racer of 2008 . This is probably the 4th or 5th Blu-ray I have with this problem, which seems to plague older movies more. And it doesn't matter \\"what brand\\" of TV & Blu-ray player is used to play it (I tried it on both Samsung/Samsung and Sony/Sony combos). Why would any studio produce such a poorly rendered Blu-ray? Don't they review these things?<br /><br />If it weren't for that fact that this is a classic, it would have received a rating of 2 or less. It's THAT annoying!
B001P5VT5O|5.0|ORIGINAL ALBUM CLASSICS is a great 5-CD boxed set containing all five albums that the Allman Brothers Band did for Epic in the 90s. The best thing about it is that the long-out-of-print SHADES OF TWO WORLDS is included. The CDs have also been given the remastering treatment that they deserve, just like their 70s counterparts. You should buy this set after you buy the first five albums and ENLIGHTENED ROGUES.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|They want 20 words but I need only three, I want More!  Others have summarized it well, so I will refrain.  \\"Wool\\" may be classified as science fiction, but don't let that put you off.  The story almost feels like a detective novel with its trail of clues spooling out for the reader and character simultaneously.  This was a very satisfying read.

B0031RAOW8|4.0|Great movie all around! Based on a true story.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic...as far as the dogs are concerned. I cannot imagine what took to have the dogs play the role of Hachi and go through all the emotions. Some of the work is explained in the extras. Make sure you watch the extras AFTER you watch the movie. Richard Gere is OK but because of his previous roles and his usual mediocre acting (when was the last time that Richard Gere got an award for his acting?) it is hard to imagine him in this role of a dog lover/owner who suddenly carries a ball in his mouth to teach the dog how to fetch. And of course he is a music teacher, not a stock broker from New Jersey or an agricultural scientist like the real owner of Hachi. That is the reason for the four stars. Bruce Willis, Bobby DeNiro or Chuck Norris would be a more credible choice for this type of movie. Especially since it doesn't require much acting since the principal character of the movie is Hachi (the dog). The real Hachi died in 1935 in Japan and his owner, who died from a hemorrhagic stroke in 1925 while lecturing, was an agricultural scientist (not a ...music teacher) at the Imperial University in Tokyo. But of course for a Swedish liberal director/producer who directed all promotional films for the group ABBA, a music teacher is better, more classy(?), and doesn't have dirt on his hands. And of course he is playing the piano! That is exactly why Richard Gere was a poor choice. Don't you hate when liberal directors (mostly from Hollywood) take the freedom to change a true story? This is NOT fiction people, it should be left as is!<br /><br />Simple story, very complicated emotions. A professor adopts a puppy in spite of the complaining of his wife (I think his wife is not represented well by Joan Allen who is quite cold and emotionless throughout the movie). It happens to be a very smart dog that has a huge bonding with his owner and waits for him every day at the train station. When the owner dies suddenly, it keeps coming back at the train station every day for nine years to wait for him. The last third part of the movie (the better part of the movie less people more Hachi) follows the dog's life after the owner dies.<br /><br />Very well done and you will definitely get emotional because of the behavior of Hachi. As a dog lover/owner myself I can tell you that a dog is by far worth any human friend you can have. If you like Richard Gere you will give it five stars if not, don't worry the dogs are making up for the bad choice of the supporting cast.s suddenly, it keeps coming back at the train station every day for nine years to wait for him.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|t's been a while since I read a full length novel in three hours. I do NOT agree with the science as presented at the end of this book, but the story is brilliantly and effectively told, so I decide not to care.<br /><br />Secret service agent Ethan Burke arrives in the town of Wayward Pines looking for two lost agents. Coming into town he suffers a terrible car accident that leaves him wounded and disoriented. He repeatedly leaves hospital and is equally often forced to return. He doesn't have his wallet, his badge, his ID or phone and none of his calls to the outside seem to go through. Something is off. When Ethan tries to escape town, the sheriff shows up. Besides, there doesn't seem to be a way out. So what, exactly, is going on?<br /><br />This novel was compulsive reading. Confusing, scary and disorienting, particularly in the middle. It is difficult to know to what extent Ethan might be crazy - or not. I did not see the ending coming. I was totally and utterly blindsided, although I have often read this type of book, and seen this type of movie. The writing is excellent and the human factors touching.

0545123275|4.0|My Feelings:<br /><br />So this is one of those books that left me gasping for air from the way the story was crafted so breathlessly.  Ms. Stiefvater is a true storyteller in every sense of the word.<br />I first fell in love with this book on the cover alone a while back.  I love how we are gazing into the forest, through the brambles and wispy branches, to find a solitary wolf staring back at us.  I love love love the blue tints and it automatically makes me think of winter.  And of course, the only other color is the spot of red which looks closely similar to a drop of blood.<br /><br />Alright, I know you guys are telling me to get on with it but I just really loved this cover as well as the others in the series.<br />The theme is a well known element: werewolf, but Stiefvater takes this and puts a very unique twist on it creating something completely different and very compelling.<br />Our wolves in this story are more dependent upon the seasons and temperatures than the moon.<br /><br />Ms. Stiefvater crafts a wonderful tale full of emotion that just spills out everywhere.  And then we have poetry...ahh poetry.  I love poetry and I love how much research she did to find poems that fit Sam and Grace so well.  You can really tell that our author went all the way out with the research on wolves as far as pack structure.  I just cannot get enough of the whole \\"Alpha-beta-omega\\" tier that goes with these pristine creatures.<br />Shiver is a slow paced novel that doesn't rush into anything. It takes its time but that is the beauty in the story.  When I was reading it, I didn't want to rush through the story (even though I only took 2 days reading it) but instead I wanted to enjoy each and every descriptive scene.  I have never been a fan of snow and winter but after reading this novel, I wanted to go wander in a snow filled forest just to hear the crunch of the packed snow under my feet!<br /><br />The characters in Shiver are complex in every sense of the word. Sam is so hurt, so fragile and yet I can't help but feeling he is more than what he seems.  I love the fact that Sam doesn't take anything for granted.  He looks at life in a very special sweet way that will make you appreciate the simple things that surround us.<br />His HEA, Grace, is the opposite of Sam but his perfect match too.  I guess it is true that opposites attract because these two seem like they were meant for each other.  She is the realist in the relationship and operates on the facts that are presented to her.  This makes it even more interesting for us to see how she processes the fact that Sam is the wolf that saved her so long ago too.  She feels connected to the pack of wolves that live in the woods behind her home.  My most favorite trait of Grace?  Her loyalty to those she cares about.  She will be loyal to the very end, even if it is a losing battle.<br /><br />I really liked the other characters in this book too.  I loved Beck, even though I wasn't sure how to feel about him through some of his more questionable acts.<br />I really enjoyed getting to know the other pack members through Sam's memories.  That made me feel even worse for Sam.  Bless his heart!<br />  Grace's friends are okay but I couldn't really feel any kind of relation to them.<br />Her parents actually just ticked me off!  As a mom myself, I felt like her parents were just out of everything.  I am not sure if this lack of parenting is a foreshadowing of events coming up or more of an explanation as to why Grace becomes such a strong female at a very young age.<br />The antagonists will definitely surprise you.  Sometimes the ones that start out as \\"the bad guy\\" will make you stand up and applaud.<br /><br />Was there parts that I felt were a little to emo-isque even for me?  Yeah there was times I thought Sam did wallow in self pity but after you figure out what he went through; hey I can understand why he has so much doubt.<br /><br />All in all, Shiver brought a lot of emotion out of me and there were times I couldn't help but cry and gasp at the situations these troubled characters have to go through in their life.  Yeah there is parts that tend to drag a little but the climax is so strong my heart still flutters thinking about it.<br /><br />I gave Shiver four hearts!n out of me and there were times I couldn't help but cry and gasp at the situations these troubled characters have to go through in their life.  Yeah there is parts that tend to drag a little but the climax is so strong my heart still flutters thinking about it.<br /><br />I gave Shiver four hearts!
B006YTYIXG|3.0|It's good, but not one of their best, or should I say, HIS best. Not too happy at all.  I pre-ordered it, but when I put it on, was let down.  It seems like it was hurried, and not a lot of effort came through.  It's still better than anything on the radio, but don't set your sights too high.  That said, I will still continue to support Max, and what ever project he's doing!  Sepultura will always have a preferred place in my library, and memory!!

B0095R64AO|3.0|One of the funniest scenes I have seen in a movie was the following (please don't read further if you don't want to know)<br /><br />Emily Blunt's character and her sister having a serious conversation about relationships in Elmo and Cookie Monster voices. Pure comedic genius.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was just ok. Some scenes were very contrived and cheesy. I'm a big fan of Jason Segel, but I think he could have chosen another lead actor who would've have more chemistry with Emily Blunt and was more in shape.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Movie felt more like a play.  Ms Roberts seemed to play the character very big.  But I have watched everything she has ever done and I still love happy endings.
B002YVAT72|4.0|It is great to be finally getting my records on Ipod, but there is one problem that is VERY frustrating.  After the record is done, a pop-up comes up for you to type in the album name and track names.  It doesn't save until that is done.  Sometimes, for no apparent reason, the pop-up just goes away while you're typing and there is nothing you can do but start the whole album again.  Forty-five minutes down the tubes.  I thought maybe it was because I had other programs running so I made sure to stop doing that and it still happens: no warnings, and no way to predict it or stop it.  The pop-up just disappears!  I've done 12 albums so far but I've probably done 6 of them twice (One took me four tries before I was able to get it all typed in).  Other than that it's working great.

0670022411|4.0|A Discovery of Witches is an interesting mix of paranormal, romance, mystery, history and science. Not very many books can pull off incorporating so many diverse elements in one package but in this instance it works. This novel is well-rounded and a great read, no matter what your preferred genre is. It does get a little heavy at times though so it's best to take your time and to stretch it out over several days. I'm grateful for the experience and in no way regret reading this book but after finishing it I'm more than happy to follow it up with something that's a little more light and trivial.<br /><br />This book reminded me a bit of some of Dan Brown's books, without the vampires and witches of course. It covers alchemy, Darwin's theory of evolution, quotes from well-known philosophers and more but with a supernatural twist. These elements brought me back to my studying days. Which was a good thing because I enjoyed the ties to the real world but also a bad thing because at times my brain felt overloaded. I read to escape the real world and this book just made me think way too much sometimes. I had to put it down and walk away because I felt a headache brewing. I enjoyed the history aspect of it more so than the scientific one. I've always liked historical novels and this book explores the past through Matthew's personal experiences. He's a 1,500 plus year old vamp who met many of the world's greatest minds in person. Hearing about his versions of Darwin and Newton really brought these figures to life. Granted, it's all fiction but it definitely makes history fun!<br /><br />Another aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was the inclusion of books. Whenever I encounter a main character in a story who shares my love of reading I immediately feel a connection to them. In this instance it's approached differently but still holds its appeal. Diana is a scholar and as a result she studies a wide range of books. Many of them old, or first editions, or famous. In one chapter she's exploring Matthew's ancient library searching for a Bible to use as a reference book only to stumble upon an original Gutenberg. I'm not a collector but even I can appreciate the significance of this and I wouldn't say no to an opportunity to see one.<br /><br />Diana and Matthew are great characters and I enjoyed learning more about what makes them tick. Many of the secondary characters in this novel also found a place in my heart. I can honestly say that I liked everyone in this book, even the bad guys. They all had a role to play in the story and if any of them wouldn't have been included I think the plot would have suffered as a result. This novel has so many moving parts that it can get overwhelming at times so don't expect to finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />This book was outside of my usual reading habits and a welcome change. The vast scope of what it covers is mind boggling. I really enjoyed the way that the paranormal and scientific elements ran side-by-side and at times became intertwined. I've never encountered such a \\"smart\\" supernatural book. However, it is very long and can be frustrating at times so you might want to read it alongside a lighter read to break things up. I really enjoyed A Discovery of Witches but I'm looking forward to reading some chick lit next before my brain overheats.chapter she's exploring Matthew's ancient library searching for a Bible to use as a reference book only to stumble upon an original Gutenberg.

B00028HBKC|5.0|I'm posting this review due to encountering - often - criticisms of The Passion that occur in books published 8 years after its release.  Most of these are, oddly, Christian books, which accuse the movie of being \\"too violent\\" and making God look \\"sadistic.\\"  Those accusations from unbelievers are understandable, but coming from Christians, they are bizarre.<br /><br />First of all, this is the first movie - ever - to show crucifixion in all its nastiness.  If you read the Gospels, you know they don't provide details: simply \\"They crucified him.\\" The Gospels' original readers would've known just how horrible it was to die on a cross, suffering unfathomable pain before finally expiring.  Movies like The Greatest Story Ever Told or King of Kings are good, in their way, but frankly we don't see any real pain - more like Jesus feeling a pebble in his sandals.  Lots of paintings from the Middle Ages and Renaissance do capture some of what Jesus actually endured, but Gibson in fact did the world a great service by showing just how gory it was.  By the way, some reviewers - both Christian and not - condemned Passion's violence but (inconsistently) praised the \\"realistic\\" violence of movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.  Quentin Tarantino gets praised as an \\"artist\\" when he uses graphic violence, but Gibson, who made it clear he had a motive other than profit, got raked over the coal's for making a too-violent movie.<br /><br />I should mention here that, to my chagrin, lots of very devout Christians I know have avoided seeing this, and the usual excuse is \\"I heard it's too violent.\\"  With all respect, that is the point: I can guarantee that seeing this movie will forever affect how you read the Bible and how hymns that refer to \\"the cross\\" take on a richer meaning.  There is a surplus of feel-good religion around, and Gibson's movie is a necessary counter-weight to all the fluff.  As I scroll through some Amazon reviews by people who say they are Christians but found the movie too violent, I'm wondering if the really saw it.  Everyone I know, personally, who saw it had a very different reaction - not \\"Ooh, that was SO violent!\\" but \\"Now I understand what Jesus went through!\\"  And for the people who said they liked the movie but said \\"Not for kids!\\" I respectfully disagree.  Kids, judging from their movies and video games, have a pretty high tolerance for violence, probably more than we adults do.  I think Christians would do their kids a disservice by keeping them away from this movie, which shows what REAL violence is like - not cartoon fun, but thoroughly nasty.  I think any kid who has seen this movie might feel a bit of emotion the next time he sings \\"Jesus Love Me.\\"<br /><br />I own the DVD of this movie and watch it every few months.  My TV can't quite duplicate the experience of first seeing it in a theatre in 2004.  I remember, about three minutes into the film, thinking \\"He's filmed this like a horror movie - and for once the horror isn't an alien, vampire, werewolf, or serial killer - the horror is human evil, destroying a totally innocent man in brutal fashion. It's the one horror movie every Christian ought to see.\\"  People are so accustomed to crosses as wall decorations or as jewelry that they forget there was nothing visually appealing about a real cross.<br /><br />Jim Caviezel, who played Jesus, was probably the best screen Jesus ever.  Granted, in some scenes the make-up seems to be more prominent than the man under it, but considering what Jesus endured, the make-up was hardly \\"over the top.\\"  Based on my reading of the Gospels, I think Pilate in the movie is a bit too warm-hearted - but perhaps that was the point.  If Pilate was shown as a thoroughly nasty character, his condemnation of Jesus would have seemed in keeping with his personality.  But the movie depicts him in a good light, as a fair-minded sort - and so it seems all the more horrible when he caves in to the mob and orders Jesus crucified.  The fellow playing Judas was superb - just the right guilty look, and, in the end, torn to pieces by what he has done.  The priests are shown as bad characters - which they were - and yet Gibson allowed them to show just a sliver of emotion when they see Jesus on the cross, as if they're not absolutely certain they've done the right thing.  They are not cardboard villains but, rather, human beings who have committed an atrocity.  My favorite character, aside from Jesus, was Simon of Cyrene, the bystander who gets forced into carrying Jesus' cross and, as they progress toward Golgotha, finding himself more and more sympathetic with this bleeding, mangled victim of injustice.<br /><br />Using subtitles was a great idea. I've always thought that actors' accents create a problem in biblical movies - The Last Temptation of Christ being the textbook case.  Having heard these characters speaking the actual languages of biblical times could have alienated audiences, but in fact did not.  I think it added to the feel of this being a documentary.  Wisely, the credits run at the end of the movie, not the beginning.  Gibson knew how to set the mood.<br /><br />Regarding the end: I don't think it could have been done better.  As a Christian (one whose life has been, to put it mildly, a cesspool since this movie was released), Gibson had to follow the crucifixion with the resurrection.  But he shows us as little as possible - all to the good, since the Gospels tell us very little about how it actually occurred.  Having sat through the horror  - I recall a lot of sniffing in the theatre - the payoff, as in the Gospels, is that God raises up Jesus to new life.  We see the risen Jesus just a few seconds, but it's enough - the \\"happy ending\\" that is part of the gospel.<br /><br />In regard to the accusation of \\"anti-Semitism\\":  that charge has been thrown at every Jesus movie since Cecil B. DeMille made King of Kings back in 1927.  Frankly, I just don't see how anyone can believe that showing a group of Jewish priests in 1st-century Palestine as villains is going to make people today rush out and do nasty things to Jews.  And I'm sure anyone who has seen the movie knows, the most brutal of the characters are the Romans.<br /><br />In short, if you haven't seen this, do - especially if you consider yourself a Christian but were put off by the \\"Too violent!\\" mantra.  Yeah, it's violent - like real crucifixions.  If you really believe \\"Christ died for me,\\" take a cold hard look at just what that meant.

B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a classic game with a twist.  I played the black and white and it was fun, and with the color the pictures come more to life.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good information that is needed when writing the book that you want to have put on a Kindle.  Easy instructions  and you can format Microsoft Word before you actually start writing your book.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|This season Started out a little slow but the season finale is the best yet! Now I can't wait for seaon 7 to begin.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is such an awesome app! It can guess everyone I think of correctly as long I put in the accurate information. Great break from doing homework =)
030758836X|3.0|One of the most enjoyable summer reads I've had in a while and by far the best \\"mystery\\" novel.  When I first read reviews, I thought the basic premise  sounded like a crappy, late night cable-TV plot, so I was thrilled to be up at 2am trying to will myself to stop reading.  An ambitious premise;  a possible missing/murdered woman's \\"story\\" told in alternating chapters from the husband's and wife's points of view, the reader is led along a merry trail of red herrings.  Even when I thought I'd figured out the plot (how wrong I was),  the writing was so perceptive and the characters so much more strange and bitter than they first appear, it wouldn't have mattered if the story went nowhere at all. But it did, and I wouldn't spoil it for anyone - just read it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app works really great it tells the truth I know because I downloaded 5 battery apps and 4 of them was the same as this on but there was 1 I knew this would work so I incourage people get this. app be because. it work really good lik I explained at the top of this review and bye
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it is a good app works well it it is correct I recommend this app I is helpful to keep track ot your battery
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok...but games are very similar...different graphics but repetitive platforms.  entertaining but hard to play for any length of time. token price to unlock games is high when games are all too similar.
B004LWZW8S|3.0|I found this movie entertaining. I mainly wanted to see Henry Cavill's role in it. I liked the story line.
B007TML4EI|4.0|Dummy Defense is a great way to exercise your creative Building Skills while Strategizing based in REAL PHYSICS.  Build structures any way you wish to PROTECT MELVIN (the Dummy) from any harm.  Keep material cost down to get better scores or Stars.  You Test your structures and can play the motion to see results.  If Melvin survives, you win.  The playback can be set to show Stress areas so you can improve it.  Controls work well and there is NO TIME LIMITS.  Enjoyable leisure play.  Sadly, there is NO Sound of any kind.  Sound Effects could enhance this greatly.  Nice to be able to recreate your structure as many times as you want and then alter it to save on costs and get more Stars.  Physics are not perfect but reasonably realistic to make it Fun and Challenging for most people.  Plenty of interesting levels with unique features like BOMBS, Crushing devices, Rolling Boulders, Recessed pits, etc.  You also protect Melvin and Blow up Kelvin (the sacrifice Dummy) at same time (ha-ha).<br /><br />Overall, a Fun and Challenging experience that let's you Plan, Build and Test structures you create any way you desire at a leisurely pace.  Thankfully, it is SAFE with No Malware, Intrusive Addons or annoyances or any kind.  You can also play with WiFi OFF.  Seems like the Network Permission is only or Score Leaderboards only if you opt to access them.  Well designed game but No Sounds.  I recommend it highly.
B007TML4EI|5.0|A+++ Fun Game to play. Very addictive. Soon will be one of the top games if more levels are added. Please add more levels!!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|the app freezes a lot and is slow most of the time.  the other app I had worked better than this one.
B000BNI99K|5.0|Never would have thought Rod Stewart was capable of doing this kind of music so well. This music at this price is an incredible deal.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you love 50 shades of gray you will love this book!<br /><br />This book brings you to your knees wanting and hopeing for more. I read it in just under 5 hours last night and am wanting more now!<br /><br />The start of the book isnt what you expect, it took me about 3 chapters to finally get hooked but once I was I couldnt put the book down. Would recomend this book to all of my friends.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's been a long time since I wrote book reviews and there are many good 5 star reviews which will tell you what the book is about.  I wanted to say that I really, really enjoyed reading this book.  I felt it was well written, the story flowed smoothly and kept my interest to the very end.  Please read \\"No Easy Day\\" without preconceived ideas or attitudes and learn from one of America's finest warriors.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|game is fun just dont like you gotta pay real money for some things. other than that its good. gg
B0067EKY7M|1.0|A rarity these days.  A widely-touted film that fails on almost every count: Plot, characters, acting, historical/social veracity, and others too numerous to mention.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Lots of different challenges & different abilities for your character.  Many hours of fun to be had playing this game.
044661758X|5.0|I have to admit that I don't read a lot of detective novels. But I definitely want to spend more time with Hieronymus \\"Harry\\" Bosch!  Loved this book! I like that fact that it is set back in the day before cell phones and when people smoked in their offices and conference rooms--just about everywhere. Mind you I am not a smoker and frankly it drives me crazy when people smoke around me, but there's something about the whole gritty old-school police detective vibe that gets me.<br /><br />I really like Harry. He is a hard-hitting detective out to get the bad guys and is not above bending the rules to do it. Yet Connelly allows us glimpses into the heart and soul of the man behind the shield. It's those moments when the reader gets inside Harry's heart and head that make me like him--when the reader is privy to his doubts and vulnerabilities, and yet on the outside he is unable or unwilling to communicate these thoughts and feelings. It had me thinking, \\"Oh, Harry.\\"<br /><br />The particular case that Harry is working on in this novel is intriguing. It is connected to a case that Harry worked on four years previously and is currently being tried for in civil court by the widow of the murderer.  There are several twists and a few surprises. The story moves along at a good pace and provides plenty of action and suspense.<br /><br />In addition to working the case and being on trial, Harry has a developing relationship with a school teacher, Sylvia. This relationship has its own complexities, but they are good for each other. I found myself rooting for them despite the obstacles. It is during these scenes in the book when I found myself saying \\"Oh, Harry\\" the most!<br /><br />After I finished the book, I looked for more books featuring Harry Bosch, police detective. I found several. And I also found that this book is actually the third in the series. So I added the first two, The Black Echo and The Black Ice, to my TBR pile. If you like detective novels, pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.. You won't be disappointed.
B004NS710C|5.0|I have read the other reviews of this film. Some don't like it. BUT----<br />I think it is a GREAT action film that moves along nicely. Nothing I saw in the film seems \\"phony\\" or overdone.<br />This is the kind of film that will bring the excitement to your eyes that make your eyes look \\"damp\\". I don't mean the \\"girly\\" kind of damp. I mean the exciting-rooting for the hero kind!<br />I recommend \\"Unstoppable\\" highly for a good action/human drama film that will let you escape the hum-drum for it's entire running time!!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Sorry didn't like this. It really wasn't the game I was looking for therefore i took it off my device.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Amazing insight, this guy is screwed though. It's only ok for the white house to leak this kind of info... Way more detail than other books written by seals. Did not know that US drones track running insurgents with IR lasers that can be seen by our ground troops through their NVG's.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel.  It made me think back to the way that it was in the 50's and 60's.  Even though I went through them, it impressed me how much things have changed. My sister, who works at a library, read this book and told me to read it.  I tried it and agree with her.  It is interesting and worth reading.  It wasn't gory like some of Steven King's books.
B006LSZECO|4.0|YOU HAVE TO KEEP READING! Don't just make assumptions in the beginning and give up on the book. I'm still unsure what rating to give it, because I keep swaying back and forth on some things. Firstly, the book put me off with Part One, because of the stereotypical characterization of a mundane marriage, and Amy got on my nerves. Well, Part Two totally changed all that, I mean, Amy still got on my nerves, but for totally different reasons. Finishing Part Three just rounded out everything and made me hate everyone in the book, haha. The ending was unexpected, yet anticlimactic. Everything was twisting one way, then arching another before fracturing, breaking and resetting wrong; I love that. This is a true blue psychological suspense thriller. It brought out some of the same feelings I had while reading Stephen King's Rose Madder. I can totally see myself reading more of Gillian Flynn's works, just to take another dip in her fantastical psychological killer of a mind.<br /><br />First Line: \\"When I think of my wife. I always think of her head.\\"<br />Last Line: \\"I think I've earned that.\\"<br />--------<br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"6-0-0. It felt different. I rarely woke at such a rounded time. I was a man of jagged rising: 8:43, 11:51, 9:26. My life was alarmless.\\" (3)<br /><br />\\"There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.\\" (7)<br /><br />\\"He promised to take care of me, and yet I feel afraid. I feel like something is going wrong, very wrong, and that it will get even worse. I don't feel like Nick's wife. I don't feel like a person at all: I am something to be loaded and unloaded, like a sofa or a cuckoo clock. I am something to be tossed into a junkyard, thrown into the river, if necessary.\\" (102)<br /><br />\\"Now let me string still more clich&eacute;s together for your amusement: It happened gradually. I never meant to hurt anyone. I got in deeper than I thought I would. But it was more than a fling. It was more than an ego boost.\\" (145)<br /><br />\\"We pretend to be in love, and we do the things we like to do when we're in love, and it feel almost like love sometimes, because we are so perfectly putting ourselves through the paces. Reviving the muscle memory of early romance.\\" (404))<br /><br />\\"We pretend to be in love, and we do the things we like to do when we're in love, and it feel almost like love sometimes, because we are so perfectly putting ourselves through the paces. Reviving the muscle memory of early romance.\\" (404)
B007KZY1YY|3.0|This book was too heavy on the sadistic details of the developing relationship and too thin on other aspects of the unfolding  story. The story line was much too simple.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|a great game for those that like to keep their mind sharp!  you can pass the levels by solving the puzzles and you can challenge yourself until you complete them perfectly. great game to drive an a typer crazy!!!
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I'm so glad he made this album in a year from the last year. I went to his concert last summer and bought his previous album at the concert. I just love his music and especially all the song in this album are super awesome!!
B005EGXTEE|3.0|I did enjoy the hunger games trilogy. The tale was compelling and the characters were well formed. However, the writing style was rather distracting.  I described to a friend that it read as if written by a teenager. Having said this, the charalcter of Katniss is sixteen/seventeen and the book is written from her perspective so in reflection this may have been the intention. I found the first book to be the best and the second similar but a little too much the same.  I was disappointed that the last book dragged towards the middle but the conclusion was satisfying and wrapped up the story nicely. This isn't a particularly deep read but it shines a light on our current culture and the dark turn our fascination with reality entertainment could take in a dystopian future.  Something to think about.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Doesn't seek to reinvent the wheel, a fairly standard turn-based strategy game, but nicely implemented. My only complaint is that the unit design seems rather heavily \\"borrowed\\" from the Starcraft games. Still, in all, an enjoyable game.
0385737955|5.0|I have really gotten into Dystopian novels recently and I love this book. It is up there with The Hunger Games Trilogy. I am really excited to read the second two books because I want to know what comes between that connection. This book was also reminiscent of Lord of the Flies.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My son is 20 months old and I downloaded this app as an attempted alternative to his pacifier. Not only did he fall asleep without the binky (and hasn't used it since) but I dozed off peacefully myself. Love this app :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this book hard to put down as it was hard to predict what was happening next;  unbelievable end.
B0011Z77OK|4.0|The music from Red Hot Chili Peppers is absolutely hott, awesome, and classic for years to come.  The greatest hits album is a gift to the accolades of great music this band has accomplished in their career.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run,its one of my favorite game its fun and cool. and I like the diffirences people that we get to buy.
B008602KQI|1.0|I hate hate hate this movie. I am going to throw it away because I don't even want it in my home.
B00881VLCE|5.0|It could be better... It still a lot of fun though. Helps pass the time when I'm bored or have nothing to do.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely the best of the three!!!! Cant put it down once you start reading!!!!  Hoping there is a movie, but just cant imagine how it could ever compare to the book!!!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Deleting it today. I don't see what's the big deal. I respect others opinions, everybody is different. But its not fun for me. It was so annoying you become obsessed and eventually have a nervous breakdown because the pig wont die.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After all my friends read this and couldnt stop talking about about it, I decided to purchase it for my kindle and absolutely loved it, couldnt put it down!!
B00004XPPK|5.0|A must see movie time and time again.Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford times less,you would not think you are watching movie that was made in 1946.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good, sad that it ended, but so happy the way it did, most def there were some tears brought to my eyes, sad that I am done reading!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|with over 140 different games - this app is the best. nice music helps keep you calm while trying to master all the games in under 5 minutes (to get the 3 star score). keep trying... I got faster and faster and just finished all the games in under 4:50; some in under 2:30 minutes. great time waster or to play to get tired enough to fall asleep.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the best romances I've read in a long time, I laughed and cried. I was sad when I finished the trilogy, it left me wanting more. I hope they'll be done again as Mr. Grey! Some of the parts were very repetitive, which got old, but all in all I loved it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book in the series best one in my opinion. Can't wait to read the third! The author wrote this book perfectly!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hesitant to read these series of books, but I'm so glad I did.  They were so easy to read. This book, Catching Fire, was the best of the series. The need to survive is a human response, along with protecting the ones you love. These books made me stop to think; could this really happen..and the answer is yes. It's already happening in some countries. If you really think something like this can't happen..think again.  Read it to see what I'm talking about... oh, the suspense...
B0054VVRBQ|4.0|In an older MacBook Pro, I got this card to work.  But, it kind of reminded me of my Windows day of yore.  This wasn't plug and play.  Go ahead and buy it, but be prepared for some wonky-ness.  For OSX 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) you'll need to download a driver, that you'll have to find for yourself from  Transcend's website.  When you install it, there will be an error, and the card wont work correctly until you restart your machine with the card installed.<br /><br />Really weird.  The error that driver throws is really weird.  I installed it a 2nd time, without an error message, and everything worked.<br /><br />After I got it installed, it works great.  It rips photos from the card WAY faster than plugging the camera in via USB 2.0.  All and all, I'm happy.  Just didn't work out of the box as expected for a product advertised to be compatible with OSX.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great free app! Totally addicting! Love it! It's great to play on my kindle fire. I would reccomend this app.
B0040Z9H5K|2.0|Not much too it...  bad guy gets beat up by good guy.  Seems there were options for some depth, but likely got cut out by the producers?  The other \\"superhero\\" characters could have added some story, but until I read the reviews here I didn't realize Samuel Jackson was playing a superhero.  He always seems to dress a bit flamboyantly in movies so I didn't think anything of it.  And the female lawyer character just seemed to be shoehorned into various spots just because.<br /><br />Also some weird propaganda in the film.  The US military steels private property and we're not expected to care?  The whole issue of whether the suit is a \\"weapon\\" with no mention of the 2nd amendment?<br /><br />\\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\"<br /><br />How is that not even mentioned in the beginning hoopla?  You have a law on the books that supersedes all others and it isn't even mentioned and specifically pertains to this issue and it isn't even mentioned?  But maybe in this fictional USA they don't have a democratic republic?  Maybe it is just an overtly nationalistic and corporatist regime with a federal government that reigns supreme?
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Little slow at first then I couldn't put the book down. I was taking my book with me everywhere. Great and entertaining! Can't wait to see what happens in the next book!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE AND I LOVED IT. THE ACTING WAS GREAT, THE STORY LINE WAS SUPERB. I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE TO BE RELEASED ON DVD. IF THIS MOVE HAD GOTTEN THE MEDIA ATTENTION, I THINK IT WOULD WIN SOME AWARDS IN AMERICA. I WILL GIVE IT FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS TO ABOUT SEVEN PEOPLE.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great game love it play it all the timeI like the fact that the dragons look really cool when they've been evolved to a higher level
B00846REIS|5.0|There are a lot of similarities with Shades of Gray but it was a juicy page turner.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All three of these books are GREAT! I couldn't put them down. Even though the books are considered to be for the \\"young adult\\", I recommend them for people of all ages!
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I am an avid fan of Warcraft (pre-WOW) and Starcraft.  This game is a simplified version of Starcraft that you can play on the go when you have time to kill.  You play one of three races which all have special abilities.  It has campaign mode as well as a \\"pick a battleground and go\\" mode.  You can also play online P v P.<br /><br />Pros: Great intuitive game that allows for some strategy with a great campaign mode that teaches the basics<br />Cons: If you have an action left on a soldier, and you click somewhere else, you lose the action.  Also some actions aren't undo-able that probably should be.  Needs more campaign scenarios.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the movie I decided to read the book. It was captivating. In three days, I finished the whole series. I just couldn't put them down!
0439023491|5.0|THIS BOOK IS TOTALLY AWESOME! VERY HARD TO PUT DOWN! LOVE THE WAY THE AUTHOR EXPRESSES HER WORDS! SHE HAS SO MUCH TALENT ON WRITING THIS BOOK. THE FIRST ONE WAS EXCELLENT TOO! WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO HAVE A GREAT TIME WHILE READING!! HAPPY READING!!
0312263511|1.0|It is sad to me that a man of Mr. Cernan's age seems not to have matured to the point where he doesn't feel the need to use a swear word in every other sentence to sound macho.  It really ruined the reading experience, and despite his going to the moon, I came away feeling he was diminished by his own book.  The guy seems too immature for \\"hero\\" status.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I had played a version of this game in puzzle books before, but those were limited to one color and a mess if you had to change your play to fix a move.  This version of CrossMe Color is GREAT especially on a tablet (like my Kindle Fire).  It uses multiple colors.  It keeps track of completed segments per line for you.  It allows for tagging of squares for possible plays.<br />I've become addicted to playing it.  As soon as I complete a picture, I can't wait to start solving the next one.<br />If you like solving logic-type puzzles, I think you will enjoy this game too.
B0019IB0II|2.0|I wanted to enjoy it and I wanted to get through it...but I didn't and I couldn't.  As hard as Bolte Taylor tries to make the book approachable, she just can't get away from the medical language and wordy descriptions.  A lot of the book was very repetitive as well.  I gave it up about 2/3 of the way through.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love having all the Harry Potter movies together in one case.  I watch these over and over with the grandkids.
B008602KQI|4.0|This is my personal opinion and you may not agree with my review and that is okay. I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it enough that I right away came home and made sure I had the Blu-ray on pre-order.<br /><br />I have to give a big thumbs up for the adaptation from the book to film. Yes there are parts of the book that are changed in the film but that has to be expected for any film from a book. After all it would be impossible to include everything in a film that is in a book. But I'd like to see someone try it sometime.<br /><br />Now one part of the movie that did disappoint me was the ending with Peeta. I am not one to ruin the movie with spoilers if you have not seen it yet, so I won't comment on what is different, but I really think that they should have followed the book.<br /><br />The second part of the film I was disappointed to see changed in the film was the meeting of Peeta and Katniss after they are in the Capitol. There is an integral part of that scene in the book, that should have been included in the film.<br /><br />These two points tie into the next story and since they were changed in the film, I'm curious to see how they cover it in the second film.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the movie. It was still understandable and easy to follow for those who have not read the series. And this I can attest to, as my spouse has not read the books, and he really liked to movie.
B004132HZS|5.0|I love all the old Basil Rathbone movies and read the Conan-Doyle books when I was a kid.  When this aired on PBS, I thought I'd check it out, but was prepared not to like this newer, updated version of the characters.......  I LOVED it!!!!!!  The writing is first rate, very clever, and wonderfully acted.  You might just fall in love with young Mr. Cumberbatch as I have.  Thank you, BBC!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I could not play it on the ipod because I have chubby fingures and this is perfect for me it has made this one of my favorite apps
B007L3BMGA|1.0|after much hype about this supposed GREAT book, I was totally disappointed with it & deleted it very soon after trying to get into it. rubbish so much hype & nothing happened.
B000KZ3BWE|5.0|first watched this on tv & never forgot . It,s impacted my life in many ways . I recycle, and really try to leave less carbon footprint . preaching to my friends , is getting me teased and laughed at , so I bought this movie for them to watch and open their eyes.I,m in my 60,s and worry for my grandchildren.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works perfectly!!  It is a great app and it is exactly as it is described.  Plus you just can not beat free!!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Quite a cheesy movie. If yu like love stories it might be good otherwise it's so-so. I expected a lot more. Actualy I am not sure what genre this movie belongs to.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It took me a minute to navigate through it but once I kind of figured it out, I was off to the races. Good job!
B008BIN9EW|3.0|Its ok, not a lot mote to say. Simple controls, basic gameplay, but no crashes or anything like that, give it a shot if you like turn based strategy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a great way to pass the time away! I find myself playing it for long periods of time!
B003X9W98G|5.0|Reasons to love this season finale:<br /><br />The Last Centurion<br />River Song facing the Dalek<br />What the Sun is Made Out Of<br />Matt Smith's Portrayal of the Doctor's Sorrow and Heroism<br />A really beautiful soundtrack from the BBC<br />\\"And you are LATE for my wedding!\\"<br />The realization of why Amy's house was the way it was<br /><br />And the wonderful cinematographic move during Amy's \\"memory\\" scene at the wedding. The focus on small objects ... just utterly poignant. This is really one of my favorite moments in the series. It sums up so much about who the Doctor is and captures in less than sixty minutes both the panache and the bittersweetness of the series.<br /><br />Reasons not to love this season finale:<br />I will let you know as soon as I find any.<br /><br />Did I mention the Last Centurion?<br /><br />Stant Litore
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I found this gem of an album when I was browsing through Amazon's $5 albums. The band really reminds me of Coldplay, OneRepublic, and Train, but with their own style and raw emotion. It took ten minutes for the music to grow on me, and now I love them. This band is going to go big very soon. You can sense-no, feel-the passion they sing with. You can especially feel it while listening to \\"Radioactive\\". \\"Radioactive and \\"It's Time\\" are great running songs. Those two songs have an addictive beat that make you feel blissful, on top of the world. Definitely the breakout of 2012. I'll update this review with other various thoughts about the songs.<br /><br />EDIT: Listened to the entire album. My favorite songs are easily \\"It's Time\\", \\"Tiptoe\\", and \\"Demons\\". The songs are exhilarating and I just want to break in dance.<br /><br />Radioactive - Really different from the the rest of the songs on this album. If I didn't know better, I probably would have thought it was from a different artist. This is invigorating, and the kind of song I'd play during a rainy day.<br /><br />Tiptoe - Addictive and a very pop-ish song.<br /><br />It's Time - This is their most famous song. This song was on Glee, and my, my is it fantastic. Energetic, and happy.<br /><br />Demons - Kind of the same vein as \\"Radioactive\\" in that it's a bit more mellow, and energetic, but not \\"happy\\" per se.<br /><br />On Top of the World - Really good song to listen to if you're down. It's pretty good, but I don't listen to this as much as the other songs.<br /><br />Amsterdam - Pretty quiet compared to the other songs, but it gets louder, and I like the rhythm and lyrics. Good, but I don't listen to to this one as much as the others.<br /><br />Hear Me - Pretty good, but this song comes from one of their EPs. Decent, but not my type of song.<br /><br />Every Night - Good rhythm, and reminiscent of a Coldplay, The Script, and The Fray mashup.<br /><br />Bleeding Out - A bit sad, and the beat is superb. It's thekind of song I'd listen to when I'm alone at home, or in the car.<br /><br />Underdog - Excellent beat and rhythm and kind of bubbles over with a happy tune.<br /><br />Nothing Left to Say/Rocks - When they say \\"on and on and on and on\\" it sounds almost like \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" by Journey. Not a bad thing, though. the songs are a bit slow-paced, and good songs to listen to, if you want to relax.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very very fun and entertaining. It keeps me from being bored and gives me something to do. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A wonderful read.  A unique and imaginative new world and culture have been created by the author.  It is very easy to get lost in the story.  Over the span of the three books, I thought the character development was thorough without being too verbose.  Great read!
B008Y6TD5A|1.0|***Spoiler Alert***<br />Do not read further if you want the joy of discovering how bad this movie is on your own.<br /><br />Where do I even start?  I thought this movie was going to be about conspiracy, but it's not.  Essentially, Elizabeth Bank's character is found guilty of murdering her boss.  We see a few flashbacks of the crime, but not enough to really know what happened.  Russell Crowe, the husband of Bank's character, exhausts the repeal process.  He then concludes his only option is to break his wife out of jail.  Completely reasonable and based in reality.  The movie then delves into Crowe's attempts to plan the big escape.  We see him try to  buy fake passports and shave keys.  He ditches his job and his son a lot to work on his escape plan.  We're introduced to a slew of characters who don't matter: the cops who arrested his wife, Olivia Wilde's character, and the deaf motorcyclist.<br /><br />Furthermore, I never could figure out the motivation for Crowe's character.  He's willing to leave his son with a woman he barely knows so he can break his wife out of jail.  Apparently leaving his son at a birthday party is part of his great escape plan, even though he forgot to read the details on the birthday invitation.  What bothered me most was his decision to rob some  drug dealers.  Bad idea to begin with, but he ends of killing one of them.  No remorse whatsoever.  No pause to rethink his whole plan.  He just continues on his path.<br /><br />I also found it implausible at the end of the movie that his wife's innocence was dependent on finding a button in a storm drain.....from three years ago.  I just highlighted some of the problems in this movie because there are soooo many.  I just felt an obligation to warn people away from this awful movie.
0596805527|5.0|everything about javascript was well explained and the presentation is well organized, useful examples. To me it would be better to have an introductory client-side javascript chapter in the first 3 or 4 chapters as most people learn javascript for client-side scripting.
0345803485|5.0|All I can really say is WOW! This book kept my attention, I couldn't put it down, and was well written.  I just got the other 2, so hopefully they will keep me as captivated as the first.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|life is too short to read all the good that has been and will be written. It's not worth wasting time on this kind of book.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|a big thank you to all the reviewers who have saved me $10.  the sample i tried seemed as if there might have been a story to follow.  i am grateful to have discovered my error in time!
B001BIL2H0|4.0|The album brought back memories of the vinyl days and college atmosphere.  The digital format and a good set of earbuds made the music sound better than before.  One play was enough though.  Times are different now, and the tone of revolution is a dated theme.  It would still be nice to go on A deck to look at the stars, if we only had a government that was capable of building a starship!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just wanted to thank the author for having the courage to speak the truth about the Osama Ben Laden raid - he is up against some very powerful adversaries that did not want a contradictory \\"story\\" from the White House to be known.  I, for one, value our soldiers on the ground for protecting our country, first and foremost.  The politicization of military action should never occur - the more our soldiers speak out - like OSPEC did - the sooner US Citizens will recognize how our politicians lie to us for their own self gain!  Thank you again for a story well told!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game on my Kindle Fire.  I had played the non-color version and enjoyed it.  The color version is even better.  As the games progress to harder levels, the time to finish them can be quite long, but you can stop and start where you left off at any time.  You always know when you have solved the puzzle because the completed picture pops up in front of you.  The only negetative is the size of the puzzle compared to the screen.  You have to widen the puzzle to make the squares large enough to touch accurately and then pinch it smaller to see the numbers along the edge.  But, that just makes the puzzle that more challenging.
B007TML4EI|4.0|The little robot guy is so cute with his worried expression. He's right to be worried cause I'm stumped at only the 2nd level! But I'm not great at these types of games, but if you are, get this one. The controls are better than Link. But if your talent lies more with Cut the Rope like me, you might find this difficult.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Get it.<br />This app is one of my favorites because its so fun to play when you are bored or just want to play an app.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|As a voracious reader, I don't know how I missed this mystery series featuring Jack Reacher.  He is the most bad-a$$ man to ever roll into town, kicking butt and solving the crime hardly even breaking a sweat.  The action is non-stop, the story is exciting and I must admit that after being introduced to Jack Reacher, my fascination with this character has grown into a full-blown addiction!  Must read all the books...Lee Childs is a prolific writer, this may take awhile...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What could be simpler?  Draw lines to connect pairs of colored dots on a grid, so that all the pairs are connected, and all the squares in the grid are used.<br /><br />Well, that last part is what makes this simple to grasp puzzle game challenging to play.  I'm pretty good with catching the patterns, and can zoom through most of the puzzles - but some do give me pause.<br /><br />Personally, I love it!  However, some may find it quite difficult.<br /><br />Hoping for more puzzles - I would easily pay a buck for additional puzzle packs....
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|When I got this I was stoked! Couldn't wait to download it. -_- Ugh boy was I wrong.<br />&bull;First complaint- It was BEYOND buggy, almost to a point that I couldn't even see my guy.<br />&bull;Second- I bought something that was very expensive! The golden jetpack but when I came back to the game, it was GONE! And I didn't even get my money back!!<br /><br />Updates that *might* make me change my review<br />1.Less Bugs!!<br />2. Get money back<br />3. Smother game ride like the Iphone version<br />4. Special coin upgrades that stay forever<br /><br />Thanks for trying, but bad fail Devs.<br /><br />~Amy~V~
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and when I realized that the pinterest app came out I was sceptical but now that I have been using it I love it.  It works great and I definately recommend it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|there are way too many ads, I try to start drawing and an ad pops up. it happens like three times in one drawing. other than that its a very good game:)
B007TML4EI|4.0|This game was a challenge for sure. You have a given budget to build a protective structure around your dummy human from bombs ; boulders and other objects. Graffics are good and there is a tutorial to show you exactly how to play. Have fun.<br />Florida Mom
B007TML4EI|4.0|no problems running it on my Galaxy Nexus. interesting game. I definitely makes you think about force vectors, and etc., we'll worth the download.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I hated this book. I wasn't expecting a book about sado-masochists. I actually thought EL James stood for Eloisa James - I got about 20 pages into the book and was so disgusted that I quit reading it. As soon as I can figure out how to delete books from my Kindle that will be the first to go.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I understand that there is a big hype going on regarding the 50 shades books... I completely understand why.  These books may not be suitable for teenagers to read, but they make even the darkest of adults play with further darkness.  I would recommend these books to anyone who just wants some light reading of a darker world.
B00846TTDG|5.0|very good story action and acting was very authentic.  i was entertained through the beginning till the end.  narration was very intence and very positive also.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the rope is a very fun game. In fact it is one of the best apps ever. One of the best things about Cut the rope is that cute little monster he is just so cute that I just want to hug him. Also the gameplay is very unique you cut the rope and try to keep the candy away from stuff like spikes and spiders. Forget any app you've ever seen. Get this one!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't often get caught up in a book, but I was drawn in to Ready Player One. I finished it in just a few days. If you have any interest in video games and other geek culture, you should definitely pick it up.
1609611543|1.0|My husband expressed an interest in this book after it was mentioned on TV.  I found the book quickly on Amazon and ordered it. When it arrived I looked through it.  Because I have been a vegan for 21 years, I am distressed that the author recommends eating meat and dairy products.  As far as I am concerned this makes his entire book suspect.  I have avoided wheat products for a long time because of the high glycemic index.  However, I do not use that as an excuse to eat dead animals.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the most breath taken book I have read in years.I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It will light up your boring life
B008645YEE|3.0|This soundtrack is a poor compilation of only a fraction of the music used in the The Dark Knight Rises.<br />It is quite poorly mastered and the fact that the four mainstay themes is omitted is beyond stupid.<br />Thoose four themes you can only get through the iPhone only app or from youtube and that is in low-fi not worthy of a listen.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer is a genius, but this is too little, mastered way too loud and as such a commercially inspired disgrace.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Like the first one, this book is really well written and keeps the reader captivated!  Offers more insights into the dark past of Christian Gray and let's the reader inside Ana's ambivalence about all she learns.  Truly another enjoyable read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|...but what app doesn't? This is a fun and easy way to access and use pinterest and I would recommend to anyone! Just watch out...it is addicting!  :)
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Beautiful scenes of Paris, great musical score and a very nicely written script all come together to make this the best Woody Allen film in a very long time.  The characters are great and the acting is spot on.  Hemingway is a riot, depicted in much the same way that I always considered he might have been.  The Surrealists are just too much fun and Kathy Bates' take on Gertrude Stein is great.  Sure, you have to buy into the entire time travel concept but it is a fantasy after all, not a non-fiction piece.  Owen Wilson does a fine job as the \\"Hollywood hack\\" searching for meaning in his time by exploring the Paris of the 1920's.  Rachel McAdams is just perfect as his self-centered, very American fiance. And we all know a guy just like the \\"pedantic one\\", don't we?<br />The shots of Paris leave little doubt that Woody is in love with the place, if you have ever been there you will understand and recognize many of the locations.  The cinematography is lovely and gives the film a nice, warm feeling.  The score is a fine mix of Cole Porter songs and Parisienne jazz.<br />Am I in love with Paris?  Well, gee, isn't it obvious?  I cannot wait to return for a nice stroll around the most beautiful city in the world...in the rain of course.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|I'm one of the many Kiss fans who's extremely frustrated with Gene and maybe even Paul's greedy way of taking advantage of their fans and vowed to NEVER spend another penny on ANY Kiss product, but when I read that \\"Destroyer\\" was going be to remixed by Bob Ezrin, I got really excited. The original product description stated that this was to be a 2 Disc release with Outtakes, Demos, and Live tracks but that was not to be. I think a lot of people just love to bitch and complain about everything. Sure we didn't get a 2 Disc set with Demos, etc. which would have been really awesome, but we got what most fans consider Kiss' best studio album remixed.<br /><br />Everything sounds so much clearer now. I don't think I ever really truly appreciated the complexity of Peter's drumming on this album until I heard this remix. His \\"kick drum\\" work on this album is more forward up on this new mix. The guitars sound so much clearer especially on \\"King Of The Night Time World\\", \\"Shout It Out Loud\\", \\"Great Expectations\\", and \\"Do You Love Me\\". The harmonies are more present in the mix and it really adds so much to each track. Of course there were some problems with this release. First and foremost, there is a dropout at the beginning of \\"Flaming Youth\\" that everyone is complaining about. I thought maybe people were just bitching but sadly this mistake is audible. Maybe if you've never heard the song before you may not catch it, but the hardcore fans noticed it right away. This to me is the only one true \\"problem\\" with this new mix. Everything else people complain about is just personal opinion for example no reverb on certain parts of songs that you can hear on the original mix, etc. Bob Ezrin did a great job on this release and he should be proud!<br /><br />Again, this release wasn't meant to replace the original mix of the album that we all love and listened to repeatedly over the years, it was meant to give it a fresh new sound to it. You don't have to buy it of course but I would recommend this to old Kiss fans and hopefully new Kiss fans! \\"...it looks like we're gonna have ourselves, a rock and roll party!\\"<br /><br />*****************EDIT***************<br />I just got the HDTracks version of the album and \\"Flaming Youth\\" does not skip! So I guess I would advise people to just purchase the HD Tracks and not the Mp3s or CD.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Edgar R. Burroughs has got to be one of my favorite authors ever since childhood when I<br />first discovered his stories retold in comic book format. First there was the savage<br />of Africa, Tarzan. Strong and adaptive to his environment and somehow in tune with the<br />animals that dwelt in the world he knew so well. Fighting off evil doers and protecting<br />the innocent!  Almost sounds like Superman!<br />Yet even the earth was not enough for ERB! With interest in our nearest neighbor and in<br />the mystery of its reddish color a new hero was borned, John Carter! What an imaginative<br />feat of developing a logical sequence of transporting this 1800s earthman from the blue<br />planet to the red planet! And with a background of wormholes, time-travel, and out-of-body<br />experiences, the jump to Mars takes no time at all to develop, playing a secondary role to the presence of a world on the edge of disaster.<br />The picture that is painted by the storyline is another ERB epic with very cool beasts that provide both excitement and humor to the story. One man alone on an alien world<br />pitted against beasts and other humanoids make this movie of a man, as savage, without<br />his jungle to protect, but with a world to overcome!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app... it is a great time waster... it really sends the boredom into the hypothetical closet... whatever that is...
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|This is one really terrible movie.  What may seem like an appealing adventure involving a young boy walking around New York City searching for clues with a key, turns into a horrendous mess that goes absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />The problem is without a doubt the character of Thomas Horn.  His acting is overblown, exaggerated and incredibly stiff.  It's not the least bit realistic that a young kid would act the way he does, and he's obviously trying WAY too hard to deliver his lines (hence the stiff part).  This means you don't feel any compassion for his character, or care about him or his \\"adventure\\" in any way, shape or form.  It's reminiscent and perhaps influenced by Haley Joel Osment from the Sixth Sense, which is precisely the reason *that* movie failed so miserably.  The difference is that Haley's overconfident character destroyed the horror in the Sixth Sense, and Thomas' character destroys the sense of adventure here.<br /><br />To add more to the frustration is that there's nothing but one confusing segment after another.  Why did Thomas visit the African American woman and treat her so politely by insisting on snapping a photo of her beautiful face?  Why was he hiding under his bed a short time later?  I can't even say that the overconfidence of Thomas Horns' character is solely the reason this movie is so horrible.  The storyline being confusing is probably equally to blame.  What a waste of time.  His only spectacular moment comes when he argues with his mother (played by Sandra Bullock).<br /><br />When the boy explains that his father was killed in the 9/11 incident and delivers a bunch of fast-paced frantically delivered lines, math equations and other clues, this is when I finally said \\"Alright, I'm done with this\\" and shut it off.  This was about halfway through.  The TV show Touch that recently came out last year was probably influenced by this, but Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is way worse than the show thanks to Thomas Horn trying way too hard to be believable and mature but losing all sense of adventure, compassion and interest in the process.  Proof that you may have what it takes to be a quality actor, but end up terribly boring anyway.  As for Tom Hanks, what's it been, 15 years since his last good movie?  Skip it.
B001226I7Y|5.0|I love Live Rust! Has so many iconic Neil Young hits and exceptional energy. Great for listening when youre reading or just hanging out or for jamming out to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The reason I like this book is because the author really makes the characters believable in this book. The characters could easily be someone you know such as a friend or neighbor. Get all 3 books before you start to read because once you start you will not want to put them down.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The book kept me interested all the way threw.  The autor was very interesting. It is very seldom that I find a book that I don't want to put down.
B007TML4EI|1.0|its a little obvious on how fake the 5 star reviews are and the screen always goes black when u open it.... bad game overall
0525953728|5.0|I have ready a couple other books about or by special operators/operations and have enjoyed them but not necessarily the way the author came across. Hands down this book is the best book I have read in a while. It just felt real, and I am not talking about his account of the UBL operation but the way he portrayed all aspects of his story.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. It ranges from very easy puzzles to extremely difficult. I've been playing this game for months and I'm still not tired of it.
B004PMVSFA|5.0|Love movies like this....sometimes you just need a little wholesome entertainment<br />Specially if your week started off on the wrong foot or just having one of those days where you can watch something wholesome and relaxing.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|A very solid and fun to play turn based strategy.  The units are unique enough where each faction must play differently.  Map editor is also a nice plus.  I wish it had system notifications though.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After awhile, the book became a little ridiculous.  No matter the problem, sex was always the answer.  That becomes very shallow after awhile not to mention unrealistic.  The book needed more substance.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read this book a few weeks after finishing Gone Girl. I think I liked this one better. Not sure. Both are fun to read and pulled me through to the end. However, Sharp Objects had more moments where I had to look up from the book and think, \\"WHAT THE CRAP?!\\"<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Is it the mom? Is it the sister? Is it Alan? Is it John? All four characters popped out in my mind as possibles. Then I was sure it was the mom after the cheek biting incident. The twist as to who it was in the end was pretty solid. Very well done. I also really enjoyed the flawed, serious ones at that, of the MC. Poor Camille.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />I did notice a few things that bothered me. The constant use of the word \\"sticky\\" to describe the MC's state. The impossible beauty of the MC despite her habits that would almost certainly make her not so. Sorry, but anyone who drinks the way she does is NOT GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL post age 30. She'd be looking 40. Not to mention the other vices she's put herself through. I also noted that there were some similar lines in this book as in GG. Most striking was the note that people speak the same lines as what they hear in movies, becoming a cliche.<br /><br />Speaking of cliche, I absolutely detest authors excusing the use of cliches by noting it. It does not make it right!<br /><br />All in all a solid book and a fun read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very catching indeed, definally a sequal you have to read. Katniss is being pressed by the president and she is failing to keep people from harm ending up starting a ugly thing which is called War.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Excellent blu-ray imaging!  Very happy to have it in my collection.  I've been waiting for these movies for a long time and was not disappointed!
0634060384|5.0|Nicely laid out, easy to read, and useful for the most common standards in the jazz repertoire.  Unfortunately, due to copyright issues, some of the tunes present in the illegal version are missing, but this is through no fault of Hal Leonard.  A very useful tool for learning tunes!
B001EYU1VO|5.0|True to form, this stick proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Saitek has it spot on with their Cyborg line of flight sticks. I bought the original years ago to use with the Mechwarrior series of games and loved it's handiness on the battlefield. I eventually wore the thing out and replaced it with another. I purchased the PS38 as an upgrade to my furtherance of online gaming eliteness and it has fully facilitated that quest in games such as F-16 and Jumpgate.
6305428352|5.0|This movie is a very heart-warming story about a frustrated composer who has to become a music teacher to make a living.  While the storyline of his development as a teacher and the growth of his music program is a touching story in itself, it also touches on several issues outside of the narrative that are still present in education today; namely, the cutting of arts programs in schools in favor of math and science.  This movie demonstrates how important music is in the lives of students and how important it is in creating well-rounded young minds.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I watched this movie in HD on Blu-ray, and it was stunning. The attention to detail was truly mind boggling, and I never ceased finding things to marvel at. What makes the artistry of this movie truly awesome is just how different it is. Whereas every animated movie that I can think of features cute, cuddly critters (which is also cool, by the way), the animators of this flick took a COMPLETELY different approach. They made every character ugly... REAL ugly. But therein lies a good deal of Rango's charm. Whether you're looking at crusty lizards, mangy possums, or dusty birds, these universally unattractive critters still manage to be extremely likable. You're not attached to how cute they are, but rather, the strength of their character. Hilarious dialogue and superb voice acting complete the package. Kids will love this movie, and so will adults!
0425263908|5.0|Great Book, well written, would recommend if you liked 50 Shades of Grey. Pre-ordered the next book in the series already!
B008EQIEWS|4.0|You gotta give it up for Liam Neeson. Who else gets to take on roles for a Jedi Knight, Batman's mentor, and Zeus, the King of the Gods? Unfortunately, he isn't given much to work with in this particular role, but neither are any of the other actors. The closest thing to an enjoyable character we get in this flick is Poseidon's estranged, hippie son, who begins to refer to himself as \\"The Navigator\\" about halfway through the movie.<br /><br />But this movie is not about character development and the existential dilemma. It's about battlin' beasties, mashin' monsters, and grapplin' with gods. And on that score, this movie is a pure success. The CGI is masterfully done (for the most part), with the high light being the two-headed, fire-spewing creature that smashes up Perseus' town BUT GOOD. Although it's strange to see (MINOR SPOILER AHEAD) a really lame looking minotaur rampaging about a labyrinth (it damn near looks like some dude running around in a rubber mask), the other special effects are just that- special (END SPOILER). The climatic showdown with Kronos can't quite live up to the Kraken's finale in the previous movie, but \\"Wrath\\" still has its merits. Fans of Greek mythology and monsters will enjoy the show.
1476712042|5.0|Started reading it yesterday morning and by last night it was done, can't wait to read Travis's view when the next book, Walking Diaster comes out.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Love this game, it'll keep you entertained for a minute or an hour. There are plenty of missions to keep it interesting.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book after the Fifty Shades Trilogy. I must admit, I never thought another book would interest me, but this one was quite a catch!! Very much looking forward to the release of the next book!!!
B000I186FW|4.0|What a movie should do. Entertain; provoke thought; have a interesting plot. V for violent also. Can acheive same end result without all the violence.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was hot, it had a story line that flowed well together and I could not put it down. I will definitely read the series again.
0060566108|5.0|This was an enlightening book revealing what made the difference between a good and bad company, or management team.  I highly recommend this book.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Great season and I can't believe the ending episode ...I sooooo can't wait for Season 7 to be available.  The writers are amazing.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this app is extremely fun. but it seems like the farther u get the more glitchy its gets. but I still love
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After reading the first two books I thought I could kind of surmise what the third book would be and therefore, had some hesitation about reading it.  But, after talking with some other fans about book three, decided to go ahead and finish the trilogy.  Glad I did as it was very enjoyable, as readable as books one and two and although \\"all came out well in the end\\" the getting there was not a sure thing as I read the book. Some surprises, good ones, and all in all, a good read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series is very engaging.  Like a good book you can not wait to view the next episode.  I am anxiously wAiting for the next season.
B008M34INW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film,Get the Gringo. Moreso than his early films. This film was much more detailed with Gibson's character still geared toward action but much less a stereotypical Hollywood action hero. What I appreciated, aside from being well entertained by this movie, was seeing that age has made Gibson create lead characters of more depth and unpredictableness while still staying true to the action hero mold.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|TThe Hunger Games is a very good movie.  My wife and 2 boys enjoyed the complexity of the story and the acting was top notch. I don't always enjoy Woody Harrelson's acting but, he did a fine job in this film.  The young cast was great, especially Jennifer Lawrence.  She is a fine young actress with a bright future. Overall, a movie I am proud to own.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /> Rates among the worst writing I have encountered in a book. Erotic literature can be well written and interesting. This one is neither.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Many friends have not wanted to see the movie due to the violence, and the topic of kids killing kids. I am all about squeemish- please dont let that thinking stop you from seeing this movie, they made this movie for our type. It is about sooo much more, and how one person can make a change. It is so timely and so good and well done. I read all three books and cant wait for the next two movies. The story could be anywhere, now even. Its about us, human beings and who still has a soul. You wont be sorry rent this and read the books. Better yet give the set of books to any young adult on your Christmas/ Hanakah list.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|it was funny and wholesome a good movie for the family. the plot is great and story made sense good script
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evermore on my 3 go-to platforms. My Kindle Fire, my laptop running Windows 7, and my iPhone 4s. I love being able to jot notes on any of my devices and being able to retrieve from any device with access to the Internet. Great productivity enhancer!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not what I thought it would be. The content was very repetitive. The story is very interesting but I felt I was reading the same page over and over. It taught me a lesson: never buy a book for that much money before reading the reviews first.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm still on the first book, but it caught me from the start.  I'm also watching the series on HBO and I find that the detail in the book is very helpful in understanding the twists and turns of the series.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This movie keeps you on your toes! It shows how currupt the judicial system is,how lawyers work the system and why it cost us a fortune! SPOT ON
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I really haven't played the DVD's yet, but I know I love the movies and I'm really glad they came out in a trilogy pack.  Otherwise I probably wouldn't have gotten them.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|i like this book.  it moves pretty quickly and I already have the faces in mind because I've watched the show.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! Didn't feel like it taught me much about sex,(a lot of people said they learned a few things. Then again, I'm just into plain ole vanilla). However, I am a sucker for romance and it was the perfect love story. Great book and ending! Can not WAIT for the movie!!!!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This movie was really good and entertaining it was such a funny and heartwarming story you can enjoy again and again. This movie is a must-see. I highly recommend it!,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really good game. you can never get tired of play it. I encourage everyone to get this app and play it. buy it now
B004XWLN20|5.0|Smallville has been fantastic :). To see all the seasons again back to back was amazing.<br />  Like most of the others, I did experience some difficulty with how tight the CDs were. All I did though was just pinch the casing together so it tweaked open and I could grab them without scratching the disc more or less.<br />  Other than that little problem the box set is worth every penny.
B008XG1X18|5.0|far better than what was available on kindle before - nothing and tons better than the droid app on my phone.
B001NI24OI|5.0|This is a great story.  The film is well done.  Finally, the soundtrack is great. I watched this twice during my 24 hour rental.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I wish they had put more in and stuck to the truth about the pin. Its going to come into play later, at least I had hoped it would. Otherwise great movie!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the Hunger Games.  So fun to see the book come to life on the screen and right in my family room!  Many times a film is disappointing compared to the book.  This time, it caught the essence of the story of survival, hope and courage.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing....probably the funnewt gqme i hqve on my kindle! GET IT, u will not regret it...fun for days on end
B004XIZN5M|5.0|There are plenty of things I din't like a bout this book<br /><br />1. The title, I'm not a big fan of convicts, but I guess this one does have some good things to teach.<br /><br />2. There's no pictures of the author, biography or even examples of him doing any of the moves in this book.<br />I can understand why people question if the author even exist!<br /><br />3. The author insults and redicules weightlifters and their stregth training methods. I absolutely hate weights, but even I can't deny that the strongest men in world have all used weights in their training, a fact the author omits. Weights are the fastest way to get strong, period.<br /><br />4. The author claims many old school athletes build their strength with bodyweigths, which is a bunch of bull they all are known for lifting weights.<br /><br />So, with all the things I didn't like a bout this book, why five stars?<br />Because the core material of the book, the progresions, deserve every single one of those stars.<br />I have never seen any other bodyweight book as advance as this one.<br />The material here is light years a head of any thing I have read a bout bodyweight training.<br />I have read people critizing the book, mentioning that you can get these excersises for free on the net.<br />Maybe you can, but not in such a detailed, progressive and strength oriented way. You don't just get a book, you get streght goals and to me that's pure motivation.<br /><br />Weightlifter should get this book, just know that the author will eronously bash weightlifters a bit. Lets be honest, for what ever reason, there will be a time in your life where you will not be able to lift and this book can come real handy since you will all ways have your body to train with.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Although an older person, and now not sexually active, I still find the reading a positive experience. The conduct of Christian Grey though, does not fill me with any great thoughts of emulation. Ana is, on the other hand, a joy to read about, and is set to live life to the fullest.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I could read for hours and still want more. Great love story, good making love moments. Not to much not to little, always wanting more.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Movie keeps your attention from start to finish.  I have not read the books yet, but still enjoyed this movie. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am so interested in this love story. She falls head over heels for this Mr. Gray business man. He is curious about her. He follows her till he gets her. She just keeps falling for him over and over. He starts buying her a phone to a laptop to the car. The more he asks her  if she wants to do it , the more she wants to get it done to her. They fall in love but can't tell each other. When they start to get closer you need to get the other book. Enjoy
B001YV502C|5.0|Brilliantly staged and choregraphed action takes a slight backseat to astonishing cinematography. This is one of the best shot action movies I've ever seen and it demands to be seen on Blu-ray. Just a really intense and interesting film.<br /><br />The visual transfer is superb, and will fill your widescreen TV. The gritty streets and raw violence look very sharp. The colors pop and the grain is minimal. The audio transfer is great as well. The score sounds beautiful and explosions rock the walls.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Very good book couldnt put it down. Sparks is a great writer hard to believe a man wrote this book. I feel sorry for the little kid thou
B00000F214|4.0|This movie is great but its not as good as its famous quote. \\"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\\" This movie is a well made and smartly written film, its just perhaps a bit less dynamic than it could have been. Al great performances across the board.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|This is a great classic movie. Don't expect modern sci-fi action. It has a campy old comicbook feel with a legendary soundtrack by Queen. Anyone who remembers this movie loves it. Showed it to my kids and they loved it too.
1932100660|5.0|Best book on nutrition. Insightul, comprehensive. Highly recommended. It contradicts the common brief and takes a position of opposition, based on intensive research.
0345803485|1.0|Not only is this book very poorly written but that \\"topic\\" scenes were boring and uninteresting. Don't fall for the hype. The time you waste reading this book you will never get back.
B003Y5H556|4.0|If ever there was a film to be seen in the Blu-Ray format, its this one Director Christine Hardwicke's 'RED RIDING HOOD', a wonderful tribute to the original dark story line before the Brothers Grimm cleaned it up.  You have read all these reviews but its important to state that this alternate cut works much better than the theatrical one.  After Peter is bitten by the werewolf at the climax, the theatrical print cuts to Valerie and Peter burying the body in a nearby lake.  In the alternate cut, there is a nice erotic love scene between them and then comes the burial.  After Peter leaves the town, we hear Valerie's voice narration letting us know the time exposition of the town and characters and again the cuts differ.  In the original ending, we see Valerie exiting her grandmothers house in full red robe regalia stooping to pick flowers and looking up to see Peter in werewolf form gazing at her as she gives him a Mona Lisa like smile before it fades to the credits.  The alternate is much better, we see Valerie approach her grandmothers house and as she turns we see her carrying a baby which is obviously Peter's procured after the excised erotic romp on the red cape.  Peter in werewolf form appears and Valerie with child smiles back at him as the credits emerge.  Within the atmosphere and feel of the film, this cut works much better and obviously the test audience that voted on the other cut must have have been asleep most of the time. The werewolf scenes are very impressive even though they are CGI generated. The extras are also bountiful as Warner Bros. releases it in a nice 2.35 transfer with unbelievable sound and many featurettes including rehearsals and screen tests of the main actors.  Although critics were not very kind to it, the film deserves to be in every horror fans collection because its a great werewolf movie and Director Hardwicke who gave us the saccharine ridden 'TWILIGHT'-2009 has emerged as a filmmaker that should be watched in the years to come.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is such a great app! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the book! Couldn't put it down! I recommend mockingjay to all adults who have read the other 2 books in the series.
B000059TFO|3.0|It was very very used with water damage to the case.  I don't know which company sent me the dvd?
B00009TB5G|5.0|A fantastic film with incredible extra features and scenes.  Would never want to watch the regular film after seeing the extended edition with was amazing.
0425263908|3.0|I liked the book but was very surprised by how much the story line is just like that of 50 Shades of Grey. It seemed like the ideas were copied and not original. Overall it is a good book but if you have read the Grey series you may not be a fan.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This compelling story's mechanism is a skillful weaving in and out of the present and the past, beginning with the introduction of 18 year old Victoria as she prepares to leave the foster care system. Victoria frustrates the reader with her many self-destructive choices, but they are made understandable as the tale of her childhood experience in foster care unfolds, a time filled with unspeakable cruelty and devoid of tenderness and nurturing. The one exception was the period spent with Elizabeth, herself damaged, but who succeeds in instilling in Victoria her special gift of communicating in the language of flowers. But even this positive experience tragically stalls for Victoria, reinforcing her suspicions that succumbing to hope and longing for love are foolish and can only lead to despair. Elizabeth similarly experiences a circuitous path to happiness. The courage these characters summon to overcome their challenges and begin healing are heart-wrenching. This is a story of courage, misunderstanding, redemption and finally the acceptance of self-love and the love of others into a parched heart.I didn't want this book to end, having grown so attached to all of the characters with their strengths and flaws. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for an engrossing read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved every moment of this series! You don't need to be a huge fan of fantasy books, but you will need some free time.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I was using Magic Puzzle and really  liked it.  Then I got an upgrade and don't like it at all.  The second app I downloaded and the pieces won't rotate.  I have quit trying to use the app.  Very disappointed as I had just bought puzzles.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|slay em all and destroy all goblins and cemers. kill them slay em slice and dice them what a bad life
0443069522|3.0|This book is fine for a textbook for anatomy.  For pure pictures, you will definitely want to get either Gilroy or Moses however.  There are a few pages where the pictures are slightly better than those other two, but for the vast majority of the time, Gilroy or Moses is the way to go.  If you feel the need to read about the anatomy, Gray's is useful.  I tend to have the Gray's open as I go, to be able to learn via text the position of things.  If budget cutting though, get the other two and skip this one.  You will not miss it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Nearly the same game as 'Where's My Water' and just as good. There are a few unique features to keep it interesting and keep you playing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If this game was alive I would marry it.<br />it has over 101-in-1 games in it and gives you money for the games you complete or play
B005FISBTO|5.0|I have all six seasons on dvd. I'll buy seasons 7 & 8 as soon as they're out on dvd. I LOVE Dexter! Best show ever! Oh, but if you buy season 6 on dvd DON'T watch the Showtime add at the beginning of every dvd as there's a huge spoiler! You can't fast fwd or skip, so just be sure NOT to watch the Showtime add that comes up before the menu on the dvd's. I was fortunate enough to not have been paying attention to the add on all six dvd's so my OMG moment was not spoiled. Avoid the add & don't spoil your OMG moment either. Other than that, LOVE Dexter!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|challenging and fun. beautiful graphics and soothing music. I'm really interested in checking out some of the other apps by fallen tree games
B004EPYZTE|4.0|Looked great, decent acting, awesome battle and death scenes (some were thoroughly disgusting). My boyfriend and I went in knowing the movie was gonna be lame but there are only so many 3d movies to choose from.  Anyways, when it was over we both said \\" that was actually pretty good!\\".  I would watch it again......weird that I never heard anything about this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my first e-book, using kindle for ipad, and I love it! Great story! Can't waIt to read the second book!
0525953728|5.0|Fantastic book! I highly recommended it to anyone interested in reading about America and the war against terrorism. So relevent today.
B007TMON8M|5.0|what an amazing game. different objectives that challenge your mind, build up some sense into basic forces we live in.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I'm looking forward to watching this with you, snuggled up tight with a heavy blanket over us as it's snowing outside. When you quote this movie, for some reason it reminds me of the way you tease me about my Maine accent, what we like to call \\"Maineisms\\". Sometimes I can be a man of few words, but I find you adorable in every way, even if your Minnesota accent sounds completely ridiculous to me. Fella's, watch this movie with your girlfriend.
B007TML4EI|5.0|the game takes long to load when opened and you sit at a black screen. But once it loads the challenge begins. create different methods to protect your guy and in others also destroy melvins evil double.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Sons of anarchy is my favorite show. It's the best on tv. I highly recommend it to everyone can't wait for season 5
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|This movie is fabulous. It's my favorite. No problems with the disc or shipping. I highly recommend this to people who want it!
B003E88TKS|3.0|I thought it was pretty boring.  I can't say as this did anything for me.  It was a sad movie about having to fire people.  YUK!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This series is awesome. However, book four only follows characters from King's Landing and book five follows all the other characters. I like reading about all the characters at the same time...it's way more enticing. If I had known I would have bought book four and five at the same time and switched off reading from book to book.
0425263908|5.0|I thought this book was very well written. Am in total love with both of these broken characters.  Hoping they will heal each other. Anticipating the next installment.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|Loved this series - so excited that I can watch it any time now. Watching it from beginning to the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I watched The Hunger Games and just knew there was more to the story than what I saw on film. Great book, well written, and one of those books you just can't put down...<br />  Read the entire book in a day and a half then moved to the last book. Read the series!
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Written so well and gave me such a wonderful understanding of a subject which can be so difficult for someone without any prior knowledge of biology to understand! Such an incredible and interesting topic and I look forward to reading about further advances!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Nice game that will keep you entertained for a while. There are some things that could be better but the game was free so I can't complain about that.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Really amazing work. Just re-read the Resistance and Fundamentalism chapter again and sighed a \\"wow\\" at the end. Not much of a review writer, but I had to stop by and say thank you so much for writing this book.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A refreshing change from PI, detectives and murder. A story that searches inside rather than the outside world for it's content. A touching narrative
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app it tells me how much time I have on each thing before my kindle will die
B00846REIS|4.0|It was a hard book to put down I absolutely loved it. I would recommend it to anyone who was look for a good read
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it it really connects you to the lord I really do love ot its the best you can get besides going to church and the holy book I love him so much!!
0783219695|5.0|I wanted this movie to assist with my study of leadership qualities of Capt. Lovell. All items were included as advertised and the video quality was like new.
B005FISBTO|5.0|The show itself is, as always, a joy to watch. The product was very well priced and shipped promptly, much faster than expected. I would definitely order again. Highly recommended.
B000NA28I4|3.0|This movie is based off an amazing series of books - sadly, the movie did not meet the standards of the books. It was an okay movie, with good parts mixed in, but the movies seemed to drag until you got to one of those moments, and then it dragged after the excitement was over.
0385742886|1.0|This was not a prequel in any way to the original series.  Its a bunch of 'run, fight, run' and then at the very end he just threw in a quick reference to one of the original characters.  (Almost as if he forgot this was supposed to tie them together!)  It was obvious that Deedee was Theresa, but no mention of Thomas until the very end and never did they put those two together.  I kept waiting for the story to turn towards the storyline but it never did.  It would be like making the prequels to Star wars without Darth Vader ever being mentioned.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|Guy Ritchie's testosterone-fueled sfx can be thrilling when helping to rev up a good narrative (as in the first Sherlock Holmes). Unfortunately, here, they're just pushing a convoluted turd into overdrive.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written.  Repetitive.  NOT the \\"kinky\\" novel everyone makes it out to be.  The sex scenes are 90% \\"vanilla\\" sex.... and that's also 90% of the book.  There is virtually no storyline.  The main characters bicker, have sex, bicker some more, and then more sex.  Tiring, boring, and tedious.<br /><br />The writing is terrible.  Please don't get me started on the main character's subconscious and \\"inner goddess\\" (two SEPARATE characters living in her own mind) which appear in her imagination to dance or scowl at her far too often.<br /><br />It was painful to get through, but given all the hype, I trudged through it waiting for it to improve.  It didn't.  Save your money and your time.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like all the different translations available. What I don't like is having to be online in order read some of them.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This app allows you to carry your books in your pocket. Unfortunately I have not found a way to sync books not purchased through Amazon across my devices, which makes it awkward to read a book on my Kindle and then pickup where I left off on my Android phone.[[ASIN:B004DLPXAO Kindle for Android]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was good. just doing this to get free points soooo get it. its good. you will enjoy it a lot a whole lot
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is an additive game I love it. I have my daughter and wife as well as my mother-in-law hooked on this game!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was using the pinterest app on my phone because all the apps on here were terrible!! this is just awesome! thanks!!!
B0091VTISO|4.0|I wish Amazon would give us the ability to rate Movies & TV content without writing a review. That being said I loved this Conan movie. It told a very good story, contained alot of action but could do with some more nudity - this is Conan afterall.
030758836X|1.0|There's absolutely nothing thrilling about this \\"thriller.\\"  I hated it, hated the characters and didn't care about their story.  This book is not worthy of the hype it's been receiving.  Don't waste your time!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was a great read that kept you guessing. You were almost manipulated by the characters and constantly wondering what would happen next. It was great!
B009329Y30|4.0|What can I say?  My girlfriend horn-swaggled me into watching another chick flick.<br />Well, it was her turn to choose, so I hung in there.<br />To my surprise it was a good and entertaining movie, with all the gushy stuff that any girlfriend could possibly like.  So, if you're afraid of letting your girlfriend pick a chick flick, don't be.  There may be fringe benefits after the show.<br />This movie was well acted with a good cast of characters, and the best part of it was that there was even a story - a good story.<br />Now I may not be the Siskel and Ebert of the Streaming Amazon, but I do recommend this movie for couples night out.<br />Just make sure you have a tissue or two handy for your special lady.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought it was one of the best book to movies I ever saw. It was awesome! I want to watch it again!
B00932A2MC|3.0|Good special effects and good mindless explosions.  It was a whole lot more fun than watchin' the Dukes of Hazard wreck cars.<br />If you're hung-up on reality, then don't bother.  Does anybody know how long it takes to put an Iowa Class Battleship to sea?  With a full crew compliment?  Well, just don't let those details worry your pretty little heads pilgrim.  Just sit back and watch a bunch of John Wayne types light the ships boilers with their cigars to get underway to defeat an alien that has travelled millions of light years to stomp on our bug-like butts.<br />Oh, and does anybody realize just how much a sixteen inch artillery round weighs? Hint: Think of a mid-seventies model Cadillac.  Now how many sailers does it take to pick one up and carry it through the bulkheads of a battle wagon?<br />Like I said, don't sweat the details.  Just enjoy the carnage and destruction.<br />P.S. Don't shake hands with a four fingered alien.  Especially if each of their fingers opposes all of the others.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Lots of different groupings to keep you playing. the best part is playing against your own time.  You will enjoy this version.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The Japanese version of this movie was down-right brutal.<br />Brutal you say?  I thought Hunger Games was brutal? Well, not really if you've seen it's predecessor movie - Battle Royale.<br />It's an interesting concept and a movie of \\"Love Thy Neighbor, but Just Be Sure that you Kill Them Before They Kill You!\\"<br />I recommend that you watch the Japanese version of this movie first.  Then Hunger Games will seem like a nice Walt Disney special playing for the family on Sunday evening.<br />I recommend this movie for anyone who is under water on their mortgage.<br />Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not a great book but killed a weekend at the Beau Revage while enjoying the view poolside.  I am looking forward to seeing what the screen play is like.

B008XG1X18|4.0|Not bad for a free app.Feeds my Pinterest addiction but could be better.Force Closes Randomly  a lot. Would be much better if I could pin from the web pn my Kindle Fire.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|This is the best studio album release from Rush in years.  Albeit, you will recognize snippets from prior Rush offerings such as Bastille Day, but that's alot of what I like about this new release.  I'm sure Rush will do the new songs justice, as usual, as they perform them live on their current tour!
B000FBJHEO|1.0|\\"There is no worse thief than a bad book,\\" a quote by Benjamin Cheever sums up Cosmopolis for me.  Unless you can fully suspend your belief system so that somehow you can be driven in your limo in NYC traffic while occasionally stopping for sex, shopping, eating, monitoring the Yen, destroying your wife's fortune, having a proctology exam in the car . . . asymmetrical findings (hmmm) this book is akin to a house invasion.  Awful.
B007TML4EI|5.0|My son and I laugh and laugh like crazy while playing this game! It's so much fun. Plus you feel like you are getting smarter while you figure out the best, most cost effective ways to defend the dummy.
0425263908|2.0|It seems that \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" has opened the door to junk reading.  Don't misunderstand me:  I've read more than my fair share of junk.  In fact, I read \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" and enjoyed it for what it was.  And I've read more than my fair share of raunchy romance novels, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that.  What bugs me, though, is to see a junk novel receive a solid 4-stars from readers, when it's worth - at best - a solid 3 stars.  Even for the genre, \\"Bared to You\\" is barely worth a solid 3-star rating.  I can only surmise that the majority of those rating it so high either don't read much, or have never read raunchy romance.<br /><br />With all of that said, if you liked \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" for the sex scenes and the turmoil of the main character, Christian Grey, then you'll likely enjoy \\"Bared to You\\" as well.  It has all of the elements of \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" without the BDSM.<br /><br />The main male character, Gideon, is very much like Christian Grey, except to say that that he's much more likeable.  There's a deep well of vulnerability below the surface of this very alpha male, and it would be a rare woman that wouldn't find herself wanting to heal those wounds.<br /><br />The main female character is a young woman as opposite of \\"50 Shades'\\" Ana as one could imagine.  In fact, she's downright annoying, immature and \\"clingy.\\"  I spent the entire book hoping to like her, but walked away feeling nothing but irritation.<br /><br />The premise of the book is similar to \\"50 Shades.\\"  A young woman fresh out of college lands a job and meets the man of her dreams, who happens to be rich and owns half of New York.  The biggest differences is that both main characters have deep wounds from their past; the young woman (who was so irritating to me that I can't even remember her name) as a former rape/child molest victim, and Gideon as...well...we're never entirely sure.<br /><br />The two can't keep their hands off of each other, so if you enjoyed the sex scenesin \\"50 Shades,\\" then you'll find that in this book, minus the BDSM.  As Christian Grey would say, it's \\"vanilla sex.\\"<br /><br />Honestly, I'm shocked that this book is at the top of the book lists.  Though it's mildly entertaining for the genre, I can think of a gazillion romance novelists that I'd rank MUCH higher than this one...some with only a little less sex included.<br /><br />The bottom line of this review is this:  If you're looking for something similar to \\"50 Shades of Grey,\\" with all of the sex you got from \\"50 Shades,\\" this might be the book for you.  But I'll warn you that the story isn't that compelling and the writing not that great.  The book is appealing, I think, strictly because people are looking for a followup to \\"50 Shades.\\"
034580404X|5.0|OMG this was the greatest trilogy that I have every read.  I can honestly say that it was well worth the money!!!
B008578PMU|3.0|The movie had a real hard time holding my wife's attention and it wasn't that great for me either.  I was hoping for more of a documentary based movie, but this was an overly glamour ized version.
034580404X|5.0|very well written...keeps you wanting to read more...great story line...couldn\\"t put it down...although erotic it keeps your attention and it is a page turner right till the end
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|I was disappointed. Didn't see it at the theater because just the general plot bothered me. Children fighting and killing other children. What made the movie worse was the adult negative influence in the game. Won't be catching the follow ons.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The book left me thinking of all the sequels that could be written.  Glad I finally got around to reading it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its really useful. and it's fun looking at all the statistics. no problems at all. and its free. so just GET it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this game. The games are original, and they can be difficult. But it does get boring. But it is still ok.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Plenty of action and story.  You do need to pay close attention to the beginning or you might be lost for awhile.  I'm looking forward to the next one.
0345803485|4.0|I just finished the first book in the series and it was a quick read, not because of the sex scenes but because of Christian's tortured character. I am middle aged but grew up in the wild 70's and believe me, there were and are 21 year olds out there who are virgins and have never masturbated. Not many for sure but a few. There are also people who are fortunate enough to have their first lover be extraordinary (or second in my case). As for the B&D-- other than the suspension system and possibly the riding crop, most of the erotica was pretty close to 9 1/2 Weeks. It was integral to the story of what made him the way he was. Anyone who has been in a relationship with someone who was abused as a very small child knows that they ARE \\"50 shades of f**ed up\\"! Anyway, a fast (skim the cheesy parts), light read with a pretty good love story-- not high brow literature, just a little entertaining escape!  ;)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How did this piece of trash become a best seller?  Is it because our least educated are so numerous?  Could anyone beyond an 8th grade education think this was worth their time to read?  I sent this garbage back and received a refund.  In other words, don't waste your time and money!!  I gave it one star but it deserves NO STARS.
B0037472PM|1.0|I ordered and paid for The Lost Coyote but never got it into my Kindle Fire. I have tried to tell you this already but to no effect so far. It appears if book is not received by customer and paid for your system does not pick this up. So how can I review a book I have not got?
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Great author and wonderfull biography . It let us now the thru about him and not all were roses ...
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very well written. Nice to read about the real life of a real hero. I couldn't put the book down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved it! A tough subject handled very well and very honestly.<br />This book contains much food for thought and discussion.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I can't believe he sold out his team.  It was very informative and kept my attention.  His account answered some of the question that haven't been answered until now.
B005DVJQHY|5.0|This is a very powerful book to read. It's designed as a correspondence course and I highly suggest you read and follow the instructions. It opens your mind and thoughts not just the first day you read, but each day if you reread the section you are working on. New things seem to appear for you to contemplate although you read it the day before.<br /><br />I highly suggest this book!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love playing this game but I feel like it needs to be updated.I remember playing a better version on my iPod before it broke
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I saw this book in the waiting room of my mother's diabetic doctor. I leafed through it and found it interesting. I checked it out from the library and was convinced to try it after reading it all. One of the main reasons for following this program is that i didnt want to suffer and pass the way my mother did. She had a heart bypass, amputation and much pain from the diabetes as well as kidney disease.<br />She was misled as many of us are by the medical profession who are now slowly being educated in the new way to healthy eating and  blood lipid testing.<br />My results were amazing. I lost 17 lbs in 3 months, felt much better after 3 days, my blood work after 3 months on this program has improved a lot. Leaving the carbs was a little hard at first but now I wouldn't go back as I feel so good. I would recommend this book for everyone. I have bought a few copies and given them away to family and friends as I feel that this is a better way to enjoy life when you are not needlessly suffering. Check out YouTube interviews with Gary Taubes and Dr. Thomas Dayspring. It is the new science. Forget what you've heard about healthy eating before. It's killing us.<br />Reading this book and \\" Wheat Belly\\" (by William Davis MD is another one that I recommend.) has given me a chance to change my future health.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This movie was so unique in it's story line. The acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet was stunning. Mark Ruffalo was really good too. I don't want to spoil the movie for someone who hasn't seen it, but if you find it a bit strange or far fetched PLEASE watch until the VERY end! It will be so worth it. Loved it!!<br />The DVD was new and came in good packaging so it came in excellent condition.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I *love* Angry Birds! I can play it for hours. My 6 yr old goddaughter loves playing it as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a game that is really cool because there are A hundred games I. it. this review is boring because I don't care
0307744434|5.0|Wonderful, quick read. I usually read classics, but wanted a break from dense reading. This book received a great review from NPR, so I gave it a shot. I absolutely loved it. It's one of those books that make you sad to finish and envious of those who are just beginning.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book steamed both on the pages and in the sheets.  A great addition to the sexy series. My husband has explored my new fun side.
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|Excellent. Well written and very understandable in some of the more technical aspects. I believe this is state-of-the-science information and very forward looking.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|My Goodness!  A great behind the scenes look into the goings on of the restaurants we all love.  I'm a TV fan of Anthony Bourdain and this takes it even further....how he started, how and what he learned.....and not just the art of cooking. He delivers with the ease, humor and confidence that we've come to love.  A fun and interesting read...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I hadn't read any King in a very long time.  As a huge fan, I though it was time to come back and boy am I glad I did.  This book is classic King and better.  There sci-fi, horror, romance, and heart pounding action.  Every character was developed so you would love them or hate them appropriately.  I'm on a mission now to read and re-read King's work, because I remember now why I fell in love with it the first time.<br /><br />Brava Mr. King.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|I'm past the first half of the book already, and I consider this great science-fiction.<br /><br />It begins a little complex (I was going to say slow, but it's actually a lot information to digest in the first few chapters, and it can be a little discouraging) but if you get past the first 3 chapters and get into the plot, you're in for a very complex drama in a dystopian future, that I find most credible.<br /><br />The characters are really complex and actually well developed. Every one of them have their very specific motivations, both circumstantial (the ones they want to have) and emotional (the ones they can't help having). The setting is greatly developed, with a lot of background that is revealed gradually to the reader.<br /><br />This is smart science fiction, with a lot of cultural, technical and \\"historical\\" background. A very good book.<br /><br />EDIT--<br /><br />So I finished reading it and forgot to add my review.<br /><br />This is a very good book. Everything I wrote before is true, but as the story progresses, it gets better.<br /><br />This is a book of capitalism versus patriotism versus pure, undiluted greed. All of this versus hope. Characters are no heroes. Almost none of them have noble motivations. Maybe one. Or two. But that's it.<br /><br />I may add that the dystopian future this people live in, leaves no room for heroics.<br /><br />It is a complex story that only gets better and better. It may have one too many twists, but none of it feels unjustified.<br /><br />I may repeat myself. A very good book.
0812993292|5.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry will soon have you traveling along beside him, sharing his memories, his sorrow, his accidental noble quest, his rediscovery of life - and death. You will come to know, as you journey along with him, Harold, his wife, his family, his friends, you will become one of the people who briefly share his life. You will find yourself caring deeply in his venture even as you question whether it can end in success. This book was a surprise for me as I picked it up by accident and had no expectations for it. As it turned out, this is a novel I won't forget. Much like the Leisure Seekers, this story will wrap itself around your heart and the characters will become so well known to you that you feel a part of their lives. Unable to put it down, I read most of it during the night when I should have been sleeping and couldn't wait for the day's tasks to be done so I could dive back into the tale. I am left with feelings of sadness and joy. Mostly, I am left with gratitude for the author's sharing this adventure with us. I am most anxious to see what else Rachel Joyce comes up with
0345803485|5.0|A triangle of events that keeps u interest n can't put it down book . Detailed sex descriptions. This is a excellent book for women or men I actually had my husband read some of the pages n let's say it was worth it!! Lol  Do understand some is harsher than the norm if u know snm but  its not all hard core most of it is pleasure to the womans body. Exciting read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love to play it with my daughter. we have a great time together. had to switch my kindle and had to start over but its still fun
B007UXSPK2|4.0|If you are willing to suspend your disbelief during implausable, slightly over the top action sequences, you'll find this an entertaining action movie. (These sequences are, however, guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat). The movie is bouyed by moments of pithy humor, often provided by Ethan Hunt's British team member, Simon Pegg. Better than MI-2 & 3; as good as, if not better than MI-1. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton play strong supporting roles as the remaining members of Hunt's team. Michael Nyqvist is a worthy adversary/villain in his role as Kurt Hendricks. The film currently scores a 94% \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating on the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm still reading book 2,this book really shocked me.I really did not expect things to turn around.You don't want to stop reading it.
B008EQIK90|1.0|I rented this clunker from Netflix and only made it about 35 minutes or so into the film before I had to stop watching.  Agggh!  It was just terrible!  Mainly it was due to bad acting; it seemed as if everyone was just reading from the cue cards.  Dumb plot with corny tired old lame jokes (done poorly).  I am so glad I only wasted a small amount of time and just a little money on this low rent excuse of a movie.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This is a very addictive game, you have to think strategies to out Matt the spiders. Each level get harder and smarter spiders. You will have lots of fun playing this.
B0026772N8|5.0|I have loved this book since I read it the first time when I was in my late teens.  I've read it every several years, and my copy has endured multiple moves, flood and fire, making it time for a new copy.  Practical, fun, light hearted spiritual sense.
630469654X|5.0|I had a copy of this on VHS.  I loved the story and thought all of the actors were wonderful.  I had not been able to see it for years and thought I woud see if Amazon had it.  I am so glad you did.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|LOVE the widget! Also seeing the remaining time broken down by activity so I know just how long my battery has left.
B006MW3VGA|1.0|Not what I had expected.  Thought that  I was getting Episode 1 od Season 2 of Downton Abbey. 1.Thankfully I got it for free!!
B0090EIILU|5.0|This movie was very funny. We watched it a couple of times before our rent time ran out. It's a must watch!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Tells the truth. The persistant, consistant action over a long time equals success. Thank You Darren Hardy. Get the book (Kindle) and Audio and listen to it often. It will change your life!.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the whole series. I have not finished Mockingjay but so far it has turned out to be very good.
0345803493|5.0|It was great! I got my book in two day from I when my order went in. It wasI exactly what I was expecting! Great service.
B00004W50Z|4.0|While a good album it is nowhere near on the level as \\"Music From Big Pink\\" let alone their previous release \\"The Band.\\"<br /><br />Still, if you're an anal enough record collector I would suppose you should get this to fill out your \\"Band\\" collection; it's certainly better than their next album, \\"Cahoots\\" which has a majority of four star reviews and deservedly so.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|The game is fun and probably be a lot more fun if the vehicle upgrades were not so many coins. Its hard to get very far without a car with better handling.
B00004W50T|4.0|Most reviewers have given this five stars; I think four (or perhaps 4.5) would be more accurate.<br /><br />It's a very fine album and one of the things that's so great about it is that this band (or should I just say \\"The Band\\") is clearly on the upswing here as demonstrated by their next release \\"[[ASIN:B00004W510 The Band]].\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007QDM552|5.0|Soulful, gritty, foot stomp'in and rock'in beautiful music....Just buy it. Listen...then you'll know. I am so looking forward to hearing more from this band. Big things coming, folks! :)
B008133MDK|5.0|In a world where television and cinema are producing more failures than not, Sherlock is the greatest breath of fresh air I have ever taken in. Benedict Cummberbatch is his own kind of genius and brings life to Sherlock that no one else on earth could manage. Martin Freeman is the epitome of friendship and, frankly, quite handsome. Interest in the upcoming \\"the Hobbit\\" will no doubt be roused because of his performance alone.<br /><br />If you are considering watching this great series, consider no more. Watch one episode and I guarantee that you'll go from viewer to victim of addiction.
0596007124|5.0|Unlike other OO design books this Head First design patterns book is very easy to read in spite of its 600+ pages. One of the few software books that I read end to end.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. fast read and easy to understand.<br />2. excellent examples to explain patterns<br />3. Covers the most required ones and this lays a good foundation instead of your getting confused with numerous patterns.<br /><br />I can't think of any cons.<br /><br />A must read for all OO software developers.
034580404X|5.0|Couldnt Put the book down!!! Very addictive,sexy novel. I'm so glad I bought all 3 of them at the same time!!!
B008602KQI|3.0|I hope the rest of the series follow the books more closely. I am waiting for the next movie in the hopes that it will be better.
B007ZH9P0C|2.0|This song was great when I first heard it sang by Madonna in the Barcelona concert in July 2012. I love it in the CD, but the remixes are quite repetitive and terribly plain. The instruments sound so badly in these remixes! Was this CD done over a night? What a huge dissapointment! There is total lack of instrumental creativity. I am losing faith in Madonna´s remixes, which are getting worse and worse.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|best book that i have read on the second book cant wait to read the third one the book is great
B006P96PAO|1.0|Pretty wooden acting, stereotyped villains, some effort at action when called for, but otherwise, just a commercial for a particular belief system. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but just don't expect it to be more than that.
B0073QGIPA|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is my favorite show ever! This episode is very entertaining and filled with some cliff hangers as usual!
B0086700CM|5.0|kids will be very entertain during this game very addicting and for adults if you just wanna kill time like waiting for your flight I think that this will kill time very well and there's a foam to make it not pointless so I would absouletly recommend temple run but not the other version it s a waste to me
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book is Ana and Christian coming together to make things workout. I love all the twists and turns. Did not expect this book to go that way but I loved it!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have been \\"off my read\\" for a while and purchased \\"The Best of Me\\" for my Kindle to mainly have something to read while bicycling at the gym.  I had read other books by Nicholas Sparks and this one was not a disappointment.  I couldn't put it down.  As in all his books, I found a love story intertwined with researched locale, individual journeys, and an unexpected ending that I didn't see coming~~I would recommend this to anyone looking for not only an entertaining read, but also a thought provoking view into my own journey.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider solitaire! I play this game all the time! So much fun to play when you are bored!
1609611543|5.0|This is the most informative book on diet in years.  All of it is very well researched, foot noted, and just makes sense.  I have recommended this book to numerous friends.  May be a bit technical to some people, but I like the science.  Get it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Look either you liked the books or you did'nt.I myself loved every word (right or wrong)in these books. Why did you pick up the book in the first place? Someone said it was good? Yes it is. All the girls in the office read them? And loved them.<br />I think christian and Ana were perfect for each other. And at what age do you have to be to be a millonaire ( I did'nt know there was an age limit). Besides he could have won the lottery :)- These books had everything from action to love and everything in between.<br />I am hoping EL James writes it from Christian's side.<br />I love the fact she did not write it in the third person.<br />Remember it's only as good as your imagination will allow it to be.
B008BIN9EW|3.0|UniWar HD is like a watered-down version of Advance Wars.  It's interesting, but matches last too long and the units (and factions) are very poorly balanced.  The best strategy to win is usually to pick one good unit from whatever faction you're playing and just make a ton of it.  It renders it rather dry.  Some ideas from it are cool - such as repairing units at the cost of a turn, and using supporting units to speed such recovery - but the game as a whole feels like it's missing something.  The campaign is also jumpy and rather confusing.  You fight all three sides of a war, and fight many key battles twice.  Winning them twice leads to paradoxes, and renders the game lacking of any canon \\"ending\\".  If it's free, it's not a bad time-waster.  I'd never pay money for it, though.
B0054DFIGY|5.0|Great instrument, great voice, great songs make for a classic vinyl for anyone who appreciates these qualities: Ukulele, smooth voices and relaxing music.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Loved this movie!  Toddler grandson to 80+ Great Grandma were captivated with this wildly vibrant colored story about a land without trees.  It tells how it happened because of the greed of people and their disregard for preserving nature...and how a young boy goes the extra step to correct a wrong that everyone else has failed to fight.<br /><br />Artfully produced it tells a powerful story that even a child can understand.  A must see for everyone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Perfect app for Kindle fire users. Or any device its available on. So simple and intuitively created. I wouldn't change a thing. good job, just get it and you'll use it A Lot.  what did I do before it? I don't know! lol the kids even use it on their tablets to guage a trips worth of charge on the battery.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Loved where's my water! Love where's my Perry!! New puzzles,  new fun!  Can't wait for more levels! Totally worth the $.99!!!
B000FC2L1E|3.0|Fantastic author, but book one and two were so fantastic, that I'm a little disappointed with book three. I had a terrible time putting down her first two books, but it hasn't been the same with this one.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|the Digital copy was amazing, I dowloaded it to my kindle that first day! The dvd however, was a little bit of a disappointment. There is a point where the movie stops and will not play anymore, and when it does, its about 20 minutes further then it should be. I can't afford to buy another one so my digital will have to do. I got it when i was supposed to and the digital copy is awesome! Just wish my dvd worked too..
B008OOYALE|3.0|Its a fun game but the dragons are expensive. I can barely keep the coins I get from my habitats. also I play this on my kindle fire and I cant see the quests. what gives? fix that stuff and this will be a 5 star review instead next time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is simple, straightforward, but lot's of fun. The addition of added gadgets by earning coins in the game gives it a lot of replay.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked the story very much as I do most of Nicholas Sparks' books. The storyline was similar to Sleeping with the Enemy. Not sure I can buy in to the part where she \\"discovers\\" who her neighbor, Jo, really is but all in all it's a nice love story.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It grabs you from the start! Wondering about what is going on. In the end you say \\"oh ya that makes sense\\". Well written. Will buy more of his books from Amazon!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I absolutely love this app! Great time killer, and tons of replayability! I would recommend this app to anyone. Controls are simple, and there are almost no bugs. No OpenFeint or ScoreLoop. I believe this is the best free app on the market.
0525953728|2.0|The whole book is an exercise in propaganda, attempting to flesh out a story that never happened.<br /><br />It's a fish story.<br /><br />Gov: I caught a 90 inch walleye.<br />People: Wow, let's see it!<br />G: I threw it back into the water.<br />P: Really? OK, show us some pictures.<br />G. Um... OK.<br /><br />After a little stalling, the gov. shows you some crap that is obviously photoshopped.<br /><br />P: Hm... This doesn't really look like a 90 inch walleye.  Got any better pics?<br />G: What? Are you trying to say you don't believe me?  Look, I can tell you all about the boat and the lake and the cabin, what I was wearing that day and what my wife cooked etc. Yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />All of the negative reviews accusing the author of treason or betraying trust etc., they would be perfectly on-target if any OBL killing had actually taken place.  The author is totally in the clear if the book is fiction, and it is.<br /><br />\\"How can he be allowed to publish this and give away secrets?\\" ask many reviewers.  The simple answer is that it's a work of fiction.<br /><br />Don't get all upset.  Just ask to see the proof that anybody at all killed OBL.  And when the answer is,\\"We'll get back to you on that,\\" you have your answer.<br /><br />Think about how many lies went in to selling you the war in Iraq: mobile weapons labs, yellow cake from Niger, aluminum tubes, meeting in Prague.  I hope you're aware that NO weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq after the invasion. Now we have a new president, but it's the same government.  Lies, lies and LIES.<br /><br />I'm glad we haven't gone into Iran yet, because they're waving around the same kind of transparent lies again. If we do go, it will be based on lies.  Please let the gov. know that we are not going to accept their lying again, and maybe a whole lot of unnecessary killing can be avoided.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've heard many interviews by Dr. William Davis, and finally bought the book. He offers a clear view of why gluten intolerances and autoimmune diseases are on the rise, why gluten should never be part of your diet, and a plethora of resources, websites and recipes to help you on your gluten free path. As someone who has celiac disease, this was not news, but his history of wheat and examples of modern medicine's refusal to acknowledge its damage was an eye opener. Going gluten free will not help you lose weight if you substitute gluten free junk food for the junk you ate before. But if you follow Dr. Davis's suggestions and eat a low carb, high fat, moderate protein diet, 100% gluten free, you can't help but return to a healthy weight. Not sure you can do it? Find a partner, someone as committed as you want to be, and get to it! Dr. Davis's book will guide you on your journey.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good, basic version of solitaire. Can't beat the price.<br />Decent graphics, movement,  options. Most ads are skippable, at least so far.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is so amazing. I was completely ingrossed in the book the entire time. I read this book in two days i had such a hard time putting it down. I can not wait for the next book to come out. From the the first chapter i could tell this was going to be a great story. I loved how the author had you guessing with what was going to happen next. this book is a must read
B003BM374K|3.0|Cute This movie was good for a quiet Friday with my little dancer. Thought there would be more dancing in it though.
B008XG1X18|4.0|slow to open but overall I have no complaints. Just like the website and easy to maneuver. I use at least 3 times a day.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|This book offers a great introduction to anyone interested in learning about the Raspberry Pi. The coverage is fairly comprehensive, starting with a description of the Raspberry Pi and getting it setup, followed by Linux Administration and using the Raspberry Pi for a number of different purposes. These range from using the Raspberry Pi as a media centre, to a development platform and finally for hardware hacking with the GPIO port.<br /><br />I found the Python and Hardware hacking sections particularly useful as these are the main things I want to play with on the Raspberry Pi.<br /><br />All in all, a worthwhile purchase. If you are a Raspberry Pi owner this is a recommended purchase!
B005K17RU0|5.0|good app i like all the features i think it is very helpful when i am getting ready to go to my high school because then i know what to wear for the either cold or warm weather. very good i would totally recommend this app to anyone and everyone.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Would appeal to teenagers like most movies these days. Adult characters are parodies and stereotypes. The story is interesting but the dialog is stilted and clumsy and preachy.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time. I did have some issues loading the video at the time I watched it. Other than that it was great.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Bottom 99% of screen is ad.  Just enough screen left to see half a line of video description.  I do not recomend
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Best app to help you relax. Must have if you have trouble sleeping or if u need a stress relief
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The follow up to Fall of Giants by Ken Follet was worth the wait. It is every bit as intriguing,  descriptive and historically accurate as its predessesor. I love the way he intricately weaves the lives of the characterers in a cohesive and easy to follow storyline while jumping all over the globe to describe how each monumental world event effects them as individuals.  Two thumbs up !  A must  read for lovers of historical fiction.  I can hardly wait for book three!
B001GH5HN6|5.0|This song has been played on the radio so frequently that I would expect many American males of my age to think it describes where we ended up better than turn on, tune in, drop out. So many times somebody was assigned our case and if we had a house that got cluttered it seemed like we were living in a rummage sale. Sometimes I bought things that my wife had donated to a big church sale because I was the one who wanted to use it. That verse of Fortunate Son is about pretending to be poor. When the taxman comes to the door, the house looks like a rummage sale. I am living with my stuff at the age of 65 and my next move is likely to take me where my stuff cannot go. I would forget about most things if I did not see them sometimes. Today I thought of this song without seeing it until I felt like this is as important as the books I read.
B0090EIILU|4.0|Pretty funny movie. The jokes are a little raunchy, but it was a funny premise.  Irony is always funny with politics.
B00866H7SS|1.0|I have just finished reading the 4th book in this \\"TRILOGY\\" and if I could go back I would and save my $34.28.    Seriously??  After 4 expensive books the story has only progressed a few months - A FEW MONTHS!!! Filled with boring mundane day to day details that are of no consequence. You have to ask WTF is going on in Sylvia Day's mind when there is NO RESOLUTION to ANY of the story. A money grabbing exercise I think. I will NOT buy any more because at this rate it would take another 4 books just to get to the December (vague but no spoiler) considering they met in June, this whole story is laughable.  I urge you to seriously think about missing this WHOLE series.
B008CP93S0|5.0|This movie really surprised me.  It was a lot funnier than I expected.  I laughed hysterically at some parts.  Great acting and funny surprises.
B008XG1X18|5.0|No problems on my kindle fire usually, but just before I started this review it froze up on me and I had to reboot.  Normally a good little app.
B008602KQI|5.0|First time I saw it, I had not yet read the books and I loved it.  The second time was after I read the book and I saw so much more in the story.  I think it is very well done and follows the book well.  Everyone I know who has seen it really liked it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Its great the way it explains so simply how to do it then offers you more support if needed. It's so simple and so helpful! I love the way you can highlight, underline, add special notes to your document!  It's perfect for me!!
0790729725|4.0|Movie wonderful and compelling.  DVD quality a little suspect.  Great actors putting forth a very believable movie.  You will have to overlook and tolerate language to be immersed in a very good movie.  Violence, corruption, greed, passion is part of this lifestyle so expect it in the movie.
0545302862|5.0|Our Percy Jackson adventure actually started accidentally when my son found The Battle of the Labyrinth used at a local bookstore for a dollar.  He insisted that we read it aloud as a family starting on a Friday evening.  Sunday evening came, and we were finished with the book and knew instantly that we had to get all of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.<br /><br />Judging by the main characters and their ages, it is easy to say that the target audience is suppose to be young-adult; however, I'm in my mid 30's and have been pleasantly surprised by how much I've enjoyed the series.  I cannot stress enough how excellent this series is for sharing time as a family together, passing the book from person to person so they can read a chapter aloud.<br /><br />Beyond being a great story though, I can say without question that these books are also educational.  Both of my children have become very interested in ancient Greek culture and it's counterpart, ancient Roman.  When one of the chapters in the five books makes a reference to a Greek myth that they are not familiar with, as soon as the chapter is over they were either questioning my wife or I about it before we could continue.<br /><br />Also, another huge plus to this series is that unlike other novels, there is not anything that I would call questionable for a child to hear.<br /><br />Now, the humor on the other hand...I cannot recall the last time I've laughed so much, or so hard, due to comedy in a book.  Even some of the chapter names will cause a person to crack a smile.  But it's clean humor, no adult innuendo whatsoever.<br /><br />All in all, I would give the books and the entire series more than five stars, if Amazon allowed for a higher rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE this book. It's a futuristic story! I've read it seven times…LITERALLY!!! If yoh are looking for a thrilling page turner… well read this book!
034580404X|5.0|Books in new condition!  I could not put them down. Read all three in 7 days!!  Easy read, twists and turns and not at all what I initially thought they would be about. A true love story with interesting extras!!  :0). I sent them on to a cousin and she can't put them down!!!!
B0083F5J7S|4.0|I love the previous CD that they put out. This one I like and, although it is growing on me, I haven't reached the love stage yet. It seems that all the songs have the same beat and sound. In my opinion there is not the variety that we enjoyed on the Hands All Over Me CD.I could also do without the vulgarity on the CD version of Phone Call. But that's just me.
0345803493|5.0|I think this was my favorite of the trilogy. While there were still hot steamy sex scenes; there was far more chatacter development in this one.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|After reading the reviews I thought it must be good. WRONG! I must be on another planet then these other viewers.<br />horrible acting & 1 hr too long. What a waste of time!!!
B007XNAOS0|2.0|This album contains pretty decent musicianship but overall considering the majority of the reviews its being very much overrated. This album keeps poppin up in the recommendations when viewing other bands on amazon such as Buzzov-en, Eyehategod, Weedeater, Sleep, Electric Wizard, Acid Bath, and Bongzilla so comparing those bands to Baroness is a joke if youre new and havent listened to those bands please go listen to them and see if you still think this is a 5 star album.
0525953728|5.0|OBL had to die. But nobody could find the SOB. It took ten long years with hundreds of intelligence people looking under every rock in Pakistan to find the SOB, but once they found OBL, they did what needed to be done.<br /><br />It was overdue.<br /><br />Mark Owen tells his riveting tale and how he acquired the necessary physical as well as emotional characteristics that is required to take a terrorist down - in his own bedroom.<br /><br />Owen was born and raised in a remote town somewhere in the badlands of Alaska. He was the middle kid, sandwiched between his two sisters. He had a good mom and dad and he learned how to shoot a gun before he could spell. He was a wonderful kid, and grew up to be a remarkable young soldier.<br /><br />Owen did not release any secret details of our kick-ass American Navy Seal military tactics or military secrets that were not already released to the public by the media.<br />He tells it as it went down; the dirty deed to kill the madman responsible for 9/11.<br />We are coming up on the 11th anniversary of that horrible day,when terrorists crashed planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan. Over 3,000 innocent people were slaughtered that day. and the nation was stunned and wept. Then the American flags came out - millions hung the flag....and we as a nation came together.<br /><br />It didn't take long, but our president at the time, President George W. Bush warned that vengence might be God's, but the USA also will exact vengence. On our own time and our own determination. He was angry and so was I.<br /><br />I am so happy Prez Obama approved the plan; Operation Neptune.<br /><br />I was surprised when Owen states that he does not care for the President today. His team met President Obama after the killing of OBL, but he gave a speech that was just wall-to-wall cliches. Obama also invited Owen and his team to hangout at the White House and drink some beers, but it was just an empty promise.<br />To this day, Owen never stepped foot inside the White House, which I think is really bogus!<br /><br />Anyhow - Owen tells the tale in typical military dialgoue - he is very dry and straightforward with his usage of English. He is not a discriptive type of writer; his  writing style is quite minimal and spartan. He doesn't dwell on his emotions very long - he is very basic in his thought processes, which is the type of personality that is best suited to being a soldier, one would imagine.<br /><br />The book had a ton of abbreviations - which drove me crazy - because there is no glossary in the back to look them up and know what the heck Owen is referring to. He never spelled-out the abbreviation either, so that component of the book really annoyed me, but it wasn't going to stop me from reading<br />what is perhaps the BEST DANG BOOK in the universe that describes modern warfare<br />and what any cowardly, third world terrorist should expect to get when he or she<br />decides he's going to mess with the United States of Amercia!<br /><br />May this fine book serve as a badass warning to all terrorists.<br />YOU WILL BE DEALT WITH!!!<br />Give peace your undying support!!!<br /><br />This is truly a great book!!! People are picking it up and reading it by the millions!!!<br />God speed and best of luck to Mr Mark Owen.<br /><br />May God bless you and your team for the heroic efforts you did in order to do the deed.<br /><br />The world has become a safer place because men like Mark Owen exist, who are willing to dispose of the world's biggest bullies!!! I loved this book and so did lots of other people.<br /><br />I got mine at COSTCO, and it's selling like hotcakes!!!!!day, Owen never stepped foot inside the White House, which I think is really bogus!<br /><br />Anyhow - Owen tells the tale in typical military dialgoue - he is very dry and straightforward with his usage of English.

0446195529|2.0|As a long- time fan of Mr. Baldacci, I was initially delighted to see the \\"gang\\" all together again...or at least I thought they were going to be all together. To my disappointment, it turns out they were minimally involved and heaven help a reader unfamiliar with the Camel Club back story.<br /><br />Whereas most reviewers in the mystery genre applaud twists and turns, here they became annoying ...going on and on...back and forth. To say I couldn't put the book down doesn't translate into the usual plaudits; instead I couldn't leave it too long or I would lose track of the characters...not to mention the alphabet soup of agencies.<br /><br />It was so convoluted that at some point I stopped caring which evildoer was responsible, and the body count was alarming given the lack of progress. All the \\"aha\\" moments happened in the last portion of the book and weren't particularly satisfying.<br /><br />Still better than most of the indie e-books, but I had hoped for better.
0307891372|5.0|This book is so big that it's ridiculous to easily travel through, much like Skyrim. But it has everything you need. It's a good source of all the quests and other items/places/little info pieces. I would highly recommend for the game player who can't avoid finishing anything but also would recommend to stay away; you will play for the rest of your life.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This one was cool as long as you get it without paying for it! No ads so thats the best part about it but they still want you to pay for power ups! So it's up to you if you want this DL.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Although a little slow to begin with this book certainkly became a gripping tale. After seeing the movie on an interstate flight when I was less than half way through the book, I was wondering whether it was worthwhile to continue reading the book.  I am glad I did and will now buy the sequels as the movie certainly did not do the book justice.
B0014CQNTK|4.0|This was a great buy. I've wanted this movie for a while and I'm very happy with the one I purchased!
1451627297|4.0|11/22/63 I knew I would be crying before I even started reading the book.  I don't have ESP but I was sure how it would turn out.  I have read it twice now and I am thinking about reading it a third time.  Stephen King captures the times, the feelings and creates characters I grew to care about. I recommnend it. It is not an easy read. There were two specific places were I cried: when Jackie called him and when he danced with Sadie the last time.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|So simple and entertaining it is genius.  Nearly impossible to put down.  I'm bummed I waited so long to read this.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was such a riveting, well-written book until the last few pages.  I had to read the ending 3 times because it was so lame.  It was as if the author just thought oh well, time to end it and bam!  Very disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Suzanne Collins writes a believable world in which she does not try to answer every question, but let's the plot play out naturally. The reader finds themselves coming back again and again in their mind to chew on what they have experienced in the book. That is the trademark of well written. Good Job.
B008476HBM|5.0|A wonderful tale that shows the importance of upbringing , character and morality.  Ms. Bennet deals with the issues central to life in the 19th century; manners, education and marriage.  Ms. Bennet and Mr. Darcy allow us to hope that there is hope through love and understanding.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is brilliantly written; a real page turner.  70% done with it and will look for other titles from this author
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This was my first Gladwell book, and so far my favorite.  He covers a lot of interesting areas, although occasionally falls short of explaining them fully.
B007BVNW10|5.0|This show is pretty sweet.  The book is awesome too.  I can't wait to see the second season after I finish the second book.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|I got this as FAOTD based on all the 5 star reviews,  but after a very frustrating time trying to decipher how to even operate this game based on the poorly written text-only tutorial, I've decided to give up.  I have even tried sequentially tapping every item on the screen to get ANY sort of reaction from the app to no avail.<br /><br />The only response I have gotten is from tapping menu bars,  or the check mark / go back buttons at the bottom of the screen.  Most games that don't have good tutorials are intuitive enough that they can be figured out by playing with the screen a bit to gauge responses - NOT so with this game!  Unsure if this is a KFire issue or just a poorly designed app by a dev that is too lazy to provide a halfway-decent tutorial, but apparently not too lazy to submit PLENTY of faux 5-star reviews.<br /><br />I was willing to give this a try as FAOTD,  but it is too frustrating to suss out from the rather lengthy text only directions and apparently only have a largely non-responsive app wasting space on my library shelf.  I would be very upset and angry if I had wasted $4.99 on this.  I only give it one star because zero is not an option.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love, Love, Love this show!  Can get enough of these actors.  I only hate having to wait a year to see it.<br />Can't wait for Season 5 this week.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a great time killer but on some of the games the controls are neer impossible to use and getting the upgarde will start u over
0385341008|2.0|At the time of writing this review 1659 other readers have voiced their opinions and the vast majority rate this book as a 5 star. While I don't think it deserves a 1 star rating, I'm trying to figure out why all of these folks loved the book so much.  I found the \\"good German - bad German\\"  and the sudden changes from tragedy to comedy unsettling; the characters seemed artificial and the canonization of Elizabeth contrived. Having visited Guernsey Island some years ago, the story of the German Occuapation was interesting but I wondered how realistic it really was.  I'm clearly in the minority on this one - but it my book its overrated.
B006362ZR6|3.0|Not The Fray's best work to date.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the more upbeat sound this album has compared their previous albums but, unfortunately the music is accompanied by some not-so-great and often clichéd lyrics. It sounds like the band fell victim to trying to outdo themselves and ended up trying too hard. In my opinion, Heartbeat is really the only great song on the album, while \\"1961\\", \\"I can Barely Say\\" and \\"Munich\\" are at least worth listening too.<br /><br />Still looking forward to their future releases, though.
B00005KK4P|3.0|I'm firmly in the camp of the two- and three-star reviewers with respect to this symphonic cycle. Bohm and the BPO do shine in the two mature works, Symphonies 8 and 9. These works can be played either as early romantic extensions of the classical period or as larger edifices that presage the likes of Bruckner. I can go with either style of interpretation, depending on my mood, and Bohm's approach is certainly closer to the latter: The \\"Unfinished\\" Symphony is played large; while the Ninth is measured and stately, with occasional tempo fluctuations that make it stumble once or twice. Nonetheless, both are solid modern instrument \\"big band\\" versions, and you can't go wrong with them if that's the kind of interpretation you seek. Less successful, however, are the earlier symphonies. Here I have to side with those who find Bohm at times slow and ponderous. One of the worst offending moments is the minuet of the First Symphony, which is almost capable of replacing the dancing elephant in Saint-Saen's Carnival of the Animals. This grand approach to Schubert, which works in the last two symphonies, seriously mars the earlier six. There is some good news, though: The numbers 8 and 9 were released together on DG's Eloquence label, so if you can find a copy you can have the part of this cake that's worth eating.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|My LifeProof case has proven to be a good case so far.  I have only utilized the underwater function in my sink without any problems, but I am now less anxious to take my phone out to the lake on the weekends.  The pink case has a nice tight fit compared to my husbands black case which does not fit as tightly around his phone.  I have no problems with any functions on my phone as well with this case.
B000G7599Y|5.0|I've just put down my five stars on this one, and I put them down with feeling. Bohm's interpretation of the Jupiter Symphony has long been one of my all time favorites, possessing a dash that his version with the Vienna Philharmonic completely lacked. The other mature works come off equally well, and although one might wonder if a full modern orchestra could do justice to the juvenile works, what with \\"period instrument\\" sensibilities to the fore in recent decades, the fact is that Bohm and the BPO perform those youthful compositions with the same verve with which they invigorate the Jupiter. This is the best modern instrument Mozart symphonic cycle, period.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is one of the best books that i have read in a long time.  I would recommend this book to anyone even guys.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a great game I'm happy I got it you should try it as well it is worth your while I promise
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The story was fine the acting resonably good, character development could have been improved, occasionally had disconnect as there were quite a few characters to keep track of. Overall it was fine. Recently saw Trout Fishing in Yemen and was reminded what really good acting was like.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Easy to learn and play.  Makes you think and plan to get the A, but it is not so hard that you give up.  Good game.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|The shipping was quick and the product was great! And for the movie well it's not the same as the original but it's still good
B009329ZF2|2.0|Great special effects and a horrible story line! This movie was terrible and I want my money back plus more for pain and suffering!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great calculator, works perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  Thanks to the developers. The price is right.  Never a problem to use.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have always enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' books, but have not read one for awhile.  I will order some more of his novels now.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|This is simply put the most compelling Batman drama period. The fact that is animate does not take away from the story. Purchase and enjoy.
B005Z28M58|5.0|A FAN OF THIS SHOW SINCE THE BEGINNING, THIS COMPLETES MY COLLECTION OF EACH SEASON AND I CAN WATCH FAVORITE MOMENTS WHENEVER
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I don't know why this movie received bad reviews.  I loved it.  Classic Johnny Depp.  I'll watch it again and again.
B00684J49U|5.0|I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS SERIES SINCE THE BEGINNING AND GETTING EACH SEASON AS IT COMES OUT ON DVD. GLAD TO ADD THIS TO MY COLLECTION
B00127RAJY|5.0|I thought this would be wack, but I absolutely loved it and strted shredding ounds as soon as I started. of course with diet added to the combination. Awesome.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|The author is probably the best among the many people offering buddhist teachings in America today because her language is rooted in practical experience, humor and complete compassion for the realities of modern life. This book is full of warmth and brilliance. You'll read it over and over again
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I read about 1/4 of the book and stopped.  It is written from the perspective of a 14 year old boy.  Lot's of drivel about gay teenagers, drama club, menstrual cycles, dry humping in the backseat, etc....  Just wasn't worth my time.
B00499QUK2|5.0|The invigorated twist to the new Sherlock Holmes proved insightful embracing the same baffling brillance as contained in the older series.  Sherlock is still the smartest guy in the room bar none.  You will watch the series again and again to detect what you missed in the first playing of each and every segment.  Love it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it works very good and it is very usefull, the app is made specially for kindle fire. I use this app in my phone, Mac and now in the kindle
1439102430|5.0|When the body of a newborn is found stuffed under a bathroom vanity in a dingy Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec apartment, the call goes out to forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan. As the Quebec police search the apartment, two more tiny bodies, mummified, are found hidden. With no sign of the mother, Brennan and detective Andrew Ryan are determined to track down the elusive mother and find justice for the little ones. When they travel to the town where she lived before Saint-Hyacinthe, yet another tiny body is found, and everyone is frantic to find the woman. When the trail leads to the Northlands of Canada, things start to get tangled with other crimes, all connected to the family of the mother. As people keep dying, Brennan becomes enmeshed in a fight for her life, as well ass stopping the murderers from stealing an innocent woman's only faamily legacy. Add in an obnoxious ex lover or two, and things become sticky. Can Brennan find the mother before things get out of control? Can she stop the crooks from bilking everyone involved? Can she stay alive long enough to solve this latest case to the satisfaction of all concerned?<br /><br />I want to say, I have been a big fan of Kathy Reichs and her Temperance Brennan books from the very first one. I have enjoyed watching as Temperance has grown, using her brains to get ahead, not caring for all the red tape and maneuvering so prevalent in police procedure. The glimpses into lab procedure and the historic desciptions of the Northern Diamond Rush are wonderful, and I was surprised to know that Canada is a large producer of diamonds. The research here is flawless and fascinating, and I was inspired to read more about it.<br /><br />Temperance Brennan is her usual efficient and capable scientist here, but she is also a mother, and feels a bit of sympathy for these poor abandoned babies. And she is determined to track down the mother and bring her to justice for these four innocents lost too soon. One other thing about Brennan, is her ability to see past the surface, and as she learns more about the missing Annaliese (or Amy/Alma/Alice), she discovers a simple girl, unable to understand life, and scared for her life.<br /><br />There are the usual cast of supporting characters here, if not present, then at least mentioned throughout: Brennan's ex-husband Pete, her daughter Katy, who throws Brennan a real curve ball of a surprise, and the staff at Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de medecine legale in Montreal, Brennan's Canadian base. Add in two former lovers, Andrew Ryan and Oliver `Ollie' Hasty of the Edmonton police, a man from Brennan's days at Quantico, and the atmoshere gets tense at times. But in spite of her past with these two, Brennan is all buiness here, as she gets caught up in the chase to catch the killer or killers before they catch up to her.<br /><br />All in all, this book kept me up reading long after I should have been sleeping, with edge of my seat danger and tangled webs of deceit around every corner. Kathy Reichs once again proves why I have followed Temperance Brennan on her adventures, and satisfies one more time.<br /><br />Originally posted at LAS Mystery Reviewsnan, is her ability to see past the surface, and as she learns more about the missing Annaliese (or Amy/Alma/Alice), she discovers a simple girl, unable to understand life, and scared for her life.<br /><br />There are the usual cast of supporting characters here, if not present, then at least mentioned throughout: Brennan's ex-husband Pete, her daughter Katy, who throws Brennan a real curve ball of a surprise, and the staff at Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de medecine legale in Montreal, Brennan's Canadian base.

B004SC8XHI|5.0|Truly enjoyed the music in addition to the liner notes that was included. Interesting the connection between the Beatles and Booker T.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I have read several biographies on Bob Marley. So a video biography was very appealing to me. I loved all the  interview clips of Bob. That is something that I have not seen alot of. Also loved the commentary from Rita, Ziggy, Cedella, and the various people that worked with or knew Bob. I thought there was a perfect mix of interviews and performances. The best part for me, something that I haven't heard alot about before, was the last few months of his life. I think the movie covers that well.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Great acting as always from Penelope, but the film is also directed very well, giving everyone a better chance to shine- great film
