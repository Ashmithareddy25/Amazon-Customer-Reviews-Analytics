B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is one of the funniest, raunchiest, sexyist, series I have ever watched on HBO. All of the characters are extremely entertaining. The opening music alone is enough to make me get up and dance! If \\"sex-on-a-stick Jason Stackhouse doesn't make you want to \\"clutch your pearls\\", then you just need some therapy!
B000002ADT|5.0|If you do not have this album..get it NOW. This is one of the high points of 20th century American Music-people 100 years from now will be listening to this music and place it next to composers like Mozart, Bach, etc.    Believe me..just get the CD, pop it in, sit back in a comfortable chair and listen..you will hear perfection.    Plus..the Cd is very inexpensive..for $8, even if you don't like it, it did not cost much.
0307454541|5.0|I've been reading some of the reviews here and I can't believe what I'm reading! This book is neither bloated nor overblown and it's absolutely wonderful that there are so many characters; it creates a rich reading experience. And besides, there is a family tree one can refer to. This book is highly interesting and engaging. I found that after the first couple of character introductory chapters that the mystery to be solved kept me wanting to keep reading! I enjoyed the complexity of the plot and enjoyed that Larsson takes his time and presents a story with depth. If you want a fast moving book filled with action this book isn't for you. But if you want a thoughtful book that deals with moral issues, has two very interestingly different protagonists (Blomkvist and Salander), has a humdinger of a mystery and yes, does have some intense action, then pick up a copy today!!
B002IKLZZY|5.0|The scene remains embedded deep into every movie maven's mind: Man and woman fighting for their lives while straddling the faces of four presidents at Mt. Rushmore.<br />  North By Northwest: Film frenzy indeed.<br />  Leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to come up with such a brilliant bit of motion-picture making.<br />  For those who watch too much Fox News: Cary Grant, in his fourth outing with Hitchcock, plays Manhattan ad man Roger Thornhill, who is abducted, plunged into the world of spies and counterspies, framed for murder and chased in the famous crop-duster sequence. Eva Marie Saint plays his love interest Eve Kendall, and yes, the final train-plunging-through-the-tunnel scene is a visual metaphor for exactly what you think.<br />  Quite the fashion. By the way, the tailored gray, ventless, three-button suit  Grant wears in the 1959 film was named by GQ as the best suit in film history. The mag gushed that the suit was \\"arguably the most legendary in the history of American cinema.\\"<br />  Suits us.<br />  But one of Eva's lines during the film's dining car seduction scene did not suit censors and was redubbed. She originally said \\"I never make love on an empty stomach,\\", but it was changed in post-production to \\"I never discuss love on an empty stomach\\" because censors felt the original version was too risqu&eacute;.<br />  And even know we know the final chase was not actually filmed at South Dakota's Mt. Rushmore---Hitchcock couldn't get permission to shoot an attempted murder on a national monument---we suspend disbelieve, with a rush for more action. That final scene was actually filmed on a studio replica of Mt. Rushmore; watch it again and note that everything is shot carefully, and the faces of George, Teddy, Thomas and Abe linked with violence. (No wonder one of the film's original working titles was The Man on Lincoln's Nose.)<br />  By the way, another pivotal scene takes place at the United nations, but Hitchcock couldn't get permission to film near the UN, so he filmed footage of the building using a camera hidden in a parked van; the rooms were later recreated on a soundstage.<br />  Bless such sneakiness.<br />  And when you watch North By Northwest again, you can do it to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Hitchcock's sleek masterwork in a spectacularly restored Blu-ray edition---the first of the famed director's films to become available on this state-of-the-art format. Warner Home Video has done us all a welcome pleasure by meticulously restoring and remastering the flick, scanning the original VistaVision production elements in 8K resolution so, they promise, \\"the resulting presentation reveals a depth of field and clarity never before possible, only serving to heighten every thrill-packed moment of this beloved classic.\\"<br />  Bless their greedy little money-making hearts.<br />  The film, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau, is a stylish, action-packed espionage caper written by Ernest Lehman, with music by that genius known as Bernard Herrmann. The film, alas, was only nominated for three Academy Awards (Best Writing, Film Editing and Art Direction) and won none, though it did rank in the No. 4  spot on the American Film Institute's \\"100 Years...100 Thrills,\\" a compilation of the top 100 thrilling movies in American cinema. In 1995, North by Northwest was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\\"<br />  Oh yes. The crop duster sequence. It was set in northern Indiana (the square Indiana highway signs were replicas placed in view by Hitchcock), but was shot on location near the towns of Wasco and Delano, north of Bakersfield, California, just east of the intersection of Corcoran Road and Garces Highway 155.<br />  The plane flying in the scene is a N3N, a World War II Navy pilot trainer that had been converted for crop dusting. The plane that hits the truck and explodes is a wartime Boeing Model 75. Hitchcock bought the worn-out plane for the explosion for a few hundred dollars.<br />  We'll end with a quiz. Why were Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln chose to be chiseled in stone?  Washington is on there because he commanded the Revolutionary War and was the first president; Jefferson fought for westward expansion and authored the Declaration of Independence; Roosevelt promoted conservation; Lincoln restored the Union and ended Slavery. The carving of Mt. Rushmore took place between October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, under the direction of Gutzon Borglum, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the United States of America.he plane that hits the truck and explodes is a wartime Boeing Model 75.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Maybe I'm the only person on the planet who didn't really care for the earlier Whitney Houston, all lungpower and polished-brass vocals, swooping and sweeping and obliterating everything in its path.      The last thing I expected was to become a stark raving Whitney Houston fan, this late in her career, based on about three days' listening to this CD.    She is superb.  The years have taken the shine off her voice and added everything in the way of feeling and authenticity.  This is a girl who has smoked too many Newports (and too much of something else, we are sure) and has partied her tail off, as she put it, for way too many years.    When she sings \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength,\\" it has real grit and meaning.  When she essays a gritty straight version of Leon Russell's \\"A Song for You\\" that morphs into a KILLER Euro-disco dance throwdown, she's downright triumphant.  This is one of those records that is better every time you play it.  I dont care how many takes, how much Autotune, and how much sweetening and patching these producers had to do to produce this record with the Whitney we have now, but DANG, folks, it was worth it.  Great, modern soul, the best.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|Come on now! We are all Whitney fans but she does not sound even half as good as she used to. It hurts to say, but at least I am being honest. Just because I am a fan doesn't mean that I have to lie and candy-coat my comment. The songs are so lame!!! Not to mention \\"A Song for You\\"...Christina Aguilera ate that song up!!!!! After hearing her version, you have to come out very strong singing this great Mr. Hathaway hit. However, I still wish Whitney much success with this cd and her career.
B002M5ZCEU|5.0|She never left me or my friends hearts.    Whitney, don't ever listen to negative comments! They will be out there. You have an amazing talent. My Best Friend sent me your new CD from itunes.com as a gift yesterday because she knew I was broke and wouldn't be able to afford it. She had just purchased it and I was listening to her copy while we talking on the phone. We spent many times talking about our hopes and prayers for your recovery. After I downloaded it.[[ASIN:B001AQTWF2 I Look to You]] I listened and listened to it.  I even got up during the night to listen to it over and over again...I believe in Freedom of speech so go ahead and speak, just don't listen Whitney! Your tribute to your mom and fans on GMA this morning while singing \\"I look to you\\" was remarkable. I cry every time I listen to it so I truly understand your difficulty singing it today on Good Morning America.   You go girl! Keep up the Great Voice.      Vera Bauer
B001TODCII|3.0|A violent movie that relies on the viewer setting aside all expectations that the progression of the story line is possible.  Liam Neeson is always good and had the writers kept the premise but carried it through in a less fantastic manner, it would be a totally solid movie.
B0014QNGA0|5.0|Though Juan Diego Fl&oacute;rez is now well established in the opera houses around the world as the king of bel canto, this new CD reminds of one of his traits too often forgotten: this artist is more about the music than he is with the splendor of career.  In this well recorded CD he is joined by distinguished colleagues who share the bel canto repertoire when duets alternate with arias. These 'collaborations' range form the 'incidental' with Placido Domingo in the Rossini 'Otello' to the completely shared duet with Anna Netrebko in Bellini's 'I puritani' - examples only.<br /><br />But when Fl&oacute;rez stands alone he is even more radiant.  His performance of Donizetti's aria 'Una furtiva lacrima' from 'L'elisir d'amore', probably one of the most recorded and most often sung arias in the repertoire, is true bel canto singing.  His treatment of the line and his sensitive embellishments refuse to go to the sobbing Italiante style, but instead demonstrate just what the bel canto style is all about.  This is a glorious album and one that would serve as a fine introduction to the art of bel canto as well as to the gifts of this young Peruvian tenor extraordinaire.  Grady Harp, September 09
B000A2RRF4|3.0|I have always loved Michael but found that this was not age appropriate for me.  The sound was too loud and you could not turn it down to a level that would have been enjoyable for me.  This is appropriate for kids not adults who like smooth sounds.
0061854549|5.0|This is an interesting look at why people make the decisions that they do.  We've all been there, whether it's eating too much, drinking too much. spending too much, not using protection during sex, or something equally as \\"crazy.\\"  If you've wondered why these things happen, this is a good one to read.  Lots of good experiments make this go very quickly.  I literally read it within a couple of days.    I think this would be helpful for people who sell things for a living.  Could also be helpful for people in relationships.  It's really good for anybody who is trying to make changes in their lives though.  If you're eating too much or not exercising enough, this might just have the key as to why.  Same for drinking, smoking, or whatever other habits you have.
B0011DNJ76|5.0|A great American roots music offering. Her voice accompanied by jaw dropping guitar solos and a fierce thumping bass made me get up and buy it after hearing it while in a local book store. From the cover you would be forgiven to think that this was just another Rockabilly album, but that is not the case. Whats included here is a mixture of Rock, Blues,R'n'B, Jazz, R'n'R, Rockabilly etc with many tracks being more a fusion of these styles then of just one particular musical genre. It is this that makes it fresh and original and not just another retro 50's album.
B001F290E4|4.0|Seal is a great singer.  You can tell from listening to these songs that he really loves them.  I love them too, which is why I purchased this album.    Can't really put my finger on it, but something is lacking here.  It isn't his performance.  I think that it's just too polished, too slick, or too thought out.      The original versions of these songs were raw.  They had a certain energy about them that made them special.    This isn't quite a \\"Kenny G\\" moment, where all the soul has been sucked out, but it's not what I would expect from a top-shelf artist like Seal.  It could have been much better.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. My granddaughter wanted to see it and I could not find it in the stores so I ordered it.  We have all enjoyed, several times, watching this classic.

B0024F08UG|5.0|When i bought my blu-ray player and high def t.v. there were a number of titles   in my dvd collection that were prime candidates for getting the blu-ray treatment.  THE TOWERING INFERNO was at the top of the list and i'm happy to report they did    a stellar job.     For instance little bits of dialogue never understood before are now clearly   audible. In addition the intricate design/pattern of many of the costumes are   now eye poppingly clear.    If i had to choose one scene that shows off the blue ray transfer best its the  scene where Paul Newman, Jennifer Jones and the two kids take turns climbing  down the busted staircase railing. a total audio/visual experience. For instance  water from a pipe busted in the explosion is raining down on them and the nearby  exposed brick wall. The sound of the water is sooooooooooo realistically clear  and sharp you'll check to see if its raining in your living room.     If you like classic action flicks on blu-ray this an absolute must for your  collection.

B0025VLELQ|4.0|I'll skip the actual movie review because most people ordering probably already know what it is about. I just want to touch on a few highlights on the blu-ray version.    First off, my wife and I did a comparison between an upconverted DVD played on a Harman Kardon DVD-38 and the blu-ray played on our PS3. The DVD picture quality was adiquate although grainy. The blu-ray transfer was much clearer and in comparison to the upconverted DVD showed much more detail than you would think would be there. While it isn't a \\"reference quality\\" transfer, it was still an improvement.    The audio was nicely done in transfer, but some of the background music was not there. Most noteably when Louis walked in on Beta breathing under the covers going through his transformation. On the DVD, there are horns building in anticipation over the sound effects, but on the blu-ray, it was just the sound effects.    All in all, I'm very happy with this release and have already retired the DVD from my collection.
B00009RDGA|5.0|Bognonavich was a bit of a darling and at the height of his popularity and power when this modest script presented. Dipped but not saturated in the look of older films, the director evokes the Depression years, Grapes of wrath mid 30s as a homage to Steinbeck, Ford and sundry giants of that era. This is a s perfect a film as Bogdonavich made, though it didn't claim the critical kudos of, 'What's Up Doc?', and the brilliant,'Last Picture Show'. Most of the cast from these two gems, moved with him on this project; a kind of ensemble acting crew that facilitated very warm acting results. But the massive star amongst the lot was the novice, Tatum O'Neil. It is a role for which she received just rewards and will take your heart any which way. She's a tough, shrewd, brilliant survivor (at least at this stage of her celluloid life). I've rarely been transfixed by a child performance of this magnitude. The look of the film is enthralling; wide-angled lens giving sharpness of detail and wonderful depth of field. The black and white print immediately yields an archival feel, and the texture of those wonderful photos of dustbowl hard times.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Simply awsome. Excelent dvd, excelent sound.   A pretty good job of Michael Bublé.
B000002JB8|1.0|The CD itself is a great collection of Vangelis music. I am very fond of Vangelis. His music touches me. The only problem -- the CD that I received through an online order was defective. There is no clear policy regarding defective CDs. The return policy seems to be appropriate for unopened and unused CDs.
B001UDYI9K|2.0|I have been listening to the Alan Parsons Project all my life. The very first CD I purchased in my life was Stereotomy. I still love it and listen to it quite frequently. I am 58 years old... I grew up with this music and I love it. I own every Alan Parsons Project album, except for Poe: More Tales of Mystery and Imagination, which I am planning to buy, specially for the inclusion of Steve Balsamo, marvelous singer discovered by Eric Woolfson himself a few years ago (God! Listen to this guy singing \\"Immortal\\", written by Woolfson and included in this album, it is impressive!). One of the biggest thrills I've had was assisting to an Alan Parsons Project concert with my daughter and son about four years ago. This guys blew the place away! Unforgettable!  But... regarding this album by Eric Woolfson, I am so sorry that my opinion is way different. I am honestly disappointed. I have to say that I find it boring and lame. Believe me, I never thought I would be saying something like this about any Alan Parsons related music. I have to grant to Woolfson making the whole thing sound a lot like the Alan Parsons Project we all reminisce. His voice remains bringing back that feeling only felt when listening to \\"Nothing Left To Loose\\" or \\"Time\\". But I feel he lacks the force and energy of his old recordings, and the same goes to the band. To me it sounds like a tired Alan Parsons Project, without having had breakfast. If you follow my meaning (listen to \\"Along The Road Together\\" to illustrate this point). One more thing is that these are supposed to be songs that APP never recorded, but I feel like they are leftovers that were'nt good enough. Something like \\"The Songs That Lennon & McCartney Gave Away\\". I also own that one, and even though it reminds the Beatles music... it is'nt just as good.   In many of the songs the lyrics are totally lame. Listen to \\"Any Other Day\\" or \\"I Can See Round Corners\\" or \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\". So lame! They could have been written and sung by Taylor Swift or The Jonas Brothers! \\"... watching the green grass grow, watching the river flow, watching the clouds go by...\\" Give me a break!   I do like the song \\"Immortal\\" a lot. That one is outstanding. And even though Eric Woolfson's voice is always a pleasure and an experience to listen to, his interpretation is nowhere near to Steve Balsamo's. I think Woolfson himself would agree with this.   I think this song rescued the second star I gave to this album.

B00275EGTC|5.0|After working alone on the moon for close to three years Sam Bell(Sam Rockwell) starts to see things. I'm reminded somewhat of \\"2001\\" and \\"Solaris\\". Both of these films portrayed a psychological point of view. Here, as in \\"2001\\", we have a computer(Gerty, voice of Kevin Spacey) who keeps our protagonist company and helps run things at the moon station. We're initially unsure about Gerty's intentions just as we were with Hal in \\"2001\\". And when Sam is rescued by another who looks identical to himself he realizes that things aren't as he thought that they were all of these years. As in \\"2001\\" when David Bowman sees himself in the future gradually aging we see the new Sam watch as his older self gradually dies. And as in the movie \\"Solaris\\", where people were made to confront their pasts through the exploration of memories, here too Sam is faced with reevaluating his past memories and examining what is true or not.<br /><br />Moon is a story about identity, reality, perception, and mortality. We see Sam as a kind of ironic, comic character, a puppet of sorts, someone who finds himself in an amusing, though also frightening, situation. What does one do when one discovers that there are two of you? Which is the real you? Has one's life been an illusion all along? As the film progresses Sam starts to adjust to his dilemma and begins to find ways to live with his \\"other\\".<br /><br />This film, directed by Duncan Jones, is about the inner drama about what it means to be human, and to confront who we are and what it means to exist in a seemingly absurd world.

B002T9H2LK|1.0|I tried hard to like this, but in the end, this movie was just as bad and boring as Tarantino's crap-fest, Death Proof! There were a few funny parts and a couple of action scenes, but the rest was just dull conversations in another language. You practically read the whole movie. There was 95% talking, and 5% action! The film is told in 5 chapters, and the only two chapters I kinda liked were Chapter Two & Five. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine who is the leader of a group called The Basterds. They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest. A few weeks ago, I rented the original Inglorious Bastards movie to get ready for this one, but that was a waste of time, because this has nothing to do with the 1970's version. I definitely would not recommend INGLORIOUS BASTERDS!!!
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Since so many reviews here have provided a plot summary, I'm just going to write comments...<br /><br />There were many, many points in this movie that made me cringe, expecting to be run over by sentimentalism and stereotypes.  For example when Kowalski takes Thao with him to teach him \\"how to be a man\\"---I thought they'd wind up in a bar with a bunch of K's buddies competing to see who had the biggest wanger, but no something else entirely (not all that believable, but at least it was rather original) happens.<br /><br />So this movie is a lot like that.  It directly addresses and traffics in some all-too-common racial stereotypes and bigotry, yet somehow manages to transcend them in a way that is not hopelessly corny or preachy.  The ending is rather surprising, kind of Buddhist in fact---true self-sacrifice, a little idealistic perhaps, but at least not the usual macho-superhero-vigilante fantasy.  Considering Eastwood's filmography and iconic image, \\"Gran Torino\\" is actually very subversive, in its quiet and understated way.  There is a subtle element of satire and parody here, which most viewers will probably miss: Eastwood is actually poking fun at cranky aggrieved old white guys and their cartoonish ideas about masculinity.  At the same time he presents an alternative scenario in which that bitter old geezer finally becomes a TRUE man, i.e. a FULL HUMAN BEING, by growing beyond his own petty prejudices and, at the surprise ending, transcending his own ego and truly sacrificing himself wholeheartedly and voluntarily---in contrast to being a frightened overgrown boy forced to play soldier by the Army.<br /><br />My only reservations, and the reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, is that Eastwood could have been a better director in terms of eliciting better performances from his two Hmong leads, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who reminded me of kids acting in a school play.  Bee Vang is especially amateurish, especially in the last part when Kowalski locks him in the basement to prevent him from following.  Surely Eastwood could've hired acting coaches to better prepare and train these two?<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the Special Features on the DVD...basically it's a vintage car fan's wet dream, and there's lots of sophomoric babbling about cars and \\"masculinity\\"---but what about for the rest of us?  A little mini-documentary snippet on the history of the Hmong and their dealings with the US military in Indochina would have been much more interesting and apropos. Well, unless all the macho car gushing is part of Eastwood's hidden joke.prevent him from following.  Surely Eastwood could've hired acting coaches to better prepare and train these two?

B000WCN8SC|4.0|The Doors' first 6 albums comprise this package, which features all the attributes--and flaws--of arguably one of the most important rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Though productive for only about three years, the Doors' sound survives the test of time. Ray Manzarek's organ, Robbie Kreiger's versatile guitar and John Densmore's articulate percussion sound as fresh today as they did 40 years ago. But the real reason to buy this package is because it is haunted--chillingly so. The ghost of Jim Morroson is alive and well, packing more power than any other rock and roll front man since his death at 27 back in 1971. Although Manzarek and Krieger penned many of the lyrics, one can't help but conclude Morrison's poetic aptitude pumped up the repertoire larger than life. If you're over 50, do yourself a favor and add this to your collection. It'll make you proud to be a part of the generation that challenged the American status-quo before buying back into the same so eagerly. You can smell the ten dollar lids, see the black light and flourescent posters. The Summer of Love has not yet faded into history.
0765317389|5.0|I'll admit, I'm new to the whole Science Fiction genre (whether that be books, movies, etc.), but this book absolutely blew me away. A friend recommended it to me, saying that the story changed his life haha. I laughed when I first heard that, but then decided to pick it up. I was actually in the middle of reading through \\"Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\" and had the bright idea to start reading \\"Ender's Game\\". Well, needless to say, Percy was returned to the library and I'll probably never get to finish it.    You can read all the other reviews to get a plot summary, so I'll just tell you how much I enjoyed it. I love stories that start of small, but by the end they cosmically epic. This is one of the best examples of that. The twists and turns are so interesting and the character of Ender is someone you can relate to. Pulled and manipulated by various people, Ender is confused between being a human being with emotions and feelings, and being simply a weapon of war. Sure, that's been a common theme in stories before, but this is much deeper. Especially because Ender is merely a child.     I loved all the action, the moments in the story when you find yourself shocked yelling \\"WHAT!?!\\", the relationships between characters, the movement of plot, and especially all the mystery. Excellent book.

I am not a monumental fan of Whitney Houston but she's had some great hits in her early and middle career and I DID like the music from The Bodyguard very much!  To me that was the pinnacle of her success!  What I like about the new CD is surprising in itself, the uptempo R&B songs.  Normally I like her ballads with perhaps the exception of \\"I'm Every Woman\\".  The ballads are okay, but nothing exceptional.  It could grow on me though, the title track is simple but very pleasant to listen to.  Song For You starts off a little fast (being sung too fast) but finishes very nicely with a catchy dance grove!  Some of the songs I found a little boring but for the most part it held my attention all the way through.  Perhaps some may not like this comparison but I liked this CD WAY better than Mariah Carey's last CD for example E=MC2 (and I am a Mariah Carey fan).  Could it have been better?  Yes, seems like the biggest task for veteran artists are finding the great songs.  No better example than the last Celine outing.  But Whitney Houston did pretty good with it here, perhaps she will do better next time.  Her voice has lost a little range perhaps a sign of age and some of the abuse she put herself through.  But she can still sing!  I hope the CD does sell well, the first week I believe it will sell half a million and from there on it shall be interesting!
0312330537|3.0|I want to sort out my personal feelings about the book. I am a lover and initially Shantaram made me want to love Gregory Roberts. What I loved about him is his ability to tell a story about a city and people that he loved. I enjoyed how he was able to find the soul of the Indian people and tell about it in a way that I could feel the people, feel the energy of Bombay, be shocked at the rage of a crowd of Indians after an auto accident, go into the smells of the slums, and the beauty of the slums. He helped me loved India. His writing style for me was authentic. He isn't your usual writer and the roughness and lengthiness of his descriptions just reflected his roughness as a person. So his descriptive story telling is masterful and I am richer and wiser from knowing his book.         What wore on me were his relationships. By the end I wanted to shout....what were you thinking....there were just too many dark souless people ...Karla for example. Here was a woman totally afraid to reveal even the basics of herself. Why was the author so attracted to a person who was manipulative secretive and very unskilled at loving. I could understand being bitter about prison experiences and somewhat hardened, but joining the Indian mafia. Where are the warning bells that sing out danger danger danger. This may not be such a great idea. So he is a flawed hero.         And the mafia head that loved him....well he loved him so much that he was willing to risk his dying in the darkness of an Indian prison in order to get money for a greater cause. On the one hand, if Roberts is knowledgeable about the Mafia, he really helps you to understand the strange loyalty and love of these emotionally wounded people. On the other hand, as the story continues on and on and on and these relationships became the focus of the book, I found myself getting depressed about life and love. And then eventually I lost my admiration for the writer. The book had started to get too fantastic and the authorsflaws as a human being....began to get more pronounced. I felt like I was in a bad relationship and had been tricked into loving someone that wasn't really so loveable.          The character Prubaker was to me the soul of the book. Laughing loving spirited kind wise. I am grateful for the book that gave me characters like him and descriptions of an India I didn't know. There was a pearl of wisdom in the philosophy section that helped me to wonder if life is moving furthur into complexity. I don't know but it is a challenging and liberating thought.I feel more street saavy and know the darknesses of life with the poor as well as the lightness. In the end it is like life itself, full of suprises and disappointments. I am grateful.        M
B0007M22TI|3.0|Average video quality. Great Audio quality. Camera shots are poor at best. Set design is impressive. The songs are performed excellently. These women can sing! The entire DVD is pretty good from start to finish. The video could have been better if the video producer would not have been a rock star wanna-be! Too many cross fades, too many bright lights in the eyes transitions. The video producer of this video clearly got this all wrong.     If you like Celtic music, this is a god DVD. But, the Slane castle DVD is by far, much better as far as the video quality and video content is concerned. If you can only afford one video, buy \\"A New Journey\\" Slane Castle video.  You will not be disappointed.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from the 1964 to 1971 period, moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era\\" of the Stone Age. While this CD has a rather definitive selection of some of \\"greatest hits\\" from this period so there are no bad tracks here the stick outs are the super-rock classic \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\"(as always), the very epitome of the 1960s quasi-revolutionary style \\"Street Fighting Man\\", the bluesy \\"No Expectations\\" and a song that has risen in my estimation over the years, \\"Factory Girl\\". Need I say more-no beggars need apply here.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Season 3 regains its refreshing originality - if I can use such an analogy. Dexter is up to his old tricks - stalking  and slowly draining the lifeblood out of killers. I won't give it way, but it's full of surprising twists and turns. The Jimmy Smits character was especially diabolical. In fact, it's so engrossing, if my wife doesn't stop replacing the disk with her much adored SITC-CD, she may get fitted for a plastic bag! Happy hunting all because Dexter is back!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have the little Maclaren stroller and there is no good place to put drinks, keys, cell phone, etc. This product has been AWESOME and is light enough that the stroller doesn't tip over backwards when you take out your child. EXCELLENT product!!
0312539517|5.0|I believe I have read all of Archer's books and this does not disappoint. I am always drawn by his historical fiction flare.
1416914307|3.0|All right, here it is. Straight as the arrow I'll never actually shoot. The first book was a 'didn't put it down' the second book was a 'could put it down, but didn't' the third book was a 'wanted to put it down every five minutes and skipped half the book to get to the ending'. The romance was great all the way through the series. The action kept pace and was every bit as great as the romance however this book was a lot of filler. Simon, while a great guy/character, did NOT need to be featured as much as he was in this book. If you want to write his story, fine, write HIS story don't incorperate it into a book that was designed to answer some kick a** questions. Are they or aren't they? Will they or won't they? Is there a new love for either, how will they react? By the time I got to this book I was so eager to KNOW that the rest didn't feel important.
1593080050|4.0|I think everyone should read this book just to get acquainted with the real Frankenstein. The creature is interesting, intelligent, emotional, angry and confused. This is nothing like what we see in popular culture. The story is fascinating, especially in the parts where Frankenstein himself is the narrator. We get to see humans from another perspective. The story is well written and leaves the reader with a lot of questions about murder, humanity and friendship.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|(I read on-line that this film is being prepped for 2010 general release. Very strange, given that it has been on DVD for almost a year, as well as available for rental... Now, the exec who decided against the original general release, please stand up... so that we can slap you silly!)<br /><br />A very human looking space traveler Kainan (Jim Caviezel) crash lands his ship on a planet called Earth. The local time is 709 A.D. and the land belongs to Viking Tribes at war with one another. Certain that the Vikings would not comprehend the true nature of his origins, the Outlander hides the remains of his space ship, but not before he realizes he has brought with him a dangerous stow away, a hungry predator that is now picking the locals one by one. As he attempts to track the creature, Kainan is captured by a band of locals and brought to their King. What is Kainan's connection to the creature? Can the Outlander and the weary-of-a-stranger Tribe overcome their mutual mistrust and unite in order to survive? Can Kainan ever find his way home? Will he want to?<br /><br />Outlander is likely the best sci-fi movie you never heard of... WHY would a studio spend $47 million to make a very good product... only to refuse to promote it?! I hunted down a used copy at my local Blockbusters and was shocked by how entertaining and well told the unusual story was, especially when compared to the rest of the so very ho-hum sci-fi fare of 2009... Damsel in distress, wise king, Vikings, alien space ships, and an alien monster who refuses to go vegetarian... Outlander manages to make sense of it all! Well, almost. There are some minor plot holes (how come Vikings can melt alien super metal in their wood burning ovens?), but it's nothing a little suspension of disbelief cannot deal with. Add good casting (I am not a fan of Jim Caviezel, but I thought his performance as a soldier haunted by guilt and a tragic past was convincing and charismatic) and well executed CGI, and the film becomes a must for any sci-fi/action/adult-fairy-tale fan.sci-fi/action/adult-fairy-tale fan.
0739368435|4.0|Juliet Ashton had made a name for herself in the publishing world with a lighthearted account of life in England during WWII. But now that the war is over (1946) she wants to work on something else, something less silly and more meaningful. By chance she gets a letter from Dawsey Adams, a pig farmer on the island of Guernsey which was occupied by the Germans, who had purchased a used book with her name in it. She learns of the unlikely formation of a literary club during the occupation with the unusual name of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Intrigued, she enters into a correspondence with Dawsey and others of the society and learns of the joys and challenges they faced during the war and now as they try to rebuild their lives.<br /><br />Composed entirely of the correspondence between Juliet, her friends, and the people of Guernsey, I was initially a little put off by this book. I found the letter format slow-starting and a bit confusing, and since I listened to the audio book it didn't help that so many voices were used for the different characters. But I soon got past that and found it an interesting way to offer insights into the various people and you come to care about them (especially the sometimes quirky islanders). I had expected it to be a lighthearted book - and it often is - but it also unflinchingly portrays the sufferings and loss caused by war. There's also a subplot of Juliet's romantic life, and while much of the story was rather predictable it didn't detract or lessen the impact of some events. The undercurrent of books and those who appreciate them that runs through the story is interesting, but most of all I appreciated the historical aspect of the story and it's easy to see why the book has been so popular.
0307408833|2.0|I've been a vegan baker for 6 years now, and it's something I pride myself on as person after person compliments me with \\"I'd never guess this was vegan\\" when biting into my treats.  That being said, this book is a huge disappointment. Many of these recipes were clearly not tested, as so many are having them fail (most notably the cupcakes, frosting, banana bread, and cookies.) The ingredients are very expensive, so these failures are costly and frustrating. When things turn out well, they are good, but hardly worth the overall cost.  If you're into vegan baking, get Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World or The Joy of Vegan Baking, both of which contain gluten-free recipes that are far superior to these.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|I purchased for my husband who was seriously into weightlifting some years ago.  I'm not sure if he's looked at it, I think he said he remembered seeing it when it first came out in the VHS tape format.  I plan on looking at it sometime in the future and I decided to purchase it because from time to time, I heard references about it in various media arenas and more recently I was looking at my husband's muscle mag and there was an article about both guys where reference again was made about them in Pumping Iron so I was curious and the price was right!  My favorite muscle guys were Lou (The Hulk) & Arnold (Conan and later the Terminator).
0307454541|5.0|This novel has some of the most remarkable and original characters in mystery fiction, especially Lisbeth Salander, who drives much of the interest for the reader.  The opening is so intriguing that I found I could not put the book down, though some of the material early on seemed to drag somewhat, but was necessary to set up the bizarre situations.  It doesn't take too long, though, in getting going and kept me reading.  The author plays with mystery fiction conventions, using the classic \\"locked room\\" subgenre with a unique twist, and making references to classic authors such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers and Elizabeth George.  The protagonist and his partner are a sort of Holmes and Watson, yet not anything like Holmes and Watson in many respects.  By the end, I was well satisfied and left dying to read the next book, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\"  My only regret is that I fear I may go into withdrawl after I read the third book and am left with no more to read, as the author passed away before he could write a fourth book.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|While the Clive Davis's and other music industry folks would love you to believe that Whitney's long anticipated 'comeback' cd is aural nirvana by a queen reclaiming her crown, in fact it is a mediocre effort at best.  And more importantly, and sadly, it is a stark testament to the ravaging effects of years of substance abuse and neglect on her once amazing vocal skills.<br /><br />I wasn't listening for the 'Whitney of old' with her soaring vocals, perfect timbre and stunning control, as some will accuse anyone who dares to question Ms. Houston's efforts.  After all, there are many ways to judge a musician's ability to connect with an audience--- for instance Marianne Faithfull's ragged yet soulfully penetrating vocal style.  Instead I was listening for stylistic maturity, insightful song selection and the willingness to surrender herself completely and vulnerably to the lyrics.<br /><br />Without these qualities, which are lacking throughout this cd, one is left only able to focus on the degree to which Whitney's vocal talents have diminished--- and they have considerably.<br /><br />I would welcome a 're-tooled' Whitney Houston.  One who isn't looking to compete with the Mariah's, Beyonce's, or even Mary J's, but who finds herself in the songs she sings, and chooses to honestly relate the joy and pain of her life, instead of making mediocre r&b music that only highlights what she's lost and masks the suffering we know she's lived.
0764574124|5.0|I had to learn VBA in a short amount of time because of a project at work, and this book did the job!  Unlike a lot of other programming books, this book is highly accessible and builds up at the right pace, so that nowhere in the book you wonder how the leap was made. Since I was on a time constraint, I was able to read around 75% of the book (without getting bored) and play around with some of the sample coding in 4 days before I returned to work and I was able to hit the ground running. Of course, it takes some practice even after reading it to be a \\"fluent\\" coder, but the point is the book teaches you how to think about VBA by explaining the concept of 'object hierarchy' so that when you don't know how to do something, you know exactly where to look for it and how to figure it out. I constantly went back to it until I was confident enough to tackle complicated macros on my own and I couldn't believe the transformation - in two weeks I went from \\"never seen VBA in my life before\\" to a solid coder! Highly recommended if you want to write powerful macros in no time.
078322947X|5.0|This movie, a remake of The Wages of Fear, is perhaps the greatest cinematographic accomplishments of the 70s. Unappreciated in the summer of its release by a movie going audience more interested in Star Wars or Jaws, it did poorly at the box office. Yet it is a relentless, suspenseful movie whose story and characters will stay on your mind for years to come. The musical score by the incomparable Tangerine Dream is mesmerizing.

B0013D8LCW|4.0|Shelter doesn't rise to the level of great filmmaking but it's a really nicely made movie that's heart-warming and ultimately enjoyable to watch. To be sure, the script has too many \\"dudes\\" and \\"bros\\" and lots of guys catching waves. But it's no more a surfer movie that Brokeback Mountain was a cowboy movie. Surely that's part of the storytelling vehicle, but it's the human interactions that matter.<br /><br />The other downside is that director Jonah Markowitz could have made a sexier film without crossing the line into soft porn. Shelter is tamer sexually than it needs to be. Honestly, would two guys who'd made love all night wake up together the next morning wearing underwear?<br /><br />I occasionally found the music soundtrack somewhat distracting, even though some of the songs were good.<br /><br />Still, Shelter is well-made film with a fairly good script, fine performances and excellent cinematography and film editing. The surfing and ocean scenes were beautifully filmed and edited.<br /><br />So what if it has a somewhat predictably happy ending? Not every story of gay men ends with tragedy or heartbreak. This film deals with subject matter about which I'm personally familiar - dealing with your own sexuality and trying to decide your own future while playing father figure to your sister's offspring.<br /><br />Zach, played by Trevor Wright, is caring and sensitive while being tough at the same time. His art and his surfing are his escapes from the realities of every day life.<br /><br />Shaun, played by Brad Rowe, has returned home to lick his wounds after the breakup of his relationship but finds himself falling for Zach, the best friend of his younger brother Gabe. Shaun taught Gabe and Zach to surf and its surfing that brings Shaun and Zach together.<br /><br />The movie shows how conflicted Zach is about his sexuality. There's the moment when after a night of drinking together he allows Shaun to kiss him, only to wake the next morning running away from what happened. He returns the stares of another surfer in a beach parking lot, but turns away when he becomes uncomfortable. He becomes standoffish with Shaun each time he gets questions about his sexuality from his sister Jeanne, with whom he lives and whose he is father figure.<br /><br />He initially gives in, but backs away when he's unsure of how to deal with all the pressures in his life while loving another man.<br /><br />Shaun is patient, but I don't believe overly so. There are moments when Shaun pushes for what he wants but backs away when he realizes he's pushing too hard.<br /><br />Overall, I see places where some improvements could have made this good movie into an excellent one. Still, it is a good, very enjoyable movie and one worth adding to your DVD collection.er in a beach parking lot, but turns away when he becomes uncomfortable.

0307460444|5.0|I have spent several hours just leafing through this book, admiring the gorgeous photos and daydreaming about making all of these inventive little treats.  The book is well-organized and thorough, with a cupcake for every occasion and palette.  I made the carrot cupcakes with cream cheese frosting, following the recipe to the letter.  I was very happy with the results--so much so that I gave most of them away so that I wouldn't eat them all myself.  They were moist and rich, and gave the bakery down the block (the one that specializes in cupcakes) a run for their money.  With this book, I would feel confident enough to make cupcakes for a formal event (such as a shower) rather than buying them as I have in the past.  And she really does have just about every cupcake for every occasion one could imagine.  She even has a section on presentation and gifting the cupcakes, which I really appreciated--I often give baked goods as gifts.  Using this book is a joy--the cupcakes are beautiful and tasty; an edible art project if you will.  I also own \\"Hello Cupcake\\" and \\"Crazy for Cupcakes.\\"  One is great for decorating ideas, and the other is great for recipes.  I like Martha Stewart's book the best because she is solid in both of these areas--you won't have pretty cupcakes that taste terrible or delicious treats that look like a mess.  She does an excellent job with both aspects.  I'm going to buy it for my girlfriends who enjoy baking.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|As mentioned by others, this BD transfer relies on digital noise reduction methods and edge enhancement to clean up the image. What this means to the average viewer is an artificially enhanced picture sub-par to the standard and potential of 1080p. You may get away with it on a 720p set.   Otherwise great movie.

B00008G9JN|5.0|If you're looking for another great Jethro Tull album from the 1970's and you already have Aqualung, this is an excellent choice. Ian Anderson and Martin Barre really hit their stride here, producing an album that doesn't get heard very much but is one of the band's finest. They do an outstanding job of evoking a musically-based emotional experience of what life in the woods might be like, while still retaining that Jethro Tull sound. And they do it with a strong mix of acoustic, folk-based music, and harder driving electric guitar rock. The bonus tracks are a nice plus, and the sound quality is excellent.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Nolan creates a new superheroe movie genre with \\"Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Night\\", it would be great to see how other Batman comic villians are developed in sequels with this same \\"more real characters\\" concept, just hope Nolan keeps on charge of directing these. It would also have been fantastic that this same concept had been applied to the desastrous \\"Superman Returns\\" film, altough this would be much more difficult becouse Batman has no superpowers and that's why he can be more real. Superman haves superpowers, which opposes to this concept, so after \\"The Dark Night\\" it's going to be an almost impossible mission for directors to create this same atmosfer with a Superman film. Sad, Superman is my favorite superhero, but \\"The Dark Night\\" is definetly my favorite superhero movie.

B001G8NW6Y|5.0|I read this book as a college grad fairly ignorant of economic matters. It completely changed my world view. Perhaps that sounds hyperbolic, but the common-sense lessons about human thought and action in this small, easily digestible book have materialized in virtually every aspect of my life, from the obvious, such as my views on political policy, to the obscure, such as my relationships and my satisfaction with my own choices. Hazlitt is never heavy-handed; he comes over as extremely objective because he doesn't need to convince anyone of his views. He is confident that anyone who takes the time to read, consider, and understand true economics would be hard-pressed to reject the logical conclusions he offers.     The book essentially springs from the premise that economic fallacy results from considering the effects of a policy or action only on a specific group or over a short period of time. From this he goes on to explain how such fallacies have invaded every single sphere of public policy. While before I vaguely opposed the idea of public works projects, tariffs, and welfare, I had no reasoning to back up my thoughts so I rarely expressed them. Hazlitt's book, instead of arming me with political doublespeak, provided me with the solid theory to truly understand why things that seem hard to argue against--kickbacks for hardworking but suffering farmers, for example-- are really counter productive. I recommend this book for people who hail from any economic class or political party; it won't offend you, and will do nothing but make you more informed and better equipped to understand the world around you.

B00006L83N|4.0|Odyssey is the follow-up project to Symphony X's masterful V: The New Mythology Suite. As expected from a band with as many talents as these guys have, they continue to grow and change with this new album. As with all growth, not everything goes the way everyone may want. This album holds true to that notion. In many ways, this album plays much like someone riding the waves on the cover art...it is very up and down....    With the musical prowess each member brings to the table, it is then not surprising that their playing continues to impress. I do not think that is ever in question with Symphony X. Once again, there is never a point where the music seems to lack a given sound or technique and, at times, the listener is wowed as much as they might be listening to Dream Theater pyrotechnics.    With every wave comes a trough....    One of the amazing parts of V: was the vocals and at times during Odyssey, they are melodic, lyrical, and fully impressive and enjoyable. What tends to be a bit maddening at times is Russel Allen's apparent desire to sound more and more like Ronnie James Dio. With a voice as amazing as his voice seems to be, the question has to be asked, \\"Why rough it up and screem?\\" Fortunately, that approach is still well mixed in with the smoother vocals that are fully developed in V:.    The opening track, Inferno, is a case in point. The music comes on hard and fast and, in general is very enjoyable. However, I continue to find myself distracted by the singing. The second track, Wicked, comes across in a similar vein.    The third track, Incantations, has some of the same. However, the vocals are tempered somewhat and the lyrics, seemingly based on the Disney story \\"Soccerer's Apprentice\\" are quite entertaining.    Accolade II, is a definitely highlight for this album. This is a fanatastic song describing a knight from the Crusaides, performed amazingly by the band.    King of Terrors is one of those songs where the RJD-esque vocals actually add to the song. This song would seem to be based off Edgar Allen Poe's \\"Pit & Pendulum\\" and does a very good job of musically detailing the terror the victum is going through as death slowly approaches.    The Turning is unremarkable. Not a bad song, but not a standout song either.    Awakening is a much more enjoyable song and also a highlight.    Then we reach the title track, Odyssey. This is a 23 minute epic giving a brief summary of Homer's classic of the same name. This is where all the musicianship, song writing, and performing abilities the band has comes to the front. This type of epic seems to be Symphony X's forte. From beginning to end, this song takes the listener along for a fantastic voyage. This piece alone pulls the album up to a four star rating!    For the limited edition, the bonus track, Masquerade, is somewhat more lyrical and enjoyable than the Turning, but in the same, take-it-or-leave-it vein.    The album concept is great. The songs seem to be well written. However, delivery is still somewhat inconsistent. The move toward a more roughened sound, for me, just seems to be moving away from what makes these guys great. This album gets a four star rating from me based soley on Accolade II and the title track. Those two pieces are that good. The remainder is frustrating in its inconsistancy. Yet, no song on here is bad by normal standards. However, the bar was set very high by V:. This album doesn't quite reach that bar on the whole.

However, the Batman Unmasked featurette is an unexpected pleasure, as it psychoanalyzes Batman in all his incarnations.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I got this DVD back in the spring and made the mistake of using heavier weights than Jillian. I was already in good shape but wanted to be \\"shredded\\". Bad move! The heavier weights are unnecessary with all of the plyometrics. My body began to break down, literally, from overwork (swelling and loss of tone). After a break of 2 months, I tried it again. I've been doing level 2 and I love it. I honestly think it's one of the best most effective 25-27 minute workouts I've ever owned. And I have a fairly vast library of workout DVDs, nearly 50 in total. I feel wonderful while doing level 2 and I've seen great results in my arms, shoulders and back with only 3 lb weights. It's amazing. I've been able to see definition in my abs that I haven't seen before, even at the most fit points in my life. And this is post pregnancy, that's unexpected! :-)    Level 3 on the other hand, has lots of jumping and pushups but the arms/back portion with weights is weaker. Be careful here, I hurt myself with the jumping lunges - a strained soaz muscle. The jumps are extremely high impact. Much of level 3 does not seem as difficult or challenging (to me) as level 2 apart from the jumping. I found this portion of the DVD perplexing, the mixture of exercises just doesn't make sense. So now I do level 2 and then add a few things from level 3 - the superman moves are excellent. Even if you never progress to level 3 you'll have a kick butt workout and you *will* see a difference if you stick with it. I found that I have had better results when I do the workout(s) 4-5 days a week and allow my body to repair rather than daily as Jillian recommends.
B0013GAVEA|4.0|I saw a clip of the credits for this film which has a gonzo pizza delivery scooter racing through town. Wow! The rest of the movie is funny and entertaining, but I keep re-watching the intro!
0312370849|3.0|I have been reading about the Holocaust for many years now and because of this have developed a much greater understanding of the time period and lives that were so altered by it. I had never heard of the incident protrayed in this book and have now, because of this book, studied much more about it. But sadly, this book did not convey the horror, the strength. I was left wanting more of the history and less of the story. Maybe just a good jumping off place.
1401200605|4.0|While Batman tries to discover the mastermind behind a kidnapping, the mysterious new villain attempts to kill Batman by sabotaging his equipment.  Although the villain's identity isn't that big a mystery, this is still a good start to a new story arc.  Includes a vist to Metropolis to confer with Superman.
B000W00Y0Y|4.0|Some very good songs and the Blue Ray dvd is more than decent. I enjoyed it but not as good as Elton or Roy Orbison
B00012FXAE|5.0|This review is for the 2-disc collector's edition (I mention this because Amazon seems to be lumping all the reviews of various editions together...)<br /><br />The plot of this film is covered in other reviews, so I shall skip that, except to say that even if you somehow don't know anything about the first film, the movie does a decent job of filling in the backstory, so it is possible for first-time viewers to pick up the story with little discomfort or confusion.<br /><br />This is a respectable, well-done sequel. Where-as the first film is a tense horror film, this one attempts to up the ante by adding more aliens and more fodder for them to snack on; essentially this is an action film, though it does have some scary moments. It wears its influences from the original film on its sleeve, though, with everything from the moody film-noirish lighting to the automated countdown before a devastating explosion at the end.<br /><br />This edition of the film offers the theatrical release as well as a director's cut, which is essentially 20 minutes of deleted scenes. Personally, I think they were deleted with wisdom by the execs, as they actually add very little but do take away from the pacing. Others may disagree, of course.<br /><br />Disc two is an exhaustive documentary on the 'making of' that covers pretty much any and every aspect of the film that fans could possibly want to know.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Many times it was mentioned that this is the first album in 7 years. this is the first good album where she is back in 11 years. The last time she did good music was back in 1998.  If you are looking for great vocals, look no further. This is it, the best female voice heard on this earth for as long as there are recordings.    she is so fun and emotional and delivers like no one else. period.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Great performance and shows a great moment on Bill Murray's work. You can't go wrong
B001NFNFNU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, despite it's gruesome scenes.  Jeffrey Donovan shows his true acting gifts/talents (quite a change from Burn Notice, but I like it) in this film, which was the seller for me.  Ms. Jolie was very good in her roll; hard to believe this is a true story.  Thankfully we've come a long way in child kidnapping issues.
630460288X|4.0|No more to say, if you've seen it, you know it's a classic on Sylvester Stallone's work
0385737424|5.0|I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I picked up the book. Certainly - as I had heard the buzz - a good read. What I wasn't expecting was the need to leave work immediately in order to finish the book in peace. It was engaging and enchanting. go pick it up.
B000008H4E|5.0|I originally listened to this album on vinyl, in the 1970's and was smitten with the combination of Vangelis music with Jon Anderson's eery light timber voice. Its lost none of its charms, all these years later! Vangelis is indeed a genius when it comes to synthesized musical instrumentation, sounding real and yet unique.  Jon Anderson from the group \\"Yes\\" has always appealed to me with a very distinctive voice.  The album itself is a good mix of easy listening and story telling and with moody interludes that make it an interesting listen.  I would personally recommend this album to anyone who would be adventurous in their music tastes or for those who are familiar with both artists.  After all these years of not having this album in my library its now one of my favourite listens again!
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|Non-full disclosure. I was very disappointed when I opened this up and realized it was the Director's Cut, with score by Jerry Goldsmith. I was looking for the theatrical version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack. The story line is totally different between the two, and I already have the Director's cut, which I didn't want in the first place. I'm sending it back, and I would appreciate it if you could find me the theatrical version to replace it.
1401201911|5.0|I picked this up for two reasons: One, I love Dave Johnson's covers for 100 Bullets and two, the premise seemed interesting.    After reading Superman: Red Son, I realized two things: One, this book is a true classic and two, it has fascinating parallels to an Incredible Hulk story by Peter David, \\"Future Imperfect\\".    In both stories, the main ominpotent/invulnerable characters of their resepctive universes (DC's Superman, Marvel's Hulk) are posed perhaps the most obivous yet complicated question by their writers: What is stopping these unstoppable but heroic beings from taking over Earth?  And once the unstoppable but heroic beings do take over Earth, how do they choose to rule?  The two stories have completely different answers to that question, but both are extremely well written and both also happen to look great, too.     Now maybe this all old hat to many readers and I am (as usual) late to the party.  Nonetheless, this was like finding a hidden treasure on the comic book store shelf.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B001VS46DC|5.0|The mix of Diana's voice and band with the backdrop of Rio is intoxicating. Her beauty and the lush photography of   of the area make this DVD perfect for those of us who adore Ms. Krall.
0446691437|5.0|I was told about this book from a co-worker.  I ordered it and kept it in my bag for several weeks until I had the instinct to begin reading it (procrastination).  What an important manual as an everyday guide.  Resistance exists in everything we do.  In so many different forms.  Seeing it written down makes us responsible for understanding it in real time.  Anyone that struggles with accomplishing anything will benefit from this book.  Read it, re-read it and then reference it regularly.  It will change your thoughts and motivation.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|There is nothing I can say that has not been said in previous reviews. This is the best blu-ray transfer of vintage celluloid that I have ever seen. If you did not know the film was originally released in 1982, you would swear it had been filmed yesterday. The story is a classic, the final cut is perfect, and the extras are plentiful(and worthwhile). If you are a fan of sci-fi, or film in general, you should own this version of the classic.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I have not listened so much to an album since Seldom Seen Kid. It is truly amazing that talent like this can suddenly emerge almost by accident. Lyrics with bite, beautiful music with vocals that go full bore for the senses. Those lucky enough to have seen her live are giving raves and the venerable BBC are pushing her forward.  World look out!
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I have not read the book by this same title. Nor have I watched any of the popular Tudor's series of late.<br /><br />I don't know what's worse...watching a film that is beautiful in scenery, costume and acting not knowing what the outcome will be and hoping for the best, or knowing and having the impotent sense of horror as you watch it all unfold. The film starts with \\"Mr.\\" Boleyn offering his girls to the highest bidder...more or less. Anne (Natalie Portman), the oldest, is requested for marriage. Her father offers her younger, equally beautiful sister Mary, (Scarlett Johansson) instead. She's the nicer of the two and more likely to be content with a mere merchant.<br /><br /> Father is not, he has great ambition for his children. And so the story goes.<br /><br />Mary's marriage conveniently gets set aside on account of the King Henry's (Eric Bana) great need for a male heir and his wife's inability to provide one. When Mary Boleyn is pregnant, the king's eye must not wander away from the tight circle of power that is being woven around him, enter Anne.<br /><br />But Anne has ambition of her own. The madness and horrible outcome unfolds in the absolute worst possible way. The history is fascinating and brutal. As ugly as American politics are today, they are nothing compared to the drama of King Henry's court.<br /><br />There are sex scenes in the film. However, they are more arty that crude. One is disturbing but both partners are shown fully clothed. A couple others are shown quickly and include a naked thigh in profile. Beheadings occur off screen. There is no language warning. The lighting was sometimes a little dark. And more than one scene change made me pause to figure out what had just happened.<br /><br />Definitely worth the rental in my book. But a little depressing to keep in my permanent library, but if I can find it for a decent price I might. It felt very much like  Girl With a Pearl Earring and a little like Marie Antoinette. Fans of either or both would probably like Other Boleyn.
B000002GZ1|4.0|A few years ago, I caught the Chicago Blues Reunion tour with Nick Gravenites, Sam Lay, Barry Goldberg, Tracy Nelson, Corky Siegel and Harvey Mandel. I was there as a Tracy fan, I gotta admit, but I had lots and lots of respect for the guys in the band too, most living legends of the \\"Fathers and Sons\\" era.      That revue band often opened their shows w/ Nick Graventites \\"Born In Chicago,\\" which I knew sounded awfully familiar, but I was struggling to place it.  I figured I must have heard Nick the Greek do it in some earlier incarnation.    But actually, of course, it was from the classic 1965 debut album by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band.  I stumbled across that record and its follow up EAST/WEST a few years later, and was the proud owner of both for a while (who knows where they disappeared to, it was the 60s after all).    So why didn't I remember the song.  Well, it's a pretty good blues tune--a bit heavy on the bravado, lyrically, but really OK--but I gotta admit that while I had more than passing interest in urban blues, I was really much more impressed with the more obvious experimentalism of EAST-WEST (which I actually may have heard first, come to think of it).    Yeah, I preferred Cream to John Mayall too.    But that was then.  Now I find myself listening to this and some of the other earnest efforts by young white bluesmen of the era and hearing it all w/ new ears as it were.  This straightforward Chicago style blues sounds awfully good to me now.  And even though EAST-WEST was a relatively bold experiment, there's a something to be said for sticking to your roots (but, of course, in those heady times no one was: there was just too much to check out, to explore and to absorb).    You know the original liner notes (included here) have all the pretensions of the times (more verbiage spent than even I'm wont to do).  But the gist of Pete Welding's commentary is actually dead-on accurate and true.  By embracing contemporary URBAN blues, Butterfield andco. avoided the traps and trappings that undercut other white blues singers who were embracing acoustic, country blues.  They didn't have to deal quite so much with the authenticity question.    Urban kids, of whatever race, doing urban blues made sense.  The reason \\"Born In Chicago\\" SHOULD have stuck in my mind better is that in Butterfield's case, it just happened to be the truth.  Yeah, the breezy machismo of the tune can be a bit irritating, but it makes its statement.  These guys were from the streets of Chicago.  The grit was real, and the playing was damn good.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|This new release did not live up to my expectations. Whitney is an old classic with new paint and chrome but the engine sounds rough.
B000VSBX34|5.0|There is no point to this movie, but hey - it's the Beatles! The plot is silly and a corny spoof off of a James Bond, but hey - it's the Beatles! So what's not to love! The movie is hilarious almost to the point of extremely corny, but it's worth watching. The music \\"videos\\" in the movie are fansatic. \\"The Night Before\\" and \\"Another Girl\\" are definitely my two favorite songs on this awesome soundtrack. After you're done watching the movie, buy the CD and cherish it. Love this movie.
0156030209|5.0|I purchased this book because I saw how many copies had been sold and figured it must be a pretty good read! About 1/4 of the way in, I was pleasantly surprised at what a great read it became. The first quarter reads much like a classic, something you'd be forced to read for your high school reading list, and takes a little determination to plow through. But the meat of the story, consisting of Pi's journeys on the sea, is excellent. To be honest, I was disappointed when the book was complete. For something that seemed a bit fantastical and odd at first glance, this was a superb read that I would recommend to anyone.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|One of the best SciFi's I have seen in recent years. This was a rental based on a few reviews at Netflix and a pleasant surprise it turned out. Many of the recent films of this genre lack story and character development, but this does not suffer that as much. The hero doesn't seem quite right at first and Ron Perlman is underused, but otherwise fairly well cast and acted. The special effects actually didn't make me laugh at all, which can't be said for many SciFi movies being released recently. The back story when viewed is actually good and leaves us feeling some sympathy for the beast. The Vikings are believable and the costumes, sets, and weapons go a long way in bringing us into that realm. Well worth at least a rental. I am seriously thinking of buying it because of the good replayability and Amazons sell price. If you enjoyed this, catch [[ASIN:6305692688 The 13th Warrior]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B001AQTWF2|1.0|I realize everyone is thrilled to have Whitney back, as am I... but in all that excitement it seems that people are content to settle for anything she delivers. This album is lackluster and far from the superior tracks she has given us in the past. This album is not memorable and her ballads do not tug at your heartstrings. Nothing is memorable. Is is pleasant to listen to? Sure. Is it up to the high standards previously set by her? Definitely not. This album will not be a classic and I personally expected so much more. Her voice is far from what it once was. She now sounds husky and glottal and she has lost that rich soulful smooth sound that once sent chills down your spine. All in all, her voice is still an amazing instrument. This album just doesn't showcase her voice or her talent to it's maximum capability. This album lacks maturity. These songs sound more like something Jennifer Hudson or Beyonce would sing... not Whitney. Once she teams up with the songwriters of the likes of Anita Baker, Gladys Knight, Patti Labelle, Jill Scott, etc... then we'll have the 5 star album we've all been waiting for.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|Neil Young has finally gotten his due, as his first four solo albums have been digitally remastered. You might not notice much of a difference between the two versions, as the original CDs were very well-done, but the bass is boosted and the overall sound slightly louder. However, when you're dealing with an artist who has supported efforts to free Americans jailed in Iran and North Korea on false charges, these things may make a difference. Therefore, by all means, buy this reissue.
B002CAWNEM|4.0|Interesting movie to watch at home not in the movies. As you probably know, the best part is the last 5-10 minutes of the movie.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|The song \\"I Look To You\\" just keeps me crying and the pain in Whitney's voice moved me to tears.  She still has that spirit in her voice that made her so great.  Whitney is the last of the great singers of our generation.  So glad to see her back in great form!  And she is aging beautifully.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|This is an excellent show!  Great story lines and acting. I found myself burned out after watching each episode since they are so intense. I typically watch TV for comic relief and this is not a show for that so as long as you aren't expecting to laugh or feel relaxed after watching it, enjoy the drama! Good stuff!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I loved every minute of this.  The concert from 75 is just great.  The humour, the music, the raw passion it's all there.  The hat took some getting used to and the scrawny underfed look was unusual but you can't help feeling 'man I wish i was there'  The crowds repsonse goes from mild applause at the start to wild cheering by the end.  Loved every minute and so will anyone who has any sort of taste.  The making of BTR was just about the best doco I have ever seen.  The descriptions from all the band members both past and present put you right there in the studio with them.  BS listening to stuff he recorded and rejected is great to watch.  Loved it all and will definately watch again very soon.  Add the original album to all this (which still today is my fave) and you have a great package, worth every penny.  Thanks Boss
1416562605|3.0|From my priviledged existence in a fully first world country, it's a little frightening to think about how people live and work and succeed in other parts of the world.  It would be much easier NOT to read books like this, but we'd be much less enlightened too.  I found some of the text a bit plodding and the characters not always very likeable, but overall, i'm glad to have read this.  The premise seems to be interesting at first, the letter writer and the audience, but in the end, it doesn't seem to have added much value to the storytelling.  It's not exactly refreshing or uplifing, but falls more into the \\"good for you\\" category.
B00129H7VS|2.0|Ordered this set twice. Both times arrived damaged and could not give as a gift.  I sent both back and ordered from Walamart site to store it was even less money. Came in without a mark.  Will not purchase from Amazon again, I think they have gotten cheap on thier packaging.
0307269981|5.0|In many ways the Millenium series is stock standard murder mystery.  But what makes these books so different for me are the incredibly compelling characters.  Liesbeth Salander, of course, will remain an enduring favorite, but the other characters too are so well rounded and knowable and interesting.  This second book in the series reads even faster than the first, partly because you are already invested in the characters and partly because the story itself is more interesting.  The end is a bit fantastical and melodramatic, but not so much as to disrupt my enjoyment.  Now i'm hanging out for the third book and bitterly disappointed there will be no more from this fascinating author.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Honestly I thought the reviews on the blu-ray version were a bit harsh. But after seeing the HD version myself I cannot fathom why anyone would fork over their hard earned cash for something so sub-par. Honestly, Ridley Scott HAD to have known about this..or maybe he just doesn't care about his products anymore? The faces honestly look like something out of a wax museum. Yes, the arrows in the beginning are GONE. Facial close-ups resemble a painting. My Open Matte version is light years aheads of this drek. Please do not give in to such shoddy marksmanship..whomever mastered this abomination should be fired immediately and replaced by an agent who knows what they are doing.    Sad.
1439102813|5.0|I was very pleased with the person who shipped this book.  It had been damaged during shipment.  When I inquired whether it (the damage)was already there, or if it might have happened during shipment, the seller immediately refunded my money, without request.  I was beyond impressed.
B00006BSGZ|5.0|I give 5 stars to this DVD for the 1964 Tosca's place in La Divina's history.  You just must have it!  When you watch it, you will wish you had a DVD of Callas and Gobbi in the entire opera; but you will rejoice that you have even these bits.      At age 41, Callas managed to transform herself into this almost-virginal Tosca, and she is awesome!   She completely subjects her voice to being Tosca.  She infuses incredible pathos and agony most raw into that voice while still doing justice to the music.  That's why she was La Divina.    I personally love Tito Gobbi!  But, even if I didn't, his Scarpia is a visual and aural treat.  While a little long in the tooth, in 1964 Gobbi was still a powerful actor and singer.  His Scarpia is one thousand percent despicable!    Unlike other reviewers, for me the 1962 material is harder to discuss.  This was a difficult time for Callas as a singer.  I want to love it for her and the music; but there we are.  To me, she appears and sounds pressed on a number of fronts.  By 1964, she seemed in better shape.      The package EMI provides us is a disappointment, to say the least.  The notes are scanty and difficult to read.  Tiny gold print on black (!!!!!!) for the first page.  Not much better for the second page--tiny black print on gold.   EMI, what WERE you thinking????
0307388921|2.0|From page one of Choke, you immediately know that Chuck Palahniuk is a great writer.  Unfortunately, while the prose pops and the story moves quickly, this book ultimately goes nowhere.  The story is thin to say the least.  Basically, the plot involves a sex addict's ill-planned quest to be a good son.  However, most of the book really just amounts to Palahniuk describing bizarre sex practices.  Although there are many different ways to tell a story, this ultimately goes nowhere and has little relevance to the plot.  The ending, and the events leading up to it are not worth the time.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Sadly, in an attempt to make James Bond more gritty and down to earth, the producers have made him more common.  It was a good move in Casino Royale to try to anchor Bond more firmly in reality; to take him out of the cartoon realm into which Roger Moore had taken the character years ago. But this movie reduces him by transforming him into a rather brutish character regardless of the fact that he is a motivated by revenge over the death of his lover.    Bond as played by Daniel Craig is taciturn, almost Neanderthal-like, in his killing of people throughout.  This is not to pick a point with Craig's performance, which is excellent.  He has proven a very worthy successor to Connery, who I think was the model Bond.  To take Bond down to this level can certainly be used to justify the heightened level of brutality in this picture. You have to question, though, the direction in which the character is going in subsequent adventures.    Reduced to grunting and sweating and a flat sound-byte monotone as he prepares to kill off his next target may be gritty but its not the suave, cool-headed James Bond that made this franchise so delightful over the years. The producers have succeeded in making him more realistic. They have removed a great amount of the cartoonishness, but at the expense of making him seem oafish. This characterization ultimately diminishes Bond's stature as the dashing, sophisticated super-spy.  It's not a good direction for Bond to be headed, nor consistent with Ian Fleming's portrayal.

B000FVNX2Q|4.0|While it's overall a good calculator, I agree with some of the other reviews. I've had mine for about 3 years and I notice how the keys are inconsistent, some (obviously more heavily used) are getting loose compared to others and I am not a heavy typist by any means. The picture shows the regular model, btw, since the 25th anniversary model has \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" written in a script font just to the right of the display. Made in China, hence the quality issues I'm sure. Shouldn't be given the price point.
B00005JKDR|5.0|REVIEW REPRINTED FROM \\"KIDS' FLICKS (DADS PICKS)\\" BY TOM LAMARR  [...]    \\"Monsters, Inc. saved my life.\\"    So began a recent meeting of Teletubbies Survivors.    The dad continued quietly, glancing down at his hands as he spoke.   \\"Someone gave it to us, used, might even have been on VHS.

Monsters, Inc. has got to be my favorite movie with either John Goodman or Billy Crystal, and that's saying a lot.\\"    \\"Has anyone been to the interactive theater in Disney World?\\" another Survivor asked, showing genuine excitement in her voice.  \\"It's one of the few things they've added in the past ten years.

1601251505|5.0|Dungeons & Dragons has had a long history and has gone thru several versions and many different settings. Unfortunately the games official 4th edition was so different from the previous versions that many gamers almost quit playing. But now Paizo Press has released their Pathfinder edition and it is without a doubt the best version yet. I say this is the \\"true\\" 4th edition because each edition should be an improved version of the last, and Pathfinder is a logical evolution of the 3rd and 3.5 versions of D&D.<br /><br />One of the things that Pathfinder did right was to do an open Beta test of the rules. Yes, they asked us gamers \\"What do you want?\\" instead of telling us how to play. They listened and streamlined many aspects, reworked the races and classes and only added one new stat and it actually makes the game play smoother.<br /><br />Among the best improvements are;<br /><br />Combat Maneuver Bonus and Defense which condenses all the grappling, tripping and other \\"Martial Arts\\" moves into one dice roll.<br /><br />The Core Classes now have no \\"dead\\" levels, you gain something every level and they looked at the most popular Prestige classes and asked \\"what makes this one popular?\\" and then added those special abilities into the core classes.<br />For example; Barbarians get \\"rage power\\" to give them special abilities when raging.<br />Rogues now get lesser Rogue abilities, like those they previously got after 10th level.<br />Fighters get better at using their weapons and armor.<br />Sorcerers gain a Bloodline, with special abilities an bonus spells.<br /><br />There is also an overall power boost since many of the new classes and races from the books of 3.5 edition were a little stronger than the original base classes. All characters get more feats, and since several skills have been combined and cross-class skills have been eliminated, there are more points to spend.

0670916676|4.0|This special slipcase hardcover edition of The Diary of a Young Girl imitates the cover of Anne Frank's original diary.  It is a very sturdy and handsome binding with nice, \\"stick to your fingers\\" type of pages--great for reading and displaying.<br />The text is very bold, big (but not too big--maybe size 14?)and evenly spaced to provide for an easy reading experience.  Though I'm not going to go too much into the diary itself (it's just as the other editions), I can say that I wasn't too big on the first half of her journal entries.<br /><br />This version of the book can only be purchased in Amsterdam, and it cost quite the Euro.  Still, though, after traveling through her house and viewing the actual diary itself, I couldn't resist purchasing the rare (not so rare if you're in Amsterdam) edition of The Diary of a Young Girl.
B002LSE4Q0|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans. Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beingsfear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|REVIEW FROM KIDS' FLIX (DAD'S PICKS) BY TOM LAMARR, [...]    What does comedian Denis Leary have in common with a visit from Uncle Rick?   At least when bringing saber-toothed Diego to life in any of his three Ice Age movies, Leary manages to be likable, funny, and caustic, without once swearing in front of the kids.  Not a single \\"WTF?\\" or any of the other phrases familiar to fans of Leary--and Uncle Rick.  It's an impressive feat by any measure, one seriously deserving of its own WTF.    The rest of the recurring cast--headed by Ray Romanof, John Leguizamo, and starting with the sophomore Meltdown, Queen Latifah--also turn out to be welcome houseguests for both parents and children.  Yet with so many comedians on the bill, it is Scratte, the beleaguered prehistoric squirrel-rat, who gets the biggest laughs from grownups and kids alike, and this entirely through physical humor.  Even as animated characters go, Scratte is very animated.    Meeting the definition of true family entertainment, Ice Age has something for everyone.  With the third installment due soon on DVD, it might be worth seeing winter's first snowy weekend as an excuse to hold an Ice Age film fest.  But don't forget to invite Uncle Rick.  He's a big Leary fan, and he'll want to be there when your twelve year old proclaims, \\"Now, that was [expletive deleted] great.\\"      [...]
B002BX4VEK|5.0|When From Elvis In Memphis  was first released, he had just scored acclaim for his \\"68 Special\\" after years of drifting in the pop music spectrum.He spent the 1960's making movies of declining quality, while newer acts such as The Beatles, Stones, Hendrix and Dylan were expanding the realms of rock in ways that were not forseen in Presley's heyday.The 68' Special reminded the world why he was crowned The King of Rock and Roll.   Recorded and relased in early 1969, From Elvis In Memphis  consolidated his return and brought him his greatest success since his early RCA sides.His new updated sound mixed Rock, country, and R&B and singing with the passion of his Sun Records years.In The Ghetto continues the social conscienceness of If I Could Dream from the 68' Special as he narrates a downward spiral of a lost youth.Only The Strong Survive  and I'm Moving On sounds as passionate as the Jerry Butler  and Hank Snow respective originals.Wearin' That Loved On Look opens the album on a strong note telling his listeners \\"Don't Call This A Comeback\\".Even album tracks as I'll Hold You In My Heart (Till I Can Hold You In My Arms) and True Love Travels On A Gravel Road displays some of his finest vocals ever.  Although not on the album, \\"Suspicious Minds\\" (recorded during the same sessions, included as a bonus track) became not only his 18th and last Number One hit, but one of his greatest 45 singles.Unfortunately as the 1960's ended and the 1970's dawned,the rest of his career would not see the acclaim of 1969 as the stage became his realm until his untimely passing in 1977.In one last grasp,From Elvis In Memphis was his last truly great album.
B0015ABRE2|2.0|When I first saw this show, I thought it was a bit overhyped.  As I continued to watch it though, I really began to enjoy it, and thought that just maybe it was as good as I had been told.  Season 3 really made me ask myself what I ever liked about this show.  It felt like a standard, joe schmoe cop show almost.  Dexter's sister is now an ace detective, Dexter's exploits are not shocking and completely predictable, and the remainder of the cast provides one pointless subplot after another.

0143037757|5.0|In 1989 Vienna was a palimpsest of Europe's past.  Post World War II resettlement was massive.  After World War I boundaries were moved, and after World War II people were moved.  The last DP camp was closed in Germany in 1957.    The fabric of European states was corroded by Nazi and Soviet occupation.  Most states were subject to dual occuations.  Old social and economic elites were liquidated.  To live normally in occupied Europe was to break the law.  The state lost its monopoly of violence, and violence breeds cynicism.  Punishment of collaborators began before the fighting ended.  Austria got off lightly, even though it had been Nazi saturated.  Collective amnesia assisted postwar recovery.      Europe developed a faith in planning.  Material destruction and economic infrastructure was repaired with remarkable speed.  Raw materials rather than war damage impeded recovery in Germany.  The immedite problem after the war was the food supply.  The winter of 1947 was brutally cold.  Significant events and programs promoting or affecting recovery included the Marshall Plan, 1947, the Bretton Woods Agreement establish the IMF and the World Bank, the Berlin crisis of 1948 basically setting up the two Germanies, and the founding of NATO in 1949.      During the war the Soviet Union suffered permanent economic damage.  Afterwards Stalin sought to create contiguous replica states.  Moscow scripted show trials were held in Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.  From 1947 to 1952 the Soviet Bloc was on permanet war footing.  The Communist state was in an undeclared war with its own citizens.  There was cynical quality to Communist misrule.      The collapse of the bloc began in Poland in 1989.  In the 1990's Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus, and the Ukraine became independent of Russia.  Privatization in Russia was shameless.  In Europe in general sub-regions have become increasingly important.      The Epilogue of this complex and wonderfully interesting history discusses how the European countries recognized and drew lessons from the Holocaust and how they came to terms with the facts of their citizens' conduct serving to enable the practice of genocide during the war.  The book as a whole is a fine and detailed treatment of numerous political and economic issues.
0316067598|5.0|Few books have had as big an impact on me as this one did.  I read it on my Kindle and found it hard to put down.  From the story of SEAL training at Coronado to Afhanistan this story flows like SEALS run...fast and steady.  The fact that this story is true only amplifies the emotional impact.<br /><br />After walking through the Pentagon and seeing Michael Murphy's portrait on the wall with his Congressional Medal of Honor it was great to get a first hand accounting of his heroism under fire.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough.

In a world that has many shows that no longer suitable for young children, teens, and even adults it is refreshing to sit down in the evening with my family and watch something that is acceptable, decent, and wholesome for the entire family.    The product in it's style, quality, and durable texture will last hold up for a lifetime.  The value for the amount of money was well worth the price.

0671665707|5.0|Nicholas Pileggi gives us a look into american business before modern Corporate America took over the sure money-maker of Gaming in Las Vegas, the biggest venue of this industry.  Casino really has some juicy details about inner workings of government, gaming, and mob operations and how they work together to make money together. The details are juicy and accurate, or as accurate as they can be, because Pileggi uses actual court document, police reports, and interviews with the players themselves.  What an intriguing mix of hard-tongue business negotians, domestic unrest, and cold-blooded murder.

B00006GFAB|4.0|It is hard to knock a Kiss compilation and that is not my intention. But it is a disk heavily slanted toward the earliest KISS wit a few of the more recent charting songs. No real inspired picks here.    At this point in their career Kiss should have been more adventurous considering this is the 10th compilation disk (including Live stuff). Classics Like the Peter Criss voiced \\"Baby Driver\\", the under appreciated \\"Thrills in the Night\\". More adventurous Gene Simmons songs like \\"Naked City\\", \\"Charisma\\" or the classic metal thunder of \\"Young and Wasted\\" would be preferable to yet another pressing of Strutter.    In the end of it all, KISS will be remembered for the lavish stage shows, but this is a shallow dip into what was probably one of the most adventurous and variety filled rock bands of all time. The problem is that a lot of the songs don't fit into the mold of the visual representation of KISS. The Disco themed classic chart buster that was \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\". The trippy 70's psychedelic adventure of Ace Frehely's \\"Ozone\\". Peter Criss's soulful rendition of the classic \\"Tossin' and Turnin'\\" or the exquisitely dramatic piano ballad \\"I Can't Stop the Rain\\" which puts \\"Beth' to shame and exposes it as the simplistic predecessor that it is.     I may be nit picking as this is an appropriate intro for new listeners, but maybe the rest of us deserve more than a contract filler disk after almost 30 years.

B001EN71CW|3.0|I bought the Firefly Blu-ray after reading tons of rabid fans screaming that it was the best show ever made. I am a big fan of Star Trek TOS and TNG and was excited to find a new exciting show to stimulate the brain as well as entertain. While Firefly is better than most shows on television, it is not the best. I would suggest it to fans of sci-fi looking to see something slightly new, but other than that rent it before you buy.  The Blu-ray quality jumps between really pristine video quality to grainy effects (added for effect). First buyers go Blu.
B002BY77CW|1.0|dont get me wrong i love the hills, and i like lauren's clothing line and everything, but writing is not for her. I did enjoy the start of the book but as things went on i started to feel like i was just reading the hills story plot and instead of using the books charcter names i was using brody and heidi. Jane's character is annoyingly innocent, however i did enjoy scarletts witty remarks that only took place in the first few chapters.  Please L.C. stick to clothes this book is trash.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|This movie has a lot going for it.  Very strong acting performances from all the leading characters.  A pleasant tone with the occasional heart-warming moment.  Engrossing characters.  But the result is a fairly ordinary, well-executed indie-style film that does not live up to its potential.  Pleasant to watch, but not great, or even an exceptional, film.    The film certainly does not live up to any intellectual pretensions it may have, which are probably better handled in the actual book.  The theme of the movie is supposedly that \\"everything is illuminated in light of the past\\".  Those would be better closing lines for a Terminator film than for this one, which only illuminates mysteries of its own creation.  Certainly there are mysteries in the past and flashbacks that leave you guessing at the meaning, but in the end it is the past that is illuminated, and not the present.    So the film gets a solid 3 as an enjoyable movie that is resoundingly mediocre.  Watch it if you want a feel-good movie that doesn't cut too deep or fly too high.  Look elsewhere if you want a high quality or thought-provoking film.

1402756399|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful. Even if you disregard the actual text itself - which one would be a fool to do - the quality of this book is awesome. Strong binding, pleasant typeface, two-column layout, plenty of margin space, text-book quality pages, and of course the abundance of images. This is a book worth keeping on your shelf. The only caveat is that it is large and heavy, making it not very versatile in where and how you read it. If you like to read curled up on a couch holding the book in the air in front of you, this edition is probably not for you.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|\\"I Look To You\\" is a wonderful collection of Ballads, Dance Music and Upbeat Mid Tempo Songs that are celebratory and Positive. Whitney's voice is deeper and richer than it was but still a fabulous instrument. There is a complexity to the song writing that requires multiple listenings to appreciate all of the nuances in the music. This will be another classic Whitney CD and deserves lots of airplay and at the end of the year; A Grammy Award! You will want to listen to these songs for years to come.     Whitney, We're glad you are back to sing to us.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|Overall, I thought this season was great - much better than season 7 but not as spectacular as season 6 (my overall favorite season).  They are finally building up to Lois and Clark and moving past Lana.  The first part of the season was awesome as we finally saw Clark taking a position at the Daily Planet.  The growing flirtation and admiration between Clark and Lois is spectacular.  I also liked that he is inching toward becoming Superman.  The mannerisms that we see in Clark show how he has grown so much from being that high school farmboy in Season 1.  My only complaint was the mid-season Lana arc.  I wish that her story was wrapped up differently and they realized they were not meant for each other rather than they is no way they can physically be together now.  As other have said, this arc took the wind out of a really good first half.    After the Lana arc, the second half of the season in my opinion was great.  Each episode was a must-watch episode for me.  The connection between Davis and the cave walls and incorporating story lines from previous seasons was really quite clever.  I think I was one of the few that even liked the episode of Lois as Stiletto.  I really enjoyed the build-up to the Doomsday fight BUT the final episode opened more questions.  It actually took a second viewing for me to appreciate the final episode as I had a \\"say what?!?!?\\" moment with the fight and events that occur after the fight during my first viewing.  Also, I was not disappointed that the fight with Doomsday only lasted 1-2 minutes.  This fight wasn't supposed to be the colossal one anyway; that happens after Clark becomes Superman.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|...quite how this abomination slipped through Universal's quality control department remains a mystery, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if people have been fired over this disaster. Gladiator is one of their premium catalogue titles and they've made a complete and utter mess of it. It appears they've used the old transfer from 2000 and run it through a grain scrubber (half-a-dozen times by the looks of it), thus eliminating all fine detail. Of course, it wouldn't be the first Blu-ray title to have excessive DNR applied, but scrubbed to the point it actually removes parts of the film? I believe that IS a first. Arrows and fireballs that magically disappear and then re-appear? I know the Romans were a rum bunch but I'm pretty sure they didn't have cloaking technology back in the day.     Just as Sony did with The Fifth Element, Universal need to do a new high-definition transfer and issue a recall notice as a matter of urgency...and for those unlucky folks who've already coughed-up their hard earned, an exchange programme needs to be implemented at Universal's expense.     As an aside, the Braveheart transfer is nothing short of stunning!

0439023491|5.0|Just as Katniss Everdeen is wildly acclaimed as the \\"girl on fire\\", this sequel captures the same sort of appeal. Action packed, adventurous, romantic, unbelievable--everything. If you thought that the first book was amazing, you surely will not be disappointed with it's sequel.<br /><br />In the beginning, Collins takes the reader back into the world of the horribly corrupt and cruel Capitol, who continues to wreak havoc on the lives of the surviving districts in a desolate and futuristic world. It begins with an ordinary scene that re-introduces the characters, but also shows how their victory in the Hunger Games have affected all of them.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta, although awarded lavishly for their win and located in the opulent Victors Village, still retain their humbling and simple natures, yet are forever haunted by the horrors in the Hunger Games. Their relationship is certainly a bit rocky and cold, but only when they are not in front of cameras. Katniss being uncomfortable with relationships is of course thrown off by Peeta's care and concern for her, making her question even her own feelings for him. Collins portrays a very complex relationship between them very wonderfully, making readers everywhere root for them even in the face of crisis and pandemonium.<br /><br />With enough problems on their plates, their situations worsen even more as they fight to survive a challenge even bigger than the Hunger Games itself: the Capitol.<br /><br />Proud and thoroughly pissed that the two victors outsmarted them all, the Capitol fights back at the rebels with an extra mean punch, affecting both their lives, their families, and the lives of the population residing within their district. It's an even more severely terrifying side of the Capitol that never was too exposed in the first one and will leave you loathing the Capitol and opting to join the rebels themselves;)<br /><br />More twists, more turns, more everything! Can't spoil much because that would be wrong, but I literally just finished the book right now and I'm still on a reader's high!<br /><br />Get the book, read it, love it, and yearn hopelessly for the next continuation!ong, but I literally just finished the book right now and I'm still on a reader's high!<br /><br />Get the book, read it, love it, and yearn hopelessly for the next continuation!
1569242739|5.0|Going dairy-free was a big step for me. This recipe book has made it a whole lot easier, and much sweeter! I haven't quite made it to vegan yet, but I plan to get there. My family had no idea these were vegan when I made the first batch (Cookies and Cream Cupcakes), but they loved them. The second batch (Vanilla w/Chocolate Buttercream Frosting)was gobbled up almost exclusively by my teenage son and his friend - neither of whom are veg!    The recipes are very easy, and fool-proof if you follow the directions properly. This is NOT a vegan health food book. It is however a delightfully written, and extremely yummy dessert book. Thank you, thank you Isa & Terry!
0439023491|5.0|Of course you don't. But after receiving this book in the mail today, I got so excited, I immediately plopped down on to the couch (after five minutes of difficulty in opening the package), planning to read the entire book through without any interruptions. Of course, that didn't work out, what with dinner, and phone calls, and such, but I couldn't care less, because this sequel makes me want to explode.<br /><br />In a good way.<br /><br />I have been waiting for this book for such a long time, and so I read the entire book today, the day I got it. And I honestly have on idea where to begin. I don't want to mention any spoilers in this review, but it's not hard not to, so I AM going to mention spoilers from the first book, The Hunger Games, so I wouldn't advise reading this review if you haven't read the first book in the trilogy.<br /><br />So... let's start with the beginning, which isn't really much of a spoiler. Katniss sits in the woods, on the day of the Victory Tour, reflecting on everything that's happened to her since the Games, and all the new developments. She's got so much to juggle on her plate, and, thanks to her new home and new riches, which are all prizes and rewards for winning the last Hunger Games, she's got plenty of time to think about it. Before the Games, she spent all her hours combing the woods, hunting illegally for food, lest she and her family starve to death. Now, with all the newly gained riches, she doesn't need to hunt. With all that time left over, all she can think about is how complicated her life has gotten since the Games.<br /><br />And that same day, just before the Victory Tour, she gets a surprise visitor, and, suddenly, things get even more complicated, but now, they get dangerous, and not just for her, but her family and friends, who could be killed if she makes one wrong move during the Tour.<br /><br />Okay, enough with the summarizing, let's get to the review. Since the last book left off where it did, I was immediately hooked upon this book, clinging to every detail, reading so fast, I had to go back a couple of times so that I could understand a sentence. And starting from the end of Chapter 1, things started to get interesting (remember the surprise visitor?). This entire book is nothing but twists and turns that readers can hardly anticipate. I'm continually impressed by Ms. Collins and her ability to lead the readers one way, but suddenly throw them off completely by introducing yet another startling... er... revelation? At any rate, this book moves along so quickly (especially in the second half) and for some reason, the humor just gets cranked up and I can't help laughing, especially at the interviews, though they weren't really that funny (don't dwell too much on that last part of the sentence, because there's a tiny spoiler there).<br /><br />Okay, so I'm probably making it sound like I think this book is perfect. It IS extremely well written, the emotions are strongly conveyed, and the reader can easily get lost in to this book. The one confusing thing in the book is how much new characters are introduced. Some are easier to remember, like Plutarch Heavensbee (though I'm not sure if I spelled that right) or Finnick, but others, like Brutus (I'm not even sure if that's the right name), are harder to remember. But if you're not too lazy, it's less confusing when you reread the book (though I haven't done that yet).<br /><br />Okay, and now for the big finish, in both this review, and in Catching Fire. I DID NOT SEE THAT ONE COMING. Okay, maybe, I did, just a little. But still, even if I could've predicted that, it still leaves you in absolute shock, making you stare at the book, mouth gaping, for at least a full thirty seconds (that is, of course, unless you have a heads-up, like I did). The Hunger Games left off at the train station, with Katniss confused about her feelings towards Peeta. CF, on the other hand, well, this leaves off with a total cliffhanger. Not that theHunger Games didn't, but CF is different than THG. What I mean, is that the last sentence in the book reveals something so shocking and astonishing, it's like being doused in water while sleeping - just so abrupt. It is a bit of an odd place to stop the book, but just the fact that... Wow, it's really hard not to say a thing about it, but let's just say that, that it's unexpected.<br /><br />Though it is pretty clever. A sure fire way to get people to read the next book, unless people hate this one. But with a cliffhanger like that, even if I hated this book, I would feel compelled to read the next book, because I would never be able to keep myself hanging like that. It's like I NEED to read the next book because, if I don't, I'll forever wonder what in the world just happened. Five stars for being witty, well-written, unexpected, and overall, just wonderful.Hunger Games didn't, but CF is different than THG.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|After years of almost secret worship predominantly by sci fi fans, Blade Runner should be regarded finally by critics and mainstream movie fans alike as a masterpiece.<br /><br />Blade Runner is a film best savored over multiple viewings. Happily, this DVD set (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) includes four different versions:<br /><br />1982 Theatrical Cut (U.S.)<br />1982 International Cut<br />1992 Director's Cut<br />2007 Final Cut<br /><br />Not to mention multiple commentaries (3) on the Final Cut.<br /><br />Perhaps it is fitting that a movie which was so difficult to make (see \\"Dangerous Days\\" documentary) would take so much time to find the respect it deserves.<br /><br />It's a detective story unlike others, and takes place in a future that seems very familiar. Unbelievably stellar supporting cast, and probably the last great special effects movie *not* to use CGI (and it's so much better for the use of in-camera FX).<br /><br />On the 25th anniversary of the film's premiere, Warner, Ridley Scott, and just about everyone involved with the production worked together to produce this definitive release. There were 2-, 4-, and 5-disc collections available, and this 4-disc set is the best deal in my opinion. Much cheaper than the 5-disc extravaganza with all the props and goodies, it contains everything worthwhile with the exception of the workprint disc.<br /><br />I won't ruin your enjoyment with talk about the differences among the different versions. But probably it's best to start with the Final Cut, then watch the documentary (DANGEROUS DAYS: MAKING BLADE RUNNER), then you can wade into the earlier cuts and also the commentaries.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A few years ago I was bored and browsing Amazon's top 25 DVD list for something new to watch and Firefly caught my eye.  At that time it already had thousands of 5 star reviews to its name and I'd never even heard of the series!  Being a Science Fiction and Fantasy fan, I promptly ordered it because if I hated it I could obviously get rid of it pretty easily.  Since then, I've re-sold or traded the vast majority of the DVDs that I've purchased over the years but Firefly (and its full length companion film \\"Serenity\\") still occupies a permanent place in my private collection.  What's more, I've actually watched the entire series (as well as the film) at least 3 times in its entirety.  That's a first!<br /><br />Seems that I wasn't the only person who missed this fabulous series when it was part of the Fox lineup.  Created by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) it enjoys an original premise, extremely smart writing and a cast of talented regulars with great chemistry.  Given the boot after only 14 episodes (some of which were never aired as part of the original series) by some brainiac executive at Fox, it lives on in perpetuity as a cult classic.  SciFi channel (now SyFy or some such nonsense)often airs the series as a special weekend marathon.<br /><br />Give it a whirl.  You may find yourself wearing a Brown Coat like the rest of us!
0307454541|3.0|This is a book with two main plots: (1) financial investigative journalist has been bested in libel court by a business tycoon who has succeeded in turning the tables, making our protagonist out to be a shoddy muckraker in the eyes of the public, and (2) a mystery in which our valiant protagonist has been hired by the tycoon's mortal business enemy to solve the mysterious disappearance of his own niece 40 years ago. In the end, plot one is by far the less successful of the two.<br /><br />Following his loss in libel court again business powerhouse Wennerstrom, journalist Mikal Blomkvist is lured away from his home town to a remote area of northern Sweden and the little village of Hedeby where elderly CEO Henrik Vanger hands him the mission of solving the mystery of his beloved niece's disappearance (and presumed murder) in 1966. Why would a journalist accept this commission? Because Vanger says he has dirt on his enemy Wennerstrom. If Blomkvist does a good job for the next year, Vanger will supply the damaging info to Blomkvist who can use it to restore his good name. Why would Vanger hire an investigative business journalist to solve a murder that law enforcement never could? It's not obvious.<br /><br />While Blomkvist evaluates all of the assembled evidence and gets to know the eccentric Vanger family (almost all of whom continue to live in Hedeby), a parallel narrative is taking place in which we are introduced to the eponymous \\"tattooed girl\\", Lisbeth Salander. She's a complete misanthrope and social outcast, operating on the fringes of society and a computer genius. She doesn't know how to socially interact with other humans, but she can hack the microchip in your refrigerator to discover when you last bought milk...remotely.<br /><br />Eventually, through some plot gyrations, Blomkvist and Salander meet and team up to solve the murder mystery.<br /><br />I've read repeatedly what a page-turner this book was supposed to be, but I gotta tell you, I didn't experience it that way. I don't know if it's the translation from Swedish to English, but this 590 page book didn't really start to move until page 300. That's a lot of exposition and character development to wade through.<br /><br />What's wrong with it? It has a slow as molasses start; Blomkvist is better developed but far less interesting than Salander; Salander is not really believable as a computer hacker; the technology used to extract information from the computers of others borders on the magical...and it's key to how a lot of the plot is advanced; and the business drama regarding Wennerstron is not remotely engaging when compared to the murder mystery (yet the last 60 pages of the book are dedicated to playing it out.)<br /><br />Finally, what about the title of this review? Coffee references abound in this book! Almost every page has a reference to making coffee, offering coffee, and reheating coffee, so much so that it's comical. if this were a required college classics text, there would be a drinking game based on the word \\"coffee\\". I guess there's something about the Swedes that I didn't know: they prize their coffee.w if it's the translation from Swedish to English, but this 590 page book didn't really start to move until page 300.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I first became a fan of Whitney Houstons when she recorded the Dolly Parton classic \\"I Will Always Love You\\". Her voice has always amazed me. There are performers and artists, but first and foremost Whitney is a singer. She has not been named \\"The Voice\\" for nothing as her vocals are some of the most enduring and brilliant of all singers. Miss Houston's new album is her first CD in over seven years and her producer Clive Davis has spent a lot of time picking out songs and producers who can bring out the best in Whitney. \\"I Look To You\\" is a beautiful and heart-wrenching album in many ways. It showcases what Whitney does best which are lovely ballads: two of the best are the title track and the Diane Warren penned \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\". The title track shows Whitney's love for God and how she relies on Him on a daily basis. \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" certainly dramatizes the drama Whitney has gone through in recent years and how she survived to tell it all. Probably the most amazing aspect of the album are Whitney's vocals. She has matured greatly as an artist with this recording. Sure she doesn't sound like she did twenty years ago (no artist does), but not many artists can say they have gone through the hellish moments like her. You can hear the strength in her voice and it is remarkably Whitney. The first single from the album is the up-tempo \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" that has a good beat and is memorable. \\"I Look To You\\" features 13 Grammy winning tracks that will propell Miss Houston back to the top of the charts. Way to go girl...it's nice to have you back where you belong!<br /> \\"I Look To You\\" debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 Album charts in its first week of release selling 305,000 copies! This is Whitney's first #1 album since the soundtrack of \\"The Bodyguard\\" and her first #1 studio album since 1987's \\"Whitney\\".

B000007MVM|2.0|Being a Pink Floyd fan in the 60's (and still am today), I immediately bought this album when it first came out.  Syd Barrett was THE man behind Pink Floyd, or so I thought.  On playing it, and giving it many plays, I was very disappointed.  It was obviously a noble effort by his former bandmates to prop him up.  There are a couple of interesting songs, but aside from some historical value, it's not worth the pain to listen to.  After nearly 40 years since it's release, I thought I'd give it another shot and borrowed it from the library.  My opinion hasn't changed.  I still love Pink Floyd, but this Syd Barrett solo effort, even with the help of his talented friends, is just plain awful.  My advice is to rent it or borrow it before buying.

0307341569|4.0|Meet Libby Day. Her mother and two older sisters were murdered over 20 years ago in a small-town in Kansas. Libby managed to escape into the woods. She then testifies that the killer was her fifteen year old brother, Ben, who was convicted and is still in prison.<br /><br />Libby is no ordinary protagonist. She lost some fingers and toes while hiding in the woods after escaping the killing spree. Her growth was stunted some and she bleaches her red hair blond. She has spent her childhood, moving from family members to foster care families. She descibes herself as mean. She has been living on money that was donated by well-wishers after her family's massacre. Now the money is running out. Libby steals and sleeps with men that are good for a few dinners. When she was younger, Libby wrote a book, profiting from her family's tragedy. But now there is no longer public interest in her history.<br />Enter the Kill Club. They are a group fascinated by violent crimes. Some of there members believe that Ben is innocent and are willing to pay Libby for information, for family memorabilia, and to meet with Ben in jail. They also want her to track down her loser father, the one they believe is the true killer. Libby agrees because she needs the money.<br />The story moves between the present and the days leading up to the crime. While following instructions from the Kill Club, Libby starts to question what really happened that night and whether Ben is innocent. She does know that Ben has lied to her and she is determined to find the truth. Ben's story is told from the past.<br />This thriller was excellent, with lots of plot twists, well-written and enthralling and very, very dark. I read the last half so quickly as I just could not put it down. I never could have predicted the ending, once the truth is revealed. I highly recommend this brilliant crime thriller.
B001QOGY72|3.0|There are a few scenes in TAKING WOODSTOCK that are marvels of logistics.  Director Ang Lee is a master craftsperson, and he manages to make this relatively humble film cross the line from seeming to be an ambitious \\"indie\\" right into the realm of mainstream, studio funded territory.     The film tells the story of Woodstock from the point of view of Elliot Teichberg, a young man who was simply trying to breathe new life into his parents' VERY rundown hotel in the Catskills.  When the event becomes considerably bigger than he ever anticipated, Elliot is swept up in the chaos.  And in the midway point of the film, when Woodstock is underway (but before it has become a mud bog), Elliot hops on the motorcycle of a state trooper and is driven the several miles from his hotel to the farm where the concert is taking place.  The road is clogged with hippies by the many thousands.  Some are just sitting on the side of the road, apparently resigned to getting no further, but at peace with just hanging out.  Others are optimistic about making it.  Still more have set up little roadside stands, where they sell watermelon, or corn or whatever.  We see young families.  We see a surging but peaceful mass of humanity.  The scene is staged to almost feel like one long take, and it is quite impressive.  Technically, it is a logistical marvel.  It's also a quiet but powerful scene.  There is a crush of people, yet no one is upset.  No yelling.  No incessant honking of horns.  The road to Woodstock takes on an almost church-like quality...it feels like these people are on a pilgrimage.  These five minutes or so are among the best moments of pure film craftsmanship of the year.     Unfortunately, TAKING WOODSTOCK gets a lot of things wrong too.  Most crucially, it's all pilgrimage with no payoff.  Elliot (who is a renamed real-life character) never gets close to the concert...he only sees it a couple of times from a GREAT distance.  We see how peacefully eager everyone is to get there.We feel the vibe of \\"hey man, it's cool.\\"  We see this mass of hippies in only a good and noble light.  Yet the film never comes close to helping us understand how Woodstock became a defining moment for a generation.  A touchstone.  A cultural happening that was greater than the sum of its parts.  I may KNOW these things because I read them in the past...but the film doesn't really even seem to try.  Lee is more interested in the far more personal (and frankly, somewhat mundane) journey of Elliot himself.      Elliot (played a bit too woodenly by Demetri Martin) is an aspiring businessman.  In his mid-20s...he wears suits or conservative clothing.  He does not resemble in any way the hippie culture.  He's respected by the older folks in his little town, where he is president of the tiny Chamber of Commerce.  He is clearly under the thumb of his parents...especially his domineering and manipulative mother (played in a broad, stereotypical manner by Imelda Staunton).  He is also, we discover, gay.  And while that fact is clearly important to Elliot (as is keeping it secret)...it is not very important to us.  During the chaos leading up to Woodstock, Elliot meets a handsome roadie with whom he has a bit of a fling.  It's handled as though it's a trivial event...yet we know it's probably a fairly earthshaking moment for the reserved Elliot.  Yet Lee doesn't make it moving for us...just a few throwaway laughs.      Far more successful is the growing relationship between Elliot and his father (Henry Goodman, who also overacts a little...but has a great face and a great deal of warmth).  The two had very little to say to each other as the movie begins.  In fact, dad has little to say to anyone...he's so beaten down by his unsuccessful life.  Yet as these hippies invade his town and his hotel...he finds himself enlivened.  Not only is his business booming, but he thrives in the very open, honest, trusting way he's simply accepted into the nomadic community.  And as his heart opens to these people, it opens towards Elliot as well, and the two come to some nice, comfortable understandings together.  These moments were the only truly, genuinely emotionally affecting points of the film.     Many things happen in the film, and the period details are great.  It IS an interesting story...seeing the farmer Yasgur (a dandy Eugene Levy) negotiate the rent of his land to the promoters.  Seeing Woodstock brainchild Michael Lang (a wonderful Jonathan Groff) ride around on a horse, with an open vest barely covering his bare chest, like Jesus from GODSPELL.  But other moments fall flat.  Emile Hirsch gives a clichéd performance as a cardboard \\"Vietnam vet\\" who has \\"seen terrible things, man.\\"  An extended LSD scene with Martin, Paul Dano & Kelli Garner is flat out boring (when was someone else's drug trip ever really interesting to see on film?).     I had a pleasant time at the film.  The good just outweighs the bad...so I would give the film 3.5 stars.  If I had to put my finger on why the film didn't quite work...I would say it is the script.  I don't know anything personal about James Schamus (who did GREAT work for films such as THE ICE STORM, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN & AUTO FOCUS)...but it feels as though he never really made an emotional connection to the events he was trying to depict.  He crammed in a lot of STUFF...but didn't order it in such a way as to give it meaning.  And Lee, perhaps understanding that the script lacked emotional heft, allows many of his actors to get away with overacting and unspecific characterizations.  It's unlikely you'd regret spending a couple of hours TAKING WOODSTOCK...but it's liable to leave you still waiting for that definitive film on this landmark event.

B001UDYI9K|1.0|...this was painful to listen to. Every APP album has great tracks you want to hear over and over and weaker tracks that you'd rather skip. Imagine an entire disc of the latter. Pull all the lyrics out of a book of self-help poetry for teens and replace most of the instruments with a synthesizer. Record them with off-the-shelf equipment and dispense with the wall-to-wall sound bed. That's this album in a nutshell.     I've liked everything with Alan Parsons' name on it up until now, but this was way below the standard. If you're a completist, buy it, listen to it once for context, then shelve it permanently. If you're a casual fan, save your money. It takes a lot for me to speak out against a favorite, but in this case I have no choice. Sorry, Mr. Woolfson.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I don't recall seeing such a disparity in the reviews of a film.  While there is a large portion of reviewers giving 4 or 5 star reviews, there are nearly as many that give 1 or 2 ratings.  After reading some of the lower rated reviews, I get the impression that most either: (1) were expecting a super-hero movie like Batman, Spiderman, Ironman, etc and/or (2) had not read the book/graphic novel or (3) didn't like the fact that there's a new version coming out around Christmas time.<br /><br />For the most part, the movie actually followed the book more than any other book-to-film I can recall.  The end of the film is changed somewhat, but the result is the same (and a little more believable to me).  I actually saw the theater version first and had numerous questions, so I ordered the book.  After reading and gaining a better understanding of the characters and story-lines (especially of the original Watchmen of the 50s in the story), I then watched the \\"Director's Cut.\\"  I must say that I liked that much better with the additional scenes.  I'm impressed by how much the characters, scenes, and direction come right out of the pages and onto the screen.  Sure, the music selection is okay at best, but everyone has such diverse tastes in music that it would be nearly impossible to please everyone.<br /><br />It's not an uplifting movie by any means.  The result is not to make you feel all warm and fuzzy where the good guys win and everything is right in the world.  For me, it was more down to earth than the romanticized super-hero movies.  It just made me think more than a traditional super-hero movie.  However, it's not for everyone.  With the additional 24 minutes in the Director's Cut, the movie is nearly 3 hours long and some folks may not like the level of drama that builds and unfolds.  Some may call it boring, but I quite enjoyed it.  Certainly not suitable for kids, hence the R rating.  There is some graphic violence and a little nudity.<br /><br />Overall, a must see, but you must like this type of movie if you're going to enjoy it.  Read the other reviews to get other perspectives, there are some great ones here.  I'd also recommend reading the book first.  It jumps around quite a bit, but you'll have a better appreciation for the movie if you do.like this type of movie if you're going to enjoy it.

B000001ESN|5.0|Well it's time to give my age away.  I saw this tour at the old Palladium in NYC as well as Nassau Colliseum.  Besides that, this is one heck of album.  Every track is perfect.  This is a true, start to finish album.  These days I'm into philosophy and movies like \\"The Secret\\" and books like \\"The Logical Meaning of God\\" so the song \\"Free Will\\" has a dramatic impact now more than it ever did before.<br /><br />\\"Natural Science\\" is nothing short of epic.  This is one example why Rush is prog-rock royalty.  Peart's lyrics in this song and throughout the entire album are indeed poetic.  \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is another epic piece of story telling showcasing the musical talent of this trio.  Some of Lifeson's best work is on Permanent Waves.  Peart and Lee are relentless throughout.<br /><br />I never tire of this masterpiece.  This is a must own album.
B0000CDL93|5.0|I have this on DVD, and it's a terrific film that tells about one of the tragedies in American History. November 22, 1963 was the end of the innocence of this country when President Kennedy was assassinated. I wasn't alive at the time, but I've seen alot of footage surrounding this tragedy. I feel that there's cause for both sides....the one where the Warren Report said that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the killing of Kennedy, and the theory that's presented here that there was a second shooter. I honestly don't know how far a bullet can travel from M-1 rifle which I believed Oswald used, so it's possible that Oswald could've been the lone killer considering he was a sharpshooter in the Marines. I also think that there's creedence to there being a second shooter as the film shows the footage of Kennedy's motorcade, and one of the shots looks as though it hits Kennedy by his ear which to me would've been a hard shot for Oswald to pull off from where he positioned himself, so that opens up the possibility that someone stationed closer to ground as it looks like it's a side shot from the grassy knoll, or possibly behind it. As to who actually could've done this besides Oswald may never surface, and I saw an episode on the History Channel where it's been asserted that director Oliver Stone manipulated the footage of Kennedy's motorcade to show that Kennedy was assassinated by someone else. The History Channel asserts that Stone speeded up the footage to add a few extra frames. I assert that perhaps there was someone behind the grassy knoll, and possibly fired a rifle when he heard one go off, but that asks the question if there is another shooter who fired first? This may never be solved in this lifetime.        The actual story within this movie is about the lone trial in which someone is tried for having connections to Kennedy's Assassination, and the actual outcome of the trial was that he was found \\"Not Guilty\\", so that closes the lone attempt to find out the mystery surrounding the murder of President Kennedy. There are still alot of theories out there, but nothing to bring it all together. The film had an all-star crew ranging from John Candy to Kevin Costner. There was also memorable performances from Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, John Larroqutte, Sissy Spacek, and Jack Lemmon, and Walter Matthau. I don't know if this movie won any Oscars, or not, but if not then a grave mistake was made.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|This is an absolutely terrible transfer. It is ridden with edge enhancement (halos on contrasting edges) and severe noise reduction (smoothing the image to reduce film grain -- AND detail). This is so severe that film elements such as arrows and spears in the battle at the beginning are not visible. It's barely an upgrade over DVD, and simply not what a movie of this caliber deserves. It is extremely unfortunate that such an outstanding movie has been treated so poorly. Stick with the DVD and don't buy this blu-ray disc.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie arrived for me in the span of just a few days.  It arrived in mint condition and played beautifully.  Having seen the play several times before I wanted to refresh my memory before going to see it live at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Ga.  It did much more than refresh my memory.  The entire story came back to me in much more detail.  I always pick up on new things never noticed before each time I view this movie.  If you're a fan of musicals, or even if you're not so much, this one is much better than most.  The story is easy to follow. However, it is very risque' so maybe better to watch it while your children are playing elsewhere or sleeping.  Not that they would understand too much of it, but better safe than sorry, I always say.  Great Movie!!!!!

015206396X|5.0|There are not enough words to express how much I loved this book - I did not want it to end. Keeping my fingers and toes crossed there will be a sequel, or better yet, a series.<br /><br />Katsa is the powerful heroine of the story and she is a strong female character. At the beginning of the book, we learn of her \\"Grace,\\" her special ability - she is able to kill anything or anyone. She learned this when she was 11 years old and she tried to fight off the sexual advances of an uncle. Only meaning to stop her uncle from touching her, Katsa killed him with one blow.<br /><br />From that moment on, she became the secret weapon of King Randa, trained to be his assassin. Half way through the book, Katsa undergoes a transformation, discovering a strength of character to match her physical strength. I was spellbound watching Katsa blossom from a bitter little girl to a self-assured young lady.<br /><br />Katsa's eventual romance with Po was heartwarming and very realistic. Although most of the relationship is off screen, parents should give thought to allowing children younger than 14 or 15 read this book. For a 47 year old woman like myself, the romance was captivating.<br /><br />Although I loved the romantical aspects of the book, I think my favorite thing was the genuine friendship Katsa has with her few friends. Her closeness with Raffin, Oll and Giddon, and later Po and Bitterblue, was refreshing. Katza is full of passion and compassion, and although she could kill someone without a single thought, it pleases her to share her talents and teach others how to fight.<br /><br />Cashore is a talented writer and although this is her first novel, I feel sure she will be around for a long time. She has given us believable characters with all their flaws intact and she did something many authors aren't able to do - she made me fall in love with the characters. I cannot recommend this book highly enough! Although I read a library copy, this is one book I must add to my home library.library.
B001EOOQF6|5.0|The second album with Ronnie James Dio was yet another crushing album from the resurrected Black Sabbath! After 2 poor albums with Ozzy (Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die) Black Sabbath was brought back to life for the near perfect \\"Heaven & Hell\\" album in 1980. Although I am in the minority, I actually prefer Dio over Ozzy in Black Sabbath. The way Dio sings OVER the music rather than along with the music (as Ozzy does) just makes Tony Iommi's riffs that much stronger and they stand out even more. I am also in the minority in saying that \\"Mob Rules\\" is better than \\"Heaven & Hell\\" from start to finish. When I first heard this album back in 1990, it quickly became one of my favorite albums of all time! The album starts off with the underrated fast track of \\"Turn Up the Night\\" which is one of the heaviest songs ever written. The song is on par with \\"Neon Night\\" as far as album openers are concerned. The song is full of bass from Geezer and heavy on the riffs. Next up is \\"Voodoo\\" which is a heavy mid paced song that is very catchy and Dio's vocals are very haunting. Great follow up as the second track. \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" is the albums centerpiece so to speak. This song is filled with dramatic twists and turns and is the longest track on the album and very heavy on the doom side. E5150 is ok as an intro but really is just a filler track. \\"Mob Rules\\" is up next and this of course is a fast heavy sing-a-long song. Simple but very catchy. \\"Country Girl\\" is a mid-paced track with a very memorable riff that gets stuck in your head easily. This has a great mid section that is soft and eerie before kicking into a great Iommi solo. \\"Slipping Away\\" sounds like it could have easily been on \\"Heaven & Hell\\" with a melodic chorus and Dio's singing is once again incredible on this track. \\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\\" is probably one of my favorite songs of all time. This song is very climatic like \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" as the song just builds and builds and explodes.Tony's solo is just amazing in this song and probably some of my favorite bass work. Just an incredible and huge song. The album closes with the weakest song titled \\"Over and Over\\" which is a slow paced song. I think they should have had this album end with \\"Falling off the Edge...\\" but still a solid Sabbath song. If you have any doubts about this album, just pick it up and give it a spin. I cannot see how anyone would be let down by this masterpiece!
0307341569|3.0|When Libby Day was seven years old, she was left without a family. Her mother and sisters were all murdered, her brother, Ben was sent to prison with Libby's help. Libby testified that Ben was the murderer.<br /><br />Now twenty-five years later, Ben is set free from prison. Libby still believes that her brother was responsible all those years ago. When Libby is paid to speak as a guest at The Kill Club, a secret group that is obsessed with Libby's family; Libby starts to have doubts about whether Ben is the true killer.<br /><br />I thought that this book was not an ok read. I say this because while I did really like the flash backs as told by Ben and Patty Day, the actions that Libby didn't really interest me. Yes, I did appreciate Libby doing what she did to track down other people who may have been able to help her with the truth in possibility clearing her brother, if he is indeed not the killer. Usually I can't stand books that are written with numerous character points of view but in this story it worked...well. From the book summary and the thoughts of others, it lead me to believe that Dark Places would be right up my alley with the suspense. While this book did have suspense, I found that the suspenseful moments happened more when Patty or Ben were talking, especially when I get to the point of the story, leading right up to the moment before the terrible event happens. Dark Places could have been darker for me.
B001E52O7M|4.0|Very good book. Using case studies and proposing a highly structured process, the authors explain \\"value innovation,\\" which rejects the notion that businesses can compete only through lower prices or product differentiation. Part of the process of identifying \\"blue ocean\\" products and services (think Cirque du Soleil and Curves), however, requires businesses to secure the participation of numerous customers and non-customers, which may be easier said than done. Also, the authors don't include many B2B examples in their case studies.
1573301183|5.0|I have been an AIC fan since I was 2 and a half years old. That is when I first heard Layne's incredible voice...after hearing MITB I was forever hooked on what would become essentially my life on CD. I was too young when unplugged actually happened as I was 9, so getting to see this DVD really means a lot to me. Since MTV only plays reality shows now, we younger generations really do miss the music that came from the 90s. I have grown up loving Layne's voice, and as I got older I began realizing what he was singing about, and eventually I really saw the light on how great he was. I love this DVD because the raw power and emotion Layne has in this is AMAZING. My favorite song has to be Frogs..the way Layne moves back and forth at the end and sings into that mic in his hand...just makes me go crazy!     Layne was a true talent, one who would laugh at his mistakes (like the one in Sludge Factory) and still ends up beating the crap out of every other band that is out there today. As for Layne being on drugs during this, NO he was not, I have done my research and during this time he was actually sober. This was filmed in April, with his ex-fiancee Demri dying in October. It was after HER death he began using again, but I will repeat..he was SOBER during this performance. Yes he might have looked weaker than he was before, more subdued and seemed a little down, but even then, Layne captured the perfect performance. Who cares about Cobain and Nirvana? The real and true lyrical artist was Layne and AIC was the essence of all things 90s.     Truly amazing and a timeless classic for any AIC fan or any fan of GREAT music *which is something we have been missing since 2000*  '  Rest In Peace Layne, and Thank You for Unplugged

0312117337|4.0|I have this deck for several years. When I first bought it, I was attracted by the existence card, I would simply feel peace when I look at it. The other cards I cannot connect to at that time. I feel cheated and wanted to sell them away, but I really like that existence card and several cards like trust. I put it away for years, then one day I take it out again and it seem a totally different deck to me with a very unified theme I can suddenly connect with. This deck is best asked when you have particularly no urgent or practical questions to ask for a \\"solution\\". Asking general questions will give you a total different view on things. These card reminds me into the existence card where each one teaches me to let go of things, not to focus on the problem I asked, then I will feel lighter. It is a very different experience from the other tarot deck. I really love this deck now. But this cannot be my one and only deck. This cannot be a practical deck. But it is so calming and peaceful every time I play with this card. This really teaches a Zen way of life. Only when you have a wider tolerance of perspectives, can you learn to enjoy this Zen deck of life
B001AQTWF2|4.0|This is by no means a brilliant comeback for Ms Houston - the crackpipe has done a job on her vocal chords, however this woman is SINGING.  Yes folks, something that is rare these days with autotune and studio wizardry.  Whitney is a singer, and she does a great job.  The material is fine and I am sure a remix of Million Dollar might catch fire.  This woman needs our support.  (Although I have no idea who designed the package - she looks like she is doing an ad for skincare on the cover).
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Finally, a love story that isn't cliche. A woman who doesn't want the commitment, a guy who is crazy over love, a romantic comedy that doesn't have a stereotypical ending. This movie is all good. The unique filming in random order of days is wonderful and interesting. The filming angles and colors are VERY interesting. All in all a positive movie experience. I recommend it!
B0016HMYEQ|4.0|You like Godzilla?  King Kong?  Any movie featuring a huge critter unleashing destruction upon a metropolis for unknown reasons?  Cloverfield is a great update on the gigantic-monster genre.  I was very impressed by this movie.  It gives you just enough character development at the beginning to let you know who you are traveling with and then, literally, BOOM.  All hell breaks loose and you're in for the ride.  The monster is great, the pacing lets you take a breather between the intense action sequences, and the actors act like real people caught up in extraordinary events.  If you spent Saturday afternoons watching Godzilla munch on Tokyo, don't miss Cloverfield!
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks has done a wonderful job of slowly building the tension in this book. I have not enjoyed a book this much more years.
0385341008|2.0|I see I'm in the minority here. Reading this book at bedtime became a tonic; a few pages of light, plot-free reading lead to sweet, sound sleep. The premise is good and the author, may she rest in peace, was obviously a talented writer. But I found no forward motion, no reason to keep going after about 80 pages. I didn't like the entirely epistolary style, which seemed contrived and, at the beginning, quite confusing.<br /><br />A book with good intentions, it just didn't grab me. And mark my words, in two or three years it will be a charming movie and I will be envious beyond words.

B001FB4W0M|5.0|Revised for the Blu-ray:<br /><br />Dean returns from Hell a changed man. Suddenly he finds he's working for God; An angel named Castiel brings Dean back because he has a mission for him--to stop the seventh seal from being broken and allowing Satan to roam free. Dean IS on a mission from God he just doesn't know all the details yet.<br /><br />The fourth season saw major changes in store for Sam and Dean Winchester. Creator/producer and writer Eric Kripke begins winding up his five year story arc for the Winchester brothers and their constant battle with demons and evil. During the fourth season--one fo the best by the way--Sam and Dean have to stop something that is killing angels, have a close encounter with movie monsters that have come to life and Dean gets to meet his grandfather and grandmother when he gets thrown into the past.<br /><br />The direction is top notch as are the production values (in fact I can only think of one other fantasy/horror series that looks as good as \\"Supernatural\\" and that's \\"Fringe\\" which also had a strong first season). We get a trio of commentary tracks, a number of very good featurettes including one that focuses on the mythology of the series, a gag reel and deleted scenes.<br /><br />I had the DVD before returning it (and being able to get the Blu-ray instead). The DVD looks quite good with nice detail, colors, etc. BUT the Blu-ray looks truly stunning. The only flaw is the menu for the Blu-ray. For some reason everytime you jump past the ads you're taken to the \\"special features\\" menu and you can have a hard time getting back to the main menu. It's a bit sloppy in terms of the Blu-ray authoring but otherwise it is a terrific set. The show looks intentionally grainy with colors often washed out (it's just the look of the show).<br /><br />Over all this is probably the strongest season of the show to date with gore, scary episodes and--yep--off beat sarcastic humor.
1416562605|5.0|A very good book to learn more about the age-old struggle of rich and poor, as told from the view of a servant class young man, who works himself up through various conniving into a coveted position of driving for a rich countryman. It is a very educational treatise on the present conditions of the rich, the poor, and the unscrupulous (both classes) in modern day India. Having spent a few years living in Java Indonesia (India East) among both classes, I can vouch for the authenticity. The poor, as the book points out,  are essentially trapped in their condition - in the \\"rooster cage\\", as the young man puts it. He spends the last half of the book in a sometimes surreal tension caused by his soul yearning freedom and his upbringing counseling loyal servitude. At one point a water buffalo seems to counsel him to stay in his class for the sake of his family. The turning point was when on a trip to the zoo, a caged rare white tiger looked him in the eye and seemed to tell him, \\"get out,for me\\" - a vision so strong, he fainted. How he finally gets the courage to murder his kind master, take his payoff money, and use it to bribe his way to a very successful contract taxi company (serving the burgeoning outsourcing industry), makes a tension-filled, and thought provoking end to the book. The author uses a very creative device of telling the whole story in a long letter from our hero to the Premier of China, who was coming to India to learn more about the entrepreneurism of India. Our hero tells his story with understated humor and heavy irony. A great read!
B001AP11L6|4.0|Proving White as much the distorted pop guitar visionary as Cobain with a case of Blues, Elephant's focused fuzz, emanating endlessly from his twangy, intuitive touch, marks a rehashed retro revival rock scene with class.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Written and directed by Quentin Tarrantino, \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" is a fictitious, visceral story of WW II in which a small group of American Jewish commandos led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine played by  Brad Pitt turn the tables on Hitler and his Nazis. The movie is set in Paris during the German occupation.  Besides Pitt, the major character is the Nazi \\"Jew Hunter\\" Hans Landa played by Austrian actor Christoph Waltz.  Landa is suave, intelligent, shrewd, and deadly. Waltz does an extraordinary job of acting in portraying this difficult character.<br /><br />The movie movies swiftly and held my attention throughout its 150 minutes. The movie is violent and crude with many scenes of beatings, cuttings, and killings.  It captures the brutality of the war.  In the movie, while not in fact, the Nazis get a deserved and swift comeuppance. It is a movie of vengeance.<br /><br />I was engaged with this movie but found it valuable to step back and remember that it is a work of fiction. Some intelligent criticism has suggested that in this film that roles of the Nazis and the Jews has, if not been reversed, at least been somewhat equated. As in some other WW II movies, German top leadership is portrayed as consisting of buffoons. Tragically, WW II did not happen like this.<br /><br />The movie was absorbing, dark, and wrenching but not especially probing.  While the movie is entertaining and sharp on its own terms,  it has little to contribute in helping to understand the horrors of WW II.<br /><br />Robin Friedman
0385340567|2.0|Very disappointed in this book. I've read all the Reacher series, and enjoyed them all, but this one was lacking. I really couldn't stand how he made so many empty threats throughout the novel. He was talking about how tough he was far more than he actually showed it. That was real tiresome. Lee Child mailed this one in, I sure hope it's not a sign of things to come, like with WEB Griffin and Stephen Hunter.
B001NMAFXQ|5.0|Homesick is a music lovers album. Homesick has what you need. Homesick is amazing. I have been listening to ADTR since For Those Who Have Heart was released two and a half years ago. I love both sides of their music. Doing two different kinds of genres on one album is what attracts me to this band. On most of the songs on Homesick ADTR mixes to genres of music into a song,I really like that about them. I think ADTR is going to do great. By the way we are in September 2009 now, Homesick was released in February, and is still on the Billboard 200. I am happy ADTR was on the cover of Alternative Press September issue they deserve it. If you haven't heard any of their music yet you should. Homesick is a must have album of 2009. Homesick is one of my favorite albums of 2009.<br />My favorite songs on Homesick are:<br />1. The Downfall of Us All<br />2. NJ Legion Iced Tea<br />3. Mr. Highway's Thinking About the End<br />4. Welcome to the Family(featuring Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain)<br />5. Holdin' it Down for the Underground<br />6. If It Means a Lot to You(featuring Sierra Kusterbeck of VersaEmerge)

B001DF68MA|5.0|This seat is great.  My child and I are able to talk the entire time we are out on the bike. I did have some problems with installing the mounting brace to the frame of my bike.  There is not enough room near the steering column to mount the brace.  So, this is what I did, because I was not about to give up on this seat.  I bought a pvc pipe that was 1in. dia. with a thick wall (not the 1/8in thin wall).  I cut the pipe about 2 1/2in long and then placed it around the handle bar stem (the part of the handle bars that goes into the frame).  Then I mounting the brace around the pvc and tighten.  Now, tightening the brace on the pvc does tighten down on the handle bar stem alittle, but it acts like a steering stabulizer for me.  We have gone riding 5-6 times at 1 hour to 1.5 hours at a time and a feel that my child is very secured with my modified mounting.

It has a verycynical outlook that could be nihilistic. This film seems to lack the production values of earlier films. Were you happy when it was over? This is more of a cartoon than earlier films.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|I am amazed at the revolt that I am witnessing here. It feels like a health care town hall meeting! I have never seen so many redundant reviews of the same movie, most of them from people who do not even own the blu-ray and are commenting based upon screen shots and others opinions. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is all an organized attempt to get Paramount to re-release this with a better print. Well... good luck with that.    For me, this is not the best looking blu-ray out there, and a classic like this does deserve a better treatment. But it is the finest looking print of this movie. It is beautiful for the most part and whether you can see 11,000 arrows or 10,000 is irrelevant! Now I realize some of you are more perfectionists than I am and have wall sized screens that will show the flaws more than mine. But to label this some kind of travesty is laughable at best.    If you love this movie then you will love this blu-ray. The complaints about the sound are unwarranted. It is the fullest sound I have heard and surpasses the mix of the original DVD. Again, that is my OPINION, so do not flail me over this.     The disc comes with a $10.00 rebate if you own the DVD, so it is hardly a gamble to purchase the movie. Again, if you love the movie, it is time to buy it. If it gets re-released, then buy it again! If you are more interested in wailing against a less than perfect print, then let it go and find something else to complain about.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|All I can say is \\"wow\\" and I haven't finished listening to the whole CD yet. Launch this on a quality sound system, not some whimpy MP3 player. In the current era of American Idol pyrotechnics, monotonal chanting and hip/hop rhythms, we've lost the sense of what a sonic tapestry contemporary music can be. Steven Wilson, in all his incarnations, pushes the envelop with rich layers of 'sound'. His diverse set of collaborators on this album adds even more to his wildly roaming sense of harmonic form. It has been gratifying to see his evolution over the last 20 years. If he keeps it up, he could become the next Peter Gabriel. :-)
0307474275|1.0|This novel has no memorable characters, none that I care about.  It reads like an adult Nancy Drew mystery, and in the end, is little more than a boring entertainment.  Dan Brown should take lessons from Ken Follett on how to write an engaging suspense novel.<br /><br />What confounds me is the public interest in the novel.  Thee must be 10,000 midlist novels that tell a better story, books written by authors who can't afford to quit their day jobs.  It's all very depressing.  If the average I.Q. in the USA is 100, that means 50% of the population has an I.Q. below average.  Perhaps in the end, that is the answer.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|As mentioned by other reviewers the video transfer of the Blu-ray edition of Gladiator has been reduced to VHS quality and suggest anyone hire's & views before buying but recommend all stay well clear (as this is a lemon) - if you absolutely must have it regardless of quality do so at your own risk. I'm sticking with my DVD edition for now. For more detail on specifics of all the issues see the discussion on the AVS Forum & the review at The Digital Bits - looks like we will all have to wait a couple of years until the studio's concerned with this release (Paramount & Universal) do a new edition and remaster the original without all the excessive DNR, EE, and such! Compared to initial reports of Braveheart this Blu-ray release is clearly a disaster. :-(
B00000JLWW|3.0|I've seen Titanic several times and I keep coming back to the same conclusion: other than Kate Winslet's spot-on treatment, the rest of this film suffers from miscasting and wooden performances that are the cornerstones of a James Cameron film.  It works passably in action flicks like Terminator, but when applied to an 'ageless love story\\" that garnered Oscar hardware in abundance, it suspends disbelief and borders at times on camp.    The biggest miss for me was the casting of Leonardo diCaprio in the lead male role.  Unless you are a twelve-year-old girl, he possesses none of the verve, charisma, or intrigue one would have wanted from the role of Jack.  I kept wishing the part had found its way to a Johnny Depp or Ewan McGregor.  It pushed the bounds of reason to believe that Winslet's character would have been taken with a lightweight like DiCaprio's Jack, who looked plucked from a John Hughes movie.  This isn't a knock against Cameron or diCaprio--I've liked their work in many other venues like Terminator and The Aviator--but here it just felt sophomoric and manipulative.    The supporting characters are cardboard cutouts; no one does or says anything other than what you might expect. Other than diCaprio, that feels like more a function of script than of acting.  Billy Zane poses, broods, and preens--not that he was given a lot to work with. The actress Gloria Stuart playing the old version of Winslet's character I'm sure was a very nice lady, but not for a single second did I believe that she was an older version of Rose.  She appeared to lose her sophistication and zeal for life about the same time she lost her English accent. Kathy Bates makes a nice performance in a throwaway role as the Unsinkable Molly Brown.    The boat looks luminous; the special effects are impeccable.  Watch any \\"inside the set\\" documentary and you realize the care and effort that Cameron took to replicate the vessel and the sinking.  But once you get past that, you are left with a story that suspends belief and borders on cheesy camp.  I felt like a lone voice in that capacity when the movie first came out but over time (perhaps with maturity?) others have started seeing this, too.    The film is definitely worth watching for the cinematography alone, and has several memorable moments, but fifty years from now will it attain high standing among the list of Oscar winners?  More likely it will be wear as a big budget, glitzy vehicle that plays like an updated Poseidon Adventure. Five stars for looks, two stars for story equals three plus stars.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Director Martin Campbell and lead Daniel Craig have done for the Bond genre with \\"Casino Royale\\" what Clint Eastwood did for the Western genre with \\"Unforgiven.\\"  The cartoonishness has been stripped away for a powerfully visceral experience.  I used to think that there could never be another Sean Connery in the part of Bond, but Daniel Craig has now defined the role and is elevated to the status as the best Bond that ever played the part.
0312370849|5.0|I approached [[ASIN:0312370849 Sarah's Key]] as an avid reader and as an historian.  This is one of those truly excellent books that come along every once in a while; I picked it up while looking for something lighter than the nonfiction I've been reading.  It is historical fiction at its best.  Tatiana de Rosnay is spot on with her history and her choice of topic is superb: the inhumane treatment of French Jews by French authorities acting on Nazi orders in July, 1942.  She seamlessly weaves two stories together by alternating chapters until the stories merge.  One story follows Sarah, a Jewish child who escaped the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup but loses her parents and brother, the other, Julia, an American journalist for a French magazine in Paris who is assigned to research and write an article about the roundup.  Julia, having never heard of these events, becomes horrified and mesmerized and continues her research until it informs her life, her marriage and her family.  Wonderful history, characters who really live, an arresting plot, and beautiful prose.

Whitney's \\"I Look to You\\" is already a hit Congrats to Whitney, she is a survivor. Whitney and Mariah will not sound the same they are both older. The more these critics say nasty things in the Daily news or magazines people will continue to buy because the critics look like idiots! And guess what I have bought an extra 2 copies on amazon.com of \\"I Look to You\\". It's too much negativity in the United States we all need to stop this hating and thank God she did not end up like Michael Jackson
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I was first introduced to Diana several uears ago.  Her voice is like an instrument.    She Never misses a note, even when you think she has, she is just sliding or moving to the next note.  I appreciate all kinds of music and styles from country to jazz and all points in between. This being said, I think she is the BEST female singer I have ever heard, bar none.  I consider myself a connoisseur of all beautiful things, but she is the best!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|one of the best albums of  2008, hands down, a new classic from beginning to end.
0545123267|5.0|Obviously, as everyone did, I heard about the big buzz around Shiver. The more i heard about it, and the more i wanted it. The thing is, I'm french, so obviously, the french translation will only be available in October. So i decided to get it in English, because i really really needed to read it! I went through a Twilight craze (Yes, I'm 21 and I really really really loved Twilight!), and i really thought it was going to be the same with Shiver, but in fact, it wasn't. Something was missing.    1/ The book is really great though! I gave it 5 stars because otherwise, it would have been unfair considering the fact I read it really fast, wanting to know how it would end. I won't summurize the story again, you must know the big lines.    2/ We are plunged into a real world that is not so real in fact. Grace's parents are always out, they don't seem to care about her at all, she can do whatever she wants. The story revolves only around Sam and she, and it's kind of a good idea, but i think that by reducing the other character's role, you have to tell a lot about Sam and Grace, which wasn't really done in the book. The whole book is about their being afraid of Sam becoming a wolf again (and never becoming human again) and sometimes, it's too much. We only get to know the bad times, and so few is said about their being happy and in love. The happy moments are too rare.     3/ It's really poetic, and I think that's why you get so much tension between the characters. Nothing is said, most of the time, you only get to read Sam and Grace's thoughts, so in the end, they don't speak much to each other, we know what they think but sometimes, dialogue is missing too. There is unsaid throughout the book, and I think that they should talk more : they don't know each other so well, and that makes their story a little unrealistic at times. On the other hand, what shouldn't be realistic is so well anchered in the human world ! The wolves thing is handled very well, and you can believethat there are people who become wolved because they were bitten ! Well done!    I nearly only pointed out what i was dissapointed about, but really, it's a book worth reading ! Believe me, I'm happy in didn't wait till October for it to be out in France, and i will read Linger as soon as it's out! Go read it!
143915726X|5.0|As the grandmother of a special needs grandchild this book gave me plenty to think about, and cry for.  A totally different aspect of the life of a family with a child who is very ill.  Does anyone ever ask the other kids what they think, feel, or want.  And what about the children that are specifically bred to take care of an existing child.  Parts to order?  And do parents ever think about what they put their children through - the sick, the clone, or the extras.  Very thought provoking.  A must read.  And grab the kleenex.  Bravo for a piece of work that really puts it on the line.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Far and away the best show on television.  For those who are tired of shallow \\"reality\\" shows or the seemingly never ending, unrealistic cookie cutter sagas of CSI Anytown / Law & Order Name-Your-Crime, this show is a true original.  The casting is superb.  Once you've seen the actors in their character roles, you'll forget that they were ever in another series.  The only disappointment is that the seasons are only 13 episodes long and 12 months apart.    Thanks to FX for staying outside the box.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|Plain and simple, it was like watching the movie for the first time.  I sat there with my jaw open at times at how clear the picture was.  Some friends came over and it was all the same reaction, one of them went and bought a blu-ray player the next day.  For the price of this movie you can't help but buy it.  Enjoy.
B001TH16DS|5.0|The picture quality is excellent, never been better.  And you have here the both versions of the series the original and the remastered version with the new digital remastering scenes of the enterprise and their universe, and let me tell you this new digital effects are totally awesome, they give to the series a sense of more reality!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I heard about this DVD workout from a blog whose writer had done it for 30 days and saw noticeable results. I'd been exercising for the last 3 months trying to lose weight after having my 3rd baby Oct of 08.  I work out at home in the early morning before everyone awakens for the day.  I need a workout that is going to keep me motivated and inspired.  The treadmill was losing its luster.  So after reading the reviews on Amazon, I went out and bought the DVD.  I did the workout this morning with the intention of starting with Level 1 for the 20 minute or so duration.  I planned on then walking for 30 minutes on the treadmill.  I didn't get to walk on the treadmill.  This was enough of a workout for me to do for the day.  It was intense, but doable.  I followed along with the modified exercises.  When I couldn't do the jump rope because of sore feet, I jogged in place while doing the jump rope motions with my hands.  I didn't use the hand weights because I don't have any.  I plan on starting out with 3lb weights.      I do understand the concerns in the review. You shouldn't do strength training everyday because recovery is important.  There is an issue with the impact on your body (especially if your larger sized) with the jumping for cardio.  My BMI places me at obese, but I do a lot of high impact jogging on my treadmill while trying to build up endurance and train for a 5K. I feel fit and consider myself an athlete trapped in a fat body.  I am accustomed to the impact and know when to limit myself, but realize there are periods when I should push myself too--as Jillian says.  However, Jillian says there are no modifications for the jumping jacks or jumping rope.  I modified by jogging in place when the jump roping hurt my feet. The intensity varies with how high you bring your legs up. I am sure that trying the routine as demonstrated will get the results sooner, but the point is to find a modification that will still keep you moving in time with the DVD. It was tough to go from standing exercise to floor exercise, but I did the routine for the entire duration because it was nice to be off my feet and do the abs routine.  Done in 20 minutes.  I had extra time to prepare myself and my 3 kids for their day and off to work.    I plan on doing this DVD 3 days a week while alternating with my running-training program. I sense that I will still get good results without doing it every single day.  And I am excited that there are 3 levels that provide variety in one DVD.  Even when I reach Level 3, I plan on using Level 1 on the days when I want mix a variety of training techniques.     Good luck.
0452287588|5.0|Excellent book. One of the 10 best I have read. This book provides the clearest explanation of eastern religions and their relevance for westerners. If you have ever studied Vedanta, Bhuddism, Zen, etc. and still can't grasp the meaning or application of some of the teachings, this book may clear everything up for you.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I watched this show for three and thought it was a decent show, nothing special, just something to watch. Then Season 4 happened. I have never seen a show improve so much in one season like Supernatural did in it's fourth season. The introduction of Castiel and angels made the story feel so much more important. Love almost everything about this season and am very excited for the Fifth and hopefully last season.   Yes I do hope this is the last season. The creator had an idea for 5 seasons and once he completes the story I want the show to finish. I don't want this show to go the route of Smallville and One Tree Hill that just keep going until everyone looses interest.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I don't care much for cards and seldom enjoy movies that revolve around card games. About all I know is that it's usually good to hold aces and always good to have a huge pile of chips in front of you.  Yet, I certainly enjoyed Casino Royale which features a giant-stakes game.      Daniel Craig plays a more \\"human\\" James Bond than those I have seen before. Craig seems more fallible and, therefore, more believable than the other Bonds. As other reviewers have pointed out, Craig is also more of a \\"working class\\" Bond. For example, he says he doesn't give a damn whether his martini is shaken or stirred, thus mocking a trademark line of the former more sophisticated and plastic James Bonds. This is not to imply that Craig portrays a soft Bond. His Bond is a master marksman, street fighter extraordinaire, and brutal assassin.    There's plenty of excitement. Fantastic stunts. The foot chase through the skyscraper construction site is spectacular. The poisoning of Bond is one of the most dramatic sequences ever.    Other Bonds are noted for their seduction of beautiful women. But this Bond convinces us that he's really smitten with the vivacious Vesper Lynd, who was so very effectively portrayed by Eva Green.  There's a touching love story here.    There are elements found in all the 007 films. M is here, but now M is a woman, deftly portrayed by Judi Dench. There's the heartless villain, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who cries blood. There are vintage and high performance cars. Like earlier Bonds, this one uses advanced technology. Beautiful people in the background. Exotic locations.    I earlier saw Quantum of Solace, in which Craig also starred. Quantum is very good, but I think Casino Royale is much better. I have seen perhaps five other Bond movies, and can hardly remember anything about them. They really can't approach the excellence of Casino Royale.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Simply the best album by Michael Jackson ever!  The DVD with the videos is a great bonus!!!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Someone else mentioned that if you embrace the new Whitney, you WILL enjoy the CD...if you are a fan of R&B that is. I agree wholeheartedly. The line up of songs on the CD flow and work with one another for the compete album. I've waited for the longest for Whitney's comeback and I am cheering for her 100%. Also, in listening to the other copycat \\"music\\" that's on the radio now, it's a pleasure to have an old friend (in my head) back! Regardless of ALL she's been through and how she may have \\"crashed down and tumbled\\", she should hold her head high. I hope the media gives Whitney the leeway they've given Britney Spears. A major difference to me is that Whitney Houston still has a sense of class about her regardless of all that we know about her. Those of us who have been on the planet at least three decades have some stuff with us, some stories to tell. This album is coming from that place. If you listen with your heart, you will hear a Whitney that has gone through it but is still standing. It's up tempo w/o being pure pop however there are definitely quite a few songs to groove along with (ie Milliion Dollar Bill and For the Lovers, the album will also make pleasant background music if you are having a casual event (friends over for buffet brunch/appetizers, game night, etc) and want something playing that is pleasant yet won't take away from the conversation. I'm pleased with my purchase
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Espectacular. Watchmen (Director's Cut) (Two-Disc Special Edition + Amazon Digital Bundle + Digital Copy), es una joya. La película completa, sin ediciones y tal cual cómo la había concebido Zack Snyder, es mucho mejor que la versión que vimos en cines. Se las recomeindo. Tiene subtítulos en Español.
B000002GW5|4.0|Many thanks for supplying me with Jackson Browne's \\"Running On Empty\\". It was part of my late sister's LP collection - she was into Jackson Browne long before he became popular in Australia. I couldn't wait to tape it after I first heard it. To me, it's a balanced mixture of country, R & B with some heart wrenching blues.  With songs like \\"Rosie\\", \\"Shaky Town\\" and \\"Stay\\", Jackson Browne just swung open the door on his life to me and said come on in. The songs have lost nothing in 30 years and it re-kindles some wonderful memories for me - Cheers Neil Plevey Brisbane Australia
B00127RAJY|4.0|Haven't lost any weight on this, but have definitely seen more muscle tone. The sections go quickly and you sweat a lot. Dislikes -- DVD won't let you skip the intro, which is long, and after doing this for a month, I know what she said. As with any exercise DVD, hearing the same words to each section gets boring. I recommend this. It is quick and gives you no excuse to not exercise each day. Even at the end of a long work day, I know I can at the very least do session 1 and get exercise in for the day.
0446402397|5.0|This book had everything I have been looking for: suspence, solid plot line, realistic characters and a tid-bit of history. Wonderful.     Recommend: Child 44 Audio book, The Secret Speach (also by Tom Rob Smith)
B002I9Z8B2|1.0|This is not and does not offer the much better director's cut version.  The director's cut version is freely available on DVD, but not on Blu-Ray.  Many other Blu-Ray discs offer both the theatrical and director's cut in the same package, and there's no reason Paramount couldn't do the same thing here.<br /><br />Hopefully, Paramount will eventually release the director's cut on Blu-Ray.  But by not releasing it now, that means you have to buy it twice, once now to enjoy it in HD and the second time to enjoy it the way the director meant it to be.  That could've been easily avoided, but instead Paramount wants to milk us, or something.<br /><br />I'm not buying it.  Hold out for the Director's Cut, which is a more complete film and more deserving of the Blu-Ray treatment, especially in light of Nicholas Meyer's new book about the making of the film.  For now you might be better off buying that book, \\"A View From The Bridge\\", and holding onto your DVD until Paramount makes this right.<br /><br />Edit: For those complaining that I'm giving 1 star to a good movie, I'm reviewing the product, not the film.  I don't have a problem with the original cut of the film, but there's no reason they couldn't deliver the director's cut and the special features included on the director's cut DVD release.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Okay, so I bought this BD release of Gladiator. I spent MY money on a supposed BD version. Well, after three and a half hours of sitting comparing the BD to the DVD. I can officially say that the BD looks maybe a hair better than an upscale of the DVD. This is an abomination. Especially, with a film of this calliber. How could you not go frame by frame and want to get the best picture quality out of the original print. This is the type of film you want to see with 1080p and the best picture possible. How dare they market this as a BluRay release. Very sad. We should all sign a petition, send it to Paramount and demand they re-release this film in all of it's splendor. I will be returning this movie. I could have just watched the DVD and picture wise, not have missed much. However, DTS HD MA is beautiful. That is about it though. So very sad. There is nothing saphire about this. I have seen older movies that have been released on BD that look better. As Maximus rose above in this film, we too should rise above this atrocity and demand a re-release correctly done!
055380684X|4.0|As somebody who coaches soccer teams I was interested in the concept behind this book but without any real knowledge of science, the opening section requires an acceptance of new scientific studies. You take that at face value and then you can enjoy the book. If you don't then you may be put off.    Overall the author has put in a lot of work to research his subject and it makes for a worthwhile read overall. I would recommend it if asked.
0385335997|1.0|This book is so poorly researched that it's a crying shame.  The history of the time could have made up for poor plot lines, no backbone and sheer boredom.  At least if the historical storylines are accurate you can get caught up in \\"believing\\" in the story. But in this case this, the lack of research is glaringly evident.    One quick example.  At one point Claire asks a character when he was born.  1713 is the answer.  Claire than says something about betting her clothes on the chance that 1713 was the Year of the Rat.  OK, so Chinese New Year is in February.  Ms. Gabaladon had two chances to get that right and she missed by a mile.    All respect for her as an historian was lost right there.    And keeping to the story she tells and her lack of follow through... what happened to Gaellie's child?
B001V5ADS2|5.0|This is the very best program on television I've had the pleasure in seeing in years. I am not, nor know anyone who is a meth user but am riveted by this show.<br />AMC's \\"Breaking Bad\\" is extremely well written. The Emmy Brian (\\"Walt, Heizenburg\\") won for best TV actor last year was well earned. I only wish Brian and Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) could both win the Emmy for this seasons top prize, however only one can receive that coveted award.<br />Thanks for listening and Blessy Heart!

B000W7JWUA|5.0|We were a little apprehensive about playing this game when we first got it - there are a lot of rules to learn.  Once we got the hang of it though we were HOOKED on this game and love to play it - the whole family.  It wouldn't be good for younger kids - they wouldn't understand the concepts or have the patience for such a long game.  I would say maybe 10-12 years of age and up would be best.    The game is simple in it's concept - build your cities and villages and roads, trade for what you need with neighbors, avoid attacks by the bad guys, but the different ways you can do it are very complex.  We love that each time you play you can build the game board completely differently so that it's never exactly the same game when you play, and when you add the game additions it really expands the ways you can play.  Playing an entire game can be quite lengthy - our family has spent up to 2 hours playing before (that's with 4 people playing on a very large board), but it's easy to get very involved in the game so you don't notice the time passing.    This game has become a staple for our family game-playing, every weekend we get in a least 1 game of Catan and sometimes more than that.
0441017177|5.0|I just finished reading House of Suns, and was very impressed with the book. Mr. Reynolds has done well with this story and has shown a seeming increase in demand for academic understanding in his readers. I was at once both captivated by the character's text, and challenged to comprehend the physics and other hard-science issues of the story. There even is a tasty nugget of steampunk thrown in as well.    In this story, there are two aspects that stuck out most significantly; they being a result of my past experiences with all of Mr. Reynolds texts. The first is the story's most interesting use of changing points of view between two of the main characters. They would change unannounced between chapters; this continued to bewilder and demand my futher attention as I read. And I just realized that this may be a factor of who the main characters are, where/who they come from. If so, this is a futher interesting development in Mr. Reynolds capacity; one I welcome, as it made it very interesting. The second aspect was the increased emphasis on the temporal/time issues: of the characters, of the environment, and the increasingly advanced physical concepts woven into the storyline. I see this as a science fiction book for scientists; one that expects a certain grasp of physics, or at least the ability to conceptualize its implications (which I had to do on several enjoyable occasions myself; skein drives...uh?).    In summary, this book has reaffirmed my admiration for Mr. Reynolds and his work. This is an essential addition to all Reynolds, hard scifi, and space opera fans. The story, characters, and environment all were very rich, interesting, and mentally stimulating. Shrouds, Absences, oh my. I hope to see more from the Gentian Universe in the future. Truly epic in scale.

B000AYEL1A|5.0|My husband and I have always liked Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristopherson and the clarity of the movie is much better on DVD than on VHS. The service from Amazon was very quick.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Maybe I'm a little wacko, but one of the most important things in a DVD release to me is the packaging (i.e. how well it allows the discs to release without bending). Supernatural is a great show and Season 4 is among the best of the best, so an easy 5 stars in that department. I don't like this style of packaging though because I find it difficult to remove the discs without flexing them. Am I missing some secret removal technique? Now I'm no expert on DVD manufacturing, but it seems that repeat bending would weaken the glue in the middle of the discs, causing them to eventually split apart (delaminate). Maybe it's an evil conspriacy to try and get everyone to buy the same product over and over again, as it wears out prematurely...I dunno.<br /><br />Is anyone else anal about DVD packaging like me? Everyone seems to be fine with it so far, so maybe I'm just a weirdo. I'm fully aware that I have multiple DVD reviews that mainly gripe about packaging, but it's something I think often gets overlooked. I just think that DVD packaging should be standard somehow and that it should have a simple button release system that pops the discs out...you know what I mean. Regardless of the packaging though, buy Season 4 of Supernatual...it's worth it.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|There have been a lot of reviews claiming that the picture quality of the new Gladiator Blu-ray transfer is poor. Not so. Most of these reviews were written before the Blu-ray was released. These Reviewers couldn't be more wrong regarding the transfer. I rented Gladiator from Netflix on the the second of September, and the picture quality of the transfer is superb. The sound quality is even more excellent. This transfer looks better than when I saw Gladiator in the theater, and wipes the floor with the previous two DVD releases. The theatrical version's transfer is the first I watched, then I viewed the extended version. Both are excellent transfers. It just goes to show that rumors are just that, rumors. Wait for the release to hit the market before you falsely review the picture quality or sound quality. It is wrong to make potential, interested buyers cancel their order based on a false claim/rumor. If you like Gladiator, this is a MUST BUY Blu-ray.
B000005Z0G|4.0|Strictly 4 my, is better than 2pacalypse now, still preachy/panther/political, but good songs/collabo with Big Syke in Papaz Song, which you can hear pac's anguish, and the social message about dead beat fathers.  Ice Cube and Ice-T are on here as well. there are alot of good songs.

0060775858|5.0|I've never liked this book really.  Never knew the appeal, but it doesn't matter what I think because my toddler ADORES this book.  He loves to look at the detail in the illustrations and try and find each item that is being goodnight-ed.  He was even the one that noticed that the mouse is in a different location on each page and makes a game of trying to find him (he's got it down pat by now).  He's gotten to the point where I start the sentence but he \\"reads\\" the last word.  So I say \\"good night bears and good night...\\" and he says \\"chairs\\".  Doesn't matter what else is on the reading list for the night (we read three bedtime books each evening), Goodnight Moon is topping the list each night.
0451169514|4.0|Book is ok, But I prefer the movie. This movie very long, graphic and spooky, was scary to watch as a kid growing up, clowns don't scare me,but this guy is terrifying. really creep movie,what can you expect of stephen king?    Beep Beep Richy!!,  \\"They All Float\\"
B0000TB01Y|5.0|In my opinion, Wicked is one of the best shows on Broadway right now.  Most of that has to do with the soundtrack - after all, what's a Broadway musical if it doesn't have solid music underneath it?<br /><br />Without wanting to give too much away, the music of Wicked sets the tone, and heightens the emotion, throughout the entire show.  On this soundtrack, particularly, Idina Menzel is phenomenal as Elphaba, the \\"Wicked\\" Witch of the West.  Her voice matches her character beautifully, and her emotion comes through in every note she sings.<br /><br />Kristin Chenoweth is also amazing as Glinda, the Good Witch.  I can almost guarantee the you'll have \\"Popular\\" stuck in your head for a week, and her character's natural perkiness shines through often.<br /><br />I highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone, whether you are a seasoned Broadway vet, or just getting into musicals.
B000005Z0E|3.0|too political, too anti-whitey, but nonetheless good material and it's pac. The best song is Brenda's Got a Baby about A Woman with no morals.  the first of pac's albums, before he matured and got better . the Best Rapper ever. R.I.P.

0439023491|4.0|Collins has written yet another page turning novel, sequel to the Hunger Games. Many readers have already long predicted the main storyline of Catching Fire, which involves Katniss desperately trying hard not to provoke the Capital more than she has already done by deliberately rigging the rules in the pervious Hunger Games. In addition the Katniss x Peeta x Gail love triangle was more than obvious, creating a predicament of emotions for the main character. Collins cleverly incorporated an intensifying new game known as the \\"Quell\\" hence, tossing the Victors of the Hunger Games once again into hellish depths of the arena. The term \\"Friend and Foe\\" are widely exhibited in the arena, with trust, betrayal, and newfound reasons to live. However, the climax of the story focuses on the outbreaks and rebellions, where each individual character views the situation differently, Katniss wanting to hide, Gail wanting to fight back. It seems the Capital is keeping secrets from the districts of Panama, and for the first time, resistance is not clouded in fear as the Victors of the games, along with a few other connections plot to outsmart the Capital.<br /><br />The heat of the story is focused on rebellion, hence creating an obstacle for Katniss. The Quell, was brief not as absorbing, and did not create the arena atmosphere as the previous book described so well, however that is to be expected because the reader should know it is not the main event of the book.<br />Collins is starting to catch onto a much larger story, and Catching Fire is just the beginning of a bigger picture.
B0027G783W|2.0|I guess I'm not a Moby fan but I could have just as well played the 30 second sampler over and over again, there's little creativity to be found here. Overall this CD makes me think of the musical score for a chick flick.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney sounds great on this new disc.  I love the groovy dance cut \\"Million Dollar Bill\\". It has a good beat.  Her duet with Akon is smooth and romantic.  \\"Like I Never Left\\" is pretty.  Whitney sounds very moving on the title cut.  The piano playing is very good on this song.  Whitney sounds strong on the song \\"Nothin' But Love\\". She gives love to all the people who helped her along the way.  \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" is an autobiographical song.  This is a very empowering song about overcoming obstacles.  \\"Worth It\\" is a nice love song.  \\"Call You Tonight\\" is a song about clicking with someone special.  Whitney can still hit the high notes here.  I Got You is a song about feeling secure in a relationship.  She sings with such confidence throughout this disc like on the tracks \\"Salute\\" and \\"For The Lovers\\".  She loves to sing, and it comes through in the music.  I love the songs on this disc very much.
B000QDPTZ2|5.0|This is a very wonderful record. It seems a little bittersweet, since the group split two years later due to problems in marriage. Nevertheless, it is a mellow listen and quite relaxing. If you are an ABBA fan, or just have a thing for old records, this is a great addition to any collection.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Julie Taymor's \\"Across the Universe\\" succeeds beautifully at telling a love story punctuated by song, while trying to create a modern musical. More than that though, it becomes a captivating, visually striking, moving experience.    There's a wonderful story here by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Jude (Jim Sturgess), a  poor dockworker from Liverpool, ventures to the United States, where he eventually meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood), a teenager from an upper-class family, and they join the anti-war movement when Lucy's brother and Jude's friend  Max (Joe Anderson) gets drafted. And there's a lot more to it than that, bringing in the tales of quirky characters like the shy, lesbian/bisexual Prudence (T.V. Carpio) ready to break out of her shell; the sexy and playful singer Sadie (Dana Fuchs), who dreams she'll make it big someday; the grieving Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy), who finds healing through music.    And beside from the engaging, intertwining stories, Taymor - best known for breathtakingly bringing \\"The Lion King\\" to Broadway - once again provides extraordinary vision. There's beauty throughout, with vibrant colors and stunning visuals: a lively Uncle Sam poster, carrying the Statue of Liberty through the Vietnam jungle, the horrors of a riot, bleeding strawberries.    The musical numbers prove magnificent, ranging from hilarious to tragic, melancholy to hopeful. For those who don't know, \\"Across the Universe\\" uses all Beatles songs to enrich the story. Carpio's beautiful serenade of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" has an unlikely subject. Anderson and Sturgess' fun rendition of \\"With a Little Help From my Friends,\\" brings laughter, especially with the line, \\"Could it be anybody?\\" The chilling \\"Let it Be\\" - with a haunting backdrop - turns beautifully gospel. And that's just a few examples of the many numbers, none of which are bad. More than 30 Beatles songs - in part or in full - are used - some well-known hits, some more obscure - to create a wonderful soundtrack.    The singing's always beautiful and powerful. There's even cameos by Bono (of U2 fame) and Joe Cocker, the man whose version of \\"With a Little Help From my Friends\\" became the popular theme song to the television show, \\"The Wonder Years.\\"    And the performances are solid. Wood brings sweetness, grief and unrelenting passion. Sturgess has the devotion and despair in spades. Anderson's free-spirited, while still allowing the fear and troubles to surface. Carpio shows the yearning and caring nature of her role. Fuchs has that spunky and carefree attitude that turns into bitter loneliness. Luther McCoy's solemn and tender with a lot of soul, especially when he sings or plays the guitar.    \\"Across the Universe\\" becomes an exceptional tribute to the Beatles - indeed, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Olivia Harrison have all lavished praise on it - while telling something much more than a love story, by commenting on what brings people together and tears them apart.
B000O176Q6|5.0|If you love Bruce Lee or just a fan of martial art movies, this is a staple for your collection. I popped it in my PS3 and i was literally rocked. All of what made Bruce Lee famous is in this movie. His screams, poses, and unique style of fighting keeps the movie so interesting for all who watch it. And it also being on Blu-ray makes an awsome movie visual specktacular. buy this movie and just enjoy the jive action of Enter the dragon.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|Director Matthew Vaugn's \\"Stardust\\" provides a fun and quaint adventure, though the plot feels a little like several mini-adventures loosely tied together.    The story - based on the novel by Neil Gaiman and written for the screen by Jane Goldman and Vaughn - is something of a fantasy-imbued fairy tale. Young Tristan (Charlie Cox) vows to bring back a fallen star to Victoria (Sienna Miller) in hopes of winning her love. He travels to a neighboring secret world, where he meets the Yvaine (Claire Daines), the star herself; Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Niro), a pirate infamous for his evil deeds; Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), an evil witch seeking eternal youth, which can be obtained by eating the heart of a fallen star; among others.    The story's both funny and exciting. At times, it seems as if there's a series of great sequences that don't relate to one another very well. Tristan and Victoria's sojourn with Captain Shakespeare, for example, somewhat separates the viewer from the larger story, yet it's still quite entertaining. And, in the end, it's all part of the larger journey, with some minor detours.    The world is imaginative, and Ben Davis' cinematography combined with Gavin Bocquet's production design help add to the beautiful wonder. In this world, stars become human but with a special power that makes many humans envious. Powerful magic creates detailed illusions. Large boats float among the clouds in the sky, where lightning is collected and sold. Sure, there's similarities to other works of fantasy, but there's enough different here to make it seem pretty unique.    Daines is quite good, showing a woman who, at first, is a little haughty and quite annoyed about being knocked from her place in the sky, however, she soon finds a way to open up her heart. She believes and true and unconditional love, seeing it as humans' one redeeming quality. \\"I know a lot about love. I've seen centuries and centuries of it, and it was the only thing that made watching your world bearable,\\" she says, and Daines sell it nicely.    Cox does OK. His part mostly seems of one note, a man clueless about love but determined to find it. He does play that note well enough, though, and there are moments of a multi-layered performance. Another stronger actor might have done a much better job with this role, making the love more real, but Cox doesn't bring down the show either.    Pfeiffer is quite enjoyable as the evil witch, showing pride, vanity and determination. She's disgusted by those she sees as less than herself, which is pretty much everybody. And she's also infuriated as her temporary youth enchantment begins to wear off, and parts of the old, ugly woman she really is starts to show through.    De Niro's very funny, trying hard to appear ruthless because he has a reputation he must live up to. And he's also got a secret that there's more to this evil pirate captain than one might think, and it's a secret that may very well bring lots of giggles. It's certainly not De Niro's best work, but he does it with charm and dignity that it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.    Sure, \\"Stardust\\" gets a little sappy at times, which for some may be a bad thing. But it makes up for that with a good dose of humor, fun adventures and wonderful imagery. And the plot may feel like it was pieced together in a rush, but each of those pieces add a charming element to the tale that would be a shame to lose.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|DVD looks better than vhs, and blueray looks better than dvd, but,watching this one I never notice the media... it is possibly the best western ever produced.  Every time I watch this I come away with a little more...it really makes me think.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|The story line is less traditional than your cop-goes-bad movies. Burke has a great storyline, and Jones and Goodman do really nice work. The backdrop of south Louisiana is wonderful, to boot.

067144901X|5.0|I bought this book a year ago for my now 23 month old son. It quickly became one of his favorites and for the last two months has been such a favorite, he has to sleep with it in his crib at night! (I've tried to send him to bed without it, but he fusses \\"moobaalaa!\\" until i bring it to him!).  The first few times that he had it in bed with him, i heard him over the monitor in the morning \\"reading\\" the book. I almost cried, it was so cute!  It is a great book, fun to read, and actually isn't old, even to me, after reading it 20 billion times!  This is more than i can say for other books, which i admittedly have tried to \\"hide\\" on the bookshelf... I highly recommend this book.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Love this CD.  I listen to it everyday.  I normally listen to heavy metal/alternative music.  This Kings of Leon is more alternative but not so heavy which is great, it satifies any music genre.
1892005034|5.0|a life-changing book. A very good and complete introduction to a compassionate way of communicating and relating not only to other people but also to ourselves so that we can allow the best in us to shine while we constructively work on our unresolved needs.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|...on this CD are the beautiful ballads Whitney is known for. Most of the songs on this thing have a hard beat behind so so vocals. Why not just a piano and/or guitar accompaniment?..or a saxophone even. This cd feels so much like a Mariah copycat to me. Same producer maybe? (smirk) Shame...I love Whitney and I truly wanted to love this CD but, I just don't.     PS Her rendition of the classic, \\"A Song For You\\" is terrible. Just terrible.
B001993Y2C|4.0|Battlestar is a show that stepped up the quality of depth and storytelling in science fiction beyond what has been done before.  The show was gritty, realistic, and the characters were largely complex and unique individuals.  The show caught on very quickly for these reasons, which garnered it a lot of critical acclaim.  One of the factors that made it so popular was its use of modern political and social issues being directly relevant to the story.  Not since the original star trek were so many prevalent issues handled so directly and so well.  Given the great writing, acting, and effects, the show is called great with good reason.    The show chose to end in its fourth season, as it is alleged they wanted to end on a high note, and did not want the show to go on beyond its prime.  While the show as a whole was great, there were some flaws which keep it from being perfect.  For instance, the show provided the audience with a series of questions which were supposed to be answered but never were.  For instance, what was it that triggered all of the four (4) cylons at the end of season three to be pulled to one place, and what triggered them hearing the song?  No answer is given.  Also, why is that tigh and ellen, as cylons, continued to admittedly age, as addressed with adama, though the other final five (5) cylons remained young?  Who caused the nuclear fallout of the cylon home world.  Why when Starbuck returned did she have a brand new ship that showed the way to earth.  The list goes on and on.      Possibly knowing all of these questions couldn't be answered in the final season, including how Starbuck returned, the answer that was given to us was trust in God, though he apparently doesn't like being called that.  While this adds an air of mystery to the show, it also feels a little like a cheap way to wrap up the series but pretend the questions can all be answered.  What about the relics that transported everyone to earth for a brief moment? God.  Why did the star collapse at the exact moment they were at some other relics that showed the way to earth? God.     Though there is a lot unsaid, with some new mysteries added at the last minute, the show was still very good and worthy of being in anyone's collection.  The Blu Ray is great, though the packaging is overly large, and the discs being kept in cardboard seems like an odd choice.  Luckily there are plenty of special features beyond the episodes to watch (though I do not understand why all the webisodes were not included).  Overall, an excellent product that is highly recommended.
B00008PW2D|1.0|The second disc only plays certain episodes. It's very annoying! and I am not happy with this dvd at all!! I will never buy used again.
031606792X|2.0|I'm so disappointed with this one.... I don't want to irritate myself so this is a very short review. It's just boring! I totally waste my time reading the book. Sorry!
0446693804|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an author whose works epitomizes love, devotion, and loyalty.  Most of his books such as his classic, \\"The Notebook\\", flows smoothly and translates well into a drama movie.  His book, \\"A Walk To Remember\\", is my favorite of all his books.  It too translates well into a movie.<br /><br />There are differences between the movie and the book.  The theme is familiar and maybe even common.  The big difference is how he executes and allow the story to be told and flow.  Reading \\"A Walk To Remember\\" is like taking a long pleasant walk.  You tend to feel more refreshed and energized after the walk.<br /><br />There are many books that have differing characters but have a common thread of love.  This book will stand out.  It is Sparks best book.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B002LB4F2U|5.0|Leaves Eyes returns with their third studio album, Njord. I was really looking forward to this CD after hearing the My Destiny EP, but nothing could have prepared me for the pure epic awesome that is Njord. Leaves Eyes has completely outdone themselves with this CD -it's by far their best music so far and -dare I say it? -a masterpiece of modern atmospheric/symphonic/Viking metal.    The same gorgeous, atmospheric music mixed with folk instruments and metal that the band is known for is still here, but they've taken things a step further from My Destiny and Vinland Saga.    The star single here is the catchy, hook-filled \\"My Destiny,\\" which sounds the most like Leaves Eyes' previous songs. The tension between Liv Kristine's angelic vocals and Alexander's deep, gritty grunts is great here without being overdone. \\"Through Our Veins\\" and \\"Take the Devil in Me\\" are also great songs of Viking legend told through bombastic, strong metal laced with Liv's haunting voice. Both of these songs also feature more hook-oriented music that will leave listeners singing them in their heads for days afterward.    My favorite song here is \\"Froya's Theme,\\" with its epic running time of eight and a half minutes, haunting opening bass, sweeping choir parts and the talent of the phenomenal Lingua Mortis Orchestra. This song is the closest thing to a symphony that Leaves Eyes has -and it makes me want more.    Liv's voice sounds stronger here than on any other Leaves Eyes release -plus it seems like they finally found a good mixing balance between the overpowering metal and her comparatively fragile voice. She sounds particularly great on \\"Scarborough Fair.\\" The album version is a vast improvement on the acoustic version on the My Destiny EP -it's really the most creative version of the song I've heard. The metal working and symphonic instruments work perfectly together and frame Liv's voice well. It's doubtful that this version has a different vocal track than the acoustic version, but sounds like it has so much more life. It's amazing what some metal and a backing track can do.    The most interesting thing to note about this album is the lower amount of death grunts from Alexander. It feels like less than previous albums. While fans of his grunts shouldn't despair because there are still plenty of grunting parts in \\"Froya's Theme,\\" \\"My Destiny,\\" \\"Emerald Island\\" and \\"Njord,\\" there isn't as much grunting as expected. While I was perfectly okay with this (since I'm not too big on the growls), other fans will have serious issues with it.    Njord is the best Leaves Eyes album thus far. It's filled with epic metal, sweeping choirs and beautiful vocal work. It's things like this that make me wonder why they aren't more popular in the states.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|The horrible and hysterical exploits of Dexter Morgan, All-American serial killer, continue into a third year. You'd think that with Sgt. Doakes out of the picture, life would be a piece of cake. Think again. An unplanned detour from Harry's code, home life's getting a bit too intense, and an unwelcome new best buddy appears who threatens to screw up Dexter's carefully constructed facade. Equally adept with his wit and his meat cleaver, our hero delivers the goods.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|As someone who watches a lot of movies, and especially loves the dark, dramatic, serious ones that get showered with Oscars, I was excited to see Slumdog Millionaire when it finally arrived on DVD. However after seeing it I was left with the same feeling as There Will Be Blood in 2007--and for those who were blessed with missing that little film, in short I think it will be on \\"The most overhyped of all time\\" list.    After missing it in theaters (I blame limited release and school schedules) I finally rented a copy and sat down to watch the much anticipated and lavishly praised and reviewed film. After all according to the Academy this was the best picture of 2008. It started with a jolt (literally, as electrocuting a teenager's toes was not the kind of beginning I had in mind for a feel-good underdog story) the main character, Jamal I believe, is being tortured by a thug hired by the host of India's \\"Who wants to be a millionaire\\". Yes, you read that right, tortured because he has gotten to 10 million rupees (no slumdog--as they are called--ever has) and the host thinks he is cheating.    The rest of the film is each question being asked of him and subsequent flashback to describe how he came to know which American president appears on the one hundred dollar bill, and so forth.  Oh yes, and how could I forget there is a girl, yes a girl Jamal is pining after the entire movie. She is the on that got away. Mixed in with the flash backs is a story of how Jamal from a small age became an orphan. A slumdog.    I have no criticisms for the technical aspects, the cinematography is wonderful with the camera racing through the claustrophobic streets of overcrowded slums as a small Jamal and his brother race to get away from a cop hard on their heels. My criticism lies in that dreaded feeling (I felt the same in There Will Be Blood) that all movie buffs hate...\\"that's it?\\"     I started to think maybe I missed something. Maybe just maybe I did not quite read into the storyas much as my English professor would have liked; but the more I thought I realized this, just like 2007s There Will Be Blood is another Overhyped, Over-awarded picture that just hit the majority of the critics just right.     Still days after I kept think why, oh why was this so recommended even by regular moviegoers and friends. I remember The Kite Runner a couple years back that failed miserable due to (what many cited in their reviews) the child rape scene. This didn't have it quite that bad, but pouring acid in a 5 year old kid's eyes is pretty disturbing for a \\"happy\\" little guy against insurmountable odds story. So, I thought some more until it hit me...it's all about timing!    In this massive, global economic downturn, academy voters and movie audiences didn't want to see a three hour movie were a previously named \\"sexiest man alive\\" actor ages backwards, or the border-on-pedophilia love affair of a fifteen year old boy and a thirty-some-odd year old female Nazi prison guard. And with the election finally over after almost an entire year of watching debates, reading polls, hearing soaring speeches, and watching a myriad of interviews; let's just say the mood for political dramas weren't exactly the hottest ticket. Especially when the two films in questions were about a disgraced Republican president who lied (sound familiar?) being interviewed and after the infamously entertaining and just as catastrophic Couric/Palin interview that is a tough sell. Oh and the other--an assassination of the first publicly elected gay man (Prop 8 anyone? If one of the most liberal states in the union failed to stop prop 8, how did the studio think they were going to be able to market and sell tickets to the rest of the nation). What audiences wanted was that rags-to-riches romance, a basic plot line that makes Cinderella such an endearing classic. And after watching AIG pay out million dollar retention bonuses with your hard earned tax dollars, came you blame them?
B001GKYBXA|4.0|I, along with many others, feel that Paul works better when he's partnered up with a writing buddy. First there was John, then Elvis Costello(too brief an episode, IMO) and now Youth, the much sought after top-notch producer and monster bassist in Killing Joke. It's not as mysterious and anonymous as the first two albums(the first one arrived unnoticed) as they featured just instrumental pieces. But this isn't Wings by a long shot. This is closer to the lyrical work of Bono, for lack of a better comparison. Many more Paul collaborations, please.
B00002Z88D|1.0|OK...ok.....I love Metallica but this is total garbage.  Glad these days with St. Anger at least they are back in their right minds (that's a joke).  Lets forget this trash not thrash ever happened.  Pathetic pusstallica.  With Metallica written on this its  like a dung log covered in chocolate.....it's still a dung log.  I'm amazed at how many 90's metallica fanboy idiots defend this garbage.  Most people that defend their 90's garbage don't even know the first 4 albums or like them which speaks for itself.  I mean the singing even sucks...but is has since Black I guess.  To bad Metallica went back to the \\"load\\" style with dm and now they are recording with Lou Reed........
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is a very good season for die hard Supernatural fans and even those who aren't. It is still going strong today.  It's a must-have for the collection. The special features are pretty decent as well compared to season 3. But all in all pick this and the others up because with show supposedly coming to a close next season. These will be selling like hot cakes and for a good price too.
B000002HRE|5.0|The sequel to Load.  This is simply another great set of music.  Great sound quality, great performances, great songs, and just a solid album regardless of the image changes etc going on during the early 90's that every band was doing.
0316067598|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read.  It was also the most difficult to read because of what happens. This is not fiction, it is real American heroes who volunteered to serve their country  If you read this book you will always remember Marcus, Danny, Axe, Mikey, and all the others who didn't come home. You will wish as I do, that you could have thanked each of them and their families and told them how amazing they are.
0446579939|5.0|The book was in excellent condition when I received it. Also, I loved the book. I love all of Nicholas Sparks books!!
0439023491|5.0|And I'm spent! After what seemed like an eternity waiting for this book I was up most of the night finishing it. Despite the protests from my brain and eyes this morning, one would have had to pry it out of my cold dead fingers in order to get me to put it down. If you have not read the first book in the series, Hunger Games, stop reading here. Catching Fire joins up with Katniss just a few months after her and Peeta's defying double victory at the 74th annual Hunger Games and they haven't seen much of each other since. Most of the first half of the book follows Katniss through her life as a victor, the changes her District 12 has experienced and the painful pull she feels between her fellow winner and her best friend Gale. Don't take this to mean it's a \\"day in the life\\" of a contest winner. The anxiety and urgency begin almost immediately and will stay with you through to the very last page - and beyond. The action sequences are such a frenzied blur that you feel like you've just watched it on the screen instead of reading it from the page. There was not a lot of the usual . . .<br /><br />[...]
B002DKGWSE|1.0|I really was in the mood to watch a horror film when my husband and I rented this.  I was SO terribly disappointed.  We watched the unrated version and I thought the rape scene was WAY too much.  I'm all for blood and gore but come on.  The rape scene goes on for 5 minutes and I was ready to shut the movie off, but I grabbed the cover of the DVD and read what happens.  I got excited to see what the parents were going to do to these idiots.  I was disappointed, never scared and really thought the movie was just bad.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE!  I really can't believe anyone thought this was a good movie.  Disturbing!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I was blown away by David Cook's first album!  Typically the American Idol winner is toned down into an over-produced, homogenized version of the real singer, but this one is genuine.  I was impressed that David was involved with the writing on almost every song on the CD.  I saw him perfom live recently and unlike most current artists who don't have true talent, he sounds even better live.  He was very entertaining, and even though it was a small venue he was extremely gracious and charming.  I hope he continues to bring us fantastic music in the future!!
1881273156|5.0|This book makes a lot of sense. Like many couples profiled in the book, I too wish I would have known these things earlier. Of all of the marriage books I have read, Dr. Chapman's suggestions seem the most intuitive and practical. I cannot claim that this book has saved my marriage, but I can say that I am sold on giving the suggestions a try. I had never before given much thought to the notion that my wife and I may be expressing love to each other in different ways, each of which goes unnoticed because we don't speak the same love language. While words of affirmation and physical touch may mean a lot to me, it may be that she is craving quality time, one thing I am not always the best at giving her. I highly recommend this book to anyone wondering what happened to the love after marriage.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|The movie Australia would not play when I received it. I have returned it to you, but so far, the only reply I`ve received was concerning a refund for the cost of return postage. Nothing concerning a refund for the movie itself. Thanks for your interest. Martha
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I watched it three times, and my brother watched it two. That's how good the film is. It has to one of the best that Eastwood has ever made and, if this is Eastwood's last film he will act in, a fitting end to a great acting career.
B0019LY5I2|3.0|If the animated show was a part of your childhood and you wish to take a trip down nostalgia lane, then buy the animated set without hesitation . . . because this live action version of the series will disappoint you. Besides the action and stories and military technicalities of this show, I remember loving the interactions of all the different characters and the great chemistry between the friends and romantic couples like Flint and Lady Jay, Destro and the Baroness and especially, Scarlett and Duke. I can only guess that Hasbro has taken leave of its senses because it has recklessly allowed the makers of the film to pull a Bryan Singer and completely change the mythology of this original series. The action scenes were great, the CGI is state of the art, the music is good and the origin story on Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was well done. But, TRAGICALLY, it appears that once they decided to cast Sienna Miller as the Baroness, they must have felt compelled to make her the star of the film which meant making her the female lead heroine opposite the male lead hero, Duke!!! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the current released movie version of this wonderful series omits one of the major components of what made this series wonderful in the first place: the original, established love stories.<br /><br />In the original animated show, Destro is a burly, deep voiced, authorative, powerful character (easy to understand why the Baroness loves him)- more so than the Cobra Commander versus the movie where he is a stringy, funny looking, squeeky voiced old guy with a Scottish accent and a stalker-like attitude toward the Baroness!<br /><br />In the original series, the Baroness, herself, is a deliciously cool and conniving character integral to the workings of the COBRA organization versus the current film which actually starts really well then slams you into a twisted, distracting, boring and idiotic thread where the Baroness is made out to be an American under mind control by the little brother (Cobra Commander) she believed dead, caused by the guy she was engaged to - Duke.<br /><br />In the series, Scarlett is THE number one woman on the Joe Team and in Duke's heart.

031606792X|1.0|Ok so I finally decided to watch the movie. I didn't want to at first because I thought it would be stupid. Then I got bored, and watched it. It wasn't bad! So I decided to buy the books. I had one left...the blasted hardcover(I really hate hardcover books because you always have to take the cover off if you don't want it ruined) Anyway!  I started reading it, and was wondering where the magic went?   I had to read the whole thing otherwise I would have gone crazy..but I was still wondering, what happened?! Why is this so stupid!?  She couldn't think of anything else to write? So she made it about this baby...  It doesn't make sense. Technically if women vampires can't have babies because their eggs are dead, why would a male vampires 'stuff' be alive??!! Doesn't make sense! You can have one but not the other?    Obviously, I didn't like it.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This really is one of the great musicals of our time. The dancing, acting, and singing come together to make a great film. The best thing about the film is that it's clean and happy. I think too many times something has to be edgy and depressing to be considered great in critics' eyes. This movie is definitely worth purchasing.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|i used to pass the channel like it was nothing, but the weird part is i love monsters and demons ect, ect.one day i went to the libary just browsing around the dvd section and found supernatural season 1&2.i went through the seasons like i was possessed the absolute best.The relationship between the brothers is the glue to the show.in my honest opion i think if you watch a season you will love it because you will see the growth of a great television show.

B000NU2CY4|4.0|I was kind of sketchy about buying this release beacause of the negative reviews given by some people here.  However, Bestbuy had this and Braveheart on sale for 22.99 each and you saved ten bucks if you bought both, so thats 35.98 before tax for two new realease.  So I rolled the dice since my DVD copy was lost sometime last year when I moved.  I have to same I am quite impressed by the quality of the Blu-Ray.    In some reviews I've read the arrows are missing from the battle, I assure you they are not, I can't say that every single arrow is there since I never have counted them before, but they are there.  Also the detail in the picture and the sound are great.    Will there be another release?  Who knows, and if it does happen it probably won't happen for awhile so if you want it on Blu-Ray I say get it.  Also another added bonus, if you still have your DVD copy you get a rebate form where they will send you 10 bucks back for mailing in your new recent along with both proof of purchases.

John Rutsey (R.I.P.) is the drummer on this album, although he's nothing to write home about he is a solid timekeeper. This album puts me in the mind set of Zeppelin or early Sabbath, moreso Zeppelin though. Working Man was my farovite track, very Sabbath sounding Tony Iommi would be impressed!!

B0015DROBO|4.0|one of the other reviewers said that the original Swedish title translates into 'men who hate women'. The reviewer wondered if the protagonist, Blomkvist was included in that category.<br /><br />Well, the other reviewer(wish i could find it again among the 400+) is on to something. Blomkvist is a financial journalist who is very proud of his jounalistic integrity. His relations with women -- all of them pretty much Godless indifference to f--- buddies. He's nice and courteous, but really doesn't care about the woman beyond the bedroom. Wishes ex-lovers well, but really is content to bang a married woman and is indifferent to her position or her husband's position. hmmm....<br /><br />oh, but it's okay because he exposes financial crimes.

The End.....near the end of the song at the musical climax, the old mix we hear the band building to the climax and explodes to a creshendo with Robbies feedback guitar work...excellent!<br />  *The new mix brings up Jims vocals and hes just mubbling gibberish like \\"yah..yah...boop..yah...blah...we---oh....\\"<br /><br />Makes it sound like trash..totaly ruins the muisical instrumentation climax.....maybe thats the way the band originally wanted it, but for 40 years we all enjoyed the first mix, now its gone.<br /><br />Over all, great sound....agian....in this day of mp3's.....all couda fit onto 2 CD's and 1 DVD.....oh well.
B000O77SRC|5.0|'Die Hard' is a must see show for anyone who loves action movies.<br /><br />Bruce Willis stars as New York police Officer John McClane.  He and his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) are separated.  She has taken a job transfer to Los Angeles.  John travels to the West Coast to visit her and the kids for the holidays.<br /><br />The trip starts off with an appearance at her company Christmas party.  This international firm is targeted by European terrorists who seize the office during the party.  Officer McClane is not present in the room when the seizure occurs.  When he hears what is going on, he starts targeting the bad guys.<br /><br />This is full of excitement from start to finish.  Willis does a great job as the hero.  Reginald Veljohnson is another great character as LA Police Sgt. Al Powell.  Although Powell is not central to the heroics, he is a good addition to the plot helping to inject a little humor and human touch into the show.<br /><br />This is really a superb show.  If you have not seen it, you are long overdue.

A DVD can hold 2 hours on it with still retaining superb audio/video..why only use half its space??  Elvis and the crew filmed I think 4 complete shows and you also have the rehearsals...no excuse not to make this 2 hours long.<br />Then the DVD case boats of NEW Alternate songs or different takes!<br />Heck the original takes were much better, no wonder thats why they were originally in the film!<br />\\"Patch it Up\\" and \\"Suspicious Minds\\" in the original release were much better performaces!<br />Then they left off what I thot were the the best songs!!!!!!<br />They left out a killer version of \\"Polk Salad Annie: he did in rehearsals at the Casino.<br />They also left out some funny moments.....the first take where Elvis runs through the ballroom and comes back on stage and says \\"you didnt think I'd make it did you??  Either did I!\\"<br />Or on stage where his mic cuts out as hes talking, so he grabs like 4 mics and talks through all of them, then pics out 1 to sing with.<br />They left out \\"Sweet Caroline\\" \\"I just cant help believing (rehearsal version)\\"<br />Gee what else did they leave out.......the song \\"Runaway\\"  \\"Bridge over Troubled water\\".<br />What they kept were just the Kings standards, heartbreak hotel, ect ect.<br />They shouda just took the original film print and remastered it and remixed the sound to 5.1 and includeed BONUS features of the alternate song takes, it wouda been a instant 10!  5 star rating, a must own.<br />Although its still a must-own, it couda been sooooo much better.<br />I do have to say though, if you have a real 5.1 home theater system.......this sounds GREAT...absolutely fantastic, superb!

B0000AUHPG|3.0|The first time I watched this movie was when it arrived at my house.  I was extremely excited because I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood's work with Sergio Leone, and I had heard that this movie was just as good.  The problem was that when I initially put the movie in, it wouldn't play.  After inspecting the disc and the box it came in, I concluded that this box was the result of a huge dumbass's creativity.  The set comes with two discs, but they are stacked one on top of the other, and quite loosely, on a long dock thing.  RIDICULOUS.  When I finally got it to play, I only saw about 60% of the movie because it skipped so much.  Buy it, but buy a copy from a box that serves its purpose and protects the disc.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|Full Disclosure: I am not a trekky. This is actually the first Star Trek anything I have ever seen. Star Trek was a little before my time and never got into it like the many people have.<br /><br />I went to see this movie with an open mind. At first I thought this movie was just outstanding. I loved that they brought back the old Spok and I did enjoy the overall story. However, weeks after seeing it, I realized that I enjoyed it so much because I had just seen Terminator, Wolverine, and Angels & Demons and was INFINITELY disappointed by all of them. Then, under further thought, I realized that I hated Terminator and Wolverine because the writers basically took a big ol' crap on two of the stories that I have grown to love. Now, I know enough of the overall S-Trek stories (my father and older brother were huge fans) to appreciate the impact that S-Trek has on many people. I then realized that if I was one of those people, I would likely be infuriated by this film.<br /><br />From the perspective of someone that has never really been into S-Trek, and was just looking to be entertained this is probably one of the better films of the summer. However, if you are a trekky and have a deep connection with the main characters, then this film could possibly infuriate you.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Quentin Tarantino is back with his much-anticipated World War II epic \\"Inglourious Basterds\\".<br /><br />When I first heard about the project, I imagined Tarantino would make a more serious film about the war with his trademark attention to detail and signature over-the-top violence. As I heard more and more about the project, I was surprised to learn it would be much more tongue in cheek. After watching the film, I was surprised to realize the director sticks pretty closely to the influences that have shaped all of his previous films.<br /><br />The film opens in the early 40s at a farmhouse in the Nazi-Occupied French countryside. A Nazi officer, Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) interrogates a dairy farmer, looking for a Jewish family that has gone missing. Eventually, the Colonel figures things out and orders his men to kill everyone but the oldest daughter, Shoshana escapes. Four years later, Shoshana (Melanie Laurent) is living undercover in Paris and manages a movie theater. A young German soldier, Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) finds himself the poster child of Nazi Germany and is excited to be the center of attention; he fought off an entire platoon of soldiers, shooting from a bell tower, picking them off one by one. Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) has made a film about the hero and wants to hold a huge premiere in Paris, for all of the Nazi elite to revel in. He might even be able to get Hitler to attend. Zoller meets Shoshanna and becomes infatuated with her and tries to pull some strings to get the premiere held at her theater. Shoshanna goes along with the plan, but is shocked to learn Colonel Landa is the head of security for the premiere. Thankfully, he doesn't seem to recognize her and instead seems to be attracted to her. In the meantime, Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) forms an elite squadron of Jewish American soldiers who infiltrate the enemy lines for one reason and one reason only; to hunt some Nazis. He and his men are in the Nazi hunting business and \\"cousin, business is a booming\\". Eventually, the two stories intersect and Raines and his men begin to work with Shoshanna to attempt a very daring assassination attempt.<br /><br />Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is a rollicking roller coaster of a film filled with Tarantino's signature style; the characters frequently have lengthy conversations filled with expertly written dialogue making the scenes both interesting and fun to watch, there are many moments of tribute to the many genres Tarantino grew up with and fell in love with, there is a lot of very graphic violence and some truly hilarious, over the top moments are sprinkled throughout. But \\"Basterds\\" is not a great film. Very good, yes. Great, no.<br /><br />Tarantino often talks about the various films he grew up watching and these films have colored his own projects throughout his career. I think if you gathered a group of 100 people in a room and had them watch many of these films, the majority of the group would walk away before any of the films was done. But Tarantino loves them, idolizes them and is greatly influenced by them. What has always fascinated me about Tarantino is that while he pays homage to these less than spectacular examples of filmmaking, he also elevates this source material. Tarantino takes the ideas but applies his vastly superior writing and cinematography, usually creating a project most people would label as something great, something special. In short, he makes excellent films based on material that most would consider D-Grade.<br /><br />Sure, he has had a couple of missteps, but even these films are fun to watch and a lot better than most of the other movies we are able to see.<br /><br />But when he hits it out of the park, he gets a homerun. Some of my personal favorites \\"Jackie Brown\\", \\"Kill Bill V.1\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" are examples of great writing and directing, but also such purely satisfying cinema experiences, you can't do anything but walk out of the theater giddy with excitement, eager to talk about everyone and everything involved in the film.<br /><br />When he doesn't hit it out of the park (\\"Kill Bill V.2\\", \\"Death Proof\\") there are still moments of pure brilliance to be witnessed. I think the reason I don't find these films so brilliant is because Tarantino seems to be a little too fascinated by his own dialogue at times. It seems to be a little too clever, a little too obtuse and this simply creates films that seem long.<br /><br />\\"Basterds\\" is mostly great, but it does fall victim to Tarantino's infatuation with his own dialogue. And this ultimately makes the film seem too long and dilutes the power of all of the great things going on.<br /><br />In an interview with Charlie Rose, Tarantino stated that one of the conversations in this film runs twenty-two minutes. This is an eternity in a film and needs to be the stuff of legend to make us feel like it is but a second. I'm not sure which scene this is, but there are a few that could qualify. The film opens with a lengthy conversation between Landa and the dairy farmer. As Landa arrives at the dairy farmer's house, he seems to be completely at odds and not at all what we might expect a Nazi officer to act like. But as he quietly questions the farmer, very pleasant in tone, you begin to sense there is an undercurrent of dread. You see it in the farmer's face and actions. You sense it in Landa's every pore. And sure enough, the scene has a terrifying climax.<br /><br />Throughout the film, there are moments like this, in which various characters engage in lengthy conversation, but none really reach the impact of the first scene. I think this is due to a few different factors. First, the film opens with this scene, so it helps to establish much of the rest of the film. And as we watch, there is still a sense of discovery because we don't really know what is going to happen.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is great as Aldo Raine, the Lieutenant from the rural backwoods who leads a group of men through France for some \\"Nahzee huntin'\\". When we first meet Raine, he has gathered his men and lays out their mission for him. He wants them each to collect 100 Nazi scalps. And he isn't referring to a rhetorical scalp either. Pitt plays the character with relish, allowing us to delight in the character's backwoods ways and origin. This is a man who knows what the Nahzee's are doing and he wants to help put a stop to it.<br /><br />His elite group is filled with a group of familiar actors, all of who get a bit lost, but seem to be having fun. B.J. Novak (TV's \\"The Office) and Eli Roth (director of \\"Hostel\\") are the most well known of the group. Soon, the group is running through France, cornering as many German soldiers as possible and interrogating them before dispatching them. Their interrogation is for one reason and one reason only, to find more soldiers and to collect more scalps.<br /><br />Eventually, they connect with Shoshana and realize the benefits of working with her. It's a crazy plan, but they are dealing with crazy people. And they are a little off their rockers as well. It's a good match.<br /><br />One of the many things I love about Tarantino's films is to watch and delight in the rediscovery of a long lost actor or the rejuvenation of an actor's career. Tarantino has always mixed the hot with the curious helping to resurrect the careers of many. In \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" he does less of this. Rod Taylor, a popular actor from the 60s is listed in the credits and I became excited about seeing him again, but his role is really small and I didn't even recognize him when he was on screen. Mike Meyers (yes, \\"Austin Powers\\") shows up as a British Colonel who learns of Raine's campaign in France. But that's about it. The rest of the recognizable names are recognizable because they have been in Tarantino's previous films. This isn't a bad thing, but I was hoping for a rediscovery along the lines of Pam Grier or Robert Forster.<br /><br />\\"Basterds\\" is filled with a lot of great Tarantino-esque stuff and only a little bit of Tarantino excess creating a highly enjoyable, over the top film experience.e first meet Raine, he has gathered his men and lays out their mission for him.

Anyone interested in Woodstock, whether you own the previous music releases or not, should definitely get this new 40th anniversary set.  It's well worth the price.  My only complaints, like others who have reviewed it, are regarding what's missing.  I wouldn't have minded more disks in the set--which could have been done--to include all the stuff that was on the previous Woodstock releases (the first album, \\"Woodstock Two\\", and the 25th Anniversary set) that has mysteriously been left off this set.  For example, the crowd rain chant is not here on the new set, and that is a seminal part of the \\"experience.\\"  We're also missing some of the stage announcements and non-music sound bytes that were on the first two albums.  I understand there was some rights issues for not including some bands (Ten Years After \\"I'm Going Home\\" not included), which is stupid on the band managements' part... but still.  This set *should* have been a compilation--remastered--of everything that had been released before (so we could unload the previous releases at a used shop or on ebay) as well as the new stuff.  I would have welcomed a 10-disk set or even more, it would have been worth it.  That said, the producers of this set should still be complimented on an excellent job of presenting the best possible quality for these historical recordings.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing in every possible way. I wish I had heard of the book series before watching the show because I always prefer to read the book first, but this was very well done. I now own all the books and am enjoying a new and fantastic series. I really like this new take on vampires in society, it puts an interesting twist on old subject and draws people in. Watch this show, read the books, or even better..BOTH! It is defenitely worth it.
0307474275|2.0|On the whole, I thought it was pretty disappointing. Yes it had some (many - too many) close calls, fast chases, with dozens of stereotypical cliches fighting for room on the page. There was some imaginative connect-the-dots stream-of-consciousness plot development which was interesting for minutes at a time.<br /><br />My overall impression was that this was a starter mystery thriller for people who have never read a mystery thriller before. The heavily religious trappings probably lured in a whole group of people who were exposed for the first time to this kind novel. Hopefully it'll be a beginning for them, and they'll move on to the *good* authors.
1401322425|3.0|Overall book was in fair condition.  The book is new but one corner of the front cover was crimped and part of the binding was broken towards the front of the book.  I gave a fair grade.  I thought it would look more new than it was.  It was for a gift not for myself.
B001FB4W0M|3.0|First off, GREAT show, but I'm knocking the Blu-Ray edition down a few stars.  Why? Well, it just doesnt look that much (if at all) better than the standard DVD.  The color pallet for this show has always been dark and subdued but they just don't \\"pop\\" like HD really should.  Sound is standard Dolby 5.1, same as DVD.  I'm not entirely sure that the show is shot in HD?? Anyway, IMHO you'll be just fine with the standard DVD version, save the 15 bucks :)
1573300403|5.0|I purchased this DVD from Amazon.com a month ago. It is one of the best DVD of our collection.  Pictures, sound effects, performances, backgrounds....everything is just perfect.  Michael Jackson is really the best of the best!!! I highly recommend it.
0030565812|5.0|I wanted to write a really long and great review here, but, everything's already been said.  I think the Boston Globe said it best: This should be  mandatory reading for every man alive.    Read it.  You won't regret it.
B001CDLATE|5.0|This was my first purchase of a Blu-Ray disc and wow. If you haven't seen this movie at all, you need to see it number one. But of ANY movie to get on blu-ray, this is it. This movie was shot with a higher resolution lens, all this crazy stuff, just amazing images. One of the best movies you will ever see. Get it on Blu-ray if you are debating whether it's worth it or not.
1433502410|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is a great way to study the Bible. It will help you understand the passages in a more profound way. It's an all-inclusive study Bible that quite compelling. With this book one can go online and explore all its unique online features. There you will find the complete text of the Bible along with all of the study notes.<br /><br />Are you a spiritual retard, or are you developing that very important component of your life?
B002DKGWSE|4.0|The story here is the same as the original version. Two girls are just trying to have some fun by themselfs but they got kidnapped by four sadistic gang members. When the gang members are trought with them, one of the girl's parents find out what happened and they take revenge on them.<br /><br />The only differences between this new version and the original is that the acting is better, the budget is higher, it's more suspenseful, more darker, and more realistic. Of course, the rape scene is not so intense as the 70's version.<br /><br />We have to understand that the 70's version was more like a cheap sexual violent film explotation. The movie only focused on the BRUTAL VIOLENT rape and revenge scenes, so I understand that what Wes Craven was trying to do was to get the public's attention for the first time with a controversial film.<br /><br />If you like good horror films with lot of suspense and some shocking scenes then this one is for you, but if you want to see a SICK HORRIFIC movie with violent sexuality then go for the original 70's version.<br /><br />Adios.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Ask any Incubus fan what their favorite album is and, chances are, you won't get a unanimous answer.  Some people prefer the more electronic and harsher sounds of \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\".  Some people prefer their newer sound on \\"Light Grenades\\".  However, you will most likely hear a lot of answers to the tune of \\"Morning View\\".<br /><br />Arguably Incubus' best CD to date, 2001's \\"Morning View\\", (named after the location of the house they recorded in), was not as loved as it is now when it first arrived on the scene.  Even though the band garnered positive reviews and declarations of them \\"growing up\\" material-wise, Incubus was still running on the fumes of \\"Drive\\" and ended up taking some unfounded and undeserved heat for \\"selling out\\".  Anyone can agree that they changed their sound dramatically but a sell-out they are not.  Guitarist Mike Einziger said it best with this quote: \\"[It] would've been really easy for us to try to replicate certain songs that did well on our last record, which we didn't do. We didn't do anything even remotely close to that. We put pressure on ourselves to make a good record because if none of us were happy with it, we'll all be miserable for the next two years while we're on tour.\\" (source: Wikipedia.org)<br /><br />Listening to \\"Morning View\\" is like taking a deep breath of warm, saltwater air while sitting on top of the mountain depicted on the cover, which was the band's intention all along.  Sometimes the tide comes in a bit rough, (\\"Have You Ever\\", \\"Blood on the Ground\\"), and at other times, the water is quite still and calming, (\\"Aqueous Transmission\\", \\"11 AM\\").  The lyrical content is put together quite nicely and the general tone of the album is a lot more mellow than most of their earlier work.  This is no \\"Make Yourself\\", that's for sure.<br /><br />Frontman Brandon Boyd lets his vocals shine while the rest of the band experiments with many different electic instruments, such as the sitar, djembe, didgeridoo, pipa and Japanese pan flute.  DJ Kilmore lays down a quilt of helpful beats that are so subtle you barely notice they are there, and Einziger, drummer Jose Pasillas II and bassist Dirk Lance complete the framework for one of Incubus' most solid albums to date.<br /><br />Below is a brief description of each track with a numerical rating.  See if you agree.<br /><br />Track 1: Nice to Know You--(8)--a nicely hard-hitting track to start the record, Boyd and co. hit the ground running.  Boyd sings here about waking up from a numbness he's felt for so long.  He feels better today than he has in so long, he can't remember the last time he felt this way.<br /><br />Track 2: Circles--(6)--an okay song about karma, nothing really stands out about this track.  There are definitely some good lyrics here but the musical content is average.<br /><br />Track 3: Wish You Were Here--(9)--a beautiful song about equally missing someone while being happy and peaceful lounging on the beach with a kick-ass guitar riff.  A tender song lyrically with a sucker punch of rock.<br /><br />Track 4: Just a Phase--(7)--a calm song despite its bitter lyrics, Boyd is expressing his disgust over contemporary music.<br /><br />Track 5: 11 AM--(8)--another mellow song that is written about a common topic, (wanting to reverse mistakes you made), but written with such lyrical genius that it breathes fresh life into something otherwise cliched.<br /><br />Track 6: Blood on the Ground--(6)--an angry song about despising someone.  Boyd would rather bite his tongue because blood in his mouth beats blood on the ground, i.e. he would rather hate the subject of the song quietly than start a commotion and say things he can't take back.<br /><br />Track 7: Mexico--(8)--a purely acoustic song, Boyd is giving you one more chance to be there for him or he's high-tailing it out on the first train to Mexico.<br /><br />Track 8: Warning--(9)--this radio-friendly track warns that you should probably start to appreciate life because it's over before you know it.  Do what you can to make yourself happy because if you don't take the time out now to appreciate yourselfm, you'll miss your opportunity.  Incubus took a wonderful approach on this song, which could have turned out \\"emo\\" and angst-ridden but instead promotes a more positive message.<br /><br />Track 9: Echo--(9)--a tribute to the object of Boyd's affection, this mellow track is easy to love and sing along with.  What to do when your biggest fear is the rescue of you?<br /><br />Track 10: Have You Ever--(7)--probably the heaviest track on the album, Boyd is stepping lightly so as not to screw up a relationship with someone he values.  He wants to be blatantly honest with her but is afraid that will end up costing him in the end.<br /><br />Track 11: Are You In?--(9)--an upbeat, catchy tune about conformity.<br /><br />Track 12: Under My Umbrella--(8)--a harder guitar-soaked song about non-conformity and remaining true to one's own opinions, no matter how much peer pressure is exuded.  Boyd shuts his eyes to your suggestions and remains true to himself.<br /><br />Track 13: Aqueous Transmission--(10)--a crowd favorite, this is the most mellow track on the album and was even described by Boyd as the track that he wanted to be so relaxing, the listener would \\"pee in his/her own pants\\" from the relief.  A beautiful piece over 8 minutes long in which you can easily envision yourself floating down a river on a raft, eyes closed, peaceful waters and oriental instruments playing from somewhere beyond the reeds.  The ending of the song even features frogs croaking from outside the house where they recorded the album.  An excellent piece to sign off with and an easy cult favorite.time out now to appreciate yourselfm, you'll miss your opportunity.

B001TWT0A4|4.0|This is one of those movies that has the old fashioned western feel from the beginning and all the characters do a terrific job of enhancing that sensation. Wayne and Mitchum are both on their game and play off each other like the pros they were. Since the plot is pretty simple, the characters get to show their stuff regularly throughout the movie. All parts of the movie provide fun and the old belief that the good guy should win and get the pretty girl. When you are through watching you have the feeling that the actors had as much fun making the movie as you had in watching it.

B00005K3NR|4.0|Carrie (Speical Edition)    The movie is considered a classic. I enjoyed it but I wouldn't call it one of my all-time favorite horror movies. I did notice a few problems with the speical edition dvd, I dont know if other people have the same problem with this dvd    When the woman tells the gym teacher to shove it up her...and that's it. This is the first time viewing the film and do not know if it's like that in the original version or this is a screw up. I think it is because the gym teacher got really mad hahahaha.     When the three guys are picking out tuxedo's, it quickly goes into Alvin and The Chipmunk mode for a brief few seconds. That has to be a dvd error and not apart of the original film.    That's the two problems I had with the movie but other then that, it was enjoyable.

B00004U28G|5.0|This is a DVD in very good condition and the original case. It was shipped and received in a very short time. I was quite satisfied with the transaction and would buy from this seller again without a second thought.

I think our idea of what is a quality production has been lowered, because we watch so much junk daily... so many people will rate this pretty high. If your standards are Gods and Generals your going to be pretty unhappy you paid [...] for the DVD. If your standard is the common TV level movie (Lifetime or Oxygen network) you might actually like it. For me ... go to Gettysburg.  Live history whenever you get a chance.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|I have seen both Gladiator and Braveheart on blu-ray as of street date Sep 2. I watched Braveheart first and was pleased with the natural film like quality of the transfer and the amazing level of detail, kudos on Braveheart! Gladiator, on the other hand, was a disappointment in all areas. When the level of detail is taken to this extreme with DNR and EE it results in a very artificial and harsh picture. This is the case with Gladiator. So extreme is the \\"scrubbing\\" of this film that actual parts of the movie are missing, as reported. This is unacceptable. Any QC could have easily spotted this before production. To make matters worse, this is part of their \\"Sapphire series\\" which apparently means...we dont care, just give us your money you idiots. Not me...not a chance. Not until this is is re-issued and confirmed. Shame on you Universal and Paramount.
B001HN697M|5.0|i knew that this movie was a prequel before i saw it becuase i am a fan of the underworld trilogy. anyone else however may not know these things. i suggest watching underworld before watching this movie, the 2nd movie barely contributes but it is a good watch as well.

B001ECQ6PG|5.0|I was wondering how I'd convert the old albums I have to digital and thought I'd give this product a try. With the software provided and ease of use, this product does it all. My first try was to convert an old Hopalong Cassidy story album I've had since 1952. In no time I had it on the PC and then I tried removing the noises that come with old age (the recording not me), the revised sound now is like new.    I will now start on all of my albums and convert them to MP3's. This product is a MUST for those that want to convert your albums and tapes to MP3's.

B001OQCV9M|4.0|\\"Julie and Julia\\" is a wonderful \\"apr&egrave;s diner\\" tribute to the woman who brought French cooking (and decent food in general) to the American dinner table. Julie Powell is a not-quite-successful 30-year-old writer in NYC hoping to find her stride by blogging through all of Julia Childs' \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in a year. The movie switches backs and forth between Julie's gustatorial struggles and the story of the real Julia Child as she toiled in pre-feminist 1950s France to find her own place in the world. Meryl Streep does a loopy, slightly over-the-top rendition of Julia that is charming, funny and loving. But Stanley Tucci, who played Julia's devoted diplomat husband Paul, really stole the show with his charm, reserve, self-effacement and undying devotion to his brilliant wife. Topically, the film  manages a few comments at the difficulty of supporting victims of 9/11 as well as to the witch-hunting McCarthy days, in which a love of European culture was enough to make one suspicious in the eyes of uber-patriotic American officials.<br /><br />\\"Julie and Julia\\" is not too serious, and often hilarious, but tastes great and goes down easily. C'est magnifique!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is such a great movie....frightening that this might be our fate in a decade or two! The DVD didn't work on my player all the way through, but neither did the one I borrowed from my son. I assume it's my player, not the DVD, but I sure would like to know why it gets stuck in the very same place on both DVDs!! I'll have to do some investigating.

Will re-read in another month, and probably another month after that.
B000KX0IOK|3.0|After viewing Lars and the Real Girl, I was so blown away by Ryan Gosling as an actor, I had to pick up another film of his.  Half Nelson delivers another stunning performance by Gosling, but the film as a whole doesn't quite live up to Gosling's abilities.  No real plot drives the movie, which does provide an interesting character study, but the film does not give the audience enough connection with the characters to keep their attention.  It reaches in too many directions, from Dan's addiction to his relationship with various women, to Drey's family life, to her relationship with Frank, to the classroom scenes, that it felt like there was no time to really connect to any of these directions.  Too many snapshots tend to blur the overall picture.<br /><br />The first half of the movie I was so bored with the way it dragged and blurry, unfocused shots with maudlin music to accompany, I contemplated shutting it off.  The performances of Shareeka Epps and Gosling were so extraordinary though, they kept me from giving up on this film.  I am glad I persevered, because the film picked up steam and asked some interesting questions near the end.  The drug-dealer Frank stood out to me as we approached the end as the most complex character, because he seemed to be the only one fleshed out enough to see the complexities of his personality and situation.<br /><br />The plot of a brilliant, white teacher who teaches at a predominately black inner-city high school immediately conjures up stereotypes from films such as Dangerous Minds or The Principal, and I worried when Half Nelson might plunge into such stereotypes as well.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover a richer movie than that, and by the end of the film, I had to applaud the film for not trying to wrap the film up with some overall moral or teaching.  I still cannot decide if it completely outweighs the very, very, very slow build-up, but a movie that improves is better than a movie that does not.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this film for anyone with the patience to wait it out.  If you're looking for a moderate or fast paced, plot-driven film though, this may not be the movie for you.his film for anyone with the patience to wait it out.

B002KAOSEW|1.0|I wish that he would leave his politics out of his books.  It's a good story until he takes a hard left turn and ended up leaving me wondering how a good author could go so wrong.  Don't waste your time on this.  I would suggest something from Harlan Coben, his books are wittier and more satisfying.
B00275EGTC|4.0|bottom line:<br /><br />-you have to know what you are getting into before seeing it. If you are watching it and floating away to the kitchen or pausing it to answer the phone, then its a movie that is more geared to a certain portion of moviegoers who only can motivate a certain part of their lobes. The ones that will appreciate a film such as this one, know who they are, are prone to films that inspire us to 'make it happen.'<br /><br />-it's a surreal attempt at showing *that* pinnacle solo acting can carry a film, to so touch our concepts of visual orgasm, that indeed a work of pure genius is created.<br /><br />-Duncan Jones, Bowie's son, seems like the guy next door, that vagabond filmmaker, still humping that American Dream, completely attached to the process of following your heart, he seems like one cool motha to be friends with. I look forward to his career with open arms.<br /><br />-Clint Mansell's score is the kind of music you can have in the background at a party and everyone will say, 'man who is this!!!!' Electrifying, maybe the best word is 'fitting', astounding, takes you to the cosmos, makes you feel invincible.<br /><br />Again, if you can't think, open your mind, and have no conceptual understanding of the particulars of a film, as opposed to blanket generalities, and can think outside the box, perhaps then you too, can see why this is a shining example of originality and creativeness still left in miserable Hollywood.
0307474275|1.0|This is a poorly written piece of pulp. There are much better books on this subject out there. Holy Blood, Holy Grail for one.

B00109T5WY|5.0|Many post-rock aficionados attempt to confine the genre by creating over-specified criteria and remaining staunch in opinion - however, there are no defining attributes to \\"the perfect post-rock band\\". Some artists are atmospheric and focus on noise and ambience, while others are more in-your-face and focus on hard rock. Some are minimalistic while others are busy and technical. There is no right or wrong - it's all subject to personal opinion.     That being said, This Will Destroy You's self-titled album encompasses all attributes. Every track, aside from \\"Villa del Refugio\\" (which is pure background ambience), has moments of simple, quiet ambience that slowly swell into themes both monumental and triumphant.     I completely disagree with one particular reviewer: if you are warming up to the post-rock genre, This Will Destroy You is the very first album you should purchase - their Young Mountain EP being the second. Neither album requires an \\"acquired taste\\". Both albums are welcoming to new listeners, and will stay in your car's cd player for weeks before the thought of changing the disk enters your mind.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I normally rate a book simply whether I sit down to read it because I am sitting in the car waiting to pick up one of my kids or because I have taken time out of my day to read because I want to know what is going to happen next.  I give this 4 stars because it was enjoyable and I cared about the characters ad what happened next in the story.  I did think it was pretty similar to both Harry Potter and Twilight. That is not necessarily a bad thing..... I enjoyed both of them as well. This just did not seem as fresh and original.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|It never occurred to me to write a review here b/c I purchased this product at a brick and mortar BBB (with a 20% coupon).<br /><br />I friggin LOOOOOOOOVE this thing!  I originally saw the infomercial so I immediately thought it couldn't be that great.  But when I saw it at my local BBB about a year ago, I bought it knowing that I could return it if it was crap.<br /><br />First and foremost, this is NOT my primary vacuum.  Instead, I use it to pick up debris brought in by shoes or our 2 dogs.  We have all tile flooring on the first floor of our home so I figured it'd be handy to pick up things that I didn't want to bring out the Dyson for.<br /><br />Here are the features that I like:<br /><br />*It's super light.  I can easily pick it up and move it around.  It glides easily on tile and on my rugs.<br />*The dirt holding chamber is great b/c you get to see exactly what you picked up!<br />*((this is the part I was really surprised by))  It picks up smaller threads, pet hair, debris from my rugs that my Dyson left behind.  Because I can't use the \\"carpet\\" feature on my Dyson while vacuuming my rugs (it makes that horrid noise) -- it just glides over some debris and does not pick it up.  But when I use the swivel sweeper on the rug, it completely picks up tons of stuff, including woven in pet hair.  LOVE IT!<br /><br />Now onto the criticisms:<br />*It's very loud.  You don't ever hear the noise on the infomercial.  This doesn't really bother me and it's not loud enough to bother my dogs but my husband commented that they don't tell you how loud it is.<br />*If you accidentally roll it over carpet and it tips over, your sweeped up contents can fall out.  Not a huge deal until you get the hang of it.<br />*minor complaint -- I wish the battery had a low level indicator.  Instead, I just leave it in the swivel sweeper and since I don't use it as my primary vacuum, it's not really a problem.  I don't run out of charge for several weeks or at least a month.  I leave the battery in until it absolutely runs out.  Then I charge for at least 24 hours before using again. This sounds like I put alot of effort into it, but it just sounds like more work than it really is.<br /><br />Overall, I like to use it for a little bits that fall onto the kitchen floor or debris brought in by the dogs.<br />It also worked great during last Christmas to pick up falling tree needles!<br /><br />I liked it enough to buy it for friends and family mostly because it's so light and convenient to use for those little jobs when you don't want to drag out the big vacuum!for at least 24 hours before using again.

B000669GAI|5.0|There's not a single \\"best of\\" album out there that contains everybody's favorites. Music is a subjective art. But this selection of songs by Pearl Jam is pretty close.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|I agree with the other recent reviews, the Blu-ray version of this is a travesty.  The EE + DNR persistent throughout makes it almost unwatchable.  The only good parts are the extended sequences, but they only last for a fraction of the movie's running time.  Avoid at all costs!
B00139ZKC0|4.0|Whitney's mega-selling debut from 1985 gets a Japanese reissue (it's one of 5 including her first 4 studio albums and 'The Bodyguard' soundtrack). As usual with Japanese releases it's beautifully packaged, in this case featuring miniture LP artwork. But the problem is this: it's not been remastered at all and sounds as soft as the domestic version which is much, much cheaper.<br /><br />I have to say this is an increasing trend with Japanese CDs. They used to be known for their superior quality but now it seems they just re-release any old album, don't bother to remaster it but stick it in a 'paper sleeve' to get the completists money.<br /><br />None of Whitney's albums sound bad but her first album is the one that needs an overhaul soundwise. Perhaps with the release of 'I Look To You' her back catalogue will get a decent reissue.<br /><br />So, unless you're into LP artwork and are a Whitney completist with money to burn, I'd recommend you give this version a miss. I haven't heard the other 4 albums in the series but it's probably safe to assume they won't have been remastered either...<br /><br />I have to say I'm disappointed in this reissue. 'Whitney Houston'is an excellent album and deserves better than this.
B00005QHV5|5.0|I just heard on my classical station the Fifth played from this recording. I dont know if it was from this remastered box set or from the earlier single CD with the Fourth and Fifth.  But either way, the performance was terrific !! If the rest of the symphonies on this set are as good as the Fifth then, yes, this definitely is one of the best Beethoven symphony cycles out there.
B000M0XJ88|5.0|I've only owned this watch for a couple of weeks now, but I really like it.  I heard that automatic watches can gain/loss time, and this one is no different.  I've been monitoring this to see just how much change there is.  Mine has gained about one minute a week...  I think that's a microscopic inconvenience for a sub $100 watch that you'll never have to put a battery in.  I owned a Swiss Army chronograph before this and it was far bulkier and required a new battery about once a year.  At the very least, you'll have to set the date every other month (on average) anyway, so that would be a good time to sync the time.  The face is very easy the read.  Having the hours and minutes marked on the face makes it a breeze to read the exact time.  The strap is not the greatest, but I like the metal loops.  I've owned many watches with \\"buckle type\\" straps, and I've had all of them loss the loops long before the strap was worn out.  All-in-all this is a great watch for a great price.  I look forward to not having to pay for batteries or straps for many years to come! ;)
B00127RAJY|5.0|Using this video to get in shape after the birth of my son.  Love the circuits in this workout...great for short attention spans.  The workouts are more like 24-26 minutes long beginning to end, but they're great.  This is the longest I've ever stuck with a workout video and I actually look forward to doing it.  I saw and felt improvements in a week.  I need to add a couple more stretches during the cool down, but otherwise it's great!
B002LBU7BS|2.0|The soundtrack includes the song Violet from Hole's album Live Through This. After looking at this album, there is a song called Jennifer's Body.  Why was this song excluded from the soundtrack?  The song complements the movie very well. Otherwise, this soundtrack is just ok.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Gladiator is directed by Ridley Scott, and his exquisite use of shadow and tone are showcased in this film. This story is set in the time of Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), and his successor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Russell Crowe portrays a gladiator, Maximus Meridas, who comes back to reap his revenge on Commodus after being forced into slavery. Connie Nielson, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed also star in this film. What makes this movie so good, besides the great cinematography, are the strong characters. This film is as much about the choices people make in life and how this affects their lives, as the ebbs and flows of our existence.<br /><br />This blu-ray disc was filmed with 5.1 dts master audio and in 1080p. There is some evidence of DNR(digital noise reduction) and EE(edge enhancement), but nothing so much that it spoiled my viewing of the film. The film is mostly crisp and clear. This disc also has lots of extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with scholars about history, and commentary from Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, but best of all is the inclusion of an extended cut which has sixteen extra minutes of deleted scenes. Those that enjoy this film may also want to check out HBO's \\"Rome\\" series which is a gritty depiction of Roman history around the time of Julius Caesar, and Antony and Cleopatra.

B001AQTWF2|1.0|I really had hope for Ms. Houston after cleaning up after all the years of her drug abuse and dumping that loser. She looks beautiful and I was hoping that this album was going to save her career. Then I previewed the CD on Amazon and I was like \\"What is this?\\" But I decided to give it another chance and figured it would sound different if I downloaded it. I was still not happy with it, only liking 2 songs. After seeing the performance on The Today show it confirmed that her voice is gone. Unfortunately I think its over with this Diva....
0440238609|4.0|My thoughts on this trilogy, correct me if I'm wrong. as said on other posts, the writing is well done. However I have some issues with the plot.To me there isn't much closure in the end. During the whole series it is told that Lyra had some important decision to make as Eve, and would be tempted by Mary Malone. This was going to effect the worlds enough that the Magesterium was sending out people to kill the both of them. I thought she would be some major factor in the war in the end or something, find some way to save all the worlds. However, I never saw that happen. DR. Malone didn't tempt Lyra with anything, and Lyra didn't make some huge decision to save the worlds. Unless I'm missing something. Lyra and Bill did fall in love in the end, but that is normal.it's not a conscious decision. And how that changed the flow of the dust, I don't know. Was going into the world of the dead that decision? If so, it had nothing to do with Malone, it was Lyra wanting to keep a promise to a friend. So if I am missing something explained in the book, please tell me.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|WHITNEY CD IS AWESOME. SHE'S BACK WITH THE VOICE THAT WE ALL WAITED SO LONG TO HERE. THE TITLES ON THE CD ARE SUPER GREAT.SHE MADE A GREAT RECOVERY.I MYSELF LUV THE TRACKS 1 3 5  THE MOST  BUT OVER ALL ITS AWESOME CD.
B000002KB8|5.0|I bought this in '72 when I was 12 years old.  It blew my mind and I was hooked.  Bought it again on vinyl and then on CD.  I wound up with a little Black Sabbath collection, but my favorite by far is this album.  Here I am pushing 50 years old and still have to play this cd at least a couple times a year.  I don't even listen much to hard rock or heavy metal any more, but this masterpiece I always come back to.  To me it's also one of the most under-rated albums.  And I have to disagree with the editor's review.  I grown tired of Paranoid before the 70's ended and found it less sophisticated musically than this album.  Paranoid never really had the magic in it that this first Black Sabbath album had.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Oh my god! I love love love this thing!!! It is so0o0o easy to use! I have a lil toddler who likes to throw food, and this thing picks up everything! Even broken glass, mushy veges, etc. It's easy to charge, no plug ins or whatever, just pop the battery into the outlet, and let charge! I love it!!! Oh my gosh I recommend this to everyone, my home is so much cleaner with this thing because it takes 30 seconds what a broom would take at least, at least 5 minutes. It is a great invension. Just be sure to clean out the hairs and stuff evry so often (i use sissors, which is easier and faster than the tool they gave).  It relieved a lot of stress as well as messes in my home. I love it!!
0451528018|5.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles deserves its recognition for a number of reasons. Not only was it the first Sherlock Holmes story to be released in the 20th Century but it was the first story that seemingly endeavoured into the world of the supernatural which would challenge Holmes' idea of rational existence. This story has also spawned many film adaptations but none of which match up to the spectacular story telling ability of Conan Doyle and the gripping nature of the plot told in its literary form. This has become my favourite of the Holmes novels simply for the way in which the case being explored is introduced and the twists which allow it to reach its conclusion.<br /><br />The plot focuses around the death of Sir Charles Baskerville in the county of Devon. His heir, Sir Henry Baskerville is forced to travel from Canada to claim his fortune but first he is introduced to Holmes & Watson by Sir Charles' friend Dr. Mortimer. Dr. Mortimer is convinced the death of Sir Charles was caused by the legendary Baskervilles curse which has been killing the Baskerville heirs for centuries. The myth focuses around Sir Hugo Baskerville who lived during the time of Oliver Cromwell. The curse arose through revenge of Sir Hugo's misdeeds and has haunted the family ever since. The body of Sir Charles is found with no visible wounds so it is determined that Sir Charles died of pure fright and an obscure footprint of some form of hound a distance from the body only seeks to enforce the myth of the demonic beast.<br /><br />Told in the third person once again from the perspective of Dr. Watson the story gives a whole new importance to Holmes' accomplice as Watson is sent off to Devon as the protector for the heir to Sir Charles' fortune and fellow investigator whilst Holmes stays in London to commit to another crime. This time spent away from the Holmes character gave me a broader appreciation for the importance of Watson and it certainly does appear, from reading previous stories, the Watsons skills of observation have improved thanks to the time spent with his companion in solving crime. Two chapters specifically are written in the context of letters to Holmes and again gave diversity to the writing of Conan Doyle which makes the situations all the more realistic.<br /><br />The setting of Dartmoor and the descriptions of the Baskerville Manor are detailed and easy to imagine in their own right. The imagery of the Grimpen Mire is especially intriguing and the inspiration for the Grimpen Mire is certainly a place I would like to see. The characters aside from the main protagonists are interesting in their own quirks and presence and their importance or lack thereof still add equally to that of the overall story. The legend of the hound itself is an excellent way of challenging Holmes' overall mentality as he first dismisses the myth as nonsense but as more and more evidence piles up in support of the myth it becomes interesting to see the character come to terms that some form of demonic hound may actually exist. It is a stunning story and a worthy addition to the Holmes universe.ills of observation have improved thanks to the time spent with his companion in solving crime.

B000FS9FCG|1.0|If you want to be propagandized for two hours by a pathetically juvenile attempt at glamorizing the extreme left, then go right ahead and watch this dreary and slow moving advertisement for radical leftism. This pathetic storyline does its best to rehash every single stale bit of canard and rhetoric right out of the old socialist democrat playbook of the United States in an obvious attempt to smear; President Bush and his administration, Rush Limbaugh, the military, etcetera.. This movie was an insult to the intelligence of any person who has even a feeble grasp of history, human nature and politics. The blatantly political attack on conservatism falls flat as the writers (propagandists) try to portray the NAZI like government of England as being conservative, anyone who knows their history knows that the NAZI party was entirely socialist, and that all the repressive regimes throughout history have all been socialist/communist dictatorships. My advice is to try reading a history book rather than watching this drivel, you might just learn something.
B000NU2CY4|2.0|I don't think I've written a review on Amazon yet for as much as I've shopped here, but I felt compelled to review this Blu-Ray release.  Gladiator is one of my favorite movies and I was quite excited about this release.  To much dismay, most of the movie visually feels like I am watching an upscaled DVD.  There are some moments that shine, but the difference between the great quality of the extended scenes and the processing that plagues the theatrical scenes are very noticeable that it has really made me question why the whole movie couldn't be transferred with the superb visuals displayed in the extended scenes.    Overall, the movie is still great with a nice bundle of extras included, but I am still very disappointed with the video quality of the theatrical footage which is what I was mostly looking forward to with this purchase.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|Not my type of music. I don't like her singing style. I'm just very disappointed. I was hoping for something more moving, touching, more feeling, more vocal power... There's nothing there. That's it.
0439023491|5.0|I stayed up all night to finish, couldn't put it down. The only negative I have to say is that it's a trilogy, and I have to wait for the next book now!
B002DZX94Y|5.0|I complained DGG printing quality with Collection 1 - now I am very satisfied with photo quality of Collection 2. In leaflet there are quite interesting photos: starting with fine pct with young Abbado, with Rubinstein etc. It seems to me that there are not new remasterings in the set, for me old ones are just fine. Mini LP covers are nice: there are two first-time CD covers: Schumann/Chopin with Rostropovich and orginal LP cover for Dutoit/Tchaikovsky concerto. It is a bluish photo of flying pigeons and the only cover in the set without Martha's face. The orginal CD had a nice color photo ([[ASIN:B000001G5P Tschaikowsky and Prokofiev:Klavierkonzerte]]) which is not listed in leaflet but I guess it is familiar to all her fans.<br /><br />I think Martha's numerous fans know most recordings of the set, they have been very nicely available and well-known. However, I like to recommend Mendelssohn Double Concerto with Kremer, which is very entertaining work and given quaranteed Argerichian touch. It is very enjoyable concerto, full of fire and poetry. I usually do not listen Mendelssohn much but this is really worth hearing and warmly recommended.<br /><br />In the set there are 2 versions of Ravel G, Tchaikovsky and Beethoven 2nd concerto. Of course it is nice thing, but it would had been better to add some concertos to her repertoire, say Prokofiev 2 or 5, perhaps... The fact remains that with Emi recordings we have also other versions...more Chopin, Shostakovich, Haydn and once more Beet 2! I am not complaining, because I like this concerto very much and version with Sinopoli is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Summary: 5 stars - great concerto recordings - in beautiful box - warmly recommended! Hopefully we will have possibility to enjoy her Chamber music treasures with Collection 3 soon!

B001MRMRS8|3.0|The three stars are strictly for the singing, zero stars for the staging.      Features a giant clock, androgynous party guests with identical cardboard masks, a stubble-faced transvestite with a long tongue wearing a bright red dress (a duplicate of Violetta's, which is no doubt intended to make some profound point or other), Alfredo violently stuffing money into Violetta's bodice, gratuitous dark \\"angels\\" standing about in serried ranks, and a dark, mysterious figure who turns into Dr. Grenville in the last act.     In other words, it's a total mess that bears some resemblance to Verdi's opera, but has much more to do with Willy Decker's ego (which, come to think of it, a good working definition of Regietheater).  It's a great example of what's become popularly known as \\"Eurotrash\\" opera.    I am no rabid hater of alternative stagings, and I would have been fine with it if it somehow made the story more comprehensible -- but it really doesn't.  Instead, it seems more like Decker is poking fun at Piave's (and, by inference Dumas') story and trying to impress us with how smart he is (and, of course, with how dumb all of us are should we not \\"get it\\").    All that being said, the quality of the singing is admirable -- especially given the conditions under which Netrebko, Villazon et. al. had to work.    It's probably worth purchasing to listen to the singing; but is, alas, at its best with the TV off.

B002M5ZCEU|2.0|I was praying Whitney would get voice coaching, medical treatment for any damages and be put through all the steps necessary for her come back.  I believe she will make money from this album which I'm sure she needs after all those Bobby years.  But she has lost her voice. I pray she will make enough money to have peach for the rest of her life.  She gave us some of the most beautiful vocals ever and no one will ever top her.  But she is pitiful now.  Can you imagine what the song \\"I look to you\\" would sound like by the old Whitney.    God Bless Her Always
159562015X|3.0|I loved the Book Strength Finders by Rath, however, I bought it used.  I was very unhappy with the Seller.  He did not make it clear that the assessment code was not available.  Frankly without the assessment, the book is of limited utility.  My message is simply this:    DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK USED, or contact the seller first to make sure the assessment code is still available.      Furthermore, I would not recommend the book seller.  He did do a good job with the packaging, or promotion of this book

Thanks, Amazon!    Jennifer
B001AQTWF2|2.0|Much like everyone, I was excited when I heard that she was coming back, as far back as 2006. I love me some Whitney and I even thought her 2001/2 release was pretty decent despite the \\"weight loss\\". I heard some leaked stuff and wasn't really inspired but then when I heard at the listening party that they were underproduced, unfinished works, that changed my mind. From a vocal stand point, she's here but it's not a big deal like it was in 1998. I heard a 2004 performance she did at a Woman's World Music Award Ceremony and I got excited , but as I think about it, that video could've been earlier than that. Anyway with that said, I brought a legitimate copy of the CD despite some raised eyebrows from some facebook friends; some thought I should get it other ways and I did say previously that I wasn't too impressed with what I heard from the leaked tracks.   So I put it in and this is what I heard:    1. Million Dollar Bill - A nice little opener for a CD, not Whitney's Cd though. The long run at the beginning of the CD from her was a nice start and the song is cute, if you're trying to go backwards. When I previous got the news about the song that Alicia Keys wrote it; I was excited, keyword being was. I'm very familiar with Alicia Keys' work and she's a really soulful artist with sporadic inconsistent work through her catalogue but she can punch when she's into it. So i heard the song all the way through on the album and I thought, eh it's annoying afterwhile but it's got a nice groove to it. about a 4 for me.     from tracks 2-4, I wandered off and it pretty much ran together, I almost forgot who I was listening to.     5. Like I Never Left - heard it previously, the album version isn't different than what leaked 2 years ago so another uninspired moment.     6. A Song For You - Where do I start. *shudders*, okay got that out of my system. I am a big fan of Donny Hathaway, the most soulful singer, that man gives me chills from the very first note. So when I saw thissong as part of the tracklisting last month, I was a bit apprehensive for a couple reasons. For one, its Donny Hathaway who takes this song to so many places LIVE!, you have to have the voice to carry anywhere near that level. Whitney hasn't had a \\"voice\\" near that level in a long time and in any of the releases prior to this album (i.e. Family First). So I listened to this song and I was looking for that soul, that yearning and that vulnerability needed for this song and neither she nor the music showed that. For one thing that made it a dance song, changing the rhythm to an upbeat which is enough to hurl this record across Baltimore City. I don't remember anything after this song on the album.     7. I didn't Know My Own Strength - Hmmmm, I saw that Dianne Warren wrote this song and this is supposed to be the defining moment of the album, to me at least because a.) Dianne Warren songs are the IT songs (i.e. I Learned From the Best). I knew my own strength, to move to the next song and it pretty much went down hill after that.     8-11 Throwaway.     Overall, the album is like Aretha Franklin singing Shanice songs or Mariah Carey singing well Mariah Carey songs (99 and later). It neither moved me and her voice didn't wow me like it should, the album should've been called \\"The Sabbatical\\" because that's what it feels like. It's nice to see that she came back but this isn't worth 3 years and it's a shame that Beyonce can write, produce an excellent album in less than two weeks and Whitney took 3 years to produce this eh throwaway. This would be at the bottom of the list, right behind \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\". This is another miss but not an actual waste of money because it is \\"The voICE\\".
B001AQTWF2|4.0|The word \\"comeback\\" is so unfair to the artist.  It implies that he or she has been \\"dead\\" and has somehow been miraculously \\"resurrected.\\" The reasons for an artist's \\"hiatus\\" can be as varied as personal problems to searching for a better career move, or in the case of a singer, finding just the right songs to record.<br /><br />With Whitney's personal life being the stuff of public knowledge, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why it has taken so long for her to release something new; and that \\"new\\" is a mixture of the \\"now\\" and the \\"then.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Love for You\\" tries to satisfy both the singer's more mature fan base and the younger hip-hop generation...to mixed results.  Though six of the songs hint to past \\"triumphs\\", four are average, at best.  There's not a five-star song in the lot.<br /><br />While the sound and the lyrics are very contemporary, Whitney's voice, just \\"ain't what it used to be.\\"<br /><br />The latter is the most sobering aspect of listening to this album.  It's like watching the prize fighter whose glory days are behind him, ready to have throw that one last great KO.<br /><br />Mind you, Whitney is not ready to \\"throw in the towel\\" quite yet.  She's got some good \\"fights\\" ahead of her.<br /><br />It's just we, the fans, who have to face the fact that she's older, a little \\"slower\\" and though she can \\"go the distance,\\" she has to win by a TKO.<br /><br />And that decision will be based on us, the fans.<br /><br />Song by song rating:<br /><br />\\"Million Dollar Bill\\" -3 stars<br />\\"Nothin' But Love\\" - 4 stars<br />\\"Call You Tonight\\" - 4 stars<br />\\"I Look to You\\" - 3 stars<br />\\"Like I Never Left\\" - 4 stars<br />\\"A Song for You\\" - 4 stars<br />\\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" - 4 stars<br />\\"Worth It\\" - 4 stars<br />\\"For the Lovers\\" - 4 stars<br />\\"I Got You\\" - 3 stars<br />\\"Salute\\" - 3 stars
B000002H5I|5.0|I loved \\"Fast Car\\" when it came out, and bought this album on vinyl. I listened to it until the grooves wore out! Hearing this CD was like stepping back to 1988, when I had a fast car, and was ready to go anywhere. What a voice. And such real lyrics. She told stories that made you feel like she was in your life at that moment, and that by hearing it through music, you could change your circumstances. Love this CD. Love Chapman!

0061438294|4.0|This is a very well-written, entertaining, and easy-to-digest book that delivers exactly what it promises.  The organization is well thought out and effective.  The reason that I give the book four stars instead of five is that I think that it could be easily improved with the addition of short chapter summaries, e.g. bulleted lists of the points made within the chapter.    Note that the author repeatedly makes a point of reminding you that using body language to identify liars outright is extremely difficult.  Instead, you use it to identify subjects/questions which cause discomfort in the person you are talking with, thereby identifying the areas that you need to explore further.    His observations on the innate \\"freeze/flight/fight\\" response of humans are fascinating.  He puts into words things that you already sorta \\"know\\" subliminally but have never really thought about directly.  I found myself able to recall having seen (and done myself) every single behavior he describes, and now I know directly what they mean & what to look for.  He includes lots of personal anecdotes, too, which enliven the material.    Since finishing the book, I've found how readily this information can be put to use.  Once I knew what to look for, I just automatically started looking.  Curiously, I find myself decoding my own body language as often as that of others!  It's amazing how accurate his interpretations of my own body language have been.  For me, that has reinforced my perception that he knows what he's talking about.  After all, you know exactly how you're feeling when you catch yourself performing some specific gesture or action, so if your feelings match your body language, well voila!  Navarro just read your mind.

0307269981|4.0|I enjoyed this book and the previous Steig Larsson book The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  I look forward to the third book continuing the  stories from these two books.
055358894X|3.0|It was very dull and the flash backs seemed to get in the way of the story.
0385512058|5.0|This one deserves 5 stars for it's ability to communicate a seemingly simple idea about working with others. I learned a lot from Ferrazzi's account of his success.<br /><br />First, I genuinely love the idea the pie getting bigger. So few people look at the world this way as it is truly an evolved state of human affairs to see the success of others a your own success and see that sharing and caring, when genuine make for a full fun life.<br /><br />I wish I was brave enough to do half the things in this book! He spends a fairly quick chapter on how to think about getting over the fear of speaking to others. I think there could be volumes more, but since the thrust of his book is not this manner, he sites, probably one of the foremost experts on the topic, Dale Carnegie (How to make friends and influence people).<br /><br />What he adds to the discourse is similar to the book \\"THE SECRET\\". Know what you want, and pursue it. Realize that you are not alone and that if give to the world and look around you and not just at your goal you can make small victories that collectively add to large ones.<br /><br />I think it's fantastic that he speaks about his own errors, misdeeds, and embarrassments. When we look at the successful, it's often hard to realize that they probably had more than 1 set back. The difference is in how they handled adversity.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed his discussions on how he came to know his \\"calling\\" and what he wanted out of life. It makes you really want to do some soul searching away from all the complex notions of what you should want and go for it.<br /><br />5 stars go to both great articulation and some decent tools with which to move forward.
B00160ZDKA|5.0|I'm listening to this CD now and I have to say it still holds well after so many listens over the years. The recording is also of excellent quality which used to be the hallmark of DG (though sadly in recent years no longer so.) If you're looking for a well recorded, well played recording of these two concertos, you can't be far wrong with selecting this disc.
B00243FQFA|5.0|I am upset this was the last season for this show, but I think it was a very good run.
0143038419|5.0|Usually I don't read bestsellers but I decided to purchase this book after I saw Gilbert's talk about genius on [...] and absolutely loved her ideas!!!  I am very glad that I didn't read all the bad reviews about the book that could've discouraged me to buy it.<br />  This book is inspiring and very entertaining.  It's easy to read and always puts a smile on my face (sometimes a hysterical laugh).<br />  Yes, some may say it's narcissistic and selfish but I believe it's a very honest and intricate exploration of self.  Everyone should take time and focus on their own happiness once in a while.  It is not called self indulging, but it is self improvement and self awareness.<br /> I just love Gilbert's honesty about her feelings and desires that anyone could definitely relate to.  I love her courage! I love her fearless passion for traveling!  I love that she worked for GQ! I love that she has guts to disagree with the views of society and start a quest for her own happiness.  I've found great wisdoms in this book!!!<br /> Great book for anyone!!! It's like going on a great adventure!
B00204AA0O|4.0|There was a Soviet songwriter pounding on her piano, singing simple storylines with a wisdom and sincerity not typically seen in women her age. That time is now, that place is NYC, and that songwriter is Regina Spektor.  Having stumbled onto Regina a couple years ago with her popular \\"Fidelity\\" track from the 2006 album, \\"Begin to Hope,\\" I saw in her a similarity to another favorite artist of mine, Tori Amos.  Besides both being quirky female vocalists with a penchant for the piano, Regina shared Tori's spectacular vocal strength to change intense, emotional inflection mid-momentum.  Creative shifts in tempo, clever line breaks (that you'll probably find as tweets), and a way of making listeners close their eyes to reflect (i.e. consider and chew the music, not just swallow bubble gum), the two offer what we listeners often seek: a fresh new way to see the world, as well as a way to see ourselves in it.    As a casually adoring fan of both, I find Regina's voice to be a bit sweeter and more positive.  Perhaps it's her comparable youth and/or lack of jadedness that Tori sustained after her rape (which she heavily details in \\"Me and a Gun\\" in 1992's \\"Little Earthquakes\\") or miscarriage (1994's \\"Bells for Her\\"/Under the Pink), both personal tragedies she made public through her music. Not to say that Regina lacks depth or harsh life experiences, she sings soulfully, but the darkness isn't there and she isn't reaching into our souls. She's still telling stories about love, loyalty and legacy. She reveals her world to us in cheerful, upbeat daydreams of empty beaches and stories of missing wallets. Everything, it seems, is a joyous reason to sing. (And isn't it?)      The track title, \\"One More Time with Feeling\\" could be the subtitle to, \\"Far.\\" As if a volume 2, Regina's style is consistent to 2006's Hope's, with plain, descriptive language and powerfully insightful inductions.  Regina has a special talent of making every day, unassuming observations profound, as with \\"Eet\\"'s frustrating struggle to remember your favorite song, or  \\"Laughing with,\\" as in, \\"No one laughs at God when the last thing they see is a pair of hateful eyes.... but God can be funny at a cocktail party\\". If you catch yourself thinking about that the next time you read a horrific story in the Crime section of the news, you realize how influential her words and thoughts are.  That's the power this twenty-nine year old woman's music will have on you--you'll be thinking about it long after listening. If you like your music with cunning lyrics, surprising shifts, and a thick emotional sound--Regina's \\"Far\\" can take you as far (to space, looking at a blue, blue planet) or as near (in your living room, looking at found receipt for leather boots) as you want to go.  Just don't expect her to take you farther than she's been.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|this is hands down a great show!! simply my favorite. i recommend it to anyone old enough to watch it!
0375413405|5.0|I went to see the movie, so I figured I had to get the book and it's really interesting- both the story and the food. Some of the philosophy reminds me of that cute Pixar movie Ratatouille- \\"anyone can cook\\" in th eFrench style of haute cuisine. That's what Child professed and that's what she's showing in her book \\"Mastering the Art of French COoking\\".    Most of the recipes fit into the [[ASIN:0375710515 French Women Don't Get Fat]] diet rather than my favorite [[ASIN:1600200478 The Evolution Diet: All-Natural and Allergy Free]], but there are still some valuable bits. The vegetable sides are really marvelous and the Charcuterie section has some delectible entrees that would fit well in the natural diet.     Overall, it's a foodie's must! Buy this and enjoy a year's full of recipes in the French style with the ease of American practicality.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I am listening to this epic live performance the third time through without a halt! At 60+ this performance is one of Clapton's finest pieces of work. This man and his guitar have matured like a fine wine. I don't think I have ever heard a more inspired work by any artist at this stage of a music career. Clapton is truly a master of the art, and to reach the apogee of his craft after 45 years is absolutely unheard of! Winwood added stellar vocals and his trademark crisp keyboard, but make no mistake; Clapton and his Fender are the star of this show. My favorite track is the cut \\"Glad\\". Eric's Fender weeps, screams, laughs and moans in the course of this tune. This CD is an absolute must for any serious Rock N Roller's library!
074322454X|5.0|I bought \\"band of Brothers\\" to my WWII fanatic son and he read it at his summer camp. Now he has watched the TV series (several times over) an there's not a single day since that I can remember that we do not have a quote, description or consideration about the book. I'll eventually read it, but right now I'm enjoying his enthusiasm for it.
0345495004|4.0|The book arrived on time and in perfect condition. The first half of the book was so excruciatingly boring that I almost didn't finish it but I forced myself to continue reading. I figured I owed it to myself and to the book club to at least get through it. The second half more than made up for the first half. Perhaps the author needed more \\"meat\\" to put on the bones of the first half of the book. After all, when Frank was in bed with the mistress by page 28, where was the suspense? The next hundred pages were pure drivel. But once I got to the middle of the book it got very good and I couldn't put it down. The last half was really  well written and interesting.
032147404X|4.0|All three volumes are written in the very same manner: one big picture on each page (like 1/3 from each page) and some text under it. Even though, i liked all books (right now I'm finishing the third volume), I love the way how the books is written (I always had the impression that Scott is right next to me and explain me various stuff), I learned some stuff but I feel like I want more than that.<br /><br />Even if the book claim to be for amateur photographers, the price for various accesories is way over an amateur budget. I don't know about you, but I'm not feeling too comfortable paying more than $300 for a light difuser or a light box, $200-300 for a tripod, and more for lights, lenses and so on. Also, most amateurs won't spend too much on an advanced digital camera like those presented in all books. I own a D40. Is low entry, I know, but that's the trick: I'm an AMATEUR, I don't want to spend a fortune on cameras and camera accessories.
B001FB55H6|5.0|The controversy and difficulties in bringing this classic graphic novel to the big screen have reached mythological, if not absurd proportions. Moore's original vision, and his resistance to its conversion into a motion picture, have been documented ad nauseum as part of the film's prolonged development cycle. As a fan of the original books, and of Moore's work in general, I was hoping for something true to the source material, and in all the ways that matter Watchmen delivers. The theatrical cut, which is the only version available as a digital copy, hits most of the fundamental points made by the books. The director's cut expands on this foundation, providing additional material that enriches the storyline, without being superfluous. Fans of the novel will enjoy the additions, while casual movie watchers might find the extended cut a bit long-winded.     The film looks and sounds beautiful on blu-ray and the included extras add value for enthusiasts, though they might not provide much of interest to the less fervent Watchmen watcher. If you enjoyed the original cut, the director's version is well worth picking up.
0694016756|5.0|ok, so we first got this book as a gift @ the hospital. I read it to my baby once, thought it was stupid and never thought about it again. He's two now and LOVES this book. We got him the oversized (lap) version, and he won't put it down. I don't know why kids loves this book so much...Who says \\"Goodnight Nobody\\"...?..   Whatever...If he likes it, I love it.
B001TM1X0O|5.0|Like many many women, I too, had a difficult time understanding men. Even when blatant signs are put in front of our faces, we will still chase a man because our heart is set on him. We make excuses for the mean things they do, and we can't do this anymore ladies!!! This book is blunt and to the point, and really pushed me to take a step to improve the way I see myself, and not make excuses for the men in my life. As I was reading this book I was actually dating a man who wouldn't call or return my calls, and who didn't want to make things \\"official\\" with me and give us a title. Reading this book made me realize, that this behavior from men is NOT normal and I am too good of a woman to accept it. So I ditched him!! I set standards for myself and if a man I met didn't meet every single one of them, I would move on, because eventually we will all find someone who does! There are too many fish in the sea to settle for one who doesn't deserve you! I stuck to that and I found a man who is exactly what I want and need! I recommend this book for every woman, not just those having relationship problems. It gave me a new sense of self, and I think everyone could use a boost of confidence in this world. READ THIS BOOK!
B001N26GFC|5.0|I have been learning to see life circumstances in a new light for about 4 years now.  My lessons started with concepts identified in the movie \\"The Secret\\" and continued with teachings of Abraham-Hicks and Dr. Wayne Dyer on CD/DVD, among various other teachers.  And it's a wonderfully liberating and happy perspective on life!<br /><br />So when I rented \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" I was thrilled to see a movie character whose attitude toward life seemed to be based on some of the ideas I have been learning. And Sally Hawkins, as Poppy, does it so beautifully! The supporting cast is just as brilliant, from Eddie Marsan as Scott (the perfect foil!), to flatmate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman), to sisters Suzy and Helen (Kate O'Flynn and Caroline Martin).<br /><br />What a breath of fresh air to see Poppy living gratefully, joyfully, in-the-moment.  I watched the movie twice before returning it to the rental store, then immediately ordered it on Amazon.  I felt I just had have this example of living life good-humoredly, and realizing that happiness is a choice. I wanted to have it on hand whenever I need the reminder.<br /><br />A word to those who can't wrap their minds around the concept that the best way to have a lovely life is to choose to be happy always, this movie will just annoy you.  But if you are willing to see what might come of responding to life gratefully and joyously at every turn, this movie is a sweet example.
0446604844|5.0|David Baldacci knows how to weave his plots and keep a reader \\"glued\\" to the book.  The intrique is riveting, and he knows how to keep the reader's attention - like staying up late to finish a section because you just don't want to wait to find out what happens.  After having read one of his books, I want to read everything that he has written (and I have read most of them as of this time).
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I have enjoyed Whitney for years.  This is however the first album in which I have liked every single song.  It is simply fun, fun, fun.
0439023491|5.0|I received this book today after months of anticipation. I basically cleared my entire schedule for the day and sat down to read. And I am so glad I did.<br /><br />Catching Fire started up pretty much just where The Hunger Games left off. Katniss explains what has happened since her and Peeta's victory at The Hunger Games. And then, at the end of Chapter One, it gets interesting. And it stays interesting the rest of the ride.<br /><br />Katniss's character grows throughout the novel. She seems at the same time strong and vulnerable. Peeta still seems a tad one-dimensional. However, this didn't distract me from the book and I say it merely in retrospect. Many new characters are introduced and while it is hard to keep track of them at first, the ones you need to know are brought sharply into focus. There are so many enjoyable new characters, and also old characters, in this book that make it fantastic.<br /><br />The setting of this book is AMAZING. I don't want to spoil anyone, and so all I can say is: when the book strays away from the districts, Miss Collins shows her incredible imagination. I was blown away. That's all I can say, and when you read, you will understand.<br /><br />As for the ending, I can't even describe how mind-blowing it was. I've seen some complaints about how abrupt it was, and that's exactly why I loved it. The last line paralyzed me. I probably sat there staring at the \\"END OF BOOK TWO\\" for a full 2 minutes.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely happy with this book. I know a book is good when I am so emotionally invested, I react out loud. There were many instances while reading Catching Fire where I screamed or gasped quite audibly. At least once my mom came in and asked what was wrong. This is a great book and I recommend it to anyone ages 13 and up.
0452295548|5.0|This was an amazing book. It really puts things in perspective and makes you realize how much we have to be grateful for.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Thought it was quite interesting, kept me interested and awaiting season 3.  Brought this for a birthday present for my daughter who is an avid fan; we watched both seasons 1 & 2 over the course of two weeks just in time to watch the first episode of season 3.  I wasn't impressed with the first two episodes of season 3 which is on TV now.  Needless to say, I'm losing interest fast.  My daughter states she will stay tuned to see if they address the previous season which left a lot of questions.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|I still remember watching Gladiator in the movie theater almost a decade ago.  It was excellent, my friends and I talked about the movie nonstop.  I even brought my girlfriend at the time to see it, and we talked about it nonstop.  It is rare for this type of movie to be embraced by females, maybe it was Russell Crowe?  Who knows, regardless this movie was a masterpiece.  Absolutely perfect from start to finish.  I purchased the DVD the day of its release ages ago and am contemplating purchasing a Blue Ray player and this would defiantly be one of the first movies I purchase.    Well, my brother happens to be a big fan of this movie as well and has a Blue Ray player.  So he invited me over so we can catch up and watch this movie on Blue Ray.  I could not tell that this was on Blue Ray.  In fact, I thought it was even worse than the DVD I have at home.  The extended parts that were included were pretty cool, but I was definitely expecting more from Blue Ray.  My brother threw in another movie afterwards to ensure me that it was just the movie, and not Blue Ray in general, and I was blown away by the quality of Sin City on Blue Ray.  So I still will give in to the Blue Ray, but not this movie.    Here I am checking out what other people think of Gladiator in Blue Ray and it looks like everyone is in agreement that it was created rather poorly.  Can this be redone?  I would definitely purchase this movie, but I already have it on DVD, so work that Blue Ray Magic!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|After watching a few other MUSE videos and not liking how shaky the camera was I was worried this may be the same way.  This DVD is great.  The camera work is really intuitive.  It doesn't jump around too much like some of the other MUSE videos I've seen.<br /><br />The audio and video seem to be matched up perfectly.  There are a ton of different point of views including an arial from a helicopter above the arena.<br /><br />I know a lot of people are disappointed that certain tracks were not included but the ones that are included are great.  This band is very talented.  The visual of this show is pretty amazing.<br /><br />The DVD does a good job of making you feel like you are there.  There are a lot of up close shots of the crowd but it doesn't get in the way.<br /><br />Good arrangements of the songs too.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I got this when it was a lightning deal for really cheap, I was actually watching this on DVD at the time I saw it. This is one of my favorite shows ever(Darn whoever thought it was a good idea to cancel it!!), and it's even better on Blu ray on my 46\\" TV.
B00005LC1H|1.0|Hoping to \\"upgrade\\" from my VHS Fawlty to DVD, I ordered the complete DVD series. Unfortunately, the set I received was defective. The disks were marked v. 1, 2 and 3, but the set actually contained TWO v. 2s, ONE v. 3 and NO v. 1. I requested a replacement for this set, and received another DEFECTIVE set identical to the above. I will be returning both sets and asking for a refund as I don't trust that I will ever receive a complete, perfect set. This series is truly one of the greats of BritCom-Dom and deserves 5+ stars, but my experience with the product quality is quite disappointing. Sybil would certainly never stand for it...
1594481717|3.0|I found this book a frustrating read for several reasons.     First of all, Pink assumes that the knowledge worker (KW) jobs just spontaneously migrated from the U.S. to certain Asian countries because of impersonal market forces, and not because American corporations decided to screw American KW's who have the gall to expect decent pay for their skills and efforts. I'll believe that major American corporations make their decisions based on economic rationality when their boards of directors start to look for much cheaper CEO's in Asian countries who can run American companies for pennies on the dollar compared to the fortunes American CEO's expect for compensation.     Secondly, what about the social costs when American corporations just trash the educational investments and personal development of American KW's? A bright American kid who would make a good knowledge worker might as well bypass college and go straight to a job at Wal-Mart right out of high school, if he'll just wind up there in a few years any way after running up absurd levels of debt trying to get KW credentials from a university education, only to discover that nobody will hire him in the field he studied for.    Third, Pink talks repeatedly about the \\"abundance\\" in our society. Yeah, it looks \\"abundant\\" if you want to buy and read novels about teenaged vampires in high school, I suppose. But our economy produces a lot of what we really need grudgingly and haphazardly, if at all, as the recent health care debate demonstrates. The economy also doesn't look \\"abundant\\" to all the people, including discarded KW's, who've lost their homes and have had to move in with relatives or into tent cities. In a properly abundant society, more and more Americans would have the ability to build up their net worth without worrying that arbitrary corporate decisions, bad government policies or elite financial swindles will destroy what they've worked and saved for.     I have to wonder if the assault on American KW's and the high incomes they used to command has reached some kind of \\"tipping point\\" which contributed to the recent economic collapse. American corporations want us to consume, but they don't want to give us enough purchasing power to do so without going into debt. Well, it serves them right if their own short-range thinking, regardless of which hemisphere of the brain that derived from, has bankrupted them.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|I bought this not realizing that it was only for PCs.  It didn't occur to me to check to make sure that it worked on Mac.  When I called the company (Sony!) they offered no solutions, so unless I can get it to work on the Mac virtual PC machine, it's just useless to me.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I think people are being too critical.. We all know her voice isn't quite the same and though we have all been waiting for the \\"comeback\\", I don't think it's fair to compare this CD to her others in the past.. I think more importantly, the goal should be to compare this CD other current releases from other artists..     I can't think of any CD I have hear/purchased lately that I can press play, listen to every track and enjoy it. This CD is definitely a welcomed exception to that. Though I favor some songs over others, I like them all. I like the mixture of pop, ballad, r&b, dance choices and while you can definitely tell that it took years to record (mainly because of the difference of the strength of her voice in each song), in the end it's still Whitney.. Deeper, raspier, wiser, healthier and yet scarred in a vulnerable, believable sort of way.. What remains is her ability to sing a song and instantly put her own signature on it, which is what I always loved about her music.     What I'm most impressed about, is what most people are complaining about.. \\"There aren't enough, high, long notes, like her older songs\\".. Personally, I'm impressed that she choose to sing the songs to the best of her vocal ability, clean em up a little and call it a day. We all know that many artists hit \\"fake\\" notes thanks to auto-tune. She could have easily manipulated notes to match her earlier stuff, but chose not to. THAT'S AMAZING!! and the sign of a true artist.    My current favorites are \\"Nothin but love\\", \\"Salute\\" \\"For the lovers\\" and \\"A song for you\\", but I'm sure that may change as I listen to the CD more..

0439023491|5.0|This is the series I've been looking for since Harry Potter came to an end - and while other writers have come close to sucking me in, only Suzanne Collins has hooked me completely. It has heavy action, post-apocalyptic horror, an awesome female narrator, and dueling \\"maybe they will, maybe they won't\\" romantic threads that keep you guessing. What makes this book series so successful though is that it offers, through Katniss, a narrator you really care about, and a complex cast of supporting characters that bring out the best (and worst) of her personality. Katniss evolves as a character as she learns new things and is exposed to more, and so the anger that surfaces in \\"Catching Fire\\" is only fitting - as is her increasingly complex romantic entanglements. (Sidenote: I'm on Team Peeta.) Collins successfully portrays war as brutal, life as complicated and frequently harsh, and love as all-consuming, confusing, an a weapon used against our enemies who identify our attachments as a source of vulnerability. She has taken all the best parts of post-apocalyptic worlds like \\"Mad Max\\" and elements of \\"Ender's Game\\" and then added her own special twists. I've got to confess, I also like that it reads like a field guide to surviving a dark future world. And perhaps most importantly, I like that Katniss has the perfect emotional palette for someone who has survived a lot at the age of seventeen and operates as a warrior - the detachment she displays is usually reserved for male narrators, and the commitment Peeta offers is usually present in female characters. Collins flips the script without being heavy handed about it (which would make both characters cheesy). In short, Collins really knows what she's doing, and I can't wait for book three.

B001GCUNW6|1.0|I haven't seen it but the others were good. I'm sure it's a good movie. I wanted to get it but can't. They are forcing us to buy both the Blu-Ray and DVD which is imoral. I would say we should boycott this so they realized the error in their judgment for doing this. If they want to throw in the dvd for free fine but making us pay for both is wrong. They should have a blu-ray only package. Also why isn't the 3-D version included, that is so B.S.
B0027WNRJ0|5.0|BOTH CD'S ARE TOTALLY EXCELLENT AND WORTH BUYING.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  IF YOU HAVE NEVER NEVER SEEN THESE GUYS, YOU SHOULD BUY BOTH PYROMANIA AND ADRENALIZE DELUXE EDITIONS.  ALSO HYSERIA DELUXE EDITIION IS WELL WOTH THE MONEY.

B000O178BY|3.0|I always try to take glowing reviews with a grain of salt, but every previous NIN album has been good enough (and With Teeth, carrying alot of production value) that I took it on faith that this album would be a \\"masterpiece\\". Well, it's not. The lack of live instruments leave the whole work sounding flat. I tried to listen to it straight through but found myself getting bored and skipping the last minute of several tracks. There's certainly some cool rhythms here, and I suspect it would be much more engrossing live or at least played loud in a large room that's alive, but  on headphones it's nothing special. I'll give the remixed release a shot since the big empty spaces in this album seem to need something.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I adore the CD. Yes...yes...yes...it's not like her formers but it's SO NEW, SO VIBRANT, fealed with EMOTION. Whitney's voice conveys so much feel good energy !Love it !!!!
0307474275|2.0|There's very little else to say about this book.  It would have been a 2 or 3 star book - but it lost one star for the relentless  (dare we say inane?) press that proclaims this book as some messianic roadmap through history.  It's an easy airplane read for when you want to kill some time (and maybe a few brain cells) but aren't looking for anything of particular import.
1400034205|4.0|Larry Darrell is the glorified image of a wannabe saint.  He is the main \\"character\\" of this novel or reminiscence although there are many other interesting upper-class American, British, and French characters as well as some low-life ones.  Maugham manages to interweave many observations and anecdotes into this tale, but the heart of the book is the story of Larry's spiritual quest.      Larry is an early personification of the 1960s call to drop out, turn on, and tune in--especially the \\"drop out\\" part.  Originally from an upper-class Illinois family Larry after his WW I experiences as a fighter pilot and hero decides that he cannot follow the accepted path.  He just wants to \\"loaf\\" (his word).  He's really on a quest to find himself and the answers to his spiritual questions.  Larry is portrayed as kind, gentle, unassuming, with no ambition in the ordinary sense, loving, unjudgemental.  Just the perfect saintly hippie.  Well he's not quite a proto-hippie because he won't take drugs (one of his girl friends is an opium addict) or drink alcohol except very lightly.  He even has magic powers to heal people learned from an Indian yogi.    This book is entertaining and interesting as a social document of the 1920s and 1930s and an exposition of various character-types especially the wannabe saint.  The Razor's Edge is absorbing except for some half-baked Eastern religious sermons tediously imposed on the reader (or in my case listener) near the end.  I recommend it.  Despite the gushing of a few other reviewers I would not consider The Razor's Edge to be great literature.  IMO some of Maugham's other works are superior.    I listened to the audio book which was very well narrated and produced.
015206057X|5.0|Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little toys is a well crafted baby book with touching poetic rhyme.  Recently I had my third son, and I saw this book during a trip to Vancouver, Canada.  This book really spoke to me not only as a dad, but also as a Children's book author.  The book is a wonderful example of a multicultural book that shows that no matter where you are from we have common ground.    The book takes us around the world and into different families.  Still, each baby has ten little fingers and ten little toes.  This is the perfect book for a preschool or a baby shower.  The illustrations fit so perfectly and naturally.    Mem Fox gives a master's class on children's book writing with this book.  I recommend this book for children and children's book authors everywhere.  Any mom, dad, or child would be happy to receive this book.    I just love it!
B00006EXDM|4.0|Let's face it: early Stones albums (and the cds that were based on them) were pretty poorly engineered. This re-mastered recording (assuming you're using decent equipment) is an audible improvement. Bass lines have more oomph, yet are more musical. Back up vocals are more distinct. Everything sound less tinny. It's not like an entirely new recording, but they have done a remarkable job considering the material with which they had to work. Whether or not this the best early compilation I won't argue: it is what it is (and I think it's pretty good). If you want to hear the early recordings of the Stones sound better than they ever have, buy it.
0439023491|5.0|I was extremely apprehensive when I read Entertainment Weekly's \\"C\\" review (there goes my subscription!).  I started the book and immediately was disappointed, as the first 130 pages seemed rushed.  I realize now that Ms. Collins was using those pages to lay the groundwork for the rest of this breath taking book.  After those pages, however, the story roars to life, leaving you shocked and dazed.<br /><br />Just as in the Hunger Games, this book keeps you awake, biting your nails and eagerly dreading the end.  The characters become more developed--I gained a better appreciation for Gale and Hamich, and fell in love with Cinna.<br /><br />Life seems a trifle dull now that this second book is over and I am anxiously awaiting the third.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The DVD set took about a week and a half to two weeks to arrive. The 7 season box set was sealed and all of the DVDs were clean and unscratched. The episode guide and pilot script were also inside and in perfect condition. This is the greatest TV show ever! Worth every penny!
0486424545|5.0|The stories of the two vastly differenct families that represent the disparities in the rapidly modernizing English society--Intellect vs. materialism, idealism vs. pragmatism, art/literature vs. buiness/wealth, and the issues about genders, relationships/marriages, death, fate, and social/economic classes.  Yet the inquiries, raised by the Schlegels sisters, particularly by the more pensive one of the two, margaret, and the manner and eloquence in which she asks these questions deeply moved me both intellectually and emotionally as well.  I think that she asks all the fundamental questions that are still relevant to all the thinking persons in our time, and her desire of \\"connecting\\" resonates throughout the book. The writing is beautiful, funny, and poignant. This is absolutely a lovely, lovely book.

B0007OY2P8|5.0|I loved the book Northanger Abbey. This is the first movie I've seen based on it, and I found it charming, provocative, and fun. Miss Morland is no great beauty, no great intellect, and no great wit, but that's ok. She is sincere, and sweet, has \\"good notions\\" about things and people, is open and teachable, but strong-willed when she knows herself in the right. Mr. Tilney is young, smart, witty, respectable, hansome, and independant -- he is \\"the catch\\", the man she could never have hoped for if he had been the least bit vain. This is a story about young love and is the cutest romance Austen ever wrote. Very glad to see such a faithful transfer from book to film. Well done, BBC!
B0000025RI|5.0|I've wanting to buy Michael Jackson's Thriller since last year in 2008. I've brought his \\"Off The Wall, Bad, &Invincible\\" cds as well. My favorite songs on the Thriller album are: of course Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Human Nature, P.Y.T., Got To Be Startin Somethin, &Baby Be Mine. I've listened to all of those songs, which were so good, I wanted to almost record them all on one of my albums. I'm an all-around instrumental musician. But the Thriller album is nice.

B0006OBPTA|4.0|It takes me back to the 80's watching The Karate kid, when martial arts was all the rage (fashion) it is a good family film which holds something for everyone, laughter suspense and the thrill of what good old Mr Miagi will show young Daniel how to defeat his enemies. Awesome family fun, go and watch it
B001NFNFIK|3.0|This movie does capture a lot of James Lee Burke's characters but misses a lot at the same time. Tommy Lee Jones is right out of the book but that is as far as it goes, I actually thought Heaven's Prisoner's made it to the big screen better because the supporting characters around Alex Baldwin were developed so well with the exception of Eric Roberts who was a little over the edge. When you read his books you are sitting in your living room swatting mosquitoes and and wiping the sweat from your neck and if the could have intermingled these two movies it would have been idyllic. But, anything that Burke wrote that makes it into a movies is worth watching.

B001UJ6IJC|4.0|First, it should be noted that this is not \\"unabridged\\".  Amazon is either incorrect or referring to the MP3 format being a direct copy of the original audio CD.  But be forewarned that the original audio CD was abridged.    Anyway, World War Z embodies the culmination of the zombie renaissance that has widespread exposure as far back as the early '00's Dawn of the Dead remake.  But Max Brooks proves that you can take a vintage concept and improve upon it, rennovate it, evolve it into something that transcends its silly roots and becomes satirical, terrifying and sophisticated.  WWZ makes The Zombie Survival Guide--a work of humorous \\"nonfiction\\" that in its own right seemed like a high-water mark--look like nothing more than the foundation stones.  WWZ has the feeling of what Max Brooks was possibly aiming at all along, the final phase in his glorious plan to give the world something beautifully absurd and expertly devised.  Max Brooks is, for lack of a better term, a mad genius.    In nothing else I've ever read (save maybe Steven Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\") have I seen one author so well accomplish his goals across the board.  There is hardly a misstep, hardly a low point or boring portion of any chapter or track on this CD.  Each story resonates in its own way, whether that be transmitting terror, anxiety, rage, indignation, humor, sentimentality, sympathy, compassion, nostalgia, intrigue, patriotism, gung ho badassery, sarcasm, satire or just plain fun at reveling in a shlocky genre.  His protean talent as a writer, technical researcher, dramatist, satirist and overall creative entity is uncanny.    But for a detailed review of the novel itself, check out its Amazon page.  This review focuses on the audio presentation.    In short, it's great, but not perfect.  The cast is a parade of talent, from Carl Reiner and Henry Rollins to Alan Alda and noted accomplished voice actor Mark Hamill.  And there's where it, for me, took a turn for the ironic.  I'm familiarwith Mark Hamill's voice work and it's usually a joy, but his rendition of Todd, the US Army veteran, seemed off kilter.  I attribute this to it being different than the version I had of Todd when reading WWZ before the audio CD came out.  Sometimes the version others invision is better than the ones in our minds.  Sometimes it's not.  This was one of those times.  There's nothing wrong with Mark Hamill's performance, per se, I just liked mine more.  I suspect others share this sentiment about various other portions of WWZ.  In another bout of irony, perhaps the consistently best performance is from none other than Brooks himself.  He's definitely inherited his father's acting talent (in truth, I'm kind of scared of this guy; unsure if there's anything he sucks at).    Here are some personal highlights:    Henry Rollins' role as the mercenary is outstanding.  Audibly, Rollins wears the skin of a hired gun well, exuding aggression.  His visual style definitely supplements the merc aesthetic.    The story of the downed pilot fighting for survival alone with only her radio has, for some reason, always seemed like the backbone of the novel to me.  It emotionally resonates; it moves me.  I don't know why.  Perhaps because it encapsulates so much of what WWZ as a whole strives to accomplish; a real microcosm of the entire novel (pain, heroism, terror, loneliness, action, etc).    All of Todd's stories are fun, but especially the later versions, once the US military rennovates itself.  There is so much retro innovation that you can't help but marvel at the ingenuity of the writing and research involved.    The girl whose family drives up to Canada is a touching moment of quiet tenderness amidst the horrors of what transpired that--again--it's hard not to marvel at the voice talent.  It represented a strangely serene respite to most of the more action-oriented pieces that zip past while remaining chilling.    Anything to do with the US President is interesting because it puts on display a great icon of leadership and the ideals that are required to step up in crises.    The story involving the Queen of England remains one of the most poignant of the lot, aided by a stereotypical British accent, but one that is rich and textured and full.  The visual imagery of the story is real nerd fodder too: castles, claymores, royalty.  I confess that it appealed to me.    The low points:    Some of the shorter stories lack resonance to the point that I can't recall enough about them to review.  But they're there.  They won't make you cringe, but they're not as salient as the rest.    There are musical intros/outtros that punctuate movements in the audio CD, accentuating the breaks in \\"parts\\" that the written novel contained.  It's a good concept that I think is flawed in this version simply by underdeveloped musical stylings; sort of one-note synth drones.  I understand the understated tension that this is supposed to mirror, but the production of it seemed cheap.    Some of the stories that didn't make it into the audio version (for whatever reason) should've been here, the Russian decimation being the most prominent in my mind.  I realize that WWZ is by no means a laconic book.  There are a slew of unnecessary anecdotes and tales in the manuscript that do little more than add to the flavor of the text--but that's great!  This was such a remarkable novel to begin with that in this rare case, more is better.  So, for me, dropping anymore than just a couple stories seems like a wasted opportunity for more greatness.  I don't think there's hope for a truly \\"unabridged\\" version, but it's just more reason to buy the book itself; you'd be short changing yourself otherwise.    However, those complaints aside, WWZ's audio CD is a master stroke of solid writing, technical knowledge, creative skill, idealism, political intrigue, brutal gory violence, social outrage, exorcisms of fears, and unparalleled fun.  More than anything, though, that's something you'll notice: Max Brooks and the cast are having a lot of fun with WWZ, and the vibe is infectious.    Whether it be used or new, World War Z is worth your time.  Its incremental nature and articulate prose make it engaging and entertaining without being laborious.  It bares its fangs while running a gamut of emotions.  And the audio CD, though trunctated and occasionally off kilter in voice acting, is a phenomenal example of what can be accomplished when you marry an iconic genre, fresh ideas, sapient knowledge, and a lack of pretention with satire.  Check out this high-water mark of the zombie renaissance, a future archetype of a genre going back to its glorious roots; you won't regret it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book because it is different from most books you read; it was written from the dogs perspective. The author did a fantastic job writing as the dog, so well that you feel like the dog is really telling you the story. I loved the dogs humor, honesty and interpretations of every day life. Even being written from the dogs perspective, the book has a meaningful story that will make you laugh and cry. It is definitely worth reading.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|Well after looking at the reviews i decided it was time to make my own.  I being someone who is a star trek fan from the next generation on i just felt it was the right place to write a review.      Pro:    -Its better looking than any star trek i have seen.      -It will keep you watching to the end and if your not into logic then yeah its for you.    Cons:  Yeah now its time     - The staples easy button does not work for movies!  Just tell the truth and admit you were lazy and didnt want to follow the story.  I would have much more respect for the writers, dirrectors if they just didnt bother with the time travel crap and said \\"We are making a new star trek and changing everything\\".    - There is 0 sense of time in the movie.  Ex:  It took the enterprise what all of 8 mins to make it from earth to vulcan in warp.  Now on the way back to earth from vulcan they were able to drop off kirk float around some in space warp in a different dirrection to meet up with the fleet then get into a fight on the bridge, turn around and head back in enough time to get to earth for the start of the fight..... oh yeah and kirk fought his way on a planet alone all and met spock and had a story and a mind meld..... In 8 mins people 8 mins.    - Why oh why were all the cadets stationed on planet earth, when they had a huge starbase circling the planet with all their ships there?????  Just a thought but wouldnt it make sense to have people on the starbase if they were on active duty so they could dispatch on time.  I dunno maybe its just me.    - Ok why was spock flying around with a tank full of that red stuff when all he needed was a drop.....  I dunno about that i mean any expert would say thats a bad idea.  Unless his military experts were doing drugs and what not at the time he left, how could anyone think thats a wise idea to let him leave with that much of the crap.  Let alone WHY would you make that much???? Takes 1 drop so why do you need 500 gallons.  (sorry i cant get over that.)    - What military expert thought it was wise to send our main fleet out to fight a battle somewhere else, not easily accessable, and leave only inexperienced rookies to protect their home world?  Over and over they kept talking about their main fleet out somewhere else... The hell were they and why could no one get in touch with them to turn em around and send em home?     - And for last.....  No one sees a problem with there being a black hole in the milky way galaxy, near pluto thats traveling at the speed of light? Much much faster than the speed of light.  So what i am getting at is how did they save earth if they made a black hole so close to earth,  thats increasing at a huge rate and moves faster than their best ship?
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Why are you reading this review? Just buy and watch. I had been in the Navy during that time and was on a WESTPAC cruise and came back in May of 1970 and knew nothing of Woodstock until the movie came out. There were 400,000 people at Woodstock and after I was transferred to the US Sub Base at New London, CT in 1972 I met a million people who claimed they were there. The original CD is the still the best and some of the out takes on the other CDs are really good but then some of the groups, such as Mountain were given way too much airtime on the new CD. This CD was the signature of a time long since gone and will never return so buy it, store it and show it to your offspring years from now as a good history lesson of a time when \\"beardless children fought wars for combat innocent tycoons-politicians who hijacked America's military\\" (quote from David Douglas Duncan).

B002BZOVLG|5.0|Last of the three Mozart-Da Ponte operas, Cosi Fan Tutte (They all do it) premiered in January 1790. Mozart was in despondent spirits during the two dark years of 1789-90. His own health was poor, his wife Constanze was also frequently ill, and money was scarce as a result of a war induced economic depression in Austria. It was during this period - in which his frequent begging letters to fellow Mason Michael Puchberg reveal his increasing desperation - that Mozart was least productive in an otherwise uncanny lifetime of stunning productivity. Mozart's operas were only moderately successful in Vienna. The Viennese audiences were notoriously conservative and found his music too difficult for their ears (\\"too many notes\\" as Emperor Joseph said of The Abduction from the Seraglio). Mozart had spectacular success in Prague, however, as the composition of Don Giovanni to be premiered in that city in 1787 proves. Despite the difficulties Mozart faced in its composition, Cosi is perhaps his most perfect opera. It contains some of the most ravishingly beautiful music he ever composed in what is essentially a chamber opera for six voices.<br /><br />This production is an ostentatiously traditional one. It seems to \\"flip-the-bird\\" at all new-fangled updatings and it proudly proclaims its stubborn adherence to 18th Century performance values. As a result it is hypermodern and ultimately subversive. The message of this Cosi is clear: see how wonderfully effective a traditional Mozart performance truly is. Why waste your time on modernizations? From the sets and stage design to costumes and performances everything suggests the period in which the opera was written. This Glyndebourne production directed by Nicholas Hytner is as much a feast for the eyes as the musical performances are a sumptuous repast for the ears. All of the vocal performers are superb (and superb looking) and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment conducted by Ivan Fischer performs this music on authentic instruments in an historically informed performance that is exemplary.<br /><br />Filmed in high-definition, this single BD50 Opus Arte Blu-Ray disc produces a  deeply colorful 16:9 1080i image and pristine audio in both Dolby TrueHD 2.0 and 5.0 soundtracks. Because of the extreme visual and audio clarity provided by the Blu-Ray format the experience is utterly immersive. One feels as if the stage is in the room producing a palpable sense of a live performance. The running time of the disc is 210 minutes.<br /><br />This is an experience not to be missed. If your equipment is capable of reproducing the full high-definition output of a Blu-Ray disc then this performance of Cosi Fan Tutte belongs in your collection. Superbly performed and presented it is most assuredly a special release.<br /><br />Mike Birmants in an historically informed performance that is exemplary.

B000009RC2|5.0|This is a seminal album from the early 70s - a \\"fusion\\" of jazz and rock long before anyone used the term.  And I would say that it is jazz influenced instrumental rock rather than today's fusion which tends to be rock influenced jazz.

If you like this album you should also buy \\"Birds of Fire\\", and vice versa.

B001DELX08|4.0|Don't be fooled by other reviews that give this higher regard  than the 1994 Covent Garden performance; only the 3rd act can  match Angela Gheorghiu's 1994 performance.  In 2007 she's old  and acts like this is her 150th repeat; in 1994 she has a freshness  and believability that makes 1994 the best available version  among all dvds. Lopardo may be wooden but that can be a viable  interpretation; Vargas just does not cut it as \\"the\\" man who  sweeps Violetta off her feet. Nucci (who I generally do not like)  is very good especially after repeated watching, and, Frontali  is just too course and gruff all the time. Maazel is no match for  Solti, who manages the soft moments magnificently.     One reviewer said this 2007 was close to Madga Olivero; no  such thing.  1994 gets closer to one of the alltime greats plus  we get to see ravishing beauty. Gheorghiu's costumes in 1994 are  also better than 2007 (with 2007's plunging necklines). It's hard  for me to believe that a better Traviata will ever be on DVD than  the 94 Covent Garden: I cry many times watching it; not one tear  occured watching the 2007 (but, but for the 94 CG, the 2007 would  be the best available version-but still no drawn tears).
0596009208|4.0|Head First Java, 2nd Edition is a well designed self-paced learning   tool.  My only complaint is the writing style sometimes makes it dif-  ficult to locate specific information.  The index is also a bit thin  for an educational text.  Example code is provided in most chapters   and answers to the exercises are also supplied.  Overall, I recommend  this book for folks trying to learn Java without enrolling in a tra-  ditional class.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  A little bit of that classic Hollywood Camp but still the greatest of the Flynn films.  This is light years ahead of Kevin Costner's tale.  Blu-Ray only makes it better.  And, if you like this, get \\"They Died With Their Boots On.\\"  You will love it.  The same cast in place in the story of George Armstrong Custer.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I had this Blu Ray shipped to me from a pre-order that I had forgotten about. So when I saw the reviews, I almost sent it back to Amazon without even opening it or watching it. Wow, I'm glad I didn't.  I decided to pop it in and the first thing that came up was a selection for me to choose the Extended cut or the Theatrical version. I was shocked! Most of the reviews stated that this was not the Extended cut. I had the option.  My HDTV is a 37 inch Sony \\"tube\\". It is very critical about picture quality. Little things show up much quicker on a tube set than on a plasma or lcd. So, let me say, the picture was fine. I have probably seen 3 Blu Ray discs out of my collection of 100 that I would feel have better picture quality. Three!  So, buy the Blu Ray. Don't worry about it. Just enjoy one of the best movies ever made!!

B00005JKN9|4.0|This film shows the brutality of New York's Five Points district set in part against the draft riots of 1863.  The characters evolve around the political scene established by Boss Tweed and Tammany Hall each recognizing the internal hierarchy of where the streets and politics come together.  To make it appealing the director threw in graphic violence and dashes of nudity, but all in all this is a good, entertaining film.    Don't use this movie as a history lesson beyond the scope of the film, it is by no means a documentary.  But take it for what it is and you will be entertained.  The film also followed the attacks of 9-11 and shows the resiliancy of New York.  The city was in flames after the military put down the draft riots, but it rose again.  Martin Scorcese wanted to show New Yorkers that they would rise again following the attacks.  He even added several still photos of the city at the very end of the film to make this point.

0316017922|4.0|This book should be an interesting read for anyone, but I particularly want to highlight the need for all educators to read it. Current educational policy needs a whack on the side of the head. (I write this as an experienced teacher neck deep in No Child Left Behind, and the policy makers' forcing \\"research based strategies\\" into our lesson plans.) Do I think the research that Gladwell cites somehow trumps current mainstream educational research? Not necessarily. But it does give the reader a chance to pull their head out of today's pervasive educational group think and consider alternatives.    For the general reader, the message that individual success involves an element of luck will, hopefully, inject a little humility back into personal self-assessments. Successful people of the past used to acknowledge that they were very lucky to have achieved their success. Today, all too many people selfishly claim that their success was solely a product of their own doing.    The only guarantee in life is that, if you don't play the game to win, you will lose. So, we must all play the game to win, recognizing that that alone does not guarantee that we will win. But, it's the only way to have a shot at winning. So, assess your innate skills, put in your 10,000 hours, and hope the luck goes your way. And, most importantly, if the luck does go your way, be humble.

0375842209|5.0|I just watched the vid clip of the author talking about his book.  First I was amazed at how young he was- I pictured someone much older but then he explains that he got the idea for this book from true stories he was told growing up, stories about those reluctantly caught up in the fire of Nazism with flames being fanned high by zealots.  I can feel the honesty, pain, the realness of many of these things truly happening.      What makes this book outstanding among books written about WWII is that he makes Death the narrator.  A death as real as the characters themselves.   This is a literary masterpiece.  Like Rembrandt on paper.  It flows like a bubbly brook leading to a raging river into a calm sea. It rings true, not contrived.  I'm glad the author enjoyed writing it and I very much enjoyed reading it.  Well Done!
0385737955|4.0|This was an excellent young adult book- just enough questions to pique the interest, just enough answers to keep you invested in the narrative. I thought Dashner did a wonderful job portraying Thomas' confusion as he seeks to make his way in a world without any true frame of reference. The descriptions of the maze and the terrors it contains are masterful- Dashner has invented a wonderful dystopian world populated by teen-aged boys trying unsuccessfully to make sense of it all.<br /><br />I was very impressed by this novel right up until the very end. I know this is the first book of a trilogy, but I would have been happier had the book ended a few pages earlier with the narrative arc completed. The introduction of a whole new underlying story in the last pages of the novel was a turn-off for me; I was planning to buy the sequel anyway, so I didn't need the sequel to start at the end of this book. I prefer books in a series to be capable of standing on their own in addition to as part of the series, and the foreshadowing at the end of this book defeats that objective.<br /><br />Regardless, still a strong four star read (would have been five if the book had ended earlier) bound to appeal to both teen and adult readers. Dashner has an interesting vision and a strong narrative voice- I look forward to the sequel.

Saw them then... still love it. Anybody have the new re-mastered gold disc? Is it it more worthy than the old disc? Better sound on it? Let me know... if so I will grab it. Check out Raw Power by the Stooges, New York Dolls 1st one, and of course.... Ziggy Stardust!

B000O599ZS|5.0|I am a big John Wayne fan but not a fan of all his movies (The Alamo for example). He won the Academy Award for True Grit but I feel he should have one for his performance in this movie. To see the emotions he goes through as the story progresses is amazing. I would recommend this movie to any person who likes a good story with great actors. Ward Bond gives one of his typical excellent supporting performances.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated. Try it and you will like it I am sure.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota.

B0026NWBY2|5.0|I very much enjoyed this CD.  I loved every song, all great George Harrison classics.  A beautiful collection.  Of course I am biased being a George Harrison fan, but I believe everyone will enjoy this CD.  Especially loved the version of Here Comes the Sun.

B001FB55H6|5.0|Absolutely brilliant film, my only complaint is the lack of character development and background on ozmandias.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|Firstly, how old does it make you feel when film-makers are making loving paeans to ye bygone era of... 1983?  Anyhow, if you were part of the culture then, or an enthusiast after-the-fact then this film will charm you.  And its depiction of the place and time are spot on: the music, the fashion, the hopelessness, the petty vandalism, the war-as-nationalistic-diversion of the Falklands, and the National Front.  It's an 80's punk rock song all grandly recreated, lacking none of the grit of the era's subject matter.  Sprinkle in the classic coming-of-age story with the evil-guy-outta-jail-comes-back theme and the film is absorbed so easily, save for the brutality of the story.  Very watchable, highly entertaining, if possibly the slightest bit cliche (but if you aren't familiar with Toots & The Maytals or Fred Perry shirts then nix that comment.)  It's funny to see Americans getting upset because they can't relate.  This story, though thoroughly English (thus the title) really has enough universality to not let the \\"funny accents\\" be a stumbling block.  Sit down, turn it on, and get spirited away to a time & place that happily hasn't fallen far from the minds of those that lived the \\"no future\\" and had to decide, each for themselves, how to press on.
1576754227|5.0|I teach Time Management workshops and love this book and recommend it to the particpants.  In a short 144 pages all the most efficient hints, tips and ways to organize your time for your fulfillment and accomplishment is summarized. I've read many longer and more detailed books on time management. This author seems to have read some of the same ones I have and summarized them nicely. Many of these tips you already know, may already be doing, and others you know you probably should do! The main sections have catchy names that are easy to remember, like, \\"Take it one oil barrel at a time\\".  Each of the 21 short sections ends with a series of questions to ask yourself how you are doing in this area. This was the book, which finally convinced me, after 10+ years of using the paper version of the Franklin Planner to move to a PDA. However, since then I'm now half paper and half online :)

0385341008|4.0|We read this book for our book group.  It is fun to read the letter format. One of our members said she felt like a voyeur looking into their lives.<br /><br />I learned a great deal about the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands which I had somehow avoided learning about previously.  The book also did an excellent job depicting life after WWII in Europe.  From an American perspective, we tend to think everyone was liberated and that was that.  This book truly shows how displaced people were, how long it took for families to reunite, how people waited for years to hear from loved ones.<br /><br />The characters are quirky and what you could imagine living on an island.  The emphasis on the role of books was well done.  As any avid reader knows, a good book can take you places- even in the middle of a war.<br /><br />The end is a bit formulaic, but aside from that, it was a very enjoyable read.  There wasn't a lot to discuss on a book group level, but we all enjoyed the book.

And not just the Mind the Gap tube stations but all of it the tunnels of the old and forgotten parts of the city!  Neverwhere is an amazing journey through the unknown and fantastical...definitely Fairy Tale worthy!  I loved the characters of Door, Hunter, the marquis de Carabas, and Richard.  It's a book you can't put down, it makes you wonder, it was Amazing!

0061537969|4.0|I loved reading the perspective from the wise dog.  As a dog owner, I have to admit, I've been much nicer to my dogs since reading this book!    The twists are somewhat predictable, but what keeps them interesting is the perspective-- what does one's life look like from the pet's point of view?      The characters are interesting.  The story moves along well.  A nice read.
1563523302|1.0|I can't believe how many people are drooling over this book.  It was full of fluff - spend wisely, hyper-consumption is not the route to take blahblahblah.

B000OVLBFS|4.0|The Jesse Stone \\"films\\", which are really CBS TV two-hour special recurring dramas, have been a big surprise in many ways. The production quality has been very high, the filming locations, in Nova Scotia, standing in for Maine, very scenic and atmospheric, the way in which the pulp genre characters and B-List former stars and character actors have been used has been keenly attuned to the needs of both Robert Parker's style and Tom Selleck's long established screen persona, the scripts have been lean and well crafted, and Tom Selleck has been wonderful, perfect, perhaps, as Jesse Stone. The first two instalments, with Viola Davis, were especially good. The score is wonderful -- is there any way to get that great music on CD?<br /><br />However, since the exit of actress Viola Davis as Jesse's fellow cop, police station manager and conscience, and the arrival of the very different Kathy Baker, in a similar role, the series has taken a definite turn into late middle aged \\"Murder She Wrote\\" torpor. The edginess that made it alluring has waned, the supporting actors have become less notable, and the recurring business about Jesse's drinking, his shrink, his dog, his indifference to being fired from his \\"last chance\\" job as chief of police, and the calls from his ex-wife have all become a little more rote, and lifeless.<br /><br />That said, there are some wonderful pulp genre elements here, and I guess I will keep watching. But they need to take stock and amp it back up a bit. It may be aimed at an older demographic, and that may even include me. But it's getting just a little too stolid, even for aging boomers with an affection for gruff but sensible Tom Selleck in a great third act role of a lifetime.

Seriously, whenever I  notice this book on my bookshelf I pick it up & hug it. I wish everyone would read  it. I am so looking forward to reading the other books this author has written.  The book is written from the dog's perspective & no emotion known to man has  been omitted from this fabulous story. His person marry's & his wife has cancer.  The dog knows this because he can smell it but can't communicate this to anyone.  What follows is a heartwarming story about the bond between two legged & four legged best friends.
B000PC1JKS|2.0|How can you call this a 30th Anniversary Edition? Even the re-mastered version of Exodus has 2 bonus tracks for crying out loud. The Deluxe Edition released in 2001 is the way to go. It contains 'Roots', one of Marley's non-album classics, 2 versions of 'Punky Reggae Party', alternative takes, tracks recorded with Lee Perry and a bunch of live tracks from the Exodus tour. Five Star rating. Why would you go any other way?     If you're looking for a 30th Anniversary Edition, pick Culture's Two Seven's Clash. Beautifully remastered with great bonus tracks. This is nothing more than marketing nonsense.
015206396X|5.0|In this world, looking different tells people something about you. Something, but not everything.  As the book summary indicates, a different look is associated with having a special ability, but the ability is not always so easy to determine.  Repeatedly in Graceling, important things hinge on these small mistakes.  It is an enthralling world, just enough removed from our own to allow readers to take comfort in the fantasy.  Teachers, note that it is close enough to an earthly world to make it accessible to less experienced fantasy readers.  It's probably best for grades 8-12 due to some of the situations, but nothing in it is terribly objectionable.
0316042994|1.0|I'd first of all like to know how many of the people who gave this book positive reviews are catholics or episcopalians. I'll bet the percentage is very high. I hate stories that try to push a religious (or any other) agenda; i.e., stories with a \\"message.\\" The first writer who discovers the meaning of life will be qualified to write a message novel. Until then, I wish all others would desist.    Aside from that, the writing is coy and pretentious--a sort of snob's \\"Rebecca,\\" though the house, the characters and the plot in DuMaurier's novel were much more interesting. Waugh should have stuck to humor and should not have tried to create great literature, which this definitely is not; what a bore he became in his old age.
0330453122|4.0|This book is based on fact. It's hard to tell how much so. The ending is something no one can know, but it's fun to think about. The rest of it is what I'm wondering about. According to what I read on the Internet, he tried 3 times to reach the summit of Everest, and died on the third attempt. The book only tells of two attempts -- author's license? Makes you wonder how much license he took with the rest of the details.<br /><br />I'd like to believe that his heirs would read this book and be pleased with it, but also that they would feel it truthfully represented Mallory's character. It's hard to know for sure if it does.<br /><br />But it makes for a good read. It's only when you read the details of their real lives that you start to wonder about the rest of it. If you read it as a great story, it's very enjoyable.

1400063515|5.0|This book is not about birds. It is about things that are very, very hard to preview because they're so unlikely to happen, as in sinking of the Titanic.<br />These things (happy accidents also) are called black swans. This writer had made a thourough study and found: black swans are everywhere. Misjudging situations, excluding the impossible keeps haunting us and after reading this book, you will see that black swans will be a permanent part of our lives. Projections deep into the future, they are in vain. Along flies this black swan and your world is changed forever. I really studied this book, for it made me look different at a whole lot of situations. Being aware, it made me accept, instead of fighting the improbable, impossible outcome. The wealth of real life, often hilarious, examples makes reading easy. It's like a novel, a wonderful gathering of thematic stories, excellently written. Madame Curie once said \\"We fear the most what we don't know\\", this book confronts us with the notion that we'll always be in that situation of uncertainty. But then again this book takes away the fear-factor and lets us deal with this problem.<br />For such a complex subject to describe, the author has done very well to keep the tone light, the language understandable, once started you can't stop reading.<br />We all should read stuff like this, to handle or be prepared for these unusual birds that fly along in this more and more complex world of ours.<br />[[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]]
B000OVLBGC|5.0|For those of you who said this movie isn't worth seeing, I don't think you know a good movie when you see one. I watched this movie in my English class and at first I thought the movie was going to be a boring foreign film not to mention irratating with the subtitles and all. But this film was amazing, the actors were great and the plot as well. I believe it deserved every award and I recommend watching it.   Subtitles aren't for everyone but this movie is worth watching.
B001CRRAE4|5.0|This review mainly focuses on the Blu-ray format--not the movie itself (the movie, of course, is great:  If you liked \\"Brazil\\", or \\"The Matrix\\" movies, or any of the 1984-ish, 'Brave New World' genre movies--you will definitely like \\"Equilibrium\\".  The movie is well paced, superbly acted (especially Christian Bale who is, as usual, outstanding), and suspensful to the end.  It is rated 'R' for the violence (lots of choreographed shooting/killing (but no gore), but little (if any--none that I can remember) profanity, and no sex). It is really more like a PG-13 movie--OK for the kids (at least teenagers) to watch.<br /><br />While the standard DVD issue had excellent video and sound, the Blu-ray transfer is nonetheless a definite improvement. It is well worth the purchase.  The bad news is that, for some reason, this movie has not been released on Blu-ray in the U.S.  The good news is that you can purchase it directly from Amazon.UK for about $20, including shipping. The Blu-ray is indeed region-free--it will play on your U.S. Blu-ray player--no problems whatsoever on my Sony player that was intended for playing only Region A (USA) discs. Purchasing from Amazon's UK site was effortless--they already knew who I was from my account information in the U.S.  The shipping was relatively fast--about a week. Since the item is being shipped from overseas, you cannot avoid the shipping charge--even if you purchase several items at the same time.<br /><br />There are several other notable Blu-rays that were only released in Europe but fortunately, are also region-free, including \\"Zulu\\" and \\"The Island\\". I also bought these directly from the United Kingdom--and they look and sound fantastic!

I didn't think it was possible, but it soooo is!!!<br /><br />The book starts 6 months after the end of the Games, right before the victor's tour. Right away you can tell that the characters have had some troubles getting comfortable in their new lives, but as the trouble escalates it's apparent that nothing has really changed.<br /><br />Catching Fire was an amazing and believable (keeping in mind that this is a futuristic society that kills people for fun,) sequel to The Hunger Games. The characters are real and relate able, even if their situations are not. Suzanne Collins is an artist when it comes to character development.<br /><br />This book will keep you thinking long after you've finished it (which won't take long, i read Catching Fire in 2 nights!) :)<br /><br />I would recommend this book to EVERYBODY along with The Hunger Games. Both books are full of action, romance, political plotting, family, friendship, and any other thing you could think of!

Albums like Music for Airports are excellent in their own right, but they lack the great vocals and energy of Here Come the Warm Jets and Taking Tiger Mountain. Here Come the Warm Jets has a mixture of pop and darker tunes, while Taking Tiger Mountain is all dark. Both of these albums are still musically current in their sound.
0307389839|4.0|Very simply written, the book is literally over in a couple of hours (the time that Murakami may take for a half marathon).    What I did like is that the book is part memoirs, part running log and part philosophy, thus appealing to a variety of readers.     What could have been better is that considering the book is marketed on the running platform, that particular aspect could have been dealt with in more depth. To name one, runners go through many obstacles - physical as well as psychological. Though Murakami touches upon this (i.e. I just lost all motivation for running after my 62 mile run and did not enjoy running for the next few years),there is no explanation on what he did to get back into the running groove, etc..The running parts seem superficial....

In this book, Reacher plays the role of investigator, working at odds with the authorities to solve a mystery with roots going back to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Along the way, he not only exhibits deduction abilities that would make Sherlock Holmes envious, he manages to escape federal custody, track down and apprehend bad guys in a city of over 8 million people, and first threaten and then team up with a United States senator.<br /><br />Though far-fetched at times, the plot is exciting, and Jack Reacher is at his investigative best. Readers familiar with Child's books won't find anything unexpected; there's violence and some language and one sex scene (unnecessary but not unexpected--Reacher always gets the girl). One description of torture is gruesome enough to make even the protagonist a little queasy.<br /><br />For pure escapist entertainment, thriller fans can't do much better than Lee Child. Gone Tomorrow will certainly please his regulars and may well generate new readers. An interesting additional element is a short-story prequel published in the New York Times and accessible through the author's Web site.
0743270754|5.0|SO GRATEFUL for the opportunity to read this history of probably our greatest President.  It will OPEN YOUR EYES to the genius that is necessary to become President as well as STAY President, most especially during a time of great upheaval.  Lincoln is almost god-like, though he would resent the image, in this wonderful history.  Thank you Ms. Goodwin!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This has become one of my favourite TV series at the moment. It is very controversial in many people's eyes, but I like this. I don't mean I like the fact he is going around killing people, what I mean is I like things that are not your typical boring story, I like something different. This is indeed that, but it is also funny, clever and entertaining. A must buy for anyone.
B000RHFZ9C|5.0|From the liner notes of the 1997 CD, \\"Sgt. Peppers Monomix\\":    \\"The only real version of Sgt. Pepper is the mono version,\\" says former Beatles sound engineer Richard Lush.  \\"There are all sorts of things on the mono, little effects here and there, which the stereo didn't have.\\"    Because stereo wasn't as commonplace in the 60s, the mono mixes were always given top priority.  That meant that in this case the mono mixing was done with much love and care, with the Beatles in attendance, whereas the stereo mixes were made in just a few hours afterward by producer George Martin alone.  Of course, stereo was soon to take over and this meant that this original mono mix with all its subtle differences (like, for example, \\"She's Leaving Home\\" played at the right speed rather than slowed down as it is on the stereo) was soon deleted.    So we belatedly celebrate the 30th anniversary of this masterpiece by releasing FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 60'S the 1967 mono mix with the tracklisting in the very order as it was originally intended, with BONUS TRACKS.    Track Listing:    1. Intro: Crowd Noise  2. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  3. With a Little Help From My Friends  4. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite  5. Fixing a Hole  6. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds  7. Getting Better  8. She's Leaving Home  9. Within You, Without You  10. When I'm Sixty-Four  11. Lovely Rita  12. Good Morning, Good Morning  13. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)  14. A Day in the Life  15. Run Out Groove  16. Applause for Sgt. Pepper    BONUS TRACKS  17. Only a Northern Song (\\"true\\" mono mix)  18. Strawberry Fields Forever (rough mix of the best unreleased orchestrated version)  19. Penny Lane (recorded \\"off\\" monitor, no flute overdubs)    From \\"The Making of Sgt. Pepper\\" TV Special; early takes of:  20. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  21. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds  22. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite  23. Within You, Without You  24. Good Morning, Good Morning  25.A Day in the Life (fading into an unused rough mix without orchestra overdub and without last chord)  26. Outro: Animal Noises (for later use in \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\")
B001E75QGG|3.0|Not the worst Indy film made and obviously not the best. In parts this was a very good film and in other parts terrible. It seems like it was made for kids in some scenes. The extras are good and well worth getting the 2 disc version. Average film, above average Blu-ray. Shows off the picture quality well in HD though, in some parts this is a beautiful movie.
0198534469|5.0|A typical judgement about this book would be as follows; \\"works good on the concepts and intuition, specially the visual/geometrical, but lacks mathematical rigor\\". But, if mathematical rigor is (for you as for me) an intrinsic logical structure beneath the argument, this book is rigorous enough even for the common math snob (I mean i don't believe that the goal of a math proof, in a textbook, is to overcome the student's moral with the full logical-set theorist notation of that proof but to make clear why the proposition is true and to make the reader think about the result). Overall it's a joyful book to read, enlightening in every chapter, the order in the presentation of the content is smooth and, have to say, the writer's attitude is modest and patient. I would recommend it to anyone with the basic knowledge related to a standard calculus course, and think it would even de of use for a graduate student in mathematics or physics.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Amazing in parts. Just jaw dropping. Very well made and shows many things never before seen on camera. This documentary shows just how beautiful our planet really is. From the deepest oceans to the highest mountains, it is all here in beautiful HD. Has to be the best blu-ray ever made yes? If you like animals, appreciate beauty, or just like documentaries, then this is a must buy.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|There are many who watch TV & Movies who want to know the entire story, from start to finish, and in just that order. There are also those of us who don't mind a story ending in a question, causing you to think and use your imagination. Thus, I felt it was brilliant of Marc Cherry & \\"Desperate Housewives\\" to flash forward 5 years, making viewers wonder what had happened in the meantime to put the lead characters in the situations being shown: Edie Britt is now married to a too-good to be true man; perfect couple Susan and Mike are divorced and she is having an affair with her housepainter; Gabrielle has become the frumpy mother of two overweight children; Bree has become a famous TV personality; and Lynette struggles with her teenage sons.<br /><br />At the end of Season 4, the show was dangerously close to \\"jumping the shark\\" by almost going over the top with some of their storylines. Jumping ahead 5 years and adding a number of surprising plot twists has kept the audience guessing. For those who love a little mystery in their TV diet, this season will keep you very full!

0786838655|4.0|[SPOILER ALERT: The ending isn't given, but some interesting information not told until 1/4 way through the book is revealed in this review]    In reading this book, I broke my two unbreakable rules:    1. Never read a book with a kid under 14 as the lead  2. Never read a book where the (even potential) romantic interest is under 16    However, ten minutes into reading--and Percy has shot water out of a fountain unintentionally spraying everyone around him while remaining dry himself--I was completely hooked. A kid whose dad is the god of the Sea? Um, that's just a no brainer to me. I absolutely love stories about demi-gods because they are partly human and partly super-awesome. So, I pretended Percy was 15 and the girl he befriends is 16 and all is well. In fact, I think that Chris Columbus, who is directing the movie coming out next February, had the exact same idea.    My review? If you love demi-gods and boys with a strong sarcastic sense of humor who also have water powers, and you can ignore the lame idea that kids like him go to \\"Camp Half-Blood\\" where they are trained in fighting and (yawn) magic items and stuff, then you will adore Percy Jackson. It's a fun, fast-paced, laugh-out-loud kind of book that keeps you reading to see what will happen to him next. What I truly loved about the book, aside from the fact that all the side characters were a hoot (especially Grover--Grover? where did that name come from???--his best friend and satyre), is that Percy himself is super lovable. At least, to me, because he's an out-spoken, spunky, dyslexic, ADD twelve-year-old, and those are my favorite kinds. Add in superpowers and I'm hooked for the entire series.    So, this review will excite you if you are exactly like me, and may turn you off if anything in here is just not your thing. All-in-all, you've got a story that is cute, entertaining and will teach you A LOT about Greek Mythology. Oh, and this is a little hint (that if I'm famous someday, people will wish they'd read this review): My next series will also be heavily focused on the gods of Greek Mythology.    As the author of Behind Every Illusion[[ASIN:B002BSHGMY Behind Every Illusion (The GreenEarth Series)]], I give a 2 thumbs up to a fellow author who can make me nearly cry when I visit the Library the next day and book 2 isn't in. Kudos!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Wonderful.  Arrived in 4 days.  I didn't understand that for my standard DVD player you have to play the disk on the other side, so after freaking out about getting a faulty box, I finally read what it said on the DVD and figured it out.  *Picard-style face palm*
B000BW7QWW|4.0|It's really too bad that the series had to come to an end, but this movie provides closure for the dedicated fans!  The story line seems to have changed a little, but not much to make a difference.  Well worth adding to your DVD collection, especially if you own the TV season on DVD.
B001USHRCK|5.0|The Lego Medieval Marketplace arrived well in advance of the estimated delivery date.  We had fun assembling it with our grandson.  He thoroughly enjoyed playing with it once it was completed.  It took less time to assemble than we thought it would.  Packages of the Legos were not numbered by steps, so we had to open all packages to begin the assembly process.  You need a very large area to spread all of the parts out on for assembly.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Anyone that says this isn't tough, must be some sort of machine.  I exercise 6 days a week and found the 20 minute workouts to be TOUGH!  Not impossible, but it definitly gets your heartrate up and makes you break a sweat.  After a short time, I started to see a change mostly in my rear and abs.  This workout is a nice change from the longer workouts that are moderately difficult for 45-60 minutes.  This works you hard, for only 20 minutes, and you can feel good about it.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I had one of these that finally shorted out on one side after years of use and my abuse. I tried to find another in stores. I couldn't, and had to order 2 of them on amazon.   Newer headphones dig into the top of my head, or have earbuds have to be jammed into my ear canal. I listen to radio and podcasts all day while at work. These phones are easy to put on, and quick to take off, which I do repeatedly all throughout the workday. They are so light on my head you can forget about them. The phones just fall in place at the entrance of the ear canals. The sound is great. The best workhorse headphone set around.
0553345834|4.0|There are many books the shelves for the seasoned executive wanting to enhance his or her skills, but very few for the new executive crop.<br />Mark McCormack gives straightforward, no nonsense advise on the subtly of business that is not taught in ANY business school. The reader gets invaluable insights into the world of \\"the street smart executive\\" and how to immediately improve their people skills. While some of McCormack's \\"notes\\" may seem obvious to an experienced executive, the lessons are great examples of how interpersonal dealings can either make or break a business relationship. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to save the pain of trial by fire as they make their way through the corporate world. This is a must read for anyone wanting to be a \\"street smart executive\\".<br /><br />John M. Vanderslice

1401923119|4.0|Bruce Lipton moves us further into the new wave of shifting our internal beliefs and perceptions to take better control of our genes and outcomes. This is indeed a contribution to the new psychology and ties with Wayne Dyer's Excuses Begone and William Glasser's Choice Theory ..a New Psychology of Personal Freedom. We have lived too long in our modern societies with blame and predeterminism, reducing personal responsibility to a limited place.  It is refreshing to read how we can and must take control of our lives and learn how to influence our young so that they can direct their lives and outcomes without falling prey to external controls such as bullies, blame and propaganda.    As a child worker and educational consultant I have found this information an inspiration to further direct children in how to get in touch with their belief system before detrimental beliefs and attitudes can contaminate their path to personal freedom and fulfillment but even more so to preserve personal wellness and mental health    Daphni Clifton , Vancouver, BC
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This DVD concert is absolutely Fantastic! Celine Dion is one of the best performers I have ever seen. She is elegant, graceful, and yet totally vivacious. An Amazing voice just adds to her beauty.<br />The dancers and musicians with her are awesome. They help her make one hell of an entertaining show. The Only way it could have been better is if I were able to see it in person, but this way I can watch it anytime I want to.<br />Definitely worth the money.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|My first memory of my father is watching Michael Jackson perform Billie Jean on Motown Live.  I have been a fan ever since.  This album should be as essential to the music collector's portfolio as the original Star Wars trilogy or the Indiana Jones Saga is to a movie buff's rack.  Thriller in particular, over the dramatic effects of all of Michael Jackson's work, shaped the way pop music is heard today.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I purchased this cd not knowing what to expect but knowing that I was getting something from the greatest singer in the world. Since my purchase I have carried my cd from home to car, from car to office, back to car, back to home and just cannot stop listening to this. Every song has a special meaning to me; from the loss of a loved one, financial struggles and relationships. It just fits my life experiences and helps with the past, the present and gives hope for the future. I recommend everyone purchase this cd for personal inspiration. Or give it as a gift for someone going thru any life issues. Welcome back Whitney!!
B00005QGAX|5.0|There isn't much you can say about the work of Michael Jackson through the '80s and into the early '90s.  What fascinates me about this album is the interview with Quincy Jones that they included at the end.  His fondness for the work with Michael and the discussions over the process of music production are enlightening and entertaining.  This is another 'must have' for any music collector.
B00006JKOM|5.0|The best of Tull's theme albums and a great album for any of you out there that appreciate real music (with true R & B roots), not the canned crap that the industry pours upon the mindless masses!

1595141715|5.0|I have never written a review for a book before, nor have I been much of a reader in the past. Aside from reading for school and the Harry Potter series, I often pass by a book that seems interesting, simply because it takes so much to hold my attention. I normally end up forgetting about certain books after only reading a few chapters, but I can proudly say \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" is the best book I have read in quite some time. I'm a sophomore in high school, and the minute I picked up this book, I wasn't able to put it down. I finished it in two days, and the plot line kept moving along while holding my interest. I look forward to seeing great things from Jay Asher, and I am definitely going to be recommending this book to all of my friends.
0307269981|4.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire is better than the first book -- and I adored the first book, so that's saying something. In this second book of the trilogy, we learn about Lisbeth -- everything from what she did right after the first book ended to what made her the person she became -- in a complicated, intricately plotted story.<br /><br />The opening scenes with Lisbeth enjoying new riches on the beach didn't seem to add much to the story, but once she was home in Europe, wham! It was like a roller coaster taking off, with journalists doing their thing, sex traders doing their thing, killers doing their thing and Lisbeth doing her thing.<br /><br />The story, told through various characters' perspectives, is gripping and entertaining. And the ending is great -- answering questions but raising new ones.<br /><br />When is book three coming out in the U.S.??
B00000K3CK|5.0|Great movie, fast shipping from Amazon, we are very pleased with our purchase.  This movie is a classic. If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you have, buy it.  This is one of those \\"Watch every season\\" kinda movies.   You'll like it. I promise!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I wish I could give this Michael Jackson dvd 20 stars.This DVD is absolutely wonderful. The performances on this dvd are truly amazing. I love all of the performances, but the dancing in Smooth Criminal is outstanding. Also, the performance of Man in the Mirror is a wonderful way to close out the concert. The performance of Man in the Mirror is so moving and heartfelt. This dvd is a must have for any Michael Jackson fan and I really love it.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|The Good<br />Growing up I never professed to being the biggest Rush fan. In fact, I hated them. I've never owned a Rush album or enjoyed a song. I usually mock Geddy Lee's voice when one of their songs come in the radio. Once I was sent a copy of the Rush R:30 DVD in 2005, all that changed. I still don't care much for their music, but I respect it. The technical aspects, the live ambience, and the musicianship cannot be denied. So I was more than anxious to see if Snakes and Arrows Live lived up to the powerhouse that was R:30.<br /><br />This DVD collection is broken into three disc. Disc 1 features the first set of the main concert. \\"Limelight\\" kicks things off on this eleven song set, and Rush never look back. They make their intricate sounds look and sound so easy. The crowd is certainly into it and the sound quality is superb. Also on the first disc are the bonus features. The features included are promotional clips and videos for the Snakes and Arrows release, as well as alternate camera angles for the main concert. You even get a live performance left off the R:30 DVD. Be sure to check out the hilarious outtakes included on the disc.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains the second set of the concert (and most of the songs I recognize), as well as the encore set. The second DVD is just as superb as the first. There are no bonus features on this disc, but the third DVD could certainly fill that void. Disc three is titled Oh, Atlanta, The Authorized Bootlegs. This disc features five liver performances that didn't appear on the main DVDs.<br /><br />The Bad<br />Nothing<br /><br />The Verdict<br />You don't have to be a fan to enjoy a Rush concert. Snakes and Arrows Live features another fantastic performance by the Canadian prog-rockers. A must have for fans, and a must have for music lovers in general. Now if someone can explain the significance of the rotisserie on stage.

B001G5IJVK|4.0|The Good<br />Ikons is the latest box set by Kiss. It's a four CD collection that features highlights from each individual member of the group. The packaging is exceptional with high gloss photos of the group and each disc is color coded to the shade that best represents the band member. Through the the little hole of the disc is the face of the member it is highlighting. The pictures are similar to what Kiss did when the released solo albums in the seventies. Now on to the music.<br /><br />The Demon (Red) highlights the Kiss material that Gene wrote and performed with the group. The material ranges focuses on Kiss material from the 70s and Gene's solo album. \\"God of Thunder\\" (oddly written by Paul Stanley) kicks the set off. This of course is Gene's signature track when performing live. It's a little different than the one you're used to, as this is the album version. The bass still rocks you foundation. Other Kiss classics include \\"Calling Dr. Love,\\" \\"Chirsteen Sixteen,\\" \\"Deuce,\\" \\"Rock and Roll All Nite,\\" \\"Cold Gin,\\" and \\"Parasite.\\" Lesser known songs such as \\"Ladies Room\\" and \\"Larger Than Life\\" are good, but it is obvious why they have not appeared on any greatest hits albums.<br /><br />The Star Child (Purple) highlights Paul Stanley. As much as Simmons is tied to some Kiss hits, without Stanley's tracks (and vocals), the group would have never flourished.\\"Detroit Rock City,\\" \\"Love Gun,\\" \\"Strutter,\\" \\"Do You Love Me,\\" \\"I Stole Your Love,\\" and \\"I Was Made for Loving You\\" are all instantly recognizable. Paul too keeps it in the 70s. \\"Wouldn't You Like to Know Me\\" is a stellar track from Stanley's solo album.<br /><br />Space Ace (Blue) highlights the fact that Frehley may actually be from the great beyond. \\"2000 Man,\\" \\"Dark Light,\\" and \\"Rocket Ride\\" truly have Ace reaching for the stars. Sure they're aren't as many hits on this disc than on Gene & Paul's, but there still are some quality tracks and minor hits for the group. \\"New York Groove\\" has a great beat and rhythm that will make your head bounce. \\"Speeding Back to My Baby\\" was co-written by Jeanette Frehley and has a sweet tone to it. Most of the tracks revolve around Ace's blusey guitar tones and gritty vocals. \\"Rip It Out\\" was quite the shocker as it sounded every bit as good as a Kiss hit. It came from his solo effort, as did most of the material here. Ace even has a track from the 1998 Kiss reunion album Psycho Circus. What's that say about Paul and Gene's contribution to that effort?<br /><br />The Cat Man (Green) highlights drummer Peter Criss who, despite being assigned the sappiest ballad ever (\\"Beth\\"), manages to crank out a few rock tunes. Every Kiss fan knows \\"Hard Luck Woman,\\" but \\"Dirty Livin'\\" is the perfect personification of the group. I wonder why it never caught on as a fan favorite. \\"Black Diamond\\" is the only other (minor) hit Criss contributed to the group. His disc is solo album heavy. On top of that, Criss is more of a crooner than a rocker. Think of Barry Manilow with more guitar. It's not necessarily bad, but sometimes a drummer should be a drummer.<br /><br />The Bad<br />Each member has a song or two (from their 70s solo efforts) that could have been left off without any complaints.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|To get this product at this price, and hear what I hear during gaming? you think im gonna complain about 5.1 surrond sound? LOL! Listen, im very happy with this product, and have NO REGRETS!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|A gem that features so many classic MJ songs.  A must for all MJ fans.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood is extraordinary. He acts, he directs, he produces, and even has an active hand in the music. If any human deserved and Oscar for this production it was Mr. Eastwood. He reminds me of a really fine wine, the older he gets, the better he gets. God Speed, Clint.
B00000721B|5.0|I bought this before attending his concert at Fenway Park.  It really inspired me to see the show.  Non stop great music.  Not a bad cut.  A retrospective of his brilliant career.  Worth the purchase!
B00007BKVC|4.0|A tragic comedy of two mainly female loving kissing each other and their interactions with a real world on a beautiful landscapes of Grand Canyon and blue-sky US.<br /><br />There is something in this work.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Not her best CD but still worth listening to.  It grows on you after a few listens.  It's nice to have Ms. Houston back on the scene again after such a long absence.  She still has a powerful voice and uses it well.
0140311254|5.0|They were my first and third orders on Amazon, and I'm a believer in the quality and effectiveness of ordering on-line.
B00005QGAV|5.0|One of the best albums Michael Jackson has ever released.  A gem!  Solid music throughout.
1596590688|5.0|Really good book.  For business owners who would be hard pressed to figure out who is more moronic, competitors or customers.  When you have something no one else does, everything changes...In one hour I invented a service that never existed because of this book, and it validated other ideas I had.  As good a book as you will ever read...total paradigm shift.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|A classic... always great music to listen to.  Songs have been remastered to a good effect.
143329351X|5.0|It is really interesting hearing a book read in the author's own voice.  At first I thought his voice wasn't quite suited to the story.  I'm used to hearing audiobooks read by people who do it for a living.  They know how to make things sound and probably work hard getting the voices right.  But as it went on, I began to realize what a privilege it is to listen to the book read by the author himself.  You can hear exactly the way he wanted you to read certain lines.  I have a deeper understanding of the book because of this and all the insights he gives at the beginning and end of each chapter.  It's absolutely fantastic.  Highly recommend this book.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|MJ at his very best.  Every MJ fan should have a copy of this DVD.  Have a party and listen on... all your guests will love you for it.
0805047905|5.0|This book is a classic! I purchase it for every new baby I know! You will not go wrong with this book!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I just got my PS3 Slim about two days ago and i bought the Real Triggers with it. I thought they would be only mediocre but it turned out to be the best $4.00 i've ever spent. My fingers never slip off the R2 and L2 triggers anymore.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|To be honest, I've never heard of Jason Mraz before, well until I found out that his ticket concert in Java Jazz Festival 2009 were sold out.  so in my curiosity I tried listen his albums, through the sample tracks on Amazon. within moments loved the songs in this We Sing, We Dance, We steal things, and Live High, Butterfly, Lucky and I'm Yours were my instant favourites at that time, but after the CD/DVD arrived, I Loved ALMOST all of the songs there.    A details from this product:  Disc 1, the album: contains 12 songs.  Disc 2, the Eps: contain 12 songs, incl the acoustic/live/alt. version of I'm Yours, Live Hig, Make it Mine, etc. too bad there's no alt. version of 'Lucky'.  Disc 3, The DVD: contain 15 live performance and a short documentary.    If you haven't got the regular album of We Sing, We Dance, We steal things, get this one!  If you already have, got this one too! it's worth the price.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I just happened onto a David Garrett CPTV special and was so taken with his music.  Purchased this CD the very next day.  I really enjoy his interpretation of the music and especially like his original Chelsea Girl. I will be purchasing more of his CD's in the near future.  Give it a try, you will love it.
B000MKXEME|4.0|This has to be one of the best low budget horror films ever made.  The acting is fair, the special effects are fantastic. The story  line is easy to follow and it shows that you can still have a good time even after losing your head.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This movie should be considered a \\"classic\\". I greatly enjoyed it and was surprised to learn it was 10 years old. One of the major themes that resonated with me was the idea that people won't know their true capabilities until they are thrown into a situation where they need to rise to the challenge. Another important point that came across in the movie is that everyone needs to work together to succeed, and that there is nothing wrong with asking for help. This is a movie that is fun and makes you feel good. In the age of dark and pessimistic movies, Galaxy Quest is rare gem.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never done workout videos before, but I really wanted to tone up and build better upper body strength. I have been doing this every single day and am on my 21st day. I started the first week with level 1, moved to level 2 for the second week and now am finishing out on level 3. I can't believe how my heart rate gets up and going and muscles burning in only a 20 minute time frame. I've defiantly noticed improvements. I don't have a 6 pack yet, but I believe it will get there! I can see definition in my arms too. I typically do the workout in the mornings and it gives me a great jumpstart to the day. Would highly recommend this to anyone, boys or girls.
0810970686|5.0|I have purchased several copies of all of the Wimpie Diaries for my grandchildren, little friends, library fundraisers, etc.  These books are GREAT, children WANT to READ them.  As a read-aholic I firmly believe that children should own their favorite books for a lifetime.  The Wimpie Diaries are imaginative, entertaining, and kids love to read them.  What a great idea, kids reading.
B000V6BE6C|1.0|So they had a boring debut (\\"Sounding The 7th Trumpet\\") but came back with a KILLER sophomore effort (2003's \\"Waking The Fallen\\") that made me think they were the next big thing. Then came \\"City of Evil,\\" which featured cheesy hair-metal riffs, annoyingly whiny lead guitar lines, and even cheesier 80's hair-metal vocals. BOO! But the boys have returned......EVEN WORSE! (Just listen to \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" and if you laugh harder than I do, you just might die from a heart attack). On a serious note, don't buy this. You will be mad at yourself. Get \\"Waking The Fallen\\" and just put it on repeat.
0307266303|4.0|This is a fantastic book about running and runners.  The great race, while the main storyline of the book, took second place to the intriguing characters and terrain involved.  I also enjoyed the insights into footwear and endurance that the author provides in great detail.  My only problem with the book is the heavy discussion of evolution, a theory which I disagree with. Other than that it was a fun and inspiring book!
B000EWBKKI|1.0|An average to poor release with only slightly better than DVD Picture Quality and just a standard definition Dolby Digital soundtrack (probably straight from the earlier DVD releases)... Where is the uncompressed LPCM, Dolby TrueHD, or DTS-HD MA audio track? The [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray]]] (or it's Steel Tin special edition version) is a much better release with better picture and a true HD soundtrack.
B00278U1W0|1.0|I am a fan of both Eric Clapton's and Steve Winwood's previous works.  This Blu-ray, however has disappointed me, primarily due to extremely poor quality audio.  If you appreciate good audio tracks, this Blu-ray is not for you.  I find it hard to understand how such accomplished artists have allowed this sub-standard product to be marketed.  This is not typical hi-rez Blu-ray audio.  Save your dough.
0545123267|5.0|When I first purchased this book I was supremely excited. That being said, that was a shocking emotion for me because I simply HATE werewolf novels. The only one I have ever enjoyed was Blood and Chocolate by Annette Curtis Klause.     But Shiver was different. Sam and Grace's story is quite possibly one of my favorite stories ever. Sure, it isn't the greatest novel, but I happen to love it. The only thing I didn't like was that she described Sam as having emo hair, and that just doesn't appeal to me. But other than that, the story is unique and charming. I wanted to cry throughout the book, and I fell in love with the characters. The ending is really good, so keep reading!    I devoured it quickly, but suggest you take your time. Living as Sam and Grace do sets the mood a little more.    Enjoy it. I can't wait to read Maggie Stiefvater's novel, Lament, now that I have experienced a taste of her style.
0765322889|5.0|This series blows me away. Having just finished book 6 and avidly waiting books 7, 8, and 9, I feel obliged to add a review on book one to clarify some of the reviews on here. One review says that there are a lot of extraneous plot lines. As you progress through the series, you come to realize that nothing is accidental or added for filler. 'Gods below' at 1000 pages these books do not need filler content. As a comparison Jordan's Wheel of Time series is a quagmire of useless information and plot lines, not to mention the frustrating lack of development for literally books. While i felt I had to plow through his series, I glide through Erikson's.     With scores of protagonists and antagonists and interweaving plots, deceptions and betrayals, this book is not for the casual reader. But if you can take it on, the rich characters, incredible and sometimes incredibly witty dialogue, relationships and twists and turns are absolutely amazing. I love Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' and while the two series share similarities, Martin's does not hold a frozen candle to 'Malazan book of the Fallen'.     Pick this one up, you'll be glad you did.
B000002MX7|1.0|I waited and waited and finally received an email that I wouldn't be receiving my CD.  It was a birthday gift and I had to scramble.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I have to say that I love what whitney's teams done with this album. She is back...  This song, This song for you, you, you....
B000WGWQG8|5.0|One of the very best ministeries I have ever seen HBO did an excellant recreation.  History was accurate, too.
0345495004|4.0|This is a remarkable novel. It reads often like the autobiography of one of its two protagonists, the little known but infamous Mrs. Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Mamah comes across as calm, noble, deeply feeling. She and Frank Lloyd Wright were both geniuses, in their different ways, and as such would seem impossible to write. Horan manages to invoke Wright's genius, exploring his private and personal faults as well as his great accomplishments, yet rarely making him seem just ordinary.     Horan invents several powerful passages of love or complaint about Frank, his lying ways, his hypocritical disdain for the democratic common man, his monstrous indebtedness.  Always to be a child, wildly enthusiastic, impulsive, and infectiously creative, was his great gift, and bane. Horan manages that aspect of his personality magnificently. She is less concerned with his architecture, with how he was able to turn a space and a place into beauty, beautiful in clever simplicity and repose, and how Mamah might have contributed.      I felt Horan hewed too closely to the historical record of their relationship, afraid to venture into speculative passions, too concerned with building a \\"reputation\\" for the really very little known Mamah. Horan did not expressively create a full depth of emotion, to show how the relationship of Frank and Mamah HAD TO BE. She says so, but falls just short of showing it. Part of this shortcoming is our not getting a good feel for just how talented Mamah was, nor any real idea of how she might have pushed Wright as an artist. Maybe she didn't, but this is supposed to be fiction about a little-known person juxtaposed with a  toweringly famous one, where author's license ought to apply. Still, Horan is the first author I've read who makes intuitive good sense of their final tragedy.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Go 'head Miss Whitney.  She's back in full effect and ready 2 sing 4 us again the way she knows best.  This is a strong set of tracks that define who Whitney is and signifies what's been going on In Whitney's world.  A testimony of her heart and soul.  I think she needed to take a step back and do alot of inner work to get back to who Whitney is. Singing does come straight from the soul and when you have your soul intact everything else follows according to plan.  The standout tracks for me are \\"Call U 2Nite\\" (one of Whitney's best songs ever), \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", \\"Nuthin' But Luv\\" (it grew on me!) \\"I Look 2 U\\", \\"I Didn't Know M' Own Strenth\\" and \\"Salute\\", a creative song with orignal lyrics and good vocals.  The other songs are pretty much average but collectively this is a cd that flows and has a good energy with alot of good positive messages.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Mr. Bobinsky: Caroline, wait! The mice asked me to give you message.  Coraline Jones: The jumping mice?  Mr. Bobinsky: They are saying: Do not go through little door. Do you know such a thing?  Coraline Jones: The one behind the wallpaper? But it's all bricked up.  Mr. Bobinsky: Ah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the mice are a little mixed up. They even get your name wrong, you know? They call you \\"Coraline\\" instead of \\"Caroline  ^^    This movie is awesome, and a must have for all fans of Tim Burton, or other Animation Movies
0439023491|5.0|Just tell me when book 3 is coming! ARGH! Yes, okay, it was fantastic--just as good as The Hunger Games. But OBVIOUSLY it's not over, and I want to know when I get to read the rest.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|When I first saw just a snipit of this movie (by accident - it was on the tv at the nail salon), I just had to buy it to watch it again - from the beginning. It touches every emotion and \\"pulls\\" you in. Not surprised in the least that it won so many awards! Definitely a keeper - one to watch over and over again.
0307408833|2.0|I got this book thinking I would be able to make some nice gluten-free treats easily, but, the recipes use lots of coconut based ingredients that are very pricey and unfortunately, I can't eat much coconut. I agree with others that the bean based flour mixes taste vile. I don't see how this bakery uses this mix, but, then, I guess I would eat dirt if it had enough icing on it! :) I admire how this bakery cares so much about it's product and how they use natural colors in their baked goods, but, the difficulty in obtaining some of the ingredients, and their expense, is just too much for me. I will be donating my book to the Salvation Army.
B000002UAX|3.0|There is some Beatle brilliance on this album of course. It appears very obvious to me though that The Beatles were trying to keep up with Brian Wilson's experimentation & use of various instruments & orchestral sound of Pet Sounds.
B001TH28EY|3.0|The most illustrious recording in this incomplete set is Lucio Silla, being the complete version of Mozart's work. Similarly, the Cosi fan tutte includes complete arias not commonly available in other recordings.<br />However Mozart's first opera (in Latin) Apollo et Hyacinthus, K.38 is missing.<br />The notes say that they include the complete Italian operas and German singspiels. So as of right, the Latin opera Apollo et Hyacinthus was missing, I suppose.<br />Caveat emptor.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|The DVD was in great condition as was the case. It arrived quicker than originally promised. I would buy from them again! Thank you.
B0028T6XXY|2.0|As much as I love Michael, I have to say this DVD/CD is the worst he has put out so far. I am so glad I am not the only one feeling that way.    As a true fan, we love Michael for his singing talent and stage performance.    It is great to see a little behind the stage footage. But (with a capital B), those footage should only be \\"extras\\" on a DVD, a B side release if you will. It seems to me that there wasn't enough material to be released on a full 1 1/2 to 2 hours DVD so they have to cheat us with those footage to make up the bulk of the DVD content. If you look and listen closely, it is basically an empty release.    Michael is a great singer, I would appreciate the release a lot more if it captures the big bulk of the concert event (if not whole). Think of \\"Caught In The Act\\", it was a way more superb release and much much more satisfying for those people who wasn't there for any of Michael's concerts.    With that huge disappointment in mind, I didn't care about putting the CD to play because it's the same content as the DVD.    Please stop cheating us, Mr Buble. Fans will change camp if you continue this trend!!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|All of the songs are great. Half of the songs are potential hit singles. Whitney and the team worked really hard; I can tell. The truth is that most entertainers would have overdosed and died but somehow Whitney made it. Wow! I'm glad to have her back. . . great CD!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney, I look to YOU with admiration and respect.  It wasnt too long ago that everyone watched your addiction take its toll.  I wondered if you would even fight back for your life let alone make another Album.  I'm relieved you chose to FIND YOUR HIGHER SELF.  And, celebrate it with your fans.  I played your CD all day yesterday.  It FELT like a celebration to hear your new songs.  You've been missed.  And your beauty is back in YOU and your music.    Awesome CD.
3822817015|5.0|The book is a nice introduction and explanation to the various styles of different artists in the pin-up genre.  I have always been a fan of pin-ups, but definitely prefer a particular style of pin-ups.  This book allowed me to look at many different artists, see excellent pictures of their work, and find those that I can now research a bit more.  Great book!
B001BKG9SK|5.0|The CD/DVD was in excellent shape and appeared to be brand new, although supposedly it was used. I'm very happy with this purchase, especially in light of the fact I've never purchased a used CD/DVD online before, and nothing from Amazon before. I've told a number of people how pleased I am regarding this purchase.
0060760710|5.0|The entire book was just lovely. The stories were light, wonderful, and so adorable. Mr. and Mrs. Brown were lovely, as were their children and Mrs. Bird. Paddington himself was such an adventurous little bear and you liked him immediately upon meeting him.<br /><br />This is the most adorable book and quite nice for all ages - whether to introduce a young one to Paddington for the first time or to revisit a beloved childhood friend. Paddington stands up well to the test of the years. Stephen Fry did an absolutely amazing job with the reading. I can imagine no one who could have done it better. It was simply flawless. He is always amazing, but his talent truly shined here. Really, I simply cannot describe how wonderful he was! I fell in love with Paddington all over again!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I always enjoy ordering from Amazon and like my other orders my shipment came in good condition and I am enjoying my Jane Austen movie! Thanks Amazon
B001K3JF7K|4.0|It's a great album, especially for the idea of involving Claus Ogermann, one of the best artist in arrangement for bossa nova songs. Sometimes I find it too \\"slow\\", but it' ok like this.
0061122416|3.0|I wish there were a \\"3.5 star\\" rating because I found the book more enjoyable than average, but upon relfection, think the message somewhat shallow. The \\"follow your heart\\" theme is wonderfully woven throughout the plot, and I enjoyed it immensely. However, I was disappointed by the \\"over-the-top\\" culmination of the boy's journey which offers little practical advice for us mere mortals in search of our dreams.    A wonderful read of limited practical value.
B001BWQVUO|5.0|Great documentary! I do recommend it to anyone interested in music. It shows how the Venezuelan system of child and youth orchestras promotes classical music among children, motivating and keeping them out of the streets. The system has yielded many professional musicians, playing in different top-level orchestras around the world. This is the case of Gustavo Dudamel, who is now musical director and conductor of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles. Fun to watch and touching.    Excelente documental! Lo recomiendo a cualquiera que esté interesado en la música. Muestra cómo el sistema de orquestas infantiles y juveniles de Venezuela promueve la música clásica entre niños y jóvenes, motivándolos y manteniéndolos fuera de las calles. El sistema ha producido muchos músicos profesionales, algunos de los cuales tocan en orquestas de alto nivel alrededor del mundo. Es el caso de Gustavo Dudamel, quien es ahora el director musical de la Orquesta Filarmónica de los Angeles. Divertido y conmovedor.
0385341008|5.0|I just finished this book and I could not put it down. When it ended, I wanted more. A lot more. This is a great book that is really easy to read and is just a delight to read. The characters are great, the story is heart-breaking (but in a good way), and you will be looking to book a ticket to the island when you finished! I can's say enough good things, but don't miss this one!
0385340575|4.0|There story reads like a downhill race from a high mountain. The plot, staying on the fine line of fictional reality, takes many hairpin turns at an ever faster pace. In the between these curves there is time for some observation and sarcastic wit, whithout slowing the story down. So the momentum keeps building and the final is delivered with great speed and punch. Nice work!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a must see movie no matter what your age is. It is about real life and how a person can be beaten down by negativity, but can learn to tap into the child we all have inside us and reinvent himself. The movie is about the life of this old man. He has always wanted to go on adventures and he finds a soul mate who shares his dreams and they eventually get married. But they had to set aside their dreams of adventure in the real world of adulthood, but they still had their dreams. But one day she dies and not only does he have to learn to live without her, but everyone is telling him because of his age he needs to go into the nursing home. He is old and can't take care of himself and he just about gives up when he goes through his and his wife's scrapbook and decides to set out on his adventure. Through this movie he learns he isn't worthless and useless. He regains his self confidence and remakes himself. It is a beautifully done story and everyone really needs to see it.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This Season was awesome... the total serie is great... good libretto, in few words is a serie that show the life in a similar perspective
031606792X|1.0|I just read straight through the TWILIGHT saga, because the first three books are a genuine Guilty Pleasure.  With the first three, I just couldn't put them down.  Then I got to BREAKING DAWN.  It is just awful.  I had to force myself to read it, because it's badly written, badly edited, waaaay too long, and makes very little sense.  It also lacks any dramatic tension, as Bella (whose \\"I'm so clumsy and I hate girly stuff\\" act got VERY old in this book, especially in the wedding scenes) gets every door prize with amazing ease.  And the childbirth scene was not only revolting, but ridiculous.  I kept saying \\"Meyer can't be serious!\\"  BTW, I bet uberdarling gag-making Renesmee Carlie legally changes her name the moment she's of age!
0142501123|5.0|Same author as the Gruffalo.  The book has wonderful rhyming and excellent pictures as well.  My version has the phrasing something like \\"just once I'll have witch without fries'.  No drooling in my edition.  I think I like this version better anyway.  The story basically has one character after another hopping on to the broom until there are so many, it breaks and down they come.
0061537969|5.0|Was a touching read after just having to put my dog down.  The best part is that the book is written by the dog, which adds a twist coming from an animal and the ending alone is worth the read.
B000WTZ784|5.0|Big Genesis fan. Keyboard player here who admires the work of Tony Banks. I haven't researched this album, but I'm sure Tony probably wrote most?  Own every album they have ever produced, and can't count the number of times I've seen them in concert.    This is a great album and too bad it didn't hit the charts in a big way.  Not your classic \\"Genesis\\", but I love all of the music here. You can pick up traces of their classic style in a lot of the songs. Ray is great and perfect for the vocals here, but sure would like to hear what Collins would have done with the music also.    Not sure why they didn't play more of these in live concerts.    Would certainly recommend this album to anyone who likes the music of Genesis!
0307269981|5.0|Just finished GWPWF...wow...absolutely loved it, devoured it, got a crick in my shoulders from the tension created by reading the end of the book. I love Salander, she grew on me during GWTDT. But this book brought her to life and the fact she is now the protagonist is what makes this book better than the first. Highly recommend reading GWTDT first. May have to reread names to remember who's who, but it is worth it. And I hope that certain events in the ending do not change the way her brain works one iota. Starving for the 3rd book.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|For those looking for the old Whitney, or the Whitney from a few years ago \\"My love is your love\\", you will be sorely disappointed, but this is a good solid CD.   No, Whitney is not at her best vocally, but she has aged, and her voice has matured.  I bought this skeptically, and am pleased.    This is a good investment.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|This movie is intense. Heath Ledger does an eerily wonderful job playing The Joker, and the story is portrayed meticulously. Be warned that it is very dark. If you're looking for a light-hearted comedy, The Dark Knight is far from your pick. But if you are looking for a graphic action-packed superhero thriller with an intricate plot and fast-paced scenes, Batman is right on the money.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael Jackson's album \\"Dangerous\\" is the best album of all to me. The song Dangerous is one of the most<br />heartfelt, melodies on the record. You never want this song to end. Michael changes the beat...in a talented way. You start off dancing, you end up listening to the change of beat and all you want to do is replay Dangerous over and over again. With the beats of Dangerous, I am often stopped in my car by neighboring drivers to ask where did I get the awesome \\"MJ\\" song.<br /><br />I can visually see michael breaking, and snaking on Dangerous. The video for Dangerous is totally awesome as well. Enjoy.
141694737X|5.0|My 13 month old LOVES books, and I just got her several new ones based on Amazon reviews.  They're all good, but this one is BY FAR HER FAVORITE!  She hands it to us to \\"read\\" to her over and over and over again.  The monkey is her favorite page.  Highly recommend this little book.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Fans of the Southern Vampire/Sookie Stackhouse novels will find some overlap as well as some discrepancies between the show and the books.  Both are fun new twists on the old vampire myth, but the show incorporates the artistic vision of Alan Ball into a truly unique production.  True Blood has an amazing ensemble cast, with fantastic performances and deeply nuanced characters.  The show is visually stunning at times, with color, light, and dark complementing the characters on screen. The subtle score, with smooth cello riffs in a minor key forms a stark contrast to the bluesy, twangy, hip songs of the soundtrack, and together make the emotions of the scenes pop. The interaction among the cast brings you into a world where you feel like you know these people, have shared a beer with them in Merlotte's and gone to Bon Temps football games with them.      What really stands out - and is also a major theme of the books - is the grey area that exists between good and evil, an area shared by humans, vamps, shapeshifters, and everyone else.  Vampires are not evil, humans are not good.  They all show elements of light and dark through their actions, emotions, and relationships.  The complexities of these interactions bring a richness to the show that make it stand out from much of the drama on TV these days.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody Gardot is an incredible vocalist and this CD is just amazingly good. No matter what your musical preference if you appreciate vocal artistry you will love Melody Gardot!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Again, this review is not about the movie, which is 5 stars all the way.  I have a Sony Bravia 1080p with HDMI and was excited to see the difference from the normal DVD.  Sadly, there is practially NO difference.  I actually popped in the orignal DVD just to make sure.  The ONLY thing it has is an extended director's cut.  If you already have the regular DVD then this is a complete waste of money.
0739383248|5.0|Imagine being uptight and wanting to analyze everything to the point of nausium. You have your routine and life is what you think it should be. Enter the ghost of your great aunt who was a fun, live for today flapper in the twenties. Life to her is a party and her goal is to find the next one and dance, dance, dance.    This was a very fun book to listen to. I wanted it to go on and on. We laughed out lied and cried. I could see it as a movie.
0380977273|5.0|This is hands down in my opinion Bradburys best novel and my favorite story his. Who knows how many stories he has published for the last 60 years and this one I hold dear to me. I have always been a huge fan of his, especially his short stories. If you want to check out a gerat book by this famous author I could only highly recomend Something Wicked This Way Comes!
0307269981|5.0|Now I say this tentatively, but I do believe this book is better than the first.  There is more action, more suspense, and more intellectual scenarios.  I loved the first book, and gave it a 5 out of 5, and this book did not fail to impress me as much as I'd hoped.  If you enjoyed the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I strongly recommend reading this book.
0439023491|5.0|I just finished reading book 2. As I did when I got to the end of the first book I screamed NO! I need to know what happens next and I don't want to wait months to find out.<br /><br />Book 2 \\"Catching Fire\\" is just as page turning, chapter after chapter, can't put the book down as the first book \\"The Hunger Games\\" was. If you haven't read either you need to read the Hunger Games first.<br /><br />What was started in the first book only escalates into the second, you'd never think a 16-year-old girl could cause so much trouble intentionally or not.<br /><br />This book is clean, no fowl language, no graphic sex, as in the first book there is some violence (mostly involved with the games). I let my 12-year-old read this book. I would highly recommend this book to everyone, well maybe 12 and up.

Never thought anybody else could do Beatle songs but the Beatles...I was wrong.I lived through the 60's. I saw the Beatles in San Diego and in LA, but as a 13yr old. This story taught me a lot more than I thought I knew about it all.Watching the bonus DVD showing the way Julie Taymor created the magic was so much fun. I could see how important it all was to her.If you don't cry the watching the woman sing \\"Let It Be\\" then you ain't human!    Enjoy.

1592402690|5.0|Every since the Beatles formed we have been inundated by Beatles books, some informative, some not so much.  The first thing that sets this book from most every other Beatles book is that it is not a book on their lives.  It is on the recording of the Beatles from their very begining to their last session--and even to the 1995 Anthology.  Not that there isn't a lot of history to be told.  This book is Geoff Emerick's life story and is from his point of view.  He is quite biased at times, he doesn't hold back letting you know that Paul is his favorite Beatle--and is not afraid to tell you that Goerge Martin could be manipulative at times.  But this does not discourage the reader into thinking this is just a tell-all book.  It is not.  Mr. Emerick is not overly judgmental.  He actually has great respect for most of the people he chastises--he is just brutally honest.      Like any Beatles book there are many anecdotes that are well know, at least by Beatles aficionados, but there are many that most will not be familiar with.  Even the ones that are know are told from a different persective.  I, being a self-proclaimed Bealtes expert, learned some stories I had never heard.  But again, this is a technical book.  This book is by no means a rechauffe of Mark Lewisson's THE COMPLETE BEATLES RECORDING SESSIONS although there are some retellings of stories.  Lewisson's book is more of a diary; Emericks is a collection of studio stories.      Even for a technical book, this book will not be over anyone's heads.  If one even knows the rudimental basics of recording, you will understand.  At points in the narrative if Mr. Emerick even remotely thinks that he is being too techinical, he will explain it in a sentence or two.  He doesn't really brag about his abilities either. He will tell you how important the engineer's job is and is pointed that the Beatles could not have been successful without an engineer.  He does, however, give them all the credit for writing and performing the songs.  He never takes away the fact the Beatles were true geniuses.  The same goes for George Martin.    This book is a great read.  I encorage any Beatles fan to buy it.  A SPLENDID TIME IS GUARANTEED.
0679805273|5.0|This is a book that can be enjoyed by both young and old alike! I purchased it as part of a graduation gift for my sister-in-law since it refers to life in general.  A girlfriend had purchased it as a gift for my one year old son!<br /><br />Love it!
B002DESIE6|5.0|I've had this on constant replay for the last couple days and am now on about my 12th listen, and I'm still captivated.  This is one of the most impressive albums that I've heard in some time.  Imagine 17 Seconds era Cure with Elizabeth Fraser from the Cocteau Twins sharing lead vocals, produced by Timbaland.  That's the starting point for this bewitching set of tunes.  From the opening INTRO through to the closing STARS, every song is a highlight and flows perfectly into the next one.  Languid guitars, spare beats and casual, conversational tag team male-female vocals created a dreamlike sound with plenty of space and emotion.  I'm cueing it up for another listen.  Very highly recommended.

B001C3KCSY|1.0|I like to think my musical tastes are pretty diverse, and sophisticated.  I like GOOD music, whether it be gospel, jazz, country, rock, pop, techno, whatever.  With that said, I was introduced by a friend to this Kings of Leon album.  Having a Zune pass, I was able to put the entire album to my Zune for free, and listened right away.  I got through the album, and I was honestly left shrugging in disbelief.  I heard RAVE reviews about this album, and honestly, I just don't get it.  I don't get what I'm supposedly missing.  This album offers little to nothing in the way of anything that interests or captivates me.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the lead singers voice.  I was told, \\"it takes some getting used to\\", but after numerous listens, I still think he's a terrible vocalist, and I find his voice more irritating than anything else.<br /><br />I tried to like this album.... even listened several times, when it initially made a horrific impression on me.  But alas, I just truly think this album is trash, despite the rave reviews and the critical acclaim.  It leaves me thinking, \\"What am I missing???\\"
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are the best headphones I've ever heard. It produces booming bass, and a great treble response. Couldn't be happier. The only minor caveat is my ears start hurting (from the pressing of the earpiece) after prolonged use. But the good thing is that it can be used as a DJ style monitor with just one ear piece folded back. Great value for money.
0694003611|5.0|This book is wonderful. I started reading it to my daughter when she was a baby at bed time, and even though she's 5 now she still pulls it out of the bookshelf at least once a week as part of her nightly reading ritual.<br /><br />The reason why this book is so beloved by both children and parents is that it helps get them ready for the ritual of going to bed, relaxing their minds and bodies. Who amoung us as parents haven't had our children say good night to everyone and everything, inanimate objects included. The boy in the story as he's going to bed an getting ready to sleep says goodnight to everything he sees in his room and when he is finished he knows that it is time to sleep. When reading this story to your child slowly soften your voice as you turn the pages until you are just whispering at the end. Have your child try to find the mouse on each of the colored pages and say goodnight to some of the objects in their room as they lay down for the night.<br /><br />It seems the majority of bad reviews for this book are based on the idea that it is not colorful enough or an exciting read. That's sort of the idea. Little eyes and minds get enough stimulation during the day and a lot of it isn't positive or good. This book helps children notice the small details of their surroundings, to use their imagination, all in the process of going to bed.<br /><br />This is one of the best, if not the best, night time book out there and I would highly recommend to parents with small children.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I was so excited to get my  supernatural season 4 box set. I moved in the middle of every thing and it was delivered on the 2nd instead of the first but I called the customer service and the customer service rep was so helpful. She took care of everything and even took off my shipping fees due to a mistake that wasn't even Amazon's fault. It was delivered the next day and needless to say as always I am very happy with the service I receive with Amazon.com and I am loving getting to re watch the best television show ever produced. I am the biggest fan girl in the universe and This show is always the biggest topic of discussion for me and my friends and family. They really outdid themselves with the extras I loved the mythology extras they were really cool. As always the gag reel was hilarious and I liked how they showed alot of behind the scenes. I highly recommend this dvd.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I'm really enjoying this album.  Album kicks off with ultra-catchy \\"Million Dollar Bill\\".  The multi-layered vocals on the chorus of \\"Nothin' But Love\\" are fantastic.  \\"Call You Tonight\\" is to Whitney's album what \\"Spotlight\\" is to Jennifer Hudson's rhythm-wise (not sure if they're the same production team).  \\"I Look to You\\" really is the centerpiece of the album.  I think many expected a bombastic ballad but the understatement and restraint is quite lovely and effective and yet it still has dynamic highs and lows.  I usually prefer up-tempo to down but I must repeat this is a great ballad.  Similarly, I'm not a duet person either but the duet with Akon on \\"Like I Never Left\\" is amazing.  Their voices really mesh and the song is great.  I like the slow start of \\"A Song for You\\" but didn't care for it much at all when it kicked into high gear...not a bad track...I just wasn't feeling it (once again, surprising, as I'm really into the dance tunes).  \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" is certainly a Whitney ballad.  Not quite up to \\"I Look To You\\" but single-worthy...and once again not bombastic but effective.  \\"Worth It\\" is very up-to-the-moment urban and has great synthesizer breaks in the arrangement and Whitney carries it off really well.  \\"I Got You\\" has a bass heavy production and sounds very contemporary and current as well as farmiliar all at the same time.  \\"Salute\\" has a good sound but not a favorite of mine.<br />One thing I must add is that A LOT is being made of the new Whitney's husky voice and I still hear A LOT of the Whitney voice, talent and style of prior days.  It may be an odd comparison but if you take a singer like Judy Garland, her latter day recordings were very different sounding from her earliest to her M-G-M ones to her Capitol days and  60's television show recordings and yet you always heard the essence of Judy in them and that always made them enjoyable to fans.  With this album you get MORE than just the essence of Whitney and just a little bit of a notion that it's a different phase in her recording career.  \\"I Look To You\\" is quite a satisfying album to me.  And, by the way, the album cover rocks but the booklet pics are even better...I like the smiling, stylish Whitney pics inside!of a notion that it's a different phase in her recording career.  \\"I Look To You\\" is quite a satisfying album to me.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I looked all over the internet for xbox 360 gaming headsets, for a month I read reviews and opinions and i finally was at the choice of either the  TB x4's or the astro a40's. I had decided to buy the a40's but when I went to order them they wanted another $50 to ship to hawaii (astro sucks to ship to Hawaii). Man I was miffed, so i was gonna have to save a little longer to get my gaming headset when low and behold, the tb x41's came up on amazon as a pre-order. I ordered them right away( and saved a few dollars over the a40's), and now that i've used them i can say that i love them, the sound is excellent and i can finally hear my friends on live. I'm no expert, but i will say that these are worth the price (if you got it), and have exceded my expectations.
B00007BKVC|5.0|A classic of nevermore-to-be-thwarted femininity<br /><br />I have been hearing cultural references to this film for years, and finally broke down to see it. I thought that it would be a silly female version of the buddy/road film. But I was mistaken. Eighteen years after its release, \\"Thelma and Louise\\" is still a powerful and comic indictment of the swinish side of the American male. Just about every guy in the T&L is a boor -- the loutish, self-centered husband, the non-committing, violence-prone boyfriend, the predatory rape-ready good ol' boy, the betraying hustler, the disrespectful, disgusting trucker and male-dominated law enforcement. Every stereotype of the underbelly of US masculinity is on parade and is deliciously dispatched by the unlikely heroines of the film. Thelma and Louise represent femininity looking for a little respect and freedom, and finding none, blazing a pushback trail through the American Southwest. T&L is very well acted (Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Harvey Keitel and Christopher MacDonald are standouts), fabulously written, and believable. In spite of the serious subject matter, the film is uplifting and often hilarious. A winner.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|I had not seen \\"Cabaret\\" since it first came out, and so I wondered how it would survive after all this time. I need not have worried. It is a classic, with some truly shattering performances. Joel Grey is amazing as this kind of ambivalent court jester who comments on history, sociology and human foibles by his presentations in the Kit Kat Club. It is at the same time witty,decadent and horrific.It is one of those performances which one remembers through one's life, as is Liza Minelli's. If ever an Oscar was deserved it was this one. Ms Minelli manages to create in her rendering of Sally Bowles an image of the thirties and at the same time producing a person of depth with an underlying tragedy who gains our complete sympathy while we deplore her life style.It is a beautiful performance. I think if I was to produce a \\"must see\\" shortlist \\"Cabaret\\" would be right in there.Bob Fosse directed some wonderful, if disturbing , works of great power.

B002EA4IO8|5.0|A poignant story of innocence and brutality. Of naivete on the part of Bruno who, unbeknownst to him, would be swept up by that naivete. He had no understanding of what went on on the other side of the fence.     Bruno is 9 years old when, against his will, his family moves from their spacious home in Berlin, to Poland where he now lives across the street from a prison camp. Only he doesn't know it's a prison camp. This house is much smaller and nowhere near as nice as the one he came from. There is no one for him to play with and not much for him to do. In Berlin, he had three very good friends. Now he doesn't see them anymore.     Other folks are now to call his father Commandant. Bruno is very unhappy about the move. His sister Gretel is 12 years old and flirting with a teenage soldier. Bruno goes out exploring one day around the fence he is able to see from his yard. After walking for quite some time, he meets and befriends a boy on the other side of the fence who is the same age as he. This boy's name is Shmuel. Bruno has trouble understanding why Shmuel is sad. Why he doesn't like the soldiers. Bruno doesn't know which symbol he'd rather wear, a swastika or the star the boy was forced to wear.     Bruno imagines happy families on the other side of the fence -- families who gather about talking about old times and playing games. As Bruno meets with his new friend, he complains about no longer having 5 floors in his new home but only three, all the while being totally clueless as to the truth behind the fence.     He asks Gretel about the fence and about the people on the other side. Who are they? Jews. \\"Are we Jews,\\" he asks. She can't think how to respond when he asks her if Bruno and his family are not Jews then what are they. She stumbles over that question and the best she can come up with is \\"the opposite of Jews.\\" She tells them that the Opposite don't like Jews.     I was disappointed that no explanation was forthcoming regarding Pavel's previous position.  The reader is left to guess at that as well as to what the Lieutenant did/said to Pavel and what became of both of them.

B00009ZYBY|3.0|There are technical flaws, covered extensively by other Amazon reviewers, in this film contributing to its mediocrity - over reliance on computer generated  backgrounds/special effects; too many scenes filmed in dim or blue light; excitement punctuated with too long boredom. However, there are deeper and more fundamental flaws; some which ought to cause grave concern:<br /><br />1.) Why was this mediocre film so widely acclaimed? Perhaps it was the spectacle of Coliseum violence, violence that is one step beyond the spectacle of NFL football; violence people in American society are hankering for. Hankering for because as Americans fail to see the larger problems of society go unresolved, they long to see resolution achieved in other venues - games, contests -; resolution that allows them to imagine the violent, painful and bloody end of their enemies (for example, a liberal imaging the death of a conservative, and visa versa). The success of this film is an evil portent for where our culture may be headed.<br /><br />2.) Everyone should be troubled that while Hollywood finds it almost impossible to cast in the mold of a hero anyone with Christian faith, Russell Crowe in this role is depicted as a man of worth because of his faith in the gods worshipped in Rome. His strong faith in these gods is depicted as a stabilizing and grounding influence in his life, over and against his semi-crazed Emperor-antagonist. Faith also allows Crowe's character to endure the cruel treatment of his family and to hope and believe he will be rejoined in an afterlife with lost loved ones.  In light of who the Roman gods actually were, was Crowe's character's faith reasonable, or worthy of admiration? By what mechanism do the gods of Rome provide justice in an afterlife? For example, Crowe's character is sure his loved ones will go to a heavenly afterlife, partly because they were a target of evil, but the movie begins with Crowe butchering thousands of Germanic tribesmen - presumably with families themselves - which Crowe's character, and Rome, is invading as imperialist conquerors. Why is not Crowe's character \\"evil\\" for a lifetime of butchery as a Roman general? If Hollywood is going to cast out Christian heroes (Ben-Hur) and credibly substitute with Roman conquerors? Does no one find this incredible?elves - which Crowe's character, and Rome, is invading as imperialist conquerors.

0307408833|5.0|I've been to Babycakes in NYC in the last month....and these aren't the same recipes.  So I would like to make a couple of suggestions.<br /><br />If you are going to use a baking mix, use Whole Foods All-Purpose Baking mix, and then cut it with at least 1/3 Kinnikinnick millet flour.  The reasons for doing that are threefold:<br /><br />1.)  Truly gluten-free.  Bob's Red Mill is not.<br /><br />2.)  No bean flours.  (Nasty, and that's not what's in Babycakes' fabulous, non-beany cookies, or at least not in the amounts Bob's Red Mill uses.)<br /><br />3.)  Millet is really good for baking--and I'm sure that's what they use, because I was eating one of their frozen cookie sandwiches on the way to Coney Island;  at about the Brighton Beach stop, I was suddenly chewing on a millet seed.<br /><br />Also, this is probably the recipe for the mint icing used as the Babycakes gluten-free cookie sandwich filling--it tastes like vaguely like coconut.<br /><br />Coconut butter (Mine got melty on the subway in 90 degree weather.)<br />Mint essential oil (Extract is nasty.  Thanks to Posh and Becks' recipe for gf Girl Scout Thin Mints for that information.)<br />Agave Nectar (No sugar rush from anything other than the Coney Island Cyclone)<br />Cocoa Butter (There is a vaguely chocolatey taste in there.)<br />Green food dye (They are green.)<br /><br />Babycakes is a fantastic bakery.  I'm just not sure their cookbook is worth picking up, unless you're willing to tinker with the recipes.

B0021L8US0|5.0|I cannot name another film requiring special effects that does not make gratuitous superfluous overuse of them.  Mr. Bloemkamp is the careful kind of writer/director who's dual role keeps himself in check.  This is not Peter Jackson fantasy, though the main prawn sports his last name.  Jackson's folks at WETA have done a splendid job of transitioning from Tolkien-land to hyper-realism.  The use of the Red One Camera is a brilliant choice for capturing this action.  More people walked out than I have seen since Pulp Fiction.  But not for gore, for \\"a little too-good\\" realism.<br /><br />The story is set in Joburg, Soweto and environs with apartheid rhyming loudly.  The slums, shacks and carcasses are all real.  District 9 itself is real, newly evacuated just before filming began.  Mr. Bloemkamp's genius balancing of the public point of view for the camera as a sort of news and documentary approach with the behind the scenes look into the prawn ghetto is greatly difficult made to look easy.  One way he deftly manages this complex approach is the bright idea of having separate units for documentary and interviews, keeping their own integrity from being lost in the big picture.<br /><br />The story line has a simple enough outline.  An ship of aliens, given the name \\"prawns\\" in the best traditions of racism made intergalactic, arrived for unknown reasons a score years ago.  The inhabitants, seeming sickly and without organization, are moved to a Joburg hell hole.  The dicey situation has been under the management of a combination of Cheney's Haliburton and his buddies at Blackwater, but more disciplined, competent and empathetic.  There is the more honestly criminal presence of the Nigerian Racketeers, who remind me of the ones we have been dealing with for decades in global fraud rings as seen in credit card applications, and mail/email scams of the familiar \\"We have need for you to take our deposit of $10 million...\\"  They have all been state sponsored for generations.  Here, they are the local purveyors of meat.  Prawns have a taste for canned cat food, which is reminiscent of a sadder but more real scene I see every week in the supermarkets as the poor, especially the elderly poor buy cat food cans for table use.<br /><br />The central figure is a prototypical corporate shlub cum aparatchik, Wilkus.  He is straight out of Dilbert and other corporate functionary nightmares.  This is his journey.  He bullies his way in and battles out.  He encounters things that would stop even the Swedish Home Guard.  He slogs through games of base skull.  Mr. Copley is a brilliant actor in this difficult role.<br /><br />Anymore would begin to give away more of the film than should be.  The City of Prague Orchestra does a fine job with the score, especially in contrast with the lonely solo voice of the slums.  Interestingly Mr. Jackson's uses the improbable name Wingnut Productions for his company.  This film is strong medicine, but of high value and never cheap.

1400063515|1.0|The best I can say is do yourself a favor and read all that has been eloquently stated in the one star reviews.  This book is a rambling, arrogant, piece of trash.  It was the only book I brought on a month-long Arctic expedition and I eventually burned it rather than have carry it one step further.
B000VD9MG4|5.0|Frankenstein and the Wolfman terrified audiences in their time. Half a century after is very different. Buckets of blood later has a clever, well done Hostel; which restrains itself in the most horrible; the horror that man does to man. Almost Neo-Noir Horror as the horny kids fall into a Holiday Hell, Euro style. The best of this type of film; Roth is fantastic : the photography and actors are real characters and have you along for the ride. Rough; but so was the Exorcist. A/V tops, Loud shaker, great widescreen, sound and photography. Rated NF (not for a lot of people)

068484267X|4.0|4.0 out of 5 stars Survival Instincts, Sep 4 2009  By Ethel Clark - See all my reviews     This is my first read of Frank McCourt's boyhood memories,prompted by his recent passing. It made me wonder why this award-winning gem never entered my hands before now.    Frank's story begins in New York and moves to Limerick, Ireland in a short time-span and ends on a positive note when Frank, now grown, moves back in search of a better life. The narrator makes everyday language appear as though the reader shares the pain, poverty, sadness, survival and death. The joyful moments are far and few between as the family suffers the consequences of their father's selfish ways in his alcoholic haze, drinking his pay check, week after week, causing their mother to seek and beg for a mere pittance of food for her hungry children. The power of love prevails all of life's heartbreaks as this family joins together in one crisis after another.    It's unique because this one man's story in a fight for survival couldn't possibly be duplicated with as much humour as Frank McCourt weaved into it. He turned a life of heartbreak into a joy for the reader and I recommend it for centuries to come. It has inspired me to search for the sequel called 'Tis.

B0017ZB8M6|3.0|Katy Perry came on to the music scene with an in-your-face attitude about bi-curiosity with her hit song, \\"I Kissed a Girl\\".  Unfortunately, radio is ringing out her album with both hands, trying to squeeze as much as they can out of her singles so that if you started out mildly enjoying her music, you despise it by month's end.<br /><br />However, if you are lucky enough to avoid radio and you enjoy bubblegum pop, then you've come to the right place.  Perry's album touches on many different subjects, from spending the night in Vegas to kissing girls to calling her ex gay.  Perry ventures into territory that is normally considered taboo and for that she deserves merit.  She's daring and flirty without being too over the top.  She's stylish without looking slutty, and her music is quite easy to envision being the soundtrack to many an upcoming film in the future.<br /><br />Below is a brief description of each track on the album and a numerical rating for each track.  See if you agree.  If you need to pick up a copy of this album, be forewarned.  It is highly likely that you could end up getting an edited copy of \\"Ur So Gay\\" without even realizing it, since there is no parental advisory sticker or anything else to warn you of the difference.  If you are into edited songs, then go right ahead.  But if you prefer uncensored, you may want to acquire this song off of iTunes or another legal download service that offers the uncensored version.<br /><br />Track 1: One of the Boys--(5)--a cutesie song to start off with, Perry is a tomboy but realizes the boys will never love her in the way she needs them to, they'll just consider her a buddy.  She wants to shed the buddy image and grow into her own as a woman.<br /><br />Track 2: I Kissed a Girl--(9)--the song that made Perry a household name.  It rocks, it flirts and best of all, it brings a topic to the surface that most consider taboo and says basically, yeah, I did it, so what?  Not a big deal.  It makes being bad so much fun, even though it's not really being bad in the first place.<br /><br />Track 3: Waking Up in Vegas--(8)--another big single for Perry with a catchy chorus and some amusing lyrics about how crazy life can get when you're spending the night in Vegas.  So you're broke and covered in glitter.  What'd you expect?  You're in Vegas, baby!<br /><br />Track 4: Thinking of You--(6)--the first ballad on the album, Perry is with someone else now but is thinking of the one that got away the whole time, regretting how things happened and wishing she could change the past and make him part of her present once again.<br /><br />Track 5: Mannequin--(7)--a creative song about having a relationship with a man who shows absolutely no emotion whatsoever.<br /><br />Track 6: Ur So Gay--(7)--a tongue-in-cheek break-up song where Perry calls out many different ways in which her ex sucks.  She hopes he hangs himself with his H&M scarf.  He's too skinny, he'd rather be on Myspace than spend time with her, and he has a small penis.  Anyone who's ever been wronged by their man can sing along with this tune with an evil smirk on their face.<br /><br />Track 7: Hot 'n' Cold--(8)--another radio-friendly single, this very catchy track examines an ambivalent relationship where they just can't make up their minds.  They fight and break up.  They kiss and make up.  They've \\"got a case of love bi-polar.\\"<br /><br />Track 8: If You Can Afford Me--(7)--a song that closely resembles an 80's rock-type track, Perry exudes the important message that girls should have the self-respect to hold out for a man who truly deserves her.  She's not a piece of ass and she can be bought, but you'd better be able to afford her because she doesn't come cheap, and she doesn't mean monetarily.<br /><br />Track 9: Lost--(5)--a song about feeling lost, in despair and ultimately alone, it could quite possibly be an outlet for Perry trying to deal with her newfound fame.<br /><br />Track 10: Self-Inflicted--(5)--a filler song, Perry excuses all of the scars and pain she is enduring because he is the weapon she chooses.  Her wounds are self-inflicted and she's fine with that.<br /><br />Track 11: I'm Still Breathing--(6)--another ballad on the album, here Perry realizes she is in a doomed relationship.  She's pulling the plug and is willing to give him one last chance to say something, as long as he doesn't tell her he loves her.<br /><br />Track 12: Fingerprints--(5)--she won't be unimportant, she is going to stand up and fight for her chance to leave a mark, be important--she'll leave her fingerprints on you.<br /><br />Overall album rating: 6.5hooses.

B001CDLATE|4.0|not a bad movie, just not great.  i learned a lot about colorful endogenous peoples in remote regions contrasted with megacity dwellers.  i purchased this because of the reviews saying this was one of the best movies if not the best on blu ray.  i am however totally spoiled by planet earth (both reg dvd and blu ray).  i kept wanting/waiting for the panoramic aerial views as in planet earth but the majestic scenes were limited.  the music and flow were not as polished as in planet earth. i can only assume the reviews were from before the release of planet earth. it seemed choppy and a mixed bag of some stellar shots mixed with mediocre ones. i can't even remember what the movie's theme was.
B000DWMYQ8|1.0|Yesterday I took a huge dump. Then I looked at it for 81 minutes. It was 1000 times better than this movie. My nephew was watching it and it was so bad he threw up. Aliens? Zach Braff? That terrible baseball scene where Little hits a homerun and those boners are scurrying around the outfield. What? Please, my 2 year old said, \\"Daddy, this movie blows. Why did you do this to me? Do you not love me?\\" I was like, \\"Dude, I'm sorry. Can you ever forgive me?\\"<br /><br />I heard Mickey Mouse started drinking heavily after he watched this monstrosity and he hasn't been seen since. I'm going to eat chicken for every meal for the rest of my life just because this movie was that bad. Next time I see a dam chicken clucking around like he owns the joint I'ma boot em right up his ahhhhhhss.
B0019LY5I2|1.0|\\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" (such a contemptible title, but more on that later) is the newest film perpetrated on the public by Stephen Sommers. Sommers' first big hit, \\"The Mummy\\" was a fun, but loud throwback to the horror films of the 30s only using special effects from the new century. Since then, he has made a series of sequels and other films that only proceed to get louder and more obnoxious.<br /><br />With \\"G.I. Joe\\", the noise, bad sound effects and even worse acting reaches a new level. In short, I will not be going to any more films directed by Steohen Sommers, unless they have enormously good buzz.<br /><br />I was actually more than a little shocked by how bad this new film is.<br /><br />The acting is terrible; even Dennis Quaid, who plays General Hawk, in charge of a special brigade called \\"G.I. Joe\\", is usually able to surprise me with his ability to make a film work. In \\"Joe\\", he looks like he is passing a kidney stone in every scene. Really. He pops up with an incredibly pained expression on his face and barks out his lines like he is trying to get back to the bathroom for another try. Channing Tatum plays Duke, the 'handsome, courageous lead' necessary in such a film. I have never seen Tatum in any other films as a lead, but if \\"Joe\\" is any indication, the guy is being cast for his looks. He can't act. There are a few moments when he is trying to flirt with his old girlfriend and they come across like a high school kid trying to taunt the girl he is secretly interested in. Christopher Eccleston (a once promising British actor who most recently played the Ninth \\"Doctor Who\\") Adewale  Akinnuoye-Agbaje (most recently on TV's \\"Lost\\"), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (\\"(500) Days of Summer\\") and many others play various characters, heroes and villains, sometimes changing halfway through the film. But it is difficult to tell who is who because the film is soo loud and makes little sense. You get to the point that you really don't care what is going on. Or who is responsible.<br /><br />It really is inconceivable to me why some of the actors are involved in this film. The plot concerns the theft of a new bioweapon developed by Christopher Eccleston's company. Tatum and Marlon Wayans (What the F?) are two soldiers hired to protect the shipment. Soon, they are under attack (in what appears to be a field covered with Astroturf and fake trees) and trying to fend off the baddies. When they start to lose ground, the G.I. Joe brigade shows up to lend a hand. And Tatum keeps saying, \\"I want in\\". Finally, they let him and Wayans in.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose other film this summer is the far more impressive \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" plays some sort of doctor. He may be a villain but it is difficult to tell because nothing is extremely clear in this film. Throughout, he wears a Hannibal Lecter-like mask obscuring the bottom of his face and speaks with a voice that seems to mimic the villains in the \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\\" television show. When you start paying homage to a kids show that is generally recognized as one of the worst ever created, something is wrong with your character. More importantly, something is wrong with the film.<br /><br />Finally, they show up at G.I. Joe headquarters and get a tour of all of the special effects direct Sommers has at his disposal. Shockingly, they are really pretty unrealistic looking. Maybe this is due to the shear volume of special effects. At one point, a plane flies into view and the character in the cockpit looks like bad special effects. This continues throughout. I think the key problem is that because there are so many special effects, the entire look of the film becomes flat and 2-D. Everything looks painted and poorly executed.<br /><br />So, back to the title. The film is called \\"G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\". It isn't just called \\"G.I. Joe\\". The title and the film have been set-up to be sequel ready. They are already anticipating making more than one film. This means they expect the film to be a huge hit. Why is that? Because it is filled with special effects, good looking models and a fantastical story? It is for these very reasons there should never be another \\"G.I. Joe\\" film. Given the fact the film made a tremendous amount of money during the opening weekend, I think we are due for at least one sequel. Given the negative buzz for the first film, perhaps we will only be subjected to one sequel. Let's hope. And pray that the powers that be can hear our pleas over the din of this film.Because it is filled with special effects, good looking models and a fantastical story?

B002436WFI|3.0|As a hearing impaired person, I need closed captioning to help me with the dialouge, especially accented dialouge. I was extrememly disappointed to find there was no closed captioning on this disc. Now, before you all tell me I should have read the specs first, The Hogfather has closed captioning even though that is not mentions in its specs. I thought all TV shows (and this film was made for Sky-TV) were required to have closed captions, but maybe that's only in the US.     I am really sorry I can't hear the humorous dialouge I experienced when reading the book. (Sigh)
0061134007|4.0|\\"Redbreast\\" is a complex, very well written crime novel, although the characters are not as nuanced as in a good literary work.  It would have helped me to know from the beginning that the accounts of WWII were supposed to be someone's memoirs; also, the \\"GBH\\" abbreviation stands for grievous bodily harm.  From brief research on the Internet I gleaned that symptoms of   multiple personality disorder  can \\"vary over time\\" (this is important to the plot).     The novel perhaps paints too negative a picture of Norwegians under the Nazi occupation.  In particular, the resistance helped half of the small Jewish community escape to Sweden ([...]).

B00194W6V2|5.0|This novel is one of the many examples of why books are better than movies. I've only read one exception to that rule, and that's Forrest Gump (goodness, that book was terrible!!!). I watched the movie before I picked up the book, and though the movie was cute and adorable in a romantic comedy/Hollywood sort of way, the book is much more detailed and whole and realistic.<br /><br />Holly is a great, true-to-life character. The reader is with her through every emotion that she has, and what a roller-coaster of emotions! Which makes sense, considering she just lost the love of her life and her soul mate. Chapter by chapter, month by month, she picks up the pieces of her life and puts herself back together, and you're with her every step of the way. And I don't just mean physically, but emotionally, also. I felt for Holly. There were times when tears almost slipped down my cheeks.<br /><br />This is not your typical chicklit. It is a story about a girl, going through tough times and then finding herself at the end. Which is a concept usually associated with chicklit. But usually the girl falls in love with a handsome, witty man. This book, PS, I Love You, is more than that. It's a girl learning to love herself and coping with life after it almost destroys her. This story is definitely a unique representation of tragedy and personal reconstruction.<br /><br />It is light reading; I read it quickly mostly because I didn't want to put it down! The language flows smoothly and succinctly. Holly's family and friends were characters that were funny and sympathetic, crazy and adoring. They were the foundation of the book, and the support system for Holly's character; she would not have been so successful if it weren't for them.<br /><br />Go ahead, watch the movie. But I recommend reading the book, too. You will learn more about the characters and delve into more detail about love, life, and finding personal happiness.

B001XJEKGC|5.0|This is a great DVD, especially if you were lucky enough to see Clapton and Winwood this summer. Seen them in Columbus, Ohio and this DVD is a good reminder of how great of a show that was. Pretty much the same set list as Columbus, this DVD has excellent sound and camera work. If you are a Blind Faith, Traffic, Derek and the Dominos fan this is a must buy for you.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Whitney Houston's I Look to You is an example of Clive Davis' genius and his connection with today's music and with the baby girl diva he introduced to the world in 1985. The mark of a great album is when each song can stand on its own merit. Long gone are the days of having continuity on albums, especially with the advent of downloading individual songs.  I'm not usually a fan of multiple producers, but in this case, and in keeping with the times, Davis selected the perfect blend of stellar musical talent to produce Houston's collection of singles in her first studio album in seven years.  It's a formula that works.    Some highlights include the album's first song, the Alicia Keys-penned and Swizz Beatz-produced \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" a tune that is a throw back to some early house music grooves.  Danja, a Grammy winning producer and composer who has worked with Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Mariah Carey, produced \\"Nothin' But Love\\" a shout out to Houston's supporters as well as her detractors, and \\"For the Lovers,\\" a bouncing, electronica type dance tune that makes your body move and that has endless remix possibilities, a sure fire club/dance hit. One of my favorite songs is the mid-tempo, R&B tune \\"Worth It' produced by Eric Hudson (producer of songs by Brandy, Trey Songz, Mary J. Blige, and Kanye West).    Notably is the change in her voice, which she uses to her advantage.  Gone are the long, sustained and soaring vocal runs and aerobatic fills that infused her previous hits and in their place are a deeper, richer sound that allow her to flow with and inside the groove on the up-tempo songs. Still present, however, is the emotion and her interpretive skills on the album's title track, written by R. Kelly, and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength,\\" (written by Diane Warren and produced by David Foster) both songs a testimony of her spiritual growth.    I Look to You may or may not be one of Houston's biggest selling albums, but there is no doubt that itwill remain on the charts for a few years. Yes, a few years.  Davis and Houston could choose to release as many singles as they want, and each one would be a guaranteed top 10 hit not to mention be in the running for a Grammy, which this album will get next year. This album successfully places Houston back in the game, like she never left.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|This movie is absolutely terrible.  Do not waist two hours of your life watching this film.  Poor sub-titles, no action, and a little perverted, too.  I'd rather sit in a doctor's waiting room than to have watched this movie.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|Ok, the voice is not fully recovered yet. It still needs work. But then, she sounds much better than she did some years ago when her voice was literally GONE. The problem, as some other reviewers stated, lies in the song selection rather than in her vocal abilities. As a musician I've worked with people who had \\"lost their voice\\" too and I think that you can disguise the vocal problems if you choose the right material. The songs are not ugly, but they're not pretty either. They're simply forgettable. Still, I think she's improving and thus it wouldn't be fair to say that \\"she's through\\". I think she's starting over, and that should be acknowledged. Good for her :-)
B00151G0CK|5.0|This is a great collection of Darkness tunes. This CD is everything you could get minus the b-sides which are awesome (in some cases better than the album tracks.)
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I Look To You is a really good album and a welcome return for Whitney Houston. For two years in the making, this album had better been good right? Well Whitney certainly does deliver particularly on the first(second)single, \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" co-written by Alicia Keys and produced by Swizz Beats. The song has a bouncy, 70s disco feel that is very fun and enjoyable. My personal favorite song on the album is \\"Nothin But Love\\" which is a kiss off to many of Whitney's haters and skeptics over the year. \\"Call You Tonight\\" is a Johnta Austin composition which the singer originally recorded for his never released, \\"Ocean Drive\\" album. Whitney does a good job with the song but I actually think Johnta's version is slightly better.<br /><br />\\"I Look To You\\" is decent, kinda bland and boring. \\"Worth It\\" is one of other favorite songs. \\"For The Lovers\\" is bouncy and spunky. \\"A Song For You\\" is cool. \\"I Didn't Know..\\" is just alright. \\"Like I Never Left\\" featuring Akon is another favorite of mine. \\"I Got You\\" starts off really nice but kinda loses steam.<br /><br />All in all Whitney put together a really good album and of course not many albums are completely perfect and could do with or without some songs or other gripes we consumers have.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|This is nothing but corny soft porn with a vampire sub plot. I was going to stop after one episode but I watched the first four and then I gave up. You can't go 5 minutes without a sex scene, or at least some mention of sex. It's really too much, and honestly it made me uncomfortable to watch it. The sexual aspect aside, it was very difficult for me to even get into the plot of the show. The actors are horrible and I found myself laughing at what is probably supposed to be serious. After 4 episodes I found that I had absolutely no interest in what was going to happen next.

0307341569|5.0|Very good book!  I received it in the mail from Amazon and it was promptly borrowed by my little brother.  It's taken months to get the book back so I could read it.  Clearly, this book is good enough to be steal-worthy :)    The story centers around Libby Day, who lost her family to a violent massacre when she was a child.  Her brother is jailed for their death, and Libby's testimony is the key evidence.    After a number of years, Libby decides to revisit her memories of that terrible day with a group of true crime enthusiasts who dub themselves the \\"Kill Club\\".  They believe her brother was wrongly convicted.  Libby still believes her brother is guilty, but she decides to help them.

044024367X|2.0|I really WANTED to love this book--I'm a huge Jack Reacher fan--but I just couldn't help feeling disappointed.      Books like \\"Persuader\\" and \\"The Killing Floor\\" were so raw and suspenseful, I literally lost sleep staying up and reading them.  With \\"Nothing to Lose,\\" I lost no sleep at all; in fact at times, I felt like yawning.      It's almost like Lee Child is doing a paint-by-numbers routine with this book: Reacher gets curious about something that seems a little off and that later turns into a big conspiracy; there's a love interest; something about patriotic duty; and some serious ass kicking.  Granted those are typical elements in Reacher stories, but this time Child fails to infuse them with his usual energy and verve and they just seem tired.     If you are new to the series, don't start with this book or you might not go back to Child's excellent earlier efforts.  If you are an old Reacher fan, don't worry about sleep deprivation with this one.
1400032717|5.0|Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time by Mark Haddon<br />At first, I thought the main character in this book must be a very young boy, maybe seven-or eight-years-old. Then I though he has some learning difficulties. Finally I realized the boy is living with autism. For that, kudos to the author for a well-crafted book. It's smart and inquisitive and provides insight into autism without being condescending or coy. The boy has his eccentricities-- he doesn't like the colors brown or yellow, being touched, or going off of a schedule-- but he also enjoys and excels at math, \\"detecting,\\" and has a close relationship with his father (although he's 15 and one worries how things will change down the road when his father gets older and can no longer care for him at the level he now does). An enjoyable read.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I love the origional Star Trek MOVIES with captain Kirk but hated all the others. I figured this movie would be really stupid having the young crew but surprisingly it was pretty good. The reason I gave it 4 stars was basically because of the story line . They did such a good job on the story line that they could make a whole new series and it was good to see Spock again (Nemoy). I believe there will be a sequal and I can't wait to see it . The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because even though it was good , it still wasn't as good as the origional movies.

B002GY9F9K|3.0|I am a fan of the books. I found the series to be ok, but not the caliber of the books. So much was omitted and rewritten in the story that it is hardly the series i remember. The true evil of the world is glossed over, the books make you understand what it is to fight to be free of opression and tyranny. Yes there is blood and shocking violence, but the books help you understand the real facts involved in taking control of your life and destiny. The series just doesnt do it for me.

1400064287|4.0|book was very informative and interesting.  helps with getting a perspective on how to \\"sell\\" your ideas and counter misinformation that seems to be spreading more and more rapidly every day.    also very good for understanding and positioning proposals and ideas you may be trying to promote.
0385342020|5.0|Here's a story that has a little of everything. I'm torn on how to describe it. Hmm. Chick-lit/mystery/comedic romance? That'll do for starters. Then include snappy dialogue, great characters, humor, more twists than you can shake a stick at, and a wonderful character arc. I liked Sadie being a twenties girl who loved to dance the Charleston, drink cocktails, and smoke gaspers, while teaching her great niece to be a twenties girl, too.<br /><br />Being a little beyond \\"chick\\" age, I didn't expect to like this book, but the premise sounded fun. I didn't read Kinsella's Shopaholic books because I don't willingly shop, and don't really understand people who do. Anyway, I couldn't put Twenties Girl down. I found Uncle Bill a little one-dimensional and the ex-boyfriend a drag. Cut the boy friend problems in half and I would've enjoyed the book even more. That said, this is one that goes on my recommended list.
0385504209|3.0|Brown does have some moments that are interesting, but for the most part it is a rather mediocre book which with mass marketed genres is about the best you can expect. If you are looking for something that doesn't require too much from you, this is a decent, mindless read.
1881273989|5.0|I am not a religious person, spiritual is more of what I would call myself. I was a bit leery at first to read THe 5 love languages book because it is classified as a \\"Christian\\" marriage/ self-help book. I have to say that is part of the book, but NOT to the point where it over-rides the core message- learning how you love and how to love others. My husband and I have been married for 13 years and I was ready to leave...this was our last chance to see if there was anything left. I started reading and within a week, he was reading it, too. If you really love someone, but are having a hard time understanding them, or don't feel as loved as you should- read this book. Our marriage shifted in ways I NEVER thought possible. Just knowing each others Love Language has made a huge difference! We actually talk, share, and have a common vocabulary in which to live. I think it is so important for all adults, I bought my sister (who is single and just turning 20) a copy of this book. I think that ANYONE who wants to start a healthy relationship should read this book.
1400032717|3.0|I started reading this book as a break in between some heavier fair, and it was engaging and interesting and it kept me reading.  After getting halfway through, I was fairly certain that this character sketch was a worthwhile attempt by a first time author to capture the voice of a young autistic.  I then decided to look up some of the reviews, which I found a little disturbing.  While there are more good reviews than bad, almost exponentially more, it seemed weird to me that the Auspies would have such a negative reaction.  But then i realized, they are autistic and they have a hard time imagining that there is another autistic person not exactly like they are.  I enjoyed the book most of all because I think it revealed the stresses associated with raising an autistic child while doing so subtly.  None of the characters were very likable, which i believe is a testament to Christopher's voice being able to carry the reader through the entire book.  The ending was a little abrupt, and it seemed strange that the father would buy a yellow dog for his son that hates yellow, but other than that, I thought the story was average.
0394721772|5.0|If you think you know how to roast a chicen (like I did) then think again. Until you roast one the way Julia does it in \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" you don't know what good roast chicken tastes like. It's a little more work but makes all the difference in the world. The same can be said for the Coq au Vin and the Boeuf Bourgignon. I don't know why I waited so long to own this book but it's fantastic.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|The only thing worth seeing about this film was the end - I just laughed how stupid Hollywood has become (seriously - how do you make microwave work with the door open).    Oxymoron, but I think the original was more realistic - it had that eerie feeling that those kind of situations can actually happen (drug scoring gone bad, girl so scared she pees her pants, woman biting off the penis of the guy who raped/murdered her daughter).    To sum it up - it was so WATERED DOWN that it even missed the whole revenge concept - when your daughter is half-dead dying, would you spend time figuring out how to make microwave work with the door open or would you rush her to hospital to save her life

B00005NVHY|5.0|Ladies and Gents, \\"The Man With No Name\\" is back, and his name is Inspector Callahan.We all (most) know that 3 of the Dirty Harry films are better than the other two...they all have their moments and fave tag-lines.This Collection brings them altogether for that winter marathon, like the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series.<br /> Dirty Harry Callahan is the picture perfect series of the Old West Sheriff dragged, kicking and screaming, into the New West to clean up the town and save the day from the bad guy (or guys & gals). Not all the townsfolk like the hero's methods, but they all want or need saved (remember Lago, Big Whiskey, or the mining camp in \\"Pale Rider\\"?) We like VHS because it will FAR outlast dvd...<br /> It seems that there's a new generation who saw \\"Gran Torino\\", but never,gasp, ever, heard of Dirty Harry. If you like really nasty villains, high speed chases, sneering one-liners, and lots of flying lead, you'll love The Dirty Harry Collection. Go ahead, make your day...

0439023483|5.0|I kept hearing about The Hunger Games. On Twitter, in blog posts. People were referring to it with that \\"Oh my God you have to read this\\" language that gets one's attention. So I looked at the book's description on Amazon, and it didn't seem like my kind of thing: It's a futuristic YA novel set in a post-apocalyptic North America. The country of Panem has risen from the ashes of a continent devastated by (apparently) natural disasters. Panem is divided into twelve districts, each of which has its own specialty--agriculture or factory work or the production of luxury items. District twelve, in the Appalachian area, specializes in coal mining. It's among the poorest of the districts, if not the poorest, and its people struggle to keep themselves from starving. The book's protagonist, 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, is from district 12. She's been feeding her family for years, since her father died in a mining accident, by poaching in the woods surrounding her community, an offense which could easily get her executed. But her time in the woods has also honed her survival skills, which will prove to be essential.<br /><br />Panem is a Big Brotherish society, the civil liberties of its citizens severely restricted. Among the demands made by the government is the annual participation by each district in The Hunger Games, a reality TV show to which each district must contribute two children as participants. They're selected in a lottery--the \\"reaping\\"--that isn't quite fair: the selection process favors the rich. The winners of the reaping are compelled to participate in the Games, a televised fight to the death in which there are no rules (though cannibalism is frowned on). The one participant who's left alive at the show's end is the winner, and goes back to his or her district a fawned-over champion. If you're looking for antecedents, think The Truman Show mixed with Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery,\\"  1984 and Survivor and the ancient Greek myth of the minotaur.<br /><br />The bleak futuristic society aspect of the book was a turn-off for me. I decided I wouldn't be reading it.<br /><br />Weeks passed, and again I started seeing references to The Hunger Games, comments prompted by excitement over the recent release of the second book in the series, Catching Fire. Again I went to Amazon. Again I thought I wouldn't like the book. But I downloaded a sample to my Kindle. That was about 24 hours ago.<br /><br />It was immediately apparent from the sample that The Hunger Games was well written. By the end of the sample it was apparent that I would have to read the whole thing. I downloaded the book and devoured it, sometimes having to force myself to read more slowly because I was reading too fast, the literary equivalent of swallowing food unchewed. All of which is to say that the book is for some reason immensely readable. Katniss is a very compelling character: she's smart and motivated by sororal love; she's a survivor. But her character alone can't fully explain the book's appeal. The book never slows down. The evil government that imposes the Games on its citizens is easy to root against. The writing is flawless, at least as far as I could tell while gulping down the story. In particular, the author does an excellent job of describing the complicated details of the Games and the society of Panem so that they're easily digested and don't come across as instructional or out of place. It's a great, great read.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel>The bleak futuristic society aspect of the book was a turn-off for me.

B002BWQ6H6|5.0|I remember when Philippe Petit did his tightrope walk between the Trade Center towers. I was late for work and didn't linger, but I saw him and I was thrilled.    This astonishing and lovely book uses that walk to highlight the oblique connections which bind New Yorkers. The characters run the range and diversity of City dwellers and share the leveling moments that erode the barriers between them. Intimate strangers, and all that.    The language is tight and fresh and genuine. I really liked most of these people. They surprised me, made me laugh and made me cry.    This is a great book about New Yorkers. Thank you, Colum McCann.
0385341008|2.0|This book wants very much to be 64 Charing Cross Road.  It isn't up to it.  The voices all sound the same; the insights are shallow.  I could not get past the first hundred pages (and that rarely happens).
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Well, it wasn't what I expected. I really enjoyed this movie and found myself watching it several times to get all the dialogue from it. The characters were well portrayed, gangbangers were spot on. I used to know someone in my neighborhood like Clint's character.  I really enjoyed the girl Sue's character who was strong. Also nice to see a movie that isn't always politically correct, the real world isn't always like that. Not really a big action flick but was a nice change.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Watchmen was absolutely everything I wanted it to be and so much more.  It's a perfect adaptation that literally uses the graphic novel as its script.  The panel for panel imitation was very exciting to see for the first time on the big screen.  Everyone I talk to who has not read the book, dislikes the movie overall.  I can see that it must be hard to get sucked into this film without reading the graphic novel.  However, the overall consensus for those who have read the comic, consider it possibly the best comic book movie of all time.  Zack Snyder directed the movie we thought was impossible.  And he did it better than we could have imagined.<br /><br />I keep hearing the insulting complaints as to the male nudity in the movie.  How are we, a country, so sexist that when we see male nudity in a movie we instantly yell and scream and insult the ones enjoying the film.  Malin was nude as well in this movie, and not a lot of people seemed to complain about that.  I'm not a homosexual, but due to the fact im well aware of my own anatomy, the whole naked Dr. Manhattan didn't bother me that much.  He wasn't plastered across the whole screen.  I could easily focus on another area of the screen.  I hardly notice it when I watch the blu-ray at home.  Grow up people, we all have reproductive organs.<br /><br />On a completely different side-note, I'm pretty satisfied with the release's special features.  The commentary was a lot of fun and the behind the scenes were very interesting.  I hoped for more, but this was better than nothing.  One point I do want to bring up is this :\\"Directors, if a viewer is watching a commentary, assume that they have already watched the film and now important plot points.\\"  I'm tired of useless commentary where all I hear is \\"This is a scene where Dr. Manhattan talks to Laurie.  I know, I've seen the movie!  Narrating the plots of the film is entirely useless.  We're watching the movie, we know whats going on.  I'd rather hear, \\"In this scene we used this for this and It was a challenge to execute this\\"  Blu-ray commentaries need evolution.<br /><br />I haven't spoken much on the film, because it's really indescribable.  You need to view it for yourself and be subject to the unique experience.  It's like nothing you've seen before and it breaks barriers of previous superhero movies.  I'll reccomend renting first, just because the reviews are so diverse on this product.  Some will love it and some will hate it.  Thats the very interesting thing about it.  It commands so much thought from us and the world has quite a discussion about it.  Bad movies go unnoticed.  Controversial movies get argued over for a long time. Watchmen is a controversial movie  that will absolutely change your world even if you appreciate it or not.  It's a revolutionary film, by the talented Zack Snyder.we used this for this and It was a challenge to execute this\\"  Blu-ray commentaries need evolution.<br /><br />I haven't spoken much on the film, because it's really indescribable.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I was brought up in the fifties and taught that the strong, silent type is the model for young men to emulate.  Henry Fonda fits that role to a \\"T\\" plus he's got smarts and soul. Plus there are great character and supporting actors (including the female playing Fonda's mother) in this movie. Your film collection is not complete without this masterpiece.  I named my daughter Rose of Sharon while going through hard times though they weren't near as bad as those of Dust Bowl dwellers.

0545123267|4.0|This books is actually rated three-and-half stars, but the ending was so beautiful that I just gave in and clicked four stars.     This book was beautiful -absolutely beautiful. I'll admit that it dragged A LOT and nothing really happened throughout the book. If you're a die-hard romantic and a fan of Twilight, then I highly recommend this book. Both contain star-crossed lovers in a paranormal world. However, I found Shiver to be more of a pleasant read than Twilight, due to its writing style. Not only that, it was less, less cheesy -no cliche, gag-inflecting phrases.    Here are what I liked about the book:  1) Steifvater's new, interesting take on the werewolf lore -instead of changing during the full-moon, these wolves change when the weather turns cold.  2) Though Grace annoyed me at times with her aggressive behavior toward her friends/family, I found it rejuvenating when it was towards Sam. Most YA paranormal romance these days have spineless heroines and heroes who initiate all the intimacy. However, in this book, Grace was the one instigating all the hugging, kissing, and cuddling.     Here are my negative views on the book:  1) I found it unrealistic that Grace bought into the werewolf lore so easily. I thought that it would make more sense if she had some doubts, instead of wholeheartedly believing the wolf that saved her years ago was actually human inside.  2) Did anyone else find it absolutely ridiculous that Grace's parents are so oblivious to everything with no parenting skills whatsoever? They're practically not even in the book! I found it absolutely repulsive that Grace's dad left her in the car baked in the sun so long that she had to hospitalized.   3) Unlike most people, I did not like the two different point of views from Grace and Sam. It gave too much away. I would very much rather have just Grace telling the story, that way we would have some suspense. This is probably why the story dragged.    Overall, this book isn't a favorite of mine, but it was a good read. I still prefer Blood and Chocolate by Annette Curtis Klause better. It was sexier and much, much more fun to read.
0345495004|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read. The main character, Mamah, is narcissistic, selfish, and boring, while Frank Lloyd Wright behaved throughout the novel like a petulant child. I hated every single page of it. It's been four months since I read the book, and my blood pressure still rises when I think about it! The writing is flat, the story is irksome, and the end is a total sucker-punch. Don't waste your time.
0385333846|5.0|An excellent excellent novel.  I highly recommend reading this... I couldn't put it down.
4893580914|5.0|So, I had been looking around for a kanji book for quite some time to study in between my actual Japanese classes over the summer. I wanted to find something where I could easily learn without having to find other person to guide me along, and could figure things out from just the book. I think this book definitely has everything you could want in a book like that. There space for practicing writing them, practices that involve using multiple kanji to make new words(allowing you both on- and kun- pronunciation efficiently), and reading practice. I would definitely recommend this to the self-studying, and really any learner of Japanese.
B002BEXG86|5.0|'Killer' has always been one of the big cannons in Alice Cooper's catalog (Alice Cooper the GROUP that is).  This remaster on the Audio Fidelity label by Steve Hoffman doesn't disappoint!  I am not going to go into all the great songs and riffs on this CD, just read all the other reviews if you need to know how great this album is, but as others have said before, this CD was long over due for a proper remastering and now it has one.  Audio Fidelity and Steve Hoffman have done an excellent job on this CD (and also the 'School's Out' CD if you're interested in that title as well). The low end (thank you Dennis Dunaway) and the drums (thank you Neal Smith) sound clear and robust, the guitars just rock out like no tomorrow, and Alice, well, is just Alice in his prime, 'nuff said.  Because they used NO compression or limiting during the remastering process it might not sound as 'loud' as most CD's in your collection but it will blow your socks off if you give it a little volume boost to make up for it.  Alice Cooper fans can start to to rejoice, we now have 'Killer', 'School's Out' and 'Billion Dollar Babies' on remaster CD.  I am hoping that Audio Fidelity (or Warner's or Rhino or somebody) will soon remaster their classic 'Love It To Death' album as well (and 'Muscle Of Love' too please while you're at it).  Money well spent!
1601251505|5.0|I love this book. The changes to the 3.5 system are mostly improvements, with better balanced character classes with a more steady progression if abilities and improved skill system (yes, you fighter can now actually notice things), and logical improvements, such as changing the arcane spellcasters to D6 for hit dice and rogues to D8. This book, to me, is better than 4th edition, in that it still feels like Dungeons & Dragons.<br /><br />My main two complaints are:<br /><br />1. Somewhere/somehow the book needed to highlight changes. This is close enough to 3.5 that people tend not to look closely at the rules in places and miss changes. For example, the Cleric has lost Heavy Armor proficiency, but you have to look closely to notice it missing from the description of Clerics.<br /><br />2. The book weighs a ton, as it combines the Player's Handbook and DMG, and one wonders if they would have been better split.<br /><br />But overall, this is great!

(-:<br />It was just her and two dancers (one being her now estranged brother Christopher Ciccone!)<br />with 4 club tracks (\\"Holiday\\", \\"Everybody\\", \\"Borderline\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\") with just<br />the background vocals on them and she danced and sang the lead vocals live!<br />She already had the air of a star even back then!--The way she carried herself and<br />performed passionately for that relatively small crowd of a few hundred very rowdy<br />and screaming fans, even though nobody really knew who she was at that time!<br /><br />Fast forward four very eventful years later and Madge was worldwide sensation!<br />Enter this fantastic album \\"True Blue\\" in the summer of 1986, which was packed full<br />of what would turn out to be pop classics: \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\",<br />\\"Live To Tell\\", \\"Where's The Party\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\", all of which are still<br />well loved by her fans and performed in all of her live incarnations since then.<br />Dedicated to the self-confessed love of her life, former hubby, Sean Penn...<br />\\"True Blue\\", with it's unforgettable cover photoby the late Herb Ritts<br />and memorable pop hits, paint a perfect picture of what was hot and cutting edge in 1986.<br />I can't tell you how many times me and my freinds danced our butts off<br />to \\"Where's The Party\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\" mixed and extended to perfection<br />by whomever was the hot DJ of the time at whatever club we were feeling!<br />\\"La Isla Bonita\\" is just eternal with me!--That song will never play out!<br />\\"Live To Tell\\" was the theme song from a very good movie starring Sean Penn<br />and Christopher Walken called \\"At Close Range\\", which did really well back then.<br />All of these factors combine to make \\"True Blue\\" my number one favorite album<br />in the classic 80's catalogue of Madonna output which she made her name on!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just finished the first 5 (full) days of this Shred workout dvd and it's excellent!  20 minute workout.  Hard.  But I actually say `thank you' at the end of each one, it's so rewarding.  And short.  And, did I mention, HARD?  First two days I couldn't finish but maybe 5 minutes - was shaking and amazed at how hard it was.  Especially since had been doing a `bootcamp' workout dvd - but that was nothing - not all that easy but it wasn't hard, either.  NOTHING like this.  So, after resting one day, tried again, and completed 2 of the 3 circuits before quitting but felt much better to do at least that much.  The next day went through all 3 circuits (the 3rd circuit really is easiest, tho you're tired by then) and just finished the 5th full day - can't say it got that much easier, but after 10 days plan to try the level 2 (there's also a level 3).  Jillian keeps it moving - weights, cardio, abs in each of the 3 circuits, and each circuit has variations, which keeps it interesting - time flies actually, and unlike some workouts, don't get irritated by her chatter - it's focused and useful.  I'm 57 and not a couch potato, but really have never worked out this hard.  The main thing, though, is how motivating Jillian is.  One other point: the other 'bootcamp' dvd was jolting to my knees and it was hard to modify the movement to avoid that, basically making it impossible to really follow along and do the workout.  Not with this workout; you have jumping jacks and other similar movements, but nothing you can't modify if knees are a concern.  In fact, this dvd offers a wide range of options, based on your level of fitness, yet the options are guided, so you're not having to figure it all out yourself - you can just focus on remaining conscious and breathing... :)
B001V7YJMG|5.0|A great movie the complete opposite side of the Hollywood  sex, drugs and cool leather cloths and the romantic side of being a Vampire. It shows in a very convincing fashion that being a vampire is a lonely rode to take. This movie is raw and gritty and since I know a little bit of the language they have much more to say the what the English titles read. But never the less from a vampire alternate reality reader and movie watcher this is really up in my top 5 movies and the book is for this year in the top 2.<br />If your looking for Vampire Fantasy this is not for you. But I do think it good for some one who has seen nothing but the supposed gift of mortality. In the glamor vampire movies they talk about the hunger that compels them to hunt. We have always seen a man or woman vampire angry at what had been done to them and the way the movie is set up you wonder why and what is it that makes them so angry at there makers. This movie could shine a lite on why one would not be happy with such a life style. This movie takes away all the nonsense of having blood banks all over the place this movie is set at the raw nature that the original story says. They hunger for human blood no animal will do, and the blood must come from the human at that very moment or at least before it turns cold. Its just a Vampire movie story brought back to the basics of it survival.<br />Buy it Rent it borrow it what ever you have to do just watch it
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I was a HUGE Whitney Houston fan in the 80s and 90s.  Her songs were catchy and/or powerful.  You WANTED to listen to them over and over again.  Unfortunately, her latest CD in many, many years is just kinda...average.  I kept hearing/reading that her 2nd single from the CD (and the first track on the CD) \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" was catchy.  I listened to it first and...meh.  I didn't get the hype.  Hopefully with repeated listening, I'll enjoy the songs more.

If you're an experienced brewer, you may find it hard to quickly look up certain information in this book, which is a pain in the neck.  For example, this book contains many recipes, spread throughout the book based on technique used to brew the beer -- but the recipes aren't in the index.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|this album is one of my favorite  albums of all time!!the doors music was and is  so visionary.this album was so perfect for 1967 and the psychedelic scene.  even though this album was released in 1967 it still sounds brilliant to this day the only song on it i can do without is alabama whiskey song.the rest is amazing.so take the highway to the end of the night and grab this album!!
B000INAXGU|5.0|The greatest hits collection of Jamiroquai is an essential, must-have collection of the best of the hippest funk/jazz band of the 90s.<br /><br />Every song that made Jamiroquai cool in the early 90s is here for people's listening enjoyment. Its coolest songs from its first album, \\"Emergency on Planet Earth,\\" appropriately kick the album to a fresh start. Hits such as \\"Too Young to Die\\" sound so funky that anyone will want to dance to them. However, the hottest track in this period was the title track, \\"Emergency on Planet Earth.\\" Everything, from Stuart Zender's riff-laden bass guitar, to the disco drums of Nick Van Gelder, sounds like a saucy Stevie Wonder track if it collided with the hard-hitting staccato drums of a Michael Jackson song.<br /><br />Probably the spotlight of \\"High Times: Singles,\\" however, is the music video version of the song \\"Space Cowboy,\\" first debuted on their second album, \\"The Return of the Space Cowboy.\\" This is easily considered the zaniest version of the song, with some radical breaks in which Stuart Zender bust out a crazy bass riff and drummer Gelder rips up the track infectious break-beats. Among other things, Kay's vocals sound much more crystal-clear and exciting than the original \\"Return of the Space Cowboy\\" version.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this greatest hits albums leaves out many of the other countless hits from \\"The Return of the Space Cowboy.\\" Listeners will throw a tantrum over the exclusion of one of their best songs, \\"Light Years.\\" Worse still, the greatest hits collection chops out all the cool solo parts in \\"Virtual Insanity\\" and \\"High Times.\\" Fans will especially miss the killer guitar solo and keyboard solo in \\"High Times.\\"<br /><br />Thankfully, the record makes up for its flaws by including possibly their greatest single of all time, \\"Deeper Underground.\\" This single was only found on the \\"Godzilla\\" motion picture soundtrack, but it became a big hit, exploding on the pop radio waves. Although it didn't have as big an impact as Rage Against the Machine's single from the same album, it was definitely the one of Jamiroquai's best.<br /><br />Also, \\"High Times\\" does a good job in weeding out the best songs from the band's fourth, fifth and sixth albums. This period is considered by some as a low period in the band's career. Sadly, drummer Gelder left the band due to issues with Jay Kay. The awesome didgeridoo player, Wallis Buchanan, also left the group. Thankfully, their vibe remained unshaken, with probably their most memorable hit, \\"Canned Heat.\\" Other songs, such as \\"Love Foolosophy\\" and \\"Feels Just Like It Should,\\" continue the band's streak for hot dance floor hits.<br /><br />Although the band's tone has turned much more electronic and experimental in its newest albums, each album is a unique metamorphosis of Jamiroquai's sound. In a nutshell, \\"High Times\\" is one of the best greatest hits collections for a 90s group. It sums up all the great peaks in creativity for one of the funkiest bands during the grunge rock era.chine's single from the same album, it was definitely the one of Jamiroquai's best.

6305428557|5.0|American moviegoers, I am sad to say, have a tendency to think of comedy only in broad terms. If a film isn't filled with bawdy jokes or slapstick humor, then it can't possibly be really funny, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />\\"The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain\\" is a gentle comedy about simple people in a small Welsh village during World War I who take great pride in the mountain in whose valley the town is located. But when two British surveyors come to measure the mountain as a part of the war effort, the townsfolk are dismayed to discover that -- at least by the British standards -- their mountain is only a hill. Of course, the Welsh will do anything to ensure that their mountain is deemed a mountain.<br /><br />Underlying the humor of this film is the poignancy of a community that is trying to hold on to its identity in the face of a war that has devastated the population and has left the community something of a shadow of its former self. They have lost men in war -- some killed, some who come back shell-shocked -- and so they do what they can and what they must in order to hang on to their identity. The scene in which a shell-shocked young man journeys up the mountain during a thunderstorm is particularly moving.<br /><br />Although the Brits can do broad, over-the-top comedy as well as anyone else (Monty Python comes to mind), they also have the knack of doing small, gentle comedies as well as, if not better, than anyone else. And the scenery of Wales is absolutely breathtaking.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|This is a very well made movie. It is a fantastic family film and we highly recommend it!
B002BVYBBK|5.0|Even though I've seen this many, many times, seeing it on Blu-ray was like seeing it for the first time.  All the Fast and Furious movies are prime examples of awesome Blu-ray can look and sound.  The audio is just ridiculous on this movie.  Really really loud and clean.  Having a good home-theatre system helps too.  I highly recommend Definitive Technolgy bipolar speakers, available at Amazon.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD. I have enjoyed watching it over and over.  It turned out to be a better deal than I had anticipated as I actually thought it was a CD I was purchasing.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|I read many reviews before seeing the Blu-ray release and was not sure what to expect.  How a lot of reviewers saw this before it was released, I'd like to know.  I would, because that's a nice connection!  I took advantage of Bestbuy's deal for Gladiator and Braveheart, but before I opened my copy, I rented it, just to be safe.  After all the negative reviews, I was looking for every flaw mentioned, and I did not really see what other reviewers saw.  If anything, the better technology is, the more it exposes flaws.  You can really see how made-up some of these stars are.  Maybe a lot of what people are complaining about just was not apparent until you see it on Blu-ray.  Could they have done better?  Always possible.  There was definately nothing to complain about here. Only a few scenes in the movie were really a couple of minutes long, and maybe then could I tell a slight difference.  I was also looking for things because of all the negative reviews, which kind of isn't fair.  I gave this movie 4 insted of 5 stars because sometime the faces did look a tad artificial, but with the constant back-and-forth between light and dark, who's really to say except Ridely Scott, what it should look like.  Definate step up from the dvd, although the DTS es audio was actually louder at a lower volume.  The picture was definately not as sharp on the dvd.  If they can make this picture better, I'd sure like to see it.  As always, see it with your own eyes and decide for yourself.
0385737424|5.0|I agree with the reader who said it deserves more than 5 stars.  Such a great read!  I just loved tis book.  I especially enjoy the way Stead gives her readers credit for their intelligence.  There are abstract, sophistocated themes and events here that are not in any way dumbed down.  I consider myself to be a pretty sophistocated reader, and I found it enjoyable on an adult level.  Strongly recommended for those who have enjoyed \\"A Wrinkle in Time.\\"
0143038583|5.0|The subject matter of this book is so important! Read it and then read the next book he wrote. The book is very informative but also well written. Hopefully, this book will influence humans to change the way we shop for food and what we choose to eat.
143915726X|5.0|This was a great book. I could not put it down. I had never read anything by this author before but I certainly will again. I was captured by the very first pages. I laughed out loud, I cried, I debated issues and how I thought I would handle things. I was not ready for the surprise at the end. Wow. Fantastic. Looking forward to seeing the movie, looking forward to my next Jodi Picoult book!
B000BZIST4|5.0|As long as you're not easily offended, there's a lot to enjoy in this gritty film. No doubt aided by Friedkin's background in documentary filmmaking, the handheld cameras are reminiscent of later works by Paul Greengrass (director of the second two Bourne movies).<br /><br />Seven bucks for the Two-Disc Collector's Edition? Ridiculously good deal. Includes a full-length commentary by the director, plus commentary snippets from Hackman and Scheider. Also a couple documentaries, deleted scenes, and more.<br /><br />I don't like DVD cover but that's just nitpicking. The one from the Blu-Ray release is better, but from what I've heard, the content itself on that release isn't.<br /><br />FYI the sequel isn't even in the same league.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Could not put it down, tremendously touching and inspiring.  I have a very old dog who is more human than dog and means the world to me... 'until we meet again, Boy!'
B000002OX7|5.0|Okay, what's wrong this 1995 remastered version and why the later reissues?  Come on MCA or whoever, just give us the definitive remaster and be done about it - or is this it(?).
B0028K3192|5.0|If you like R&B, soul, or any of Maxwell's previous albums, get this album NOW.  It is probably my favorite cd of 2009, and I think the song Pretty Wings is an instant classic.  I think the fact that it only has 9 cuts is actually a good thing.  It just adds to the overall complete package - no fluff, no bad songs, just awesome, soulful, heartfelt music.
B00168OINK|5.0|I had not seen this movie in the theaters but I had heard rave reviews about it. So I snagged this one on sale. The movie is hilarious and very entertaining and the visuals only make this movie that much better. Watching this on full 1080p through my ps3 is just amazing. These newer animations on Blu Ray just look amazing. I will be purchasing anything made by pixar and or disney, not only because they look spectacular but they are usually quite entertaining.

This edition addresses the issue slightly, but as you can see, not by much. One issue that was fixed is the total number of questions. The first edition claimed (just like this one) to have 300 questions, but only had 294 - how can you make that mistake in the Official Guide for Quantitative Review? The question split is 176 for PS and 124 for DS.    As to content, changes, it is interesting to see many of the tables and data-interpretation questions go and addition of sequence questions. Also, DS lost many of its arithmetic questions, which were replaced by Word Problems.

0545101417|5.0|but there's plenty.<br /><br />I had read the early reviews and couldn't imagine how Suzanne Collins would top The Hunger Games.  How could there be a bigger challenge than the games arena Katniss encountered in the first book?  Rest assured that there is no shortage of creative physical threats and attacks on the major characters.  Each plot twist is fresh but does not lead the book astray from the central conflict between the Capital and the people of the districts.<br /><br />The character development in Catching Fire is also gratifying.  We gain insights into Gale's life and thoughts, see Peeta emerge with new poise and presence; even Haymitch has new depth and complexity.  For those obsessed with Katniss' love life, I won't give anything away except to say that she starts out still torn between the very different but worthy Gale and Peeta.<br /><br />As a teacher of literature at the Middle School level, I saw lots of possibilities in this book - symbolism of birds, fire and bread throughout the novel; the continuing allusion to classical mythology (Just how long did it take Theseus to emerge from the labyrinth?); a discussion of the names Collins chose for her characters and their underlying meanings (Why is the evil President named Snow, but snow is a miracle cure for healing in the hands of Katniss' mother?).<br /><br />On the other hand, the violence of the police state is more graphic than the bloodshed in the first book, so parents and teachers should recommend this book only to students who are mature enough to handle this aspect of the story.<br /><br />Carolyn McCormick reads with appropriate expression, tone and clarity.  Voices of the different characters are unique and recognizable.  My one minor criticism is that Katniss' voice sounds too sweet sometimes.  I'm not sure what I expect her to sound like - slightly more tomboyish, perhaps. She is still a young girl, however, and a hint of anxiety or indecision should be expected.  The organization of the material on the 10 compact discs actually increases the suspense, as several cliffhangers occur at the end of a disc.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  Can't wait for the sequel.  Long live the mockingjay!he material on the 10 compact discs actually increases the suspense, as several cliffhangers occur at the end of a disc.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B00003CXTG|4.0|I liked this film and thats why I bought it, however when it said it was a two disk set I mistakenly thought (by the way it was worded) that it would have an extra disk with Pearl Harbor history on it. Nope, in fact if you want to watch the whole movie, you have to change to disk 2 to finish it.<br /><br />I am sure I should have been able to figure that out, but it wasn't really very clear and although I am not bummed I bought the DVD, I would rather have had everything on one Disk.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best rock albums in recent memory. Every track is great. Tremonti's solos are awe-inspiring and Kennedy's vocals are incredibly powerful. You can feel the passion in every song. It's one of my all time favorite albums; I can't wait for their next release.
B00005AREQ|5.0|All I can say is Jeff Beck ROCKS!!!. One of the best guitar players of all time in my opinion. And this is one of his best works.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|This has become my favorite animated film yet. Both my wife and I absolutely love this movie, she says I'm her wall e and she's my eva. We saw this in the theaters and it was just amazing, funny and the visuals were outstanding. When it came out on Blu Ray, it was a must buy, and thank goodness we did. Watching it on Blu makes the movie even better than the theaters. Watching it in full 1080p is amazing and when you have a home theater set up to match, its a wonder why we even go to the theaters anymore. The movie is really funny and cute and it has a really good story as well as a message. We watched this with our neice and her cousin, both are about 6 years old, so whenever we babysit, that's our go to movie, it satisfies us all. This is a definite must own.
0786838655|4.0|I thought this was a great quick read. It makes the world of mythology and myth come alive to the modern day child. I can't wait for my little boy to be old enough to read it! The only complaint I have is that I didn't like how it followed a Harry Potter pattern with the characters, the quest, etc. Other than that it was great.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I loved the cd and the thriller dvd was great loved the way MJ danced and sang on the thriller tape I would recamend every Michael Jackson fan to get this.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I am really annoyed at people whinning about Whitney's voice is gone. Yes, her voice is different, and the high notes aren't here in this album. But please have some humanity! Whitney is a person, not a sound machine which produces incredible high notes for listeners' enjoyment!    To evaluate an artist's work, it's essential to include the backgrounds and contexts and treat him/her as a human being. Whitney is in her mid-40's. She can not and should not sing, act, and dance like a 20-year-old anymore! Everybody knows what she has been through. Thankfully those negative experiences left a mark on Whitney's voice. Now her voice is much more mature, emotional, vulnerable, yet still powerful with resilence.    This CD finds a way to balance between current pop/hip-hop grooves and Whitney's transformed voice and life attitudes. I am not saying it's perfect, but it's definitely appropriate and necessary. Personally I wish there were some more jazz and soulful numbers, but I'm satisfied with the inspirational \\"I Look To You\\" and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\". After all, this is a comeback album. She needs more contemporary sound to achieve successful sales which her future career lies upon. But I am looking foward to hearing some Etta, Gladys, or Dionne in her next album.    As for those contemporary tracks, they are not bad at all! I was very afraid to hear Whitney mimic Rihanna, Beyonce, or Ciara...etc. Thank God she has her own style to transfrom those hip-hop/dance tracks into her own. Her ability to interprete songs is amazing. She really owns the songs! A plain song just 'shines' when she sings it. My personal favorites are \\"For The Lovers\\" and \\"Call You Tonight\\".     Overall, I find this CD very enjoyable, comfortable, and powerful. It's full of empowering statements and positive energy. In this very depressing moment worldwide, this CD surely can triumph people's hearts!! That's why I give her five stars.
0307266303|5.0|I had left Running for about a year and started reading this book after my dad gave it to me. Perhaps the best book I've ever read and I don't usually review items I buy but I had to write one for this one. Just a great story and very well written. Since finishing it I've been running everyday and ready for my half marathon race in a few months. Wish It hadnt taken a book but it gave me my runners high that I had been missing. Thank you McDougall! Youll love this book pick up a copy if you love running or want too.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is a great movie!! If you love golf, you gotta love this (plus a true story)!
B001VPJYZK|2.0|Believe it or not, I'd never seen DH until earlier this year (maybe an episode here and there).  At the suggestion of several friends and family members, I began watching season 1.  I fell in love with the show and bought each following season.    While I was watching these, I wasn't watching season 5, waiting to watch them all together.    I am so disappointed with this season!    Where do I begin?    I hate that they jumped 5 years.  But since they did, why on earth do they present plot lines through flash backs in almost every episode?    Does anything good happen to these people this season?  Carlos got his sight back, that's pretty much it.  All the hard times on everyone proved for depressing viewing.  I'm having hard times myself, I don't need to see it on Wisteria Lane.  What happened to all the comedy?    I can't believe they killed off Edie.  Huge mistake.  The show won't be the same without her.  Edie was fun, and her quick wit and sharp tongue always cut to the truth of the matter.      While I'm on the subject of Edie, does anyone believe for a minute that Edie would give Dave the time of day, let alone marry the guy?  He is totally opposite the type of guy she likes.    And as everyone points out, really stupid mystery.  A child could figure it out right away.    The gay couple which were introduced in season 4 are barely utilized in season 5.  For the first few episodes, they're merely decoration.  Marc Cherry, a gay man, should be ashamed of himself.  He is really letting down a huge fanbase of the show.    The men are all pretty useless this year, except for the \\"villian\\".  Orsen becoming a clepto? Come on!  Tom having ANOTHER mid-life crisis?  Been there, done that.  If only Gale Harold hadn't had his motorcycle accident, I wonder what they would've done with his character?    Terri Hatcher was completely annoying this season, and she was always one of my favorite characters.  They made Marcia Cross's Bree as cold as stone this season.  We saw nothing beneath this woman's hard exterior.  And what a pity about Dana Delany.  This great actress had to make do in season 5 with whatever paltry tidbits they threw her, after giving her such a great storyline in season 4.    So what, in my opinion, recommends this season at all?    The Eli Scruggs episode--flashbacks, but really great sentimental writing.  Outstanding performance by Beau Bridges.    The episode where the girls scatter Edie's ashes--again with the flashbacks, but Nicolette Sheridan really shines before fading out.  Also some of the loveliest writing of the season.  These 2 episodes ALMOST re-deem the season.    Eva Longoria's Gabrielle is finally humbled by poverty (enough with the head bands, though), but mid-way through gets back to her shallow self.    They do a little more with the Karen McCluskey character, who is great fun.  Maybe she'll fill Edie's shoes.    The children of Gaby and Susan are adorable (but I miss Lynette's little ones).    Anyway, if you purchase this season, it will be because, like myself, you've become attached to these characters, and want to follow them, even during the down seasons.  And every great show has at least one of those.      Let's hope they come back in Season 6.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I cherish this DVD.  It's a wonderful glimpse of MJ at his finest.  I'm so happy Amazon.com had this available and at a great price.
B000002O3I|5.0|The ideal compilation is the one you assemble yourself. And at this point in technological history, you don't have to pay David Geffen for the privilege. [Yeah, that's who gets paid if you buy this thing. Maybe he can invest the money in developing the ability to fit an additional song on a 66-minute CD.]    But do get the music by one means or another. The blues singing on The Rocking Chair Album is just an apocalypse... demonically powerful performances. When he sings \\"I AM... A BACK DOOR MAN\\" [the capital letters feel appropriate], he makes you believe it. Next to this, Jim Morrison sounds like a belching frat boy.
0545123267|5.0|Grace has been infatuated with the wolves that reside in the woods around her home for years. Even after a mauling it never deterred her feelings for them. On the other hand, she became even more intrigued by them... but especially \\"her wolf\\" - the one with the golden eyes.<br /><br />Sam leads a double life. In the winter he's all fur and lives amongst the members of his pack - but never once forgets the girl who silently watches him. When the weather warms up he gets a few months where he becomes human.<br /><br />But when Grace stumbles upon a wounded boy with golden eyes... she is taken back by all the similarities. Could it possibly be her wolf? As winter nears, Sam must fight to stay human - or risk losing himself, and Grace, forever.<br /><br />This is one I've been gushing to everyone I know and recommending that they get a copy stat. I fell in love with this book. The Steifvater's writing is just so beautiful and the cover art (which she drew herself) is stunning. Grace and Sam's love story is one that I would put up there with Edward & Bella; Sookie & Eric/Bill?. It definitely gave me goose bumps and sent butterflies scurrying about in my stomach.<br /><br />I loved that each chapter started with the temperature... it definitely made you feel tense as the temperature dropped. I was on edge the whole time - wondering what would happen. Would Grace lose Sam - would he forget their time shared together once he changed back? All in all, it was wonderful. The pace was perfect and the characters were unforgettable.<br /><br />This story has it all -- sci-fi, mystery, coming-of-age, the ups and downs of friendship, and of course -- romance. READ IT!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I've never quite gotten the whole Radiohead hype. I always felt they were a solid band when then veered off into electro-land five years after everyone else did but that they had a sense of melody and arrangement that saved them from being trite.<br /><br />But kudos to Radiohead for their 'pay what you please' arrangement with this album. I certainly wouldn't have paid any mind to the fact they had a new album out but if you could download for free, well why not! Surprise! RH have created an incredibly mature, progressive, and listenable album.<br /><br />Most of what has made this a heavy-rotation disc (yes I bought the CD eventually) has to do with their keen sense of arrangement and production. From updated DNB sounds on the first track to taught rockers the band knows how to capture your attention, hold it, then change direction right before you get bored. There's plenty of ear candy thanks to their extensive synth collection and producer Nigel Godrich and I have to give credit - it doesn't get stale or gimmicky on repeated listens. But their well-honed sense of melody married to seemingly oblique vocal lines and lyrics is probbaly the clincher.<br /><br />Vocalists get heaps (too much?) praise but in case of Yorke, he really gives a great band depth and dimension. I really love the tension between longing and alienation that permeates virtually every track. Even in the seductive \\"House of Cards\\" there is a sense of cherishing the relationship in all it's impermanent beauty. We feel like voyeurs, compelled to watch the drama from start to finish.<br /><br />I went back and checked out other RH albums and in context this makes sense. Moving out of the electro-experimentation of KidA/Amnesiac to the more straight-ahead Hail to the Thief, this album pulls together the exploration of earlier works into a cohesive whole with nothing to prove, save creating another great albums.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Next to [[ASIN:B0021L8UP8 Away We Go [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B001KVZ6G6 Up (4 Disc Combo Pack with Digital Copy and DVD) [Blu-ray]]], one of my favorite movies of the summer and probably the year! Of course, I am a bit biased since I love Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In the time of cliched romantic comedies that do little to entertain and simply churn out the same old rom-com formula to perpetuate the two romantic ideals of unrealistic plots: (1) the knight in shining armor comes in to save the girl; or (2) the jerk/rebel who's just misunderstood and can change his ways if only he met the right girl -- there is a great newcomer to romantic comedies that I can only hope Hollywood embraces as a model. And \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is the template.<br /><br />Gordon-Levitt, one of my favorite actors, plays Tom (with whom I can definitely relate), a diehard romantic. He meets Summer (Deschanel) who doesn't believe in love and being \\"tied down.\\" However, that doesn't stop their relationship from blooming into romance. Right up front, the narrator informs us that \\"this is a story of boy meets girl, however, this is not a love story.\\" Told in fragmented segments (hence, the 500 days), the story brings out the realistic feelings and moments in a relationship, yet displays them with the techniques of an indie film, referencing musicals, avant-garde/New Wave French cinema, documentary and Hollywood-glossy romantic movie as we see the lovable highs and pathetic lows of Tom and Summer's love life.<br /><br />It's pretty safe to say that nearly everyone in their 20s and older probably has been in a relationship like this one, whether they've been Tom or Summer. And, hopefully, anyone who has experienced such a relationship makes it to that 500th day that is so perfectly and realistically captured in the film. Director Marc Webb, who is only known for directing music videos, successfully debuts as a feature film director, although one can tell through his techniques that he made his mark directing in the video format. Of course, I would also be remiss if I forgot to mention the superb use of excellent music in this film. The soundtrack ([[ASIN:B002BAODSC (500) Days Of Summer-Music From The Motion Picture]]) is a must-have!<br /><br />The supporting cast is great (especially Chloe Moretz - who I can't wait to see in the film adaptation of [[ASIN:0785132619 Kick-Ass]], Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler, who has one of the sweetest, romantic lines in the film), but Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt and their chemistry are the genius, charming center of this film. And although marketed as \\"not a love story,\\" \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is just that. It's just not the kind of love story that sugar-coats and idealizes every thing that is love; it's not the usual Hollywood love story. This film also showcases the heartbreak and letdown that can come with love. And not in that formulaic \\"someone-screws-up-or-comes-between-the-two-lovers-and-they-have-to-overcome-it-or-confront-their-feelings-in-front-of-the-other-to-move-on-and-live-happily-ever-after\\" kind of way. Whew. That's a lot of dashes.<br /><br />No. The obstacles in this film are presented with a realistic intensity that Gordon-Levitt pulls off effortlessly. And no, Summer is not a bitch who leads Tom on. It's not that simple to label her as that. In fact, she says right up front that she's not looking for anything serious. However, as with any relationship, emotions can take over and take us to unexpected places. And Deschanel's Summer finds herself honestly opening up in no way that had with other past suitors. Deschanel portrays the object of Tom's affection with a charm and slight tragedy -- seen brilliantly when she and Tom are watching the awesome ending to [[ASIN:B00000F798 The Graduate (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]] -- that I only hope helps her to broaden her resume since Hollywood could use more of her. By the end of the film, you care for both characters and wish the best for both of them. You see Tom's necessary awakening that helps him to grow from this unrealistic, naive romantic to someone who can still dream of true love but also see true relationships for what they are. This comes to fruition in the film's climax when Tom and Summer reconcile and there's a silent moment between the two where the viewer recognizes that these two characters have come full circle and it was through their experiences and relationship with one another that helped them each to grow in great ways. Now, if only every other rom-com movie nowadays made me feel that way! Unfortunately, like another great little movie called [[ASIN:B000X1Z0BU Once]], \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" was in limited release, but that only makes it a rare little gem that only the most diehard of moviegoers will treasure when they find it.

B001RTP48G|5.0|super album - thats what we calld them in the day.   then as now i like to listen to an album from begining to end, it showes the artist ability to present a complete body of work and when done well a fuilfilling experience that is more than a quickie. a good album is like a nice ramantic evening or weekend with lots of climatic experinces. that is exactly what Pet shop Boys have delivered in \\"YES\\".    nice upbeat , energetic, and  soothing at the same time.   The pet shop Boys are better than my favorite pair of jeans.  May they continue with many more great album compositions in the future.

I have bought 3 pairs of earbuds since I got this new Sony mp3 player about a month ago....I don't know what it is, but I think I have small openings in my ears.....as the other earbuds, caused my ears to hurt, and even was so sore, for three days I could not even touch them....but these, I don't even know they are there.....this is what I expected with the other ones, but a friend of mine told me to try these and If I didn't like them he would give me my money back plus....so what could I lose? I'm sold on them, and I'm wearing my Alabama cap over them.....roll tide!!!!! Hey! by the way I'm 67 years old, my first Mp3 player......although years ago, I bought one of the first Sony Walkman's......still have it, plays cassettes.....but these are the earphones to wear.....I'm sold even for the big hole people.........:)
B0029LHW4A|1.0|Loved the first two Jet records, this one is total crap though.  Shes A Genius and Black Hearts are both solid songs that sound like they could fit on the previous records.  The rest of the record is absolutely awful though.  The production sounds way too polished, there are basically no ballads (something Jet was always great for), and I can honestly say that this record makes Jet sound more like a Disney band than a rock band.  I havent traded in a CD for about 10 years but I think I might need to get rid of this, I would rather have the dollar or two.
0439023491|5.0|I enjoyed Catching Fire almost as much as the Hunger Games but, I felt as if there was a lacking of romantic tension that the first book oozed.  Katniss's lack of response to tip a scales in favor to either Gale or Peeta was annoying.  I love the way Suzanne Collins builds her climax with heart wrenching agony.  It leads me to believe that no happy ending awaits anyone in this story, but i can't wait to see how the author WILL overcome all the hardships they face to find a happily ever after.
1569474680|4.0|Little Face (2006) tells the chilling story of a missing baby. When Alice Fancourt returns home after her first outing since returning from the hospital she discovers that the front door is open, and realizes the baby in the nursery is not her two-week old daughter Florence. Alice's husband David, who was napping, insists that Alice is mistaken, but Alice calls the police and reports a missing baby. Simon Waterhouse, a detective constable, responds to the call and is sympathetic to Alice, but Charlie Zailer, his detective sergeant, is sure that Alice is suffering from postpartum depression and is delusional. Alice notices that David begins calling the baby \\"Little Face\\" instead of Florence, and her mother-in-law Vivienne also begins to doubt that the baby is her granddaughter. David becomes increasingly abusive of Alice, who seems unable to cope. When both Alice and the baby disappear, the police are forced to investigate, and Simon's suspicion of David deepens when he discovers some discrepancies in the investigation of the murder of David's first wife. Narrated from both the viewpoint of Alice and Simon, this dark psychological thriller is emotionally intense.<br /><br />[...]
B001RTP48G|5.0|I have been playing this PSB album for a month now. It wears very well with repeated listening. I especially like the songs \\"Pandemonium\\" and \\"Vulnerable\\". I love it when the PSBs turn a single word or short phase into a great dance song. And I love it how they enunciate every syllable.    As a warning, spend the extra money and get the double disc set that includes the extra album \\"etc.\\" which is mostly long play singles dubs of \\"Yes\\" tracks. The opening track on \\"etc.\\" is missing from \\"Yes\\" and it is the best track from both CDs. It makes every cent more for the extra worth it. \\"This used to be the future\\" is a great time spanning anthem track for those of us who started with the PSBs with their \\"Please\\" and \\"Actually\\" albums.    This PSBs album will sit well next to the classic PSBs albums of the 80's and early 90's. I highly recommend it.

B000X4GXT0|5.0|The Franco Zeffirelli production of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is by far my all time favorite version of the classic play. Staring Olivia Hussey as Juliet, this movie really captures the feel of the period and brings the story to life. The sets and costumes were simply perfect and the feast scene with the dancing and moving song is perhaps the most powerful movie memory I have from my teen years. The emotion of the movie comes through.<br /><br />We watched this with our teen daughter who wanted to try out for her senior class play. She read along and practiced the lines to get the emotions correct.<br /><br />This is a fantastic story, brought to life in a stunning movie.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0321543726|5.0|This books is by far a must have for anyone thinking about becoming a professional software developer. The books aims to address future professional software developers, and therefore can be challenging for novices, specially if you plan on doing self-study. However, it is a true eye opener of what truly programming is all about. What makes this book so good is that contrary to similar beginner's programming books, its focus is not on language details, but rather on principles and on practicing them. The are not blindly enforce to you, but rather you learn them while programming where you understand why each of them is useful and when it is most convenient to apply them. The exercises are certainly not easy but solving real world problems through programming is no easy task.<br />The books also uses plenty of color, which is also I think a welcome change (instead of using the dull gray and black fonts). This makes it easy to distinguish code from comments and from explanations. The quality the book is great and the extensive use of photographs and graphs makes it easy to read.<br />Additionally its strong emphasis on principles rather than technicalities makes this book language independent and easy to apply to C#, Java , etc (although C++ is used to in the book).

I have seen so many of these gimmick films, but this one is one of the worst. 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' is a steaming pile and makes 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' look like an Oscar winner by comparison. I actually liked The Chipmunk movie, so don't think I don't care for these goofy gimmick films. In short, the jokes are lame, the film seems way longer than it is and the idea has been done to death!

0451457994|5.0|The edition I review is the 25th Anniversary printing, which begins with a lively and highly informative introduction by Arthur C. Clarke, providing rich information on the background of the story, and stories of he and Stanley Kubrick collaborating to create the story, Stanley cooking him a steak dinner, Stanley's playfully condescending comment that Clarke's idea that the aliens somehow hated and looked down upon organic creatures to be \\"cute\\", and Stanley going to see a movie based on Clarke's recommendation, then calling Clarke afterwards to tell him he'd never watch a movie Clarke recommended again.<br /><br />It also provides very interesting insight into the writing process, and various decisions behind the differences between the book and the movie, and why they were made.  For example, the novel sets the Discovery mission as headed for Saturn, whereas Stanley moved it to Jupiter because the artists on the film could not re-create a convincing enough Saturn for him to put on screen.<br /><br />The book itself, meanwhile, is a brilliantly written, descriptive, and captivating affair.  The story is essentially the exposition and wordy explanation to what was shown to us by Kubrick's film, and the book manages to not suffer as a result of its \\"obligation\\" to be the \\"tell\\" to Kubrick's \\"show\\".<br /><br />Descriptions of Bowman and Poole's daily routine aboard the Discovery is jarring in its steadfast routine, and the fact that the men live like sentries, one man awake for much of the day, while the other sleeps, both meeting for an hour or so, then the first man sleeping while the other awakes.  There is no morning save for what consists of the morning for each individual.<br /><br />HAL's dialogue is just as succint and beautifully cold as in the film, and even his dialogue with Dave after Poole's death feels exactly like the sort of things HAL9000 would have said in the film, without feeling like either a superior or inferior representation of the computer character.<br /><br />I only have a handful of minor complaints on the book.  The most important, for me, is that much of the events are written as though in a heavily \\"wink wink, nudge nudge\\" future tense sort of thing, which is even more pervasive in the \\"Dawn of Man\\" chapters.<br /><br />For example, almost every action occurring after the Apes encounter the Monolith, Clarke embellishes their actions with something like \\"This is something that would never be seen for a million years\\" or \\"The first instance of this in all of human history\\" as though we should know all this already, and he cannot stop insisting upon the scale, chronologically and evolutionary and in importance, to a degree that the sequence does not feel as though you are there with the Apes, living in their world, but that you are in present or future times, watching the Apes from a distance.<br /><br />Thankfully after that, very few things occur in that manner beyond the scale of space objects and phenomena which gains an obligatory \\"But they would never realize what would happen next\\" sort of thing.<br /><br />Another thing isn't really a problem, but felt more like a buzzkill for me, having been so accustomed to the movie.  After Dave disconnects HAL (in which his \\"dying\\" words are far more incoherent than in the movie), he re-establishes contact with Earth, and rather than a pre-recorded message, Heywood Floyd himself informs Bowman of what was essentially revealed in the pre-recorded message of the movie.<br /><br />I disliked this sequence because despite the book being the \\"tell\\" portion, it did far too much \\"telling\\" at the total expense of showing things itself.  It was far too expository, and it felt unrealistic in how Dave Bowman could accept these facts without even a hint of disappointment that he was left out of it.<br /><br />It also felt like a bit of spoilage for the final leg of the journey---I had thought it would play far more greatly if Dave Bowman were really truly alone afterdisconnecting HAL.  And in fact, the novel does go and tell us and show us just how truly alone Dave feels after HAL's death.  And yet his ability to remain in contact with Earth spoils that for me.<br /><br />The final journey (\\"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite\\" for the movie) is almost a completely different one from the movie, and yet no less mindblowing or shockingly terrifying.  It is far more scientific than the movie, involving descriptions of what is explained to be \\"like an intergalactic Grand Central Station\\", and approaching a Double-Star system (which provided for me in a bit of Fridge Logic the realization that this was probably the aliens' inspiration for making Jupiter into a star in \\"2010\\"---giving the Solar System two stars), what is described as an intergalactic parking lot full of alien ships that had been abandoned for millions of years, and a full explanation of the reasoning behind the \\"hotel room\\" and just how Dave Bowman ended up inside of it.<br /><br />The epic scale of this last, dialogue-free sequence is so much like the movie in its impact---it radically diverts from the film's atmosphere, the same way the Dawn of Man sequence did in both film and novel, and more than makes up for my own personal disappointment at how Dave's final leg of the journey played out, with him in constant contact with Earth.<br /><br />The entirety of the book retains an epic and dramatic feel, using its descriptive words and dialogue to convey what Kubrick could do with film.  The Monoliths are also officially given their descriptive dimensions of 1x4x9 (and as stated later in the book which brought tears of awe into my eyes, \\"And how naïve to have imagined that the series ended at this point, in only three dimensions!\\")and show us just how truly alone Dave feels after HAL's death.

B001FB4W02|3.0|Someone here touted the 8th season of Smallville as \\"inventive.\\"  How so?  I've watched all the previous seven years of episodes and the first twelve of season 8 but have seen precious few new ideas, just old ones rehashed with different characters.  Clark still loses his powers, constantly runs into kryptonite (and even keeps a box in the barn for some strange reason), ends up in the Phantom Zone and inevitably releases another monster, and finds yet another survivor of Krypton.  Characters continue to get possessed by alien entities, and love affairs always fall short of success.  The pressure for Clark to develop a Superman alter identity is foolish as presented.  For seven seasons he has been the football/super hero to whom everyone turns in a time of crisis, including adults.  He has saved every Smallville damsel in distress and, while he may be a nice guy, is anything but mild-mannered.  The double image Christopher Reeve portrayed so well just isn't possible in the Smallville setting.  Worse, the show continues to strain credulity.  No, I'm not talking about super powers.  You can't watch Superman and not accept that premise.  I have trouble with impossible human timelines.  I'm weary of seeing characters beaten to a pulp and the next day bouncing around like nothing happened.  Lois ends up in the Phantom Zone and - duh! - thinks it was all a dream.  How convenient!  Just how many times can you get knocked out, possessed, or kidnapped into other-worldly environments before you lose your sanity?  And they must develop a new street set.  They've doctored that insanely curved city street six ways from Sunday, but it's still obviously the same location.  It is not that anything in the eight season is bad, it's just that I've seen it all before in one form or another.  Perhaps it's time to let Clark don the cape and tights and let Smallville fade into TV history.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|I can't say I was too impressed with this 'experiment' of an album. I am sad that Cornell became so desperate that he relied on the likes of Justin Timberlake to help boost his popularity/ sales.

If you want incredible Chris Cornell, the way it is supposed to sound, please, listen to Euphoria Morning.

0896762629|5.0|The Patterns of Fashion series is pretty much the grail of historical costuming from the Renaissance onward and this last (sadly posthumously published) book in the series actually blows the preceding three away. The focus is primarily Western and Southern European linen undergarments and accessory pieces from the period surrounding and including the Elizabethan era which have managed to survive the intervening centuries. After a brief discussion of materials, items of focus, and practices, the first half of the book is devoted to detailed photographic presentations of extant pieces with brief descriptive commentaries and similar examples from contemporary portraiture. The second half of the book revisits each of the items detailed in the first half of the book but presents them as exploded technical drawings with detailed notes on cut, construction, and embellishment.<br /><br />Since I got this book the week it came out I have been calling this \\"the crazymaking book\\" for all the incredible information it has shoved into my brain. There is so much information to digest that it has literally taken me the better part of a year to get through the whole thing. The photographic detail (in colour!) is incredible, the reference portraiture incredibly useful for mentally framing the items correctly, and the descriptions are concise and packed with information. I have learned staggering amounts of information about the materials, construction, and styles represented in this book.

0739366408|4.0|World War Z embodies the culmination of the zombie renaissance that has had widespread exposure as far back as the early 2000's with the Dawn of the Dead remake.  But Max brooks proves that you can take a vintage concept and improve upon it, rennovate it, evolve it into something that transcends its silly roots and becomes satirical, terrifying and sophisticated.  WWZ makes The Zombie Survival Guide--a work of humorous \\"nonfiction\\" that in its own right seemed like a watershed moment--look like nothing more than the preamble, the laying of the foundation stones.  WWZ has the feeling of what Max Brooks was possibly aiming at all along, the final phase in his glorious plan to give the world something beautifully absurd and expertly devised.  Max Brooks is, for lack of a better term, a mad genius.  Mad props to the man.    In nothing else I've ever read (save maybe Steven Pressfield's \\"Gates of Fire\\") have I seen one author so well accomplish his goals across the board.  There is hardly a misstep, hardly a low point or boring portion of any chapter or track.  Each story resonates in its way, whether that be transmitting terror, anxiety, rage, indignation, humor, sentimentality, sympathy, compassion, nostalgia, intrigue, patriotism, gung ho badassery, sarcasm, satire or just plain fun at reveling in a shlocky genre.  Max Brooks' protean talent as a writer, technical researcher, dramatist, satirist and overall creative professional is uncanny.    But for a detailed review of the novel itself, check out any of the other hundreds of reviews.  This review is for the AUDIO CD's presentation.    In short, it's great but not perfect.  The cast is a parade of talent from Carl Reiner and Henry Rollins to Alan Alda and noted accomplished voice actor Mark Hamill.  And there's where it, for me, took a turn for the ironic.  I'm familiar with mark Hamill's voice work and it's usually a success, but his rendition of Todd, the US Army veteran, seemed off kilter.  I attribute this to itbeing simply different than the version I had of Todd in my head when reading WWZ before the audio CD came out and not through any real fault of Mark Hamill's (all about interpretation).  Sometimes the version others invision is better than the ones in our minds.  Sometimes it's not.  This was not one of those times.  There's nothing wrong with Mark Hamill's performance, per se, I just liked mine more.  I suspect others shared this sentiment about various other portions of WWZ's audio book.  In another bout of irony, perhaps the consistently best performance (for me) is from none other than Max Brooks himself (though others would argue the opposite).  He's definitely inherited his father's acting talent (in truth, I'm kind of scared of the guy; is there anything he sucks at?).    Here are some highlights:    Henry Rollins' role as the mercenary is outstanding.  Audibly, Rollins wears the skin of a hired gun well, exuding aggression.  And his visual style definitely supplements the merc aesthetic (for those who know what he looks like).    The story of the downed pilot fighting for survival alone with only her radio has, for some reason, always seemed like the backbone of the novel to me.  It emotionally resonates; it inexplicably moves me, perhaps because it encapsulates so much of what WWZ strives to accomplish; a real microcosm of the entire work (pain, heroism, terror, loneliness, action, etc).    All of Todd's stories are fun but especially the later versions, once the US military reinvents itself.  There is so much retro innovation that you can't help but marvel at the ingenuity and research involved.    The girl whose family drives up to Canada is such a touching moment of quiet tenderness amidst the horrors of what transpire that--again--it's hard not to be taken aback by the voice talent.  It represents a strangely serene respite from most of the more action oriented set pieces that zip past, all the while remaining a chilling reminder of the dark side of human nature when trapped in exigency (plus CANNIBALISM!).    Anything to do with the US President is interesting because it puts on display what iconic leadership should look like and the ideals that are required to step up in crises.    The story involving the Queen of England remains one of the most poignant of the lot, aided by a stereotypical British accent but one that is rich and textured and full (let's face it, when are those not fun to listen to?).  The imagery of the tale is real nerd fodder, too: castles, claymores, royalty.  I confess that it appealed to me on a base level.    As for the low points:    Some of the shorter stories lack resonance to the point that I can't recall enough about them to review.  But they're there.  They won't make you cringe, but they're not as salient as the rest.    There are musical intros/outtros that punctuate the movements in the audio CD, accentuating the breaks in \\"parts\\" that the written novel contained.  It's a good concept that I think is flawed in this version simply by underdeveloped musical stylings; sort of one-note synth drones that fall flat.  I understand the understated tension that this is supposed to mirror but the production itself seemed on the cheap end.    It might be considered a misstep to not have the story about the feral girl who could mimic the zombie growl, but I could see that being something that would be too daunting a task to replicate, sort of like revealing the monster.  You don't want to show your hand or drag that fetish from the shadows; the mystery gives it power and to reveal any part of the zombies like that is to diminish it.  So I concede why it was left out, but it still could've been fun.    Some of the stories that didn't make it (for whatever reason) should've been there though, the Russian decimations being the most prominent in my mind.  I realize that WWZ is by no means a laconic book.  There are a slew of unnecessary anecdotes and tales in the manuscript that do little morethan add to the flavor of the text--but that's great!  This was such a remarkable novel to begin with that in this rare case more is better.  So for me, dropping anymore than just a couple stories seems like a wasted opportunity.  I don't think there's hope for a truly unabridged version but it's just one more reason to buy the book; you'd be short-changing yourself otherwise.    However, those complaints aside, WWZ's audio CD is a master stroke of solid writing, technical knowledge, creative skill, idealism, political intrigue, gory violence, social outrage, exorcisms of fears, commentary and unparalleled FUN.  More than anything, though, that's something you'll notice: Max Brooks and the audio book's cast are having a lot of fun with WWZ, and the vibe is infectious.    Whether it be used or new, CD or paperback, World War Z is worth your time.  Its incremental nature and articulate prose make it engaging and entertaining without being laborious.  It bares its fangs while running a gamut of emotions.  And the audio CD, though truncated and occasionally misguided in acting, is a phenomenal example of what can be accomplished when you marry an iconic genre, fresh ideas, sapient knowledge, and lack of pretention with satire.

The glowing and detailed descriptions of this recording are well-deserved.  The Boston Symphony plays with a precision and verve that make other fine versions sound almost sloppy by comparison.  I am tempted to imagine that if Fritz Reiner had recorded this with the Chicago Symphony, the interpretation would have resembled Steinberg's.  This is my favorite performance of this work, in a class by itself, but one caveat about the recording of the CD is in order.  The digital transfers (I have 2 incarnations of it) do not match the quality of the vinyl original.  In direct A-B comparison, it is immediately clear that the LP captures much more detail in the inner voicings that make this such a distinctive recording.  The LP projects a broader soundstage and better imaging than the CD as well.    Having said all this, if you're a \\"Planets\\" fan, you owe it to yourself to hear this performance.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|How does one define the undefinable?  This is the best series ever to hit television.  Alan Ball, Charlaine Harris, cast and crew of True Blood are all top notch in their craft. The actors are beautiful, the music is original and all involved in making this series are commited to excellence. If you haven't become addicted to True Blood you are missing out on an exciting and satisfying experience in audio and video enjoyment. True Blood is simply the best.

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|I have to say this is a very good and a very Tarantino film...from the mispelled title to the quirky subtitles in French when the characters are speaking French...Very Funny QT. I am writing this review to express my exhaustion of having to make up and finish the back stories by myslef. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** where did Aldo get that whole-another-character-of-a-scar? how did Shoshanna become Emmanuelle? did Landa know about Emmanulle/Shoshanna or not? OK you win I'll just have to watch the film again if not for the answers but for just pure enjoyment of a good laugh.
B000J10EQU|3.0|In the Summer of 2006, nearly twenty years after Superman last soared across movie screens, the much-delayed, much hyped &#34;Superman Returns&#34; premiered to mostly positive feedback from moviegoers and better-than-average acclaim from film critics.  Yet, despite racking up an astronomical total of nearly $400 million dollars worldwide in box office receipts, the movie was still deemed a relative failure, and, as of this date, shockingly enough, a sequel isn't even on the horizon yet.  Why, one wonders?  The pieces for a successful update of the beloved Superman film franchise were seemingly all there: a relatively solid cast (including Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor); a virtually limitless special effects budget; the classic score by John Williams; and, most importantly, a truly sincere appreciation for Richard Donner's original films starring Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman from 1978 and 1981.  Yet, like some puzzles, this film's pieces simply didn't all fit because they were put in the wrong order.  For that very reason, &#34;Superman Returns&#34; could have and should have been better than the finished product.<br /><br />In terms of the storyline, director Bryan Singer and his co-screenwriters lovingly reference the original Donner films repeatedly, including never-before-seen footage of the late Marlon Brando as Jor-El.  As much as I enjoyed these generous helpings of nostalgia, the recurring problem is that this film completely lacks the romantic exuberance and playful charm that Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder had previously embued.  Instead, good-natured charm is replaced here by some surprisingly dark scenes of violence (inappropriate for young viewers, I might add).  Considering that &#34;Superman Returns&#34; clocks in at roughly two and a half hours, the absence of any tongue-in-cheek comic relief is mind-boggling, and, as a result, the film really sags at times.  Further, Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor needs to take an originality pill, as his latest land grab scheme seems nothing more than a more intense reworking of Gene Hackman's original Luthor.  Aside from Luthor, a new villain like Brainiac or even Doomsday would have made more sense to avoid criticism that this film borrows too often from the Donner films.<br /><br />Second, while Kevin Spacey is no doubt a perfect choice as Lex Luthor, he isn't able to carry this movie alone.  Romantic leads Brandon Routh (as Superman/Clark Kent) and Kate Bosworth (as Lois Lane) aren't able to muster any magical chemistry together despite their best efforts.  Routh is passable as the Man of Steel, and, if a sequel is ever made, he deserves another chance to improve upon his performance, which simply lacks the timeless charisma and depth Reeve had brought to the role.  As for Bosworth, she is a solid actress, but she is completely miscast here.  Singer's miscalculation casting Bosworth isn't nearly as bad as hapless Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist next to Pierce Brosnan's 007 ten years ago, but it still ranks about the same as Katie Holmes' forgettable performance as an Assistant DA in &#34;Batman Begins,&#34; in 2005.<br /><br />However, &#34;Superman Returns&#34; has a strong supporting cast of James Marsden, Frank Langella, Parker Posey, Eva Marie Saint, and Sam Huntington, in addition to cameos from Jack Larson, Noel Neill, and, of course, Marlon Brando.  Also, the young actor playing Lois' young son does an excellent job, although his character's presence is rather unsettling when one considers who his father turns out to be (a subtle hint about &#34;Superman II.&#34;)  Speaking of which, I'll give Bryan Singer credit for coming up with at least one original plot twist, but the romantic love triangle between Routh, Bosworth, and Marsden should have been permanently resolved by the film's end.  Instead, the film's conclusion, unfortunately, is rather unsatisfying after well over two hours building up to it.<br /><br />Third and lastly, the film's production design and special effects are, no question, simply awesome (countless millions of dollars will do that).  However, Singer, I think, again miscalculated by relying far too much on computer-generated effects (sometimes, they are incredibly obvious), because it feels often like one is watching a video game's graphics.  Further, Routh often seems indistinguishable from his CGI counterpart, and I'm afraid that's not a compliment because his expressionless face doesn't convey that it's really him flying.  Make no mistake: Christopher Reeve made his flying sequences exhilarating fun because you could actually see his facial expressions clearly enough to make one believe in the fantasy that he really is flying.  Routh, in comparison, instead looks more like another special effect.<br /><br />Despite all of the nostalgic joy I felt hearing John Williams' familiar score (not to mention, the ghostly echoes of Marlon Brando's distinctive voice) once more, I think &#34;Superman Returns&#34; ultimately missed a wonderful opportunity to send the Man of Steel soaring into the 21st Century.  This movie simply forgot to borrow the one vital element the 1978 Donner film possessed more than anything else: charming, adventurous fun with a classy sense of humor.  Nonetheless, despite its flaws, &#34;Superman Returns&#34; is still well worth seeing for the loving homage to Christopher Reeve's memory, and to ours of him as the timeless Man of Steel.<br /><br />Rating: a strong 3/5. (Please think twice before letting pre-teenagers watch this movie).uestion, simply awesome (countless millions of dollars will do that).

B00260HH3K|1.0|So as most Dragon Ball fans I went into the theaters excited to see a movie based on a show I watched since I was a kid.... Disappointment...that is the only word I need to use when describing this movie... At first I thought ok they are making this a little futuristic. I can deal with that. But if I remember correctly...please correct me if I am wrong...Goku did not learn to drive until much later. His grandpa died before Goku became a teenager...and I dont remember ever going to school. He was oblivious to it all. And yet they gave Picolo a side kick?! #@%^@# I stayed for about 45 mins of the movie and then left. Horrid. Horrid. Horrid!!!! Way to go FOX... way to jack up yet another classic story... my child is now a black hole of nothing...never to get it back because you sucked it out....thanks...
B001AQTWF2|5.0|It puzzles me how everyone is a psychoanalyst all of a sudden.  Amazon is only asking you to rate the product not the person.  With that said, this is a wonderful CD of music, in my opinion.  There isn't a bad song in the bunch.  True, you will not hear the soaring vocals of the past, but we like to move forward and hope with time, her powerhouse vocals will return.  The voice and the delivery are still there.  Since I am not certified psychologist, I will only rate the album.    Here's a breakdown track by track of the album, not Whitney.    1.  Million Dollar Bill - Nice catchy tune  2.  Nothin' But Love - MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE--nice tune, powerful vocals.  3.  Call You Tonight - I love this song... She is really putting her all into this track.  4.  I Look To You - The most well written song on the CD.  Whitney is BACK!  5.  A Song For You - Starts off slow, but then watch out... Reminiscence of I'm Every Woman.  6.  Like I Never Left - Akon and Whitney sound great; this has a nice Caribbean beat to it.       Both of their vocals are blend together great.  7.  I Didn't Know My Own Strength - I must admit that this one had to grow on me.  However, after      listening to the message, I had to change my opinion.  This song has some powerful lyrics.   8.  Worth It - Very current song, she sounds great.  9.  For The Lovers - Nice club song... SING  10. I Got You - Another Gem! - Whitney and Akon should do an entire album. GOOD LYRICS  11. Salute - Single potential.  Nice lyrics.  I love the sassiness in her delivery.    Overall this is a nice return for Whitney, with no rap fill in at all... THANKS
B0009LNRLE|5.0|This is the record that Julian Cope gushed was the best album to come out of the KRAUTROCK movement. I personally cant concur, but its certainly one of the greatest albums from that 1969-1977 classic KRAUTROCK period. YETI is Amon Duul II's second album, and seems to be the point where the band was most closely united inside a musical psychedelic transcendence. After YETI, personal changes started to affect the band, making them sound sold out and stale, after VIVA LA TRANCE. But they really had something wild going on for their YETI double album. (The CD runs about 73 minutes long, including two songs that AMAZON dont list--RATTLESNAKEPLUMCAKE and BETWEEN THE EYES...the A and B side of a single that was released about this time.) This bands truly unique sound stems from their song structures, which meander around, returning to recognizable leitmotifs periodically, especially on their LONG composistions, like \\"Soap Shop Rock\\". Everything about this music SCREAMS Psychedelia, right down to the titles of some of the songs. \\"SANDOZ IN THE RAIN\\" (an improv song stuck at the end of the album) refers to the Swiss pharmeceutical company that first produced LSD. But its the wild chaos of the instruments, the drums, the crazy lyrics (in english of course), and the male and female singers, that really make this music take off.  Some people compare their sound to Jefferson Airplane or even Velvet Underground, but the analogy only extends to the bands all using both a male and female singer. AMON DUUL's sound is more atonal than MOST of the Jefferson Airplane material, with none of the Airplane's \\"folk\\" backround in their songs. The VU comparison comes from the flipped out violin solos that pop up now and then. (It does remind you of the atonal chaos of a good John Cale solo ala 1968.) But the guitars are almost ALWAYS electric, and ALWAYS turned up loud, providing a distorted, overdriven haze to their sound. A beautiful exception is CERBERUS, an instrumental acoustic piece, that has acoustic guitar leads weaving in and out of a sonic miasma of bongos, bass, and vocalizations. Then it turns electric for no good reason, reinforcing the chaos that permeates the album's core sound.<br />Renate, the female singer, loves singing slightly out of key, giving her voice a \\"dark\\", keening sound, with melodic shapes that jump up and down randomly on the soundscape. When she's singing like that, with those strange guitar solos occuring concurrently, the colors bleed into a dense, deep sonic overload.  YETI was recorded in 1970, after their first album, 1969's \\"PHALLUS DEI\\" nearly single handedly started the Krautrock movement. Like the Grateful Dead's short commune period at Haight st, AMON DUUL also arose from a hippie commune, with left wing political ideologies. (AMON DUUL \\"1\\", the more political arm of the commune, also put out several less musical albums. Amon Duul 1's music is hard to get into. They sound like Zappa's HELP I\\"M A ROCK, for album after album.) So if you can handle some freaky, free and funky musical experiments that definately arose from the use of spiked sugar cubes, and enjoy EARLY Pink Floyd, mixed with Jefferson Airplane's electric freak outs from AFTER BATHING AT BAXTERS, then YETI is a safe bet. If calling the album KRAUTROCK brings up visions of drum machines, and KRAFTWERK's electronic new wave sound, or Tangerine Dreams long, ambient synthesizer experiments, DONT WORRY. More than other KRAUTROCK bands, AMON DUUL's first 3 albums are FLUID ACID ROCK, far from the pop psychedelia of other less adventurous bands exploring that style. Still, Amon Duul II's YETI is unique, unlike anything you might have heard from LONDON's or SAN FRANSISCO's acid rock jam bands from that era.  That's what makes Yeti's sound such a fun surprise when you start to groove into it.at has acoustic guitar leads weaving in and out of a sonic miasma of bongos, bass, and vocalizations.

B000B8IA2G|5.0|Stargate Atlantis seems destined to follow Deep Space Nine in terms of the middle child of sci-fi franchises.  Never particularly famous, and not particularly loved, except the \\"hardcore\\" fans who will swear it is better than the show from where is spawned.  While I'm sure I'll get plenty of angry comments, I am the hardcore fan who prefers atlantis to SG1.  Why?  Well, Atlantis starts very different from SG1.  For starters, the first season is largely about them learning to understand and adapt to Atlantis, on their own with no help from earth.  They are alone and dealing with a completely new enemy, the awesome Wraith, as well as a few equally evil humans, the Geni.  This feeling of being completely on their own with everything feeling new lends creedence to the \\"explorer\\" theme of stargate far better.  While I love SG1, I would get tired of the Asgard saving them all the time.  Atlantis has atlantis and themselves, and must make do.     Better yet, this show truly takes from the classic sci-fi of olden days.  Not just the political references, but the stories that you don't see coming from a mile away (well mostly), with interesting twists, and similarly building the characters and stories along the way.        Best of all, the show is just a lot of fun.  I can watch Sheppard and McKay banter all day long.  Frankly, in terms of scientist characters, McKay is easily my favorite of all sci-fi.  He may be a bit of jerk, but his performance is likeably and fun enough to warrant you truly liking the character.  Anyway, I've said too much, but I highly recomend you give this show a try if you haven't the first season sets a great precedent, and is one of the more entertaining shows you'll see.

Actually, the movie did fairly well in this regard.  However, as the movie wore on, I found myself naturally drawn to one story more than the other (ie the modern Julia story) and as a result had more affection for that character and in the end was disappointed when the other Julia ended up coming off as a narcissistic buffoon (my interpretation).<br /><br />2.  Anyway, a decent movie, definitely worth renting on DVD, however nothing more.

0439023491|5.0|Catching fire is fantastic. Katniss and Peeta show more character and maturity after their win and envelope you in their lives back in their district.  The love triangle is more present although reality, like in our real life, doesn't deviate the characters from their purpose and it's clear that humanity is a main theme throughout the 2nd book as well.  They're defiant but determined and bonds are formed that remind everyone of the brutality and aloofness of the Capital.  Even though the Capital is resembled as a blood thirsty abode of Games lovers, further disruption is inevitable as Katniss and Peeta once again steal the spotlight and their `love' shines bright and concise, shredding through allegiances and instilling hope.<br />This is a YA book but I'm in my mid 20's and recommend this book to any experienced reader just for comparisons sake.  Suzanne Collins' gift as a writer transcends ages.

Alex's written comment in Brittany's notebook was comical and original.  That kept me reading it until the end.

B00005JLD4|5.0|This is a harrowing tale of three little girls who were ripped away from their mothers and their long journey home. In the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Molly, Grace, and Daisy who are being taught to hunt and live off the land by their Aboriginal Mothers. The Mothers warn the girls to hide when they see a white officer arrive. The girls have to hide because they were half white and half aboriginal, or as they are called in the movie \\"half-caste\\".     In 1905 The Aborigines Act was passed. \\"Under this law, the Chief Protector is made the legal guardian of every Aboriginal and 'half-caste' child under 16 years old\\" ([...]). In the movie the Chief Protector, A.O. Neville, uses his power to remove any half-caste child from their families. He honestly thinks he is helping the children by doing this. The way he sees it, he is providing them food, shelter, schooling, and a path to God or at least his version thereof. He fails to recognize the Aboriginal way of spirituality as an alternative. The Aborigines people on the other hand don't mind the presence of the white man and seem to get along just fine with them as long as they don't interfere. The missionaries' lack of understanding different religious cultures is to their detriment as Molly displays courage in running away from the compound with her sister and cousin and adeptness at surviving in the harsh conditions they face on their journey to find the Rabbit Proof Fence and home. She is able to elude capture utilizing skills she learned from her people, the Aboriginal people, skills that serve her well and connected her with the earth and her spiritual side. Molly's ability left even Mr. Neville acknowledging that she was a clever girl.    I was shocked to learn that Australia had such a similar repressive history when compared to the rest of the world. I had no idea that slavery existed there nor that they had laws allowing half white children to be ripped from their families, some even as babies. Onthe other hand I was moved by Molly's determination to get home despite the circumstances. The girls walked in the same clothing and shoes for 9 weeks, drinking from grass wells in the desert, sleeping on dirt, eating what they could find and what was offered by strangers. I think many people today would give up in the face of such harsh circumstances, but these girls pressed on. It just shows you what will, wits and determination can get you in life. I came away from this movie with a new appreciation for my comforts at home.

B000W1V7K4|4.0|In 2001, director Steven Soderbergh brought us the re-imagining of the Rat Pack classic \\"Ocean's Eleven\\", and then in 2004, he followed it up with the not nearly as entertaining sequel \\"Ocean's Twelve\\". Three years later Soderbergh, and most of his original cast from the previous two films, returned one more time for \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\". For a franchise that has seen one great movie and one not-so great in its franchise's relatively short existence, one must wonder how the third effort will turn out. Will \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" bring back the fun and excitement of the first film, or continue to falter under its own self-importance as \\"Ocean's Twelve\\" did?    \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" begins with a member of Danny's crew being swindled out of a share of profits in a new Las Vegas hotel by a nefarious businessman named Willy Bank (Al Pacino). Now, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and company want retribution for their deceived comrade, but to succeed they will have to pull off their most daring job yet.    Screenwriting duo Brian Koppelman and David Levien (\\"Knockaround Guys\\") bring back to the \\"Ocean's\\" franchise something that had been sorely missed in its second outing... all of the fun. This time around, not only is the script much more in the vein of the first film, but the entertainment value is nearly as high as it was the first go-round. With the clever comebacks, the wit, and an overall feel good atmosphere, none of which ever decreased the interesting and entertaining nature of \\"Ocean's Eleven\\", this latest installment brings the series back from the doldrums that ensnared it throughout the lesser-entertaining \\"Ocean's Twelve\\".    While the fun of the series has been revived that is not to say that this movie is lacking in any sort of drama. The story for \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is the most intimate the series has ever been. By placing the Ocean's crew in a position where one of theirs has been wronged and thus their newest job is driven purely by retribution from the get-go creates a fresh, new twist for what could have been an all-too familiar tale. One other aspect of this film's story that one will notice when watching the movie is that there appears to be a sense of finality to the series' various character arcs. I have heard that this is intended to be the final film in the franchise, at least with this cast, and if so, I appreciate the efforts made in the screenplay to bring resolution to not only the characters, but also the various plot threads that have existed since the first film. If this is indeed the final chapter for Danny Ocean and his crew, then this was a very satisfying and enjoyable ending to the series.    Reprising their roles from the previous two films are essentially everybody that we have become familiar with since 2001; however, Julia Roberts and previous newcomer Catherine Zeta-Jones are noticeably absent from the proceedings. Aside from those two missing assets, everyone else is back, and arguably better than ever. I was especially pleased to discover that the fast-paced repartee amongst the characters, primarily between Danny (George Clooney) and Rusty (Brad Pitt), was back in full force, and just as fluid and smartly crafted as before.    From my perspective as a fan of the series, despite the low point of \\"Ocean's Twelve\\", one of the highlights in the cast has remained Matt Damon's character of Linus. Damon's portrayal of Linus has evolved naturally over the course of the previous two films, culminating in this one with the audience finally getting to see Linus in a capacity that rivals Danny or Rusty in terms of respect, usefulness, and skill. Another highlight of the cast would be Carl Reiner who had been somewhat under-utilized in the previous two films; this time around he is given much more to do with his character. His comedic timing and immersion into the character is great, and he proves that even at his age he can easily keep up with his much younger co-stars.    Of course, when discussing the castof \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" one would be remiss not to mention the terrific performances from the two newcomers to the series, Al Pacino (\\"The Godfather\\") and Ellen Barkin (\\"Sea of Love\\"). These two enduring talents are extremely fun to watch in this film as both clearly appear to be enjoying themselves on camera. Ellen Barkin is perfect in the role of the seductive assistant to Al's Willy Bank character. Ellen takes a character that should have been a fairly one-dimensional role and turned her into a complex, modern woman who is nearly as ruthless as her boss.    However, it was Al Pacino's performance that was the most surprising to me. I know it sounds strange to say that Al Pacino gave a surprising performance, I mean let's face it the guy is a legend, but it's because of how low-key he was in this role when compared to some of his work from the last 10 to 15 years that I can say that. Here's an actor that has become heavily parodied by today's comedians because of his penchant for yelling his lines at random, and yet, in this film I can hardly recall a single instance where he really cut loose with the volume. Along with his reserved performance, Pacino delivers a character in Willy Bank that is so slimy, distrustful, and utterly narcissistic that you instantly hate him, but at the same time there's something about the role that is flat-out entertaining. Honestly, Al's portrayal of Willy Bank in \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is some of the best work he's done of late and is vastly superior to his less-than-stellar performances in \\"Righteous Kill\\" and \\"88 Minutes\\".    \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is an incredibly fun heist movie that brings the trilogy full circle, wrapping up the various threads in a very satisfying manner. Although not quite as good as the first film in the series, \\"Thirteen\\" is a very close second and more than makes up for the shortcomings of its predecessor.    \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" is rated PG-13 for language.
0439023483|5.0|In a world where one government rules over all others, saving the best for themselves and taking all but \\"not enough\\" from the other districts, The Hunger Games are an annual event that is hated and celebrated.  In this scary future, people starve to death all the time and each year two people per district are offered up to participate in the \\"games\\".  All but one will die and the survivor will never go hungry again.<br /><br />Scary but real, a gripping glimpse into a future our society could one day go and is more than halfway there.  While thousands, maybe millions starve, the Capitol crowd overeats, dresses extravangantly, and entertains themselves with the unlucky ones.  Creating unfair games that pit them at each other, dangle food in front of them, and offer creative deaths.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down.  It was the first time in a long time that I stayed up all night finishing a book.  While it is somewhat predictable (which is a given seeing as it is written in first person from a competitor's pov), everything else is original and unpredictable enough to make up for it.  I wasn't aware it was the first of three until I finished it, then was super excited to realize it was and grabbed Catching Fire up immediately.  Highly recommended for all, something everyone will enjoy and appreciate!

B00288KNLS|3.0|This movie is totally awesome.  Very imaginative, good classic story, and wonderful cinematography.  The look of this movie is as awesome as the way they made it, check out the special features. Really cool.  The reason I gave this product 3 stars was because the 3D version is not so great.  The glasses aer the old 2 color glasses and my eyes, and others who have watched it, never quite adjusted all the way.  The 3D became distracting actually.  In the movie theater the 3D was amazing!!! I was blown away by its awesomeness!  But the transition to home 3D is not quite there yet.  But still an awesome movie.  I'd suggest just buying the regular version of the movie, its kinda \\"3D ish\\" anyway.
1400079276|5.0|what a very complex concept, set in a complex environment but he's such a good writer that it really allows even the simplest of thinkers to identify well with the characters.  There are consistent themes of love, lust, wonderment and a sense of belonging.  Seriously,  it's like it was written just for me. I struggle so deeply and much of kafka's troubles in dealing with the past almost help me see things differently in my life.  even though the story twists around the idea of the oedipal complex, i feel like it was way beyond that into the intangible and into the sea of emotion and memories.  dreaming for me has also been a lot more profound.  the thoughts you are left with after reading this book are stuck with you for days moving into your sleep, just thinking and thinking about life and everything!  my dreams are waking, but not as they used to be.  I can't describe it really, but this story has touched me very deeply    this was my first time reading murakami and I couldn't put this book down from the moment I started reading it.    not even the same idea, really. he's such a fantastic writer and thinker, I want to read everything he's ever written.
B001VS46DC|5.0|If you love the latin beat and love Antonio Carlos Jobim, then you will love Diana Krall's very jazzy interpretation of this wonderful music!  Her soft, sexy voice mingles with her excellent talents as a jazz piano artist in front of a live, very appreciative audience in Rio.  Diana's bossa nova style gives a jazzy new twist to many old classics.  However, Krall gets her greatest applause when she sings Jobim's Quiet Nights and The Boy From Ipanema, as well as Este Seu Olhar with the audience joining her in singing this beautiful song. If you want to spend 135 minutes of pure joy, buy this great DVD.  I also have the CD and enjoy the soft sounds of Krall while driving along the highways and byways.  Sooo soothing!  Muy Bueno!
B000005J56|5.0|Awesome Album    The Buena Vista Social Club was a members club in Havana, Cuba that held dances and musical activities, becoming a popular location for musicians to meet and play during the 1940s. In the 1990s, nearly 50 years after the club was closed, it inspired a recording made by Cuban musician Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder with traditional Cuban musicians, some of whom were veterans who had performed at the club during the height of its popularity.    The recording, named Buena Vista Social Club after the Havana institution, became an international success, and the ensemble was encouraged to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film, followed by a second concert in Carnegie Hall, New York City for a documentary that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders's film, also called Buena Vista Social Club, was released to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards.    The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of international interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with international stars from different musical genres. The \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \\"musical golden age\\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.

B00005JLD4|5.0|OK, all the reviews are out dissing parts of this film, and praising others. I'm gonna put it simple, you must see this film. It's simple, the film is well made, has a great story, and makes you feel for the characters. Isn't that the point of going to a movie, is to feel something...happy, sad, joy, love, and all those things that make us human. And to top it off, this film tells a tale of right and wrong in the world, and how someone can overcome that injustice.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Great movie....kind of old which makes some parts kind of funny but, all in all, great !
B001AQTWF2|4.0|First of, it's nice to see Whitney looking in fine shape. For those of us who have seen her live on GMA, the comeback does not seem to be in fine form. She sounded off, which I blame on her being overwhelmed as she was very emotional. Future live performances will hopefully attest to this, and we should be able to listen to her fine vocal instrument. Now that this is out of the way, here is my review.    Her voice is a little different. There is more of a rasp, which is not bad either. She fits right in with Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand, Mariah Carey... After years of singing, one's voice changes and looses its original texture. Anyway, even with a little rasp, she still can hold her own quite well.     MILLION DOLLAR BILL: Great song written partially by Alicia Keys (it sounds like something she would do) with a very catchy tune. It reminds me a little of some of Janet Jackson's tune from her ALL FOR YOU CD. Anyway, it is good track that grows on you. (8/10)    NOTHIN' BUT LOVE: Better than a mere filler. I refer to it as \\"good driving music\\". (7/10)    CALL YOU TONIGHT: Nice R&B track. Reminiscent of \\"My Heart Is Calling\\" from Preacher's Wife soundtrack. (7/10)    I LOOK TO YOU: this song has grown on me. Not the soaring Whitney Houston vocals as I would have liked, but very well interpreted. One of the songs written by R. Kelly, which is one of my favorites on the CD. (9/10)    LIKE I NEVER LEFT: a duet with Akon. This track is nice, and may find an audience in her new, younger audience. Nice, breathy tune. (8/10)    A SONG FOR YOU: I was very surprised by this song. I had heard the snippet listed here, and I was not impressed. Granted, doing a better version than D. Hathaway is no small feat. I thought that the beginning fell flat...only to realize that it was purposefully done so insofar as the track takes off at 1:25 to morph itself into a club anthem. Very well done, in my opinion, in the same fiber as the remix for \\"I Will Always Love You\\" on her \\"greatesthits\\" 2-CD set. (8/10)    I DIDN'T KNOW MY OWN STRENGTH: This song got great reviews. Not a bad song, but not my favorite ones. The vocals are quite restrained, which may have been the goal. (7/10)    WORTH IT: The intro reminds me of the ill-fated \\"Bye, Bye\\" and the song in general reminds of some of Mariah Carey's songs on her \\"E=MC²\\" release. Another good \\"driving music\\". (7/10)    FOR THE LOVERS: this one is OK. At first, it felt like a filler. A good beat sets in with the chorus. A nice pop tune.(7/10)    I GOT YOU: For some reason, this song reminds me of some other MC songs. The vocals here remind me a little of MJ Blige. (7/10)    SALUTE: this is the second R. Kelly song on the album, and the last one. I like the lyrics. Reminiscent a little of HALO by Beyonce, yet it sounds original somehow. Good track. (7/10)    Overall, a solid release. Just don't expect the Whitney you knew in the 80s. Her voice is a little different, but the songs fit its newer, slightly raspier quality. Overall, if you're a long-time fan, you will like it. If you're new to her music, you will like it. For those of you who expect Whitney Houston from 1986-1992, you may only find a glimpse of it here...partially because this is her evolution, and (with no intent on being smart) because this is 2009. A good return for the diva who tells you her story as she sees it that has spanned the past 9 years of her life.
0439023491|4.0|This book starts out several months after \\"Hunger Games\\" ended.  I loved \\"Hunger Games\\", but felt like parts of \\"Catching Fire\\" went too fast.  Large chunks of time are completely skipped over.  Apparently nothing really changes in those time frames, but it just felt a little rushed from time to time.  At the exact same time, the beginning started out a little slow.  \\"The calm before the storm\\".  There are some really sweet moments in the book, some very funny moments in the book, and some times that I couldn't help myself, I cried.  Mainly I felt like this book prepared me for the third book.  It doesn't stand alone very well.  But it was fun to see the characters that I love. And I am dying to know what comes next.  I think Suzanne Collins did a great job of setting things up, and has made it painfully difficult to wait for the next one.  If you thought \\"Hunger Games\\" ended with a cliff hanger, you haven't seen anything yet.  I highly recommend this book if you liked \\"Hunger Games\\".
0792163710|5.0|Filmmaker George Stevens' ([[ASIN:B00003CXBZ A Place in the Sun]]) meticulous mastery over the cinematic medium has never been more present than in this 1953 classic, a film that managed to reinvigorate the then-tired Western genre thanks to the director's stunning sense of composition and his sure hand with an excellent cast. Haunted by his traumatizing experience heading up a combat motion picture unit during World War II, Stevens made far more sober, serious-minded films afterward that focused on the plights of society's outsiders. This time, the outsider is primarily the eponymous gunman, but that sense of personal isolation is felt one way or another by every principal character in the film. Written by A.B. Guthrie Jr. and inspired by the infamous Johnson County War (which also inspired Michael Cimino's infamous disaster, [[ASIN:0792843584 Heaven's Gate]]), the story unwinds slowly as a reformed gunslinger stumbles upon a resolute conflict between peace-loving \\"sodbusters\\" and threatening cattle ranchers in 1870's Wyoming. Tensions escalate when Shane's bloody past comes back to haunt him as he defends the homesteaders, in particular, the Starrett family.<br /><br />Shane becomes close to the family, especially the young son Joey who worships him as the hero figure that his father cannot seem to be. Complicating matters is corrupt cattle baron Rufus Ryker, who wants to rid the valley of the farming families to allow his cattle to roam free. When Ryder recruits a ruthless outlaw named Jack Wilson to instill fear into the farmers, it forces a showdown with the inevitable consequences. For a western, there is one major fist fight and surprisingly little gunplay; however, the impact of those events has strict dramatic purpose and brings a pervasive sense of mortality to this oft-told story. Character actor Van Heflin ([[ASIN:B00005B1Y0 Airport]]) is often overlooked in reviews of this picture, yet he effectively provides the film's sometimes precarious backbone as Joe Starrett, the moral compass for the homesteaders. In her last big-screen role, Jean Arthur brings a subtle poignancy with only a hint of her past scintillating charm as his wife Marian. Stevens coaxed the 51-year-old Arthur to make the film after a five-year absence from the screen, and she slips easily into the painterly backdrop emerging almost fleetingly as a conflicted woman with an unspoken affection for Shane.<br /><br />Much more demonstrative in his love for the gunslinger is ten-year-old Brandon De Wilde, who gives an indelibly memorable performance as Joey. In one of his earliest roles, Jack Palance barely has any dialogue or screen time for that matter, but he makes every menacing moment count as Wilson. Nevertheless, it is the underrated Alan Ladd ([[ASIN:B00023P4II This Gun For Hire]]) who brings the picture together with a superbly rendered performance in the taciturn title role. Known unfairly for his misperceived diminutive stature (he was actually 5'6\\"), the actor vividly captures Shane's sense of honor and remorse with a barely concealable fury. You will likely recognize Ben Johnson ([[ASIN:0767827902 The Last Picture Show]]), Edgar Buchanan ([[ASIN:B001E6JC30 Petticoat Junction]]), Ellen Corby ([[ASIN:B001E549KC The Waltons]]), and Elisha Cook Jr. ([[ASIN:B000GIXLW0 The Maltese Falcon]]) in smaller parts.

0307266303|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read this book ASAP! This is not just a great \\"running\\" book, it's a great book period! Even those that don't run will find this book interesting. It's well written, educational, entertaining and motivational. I did not want to put this book down but I paced myself because I did not want it to end. I got into the habit of reading a bit and then going for a run. If this book doesn't make you want to run then nothing will! Since reading it my running has improved and become much more enjoyable as I've been reminded why I run. Thank you Christopher McDougall!!! Keep em coming!
1416549447|5.0|YES, I know it sounds to good to be true but I used to suffer from:    1) Shin Splints  2) Knee Injury  3) ITBand issues  4) Hip Pain  5) Used every combination of Stability Shoe, Insoles, Knee Braces, ITB Band braces, Massage, and Chiropractic to help me stay running.    My first half marathon (before ChiRunning) was OK- I finished in 2:07, and had major ITBand issues.    Then, after a dismal injury before my second half marathon (Finsihed in 2:38), i decided enough was enough.  I MUST be doing something wrong!    So, I Read the ChiRunning book, and my running life completely changed.    I started from scratch, and followed the book to a \\"T\\".  IMMEDIATELY saw improvement through reduced pain and impact in my body.    I started ChiRunning 4 Months ago- and have had:    1) NO-Shin Splints  2) NO- Knee Injury  3) NO-ITBand issues  4) NO- Hip Pain  5) Got RID of every combination of Stability Shoe, Insoles, Knee Braces, ITB Band braces, etc...  6) I have also run Barefoot, and in very minimal shoes (Vibram 5 Fingers), and also Racing Flats for my Half Marathons (Saucony Kilkenny XC2)- basically, shoes you cannot run in UNLESS YOU HAVE PROPER TECHNIQUE.  And, through ChiRunning- I can!  7) Beat my previous Half Marathon PR by 20 MINUTES. (from 2:07 to 1:47!)    Proper running technique is KEY.  4 months after I started, I re-read the book to see if the information is still solid and applicable, and it IS.  Very thorough, and so far, the best book about technique and MINDSET (<---I am emphasizing this for a reason) that I have read.    100%, two thumbs up, highly recommended!
0307588335|4.0|Patrick Robinson writes [[ASIN:0060746920 techno-thrillers]] (sample: \\"Pete Mackay grabbed a small state-of-the-art stethoscope from his belt and stuck one end into each ear, the long tube onto the briefcase. `Jesus Christ!' he breathed. `Danny there's a slight ticking sound. Get the detector.'\\") and co-author Lawrence McDonald was a junior trader at Lehman Brothers for four years. Neither one seems to know any finance, nor have had access to the high levels of Lehman. Nevertheless there is a lot of useful information about the Lehman collapse. Larry's innocence means his observations are not overinterpreted, and Patrick's writing makes them flow easily (sample: \\"Lehman, like any major force decimated of its best commanders, was in a thirty-first floor turmoil, with lesser men grabbing at the helm.\\" The same thing happens in Patrick's earlier [[ASIN:1593155174 To the Death]], \\"Admiral George Morris had been away since the previous weekend visiting his son in New York. He would not be back until tomorrow morning. This left Jimmy at the helm.\\" Or compare this book's \\"When the last person arrived and the clock clicked over to 7:00 AM precisely, the door was closed. It was as close to a special forces military briefing as anything I'd ever attended.\\" to the following from Patrick's [[ASIN:0060746904 Hunter Killer]], \\"The heavy wooden doors were closed behind them and. . .General Jobert began the briefing.\\")<br /><br />The first part of the book is Larry's autobiography, which reveals mostly a gigantic sense of entitlement. When his family moves to a poorer neighborhood he is shocked at the conditions, but rather than sympathy for the people forced to live there he is repelled by them, and complains about the injustice of being treated like a poor person. He blames the brief stint in the bad neighborhood for his weak high school grades which keep him out of a top college which blocks his easy path to Wall Street success.<br /><br />Since he feels entitled to that success, he has no qualms about how to get it. Rather than learn any finance so he might be able to make a positive contribution, he decides to learn how to sell. By his own account, he's good at it. He sells people frozen pork they don't need, then moves on to a bucket shop that sells worthless stocks. After passing his Series 7 he gets a cold-calling sales job at Merrill Lynch. He describes that as the same as the bucket shop, which may not be inappropriate as the firm was at this time selling the derivatives that bankrupted Orange County among other things. He lies, trespasses and steals without apology, after all, he's entitled. He develops high-pressure sales techniques to prevent \\"clients\\" from thinking carefully about investments or talking it over with others (\\"When the potential client said he needed to run it by his wife, I answered, `Sir, these equities do not come in different colors. Your wife probably hasn't picked a winner since she picked you.'\\"). It won't shock anyone that a stock salesman cares only about his commissions and uses any trick to make a sale regardless of the investment's suitability for the customer, but it takes a deeply oblivious person boast about it right before blaming the collapse of Lehman on declining ethics. It's that obliviousness that keeps the book honest.<br /><br />Even at the end, Larry thinks he was entitled to collect on his Lehman stock options, and blames the government for not protecting them (no word about Lehman's creditors, customers or shareholders; or the people who suffered in the knock-on market collapse). True to form, he cheerfully admits in the same sentence that he opposes all other government aid to anyone. I was reminded of Jordan Belfort, who wrote [[ASIN:B002KE46WW The Wolf of Wall Street]]: the same sales ability, the same drive, the same early career and feelings. But Belfort invented the bucket shop, became one of the most powerful people in finance, lived extremely large and went to jail; and blames noone but himself and asks for no bailout. I don't believe much of his autobiography, but I think I like him better than Larry.<br /><br />The authors manage to be casually offensive every few pages. Philadelphia is like \\"Soweto\\" compared to Beacon Hill in Boston, presumably not in the sense of courageously resisting oppression and sparking the movement that ended Apartheid, but in having lots of black faces. Larry is afraid that if he doesn't lie, rich people will categorize him with the \\"Vietnamese boat people,\\" which the reader has to interpret as meaning people who deserve, or at least have to expect, mistreatment. I sincerely hope the frequent references to how beautiful Larry's mother are Patrick's contribution and not Larry's Oedipus complex.<br /><br />Larry is even more clueless about financial markets. Despite specializing in bonds, he confuses bond underwriting with securitizing bank loans. Without irony, he describes bonds as \\"rock solid\\" that will pay off \\"unless you make a lunatic selection of a doomed corporation.\\" This in a book about massive credit defaults of even AAA securities. Apparently Larry has still not made the connection between Lehman Brothers failing and its bonds not paying off. As you can imagine, a bond salesman who doesn't know what a bond is will be even less helpful when trying to explain complex securities or strategies.<br /><br />The advantage of the author not understanding the details is that he keeps focused on the larger picture. It wasn't some slight miscalculation of a hedge that brought Lehman down, it was a failure of people. Larry does have a laser-like insight into people (other than himself) which is presumably the source of his sales ability. He's not smart enough to tailor the story to his advantage, we get it straight. For example, when recounting David Einhorn's criticisms of Lehman's financial condition and disclosure, he misses the financial details but zeros in on the emotional impact it had on investors and employees.<br /><br />When you finish this book, you will know what it was like to work in Lehman without much access to power during its final 18 months. You'll know the inside gossip, sometimes wrong, sometimes more accurate than the documented history, but always capturing the mood. And while Lehman was destroyed directly by extreme high leverage on losing bets, mood was even a more important force. Realistic and energetic action from management and employees probably would not have saved the firm from dissolution, but it certainly could have preserved the equity value of Lehman's businesses, minimized job and employee savings losses and avoided the legal nightmares for Lehman's customers and creditors.<br /><br />I gave the book four stars as important to read for anyone who's interested in this stuff, not as my rating of the Larry or his opinions.for no bailout.

B0024FAG62|4.0|I would love to give all of these sets the 5 star Blu review, but when enough little things creep in there I try to remain objective and rate it comparatively against other excellent releases. The movie played great and the overall product makes for an appealing gift idea, but the initial release price kills it.<br /><br />The picture quality has the upgraded feel over the prior releases (excluding the Superbit) and provides for a fun watch with little to no grain or flicker. There is a buffered/fuzzy look in some sequences where there is a great deal of light contrasting dark clothing (several of the shots where cast members are outlined by a bright sky). To get an idea of the before/after watch the documentary making of opening sequence/Silverado title vs. the BD opening, you will see the amount of clarity upgrades. What disappointed me was the conversion backwards on the sound, meaning they chose not to take the DTS soundtrack from the [[ASIN:B0007MAO0M Silverado (2 Disc Superbit Gift Set)]] release. I love the DTS, and as usual with the THD there is a flatter feel. Not a deal breaker, just not the best.<br /><br />The supplements are a copy from the Superbit release including the Historian's Commentary, the Making Of, and the Return with Costner (which gets old fast - playing the interview in the store had customers disliking his \\"I am Silverado\\" attitude). The BD does have the new MovieIQ option (your player needs to be BD Live enabled) that when turned on is like having an updated IMDB on your screen for everything there is about the cast, crew, etc. The book is inconsequential and really only had one page (will include a scan once it streets - no prebook pics are allowed) of the 34 that entertained me. The majority of the pages are fuzzy glossy pics of the main cast and their bios. The audio has Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 tracks with subs in the same. A/B/C coded and states the \\"approx. 132 minutes\\" as opposed to the 133 on the Superbit.<br /><br />Wish I could say run out and buy it right away, but I feel the prior special edition owners will be rightfully wary. I love playing it in the store as the clarity makes for a good presentation, but I have several people waiting for a price drop. Enjoy...sh I could say run out and buy it right away, but I feel the prior special edition owners will be rightfully wary.

B001HDO4Z6|4.0|The songs here come in the same vein as Viva La Vida.  The only one I didn't care for was \\"Lost+\\". Jay-Z's vocals in the middle just didn't seem to jell with the song.  However, now when I listen to the original version, it sounds like it needs something else in there.
B00005NWM3|5.0|As an old or new Nickelback fan, you should love this album. This is the album that first put Nickelback on the charts with \\"How You Remind Me\\", \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Too Bad\\".  This is one of their better efforts and it is one of the few cd's where I listen to every single song, rather than skipping around to my favorites.There is literally not a bad song on this one. The song and sound quality is very good on this album, and all of the songs are just straight up rock and roll. Excellent listening.

B002DKGWSE|4.0|I recall seeing Wes Craven's original [[ASIN:B001JV5BIA The Last House on the Left (Unrated Collectors Edition)]] (a remake itself) several years ago and was surprised to hear it was being remade. While remakes are very common nowadays, this subject matter is not typical for mainstream American cinemas. So, the two questions are; is it a good remake? And is it a good film itself? Well, I'll get to that...First, a synopsis:    The film opens with Krug (Garrett Dillahunt) being taken to prison by two police officers. Soon, Krug's brother Francis (Aaron Paul) and girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome) have freed him and we get a brief glimpse of his depravity.    Next, we meet John (Tony Goldwyn), Emma (Monica Potter), and their daughter Mari (Sara Paxton). Staying at their lake house, they allow Mari to go into town and visit her friend Paige. The girls encounter Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), Krug's son, whom they accompany to his motel room to smoke pot. Soon, Krug and his gang burst in on them.    The rest is something you likely already know and it's quite unpleasant. Despite the familiarity most anyone has with the plot of this film, it's not a strict re-creation of the original.    Justin is immediately a more sympathetic character than he was in the original and the torturing of the two girls is considerably shorter and less disturbing than it was in the original.    This brings me to the rape scene, which is shockingly tame considering what a director like Eli Roth would've done with it. It's not exploitative and I applaud director Dennis Iliadis for opting to show the horrific nature of the crime rather than use it for mere shock value.    More on changes; the grainy, raw look of the original has been replaced by a brighter, glossier look which actually works for setting up the horror that's to come.    I haven't seen the original in many years, but I recall not being very impressed by the performances. That is not the case here. Dillahunt as Krug is appropriately menacing and believable and, overall, gives one of the better performances I've seen in a horror film. Goldwyn and Potter too are noteworthy, with the weakest link being Lindhome (as Sadie).    As a horror film, I certainly admire this remake for building genuine tension and suspense. It avoids cheap scare tactics, as well as campy humor (there are no bumbling policemen to be found here). Furthermore, if you're a fan of this genre, you should be impressed. While the first half relies on tension and atmosphere, the second-half is a blood-splattered revenge movie. But, there's also a good deal of characterization here as the parents are fully fleshed-out and human. These are not horror film cliches whom you feel nothing for, which makes this rise above many other horror films.    The final scene of the movie has been called \\"ludicrous\\" and, yes, it's not very logical. It does, however, show that Krug and his gang aren't the only ones capable of depravity. It's this scene that makes the film a horror/revenge movie rather than a character study/morality tale. What have we learned? What is the message? Has good triumphed over evil? Has justice been done? Is this sort of retribution justified?    The Last House on the Left could have been much more than it is, but the filmmakers took a more traditional route. While, I find this disappointing; on it's own merit, it's a well-made movie. It's not pleasant, but it's one of the better horror remakes I've seen and a pretty effective horror film itself.    GRADE: B+
B001LF347E|2.0|Well - where to begin?  I suppose that after you watch the first few episodes it begins to occur to you that all the main characters are slightly stupid.  In fighting a flying monster they try to use swords and spears instead of crossbows for example.  They never seem to learn from one episode to the next and always make the same basic mistakes regarding misjudging appearances and each other.  There is no real growth or progression in the relationships or maturity of the younger characters and the older ones are so inflexible and foolish that it strains all credulity.  Great liberties are taken with the original Arthurian myth so one finds Guinevere a serving maid, for example!  Their attitudes are completely modern and speech likewise makes it hard to place them from anywhere else than 21st century London.  Basic plot of an episode will be a stranger shows up who will pretend to be something they aren't in order to get at the royal family.  The king is oblivious, despite having this happen repeatedly, to the idea that somebody might use a disguise or lie to deceive him.  Merlin tries to warn him, not believed, ends up having to use magic to save the day.  Other than the tired plot devices there are occasional plot holes and inconsistencies and special effects are rather dull.  I'd guess the target audience is young teens.
0439023491|5.0|***MILD SPOILERS FOR BOOK ONE***<br /><br />I read the first book in one day.  Then I waited impatiently for six months for the second book to come out; had it on order through Amazon the second it was available to order.  Now, I'm sitting here scouring the internet for hints on when the third book might be coming out.  I should have waited to have all three books in my greedy little hands before I started reading, because I have no patience for this desperate craving to know what is going to happen next.  Of course, I didn't know that it would be so hard before I started reading.<br /><br />Hunger Games was disturbingly incredible.  While I was reading it, I forgot to breathe so many times I found myself getting lightheaded.  Catching Fire was, if anything, even more breath-stealing.  I cried in book one when I realized that there would be no magical last-minute solution to kids killing other kids for survivals' sake, but the part of me that acknowledges that reality outside the pages of this haunting story pushed me ahead to the end of the book.  I was drawn in to a world I could never imagine on my own, but so real that, when one of the featured characters died, I couldn't stop crying  -- and I felt like I was crying WITH Katniss.  When I reached the end of the book, which was so obviously not the end of the story, I immediately searched for book two, only to discover that it wouldn't be out for months.  The second I could, I ordered it, and the minute it arrived, I tore into it.  Now I wish, again, that I had waited; the desperation to know what comes next had dimmed a little, and I was coping, and now it's all fresh.<br /><br />While in the first book, the tension between Katniss's feelings for Gale and Peeta isn't as immediate, because Peeta is present for most of the story while Gale is back in the Seam, in this book, it is prominent, and it radiates out from the pages and wraps tight fingers around your heart.  The weight of her responsibility to her family, to her District, and eventually, to the people in all of the Districts and even in the Capital, is tangible; I felt it almost like a weight on my own shoulders.  Her feelings of helplessness, her desperation, all of it is so vivid, so relatable, which is an incredible feat of the author given how far from most readers' realities the story is.  Even though it is technically a young-adult story, and even though Katniss is technically still a kid, there is nothing immature about her struggles, the emotional weight of each of her decisions, or her feelings for both Peeta and Gale, and each member of her circle of loved ones.  I couldn't bring myself to prefer any of her options over another, including which boy to love (I love them both).<br /><br />All I can really say is that the author's ability to grab you by the heart, and by the gut, and hold on through every single page, is incredible.  My heart clenched, and raced, and stopped, and sighed, and raced and clenched some more.  I can't even count the number of times the turn of events made me burst out with \\"Oh my God!\\" while I read this book.  It's one of those rare times that an incredible story somehow gets even better in the second installment.

0590129279|5.0|This book, this particular English translation, is so beautifully written!  I can only imagine that I will learn something new each time I sit down to enjoy it.
0440237688|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books. I read it as an adolescent, and later in high school as required reading.     As an adult, I once overheard some mothers talking about The Giver. I said \\"Oh, I love that book!\\" and immediately realized they did not. In their view, it was a horrible piece of trash and there was no WAY their innocent teens could ever be exposed to it. It was the first time I'd thought of someone having that reaction to what I thought was a brilliant piece of literature.    So I read some of the 1-star reviews here, expecting to see comments in line with what those mothers said. But most of the negative reviews appear to have been written by students who had to read the book for class. I can only assume writing a review on Amazon was part of the assignment, too. A note to teachers: don't make your students write amazon reviews. If you want to read a million versions of \\"This stupid book was so boring,\\" at least don't subject the rest of the world to it.    Also those forced reviews take away from legitimately critical reviews. There are people who are honestly offended by this book (and not because it's boring). While I disagree with them, I think it's a valid point for a potential reader to consider. If adult themes, including euthanasia, are not something you want to read about, you may not enjoy this book.     As for me, I stand by what I said to that group of mothers.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|My grand daughter was turning 4 and is in love with princess everything! So I purchased a 'used' DVD of Beauty and the Beast Special Edition from twobrothersdvds.com.  It arrived in ample time for her birthday, but it was a week or so until we heard that it 'paused' in the middle of the movie, several times while my daughter and grand daughter were watching it.  I e-mailed them and they sent another DVD within a few days - no questions asked.    In this day and age, this is amazing!  I'd definitely purchase more (princess) DVDs from them, without hesitation!
B001K3JF7K|1.0|I am a big fan of Diana krall, but her last couple of albums suck.  I just listened to Quite Nights and thought I would fall asleep at the slow, mushy, breathless pace of the songs and the arrangements.  Where is the swinging paino artist with the great voice that carried her to fame?  I guess like Tiger Woods, marriage and a couple of kids will do you in every time.  I was most disappointed in the \\"tickle the ivories\\" version of her songs. Has she forgotten what made her famous - a driving piano, with complicated solos that arouse interest and a beat in the listeners.  In some tunes, she barely touches the keys and she seems to have fallen in to this pattern in her TV appearances.  She sits at the piano, turns to the audience, whispers some lyrics and turned to play a few notes that do nothing to contribute to the tune.  If she insists on doing this, I suggest she give up the piano and do a stand up version of her songs. What is suffering here is both her singing and her piano playing.  Too bad. I immediately trashed the CD I bought. Listening to it once is once too often.

B000063DFN|5.0|Today we celebrate the quarter of century this masterpiece came out.<br /><br />This album marks a very high point of evolution of the Iron Maiden sounds from their beggining. More complex sound, fast, strong, sharp and as always in Maiden music, so rhythm.<br /><br />The music of Powerslave is outstanding, incredible, its pure adrenaline, oh God I need to breath strong with this magical themes.<br /><br />Powerslave become to represent a very conceptual record with egiptian and epic songs like Powerslave, Flash of the blade, The Duellist.<br /><br />Beside we found more contemporary thems like the very famous Aces High and Two minutes to midnight.<br /><br />The last superb The Rime of the Anciente Mariner is ... well I don't have words, hear it, feel it... is the Iron Maiden Opera ... so beatiful lyrics develops Steve Harris arround the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem. What kind of inspiration would exist in this guy mind!!! My favorite Iron Maiden song with Powerlave and Infite Dreams.<br /><br />The songs:<br /><br /> 1. Aces High ... 11/10 Adrenaline become musical notes!.... Excelent epic music with the lyrics about the RAF defending United Kingdom against Luftwaffe and the Third Riech.<br /> 2. 2 Minutes to Midnight ... 8/10 Contemporay theme about total aniquilation of the war culture of death in the 80s era of cool war.<br /> 3. Losfer words (Big 'Orra) ... 8/10 Very good instrumental music with melodic games between the bass, guitars and drums.<br /> 4. Flash of the blade ... 8/10 Excelent epic song about the fight with swords or fencing. (another Bruce hobbie!) I stand out in the song the perfomance of Dickinson with beutiful changes of tones in his chorus.<br /> 5. The Duellists ... 10/10 Another very beatiful perfomance of Dickinson in very good musical perfomance too. The musical notes flights fast and strong. You can appreciate classic rhythm guitars of Dave and Adrian stamping the sign or Iron Maiden sounds.<br /> 6. Back in the Village ... 7.5/8 A particular song a little different in my opinion of the rest of the songs. Very good, fast song too.<br /> 7. Powerslave ... 15/10 The most great song ever composed by Bruce Dickinson. ufff The main song theme of the album. Absolutely transports you three thousand years ago. The lyrics in first person make narration of an Egiptian King which deny to let this world and deny to let the power. You can see it as a epic narration and a metaphor. The musical quality of this composition seems to be out of this world!!!<br /> 8. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ...15/10 For me these song marks the highest point of the Maiden inspiration, these masterpiece remember you the intelectual level of Iron Maiden leader. Mr Steve Harris. 13 Minutes of music with your mind totally involved in the epic drama of the Mariner and his shipmates. Steve does a magistral \\"growth\\" of the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem. The music is too an in extreme and incredible Opera with a different melodies on it. These song I think is a unique specie.<br /><br />What more I can say... 25 years hearing Powerslave and each day I feel these album growing in the music history.<br /><br />Thanks Iron Maiden, incredible for this young boys in the 80s the quality and creative of the music that deliver us.<br /><br />Release date September 3th, 1984 - September 3th, 2009. Recorded at Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Outstanding and delightful read.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning of the trials, tribulations and escapades of the characters.  A must read!
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|The album is actually rather good, But C'mon Madonna! You can do so much better than this.     \\"Hard Candy\\" is overall a Dance/Electronic album with hip-hop sensibilities.   I love all the songs minus the weirdo \\"Spanish Lesson\\" which i can only listen too a couple times before i'ts on skip mode all over again.    I'm hoping and praying for another \\"Confessions on the Dancefloor\\" or \\"Ray of Light\\" but for right now, this album is actually pretty catchy material.    My Favorite Songs are  Devil Wouldn't Recognize You- I LOVE THE LYRICS and the Tempo of the ballad, i just wish Justin Timberlake's influance wasn't so obvious.   Give It 2 Me- classic Madonna dance track- i love it.    Great album, but we know she can achieve Monumental material , \\"Hard Candy\\" is just too generic. It's the type of stuff we expect from the Pop Princess, not the Queen of Pop. so i give it 4 stars.
0446402397|4.0|This was definitely one of the best books that I've read all year for the first 90%, but unfortunately, the weak ending really takes away from the impact of the book.

B002JCSWHA|4.0|This is a story everyone in Japan knows. Based on the true story of a dog called \\"Chuken-Hachiko (meaning \\"A loyal dog Hachiko\\") that lived in Shibuya, Tokyo, \\"Hachiko: A Dog's Tale\\" is a moving tale about friendship and loyalty between a man and a dog.     In \\"Hachiko: A Dog's Tale\\" Richard Gere plays Parker Wilson, a college professor teaching music. One evening Parker finds a lost puppy at the station of fictional east coast town Bedridge, where he lives with his wife Cate (Joan Allen) and daughter Andy (Sarah Roemer). (The film was actually shot in Rhode Island.) No one at the station knows why the puppy is there, so the professor takes the dog home and keeps him. The puppy's name is Hachi, which means \\"eight\\" in Japanese.    Hachi grows up and it becomes his custom to wait for the professor at the station every day at 5 pm. Hachi becomes a fixture of the station and a favorite of the commuters. When they think their happy times last forever, however, something happens, and Hachi has to wait Parker much longer than he used to do.    Richard Gere (who also co-produced the film) turns in a solid performance as usual, as a family man who reluctantly takes care of a lost puppy, but the real star of the film is, not surprising, Hachi himself as the faithful dog. Among the supports, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Parker's friend, Jason Alexander as the station master and Erick Avari as a hot dog vendor are memorable, but unfortunately female supports including Joan Allen, Sarah Roemer and Davenia McFadden are a bit wasted in this comparatively short film.    \\"Hachiko: A Dog's Tale\\" is an American remake of \\"Hachiko monogatari\\" (1987) directed by Seijirô Kôyama. The Japanese film's story is inspired by the true story of an Akita dog Hachiko (1923-35) and the professor of Tokyo Imperial University (today's The University of Tokyo) Hidesabur Ueno (1871-1925). Those who have visited Tokyo may remember the bronze stature of the dog at JR Shibuya station where Hachi was once seen.    Helmed by the director Lasse Hallström (\\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" \\"My Life as a Dog\\"), the film is a good example of a simple story well told. It is not a big story, but its emotional power is undeniable.
B002436WFI|3.0|Since I love the books of Terry Pratchett and really enjoyed the Hogsfather movie, I had great expectations for this movie duo. But it was a disappointment to me and my wife fell asleep before the end.     The good points   - most special effects are well done, especially the turtle scenes. The exception was an old fashioned shot of Rincewind riding towards the camera on horseback with the background obviously added in later.   - The luggage was believable.  - The first archwizard gave the best performance of the cast. Cohen was OK.     The weak points  - I'm very disappointed in Sean Astin's performance. Was he acting at all or just saying the lines? He gave real depth to Sam the Hobbit but Twoflower was just flat  - Rincewind. Better but still not much character there.   - The evil wizard. Also felt strained. Trying too hard to be evil?  - Death - hated the echo effect. (Not the actor's fault) What was he saying? I wish the subtitles worked for the DVD.   - Much of the original humor was removed. Even with 3 hours of film things had to be cut but I really liked the book scenes with the trees talking to Rincewind and he refused to listen. Or the rocks talking to him. Or death & the four horseman playing bridge. Or sunlight slowed by magic. This gave depth to Rimworld and made it seem more real and magical.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Ok first off let me say I am a huge fan so some say my review might be a little biased but this album is FIRE!! Every track gives you something, whether you want to dance, be inspired or wipe that man off your shoulder. Forget all the whoopla about the past because Mrs. Houston is back and regardless of what none of the artist today will ever match her vocal ability (Today, Tomorrow or Yesteryear!!) So don't get it twisted!! This album is more than just 3 great tracks, its an album of great music. You can't compare this to an old Whitney album because it is a new day with new things to talk about, with new experiences. So get past the drama, the media and open your ears and heart to the new work of Mrs. Whitney Houston!! You will be pleasantly moved!!

It struck a strong chord inside (pun intended)as I delved farther into his world.It takes awhile to love all his music, but even the tunes I forgave him for writing are my favorites today.   Opel is a great tune in itself, and the differant takes of other material I already own are always illuminating in SOME way!BARRETTMANIA 4 EVER!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The show is a hit - addicting is a better word.    Once you view it, you can't wait for the next episode.    However, one would be better going to a local discount dept store to obtain it. Shipping (I paid for standard shipping, hoping to get it earlier) is a disaster. The product shipped from Lexington KY. I live 35 miles away and it took 4 (FOUR) days for the item to arrive - another online discount outlet ships out new releases early so that you received the product ON the manufacturer's release date.     Bottom line - great show, lousy mail service from Amazon.
B00297FEUI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the score from the movie and highly recommend it to other transformer fans. My only qualm is I wish that the music tracks were longer.

0312370849|4.0|Echoing two wonderful novels, [[ASIN:B000FA5MV2 Sophie's Choice]] by William Styron and [[ASIN:1400096278 Suite Francaise]] by Irene Nemirovsky, Tatiana de Rosnay tells an affecting story of Jews in Paris during the Nazi occupation.  As Jews are herded into concentration camps by the Paris police (under orders from the German occupation) young Sarah, an 11-year old girl living with her family, holds the key to a horrible secret about her younger brother.  In contemporary Paris, a US-born journalist discovers Sarah's story while learning about the family-owned house that she and her French husband are about to occupy.<br /><br />The format is a little choppy at first, as de Rosnay moves back and forth between 1942 and the 2000s.  The Holocaust story is harrowing.  By necessity, the modern story pales in comparison, reinforcing how the French try to push their ugly complicity with Nazi occupation crimes out of their minds.  The narrative line smooths out in the second half of the book as the journalist's search carries to its conclusion.  A slightly saccharine ending keeps \\"Sarah's Key\\" from being a pure five-star read.  Still, \\"Sarah's Key\\" earns four solid stars and a strong recommendation to all readers, including young people with an interest in 20th century history.
0142407542|4.0|A good sequel to \\"The Gruffalo\\" and even more enjoyable if you have read that first one.  My boys (7 & 5) find the mouse smart and amusing, especially the 5 year old.  I would recommend.

B0019IB0II|5.0|I saw Ms. Taylor's speech via Ted Talks, and was impressed with her candor and inquisitive mind, so I decided to dive into reading her book. I was completely impressed - not as much with the scientific discussion of the stroke and the way she handled it, but by her positive, spiritual connection to the events, and how she was able to rally from them to live a full life. Ms. Taylor is an inspiration and a cautious warning - life is incredibly fragile and could be over in a moment's notice. Her descriptions of the love from her mother are especially touching; she was her mother's baby again, but in an adult body.    Most revealing to me is the description of how others interacted with her. Here's an Ivy-League trained neuroscientist who has people treating her like a simpleton. She, along with many other suffers of stroke and brain damage, are not simple, they're just unable to communicate in the ways that we are used to. It can be challenging, but after reading this, I've tried to put myself in the shoes of those I work with, and understand things from their point of view.

0307346617|4.0|What a book!  Zombies have been done to (ahem) death, yet Max Brooks produces an innovative, enthralling read that reinvigorates the genre yet again.  The style is the key to the book's concept, and using interview transcripts to tell the story of the Apocolypse is a great, classy touch.  Deserves to be on every horror fan's book shelf.

Any work by Thomas Pynchon requires considerable effort on the part of the reader and this one is no exception, but the entertainment factor is high.  Pynchon's broad range of knowledge about the most esoteric of subjects always amazes--it's as if he knows everything I know and a hundred times more.  Gravity's Rainbow is still my favorite work.
0439023491|5.0|Gold Star Award Winner!<br /><br />When I picked up THE HUNGER GAMES, it immediately became \\"The Book\\" that I recommended to everyone who would listen. I stayed up until the wee hours every night to see what happened next. I blogged about it. I named a stray kitten \\"Rue.\\" Not surprisingly, when I got my greedy hands on a copy of its sequel, CATCHING FIRE, I practically tore off the cover in my eagerness to dive in. Happily, the second installment of this compelling series did not disappoint. Now the only problem is waiting for the third book in this exciting trilogy.<br /><br />CATCHING FIRE picks up six months after Kat and Peeta won the Hunger Games. Despite being a national hero and having the ability to provide a nice house and plenty of food for her family, Kat is still worried. She managed to win the Hunger Games, despite the Panem government's plans. Her behavior is viewed by the evil President Snow as defiance, which is never tolerated. She is a well-known, popular figure, so the president will not kill her outright, but Kat lives in fear that at any moment, she and those she loves could be punished for her actions.<br /><br />Soon Kat learns that her performance in the Hunger Games arena had far-reaching consequences. In beating the government at its own game the previous year, Kat unintentionally demonstrated that the all-powerful President Snow is not quite so all-powerful. Now President Snow expects Kat to prove that she is a loyal citizen who doesn't support the anti-government rumblings that are spreading throughout the country. Her support is vital since it was her act of defiance that ignited the rumblings to begin with. And if she doesn't succeed to President Snow's satisfaction, her family and friends will pay the price.<br /><br />CATCHING FIRE is a gripping follow-up to THE HUNGER GAMES. All the same characters are back - with the exception of those who were killed in Book #1, of course. Even more than in THE HUNGER GAMES, Kat is largely clueless about the strategies and plots that are going on around her. At times, this can be trying for the reader because by now she should know that everyone has an agenda, and if you're not directing the game, then you're a pawn. Still, her strength is an extraordinary instinct for survival. It's ironic that the Capitol government which created the Hunger Games and tries so hard to keep its people feeling helpless is also responsible for creating a person like Kat. She gained her skills and toughness by surviving unspeakably brutal conditions.<br /><br />One key difference between the two books is that in THE HUNGER GAMES, reality TV was painted as a villain. A voyeuristic public's desire to be entertained by the suffering of others forced Hunger Games competitors to behave in inhuman ways. The oppressive government that created the competition was largely an ever-present background threat. In CATCHING FIRE, however, the government's cruelty is front and center as its boot heel presses ever harder on the throats of its people. The role of television and at-home audiences shifts in this book, and they become more of a weapon against the government than against the people.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed CATCHING FIRE, there were times, particularly in the first half, that it made me uncomfortable. There are so many parallels between the excesses of Panem's government and those of governments around our modern world. Governments that spy on their own people, starvation caused not by a shortage of food but from corrupt government policies, the impossibly wide divide between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots,\\" and the helplessness suffered by citizens who believe there's nothing they can do about any of it. As I read, I kept asking myself, \\"How much will these people tolerate before they put a stop to it?\\" But then I winced time and again as I was forced to ask, \\"How much will I?\\"<br /><br />CATCHING FIRE feels more serious and less like escapist fiction than THE HUNGER GAMES. It executes its message equally well, though, and the fact that I saw some of its twists coming didn't lessen their impact. Author Suzanne Collins has prepared another treacherous arena for her readers - and, as in THE HUNGER GAMES, only some of the hazards are in the fictional world of Panem.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  K.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I have 4 of these controllers and have had no problems with them yet.  It's perfect for playing Little Big Planet.  It should be the standard controller that comes with the console now.  There is only one problem with this package...where is the power cord?  It's seems to me after paying this much for the controller they would at least put a power cord it in the package.
0385341008|5.0|What can I say!  It was delightful and I would recommend it to anyone.<br />The \\"letter style\\" kept me guessing about a few things, but that was okay.  I still can not figure out why we didn't ever have a letter from Sophie.<br />I also felt like I learned a lot about that time era that I had missed in school.<br />My only complaint is that it ended too quickly.  I needed a few more pages and detail about how the wedding and life afterwards fell into place.
B000063DIR|1.0|The \\"remastering\\" - read butchering imposed to this metal classic by the Osbournes and/or their record company is unbelievable. Kudos for making it like s*** too. Get the original album. This is not Ozzy and will definitely remain a stain on his legacy.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I'm happy to see Houston back in the recording studio! At least she appears to be making an effort to get back on track. The album is disappointing, but then, it could not have been otherwise. Whitney suffers in comparison to another singer--Whitney Houston! She took such a long hiatus from recording, that folks' last memory of her was of that magnificent voice. They could not help but be disappointed. Sinatra suffered a similar degradation of his chops from boozing and cigarette smoking. But he remained in the limelight, singing so the changes appeared more gradual, less abrupt. Many grew to love Sinatra's lower, emotionally laden timbre. It fit the songs he became most famous for. Sinatra surrounded himself with topnotch arrangers and that's what Houston needs to do,too. Arrangers who can fit the song to the voice without the singer embarrassing herself. They don't need to be over produced or tricked out with gimmicks like fast dance tempos and overlays. Houston still has a great voice, but the appropriate showcase for it has changed. She would benefit from quitting smoking if she hasn't already, working with a vocal coach and an otolaryngologist. Steal Diana Krall's arranger and take it slow. It will never be the voice of 20 years ago, but with any luck, it can still be a wonderful, but different voice for the next 20 years.
B001UXJQHE|5.0|Andre Rieu entertains huge crowds who adore him and his orchestra, and the lovely music they produce.  His concerts contain a mix of classics, popular and patriotic selections -- Strauss to the Beatles.  Something for everyone,performed with skill and humor.  The concert in Australia is no exception!
B001AQTWF2|1.0|Over-produced and utterly forgettable, the new Whitney Houston can't get the strength back of her brighter days. Voice markedly changed by time and whatever, the golden girl of pop who once wanted to dance with somebody is finished. Beat machine tempos and every trite device used to shore up weak vocals gets a workout here. Even he signature tune I TURN TO YOU is FM junk. Whitney Houston's attempt to resurrect had old listeners hoping for a miracle and it didn't happen. Barely recognizable as Whitney Houston, the gargling and stretched tones are poor beyond anything but a quick toss into the bargain bin.<br /><br />For a past fan, this is really sad to admit, but she ain't Whitney anymore, it's electronically-manipulated near-beer.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|After reading all the two and one star reviews, I was apprehensive about this movie, but, I decided to give it a go, and boy am I glad I did. Like the review title says, I loved it. Of course, Amanda acted like a modern girl. She was, after all. And I didn't even mind the ending. I'll be looking at more like this.
B00288KNL8|2.0|I have to say, we watched this with our children, 5 and 7 and I was disappointed with the lack of family friendliness of this movie.  I thought it was too scary for a PG movie and didn't like the heavy chested, lack of clothing part of the movie with little kids.  Thought that was a bit much.  We have seen so many other animated movies like this, but I was disappointed and a bit shocked by some of the content of this movie, from a parents perspective.  I would have not let my kids see it if I would have watched it in advance!  Perhaps older children would be fine but mine were definitely freaked out by it and afraid to go to bed.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|Took mine back tonight!  It worked for little crumbs and that's about it.  My kids drag grass clippings in the house and it just flung them, actually it just flung pretty much everything.  Found myself wanting to throw the thing after a while. Tried giving it a few days but in general I just think it a cheap product. It IS very  light but does not get the job done.

0452295548|5.0|This is a must read for everyone over age 50 or who has parents over age 50.  Well written by an author who really knows what it's all about.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This product does what it says it will. It is affordable and will surprise you with its sound quality. It is a little hokey to hook up and it would be nice if it was wireless- but for the price I cant complain. I seriously recommend this headset to anyone who wants to game in peace at 3:00 in the morning like me.
B0000041WV|5.0|For my money Dvorak's symphonic cycle is one of the glories of all orchestral music! and this set is a prime example of this.In brief the 1st- 4th are the best Ive heard;the 5th is superb;the 6th very good;8th & 9th are  on my short list of preferred recordings The .only reservation I have is the 7th which to my ears received sound not up to the overall quality of the rest of this set.For the 7th try Dohnanyi & Cleveland on Decca;also  try Chung's fine 6th & 8th DG & Fischers 8th & 9th Philips.That said whether you are new to to this music or not & don't have this set you are missing out on beautiful music given both profound and  rousing performances by all involved.Add all this to the cost of this set -grab it! P.S. the overtures are equally fine.
B0019GO5DC|1.0|I guess I really couldn't give an accurate review of the product since I never received it. I've seen the movie before and I really liked it, so I was hoping to see it again.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I like all the songs (except maybe Ipanema) that she does but her style on this particular CD is wanting. She uses this soft, breathy voice which I don't care for. It doesn't compare to other of her albums such as Live in Paris. I'm selling my copy, or trying to.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|When I first heard samples of the songs, like a lot of others I recognized her voice was considerably deeper but I immediately knew I liked Million Dollar Bill, Worth It and Salute. I let the cd play softly while I was falling asleep, and I tell you--I absolutely fell in love with the whole cd!!!     Yes her voice is deeper, but she doesn't let you forget who it is. It is still Whitney, with the voice from Heaven mostly singing in a deeper voice. Yet, In some of the songs her voice is a little lighter than in others.  She does a great job of blending the mellow voice while sometimes throwing in the soft pretty voice.    This cd is already my favorite of the year.    Now when I play my Whitney Houston collections, I can hear her sing in a variety of styles.     Did I say I love it?
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This DVD arrived very quickly and was in excellent condition.  It was advertised as previously owned.  But the only way you could tell is that there was no cellaphane around the DVD.  We have really enjoyed our purchase.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Fantastic, accurate, moving. it makes you evaluate your life and appreciate all the things you have achieved in life. I've been a huge fan of Will Smith and I think this is his best work by far. Mr. Smith have earned an Oscar - definitely deserved and I still think the movie should have gotten this nomination as well (The Departed won in that year). Every time I watch this movie, I think of my struggle by being the first generation immigrant from Russia and my son, who is 3.5. We are blessed and after watching the movie - it makes us much more closer. Thank you to the creators of this movie. You have changed my life.
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan's masterpiece should be required reading for anyone who eats food.     This is especially for those that eat a lot of processed foods, ones not found on the edge of grocery stores. Most grocery stores place 'real food'. like cheese, milk, eggs, fresh meat, vegetables, and bread on the perimeter of the store. Michael shows why you should shop the perimeter of the store, and avoid the isles, where overly processed, fat and sugar laden food-like items exist.    His description of Polyface farm in Virginia is especially well done. After reading this section, I wanted to get on a plane and fly to Staunton.    If you don't change you way of looking at food after reading this book, you didn't get it-read it again.    A marvelous book.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've never read the book, never seen the BBC version, never even knew what the movie was about.  It was one of those books they order you to read in high school, but just like Moby Dick and Huckleberry Finn, I skipped that assignment.    I saw previews for this movie on TV and had no interest in watching it.  I'm really not into movies set in old times and I'm not a Keira Knightley fan either.  However, one day I happened to flip through the channels and before I knew what the movie was, I was hooked.  Really, one scene is all it took.    I watched the remainder of the movie and set my DVR to record the whole thing next time it was on.    The story is great.  The acting is great.  The scenery is great.  I've never really liked Knightley, but after seeing this movie, I certainly have respect for her.  She was great in this movie.  I can't think of a single character in the movie that wasn't played well by the actor/actress.  You knew what they were feeling even when they didn't speak.  Matthew McFayden was also amazing in this movie. I had never even heard of him, but he didn't make one false move in this film!    Although there were a few things that didn't seem 'quite right', this is still an excellent movie.  It never gets boring, and although you know what's going to happen in the end, it doesn't matter because the story up to the end is just so good, and the ending is awesomely played.      I really thought I wouldn't like this movie, and now it's probably my second favorite of all time.  My first is \\"Office Space\\".  I know...totally different genres.  Like I said, I didn't think I'd like this movie.
0810979772|5.0|I purchased this book for my son; it arrived promptly and he was thrilled.  He's been carrying it around ever since.  Oh, with a pencil, too, so that he can \\"Do It Himself\\"<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book, I've already got it on pre-order!
B002GHHJU4|3.0|Let me start off by saying that that despite my weird obsession for Dashboard Confessional, I have pretty much grown out of the whiny \\"emo\\" style of music.  Not saying that is what the soundtrack actually sounds like, since it's not, but a quick glance at the artists and that is what you expect.  A whiny, angst-ridden soundtrack for a movie that really looks bad according to the trailers.    Well, the movie still looks pretty bad since the only thing it has going for it is Megan Fox who is wearing out her welcome with me quite quickly, the soundtrack on the other hand is pretty interesting to say the least.    I originally picked it up to listen to the Dashboard track.  While not an amazing song it does work to satisfy my DC crave.  The rest of the album is actually not bad.  While some of the songs have been previously released, I hadn't heard many of them so I guess I am the target market in that sense.    Lets start off with the good.  The Panic at the Disco song is pretty good.  A departure from the first album that I am familiar with, it is pretty catchy.  Hayley Williams, the lead singer for Paramore, contributes a track, \\"Teenagers\\", and it is pretty good.  The annoyance is kept down and her high pitches that I hate Paramore for at times are kept to a minimum.  I don't skip the track so that is definately a compliment.    A band I never heard of, Low Shoulder has a track that is catchy, \\"Through The Trees\\".  I really like it.  Same with \\"Time\\" from Cute is What We Aim For.  I don't normally like them since again that whiny stuff has pretty much passed me by, but it is a good song.  The cover of \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" is an interesting take and has grown on me.  \\"Little Lover's So Polite\\" from the Silversun Pickups, which I currently own on their first album, is a good contribution.  Finally, the Cobra Starship track is ok.  It isn't offensive or unpleasurable, just average.    Now the bad is the rest of the album.  The rest of the tracks are just whiny and annoying.  I skipped through them subsequent playthroughs.  \\"New In Town\\" and and \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" are especially bad.    Overall the soundtrack isn't bad.  A solid 8 tracks is more than I can say for most albums or soundtracks so it isn't too difficult to recommend.  Add in an extra star if you are in high school since honestly, you are probably the target market and will know a few of the artists that I didn't mention above.  I hadn't heard of a few of the folks on here and a little google was in order for the research.    Again, not a terrible soundtrack.  Average to me, but it was an interesting surprise based on the \\"known\\" artists on the track list.  It isn't all whiny \\"emo\\" music which I appreciate.
037582913X|5.0|I remember LOVING this book as a child.  Now MY kids love it.  It is so much fun reading it to them and just remembering back to when I read it as a child.  My kids laugh so hard at Grover begging them not to turn the page; him tying the pages together, building a brick wall, etc.  They LOVE it.  We make a game and use all our strength to turn the pages when Grover makes it hard.<br />This is truly a timeless book.  If you do not already own it, please buy it.  Your preschool age child will adore it.

0312370849|1.0|I don't believe this book. Nor tears of people who read this book either. While its' important to know the historical facts, this book is all about author's and/or her creation Julia's pride, sentiments, and self-satisfaction rather than Jewish family itself. Among them, I felt her pride most. Beautiful tears hide true nature of this work. I wish there was more weight on Jewish people on this book, but I don't believe this author was capable of doing it. It's too much about \\"me\\" Julia. And the author couldn't resist showing it.    And maybe, I realized afterwards, that was why, I had problem seeing the things through Sarah's eyes where it's intended to be read that way. I beleive all the details of terrible events described here are based on, or something very close to what acctually happened, but I felt Sarah was somewhere far, and not real at all. I first thought the writer was not skilled enough, and it still might be a part of it, but now I believe it is mainly because the writer wanted show herself more, saying, \\"I am a good person, and I did a great job\\", wearing a mask of an american. And that is why Julia is much more realistic than Sarah, I think.    Moreover, at one point I felt like I wanted to see more of Sarah so badly, she suddenly disappears from pages. I guess it's because Sarah is only important for Julia to make her feel good about herself, no more no less. She seems care less about Jewish people than she tries to look. The novel tells itself.    This is important work, but I don't like this kind of presentation.    I live in Boston, no american, no french, nor have relationship with Jewish famly, but I felt a little anger inside me after reading this. Why this book have to be so much about the Journalist?  I let Julia cry and I don't care a bit. I am not going to be moved by tears of american or french, whatever. They can cry all the way through the ends, and I don't care a bit. I care more about Jewish people who acctually suffered, or so I wishto be that way myself, and if I ever write a book about it, I would never say \\"I care so much about these people!\\" out loud just like this author did.    You need modesty.  Showing tears simply don't do the job.    I only know a few fiction books that describe the suffering of Jewish people in at least some parts of their storylines, and Beach Music by Pat Conroy is one of them. If I read a fiction, I prefer something like that, a more modest approach. But I have to admit I don't know much about it, too.    I like to read good documentaries or good novels, not like this one.
0812977246|5.0|I love to read almost anything pertaining to Russia. This book was fantastic! I have visited Moscow and places and activities mentioned were quite accurate.

B001FB4W0M|3.0|I am bummed to be writing this review. Supernatural is my favorite show on TV and this was the best season so far. I am NOT critisizing the show. The Blu Ray transfer looks awful. It is grainy and inconsistent. I watched the last episode of season 4 on TV tonight and compared it to the Blu Ray and besides the HUGE CW logo on the screen the TV picture looked much clearer. I have a pretty good player. It's a Panasonic BD 30. It is fully updated and in perfect working condition. I can't believe they did such a BAD JOB on such a GREAT SHOW.
0767827694|1.0|Orlando is a very good movie, visually stunning and well acted. The copy I received was plagued with dark spots, poor sound, and occasional freeze frames -- almost as if it was copied from a copyrighted original.The price was cheap (about $10.00 US); I gues you get what you paid for.
0375704027|5.0|I will not be able to do this book justice in this short review on Amazon.  I will study this book for the rest of my life and place it among the greatest novels I have read.  Norwegian Wood is simply magnificent.  Strip away the awkward young love and the experimental erotica and what's left is a deep examination of the human heart.  Haruki Murakami, although not an educated psychologist, is an extremely talented novelist.  We are all amateur observers of the human condition and have experienced the love and pain created in our own relationships, Murakami merely writes it down for us to examine more closely.<br /><br />Not all of us have experienced the darker side of emotional behavior when loss, leads to depression, which can lead to suicidal gestures, and which might ultimately lead to a terminal act.  Here is a spoiler.  There are four suicides in this book--one by carbon monoxide asphyxiation, one through wrist laceration, and two by hanging.  There are other deaths described as well.  But this is not a morbid book.  On the contrary Murakami goes to great measure to capture the beauty of life both in natural and physical state and in its more mystical shape of brotherly love and of course erotic love.  He captures the beauty of human friendship and what happens when selfishness overrules better judgment, but ultimately that selflessness can prevail, in some cases it can save.<br /><br />Murakami `s philosophy, that \\"...death exists as a part of life\\", permeates this book, but also that lives and experiences, even those that have been lost can continue to live.  \\"Norwegian Wood\\", the Beatle's song not the novel, evokes the memories of lives and loves worth remembering for the characters in this novel.  We all have similar songs that remind us of those other experiences we have long since forgotten, good and bad.  Murakami is simply reminding us that not only is it OK to remember, it is a fundamental requirement of the well lived and well considered life.
0439023491|5.0|I first want to say Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer. The second book just as good as the first book. I hate having to wait on the other books to come out. The book has great descriptions of the characters clothing, the food, and lots of action. I have come to love the characters she has created and look forward to all the other books. I would recommend this book to anyone! Can't wait for the next one.
B001W63DX2|4.0|I found the 'documentary' portion to be very good for what is there. Maybe I was under the wrong impression, but I could have sworn that the movie part was going to be a heck of a lot longer. They really just scratched the surface of what was happening. That aside, there are a lot of great little nuggets of human moments around the band in the film. It is well done. The backstage pantomimes of the crew were particularly funny during Run To The Hills and 2 Minutes. I'm not sure if it's a criticism or not, but I guess I just wanted more of it. The film of the concert clips were great 1st because it's maiden and secondly because it's been shot and edited by someone other than the band and the quick cuts and jumping around of previous concerts has been toned down quite a bit. The concert is a real celebration of Maiden. The sound and the performances are all first rate, especially Bruce who is just on fire right now. This was an amazing tour and this is a great souvenir of those shows. Now... how about a NEW album?
B002FVKMBO|5.0|This is one of the strongest releases of this genre during the past two years.  Fans of Nightwish, Within Temptation, Epica, etc. will love this!  This album stands up to any of Nightwish or Within Temptation's releases in my opinion, it is a very pleasant surprise indeed!  Deeply lush arrangements, and strong non-operatic vocals by the beautiful Charlotte Wessels will push your audio equipment to its limit.  The reviewer below cites Wessels as comparing to Karen Carpenter, however after numerous listens I don't hear the comparison, but rather  her vocal quality  is very similar to Shania Twain, but without the country/western inflection  of course.  While not as powerful vocally as Floor Jansen or Tarja Turunen, Wessels' voice is uniquely expressive.  Also Nightwish bassist/vocalist Marco Hietala can be heard on two tracks; Nothing Left and Control the Storm.  I wish Marco could have been included on more, as his vocal style somehow meshes perfectly with Wessels.  The strongest tracks are:<br />April Rain<br />Start Swimming<br />Invidia<br />Nothing Left  (with Marco Hietala)<br />Come Closer<br />I'll Reach You<br />Virtue and Vice<br />Control the Storm (with Marco Hietala)<br /><br />It's a shame this genre has not caught on in the U.S., as the musicianship and artistry is amazing, and is far better than anything coming from the U.S. at present.  Delain exemplifies the best of these qualities, download this entire album immediately!<br />Romanov Dynasty
B00005JLD4|5.0|Director, Philip Noyce, does an outstanding job of finding local talent. Brilliant performances are given by first time actors for the roles of Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), little sister Daisy Craig (Tianna Sansbury), and cousin Gracie Fields (Laura Monoghan). Peter Gabriel receives a Golden Globe nomination for \\"Best Original Score.\\"    Based on a true story, \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" is a powerful and poignant recount of three young Aboriginal girls who fall victim, in the early 1930's, to a government led initiative to purify `half-caste' children. Born out of `white man's' arrogance, the program is publicized as functioning for the betterment of the children. The supposition proposes that bi-racial (half-caste) Aborigine children are better off raised in white families. There, they will be sent to school and taught to live among white people.     A supremacist minded politician, A. O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) leads the charge in what is now known as \\"the stolen generations,\\" a phrase used to depict the result caused by barbaric acts of stripping children from their families, leaving behind their indigenous culture, and forcing new beliefs upon them.    As the story unfolds, what the government officials do not count on is the determination and resourceful spirit of these three young girls and their overwhelming desire to return to their native families. The journey continues as they put their destiny into their own hands and face the biggest survival test of their young lives. First, they must escape from the Moore River Native Settlement where they are being held captive.    When word arrives of the girls' escape, the Jigalong tribe turns to their sacred ways in hopes of evoking the spirit world to help bring them back home. Family members participate in rituals filled with ancient chants, rhythmic drumming, and meditation to call up strength, guidance, and protection for the long journey home. To get home, the girls will have to avoid being caught by skilled trackers, walk 1,500 miles over treacherous terrain, endure searing heat, thirst and hunger -- and the only thing they have to navigate by is a \\"rabbit-proof fence.\\"      Rabbit-Proof Fence.

He never disappoints; this show was magnificent; when I added home theater it was a must have to upgrade to DVD instead of VHS.  The concert is amazing, the sound quality is 5 star.  Since this I have added all the other concerts and this was my favorite.  I would love to be able to find a dvd of live at Prince Albert Hall.
0143038419|4.0|This book came to me at a time when I was open to its message. In that regard, I highly recommend this book. It is about the voyage of the self. I am envious of her journeys and hope one day to have my own year outside of the US without a care.<br /><br />As for those considering this reading, a few things to note:<br />First, you should most likely be in a place in your life where you are looking for inspiration.<br /><br />Second, don't be expect too much out of this book.  It's inspirational, but it's not a work from some other worldly plain of existence.  It's the right book for vacation or for a relaxing read.<br /><br />Third, I find that those who have gone through divorce, romantic trauma, or otherwise, need a little encouragement with respect to their romantic and career life, love this piece.<br /><br />If you do not like these types of books, lower your expectations and read with an open mind and heart.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Let me preface this by saying I read the novel way before the film was released. The book was all right, if relatively inaccurate about historical plot points. It is indeed a work of fiction based on people who lived, so you take the good with the bad. But the film? Half of it didn't even follow its own source material, let alone ANY of the actual history of Anne and Mary Boleyn!    Trying to cram several decades of events into two hours is challenging, but throwing away important points is the result of terrible script writing. Eric Bana is awful as Henry VIII; he captures none of the drama and power and majesty of the real man. Natalie Portman is decent as Anne Boleyn, but there is still something lacking in her performance. Scarlett Johansson was pretty much only there to be just that, pretty. The rest of the actors and actresses were relatively miss-cast as well. They seemed to be phoning in their performances.    But the worst part was the historical inaccuracies portrayed by this film. Some of the most stand-out ones being:    Mary allegedly hopping directly into bed with Henry VIII and skipping the fact that she was originally sent to the French court (where she was allegedly the mistress of the King of France for a time.) Anne had also been at the French court; she was never \\"banished\\" there. She was actually there when Mary started her affair with Henry VIII!    The \\"Henry VIII fell down a ravine and got hurt!\\" bit? Totally made up.    Mary had two children during her time at the English court. Catherine and Henry were never officially announced as Henry VIII's bastards; it was only implied later on.    Anne and Mary were never close. It is believed that Mary was actually the elder sister and Anne the youngest. It wasn't until after the affair with Mary that Henry VIII took any interest in Anne. And Henry VIII never banished Mary at Anne's wishes.    That bit where Catherine of Aragon confronted Anne and Mary? NEVER HAPPENED!    Mary married William Stafford in secret, shortly after Anne became Queen and gave birth to her daughter Elizabeth, but as soon as the secret was found out, Mary was disowned by her family and the couple was banished from court. Mary was virtually penniless and begged Thomas Cromwell to speak on her behalf to Anne and Henry VIII. None in her family would help her; Anne eventually took some pity on Mary and sent her some money but refused to receive her at court.    Mary NEVER begged Henry VIII to spare Anne's life. She never attended Anne or George's executions and never returned to court. Nor did Mary raise her niece Elizabeth. She most likely never even saw Elizabeth, as the future queen was raised at Hatfield House.    Honestly, this movie was terrible. It was almost as if the script writer wrote plot points on slips of paper and drew them out of a hat, then cobbled the script together with droll dialogue. They couldn't even get the scenery right. Why must Hollywood screw up something that's actually documented? History is far more entertaining than fiction!    If you want to watch something quality with decent attempts to be historically accurate (although with its own faults) I suggest you pick up Seasons 1 and 2 of HBO's \\"The Tudors\\". Beautifully cast, great acting, fantastic script writing, only minor inaccuracies in places. Skip \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" entirely!

0385341008|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society isn't destined to be listed among the classics, but it is a wonderful book.  It's setting is the English Channel island of Guernsey just after World War II.  Juliet Ashton, an author living in London receives a letter from Mr. Dawsey Adams, a pig farmer who lives on Guernsey and who now owns a book that once belonged to her.  He writes to ask if she knows of a bookshop in London that might have another book by the same author and happens to mention that he is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  Thus begins a series of letters between Dawsey and Juliet, Juliet and her publisher, Sidney Stark, Juliet and Sidney's sister, Sophie, Juliet and the various members of the Society and so on and so on.<br /><br />The book is written not as a straight-forward story but as the letters sent from one character to another...a different approach, but through it we come to know each character in a more interesting way.  There is something so personal about reading a letter, something of a person's character, their personality, their soul that isn't always obvious otherwise.  Telephones, emails and text messages may have forever ruined our ability to compose intelligent, witty, heart-felt correspondence to one another, and it is exactly those qualities that I found so appealing about this book.<br /><br />I also enjoy coming away from a book having felt like I learned something in the process.  I have to admit I didn't even know that there were islands in the English Channel, and I certainly didn't know that those islands were the only bit of English soil occupied by the Germans during the war.  Having names like Guernsey and Jersey, I assumed that there was some sort of bovine history there also, and there is...both breeds first being recorded in about 1700 on their respective islands.<br /><br />If you're up for an easy sweet story that has a little bit of romance and a little bit of humor, do yourself a favor and read this wonderful little book.derful little book.

B00260HH3K|2.0|Hey, let's kick some more dirt on this one! So what does it say about a movie when, in talking about it, you open with the caveat: \\"If you'd just lower your expectations...\\"? DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION happens to fall (plummet?) into this awkward category. Me, I know diddly squat about Dragonball or Dragonball Z, other than they feature dudes with funky spiky hair (but don't all animes?). So I walked into the theater with not much of a preconceived notion. Then I walked out, shaking my head and thinking that this film sucketh more than my working girl pal Back Alley Sally (down at the corner of Hollywood and Vine; she takes coupons).<br /><br />I knew I was in for a horrible when, in the early moments, the camera cuts to a bead of sweat dripping in meaningful slow motion from some guy's nose. Then it's on to the petulant teen getting martial arts instruction from his adoptive Asian grandfather. Young Son Goku (Justin Chatwin) is well-versed in assskickery but he's been self-controlled all his life and allows his school mates to rag and bully him. Things change on his 18th birthday, when his grandfather presents him with an odd orange orb called a dragon ball and tells him there are only six others like it.<br /><br />Shockingly (but not really) the grandfather is murdered, and then it's on for the quest to save the world. Two thousand years ago the world was nearly destroyed by the otherworldy menaces Lord Piccolo and his disciple Ozaru. Now Lord Piccolo is back, all green and destructive and vaguely looking like that smoldering English vampire from BUFFY. The only way to stop him is for Goku to gather all the dragon balls, at which point a dragon emerges to grant one perfect wish. Along the way, Goku picks up folks to help him. Emmy Rossum is miscast and just sounds wrong as the beautiful inventor Bulma. Chow Yun-Fat, embarrassingly over-the-top, shows up in a Hawaiian shirt as Goku's mentor, Master Roshi, and Pat Morita really needs to climb out of his grave to slap the sifu out of him. Somewhere, I can feel John Woo carefully distancing himself. And there's some unmemorable young Asian guy playing a mercenary-minded bad boy. I'm frankly startled the world got saved.<br /><br />I'll say this, the martial arts stuff is fairly cool (Chatwin's stunt double has got mad skills), and I even dug the near futuristic setting. And that pretty much sums up stuff that I liked. There's much here that's incoherent and painful and just dang silly. Philosophical conceits get bandied about, leading to irritatingly cryptic lines like \\"To be at one with myself, I must be two.\\" DRAGONBALL: EVOLUTION is what happens when Hollywood goes the cynical \\"Let's just cash in, eff the fans\\" route. As mentioned, I don't know much about the original manga and the anime version, but I have friends who went all howling apenuts about this movie. They were pretty cheesed. But, strictly as a movie goer, I say there are other things to slam, putting to the side the extreme dis to Dragon Ball's manga mythos and continuity.<br /><br />The biggest detractor is the acting. It's as if all the actors involved knew going in that this was already a lost cause and so just didn't bring their best mojo. Justin Chatwin is... not good. I had qualms when I first learned that they'd cast a white dude for the part of Goku. It's like Scott Wolf in DOUBLE DRAGON all over again, in the sense that the guy is just totally wrong for the part. Justin Chatwin has the charisma of my third toenail. And his line delivery is so wooden that even William Shatner is saying, \\"Oh, hell, no!\\" (\\"My grandfather is dead. He.. was murdered. I... will... avenge him.\\").<br /><br />I have no wish to dis on James Marsters, who was so awesome as Spike. But he's so bogged down here by shoddy dialogue and layers of green make-up that he never had a chance.<br /><br />The only one who leaves a good impression is that Asian girl who plays Chi Chi, Goku's love interest. It's a good thing her hotness supersedes hercharacter's crappalicious name. When I think of a name like \\"Chi Chi,\\" images of ugly little poodles and old Puerto Rican pro golfers come up, and I'm not turned on.<br /><br />It's amusing in a way that one of the dragon balls just so happens to be in the hole that Goku and pals had fallen into. And then, sooner than you'd think, it's like the film writers, I guess feeling that even their slapdash approach requires too much effort, just gave up and called it a day because, out of the blue, Bulma informs the rest that Piccolo had just gotten a hold of the remaining four dragon balls. Ta-da! No more scurrying around looking for dragon balls! This quest sucks! If I want airbending techniques, I'd just scarf a bean burrito.character's crappalicious name.

1439138311|1.0|I should warn of spoilers but there is so little to spoil. Such a gray and lifeless story. Eilis is a dull, unlikeable girl. She's prissy, duplicious, selfish, and has no self-awareness (poor Tony...saddled with her for life!). She is a static character...as passive at the end as she is in the beginning. When she goes back to Ireland, people SAY she's changed but it's just her American clothes and her tanned skin. Things are different with her mother but it's because Rose isn't there. The situation has changed, not Eilis. If she didn't want to marry Tony, she shouldn't have. If she wanted to stay in Ireland, she should have told Miss Kelley to suck it. Having read other Irish authors, I have a sense of the damage gossip could do in a small village and how the weight of a community's disapproval could crush someone, but none of that was touched on here. Perhaps Toibin thinks we've all read Maeve Binchey and understand the threat Miss Kelley was implying.     I kept waiting for something to happen. Would the priest take advantage or her? Would she develop a passion for law? Would she find pleasure with another woman? Would she be caught up in the struggle for civil rights? So much potential. Not that every story needs big themes and noisy action but then why the tedious description of her law class or the build up to the \\"coloureds\\" coming to the store? Even the dressing room scene with Miss Fortini barely registers...it's neither embarrassing or provocative. I get the feeling that Toibin was writing down a family story. Like most personal histories, it's a story essentially lacking in drama. But this is a novel! Maybe he felt it would be disrespectful to take the story beyond the facts? As for portraying a vibrant and changing community, well, even the scenes at Coney Island and Dodger Stadium were flat. Save your money. Save your time. Skip Brooklyn.

B001PJRAUS|2.0|*Do not read this is you do not wish to be spoiled*    I didn't like it.     it just seemed weird and odd that these character I love, their personalities are different & they're doing things they wouldn't do and things were twisted.    It's hard to explain :P    Mr & Mrs Bennet have an unhappy marriage.   Mr Wickham is actually good? And Caroline Bingley is a lesbian? Mr Bingley becomes a drunk? That is not what Jane Austen wrote. they can't just change that! It is supposed to be about a girl who stumbles into the world of Pride & Prejudice. Not a world where the Pride & Prejudice characters are not what they seem.     I also hated when they wanted to get a cheap laugh out of us in some parts. Like when Mr Darcy is on the bus and sees a child reading a tellytubbie book & then later sees a telly tubby doll and exclaims \\"Tinky Winky!\\" Not a very Mr Darcy thing to do. And the lesbian scene where Caroline Bingley confesses she is a lesbian.     I hated the ending. Elisabeth run off to the modern world unstead of being with Darcy, Amanda agree to marry her boyfriend & then run off with Darcy leaving him broken & without an explanation & Lady Catherine miraculously promises to Divorce Mr Collins & Jane.     The whole thing felt so strange that by the time Mr Bennet gets stabbed in the neck and is dying I realise I no longer care & I feel like switching it off. These were not the characters I've loved since my teens. Theses were modernised, depressing, twisted, cheap, cast offs and I didn't care about them one bit.     The only character I still liked was Jane. That was only because they didn't change her in anyway & that she was missing for half the show!     It was truely a strange experience watching this. It was a good idea and I looked forward to it and shunned bad reviews that I read before I watched it and I was even more keen about this than the idea of \\"Pride & Prejudice an zombies\\". But now I'm disapointed.     I give it an two stars for location & costumes.

0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games was easily my favorite book of all times, so when I got my hands on Catching Fire, I was both full of anticipation, and wariness. Could this sequel hold water compared to it's powerful predecessor, could it hold a candle to the burning beginning of our amazing tale?<br /><br />It could, by god, it could. Catching Fire was as good, if not better, as the Hunger Games. Just as stunning, just as powerful, just as shocking.<br />Shocking. The best way to describe Suzanne Collins style in my opinion. Every turn of the page, there was a different emotion. Horror, intriguement, depression, whimsicality, and a charade of more complex feelings and thoughts. Words leapt off the page, made me yelp, made me cry, made me smile, made me angry at this or that character.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' writing style is that powerful, that it can easily toy with your emotions, adding to the affect of the book. An affect, one of horror at the Capital, and one of shared bravery and struggles with the main character, that's added to by the powerful story line. A story that's hard to forget, hard to walk away from.<br />When you put this book down, you'll still see it. You'll still be amazed about every single twist and turn, still be so enthralled with Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and the new comers in this story. When you put it down, all you'll have left is the lust for the next book, wonderment as to where the story will go.<br /><br />It's just that good.<br />Catching Fire is easily the best book I have ever read, and if I was every to write something, I would wish for the gift of a style similar to Collins. I just can't get over how well it's worded, how every statement has me reeling.<br /><br />Tell you what, I definitely recommend it.
B00000K3UU|3.0|It wasn't bad. It wasn't good either. I was just mediocre. Some of the jokes fell flat, and some others didn't. The gay jokes were too overwhelming, while the kid jokes were spot on. Sandler, Schneider, Buscemi, and others really did a good job with their performances. Even though I can't stand the Sprouse brothers, they did very well as Julian. So yes, Big Daddy was just okay, not good nor bad. It's not as strong and downright hilarious as Sandler's other films like The Waterboy and Billy Madison, so don't count on a laugh-out-loud experience here.<br /><br />Grade: C

We were addicted to Sookie and the mysteries that surrounded that Louisiana town.    The stories were all tantalizing, exciting, moreish and left us aching for season 2. The only reason I don't give this series 5 stars is because there was a little too much sex for my liking. I don't need to see boobs and loud moans and groans and people having intercourse in every episode. If you are not into gratuitous sex scenes you may not like this series as much.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|Third being Portishead 3rd studio album and their 2008 album was an album that I had been waiting to listen to for a long time and when I did I was very disappointed. Most of the tracks sound like demo versions or tracks that were discarded on earlier albums. The sound is muffled and the lyrics make no sense at all. The booklet is very sparse with no lyrics and no listing of whom played what. Many critics liked this album, however, I must admit that this was a major letdown. 2/5.

0439023483|4.0|Suzanne Collins writes for children and about children, but her themes, of the effects of poverty and class and war on the minds of the young and the needy, are not at all juvenile or simplistic.  My children and I loved her Underland Chronicles (beginning with [[ASIN:0439678137 Gregor The Overlander]]) and this new series, whose world is both more complex (in part because it is less fantasy and more like a palpable and possible future) and more dangerous, this new series starts out strong with as much intensity as the last installment of Gregor, and if the beginning is anything to go by the series as a whole promises to be even richer and more intense.<br /><br />Katniss is a survivor, a young hunter who has struggled her whole life to keep her family from starvation, from the time her father died and her mother essentially stopped living.  She lives in a post-apocalyptic future, in a poor colony among twelve colonies that are managed through fear by an autocratic centralized government.  To ensure the feeling of subjugation and of the futility of resistance on the part of the colonies, the rulers hold an annual contest, forcing children from each colony to come to the capital and fight to the death, in a kind of gladiatorial survivor reality show, survivor takes all.  When her younger sister is selected to fight, Katniss volunteers to take her place and finds herself opposite a considerate boy her age who once did her a kindness, who she would hate to harm.  The real question as the games proceed is whether in such a situation Katniss can keep her humanity, or whether her struggle to survive and to protect her family will kill her soul.<br /><br />It's a very intriguing story, in a very intriguing world, that turns out to be not so different from our own.  It's also a gripping read.  Once I got into it I couldn't put it down.  It's not for younger children -- while it's not quite [[ASIN:B000F4LPJ6 Battle Royale]] it should definitely be classed as young adult rather than juvenile fiction for its violence and disturbing elements -- but it would be a very good book for mature readers to discuss themes of war, violence, class, economics, politics, morality, and entertainment.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that only comes around once every decade or so. There is really no way that you could knock a movie like this. Beautiful acting, direction, cinematography, and even gives a nod to Les Miserable near the end, and that deffinitly makes it a big winner in my book. Did I mention the symbolism? Steven King did such a masterful job on not only directing, but touching on deep themes on race, purigatory, and what it truly means to be free (and this is just a scratch on the surface compared to everything Shawshank tries to say).     Movies at this calibar are extremely hard to find, but even harder not to love every single minute. At a steal for eight dollars, there's no reason why Shawshank Redemption should  be overlooked by any movie goer.

0385340567|2.0|I discovered the Reacher novels a few months ago, bought the first 5 in hardback, really liked them, so bought all the rest in hardback. I've now read them all in order (just finished #13, which is quite an improvement over this one, #12). The series is just a bit uneven, but overall up through #11 I still enjoyed them all, usually finishing each in a few nights' worth of compulsively turning the pages. (Even an average Reacher book was better than many other books I've read for fun.)    Nothing to Lose was disappointing -- not the worst book I've ever read, but nowhere near the standards of the others. The story itself just isn't that interesting -- Reacher keeps going back and forth between two towns that are named in a cartoonish way that seems beneath the Reacher books. The plot is odd and unbelievable. I know that some suspension of belief is often required in these kinds of books, but when I ask myself, \\"why is Reacher doing what he's doing?,\\" that's a problem.    My biggest problem with the book, though, was that not only was Reacher doing things that seemed idiotic, he was also SAYING things that seemed a complete reversal of what he had said and thought in 11 previous books. In the interest of full disclosure, let me say that I grew up in the military (although the Air Force, not Reacher's Army) and so I really enjoy the military details in these books while sharing Reacher's feelings about the great aspects of the military as well as the problems (e.g. incredible bureaucracy). Now Reacher has decided that military DESERTERS are OK with him? No way. He wouldn't feel that way (especially after meeting the police officer's husband!). And maybe it's arrogant of me to feel like I know what Reacher would say more than Lee Child does, but come on -- the words coming out of Reacher's mouth were just bizarre and very annoying.    Overall disappointing, although I didn't give up on the series and went on to #13, which I finished in 2 nights and really liked. Hopefully #14 will stay on track.
0743455967|4.0|Stephen King. The name brings forth one of three general responses: 1) \\"Oh, I love him!\\" 2) \\"Oh, no!\\" Or 3) \\"Oh . . . Okay.\\" I fell into the third group, having never read his work, nor having any urge to. I assumed any author who churned out that many books could not be worth anything, and I lumped him in with the other Wal-Mart novelists. So when I found On Writing was assigned for class I thought, \\"Well, I better read this before school starts.\\" Not only was it King, it was non-fiction, something I typically avoid.   It did not take me long to finish the book. After reading it, I think I would like to read  some of King's fiction. On Writing is not flowery, pretentious, or theory-based. This memoir is a sandwich; his personal narratives are the bread, the meat is his advice on composition. King tells readers ways to improve their writing (apparently, he absolutely hates adverbs) and gives some helpful tips on how to improve grammar, style, and vocabulary (hint: read, read, read! Then read some more). King even gives his readers a list of good books he has read in the past few years. For examples on revision, he provides the rough draft of \\"1408\\" and the edited version.    This book should be especially interesting for King fans; he tells how he came up with ideas for some of his stories, and he recounts parts of his past. We learn how King came into his craft. This is nothing like reading a textbook. It is actually enjoyable, a light, easy read all the way through.

Certainly he weaves the possible origins into the plot but I found the main thrust to be a commentary on extrasensory perception and similar powers.<br /><br />Simply put; we can't POSSIBLY fully understand it as human beings.<br /><br />And, of course, I was hooked by the disclaimer.  Those of you who have read this wonderful book understand why.<br /><br />In the end, I couldn't quite give this work 5 stars.  It's the same reason I take 1/2 star off for all his works; sometimes he just meanders and I find myself wondering if the plot points in a particular chapter could have been developed elsewhere.<br /><br />Of course, I have no idea where \\"elsewhere\\" might be ...
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Now this is definately one of those concepts that may invite the standard issue \\"this is REAL music\\" kind of reviews. It appears everything is sort of level headed on that front so far in that department. But that isn't my point. I have a friend in California. We talk about music all the time and this is an album and an artist we come to frequenty.I've reviewed Al Green here before and will do so again,hopefully many times. So here I am going to put my two cents on this. Al Green is one of those people whose voice is so elastic and expressive that it actually merrits it's own sound. So much so that even though the Dap Kings as opposed to the HI rhythm section are the musicians on this.....the song,as it were remains the same.?uestlove,producer of this album understood that and a lot more going into this project because he's not only a fan of Al's but also understands the way in which he adapts his vocals into the band who are playing with him.Now I don't know for sure but on the title track alone I get the impression that Al is definately mic'd up,meaning that he's not being fed into the console. It's a technique he used a lot on his classic 70's recordings. But either way around it the appeal of this album is easy to think about for the most part but kind of hard for me to put into words. It just......has the Al Green sound. Only the most talented ones have it. James Brown had a \\"sound\\".Prince has a \\"sound\\" and...so does Al. With him....all the instrumentalists just fall into place EXACTLY where they should. Doesn't sound too deliberately natural,isn't trying to be ultra edgy. But Al's emotional,reflective vocal licks in place with the other musicians always know where they belong in each song. And big time kudos to ?uestlove for realizing that. After all updating Al with heavy modern techno/hip-hop considerations would just be a tremendous musical imbalance on every front. And besides when you hear songs like \\"I'm Wild About You\\",\\"Standing In The Rain\\" and the wonderful \\"You've Got The Love I Need\\" those horns,basslines,organ and rhythm will flow right through you so well you'll be as much involved in the whole musical experience as Al is. True this album is not about making hits but rather presenting Al Green as a person with a distinctive \\"sweet funk\\" sound rather than a formula. Does he stick to it like glue the way..(hey sorry I like him too) Van Morrison does now and again?Not on your LIFE! But Al,?uestlove,The Dap Kings,John Legend,Anthony Hamilton and everyone involved in this album bring out it's best qualities on all fronts.e Rain\\" and the wonderful \\"You've Got The Love I Need\\" those horns,basslines,organ and rhythm will flow right through you so well you'll be as much involved in the whole musical experience as Al is.

B001U0HBPG|3.0|***********SPOILER ALERT*************    First of all, let me start with the positive aspects of the film. It is technically brillant. The scenes with Tilda Swinton(always good) in Russia were excellent--wish there had been more of them.     Now for the negative:    1. I read that the director was intent on not making an overly sentimental film--big      mistake considering the subject matter. For example--when Benjamin finally dies      as a baby--Daisy doesn't even shed a single tear. I know an argument can be made      that she lost him a long time ago as he became \\"younger\\" and senility crept in.      But even so, when you finally do lose the love of your life. why not look at him      and say \\"goodbye\\" and cry a little--as he is gone forever?    2. The chemistry between Benjamin and Daisy was curiously lacking. When they finally     \\"meet in the middle\\" and have a life together--why not show more scenes of them      being happy and what attracted them to one another? The early childhood scenes      were touching---but---we as an audience needed more to convince us they really      were in love.    3. The hospital scenes went on and on and on. Some serious editing was clearly      needed here. I always hated when we left the main story to go \\"back\\" to the      hospital story--except for the parentage revealing scene.    4. Brad Pitt seemed to be \\"walking through\\" his role. I know he was nominated for      an Academy Award for this--but this is not his best role. Probably not his      fault---the fault lies within the screenplay--as we never \\"connect\\" with      Benjamin.                            Alas, everybody's a critic.
0743496736|4.0|I just have to reiterate what others have said. I enjoyed the book and found myself unable to put it down after I got into it. It took awhile to be able to connect with some of the characters. I found myself feeling more compassion for Peter, which I guess is the point of it all. I didn't care for Josie's character and choices, but could understand her need for acceptance. I have to agree that the ending was forced for the sake of having a twist. I knew it was coming because of certain hints along the way. The ending just stopped the flow of the story and was not in character with Josie's prior behavior. It just didn't fit and make sense and unfortunately ruined the book for me. I preferred \\"My sister's Keeper\\" and though that ending devasted me, it was believable.
B000002UAR|3.0|Spoiler warning...I am not concerned with presenting this album in its historical context nor in explaining it in terms of the time in which it was released nor have I even researched at all what the musicians themselves have said about this album...I am responding to it here from my own imaginative perspective. Released a year before I was born, I probably was first exposed to the Beatles by my summertime babysitter in the 70s and who loved the Beatles. Not until the early 80s did my own appreciation for rock and pop first develop. I eventually traced back through the work of those artists that I enjoyed and admired and rediscovered the phenomenon that is the Beatles!<br /><br />This album is largely a collection of portraits of people or moments caught in music either profoundly suited to the lyrical content or not so much. Each song is never more than three minutes long so even with 14 songs you may find this album over sooner than you would expect. There is also a heavy strain of what could be interpreted as a naive attitude towards the glories of drugs and their effects that might offend those who know now all too well the profound suffering that addiction can cause.<br /><br />Taxman - Tight rocker spelling out how tax collectors are right up there with lawyers and repo men...good ironic humor. Lyrics from the perspective of the evil taxman to a guitar riff that upholds the aggressive indifference of the said taxman's intentions.<br /><br />Eleanor Rigby - Haunting string instruments march you through elegant portraits of people living in quiet desperation; lyrics portray them without rescuing them; \\"Ah! Look at all the lonely people!\\" one of the more evocative chorus' ever sung<br /><br />I'm Only Sleeping - First of a number of songs taken from moments in the life of a drug user. Good, laid-back shuffle about being sleepy-high and not wanting to be bothered.<br /><br />Love You To - Strikes me as being sincerely influenced by traditional Indian music. The exotic instrumentation is hypnotic and augments the lyrics drug-induced perspective<br /><br />Here, There and Everywhere - Sounds like a quiet, humble love song on a still, lazy day...could be about getting high! Hard to tell sometimes (see Dr. Roberts, he'll hook you up!). Or could it be akin to the Police's \\"Every Breath You Take\\" which is really a song about a stalker!<br /><br />Yellow Submarine - Who needs drugs when you have...imagination! If you don't sing along you will feel like you are missing out. How else are you going to get to see the \\"Octopus' Garden\\"? Great song effects enhance the fun and adventure on this classic that caught my attention as a child.<br /><br />She Said She Said - Referring to the same woman as in \\"She's So Heavy\\"? Upbeat tune but really a great description of getting your mind blown or your reality shattered.<br /><br />Good Day Sunshine - Carefree once again...the innocence of this song and its appreciation of a good moment bring some lightness into some of the murky darkness of previous songs...in terms of mood it makes a great contrast to the previous song.<br /><br />And Your Bird Can Sing - I really like the guitar in this song; I've read that it is Lennon and Harrison playing together.  Nice long melodic phrase...<br /><br />For No One - Another character sketch with a catchy, quiet clavichord and horn accompaniment<br /><br />Dr. Roberts - This song is about the drug dealer we should be harranging perhaps rather than the taxman...reflects the \\"Taxman\\"'s strong guitar line but is less aggressive in tone<br /><br />I Want To Tell You - Catchy song elegantly creates the mood of having something that you wanted to say but not being able to get it out...the music travels in circles too as if trying to find something...perhaps there is a theme throughout the album of being lost or found...<br /><br />Got To Get You Into My Life - About love (or lust) or about LSD? You decide.<br /><br />\\"I was alone, I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there\\"<br /><br />Uplifting brass makes this a catchy song, a wishful desire to see something good come along.<br /><br />Tomorrow Never Knows - Mystical summary, perhaps, of the existential and potentially perilous moments this album has sketched. Sitar and tape loops create a \\"revolving\\" chaos that perhaps this album is meant to unfold in individual sketches like some \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" made by young and rebellious artists of the age. This song has the richest most complex rhythm and stands out in this respect far above the other songs.<br /><br />(1 star) The songs may be a bit short to more deeply capture my attention but these are high quality pop and rock songs. \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" would make good additions to a progressive rock collection as these songs are precursors to the more fantastic or artfully constructed places that prog songs try and take us to.atchy song, a wishful desire to see something good come along.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is a different movie from the one released in theaters.  You get an excellent feel for what Scott really wanted to do with this film.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, the extra footage is well worth the price.
6304230109|5.0|I just want to say that I have been an Alice fan since the early 90's and followed them all the way. This DVD is a must have for fans. Layne was evidently in such bad shape but that did not take away from that powerful voice. He was an amazing vocalist--and several times throughout you could tell that Jerry was pleased that Layne was sounding excellent. He may have made the mistake on \\"SludgeFactory\\"(one of my all time favorites of the show) but the emotion he conveyed afterwards really made it for me. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Layne Staley was the best vocalist to me and always will be. RIP sweetie.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums by one of the best bands of all time. The music will not only calm you down, but it will also make you happy or make you cry or make you fall in love. Any way you want to take it, this is a beautiful album with beautiful music.<br /><br />I truly love every song on this album. There is no other album in the world like that.<br /><br />What you must do is listen to the lyrics (which isn't hard). These will speak to your soul and touch you on some of the most basic human level. My personal favorites are \\"Soul Meets Body,\\" \\"What Sarah Said,\\" \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark,\\" \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan,\\" and \\"Crooked Teeth.\\" (Yes, that's half the album). These lyrics can speak to you and make you think about your life. I sometimes sing these songs when I feel that the lyrics are what I feel.<br /><br />These songs will not leave you--they connect to one's soul in ways that very few musicians can accomplish. Definitely a must-have.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams (HBO Miniseries) is a most beautiful depiction of American History presenting the trials, tribulations and joys experienced by Our Founding Fathers during their passionate pursuits to develop a Free Nation and ultimately implementing The Constitution of the United States of America, as her Foundation.     American History, as seen through the eyes of John Adams, the first  Vice-President of the United States to General George Washington and America's second President, is portrayed by brilliant and most believable actors (especially John Adams and his wife, Abigal) in magnificant, realistic scenery - a pleasurable way to learn facts of the birthing of this Great American Nation.    Intimate presentation of their united struggles to secure personal freedoms and dignity, their own, and for those of all future citizens, leaves one with a much deeper appreciation and genuine love for Our Founding Father's unselfish and tireless efforts.    For anyone like me, who slept through History 101, promise this film keeps your eyes wide open and instills a longing for more knowledge, facts and more History of the United States of America.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This show has surprised me repeatedly, forced me to care way too much about the complex and true-to-life characters, and drawn me into a world that never interested me before.  The level of talent in both production and performance is unmatched and far superior to anything else I have seen on television.  The dvds don't disappoint, with plenty of commentary and discussion of the lore behind the show.  I purchased the Target version as it has an additional disc with a small amount of content for no extra cost.  If you have never watched Supernatural, do yourself a favor and get all four seasons.  You will not be sorry.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Well, I promised myself I'd get me these DVDs as a gift when I finished my youtube video about G-rated shock value ([...])and I ended up doing just that.  I actually like these movies better than the original three.  Not for the special effects, but for the tragic hero story of Darth Vader's broken love and his turn to the Dark Side.  Revenge of the Sith is really the only movie you need to see to get an idea of how this turn took place, but the first two films do add a bit more depth as to how it started small and slowly grew until something had to give.<br /><br />Of course the characters and space monsters are as weird as ever and provide a lot of enjoyment.  It might be a bit tough to enjoy Phantom Menace at first since the vast majority of its characters are so far removed from the Luke Skywalker films.  But Darth Maul is 10 times cooler than Luke Skywalker anyway.<br /><br />The plots are a bit confusing, especially since a lot of things are talked about but not shown.  We only see bits and fragments of the clone wars, so I'm guessing that's why the animated stuff came about later.  We hear of the people starving on Naboo but don't see anything to give us a sympatheic impression of such horror.<br /><br />I suppose it wouldn't hurt to give some story spoilers since everyone's seen these darn movies, but eh, I only wanted to talk about Boba Fett and the storm troopers anyway.  Not much to say, so I guess I'll be good this time.

B000H5TH1Q|2.0|I could figure it as a potential setup from the beginning, that Wasson's clueless character Jake Scully was about to be exploited badly. The compelling nature of the visuals and the overly strong soundtrack (overwhelming, like bad strong perfume) kept me watching, because you knew something was going to happen...unfortunately it was so transparently stupid, so entirely based on Scully's cluelessness, that it never really transcends the stupid.<br /><br />Unmotivated action in spades: Scully coincidentally just running into people he is supposed to be set up to meet, in a way no setup artist could anticipate or control, and therefore the entire big setup plot could have exploded right there; Scully taking the soon-to-be-murdered-woman's discarded underwear when she throws it away in a public place for no reason (why in the world did she discard it anyway, except to entice him, which should have tipped him off); almost having sex with this woman in a tunnel, after suffering a traumatic bout of his claustrophobia, and she doesn't even mind his groping and kissing, until just suddenly, OK, she really minds (time for a change of underwear again, I guess, and another trip to the mall) and decides she can't do this after all (????); later, his not calling the police immediately when he unmistakably sees this woman being murdered...this, and other puerile and contrived ideas, keep this movie in the bottom of the IQ area.<br /><br />Once it gets somewhat interesting (after the raunchy porno stuff and the amusing Melanie Griffith), it simply becomes a movie I find impossible to follow. I can't pull the \\"auteuresque\\" threads together, except for the obvious one (the husband of the murdered woman set Jake Scully up, and knew just how stupid and vulnerable he was). I don't get the movie. I don't care about the Hitchcock ripoffs; at least those gave the movie some momentum. The rest of it is just blood and salacious enticement. Just another male sex fantasy gone unedited for themost part and made into a movie. Seriously. Skip it, unless you like that stuff. Which some people do.<br /><br />Also, I don't see it as mysogynist. Instead, I see it as a movie that demonstrates, over and over again, through its slimy lens, that it sees men as stupid, and predictable, and that they can be conned sooooo easily. Is that what DePalma set out to do? Perhaps this movie is a warning to men...<br /><br />If I were a man, I would find this movie rather depressing.
B002M5ZCEU|2.0|I love Whitney and I prayed and pulled for her comeback.  I wanted her to show the singers who come out of the can what a pro sounds like.  Yes, I am totally disappointed in this album, but not for how she sounds -- I understand the (eventual) demise of every instrument.  My disappointment is in the fact that as great as Clive Davis is, he couldn't come up with a real songwriter for Whitney.  Whitney needed a Diane W., David Foster-type writers.  When you use Alicia Keys (she has her place in music) and R. Kelly, you get teeny-bopper and yodeling lyrics, respectively.  I don't understand why they didn't use folks who have paid their dues in songwriting!  Folks who write but don't (try) sing.  I think it would have made a huge difference in this CD. Also, there is no justification for an \\"Akon-type\\" with a Whitney-type.  Yes, I'll buy the CD because I have to support \\"The Voice\\", but I'm not happy about the attempt to \\"refresh\\" Whitney with genres that do not do her justice! All that being said, even on a bad day, Whitney still puts our canned singers and entertainers to shame -- as long as she doesn't try to dance.
B000XG5J0M|5.0|As I write this review in September 2009, there are only 5-star reviews.  Nothing less.  There's a reason for that.  World Without End truly IS that good.<br /><br />The other reviewers speak of the narrator, John Lee, who also performed on Mr. Follett's The Pillars of the Earth, which by the way is being made into a TV mini-series and is a book related to World Without End, though both books can be enjoyed separately, i.e., don't think of the two books as a series. I have listened to hundreds of audio books.  It is clear to me why John Lee was chosen to do the narration, i.e., he is one of the best; a true professional actor-quality narrator.<br /><br />You can read the two books (The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End) in any order, though I did Pillars first since it was released first, which I thought was unbelievable...until I read World Without End...and I'm not sure if I have the words to explain how much I enjoyed it. If you have not started either one yet, go ahead and get the audio of Pillars first and then follow it up with World.<br /><br />Because I have many books to read, both for enjoyment and technical, I chose to listen to the book, instead of reading it.  And, I really feel that you will enjoy the audio of this book.  Whether you read the book or listen to the book, prepare yourself to become transported hundreds of years back in time when, if you were not of noble birth, you had a very difficult time, indeed.  Also, if you have any emotions at all, prepare yourself to laugh, cry, want to scream, and even want to kill.  Mr. Follett opens our eyes to many issues in this book.  His research, as always, is well done.  World Without End is a powerhouse of a book, and I personally feel that this book places Mr. Follett in the select group of the truly great authors of all time.S: BUY THIS AUDIO BOOK.
B0007R4TAS|5.0|Jane Eyre has always been one of my favorite movies and the George C. Scott version proves to be the best.  I love it  I was surprised how quickly I received my copy. The price was surprisingly reasonable. It arrived in excellent  condition.  I will be purchasing more hard-to-find DVD's in the future.
B00003CXSM|5.0|A great movie.  I applaud romance between two people with principles - honoring present commitment without the usual unnecessary sexual encounters - yet showing the physical attraction.  (The scene with the statue is worth the price all by itself).  Would love to see a part two with Jenifer and Matthew as a couple.

0385342020|2.0|After reading all of the author's other books (Confessions of a Shopaholic, etc), I was a bit let down with this one.  I found the other books to be hysterical and found it hard to put them down.  This one, not so much.  It was cute and light hearted...but did not quite compare to the others.
0446618306|1.0|Yes, I read it and yes, I wanted to see how things happened. With the beginning I just knew it wasn't going to work out, yet I kept thinking that maybe the Dear John letter wasn't the end. Realistic? No. Desirable? No. Sad? Not really. By the end I thought the story was just too much schmaltz. My book club loved it (or so they say), not me.  I've read better by Nicholas Sparks.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is absolutely eye opening. Never before did I look at lables or where what came from, as much as after watching this movie.    Now I am eating better food.

Everyone you care about should watch this !!
B000001DWG|5.0|I think it might be hard to appreciate this without an understanding of the musical context of the late 80's. MTV was full of hair metal bands and the beginnings of hip hop. Mother Love Bone was so different -- a throw back to the 70's but at the same time very new and forward. Listening to this now (2009), I can't help but remember the Seattle that existed at the time and feel very sad that it's gone.
0321544080|5.0|As a visual designer who mainly works in 3D to create images I still believe that a firm grip on principles of photography will help lift my work to a new level. The same concepts of composition and lighting are valid in the real world as in the virtual world of 3D graphics.<br /><br />Joe's direct way of how he tackles a subject, topic or assigment is very inspirational and makes me want to head out and photograph immediately.<br /><br />There is very little of technical talk in this book and for me that's a great thing. Joe tells how he goes about getting a look and feel in a language that non professional photographers can immediately pick up on and bring into practice.<br /><br />The book contains a great series of photographs that have served as opening shots for editorials or cover shots for magazines like Time and National Geographic.<br /><br />If you like looking at great pictures and want to learn a bit about how they came about, this is an excellent book.

I used to own the VHS and when I lost it, it was devistating. The people who came up with this movie, and cast the incredible cast are geniuses. Bette Midler plays a wonderful witch and is amazing. Buy this movie, because if you dont, you will regret it for the rest of your life!

B002EWD08Q|5.0|Although British disco-punk has declined in popularity near the end of the 00s, the Arctic Monkeys are still producing solid music.<br /><br />The band's third album, \\"Humbug,\\" is a psychedelic masterpiece that transforms the pop band into an artistic phenomenon.<br /><br />Whereas other British punk groups have sloppily added electronic instruments to their ensemble, the Arctic Monkey's sound remains largely intact. Aside from the pianos in \\"Fire and the Thud\\" and the organ sound in \\"Pretty Visitors,\\" they still sound like the same band.<br /><br />However, the recording style went through major changes. With help from co-producer Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age, the new album is drenched with dreamy echos and loud bass riffs from Nick O'Malley. Turner's high-pitched voice was also toned down for a more down-to-earth tone.<br /><br />The resulting sound is an irresistable mix between the hazy echos from Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" album and the aggressive punchiness of the indie punk group, Kasabian.<br /><br />Even though it doesn't sound like it should work, the Monkeys make it work miraculously, in true artistic splendor. Matt Helders' drums are more subdued in this album, but his staccato-heavy 4/4 rhythm transforms the rules for punk rock bands. Rather than rely on the typical Green Day-style speed punk rhythm, Helders litters his rhythm with drum rolls, tom tom thumping and cymbal smashing, making for a beat that sounds more or less like hip-hop beats on steroids.<br /><br />The band's new, bass-oriented sound is even more infectious. Songs such as the hit single \\"Crying Lightning\\" sound like a dark '70s noir song, rich with probably the coolest bass riff of the year from O'Malley. Other songs, such as \\"Dangerous Animals,\\" are adrenaline-pumping tracks with a wicked bass line in the chorus.<br /><br />Most of all, Alex Turner's poetic lyrics are unforgettable. There's nothing cooler than hearing Turner sing \\"Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste/You'll have to slip away I am unhappy to say, behold is the crook in the hammock plays.\\" It's an infectious song that turns the slums into a bizarre world, featuring a tramp with a trampoline under his arm and barking alarm which \\"waits, coiled 'till the corner is turned.\\"<br /><br />Despite the heavy criticism of the band from other reviewers, this is definitely the Arctic Monkeys' best album yet. The band has somehow managed to add artistic flair to their sound, without getting carried away with electronic sound effects. Combined with Turner's knack for colorful lyrics, \\"Humbug\\" is one of the best albums of 2009.ve to slip away I am unhappy to say, behold is the crook in the hammock plays.\\" It's an infectious song that turns the slums into a bizarre world, featuring a tramp with a trampoline under his arm and barking alarm which \\"waits, coiled 'till the corner is turned.\\"    Despite the heavy criticism of the band from other reviewers, this is definitely the Arctic Monkeys' best album yet.

B000784WMW|2.0|This adaptation was painful to watch.  First off, it's like your watching a play not a movie.  Secondly, every scene with Timothy Dalton is straight out of 1980's soap opera.  It was all I could do to not laugh out loud.  This version is true to the book, but with none of the passion or sentiment.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone; it was so disappointing.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Crystal Skull\\" more than some of the previous, and it's made even better by the superb captions. Even every piece of the extra stuff that I watched was just as well captioned; a word was changed once in a great while, but not enough to be REALLY annoying. Thanks all!!

This movie was ruined for me because every scene where Rochester's Lunatic wife was around was too much like a horror movie, and for this reason I will not be purchasing this version.  This movie is however 100% better than the 1980's BBC version (it's like a bad soap opera).
0439023491|4.0|With \\"The Hunger Games,\\" Suzanne Collins created a masterpiece. It was one of my favorite books in years, particularly for the YA market, and I eagerly awaited this sequel--after hooking my teenage daughter on the series as well.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" does many things right. We find Katniss and Peeta dealing with their success as a couple and as warriors, while also facing the personal jealousies of Gale and the more public animosity of the Capitol. The encounter with President Snow is understated and chilling. Katniss, Peeta, and Gale are walking on thin ice when it comes to relationships and their own survival. We don't have the humor of Haymitch and Effie this time around, but the characters are as deep as in the first book, with the motivations clearly drawn even as they go on a Victory Tour of the districts and begin to sense the uprising that stirs among the regular citizens.<br /><br />In other ways, though, this book disappointed me. It spends a lot of time letting Katniss wrestle with her new position as a victor, while not yet accepting her role as a possible revolution leader. I truly hoped, even expected, this story to delve into an underground rebellion led by her and Peeta or Gale. There are some final surprises that allow room for this, and there are some fantastic scenes throughout--including Peeta's growing ability to sway the masses--but it feels like we've been teased along for another book.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of this series, and will be first in line to get book three. Nevertheless, both my daughter and I agreed that \\"Catching Fire\\" took a little longer to catch fire than we expected. It's a good second effort, but I can only hope the third book fulfills all the promises and tragedy hinted at in \\"The Hunger Games.\\"
B00002N9ER|4.0|I keep my Maglite clipped to the door of my truck.  With two clips, the light would sometimes bounce out, if I closed the door hard.  I bought a second set of the clips, and added a third clip to hold my 5 cell in place.  It has not come out unintentionally since adding the third clip.  When I grab it in a hurry, it still comes out with a solid tug.  It's nice to have the Maglight where it can be reached in a hurry.

B000001Y5D|5.0|this album is awesome!!! contains known top hits and the not so known compositions of Linda Perry. great singer and song writer, if you don't buy this CD it's your loss.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Sounds good. Yes I know that her voice not the same. But still better any other popular female singers.  Album material very good also, mature and bright. This is the best album of 2009 for me.     I think she worked very hard for this album and deserves to be no 1.
B001GCUO4I|3.0|ok I'm gonna break it down     this was probably the worst of the Final Destination movies but good = 3 stars    the 3-D was pretty good = 4 stars    the blood and gore was good = 5 stars    the killings and dead bodys looked way to fake = 1 star    hated how he could see things that were going to happen through the whole movie instead of noticing clues like in the other 3 movies = 1 star    hated the ending = 1 star    the commercials gave away way to much of the movie, knew what was going to happen with almost every one of them = 1 star
B0027HOBM2|1.0|A word of caution: this has nothing to do with Mad Men or the quality of the show (which is excellent), but the playing of the blu-ray disc is awful.  The second season I purchased on blu-ray disc doesn't have a resume feature, allowing you to go back to the place you were at before you stopped and/or shut down.  This makes it really inconvenient because you have to sit through the ads, the introductions, the Clorox commercial, the legal disclaimers, etc. before you get back to the episode at which you left off -- and then you have to fast-forward to find exactly where you were in the episode, if you can remember where that is!  What a royal pain.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Give me a good, old-fashioned dvd that has the features I want!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Purchased a number of the classic Disney videos for my grandson and as you would expect they are great.
0307266303|5.0|..and I'm not even a runner. The book goes all over the place, but is cleverly hung together and it keeps you interested. Not just about the Tarahumara, but a look into the human activity of running, from a fringe sport to a way of survival. Very interesting!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|It's one of Moore's better movies.  Makes the case for a single-payer health care system.  Convincing.
B001GCUER0|5.0|My wife and are old enough to remember the Mad Men era - it's like watching a documentary.  Thank goodness for feminism.  My wife was so absorbed that she couldn't stop watching until the last episode had finished and then she still wanted more!
B002M5ZCEU|3.0|She is Whitney Houston and, thus, more popular. It's hard for me not to compare the two since Donna Summer is my favorite vocalist and she and Whitney haven't had new releases in quite a few years and now they both do. I am so glad that Whitney has a new set of recordings. She's been through an ordeal and the fact that she's still here says a lot. However, for me, it's all about the vocals and the marriage of those vocals with the music and the story in the lyrics and how it's presented. Based on that, I'm pleased with a few of the new tunes. Namely, \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", \\"Nothin' But Love\\", and \\"Call You Tonight\\". All the other track don't impress me. On some, the background singers seem to be the lead vocalists more so than Whitney does, but that could be because of the limitations of the snippets here on Itunes. As we get older, our voices change a bit and Whitney's has. Obviously, due to some aspects of her personal life, more than age has added to her vocal change, but she still sounds pretty good. Not like the Whitney Houston we first heard years ago, but good nonetheless. I've modified my review a bit, but I'm still leaving it at 3 stars. Donna Summer fans are tough cookies:) At least some buyers on Itunes are also buying the new Donna Summer cd, Crayons, along with the new Whitney. I recommend the three songs previously mentioned.
0783226888|4.0|This film is essentially a modernized remake of the famous film (which was based on the famous novel) \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" by Frederick Forsyth.  It features modern day politics and, of course, modern day technology.  What the film really features, however, is an excellent cast dominated by Bruce Willis, who turns in a superb performance.  Instead of being a kind, sensitive type, as in \\"The Sixth Sense\\" once again Willis is a cold, brutal, and competent killer.  He pulls it off brilliantly, and it is Willis' performance that carries the film.  Sidney Portier and Richard Gere also turn in fine performances.  Gere, in particular, manages to really come across as an Irishman--none of the phony-sounding accents that have grated on several otherwise good performances in other recent films. (Harrison Ford in \\"K19\\" comes immediately to mind).<br /><br />Mostly the film moves at a good clip and holds the viewer's interest.  The storyline, which retains many similarities to \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" rarely drags, and includes plenty of action.  I enjoyed this film, and will watch it again.  Recommended.  RJB.
0066620996|4.0|One of the best books on management today.  The results of the research truly suggests that humility is one key attribute of successful leaders today.
B0018S6YOE|5.0|This CD represents the range that Rihanna has. And the range of appreciation for all types of pop music that I have.
0143038419|4.0|I read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" on a recent camping trip, when I had lots of time. I got the book out of my local library because I didn't want to pay for the musings of a narcissist (so many people here on Amazon trash Elizabeth Gilbert for self absorption). I mainly was interested in the India section, because I am an avid yoga/meditation practitioner, but I also had a long-ago very bad experience with Siddha Yoga (the author's guru is Gurumayi Chidvilasananda of Siddha Yoga, in my opinion a cult) so read out of curiousity.  I ended up reading the entire book, not just the India section. I am a world traveler myself, and relish good travel writing and a good journey. Lots of reviewers here trash the author, saying she's a middle class white woman (umm, does that make her less of a human being?).  But I am fascinated by a person who throws off the shackles of conformity and dares to live a more authentic life.  Many male authors have written of such journeys, and have we called them self-absorbed?  Not usually.  So why is a woman who takes care of herself so harshly criticized?  Just a few musings; I enjoyed the book.
