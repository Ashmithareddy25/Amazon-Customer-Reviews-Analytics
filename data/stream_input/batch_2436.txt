B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed the formatting of this story - the flash backs.  The subject was interesting.  Although I would still consider it a love story, it was not full of sexual content.  It held my interest and I did not want to stop reading.
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|I am a huge Christina Fan, I own all of her albums, this one was good, but not great, it was fun, and had some stronger moments and also had some weak ones, some of the songs were really amazing 'Amry of Me\\",\\"Sing for Me\\", \\"Blank Page\\" \\"Just a Fool\\", \\"Lotus Intro\\", 'Empty Words\\", some were really fun \\"not great\\" but fun \\"Let There Be Love\\", \\"Make The World Move\\" \\"Around the World\\" and \\"Your Body\\"  but some weren't even listenable \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\" and \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\" and \\"Cease Fire\\" and some were just okay and could have been great if not trying to shock to much or being autotuned in the lyrics \\"Circles', \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"Best Of Me\\" overall the CD is good for what it is, but it's not the best album she has done, I honestly loved her last album and everything before it, this one was just a nice listen but not something I would listen to alot expect for the songs I placed under great and good, the just okay ones, maybe but that's my opinion
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I think it is grate. Everything you could expect and a whole lot more about Iron Man. It's so good my whole family loves it and there's seven in my family!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted but had great surprises with the great characters created by the author! I will definitely lookup more of her books!!
B00AYB20KI|5.0|A must see Jennifer Lawrence is such a wonderful actress!<br />It was a love story mixed with some  suspense. What a Thriller
B004LUS390|1.0|This app usually works great. I like it, lots of layers, like any other program I would use to draw. So just a while ago I was working on this drawing of Harley Quinn from Batman and saved the outline and started coloring... when i was nearly done an hour or two later a notice came up saying the app was not responding... my choices were to force close or wait... after choosing wait only for the notice to come up shortly after I was forced to force close the app and lost all my work progress... I am usually quite fond of this app but I'm sure every artist understands my frustration with this problem and therefore I felt it needed to be reported...
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We all love this movie still,,,,and my kids are 17 and 15! It's a Disney movie, how can you go wrong
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing the graphics are wonderful the concept is really fun because it is challenging and its just fun to play when you have nothing else to do I recommend you get the app and best of all its FREE.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful and page tuning story of hope, human struggle, friendship and humor all rolled into one. You won't be able to put it down.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Read it before you see the so called movie that is based on the book. Would recommend for any Zombie fan.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Graphics are excellent and most clues are not always easy to find. A bit shorter than I expected, otherwise, very engaging. Thanks
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was glad the movie cut back on the violence that was in the book.  Definitely worth watching.  I watched it on my Kindle at the airport.
B003XVYLDU|1.0|I actually enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was enlightning. I couldn't believe how horrific the event was. After I read the book, I researched Dresden and what happened to the city. I couldn't believe that the facts were so different from what was accounted in the novel. In fact, at first I told myself, well maybe he didn't have the true facts before he wrote the book. That wasn't so. The true facts of Dresden were released in the 1950's. The book was published in 1969. So, read it as a fairy tale. Or maybe as a Hollywood \\"inspired from a true story.\\"<br />The casualty reports are highly inaccurate, and the fact that Dresden was indeed used for German military production was innacurately represented in the book. I would encourage anyone that reads this book to also research their facts. After I found the truth I discovered a book that was more anti-american propaganda than anything else.
B008Y73940|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It kept me entertainment on my 3-hour shuttle ride to the airport.  I would recommend it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone. Extremely addictive for a free app. Love playing it and do not regret picking it up!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Avatar is an astonishing achievement in film making unlike anything ever created before. James Cameron and the hundreds of creators who worked on this film managed to accomplish what seems impossible with Avatar. Its legend by now that this is the most expensive movie ever filmed. It also took more than 10 years to make. The film is an absolute jewel of creativity and glorifious visuals that go beyond any movie in history. George Lucas and Peter Jackson with their mammoth creations have never done anything this incredible. The massive scope of this production seems unbelievable to comprehend. This is a monumental masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed. How it didnt sweep the academay awards is mind boggling to me. This is simply one of the greatest movies ever created. If I could have given it 10 stars I would have. Simply astonishing movie making!! A solid production that escalates way beyond anything Cameron has ever done before. This is a must see film!!
B007CKNX28|5.0|Its a diverse album with lots of Jack White and back up singers harmony...pretty wild, but of course I like Jack Whites guitar playing and vocals.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Another masterwork for director Clint Eastwood. This might be his finest achievement in the directors chair to date. The entire film is briliantly directed. I think Eastwood took not only his biggest gamble ever with Invictus but he also created a very enjoyable and emotional story out of a point in history most of us in the United States knew little or nothing about. It seemed like an impossible task for Eastwood and Malpaso to make a great film about Mandelas new presidency while backdropping the story about how Mandela used rugby to bring his nation together in a new a brighter unity, and still do it effectivly and keep it insteresting. Here Eastwood pulled it off and managed to create a truly dramatic film that touches the heart and the soul. Its a wonderful and inspirational story. Morgan Freeman was astounding as Mandela. He should have earned the oscar for his perfectly rendered portrtrait of Mandela. His work is breathtaking and beautiful here. Before I saw this film I had no interest in sports or considered the idea that a sport could have such an effect on an entire nation. After I saw this film I gained a new admiration for such subjects. Eastwood has done an incredible job with this film. It didnt win the oscars that Unforgiven did, but in some ways it deserved to. This was indeed a much more mammoth undertaking than any film Eastwood has ever directed, and for a director at his age it really is astonishing how good a film he was able to make here. Im impressed.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Just what I wanted. I looks lovely and is still functional. And I have been to some of the cities. Even the feel of the cover is a joy to touch. Glad I bought this.Thank you.
B003EYVXYQ|2.0|I expected to absolutely hate this due to so many severely negative reviews, but I actually sort of enjoyed it. I thought it was better than the last two Romero movies, but then that is not saying much at all because I thought both of those films were terrible, especially Diary of the Dead, which I think is the worst film Romero ever made. Im not going to pretend this wasnt a bad movie, it wasnt really all that great, but it also was not that horribly bad. I kept trying to think of this movie as if it had been released in the mid 70s. If it had been I think people would have liked it a lot more. The humor in this movie was one thing people really seemed to despise, but it actually wasnt as hokey as some of the funny moments Romero had put in Dawn of the Dead, still a good deal of the humor was still pretty cheesy here. But there were some effective moments here and there and an underlying mood of mildly grim style to this I actually sort of liked. I really expected this movie to be so bad I would turn it off within a half hour, but it kept my interest for the most part. As far as Zombie films go this one ranks pretty low in my book, but its also better than others I have seen. There are a lot of bad Zombie films out there and this one while obviously pretty weak is not as bad and many I have seen. But no its not even close to as good as Romeros first three zombie films, but still worth seeing if your a die hard Romero fan, just to see what ideas he came up with this time. I agree though that hes lost his talent for making a really good zombie film, which really is pretty sad.
B007ZCQJOM|4.0|Great album, kinda 60s trippy groove to it, nice to zone out and drive to.  &#34;Myth&#34; and &#34;The Hours&#34; are the singles and I hope to hear more from Beach House.
B00AEFXI8W|4.0|Seems a lot of members here didnt care all that much for this film. Perhaps it is because they expected some kind of near masterpiece due to the fact that Ridley Scott directed it. After all this film came after Alien and Blade Runner, which are both timeless classics. Part of the problem is that this film feels very dated, but upon its release it got over all rave reviews from the critics. For its time it had a refreshing technically ahead of its time quality to it. It reminds me of Miami Vice in that during its time it seemed very cutting edge but now also feels cheesy and terribly dated. But for its time this movie was a solidly crafted detective thriller that was a real cut above the rest. One member commented in their review that this was one of Michael Douglass lesser known films. Well that is really not very true, because during its run in theaters it did very well and was one of the highest grossing films for its year. The story taking NY city cops out of their familiar turf and into the strange land of Japan hadnt really been done before to any memorable standard, but this film in its time was a real treat. Douglas and Garcia play thier characters to fit perfectly with this kind of subject mattter and Scott does a brilliant job with presenting the japanese aspect beautifully. The film has plenty of breathtaking action, great locations, vivid cinematography, and solid direction from Scott. I dont think this film represents Scotts best efforts but it is really a very memorable piece of film making that holds its own and is a decent police thriller.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Ever since I heard &#34;Little Lion Man&#34; off the last album on the radio, I've been dying for something new from these guys.  &#34;Babel&#34; is epic, every song is a hit, and the homoerotic overtones are just enough to engage the mind.  Nice country western mixed with traditional Irish or Scottish ballad tunes.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I love Carla Bruni's quiet, gentle guitar music and sweet little songs. If you want to remind yourself of a trip to Paris, or are dreaming of one in the future, get this CD and learn the words so you can sing along. It's great fun and may spark a new acquaintance if you start humming the songs when you visit the City of Light.
B00BDKFDDU|5.0|Hilarious! This book is great reading if you want tolaugh out loud. Read in one afternoon. Loved it! It will make you smile if you need an escape.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|fun just its all the same the suits are just plain awesome but gameloft add minigames or something like that<br />that would make my rate a 5 star rating
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You will get hookedLove the period dress and hairstyles, really beautiful. So watcher beware. Can't wait for the next season :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing! It is super fun, and very addicting. I got subway surfers and temple run 2 the same day, and this game wins hand  down. Always something new to work for each time you play.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The Shield is a direct no holds bared sight into the kind of Police work that could ware someone out or destroy them in the process.<br />\\"Good cop, bad cop\\" within the unit. Who is going to prevail, or survive.
B003SJ4VJ6|4.0|The movie starts a little slowly and really doesn't pick up pace until somewhere in the middle.  After the Ghost finds out certain things the movie picks up, and the ending is pretty neat.  It's a little ponderous, though, so be patient.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|I used to be a big Lil Wayne fan. Tha Carter was alright, I loved Tha Carter 2 and Tha Carter 3 was still half good. Since then Lil Wayne has not released a good song.If you listen to him rap it's so slow and that is not a good way to rap.  I didn't realize Lil Wayne had released a new album so I looked this up to see how bad it was. I laughed and I laughed and I'm still laughing. Not because of how good he raps but how bad he's become. If you love Lil Wayne listen to him rap not just the beat which is what mainstream artists aim for now. If you're confused as to what I mean look up Syllables by Eminem. That basically sums up my feelings. Lil Wayne can rap good-he just doesn't anymore. I'm not sure if it's because he thinks he's number one or what. If you want good rap listen to Jon Connor. If you love this album you don't know what good rap is.<br />If you're looking for good music stop looking here. Go buy an Eminem, Tupac, (old)Jay-Z, Big L, almost anything than what you hear on the radio.
B001LMAK88|4.0|This was Lawrence Kasdan's payback to Kevin Costner for being cut from The Big Chill.  It's a very light Western but somehow it entertains.  Anyone looking for authenticity ought to take a pass.  It's fun nevertheless.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|I choose the rating because I thought the movie was interesting. It is very taboo but also kinda hot, because the actors are, in a &#34;shhh i don't want anyone to know&#34; kinda way.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is probably THE most fun I've had with an app in a very long time! It is awesome!!!
B00BESLT6G|4.0|This movie picked up where the last one left off. I was not into it at first but as it went on I started to grasp it and it worked for me. Probably not at the top of my list but is worth the watch if you liked the first one.
B009R659L8|4.0|I read where others thought there were too many characters. but so does life.  It was a good read, how all these unconnected characters played a part in 2 deaths (actually 3).  I really thought I had it all figured out, but I did not expect the final plot twists.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I was very pleased with how fast I received the package and the quality. This was a gift and was worth it.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Laura is an amazing talent! She and her husband are classically trained artists. Her sound can resemble the great Nina Simone, yet she has a sound all her own, blending beautiful choral arrangements, harmonies & lyrics that she writes, arranges & composes.<br /><br />If your looking for a refreshing unique sound, as an alternative to much of the formulaic music of today, this is a must have album. Listen to my favorites, which are 'Diamonds', a song dedicated to her mother, 'Sing to the Moon', and 'Is There Anybody Out There?'<br /><br />Talented & Beautiful are just two obvious adjectives to describe her! So glad my wife is not a jealous woman, since she introduced me to her music videos on YouTube.
B0094MFITS|4.0|We are enjoying this. movie.  Can not  wait to see more Jesse Stone! Tom Sellick plays this part Extremely well!
0765365278|5.0|I'm a voracious reader of science fiction and fantasy. This is one of the best books I've read in many years. The setting is new, the plot is intriguing, and the characters grow. I can't wait to read the full saga.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Next to Harry Potter , this book is one of my favorites.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The actors and actresses are ones whom I have so enjoyed for many years. Totally fun to see them all in a film together and in the colorful beauty of India.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was misled by the use of the word 'original' in the title of the blu ray set.  I should have been looking for 'theatrical', and I've paid for my error.  If you are looking for the theatrical version of the real first trilogy, this is not it.  Save your time and money unless you enjoy the obviously edited versions that add Jabba into SW V (sorry George but I saw these all in the theatre and remember it well).
0143039881|4.0|\\"Eichmann in Jersualem\\" is Hannah Arendt's famous meditation on the trial of Adolf Eichmann, an SS officer who organized mass deportations of Jews to concentration camps during World War II.  The book was first published in The New Yorker in the mid-1960s, after Eichmann's trial.  It is an engrossing but very uneven book.  Profound insights are mixed with cheap shots at Israeli officials and the Jewish establishment; the writing is droll and eloquent, yet irritatingly disorganized.  Arendt was plainly a snob.  One wonders whether she did justice to the trial record.<br /><br />What lifts \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem\\" to the level of classic political literature is the portrait of Eichmann himself. In Arendt's rendering, he totally defies our expectations of what a Nazi killer should be like:  he's not a monster or a sadist; he's not even an anti-Semite.  Instead, he's an unemployed salesman who sees the Nazi movement as a career opportunity; he's a clueless functionary who prides himself on following orders and playing by the rules even while his bosses are plotting to cut deals with the Allies; he's a conformist who never sees that genocide is evil because no \\"respectable\\" person ever tells him that it is.  Arendt paints Eichmann as a stereotypical hollow man who does his job and lets other people do his thinking for him, even when the job is mass murder.<br /><br />It's hard to know whether the portrait is historically accurate, because Arendt had so many philosophical and cultural axes to grind.  But the picture does lodge in the reader's mind as a warning that the worst crimes are often committed by people who don't see themselves as criminals because society tells them they're good citizens.  The U.S. military establishment and intelligence bureaucracy are filled with Eichmanns:  just think of the ICBM officers, drone \\"pilots,\\" and CIA torturers who check career boxes, flatter their bosses, and look forward to promotions and good pensions.  All it takes is a Strangelove, Cheney, or Obama to unleash them.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It's a Ken Follett book.  What else is there to say.  Follett, as usual, is in top form.  Great character development, a compelling story, and a well-researched historical background.  A total page-turner.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Great book. It was so well written...the distinctions among the various dialects were very well done. It did make it challenging to read, though. I loved this book, really.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Long movie.  Standard Quentin Tarantino movie.  Pretty boring, fell asleep in the middle.  Wish I could get those 3 hours back.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|I was skeptical after reading the reviews. The great deal seemed worth the risk however. Totally worth it.All the dvds work great. Thank you.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun for the kids and it helps teach them about earning and spending.  It also is not fast and flashy causing flash back fits.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The CD was shipped with the standard 3-5 business days but arrived two days later!  This item is processed and shipped very quickly.  I recommend standard shipping since it arrived so soon without paying additional fees.<br /><br />The CD arrived in shrink wrap and upon opening contained no scratches or other imperfections.  The sound quality is amazing thanks to the remastering by the ABCKO company who owns the rights the Rolling Stones music from the 1960's to 1971.<br /><br />Normally, I would have bought this on iTunes as I have done with other Rolling Stones albums in the past but there is a certain appeal about having a hard copy of the CD with the artwork and inside cover.  The quality of which is great.<br /><br />Interesting note about the sound quality, for those of us who bought the original vinyl record in 1968 regarding the sound remastering about the music.  I noticed the songs seemed very clear and a little bit faster than the original vinyl.  The sound on this CD was the intended version for the vinyl record but an error slowed the music.  I highly recommend this product for those who would like to hear what the Rolling Stones intended in 1968 however it is quite fun to listen to the vinyl record of this album and compare the differences in sound.
B007N5YJYS|5.0|I've probably seen it 100 times and I still love it.  The clarity of picture and sound is to be applauded and so is the commentary.  Thanks to Criterion for having it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good book, interesting topic. Movie was fairly different and I had watched the movie first and then read it. Really easy to read, funny at times, and relatable.
B000LC55F2|5.0|this  one of  my  all time favorite movie so filled with  intrigue and enigmas and puzzles that are solved no more than  in front  of  a crowd that has their  expectations very high and are ready  to  be amused for they are all skeptics and ready  to  laugh at  any error that the magician my  have overlooked when writing out the prestige of their trick. definitely Recommend this one for your  collection.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|A truly heart-warming film which is also educational.  Jim Carrey is utterly likable and the story, though a bit of a stretch, is entertaining and riveting.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I believe this is a wonderful book. Everyone can learn something from this book. This book does get a little graphic when talking about how the animals died, and very detailed. If you can't handle topics like this, I suggest you find another book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game soo soo soo much!!!!!!!!! I love how it has the different places to run. I give it a ten.  :)
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My grandkids watched over and over again.  That makes me love it, because I can do other things while they are watching this movie - lol.  They are 7 and 4.<br /><br />Thank you !!!!
B0012PDVQ2|3.0|I was disappointed in this highly acclaimed sci-fi.<br />A few, very few good scenes, very poor screenplay and dialog.<br />Too dark, lots of water, and really no clues dropped at all, as to where its going.<br />Doesn't come close to 12 Monkeys, or The Matrix series.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|I have rented this more than once.  I have a granddaughter 7 and grandson 4, and they love this movie.  You would<br />think I would just go out and buy it, but it is much faster to just rent with a click - lol.<br /><br />When you are watching two kids each day, renting a movie they love is GREAT !!!!<br /><br />Thank you for having this available.  It is very nice for this old grandma - lol
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game was spoon amazing when I downloaded it to my kindle fire. But the 2nd day I tried to play it wouldn't. work at all. I recommend you don't get this app on your kindel bit on you iphone. This game worked perfect on my iphone.
1592332803|5.0|This is the best cookbook on vegan baking! I could never bake before I went vegan. Then I found this book and everything turns out so delicious! My husband loves the brownie recipes....definitely should be a staple in your kitchen! Highly recommend this to my friends and family....
B0029LXGXG|5.0|I've already had this album since it's release via Itunes a few years ago. But once I took the leap to vinyl it was one of my must owns. The great thing about the Vinyl is that it also contains a copy of the CD version too. So now I have it on all media types, which is great, you kind of need it on all media types since it's just that great of an album.
B00C1XZ2LQ|3.0|After falling in love with Daft Punk's soundtrack for Tron: Legacy which also had the same director as Oblivion, I thought lightning might strike twice. Unfortunately, much like the movie itself, this album never quite finds it footing. There are a lot of great elements but it doesn't seem like they ever come to a satisfying culmination. Overall, it's enjoyable and I have a few favorites like the closing track as well as StarWaves.
B00125JP1C|5.0|This was a great movie, I love Clive Owens character! He has some Great \\"moves\\"  the storyline was really good too! Just an all around must see movie! Loved it <3
0425252868|5.0|Congratulations to Adam Makos on a detailed, well structured biography that reads like a novel with the reality of life, especially the reality of combat (I'm a Marine vet from Iraq).  This story is a must for any military enthusiast.
1592332803|5.0|This book is an essential part of any vegan or non vegan library. It is unlike no other because it provides valuable trouble shooting tips and how tos.  I have never seen another cookbook author take the time to explain why cookies come out hard, why bread doesn't rise, etc.  These tips are almost as valuable as the recipes, which are easy to make and FABULOUS.  Being vegan is definitely not sacrificing taste if you use Colleen's cookbooks.
030758836X|5.0|Book #41 Read in 2013<br />Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn<br /><br />I do not think I have ever read a book that had as main characters such unlikable people as this book did; Nick and Amy are nasty.  That being said, this book was like a train wreck and I could not look away; I had to keep reading to find out what happened.  On their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy goes missing.  Shortly thereafter, the police and the media are looking at Nick as the person who made Amy disappear.  He had cheated on her, emotionally withdrawn from her and, according to Amy's found diary, physically abused her at times.  But did Nick really kill her?<br /><br />This book had tons of twists and turns to keep readers engaged.  I was rooting for both Nick and Amy to get their just desserts.  This was a good mystery and I recommend it.  It seems to be one of those books that people either love or hate; I was more on the love side.<br /><br />[...]
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A captivating story with remarkable characters. I devoured this book like a hungry man eating a Snickers bar. Yes, I am ready for the sequel.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Before reading this book, I read a review that this book was like one of those stories where one person starts it and then others pick up where the last person left off and so on.  I couldn't agree more i thought it was strange, fun, and fantastic!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Such a devoted staff and family they served was spellbinding as well as very educational for me, a middleclass mother.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's kinda like a subway surfer style of game, a whole lot better! The graphics are sweet! And one of the coolest parts is unlocking the Iron Man armours. Definitely one of the best free games for kindle. Enjoy, I know I did.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I bought this series having never seen one episode just on its reputation.  I am very glad I did.  It tells a story of the 2011 war on terror, which is much different, but related to the 2001 war.  The story centers around two definitely \\"broken\\" people.  One a Marine who is rescued after being held captive by terrorists for 8 years, and the other a CIA analyst who is convinced that he has been turned and is now working for those same terrorists.<br /><br />The story has a lot of twists and turns, and at least for the first half the the season it takes you on a is he or isn't he ride.  You do find the answer before the end of the season, but there is still a lot of suspense in the final few episodes and the season ends on a cliff hanger. I will not go into any more detail than that, so as not to spoil those who have not seen it yet.  I think many shows where there is such a focus on a central mystery like that (see Twin Peaks) really fizzle once you know the answer.  At least in this season that did not happen.  I have not seen the second season yet, so I am not sure if that is still the case.<br /><br />The best part of the series is the great ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis and Claire Danes are definitely the focus of the series, but everyone from Mandy Patinkin, Morena Baccarin, to David Harewood do a great job in their roles.  Fans of the series Due South will also recognize David Marciano, who is an ex CIA officer that helps Danes' character run surveillance.  The show is very fast paced, and packs a lot into the 12 episodes.  I think this works a lot better as a cable series with a shorter season than it would be on broadcast TV where they would have to stretch everything out into 22+ episodes.<br /><br />The extras on the Blu Ray version consists of commentary on some of the episodes, deleted scenes, a \\"making of\\" feature with the writers and show runners, then some character features.  Nothing too extensive, but worth watching if you actually purchase the disks.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had waited for this DVD for so long, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was received in excellent condition  Now awaiting eagerly the 4th season.  Amazon makes all my purchases easy and convenient.  .
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I really like this movie.  It reminds me alot of another favorite movie, &#34;The Accidental Tourist&#34;.  Both movies are about guys with mental issues, that have a quirky family, who are trying to put their lives together.  Both are separated from their wives and have a wacky new woman in their life, whether they like it or not.  If you like &#34;The accidental Tourist&#34;  you will likely enjoy &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34;, a very funny film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This subway surfers is amazing and is really addictive its a good game to play when your bored worth downloading
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I'm a dyed in the wool, bonafide Jane Austen fan and don't typically enjoy contemporary spins on the classics. BUT THIS MOVIE is as genuine to the Austen spirit (as can be expected if a woman from the 21st Century were truly portaged back in time) and found herself amidst the more genteel customs and lack of modern convenience.<br /><br />Jemima Rooper plays it believably and all I can say is I hope the writers, producers & players are willing to go the distance and bring all the other titles to life! Alex Kingston does a marvelous portrayal of Mrs Bennet and the writers give an insight and depth to her dire position of mother to five girls that allows for her overwhelming emotionalism. Don't get me wrong, she's a basket-case but we've all known a few of those and obviously so did Miss Austen! Hugh Bonneville's character, Mr Bennet, is even more delightful and witty but the biggest surprise in madcap is Wickham! Here we find a plausible extension to his fiber (both moral and/or otherwise) that rounds out his personality. I found it hard to believe that a young man so evil could have gained the trust of old Mr Darcy (being that readers are led to believe that he is so discerning) and wise a judge of character.<br /><br />Contemporary viewers may think of Regecy life as a slower pace but Jane Austen moves plots along like a freight train and this movie keeps up the pace. All in all- a delightful romp that I love to surprise and share with my friends who need a good diversion from our reality and technology.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I bought the kindle version of the esv study bible to read on my galaxy tab 2 after trying the sample. I loved the esv links to footnotes, introductions, and study outline as how they worked in the sample chapter (genesis) And $9.90 is a great price!<br /><br />Unfortunately the full book doesnt work as well as the sample using the kindle software. Turning a page sometimes works, sometimes doesnt. Clicking on a link hangs the application and returns a \\"wait or close\\" error message. It seems to work better on my kindle fire, but I prefer using the galaxy for its 10 inch screen.<br /><br />Update: reinstalled \\"factory version\\" of kindle software on the galaxy and now it works like it should. I am able to flip through pages, use the links, etc. Bumping the rating from 3 to 5 stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids love how realistic the horses can be.  How they move around and nibble the grass as they are waiting for you to do something and things like that.  Great game!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Very well written, but I found it boring. Skimmed the last quarter of the book, and ended up not finishing it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very deep book. Couldn't put it down. The story line was amazing. As always with a Nicholas sparks book.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I love this season, but 10 will have a place in my heart. The quality is great and had no problem downloading.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I'm somewhat informed about permissions. I am careful about what I download and also careful about what I use my phone for (I save banking and credit card use for the computer). Also I leave GPS off until I need it. Apps are probably doing all sorts of things we don't know about. But I read the bad reviews for this game and I'm not sure what nefarious intentions this game has. They can tell what you use your phone for. So? And how can they use that for advertising if the game has NO ads? And there are a lot of good reviews on google play that don't sound fake.<br /><br />That said, a review of the game. I actually thought about purchasing it before but I'm not a big fan of arcade games. I like levels to feel like I'm accomplishing something, and I get bored easily. But this game is fun!! It has become one of my favorites. The graphics are adorable, and game play is simple and easy. Cute sneezy sounds too. I'm about halfway through the achievements and I've made it 2/3 to earth. I don't get tired of playing it, I actually have to be careful when I open it because it's hard to stop playing. :) I figured after a while the achievements would be impossible, but they aren't yet. I find the rate at which I'm able to buy items to help with the achievements is perfectly balanced with the rate that I earn stars. I don't have to play the game over and over just to earn stars to buy things. I love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I Have been enjoying each episode of season i and 2.  Looking forward to season 3.  Hope there is a season 4.
B0041KW53U|1.0|The picture on this 3d has a red ghost on every thing. In other words for instance the when the child moves a red out line of him (and every thing else in the shot) has a red out linecoming off of him that moves with him. I have a 3d TV  and even tryed my own glasses but that did no good. There are 4 pairs of cardboard 3d glasses with the movie but the picture with them was even worse. I love the movie and was really disappointed. Save your money. Don't even bother trying it.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I think that everyone will enjoy this movie. A little History, good music, love, hard ship and friends, what more could you want? Don't make the mistake that I did and loan it out, you might not get it back, I had to order another one.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|A nice game to pass time and keep you entertained. very easy going and you can pick it up and play whenever you want.
076421120X|5.0|I received this book from Bethany House to read and review.<br />This is a wonderful, inspirational devotional book that divides each month up to focus on a different aspect of Jesus' character. Each day has a verse, a reading and finishes with a short prayer. They don't take but 5 minutes to read for those who don't have much time, but they are deep thoughts that leave you feeling full and satisfied. I love that the daily scriptures come from different versions, whichever one will help reflect the thought best.  Darlene's writings are real, pertain to us today and cause you to love the Savior more deeply.<br />January- Faithful<br />February- Solid Rock<br />March- Shield<br />April- Holy One<br />May- The Gate<br />June- Savior<br />July- Risen One<br />August- Redeemer<br />September- Breath of Life<br />October- Peace<br />November- Friend of Sinner<br />December- Messiah
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This was a gift to my daughter with her Kindle Fire and she liked it as a whole present and have not heard anything since.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|Blue Ray stopped playing in the middle of the movie. Couldn't get back to the scene and watch it, Blue Ray always skipped. Returned item.
031603441X|5.0|The true words of a rock and roll legend who has lived the life to the fullest, survived the hard times and continues now to enjoy the best of times as a good man, husband, father and grandfather. Long live the true king of rock and roll!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This year has been mysterious and extremely intense.  The stalker, though there has been no sign of him for a few episodes, it's still gets to you, cause you're afraid someone else is going to leave.  Please, we need the family to stay together.  They work so well together.  There isn't a character or and actor/actress I don't like.  They work so well together.  I look forward to each new episode, because they always keep you on the edge of your seat.
0312430000|4.0|It kinda spends a lot of time talking about other checklist systems and how they can be used in the medical field. I would recommend reading it, but do expect a lot of non-medical talk.
B00933JL0A|5.0|been trying many kinds of building games and this one is one of my favorite. I like the real graphics,  the logic of game. the update makes this game much more better. good job of whom created this.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to get into these books.  No there is stopping! Very well-written, good characters.  Bawdy, delicious, violent, macabre, valiant, exciting, comedic and awesome.  Yes, it IS worth all the hype.  Can't wait to read the rest!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It stops every few seconds to ask you to rate it or invite people, I'd just like some time to play the game first.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The first book was an introduction, the second book was the required &#34;bridge,&#34; and this third book does all the necessary dirty work to continue the story line.  People love it because stuff happens.  And yes, it is very exciting when we see some of our favorite characters (or least favorite) getting their ultimate time in the spotlight.  The book does not pull punches, however, and the plot continues to flow even when one surprise happens after another.  It feel like a reward for reading books 1 and 2, and also excites me because it makes me wonder what he is building up to for book 6 or 7.  Great book, but make sure you read the first two so that you can also bask in the satisfaction of all the crazy twists and turns.
B0063M22QO|2.0|this is a terrible game no challenges, noneed to think cause it is sooooo easy. no i would not recommend this game to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This novel is a transitional bridge, and I get that.  It means Book 3 will be amazing.  All book series have it, so I have no complaint with all the explanations and drawn-out passages.  By paying attention, I have become even more sucked into the world of GoT.  New characters, new story lines, all very exciting.  Recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I stayed up all night to read it because I couldn't put it down. Great book! I haven't seen the movie but in the book she's a brunette so I'm kinda bummed they made her blond for the movie.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Flynn's characters are so well written they are scary.  They are intense and vulnerable at the same time.  Not her best, but not her worst, and quite readable.  I recommend it.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This album is everything I expected and more. I've Been a Paramore fan for a long time and they never disappoint!!
B008TRUDAS|1.0|How many times did I want to throw this book in the trash? Terrible characters, clich&eacute;, and sometimes downright laughable.  The only reason I finished it was to see if it could possible get any worse.  It did not disappoint.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of predictable, easy, cheesy and untalented romance novels, this is the one for you.  Kind of like &#34;Twilight,&#34; without all the supernatural crap, and with a weird and frankly uncomfortable &#34;student-teacher&#34; romance thread.  Yuck.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great for watching with the family. Everyone will laugh.<br />It doesn't matter if you are a kid or an adult, you will enjoy this movie.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|So this was her first try, not bad.  Maybe if I'd read it first, but I read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; first, and it was incredible.  Still, not bad.  I would read it again.  I can see where her plot writing was developing and where she is honing that sharp knack for character development.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would highly recommend this book! I couldn't put it down! A must read for anyone who likes fiction books!
B000I9X54Q|3.0|The first two Underworld movies were really good but this one disappointed me.  It just didn't seem to be made in the same way the other two were.
B0033AGPEE|5.0|5 stars because it is a real Hendrix  product,<br />great quality vinyl, noiseless playback ...<br />some reviews not as good as this ...  Jimi was an artist, different everyday,<br />great to hear what he had to play another way on another day...
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|You can't play this game without connecting it to your Facebook account. While the gameplay seems interesting (jundging from the tutorial) with new powerup mechanics, the madatory Facebook integration is a dealbreaker for me.
B00AA0U046|5.0|Those that don't rate this as high may have never had<br />chance to witness some of the best artists of that period...<br />Jimi, among others, was a great artistic HUMAN being,<br />so glad to hear his different versions of himself !!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Intuitive, but without giving answers.  Stable software.  Easy settings.  Nice job on this one!  Definitely a five star rating.  I'm a fan.
B009MO5E10|5.0|If you ride bikes through cities then you might appreciate the work that they put into showing you how one thinks as you dart and dodge among cars, pedestrians, and other hazards!<br /><br />The story, itself, is reveals itself in an interesting way which we found appealing to discect. Enjoyable film.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I thought this movie was better than I expected. I really wasn't expecting much. The little twist at the end was nice.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi Hendrix's music is always grand, and this album is superb. It still breaks my heart that he died so young, he was amazingly talented as this album reconfirms.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This is an awful!  Not funny, sad. Parents acting like this around their children when the turn 40 is not funny!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I first played this game on my computer,and am very happy to have it on my Kindle. I like the fact that it is challenging & fast paced.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|There were flashes of Tarantino, but the acting was great. Waltz plays a very interesting character. Foxx was great as always.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Very entertaining. Its a great single/widowed mother raises great kid story. I really enjoyed it. First love/lost love validated. Its a feel good funny movie.
B0002E5O9G|4.0|However, when it was transferred from the VHS version (the original recording method), most of the &#34;screen shots&#34; of the actual Broadway performance were omitted. Hence, the storyline is much more difficult to follow and it lacks the added depth of action that the screens provide.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Best cd they have released so far! I have all their other cds an yes this new one is amazing!
055338466X|1.0|It was purchased as a text for a college class. The content was presented in an arrogant and condescending manner.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Can't wait for the movie.  Ants. That's what the zombies reminded of ....Ants.  Just a great read and held my attention from page to page.
1594744475|5.0|Very easy explanations and excellent photos to show the finished products. Creative and very engaging - encouraging to try them all!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Recommend it to everyone. It is a feel good movie, Gave it as a gift and they enjoyed It also.
B005M5PENG|2.0|More buzz than anything very superficial... no real depth to charachters.... plot line is weak... would not be one of the shows that I follow.  I think they are hoping that the load noise will be enough to keep people awake and thinking that something is actually happening on the sreen.
B009AMAK54|5.0|Great movie. Clint Eastwood never lets you down.  Enjoyed it very much. Would recommend it to anyone who is a baseball fan and a Clint Eastwood fan.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show.  The jokes are waaaaaaay overdone and redundant, but the chemistry is still terrific.  It has run its course, I can't wait to finally meet Ted's future wife already!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is my favorite game ever<br />I play it all the time everybody should get this game now I don't have to get a real horse this game is great!!
B009AP2G26|4.0|I love the development of the graduated characters while showcasing the new cast.  I admit some of the magic is gone, I can't quite put my finger on why.  I feel that the new recordings are overproduced and too auto-tuned.  Still I enjoy the show. I miss Will Schuester singing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game its cool really cool its great and fun i think lots of people should get this game
B000O14VAU|5.0|It's a great movie filled with action and suspense. It would probably scare a small child though. It is filled with vampires and lichens.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the games ever in my opinion because their is no limit and in survival me and my friends also love it mowing in my opinion is the best producer so if your looking for a great game to play
B008J34466|5.0|The cd was brand new in the wrapper and Perfect. The only this is it took a little while to get here.... Like 2 weeks.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Well first let me say, I am bias, I come from Philly and love all their teams and Robert De Niro will always be my favorite actor so I will like it just because of that. That being said all the actors in it are good but Jennifer Lawrence steals the show, it blew my mind to find out she was only 21 years old when they filmed it and Cooper was 37. I liked all their performances but the movie comes alive as soon as Lawrence walks in the room when their characters meet for the first time. \\"Tiffany\\" is just a girl you have to like at least I do cause I am on the crazy side so I like crazy women and she is smart and the type of girl that will put anyone in their place if they need it. I am glad I bought it On demand, I watched it four times already, its a movie you can watch over and over and learn something different every time. Low budget big payoff, cute story and great performance by an actor I have never seen before (Jennifer Lawrence) well done all.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Worth every penny (I bought the full game).  Has everything to make an incredible game experience. I obviously recommend this game.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's been hard for me to get into a good book lately - but this one grabbed me and it wasn't hard to stay involved.  It's been a long time since I've looked forward to coming home from work just so I can read the book...very enjoyable and ill be reading the rest of the series.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|Gads, what to say? It's not a classic, but as an Indiana Jones movie it's good. I don't think this one got as much attention as some of the others though it is their equal or better in some respects.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I missed the gadgets but the acting and story was good. I wish I had just rented it instead. Worth one viewing.
B0091REZMW|3.0|keys take to long to get been in kitchen and bedroom forever. graphics could be better and there should be sound.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone. My husband has not read the books and said the movie was great. I have read the books and I think the movie is geared toward the reader. If you want the most out of it, read first!
B00377V6J2|5.0|If you are a Stevie Ray fan, this is for you. A treat to be able to see these two greats.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game of all time.no one should dislike this game it's the best.if you do dislike this song talk to me and get a life.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|First time user! Had a lot of fun with it! Need some more practice with it!! Like eating the swimmers ;)
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Started as a movie where I was hmm I don't get it and then got really good fast.  lots of twists and turns and enough action to keep you interested.
1416583432|1.0|If you are not at all familiar with dogs then this is the book for you.  If you have been around them and read much about then, then there might not be much new information here for you.  I found the first couple of chapters quite boring because of the lack of new information.  Perhaps there is something new in the later chapters?  I also found that many facts are stated without reference to specific studies to back up them up, so it does not seem to be a scholarly work.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's novels, and I think this one is the best.  The characters are fully developed, the historical scenes are interesting, and the ending is a keeper.  Loved it.
B00136NUG6|5.0|If you like Earth, Wind, and Fire, you'll love their greatest hits album. Perfect gift for Earth, Wind, and Fire fans too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This  is awesome it is so much fun you should get It.<br />you get to by New thing's like people and hover board's.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Highly entertaining action-packed movie. Wish I would have seen this in the theater. Will never think of Abe the same again. Clever, exciting, well done.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This is a story about redemption, and it's one of a few that I watch repeatedly.  It succeeds on all fronts.  The cinematography is amazing, the acting is believable and captivating by both DeNiro and Irons, and the music touches your soul.<br />It's been out of my library for a few years, so I'm excited that it's on the way.
0060555661|5.0|This should be in everyone's library. Chapter reviews are phenomenal and give great research and insight for anyone who may consider investing. #1 read.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game has beautiful graphics, the h/o is challenging but not overly, and it's combined with a good mix of puzzles. Hint button available. Can't beat 'free' on this.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Mystery and unique puzzles make this game a fun and thought provoking title that is worthy of expanding further upon.
B00004SAAY|3.0|I love Bach, but whoever the sound engineer was missed it.  Everything is great but---- the harpsichord is so soft in comparison to the other instruments that you can hardly hear it most of the time.  And since these are harpsichord concertos---major problem.<br /><br />Other than that, the music was well performed. A great deal for the money.<br /><br />Hope the sound will be adjusted for future buyers.<br /><br />Pat
B000FA5SMK|5.0|John keeps you guessing.  And just when you think he finds love...  Hate to sound cliched but &#34;what a roller coaster&#34;!
B008H5J510|5.0|Her care for her fans, her craftsmanship on the stage, her quality of music, her great performances. this is captured and more. She is a strong family person despite her rebellion from the religious radicalism her grew up with. She is a humanitarian. Most impressive in the whole set is her openness about the breakup of her marriage and the courageous way she handled it while on tour. I am a baby boomer, a classic rock fan AND a big fan of the very talented Katy Perry.
B00979JTWK|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to be a spectacular series in every way.  There are many twists and turns but the viewer is kept enthralled throughout

0316044695|5.0|This book helps us &#34;at home&#34; American citizen understand the sacrifices  our overseas troops make in order to preserve our freedoms. Lone Survivor is a gripping true life story of the individuals in uniform who are asked to perform extraordinary feats on a daily basis with little or no recognition. Every American should read this book as well as Chris Kyle's &#34;American Sniper&#34; to help us understand the enemy we will be fighting for many years. Liberty is not cheap and the sacrifices these American soldiers are making should be understood. These soldiers should never be forgotten...
1878424319|5.0|best  book i ever read its very short, very simple but very meaningful. i recommend this book to everyone i know and we have used it for book group
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|I cannot believe I thought this would be a good movie.  With the actors and the rating it got, I expected way more.  This movie has no class and how anyone could find it even remotely entertaining is amazing.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|If you like concerts this is a MUST HAVE. It wows you since the very first song. There are very few blu rays that can compare. David FOSTER is truly a midas and the variety of artists won't dissapoint you.WOW you'll want to see it over and over again. I LOVE CONCERTS Blurays and this is one my fav.
B0095P29EG|4.0|I liked Thor very much BUT it seemed to be missing something, other wise i would have given it 5 stars.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This third book of the trilogy nicely finished up the story but by the time I had finished I was thoroughly sick of the graphic sex. Some things are better left to one's imagination!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I do not rate games, this one is fun, but that is all I will say. Try it out, it was free
B006H5120E|3.0|the bundle is a great idea 5 stars for that.<br />the movie is great 5 stars for that.<br /><br />the fact that the digital copy is impossible to download is very irritating.....1 star for that.
0345803485|5.0|Book is amazing, it draws you in from page one! Good beginning book for those just getting into romantic and bdsm reads
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great addictive game. It's great to earn more prizes.I love to play tournaments. I love to be told I'm great and this game does all the time.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long time. One of those movies I would actually watch more than once.  Laughed and cried
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I am so glad I read the book before I watched the movie!! The book is wonderful and I enjoyed it a lot so I was anxious to see the movie. What a disappointment!!! It's almost like a totally different story. I have a feeling Matthew Quick was very upset when he saw what Hollywood had done to his awesome story!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book held my interest all the way through. I enjoyed the Irish v3rnacular as well.  I highly recommend this book.<br />P
B00BEYYEE4|2.0|The only reason I purchased this movie is because I am a fan of Russell's.<br />He gets second billing behind Wahlberg's.  Oscar winner behind non award winner.  Catherine, who I like, another Oscar winner did NOT have her name above title.  But Wahlberg with no award wins?  I do not care if he produced, show correct credit in films.<br /><br />I will say this plus to the blu ray/DVD combo.  At least the blu ray had some extras.  I was not expecting that since the film was not successful at the box office or with critics.<br /><br />You could not follow the story.  Yes, surprises BUT they have to make sense.<br /><br />Did we really need to follow Wahlberg's personal life with the girlfriend/wife, whoever she was.  Made no sense and was unnecessary.<br /><br />I found myself fast forwarding over the scenes without Russell and or Catherine.  I just did not care.<br /><br />They did do a good job with their roles, not surprising.<br /><br />Unless you are a fan of the cast just bypass this film.  Makes no sense.
1451695195|1.0|WOW. It takes nerve to go public and claim you have PROOF of heaven, just because you were in a coma.<br /><br />OK, so he's a doctor and a scientist, and supposedly a skeptic (who nevertheless goes to church twice a year). And he knows how the brain works, so of course his NDE was more real than others'.<br /><br />While I love to read about NDEs and the hope they provide, I think this book is a clever spoof on a gullible public that is starving for proof -- and like me, hoped that a supposedly brilliant neurologist would provide it.  Surely a scientist who knows the ways of neurons can be trusted to detach himself from the emotional throes of those who seek hope, right?<br /><br />Truth is, even if everything he suggests is true, it still isn't proof for the rest of us.  Just for him. (If that.)<br /><br />So go ahead, feed the bestseller list and his bank account by buying the book.  But don't buy the \\"proof\\" without thinking for yourself, OK?<br /><br />Bottom line:  Another nice NDE story to give us hope. But no PROOF.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I never leave my house without checking this app first. I ride my bike to work and like to know if I'm going to need extra gear to avoid getting wet. This app is great for the forecast of the day the rest of the week fluctuates a lot so I only check it for the day.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I enjoyed this disk--very good songs, wonderful vocals.  I have been listening all month, thinking about how good these songs are.
B007REV4YI|4.0|After 50 years of James Bond could there be any new surprises?  Skyfall provides a few.<br /><br />In many ways Skyfall is about heritage.  James Bond comes full circle as glimpses of his childhood are revealed.<br /><br />His relationship with M is explored aptly.  The connection between them is delicately demonstrated.<br /><br />Of course you have the super intelligent baddie, Raoul Silva. This time he has a personal grudge to settle with M.<br /><br />MI6, the British fortress of invincibility, suffers under his skillful hand.  Using Winston Churchill's WWII bunker as the new headquarters was a nice touch.<br /><br />Of course you have exotic locales, beautiful women and music to set the tone of Skyfall.  All of these elements are part of the film series.<br /><br />To many adding Q, the Quartermaster, as a young techie, was a delight.  Of course Moneypenny finally shows up in the Daniel Craig's James Bond's world.<br /><br />The ending is emotional gripping.  James Bond and M face the ultimate challenge with tragic results. Skyfall is the childhood home of Bond where the ultimate, final battle takes place between the present and the past.<br /><br />The old chapel on the estate is a fitting memorial as M comes face to face with her past and \\"sins\\", and Bond finally leaves his past, Skyfall, in ruins.  He closes the chapter on his childhood and the tragic loss of his parents and now M, who was like a mother.<br /><br />This film, in many ways, reverberates back to the original concepts of the James Bond series.  The fate of M portrayed brilliantly by Judi Dench (1995-2012) is the saddest moment in this fine presentation, but all good things must come to an end.<br /><br />The world today is much different from 1962 when Dr. No. first appeared on movie screens.  Commenting on the world today in Skyfall, M said,<br /><br />\\"I'm frightened because our enemies are no longer known to us. They do not exist on a map. They're not nations, they're individuals. And look around you. Who do you fear? Can you see a face, a uniform, a flag? No! Our world is not more transparent now, it's more opaque! It's in the shadows. That's where we must do battle.\\"<br /><br />Recent events testify that in the shadows individuals wait to bring fear and harm to the innocents.  Her words may be fictional, but they aptly describe our reality in 2013.

B00BGIBVRG|1.0|This movie was not funny or romantic...or good in anyway.  Very predictable....just wanted it to end.  Save our money and TIME!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very good game with strategies and cool traveling places like tokyo I wish they would put France and Germany
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a lot of fun with great graphics and challenges.  I'm not big on these kind of games but this one is really good.  Would definitely recommend it to others.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The book was presented in a &#34;easy to relate to my life experiences&#34; manner. It gave many useful concepts that I can use to improve my personal growth in business and everyday life. I was impressed with the success of several examples, IE. Paul O'Neil and the many major changes he orchestrated in the companies he led along his career path. I purchased the audio book last year, but already am enjoying the fruit of habit changes. I am starting to recognize the folly of ignoring or not looking for reasons some choices are destined to be less than satisfactory. I also can look back in my life and see why some endeavors failed, and some succeeded, all relating to habit. I originally listened to the book, but I was so impressed with the presentation that I  purchased the printed version so I can use the pdf to look for info.
B00380URIO|4.0|Realistic portrayal of science fiction, space travel and the decision making process of the corporate world. Rockwell was impressive in his lead role.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I have two grandchildren ages 2 and 5. Both are completely taken with this movie. I enjoy watching it as well. What a great family movie.
B00A81NFAS|3.0|The movie is fabulous, of course.  However I am disappointed with the digital copy. I was able to redeem my UV copy but I can't get the iTunes copy to work. When went to the website listed on the insert I get a \\"File 404 not found\\" message.  I finally tried \\"[...]\\" instead of the \\"www\\" on the instructions and that worked.  Just in case  anyone else is having issues.  The insert is misleading...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is great. It's amazing how the true enemy isn't the walkers. And please remember anyone can die at any time. Great special effects.  Food job a and e

0307476073|5.0|Bought it for a gift and she loved it she could not put it down. read it in 2 days
B005H29GSI|2.0|My 5 1/2 year old son picked this game out for himself. I love the idea of playing the game &#34;for real&#34; instead of on the iPhone but this one just didn't work out well for us. My kids got really frustrated because it was really hard for them to stack the pieces, which are very light plastic. Also, the dynamite box fell apart immediately. I really like the concept, but the materials were just too cheap.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This is a must have cd for anyone who enjoyss the BeeGee's music. It even has their newer releases from the late 90's on it.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|You always hope to get Pulp Fiction when watching a subsequent Tarantino movie, but you always end up strangely dissatisfied. Django Unchained (\\"the 'D' is silent\\") is a plodding homage to the spaghetti westerns of yore that doesn't really get cooking until an hour in. There we go through the rabbit hole into a fantasy freakshow of toothless varmints, idyllic plantations, a coolly delicious villain, and, the best part, an unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson as an impish Uncle Tom, who plays the same character in every movie, whether he's a superspy or a Jedi Knight, but his trash-talking street persona works here to great a effect.  The shootout(s) at the end are worth the wait, although it would have been more satisfying to just have one...but Tarantino just had to one-up Margaret Mitchell with a few sticks of dynamite.  One strange thing...it's still a white man who unchains Django, and in the end, it's a sell-out who ends up the real villain.  It's almost like Tarantino, for all his outward negrophilia, still believes in the white man's burden.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is not my usual read; however, I have not been able to put either the Hunger Games or Catching Fire down until I've finished.  Very different for me and a wonderful change.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free, connect-the-dots fun...a great way to exercise your brain cells while waiting for something boring. My teens enjoy this addictive game, too....gets progressively harder.
B0091QS88K|5.0|My little brother and sis play it alot.  My brother is little so its hard to drag some things to the bowl so he grabs my finger and does it! My sister is 5 and she can play it without help. It has good graphics. It only has three different things to cook but it keeps them busy! =)
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|this game looks awesome and I wanted to try it since I saw the movie but it takes up 300+ Mb just for video and images when the game only takes up 14 mb. this is not cool
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed playing. Interesting story line, hidden objects with option to play matching cards instead if you desire, and challenging puzzles. Good game.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The opening scenes leading up to the crash were just preliminary metaphorical glimpses of this man's life living with addiction.  We had had two planes crashes in this movie.  The first one plus the second at the hearing.  Both times, he sat in the pilots chair and both times....lives were saved.  Excellent movie.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Not very entertaining. Guess you have to be into fairy tales more than I am. Was expecting something entirely different.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Bright, large numerals, easy to use. More options than I will use. Never lost. Always where I can find it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfers is a very fun and addicting game. Only bad thing is if you have to redownload it you will lose everything you have earned. I was at multiplier 30 and had almost every player then it froze and now I have nothing. That is VERY annoying.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game I highly recommend it to any one I love it its quite a creative game
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved The Room. All the puzzles, and mystery. It was so much fun finishing it!! I can't wait for the next The Room!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This so allows me to do things on my computer from anywhere. Whether I forgot to shutdown my computer, or just want to do something while I'm away, this app just works.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What a great movie! It really lived up to all the hype about it. Wish there were more movies out there that were so well done.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Downloaded as the free app of the day and installed a few days later. I've tried other remote desktop applications and the user interface wasn't so friendly. Needless to say, when I installed this, I started out skeptical. After actually using it, my outlook changed. Setup was a breeze and the interface is very intuitive...and I didn't even watch the tutorial video.<br /><br />If you have been apprehensive to use a remote desktop application...don't wait. This is a great app which has performed flawlessly for me so far.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|My wife has watched this movie until I am sick of it.  I have had a belly full of this until the music (which is great) send me into fits of rage making me want to bite the heads off snakes.  OK maybe not but I am super tired of it.  But this was for my wife and since I love her I got it for her.  God bless her she loves it so I put HER rating here.  Hehe...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is perfect. You can see how much time you have left on WiFi or if u are listening to music and so much more!the best part is its free!!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We really enjoyed watching it. I look forward to watching it again someday. Often when I read a book before watching a movie I am disappointed, but I wasn't this time at all.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I thought it would be fun until I turned off the kindle. About 20 minutes later I want to play so the game is loaded. And then I have to unlock every shark I had all over again. It also freezes all the time. :(
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Not a good movie. Very contrived. Situations not believable. Trailers were better than the movie. Just plain did not like it.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This is a pretty entertaining hide and seek game.  It is a little difficult to find some of the shape items because it is not clear what you should be looking for also some items are just off the screen.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|Purchased this headset for my son to play on his PS3.  For many multiplayer games (like Little Big Planet) it allows him to talk to his fellow players if they have a headset as well.  Connecting/pairing the headset was easy through the PS3 setting menus and once paired it reconnects automatically every time he uses the PS3.  The volume is fine for him (at max level) and he says that he can hear the other players well and they are able to understand him well.  The headset is only used for voice, all other game sounds still go through the TV/sound system.  This can not be configured (at least I did not see how), so this headset does not allow him to play with ALL sound coming through the headset.  I believe this is by design of the PS3 bluetooth capability.  He gets at least 3-4 hours of playing time on a charge, but he is very good charging it between sessions, so he has not yet run out of battery during a session.  He finds the set comfortable with the following considerations (hence the four stars):<br />1. He is not wearing the set with the ear piece all the way in his ear, since he claims that this starts hurting after a while.  It is more resting at the entrance of his ear canal.<br />2. As a result, when he gets very excited in a game and starts jumping up and down (what do you expect, he is nine!), the headset sometimes falls off, but it seems to be sturdy so it is still working fine.<br />Overall he is very happy with the headset and it has added a whole new dimension to his multiplayer games.  As a parent I would recommend though to instruct your child clearly that they should not share any information with other players regarding name or location.  He always plays in the family room with a parent close by and he is good at following this instruction.
1616550414|5.0|This not only shipped and arrived quickly, but it also blew my mind. The amount of information on the Zelda universe in this book is unbelievable. My brain can barely handle it it's all so awesome and well written. Would have given 10 out of 5 stars if I could
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was wonderful to become interested in reading Sparks once again as I found his stories- this one included- just as hard to put down once started as they have always been,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very fun game you have to unlock some games but it is so fun and easy.  I love it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't even have this app and I watched videos from 3 to 5 hours today just so intertaned and now I know it would be worth it!
B000BNX3B4|5.0|A charming movie, often overlooked in favor of bigger names like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, but Diane Lane is divine and John Cusack lovers will love him in this. I have seen this movie many times and I finally ordered it for my DVD library because it's that good.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie.  A nice combination of suspense, courtroom drama and human emotions.  As usual, Denzel is very convincing in the role of the pilot.
1476712042|5.0|A book that anyone can't put down.  Well written.  Can't wait for the next book in line to make my list
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Though I hadn't read a Nicolas Sparks book in quite some time, I found that this one was equally as hard to put down and just as well written as each one of his I had read previously.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|palmer, ellie, oh yes. this movie is so old but its still awesome. the book is awesome but I will not be that dude... \\"the book was better\\" that's BS. you can party with this movie or make love, it's that good.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I am not customarily a viewer of this kind of film but am going through a period of watching to see what is happening. Cannot, therefore, speak as The Voice of Experience, make comparisons with others in the series or in other series. I got a kick out of it, not because of anything it says or means, but because of the pyrotechnics as seen, as we used to say in a more primitive period, in my low-fi outfit. Had seen the predecessor but have watched too much other content since then, so that I was in the dark for the first few scenes until I grabbed hold of the thread of what to watch for here. Not sure it made any difference how good the actors were, probably they did well since I had nothing to complain of. Naturally, with all that cockamamie dialogue endemic to sci-fi films, I don't expect that even a Spencer Tracy or Ronald Colman (to pick just two guys or knew how to deliver the written word admirably) could make sci-fi speech sound other than it is.<br />So for others like me, I commend this heartily, with only the advice that the more electronic-gadget-laden and the larger the screen, the more enjoyable the movie is likely to be.
B0049P1VHS|1.0|This is a well done series in terms of quality, production, acting, etc., and I know I am in the minority. But, when I was half way through the first episode!!! and the &#34;dead&#34; ate the living horse, I ejected it and dumped it in the garbage. I do not care for &#34;gratuitous&#34; violence and surely there are ways, as have been executed on classic movies, to portray true horror without extreme graphic violence. This was not for me although I understand its underlying appeal.
B005PTYP70|5.0|We enjoyed all three movies but the first and the third movie we enjoyed th best!  If you enjoy watching Tom cruise action movies, then this set is for you!
0446547603|5.0|If movie is like the book, it will be a hit with the woman.  Well written, and kept you glue to the chair.  Hated putting it down but grabbed it the first thing in the morning.. Super great book
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book!  Great read...this book leaves you guessing till the end.  Awesome twists..love how it was written...for a great read I recommend this book!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|A lot of content for free. Great gameplay. If you like temple run and iron man you'll be in heaven.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is very informative and eye opening.  Glad to have found it and excited to start practicing his teachings.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Fun great to pass time with and keeps my mind alert. Fast paced how ever I do prefer ruzzel though
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun graphics, simple objectives and controls with mindless hours of fun! What more could you want? Stop reading this and get it already!
B009LMTDL0|3.0|You can read the book, and it's good, but if you've followed the press around the book, you know the core thesis already and there's not that much left to be gained in reading the rest of the book.
B003BYYDXW|4.0|I chose it because I heard a lot about Justin Bieber, he's a good singer, and I like his music.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What can I say? The one that came with it gave out after three months. The replacement is fine. but I've only had it a month. The five stars are as much for the service as for the product..
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Good game for a phone or tablet but very repetitive. Also I do not paying to unlock new things. Still enjoyable though.
B00498YZH8|5.0|The book is better of course, but the movie is fantastic as well! Both show a world that is horrifying but very real.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It works like it should. Like advertised, this lets you access yahoo on your kindle.<br />I have had no glitches, screw ups, or crashes.
0307389839|5.0|Murakami makes connections with life and running that reach into a person's being. Easy reading, relaxing and enjoyable, Highly recommend this book to anyone with a passion for physical activity and how meaningful it is in someone's life.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I got this originally because my son loves Vikings. We watched every episode because we loved it. This is a well done show with excellant acting.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Have grand kids and neighbors  who are  in love with tom and ginger.  Makes me feel good to be able to amuze  them. I am 78<br />and it puts me in touch with the little ones. Pat J
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't wait to read the ending. Who was going to win the uprising?<br />I liked the ending. I was surprised.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I will not buy this or any other set until they bring back the first theater versions. The first Star Wars I saw over 30 times in the theaters. I know...lol
B006PKV2QU|5.0|I enjoy this book as much as my four year old son does.  The great illustrations are cute and fit the story perfectly. The rhymes have a fun way of building up to a climax and my son joins in with &#34; ...but maybe not&#34;.  Highly recommended.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a great game.  Lots of dinosaurs that come from the movie.  Had trouble with ..the game freezing up and then exiting but is better now.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Everything you want in an alarm app. You can set as many alarms as you need for the week. Easy to use. Hasn't let me down yet.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. My husband likes the fact that I can change the background color so the screen isn't as bright and disturbing to him when he's trying to rest :-) . Great books available on amazon, too!
B0049A9BSY|3.0|I've had issues with this sequel ever since it came out. I was underwhelmed in theaters after the first film released in 2008 onto the big screen. The sequel attempts to continue in ... some kind .... of direction but lacks in effort. The humor in this film is great, the four main characters are all at their wits best - well all but Carrie (sorry she's a bit of a sour lemon in this SATC take). Samantha (as always) takes the comedic award along side a now, seemingly bubbly / less uptight Miranda. I don't know if this was Michael Patrick King's answer to the extreme drama of the first film - but it somehow lacks in all that ... glitters about the original series / franchise. I know fashion was intended as an extra &#34;set / scene &#34; of sorts, as has always been but - this film has NOTHING to do with New York and really lacks in the original appeal to the series. I don't see why we had to travel across the globe to allow Mrs. Bradshaw-Preston to seemingly ... (spoiler) &#34;cheat&#34; on Big. The story arc did nothing more than ... piss me off as it was so expected, so ... rehearsed.<br /><br />On to the DVD - I bought it as part of the &#34;collection&#34; but I honestly feel that its something I would only watch on a summer night with gay friends and a few trendy females (and lets face it . . .THAT is a RARE rare obnoxious occasion, unless the boys are cute and they are divided by two multiplied by one ... aka date night) But I don't know that this would be a film I 'd care to share with a date, and what's it mean anyways if he's in your home watching this film ? .  . hmmm.<br /><br />Fantasy aside, this is a film / DVD packaging best met with sub-hardcore fans. The &#34;extras&#34; pose nothing more than another foray into fashion and the at times - kiss her (((()))) world of Pat Field (god bless her, she's a lot of fun) but - I really would rather see a behind the scenes blooper reel/making of mini docu and more. I don't care about Alicia Key's in the recording studio - I'd rather get to know the additional information / stories we didn't see on film.studio - I'd rather get to know the additional information / stories we didn't see on film.
B001JIDE3M|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie.  It had some corny spots, but it was clean, fun.  One often can't find a movie as clean as this.  We were surprised because we weren't expecting it to be good.  We just have rented so many family movies since we had a lot  of our snow days this school year so  we gave it a try.  We would recommend it!
0385349831|5.0|I had read AlephI and found it very interesting reading. Then Manuscript Found in Accra was recommended by a mentor and I ordered it immediately. What a profound book! It's like all the answers to everything you were ever searching for all in one book! Paulo Coelho is a master!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|what a great job of putting togerther the story of King Arthur and Merlin. I really enjoy ever episode. Love the actors too they do a great job.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|pretty good game based on temple run. upgradable amor is a plus. you have to play a lot though to get anywhere
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is a game you have to have because it's fun as crap because you get to kill stuff
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't wait for this next one... I think what really draws you in is the flaws of the characters they don't just do and say the right things. I like that as the story progresses subplots and back stories get brought to light. I think that the fact that's its not just a battle for a prince, but also has so much going on really does it for me. Read it!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|An absolute horrible movie.  It was extremely violent to the point of stupid.  I couldn't believe this was nominated for awards.  It was a total waste of time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is very addicting, once you start you cant stop. love it! I recommend this game for any fans of templerun.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A great read, that will leave you with a surprise at the end.  Wonderful characters. Kate weaves a wonderful story.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|I bought this to try to play an old 78, but it did not spin the right speed to play the record correctly.
B00BPA2PBG|1.0|The movie is great of course. But when they released this on blu in 09 it should of looked.great in the first place. Now someone wants people.to fork over more money? ! Nooo thanx. If anything they should re realse it in 3D. Tons have 3Dthe tvs. 4K is waaaaay to early and completly pointless. It will never catch on. THERE IS NO DIFFRENCE IN PICTURE QUALITT BETWEEN A GOOD LED TV AND 4Kthe TV. unless ur watchin tv on a 75 inch screen or bigger. That means no more tv stands. That means u have a small apartment or studii apartment u cant buy one cuz the tvs are waaay to big. Gotta have a big bare wall to hang it on and sit back 15the feet at least. And then u cant see a diffrence in picture becuz ur to far away. 4k is a joke. NO ONE EVER POPS IN A GREAT BLU RAY MOVIE ON A 1080P TV AND SAYS \\" MAN THIS PICTURE LOOKS LIKE CRAP\\" blu rag looks perfect to 99%the of america. We dont need 4 times better as they claim.(which its only 2timesa better) but its all so pointless amd at least a decade to early. If 95the percent of the country doesnt own a 75 inch tv or 90 inch tv now?! Why would they soon? No ome owned them 10to years ago. 20 years ago. No one will now. Like i said unless u havr money amd a huge living room amd think that 7.1 surround sound and blu ray picture looks like total crap!. Then ya ull buy it lol. O amd NOTHING IS MADR IN 4K. no tv shows. No movies. Nothing. Hell most tv shows r only 720p. Cost waaaay to much to make 1080p. So 4Kthe is pointless. Enough is enough.
B000FC1IPO|5.0|The struggle to be a career success and good mother is very accurately portrayed in a very enjoyable, quick read.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|Prior to being released, Iron Man 3 had a lot to live up to. Not only was it the third installment in the wildly successful Iron Man series, it was also the first movie in the Marvel universe to be released after the record-shattering and ultimate team-up flick, The Avengers. With the charismatic Robert Downey Jr. once again in the title role, and with the addition of veteran screenwriter Shane Black at the helm, Iron Man 3 officially kicks off the second phase of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, and brings us Tony Stark in his most vulnerable state yet.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 is a completely different animal than the previous two films in the series. Rather than overusing the spectacle of the Iron Man armors like the previous film, Iron Man 3 tells us the story of the man beneath the armor. In fact, this is very much a story about Tony and his beliefs, and shows the playboy philanthropist donning the armor only a handful of times throughout the movie. There are elements in the film not typically found in superhero flicks, along with underlying themes that really add to the story including the war or terror, propagandization, and revenge. It gives us Tony Stark at the most vulnerable point in his time as Iron Man, and tells a great story of a man trying to reconcile his past.<br /><br />This movie is very much a Shane Black film that's filled with witty dialogue and choppy quips, and has a definite \\"buddy cop\\" feel to it. Black, the writer behind Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, is a master of smart and pop culture injected lines, of which there is no actor better suited to deliver than RDJ. The direction Black has taken the character tells a darker tale than has been told before, but the outcome is one that works very well.<br /><br />As it turns out, the movie I saw ended up being very different from the one I expected to see...in a good way. The story contains some twists that I did not see coming, and that the marketing team did a good job of hiding in the trailers. There's some spectacular action sequences, particularly the aerial rescue and the final thirty minutes, and a lot more humor than the trailers will have you believe. There's also some memorable performances from the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow, who is given a more action-oriented role, Don Cheadle, who has some fun back-and-forth exchanges with RDJ, Ben Kingsley as the memorable Mandarin (and who steals the show by the way), and Guy Pearce as the mysterious and manipulative Aldrich Killian. I was also pleasantly surprised by the casting of youngster Ty Simpkins, who, somehow, manages to out-banter Tony Stark.<br /><br />It may not be as high-flying or action-packed as the previous films, but it's a very worthy successor to The Avengers, and a terrific addition to the Marvel universe.ilers.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This is a good movie.  It isn't my favorite in the Marvel collection but it is good once I get into it.  And it is a must-have for my collection of Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and The Avengers.  My collection is now complete with the movies that have come out so far -- Iron Man 3 will be out soon!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful for me to see how much time I have left for different things like reading, web, etc.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I can't remember the last time I wateched a G-rated movie. This one was recommended to me by a friend who is a dog lover. It is an extremenly moving movie and the fact it is based on a true story makes it even more compelling. It made me want to visit Japan just to see the statue of Hachi. For a similarly moving experience read the short story: \\"Yudisthira at Heaven's Gate\\" in the \\"The Book of Virtues.\\"
B002W2U3H4|5.0|This is a good movie to have in your holiday collection if you have one.  Worth watching, especially if you have some young kids with you at the time, but you'll enjoy it even if you don't.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Obviously didn't read the details that closely when I downloaded and didn't realize it required a Facebook account.  I don't have one of those and don't have any desire to have one.  Therefore I removed this version of angry birds.
B00B935SUY|5.0|It is pretty great that such a little studio could leave such an impact on music. This little story gets a little melodramatic about tape; Neil Young is full of bunk about his understanding of technology (but alas, he is 1) old, and 2) Canadien), but is spot on when it comes to room shape, live performance, and the sweet, sweet, sound of the board.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a horrendous movie on all counts.  I think the most offensive thing about the film is that it actually tries to tell a story about our realistic US president Abraham Lincoln actually growing up to become physically powerful and vengeful as a result of his mother being killed, but... it tastelessly centers around vampires.  To me this is incredibly stupid.  It also shows a clear lack of creative ideas on the part of Hollywood.  What's next, RoboCop\\" Vampire Hunter?  How about Albert Einstein vs. zombies?  If THIS is what movies have now resorted to, count me out.<br /><br />Anyway it's a major flaw in my opinion to try and write a storyline around the actual real life of Abraham Lincoln but deliberately sabotage it by turning it into a generic vampire-slicing film.  Why bother writing a script when nobody's going to believe it?  Unless you live under a rock and have zero idea who Honest Abe is.  C'mon.  It's not even a horror, and not just because vampires aren't really scary and don't appeal to me it the least.  It's because instead of seeing bucket loads of blood or a pleasant build up of suspense and atmosphere, you're forced to witness intolerable and overused Matrix-style far-fetched killings that just go on and on.  To me this is a letdown of gigantic proportions.<br /><br />Don't watch Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.  It's worse than even the title suggests.  Even worse, the film actually caught on and became popular.  The future of movie tastes scares me more than this movie ever will.
B0094M2SCI|4.0|It's really a fun movie and the whole Amazon Prime free viewing really improves my ability to enjoy cool B action SciFi flix.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Where else are you going to find a comparable cast:  Lemmon, Pacino, Spacey, Harris, Arkin, and even cameo with Alec Baldwin & his steel balls?  With Mamet's snappy, idiosyncratic dialogue, this movie is the gold standard of star power.  IMHO, Al Pacino's best performance of his career as Richard Romo.  Those close-ups of Pacino in the bar!!!!  Who knew he had green eyes!  Most seductive performance of his career.  But the other performances by these universal Academy Award winners are none too shabby either.  from itcan
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I liked all the classes represented with the current events of the time.  I thought the details of the heirachy and levels of status among the servant class was very enligihtening for me.<br />The acting and story lines made it a must see on my schedule.<br />I look forward to the next season.<br /><br />Thanks to PBS of Kentucky
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A masterwork that will go down in history.  A fitting end to a wonderful journey.<br />Let the Dragon ride...<br /><br />Thank You.
0142437611|1.0|What is it with this novel? Depressing, boring and yet a \\"must-read\\" classic of American literature.<br />Disliked the tone, color, characters and yes, the writing. Painful and dull.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Absolutely favorite game!!!  I have tried other bingo games online but none compare to Bingo Blitz! It is the sole reason I keep my facenook active.  If I could just log on through the app and still have all my keys and power ups and credits I would.
B0011Z51QG|4.0|The most amazing thing about Prince is truly his liver performances. After seeing him this past season at SXSW, I was more than a converted fan, I was reborn. The simplistic production styles on his neo funk albums allow so much musical variation live, that even if you like half of the genius on this record, you will be overwhelmed by any performance you see. An another note, Darling NIkki is absolutely one of my all time favorite songs for a number of reasons. It's sexy, it's been covered by sexy artists like the Foo Fighters, and it's the reason that Tipper Gore saw fit to institute the ADULT WARNING label on CD's.<br /><br />Prince is a total flirt and some people can handle it and some cannot.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|It's a great animated movie, totally worth it to watch! And check out the special features! It's a must buy.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|This app requiers permissions it nor any other app needs. This is crappie. Because of this I rejected it fully.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It seemed like Stephen King had difficulty with the dismount, at the end of what had been a very entertaining and well researched story.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This movie wasn't quite as funny as I thought it was going to be, but it was still a good movie!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The Life of Pi.  The water scenes were gorgeous and I have watched it 3 times now.  I loved it.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I am not a Gaiman-ite or a zelot of his writing but I found American Gods to be the right mixture of over the top melodrama and suspense, mixed with the loud personalities of this great melting pot's religious figures. Although notably missing is Jesus Christ from the line up, American Gods does a great job of taking the concept of worship historically and using it in a modern context. How would the tangible personalities of Greek, Nordic, and Druid traditions deal with being forgotten or replaced with the modern American's hunger for possessions?<br /><br />Fun read and hard to put down I would recommend anyone take a crack at this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is another well written, enjoyable book by Nicholas Sparks. I'm sure this story portrays some real life struggles that many can relate to. Sparks has that gift of making you feel just what the characters are going through. This book is easy to read and hard to put down. Sure to please.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This app is fun I would recommend it for everybody. It is good for toddlers and older kids. My nephew loves to plat it!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie was wonderful, but amazons streaming kept messing up at the last half hour. Quite frustrating, the screen kept freezing and we'd have to wait five minutes for it to start up again
B005AFB69E|5.0|The cast, plot and story line are first rate.  The background score does not match the plot, story or the first rate cast.  However, that<br />should not stop buyers from purchasing this film.  It is a great story.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Get this in 3D it was awesome. It was a great story that left you wondering which one was fact and which one was fiction. We're still wondering which one was the true account.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I had a friend that had one kind of like it and let me play once . When Amazon offered it I wanted to get and try . I love it I play it offen and it's some mind exerise in away and once played you just want to play more .<br /><br />Carol
B009GFEOY8|1.0|Came in the mail a year expired. The pictures come out super dark. Only comes with 8 vs. 10. Feel like It was a rip off. Going to buy fujifilm camera and film it's way more affordable and quality is much better.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Was working with a friend building a new PC. He had run this type cooler for his set up, so it was ordered from Amazon, and arrive d in good time. And has been a cool breeze for my CPU every since. This unit offers good cooling and expandibility. Comes with only one fan although the picture shows two, but is set up so you can acquire a second and mount it if your need calls for. What I like is that it has a metal sub plate that mounts under the mobo so you don't have to worry about press in anchors pulling out. The instructions are a bit vague but average intellligance will pull you through. A word of caution. This stands around 7.25 in above your mobo, so make sure your case cover will clear the tower when closed. I had to purchase a case to fit, a Black Widow gaming case or something in those dimensions will work. The fans clip on to the tower in four plays and fit snug. And will work with any board that employs multiple speed settings that adjusts according to need. A good buy at a good price.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Gee ready to spend all your free time with this game. Truly a fun and enjoyable game. Must get and see for yourself.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Awesome just like the first but with more stuff and more characters to play as but all in all a good game
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have loved playing the game Bejeweled for over ten years,  and this is just as good.  Love to play it while waiting for others..
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Suspenseful and believable acting. There was some gore, but the horror was mostly supernatural. W were captivated through the entire movie.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|Amazon made good on one of the power cords I had because the coating disintegrated. I have three Kindles in my family and all three have disintegrated now. I'm sure they will fix the problem, soon, I hope but in the meantime I have to order two more. They are a fire hazard with the silver wires showing throught.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I took this external charger to Disney with me.  I was able to use my iPhone as much as I wanted. Amazing!!! I super recommend! It takes more time to charge the iPad, but it charges the iPhone in no time!! If you plug it before running out of battery, it will run normally and even show a full battery meter while is plugged. After the charge is complete, you can unplug it.  Also, make sure to press the button, so you will hear the alert of the phone being charged.  The light of the battery will turn off, but your device will be charged when plugged.<br /><br />I love this product!!! Also I was not sure about the light turning off itself and as soon as I got in touch with the costume service, they responded promptly, explaining that the light turns of so it saves its energy. Great support!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I ordered this as a gift and it came on time as well as perfect condition!<br />Let's just say that my boyfriend was very impressed with my selection
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I tried this app because it looked cool and I tried. it and it is pretty cool but I wish you trade alage for pearls. or alage. for seashell.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I think that Feedly is going through some major changes right now, so my review may change. It has a lot of great features and has been the best RSS reader I have found to replace google reader. I like both the app and the web version. My biggest complaint, and one of the things I use it for the most is to be able to search through my read articles.  I can not possibly save all the articles that I need because sometimes I am not sure I will ever use it, but when I do need an article I didn't save I have no way to search for it. I find myself having to use google reader to do that, so when they finally get rid of it I do not know what I will do, unless Feedly changes this back because at one point they did have this feature
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I download movies to watch on my airplane rides back east. This movie was enjoyable, i believed it portrayed the true life of Alfred Hitchcock and his wife.
B001EBV0OY|4.0|Good storyline.&#34; I'd pay to watch the same movie again...&#34;. Morgan and Tim both put up a good show of their talent...
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|this album along with Thickfreakness, Rubber Factory and Big Come Up is one of the best albums by these guys, Blues/Garage Rock GOLD, you can just play the album with out wanting to skip a track, the way music should be made...with heart and soul
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was my first action game on Kindle HD. This is lots of fun, and very engaging. Forces a smile. Thanks!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I've never been big on reading, but lately I've been trying to pick up books. This one was great. I couldn't put it down. I'd stay up for hours at night reading. It's an easy read and really intriguing. I enjoyed it a lot and recommend it to others
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|Other reviews give you the concept of 'The First Pillar', no need to repeat them.<br /><br />I am both pleased and disappointed with this book.<br /><br />Pleased because Mr. Huff has created a rich, interesting story with some facinating characters and immersive worlds. I know that I'm going to read more of the series to see what happens and to learn more about the back story and other worlds.<br /><br />Disapppointed because I wanted more. I wanted to understand why characters did what they did, not just be told that they did it. In many places it reads very much like a screenplay, telling me that this character does that without letting me get 'inside' the characters thoughts and emotions.<br /><br />In several places I got caught up in an impending battle or action and it was over in a few sentences. Mr. Huff missed several opportunities to light up my imagination and draw me into the scene.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have said, the target audience for this series is probably the young adult. As such, Mr. Huff has a very good first book in that genre. And even though that is his intended reader, I confess I want to read more of this series.<br /><br />Keep writing Roy, you have an excellent series concept and I look forward to seeing your progress as a writer as well.
0786962984|5.0|My 7 year old is not old enough for D&D but has been begging to play it since his uncle told him it exists.<br />Then a friend told us about Dungeon Board Game. It's a gateway to a roll playing game. Falls somewhere between candyland and D&D. My son was so excited when it arrived he almost imploded. It's a lot of fun. Simple. And the amazon price made it worth trying out. I give it 5 stars in the making my family happy department.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great movie and I seriously can't wait for the fourth season. Wow...I'd pay to watch the entire season again. Thumbs up to the entire &#34;Walking Dead&#34; crew!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I find it easy to use and most convenient.  Keys are large enough to be easy to use and it has a good touch-feel to it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game to play while you are drink or on drugs!!<br />no skill is required. kick back and let the fun begin.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|The DVDs were what I wanted.  My only disappointment is that the 30th Anniversary Edition is NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED.  I have viewed episodes on Cable TV that WERE closed captioned,  However, Mr Olivier's speaking voice is such that the disappointment is minor.
B006XBSAP2|3.0|The tracks on this album that didn't get a lot or any radio airplay are snoozers, and I found out that I prefer several of the easily-available remixes on this album so I don't really listen to the album as much as I thought I would. It's not bad, it's just that when I buy an album I expect I'm going to like more than the three-four singles that got overplayed.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Forget redeeming value.  Enjoy the ride.<br />If you want a summary/review, there's plenty out there.<br /><br />Welcome to Winter River, museum of natural greed; a monument to the bored businessman!<br />It's showtime!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is always fun plus when you update it all your progress comes with it that is why I love it tell them why you love it
B008XG1X18|1.0|This app was wonderful, till the last update. Now, it won't even load, all I get is a blank white screen. What gives? FIX IT PLEASE!!!!!!!
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Lets be real OF tight. Wolf was amazing, if you haven't heard it, you're missing out. Tyler did his thing that's for sure.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read her latest book and decided to try this one. Her books are good, just slow to get moving. Once they do I am pleasantly surprised.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many ideas.... so little time.<br />Love all the craft and gardening ideas, have already done a few & lots more planned!
0345803507|5.0|Well I was very happy to find this book. Now this summer I will have my books ready for me to read after I have my knee replaced. Thank you!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Makes me feel very secure about the security of my camera.  Going to buy one for my mom for Christmas.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Have always loved his voice. Disappointed by Rainy Night in Georgia, but love the instrumentals late in the cd. Boz's voice is as good as ever.
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|Man, what a difference seeing this film in blu-ray. My DVD copy seems blurry compared to this. I could make out so much more detail. Love it!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I love how the secondary currency inst impossible to get. most other card games I got bored with quickly but this kept he hooked
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love this album - a great album to relax too. Much more to enjoy than just the title track 'Hey Ho'.
0425263908|5.0|If you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey, you'll love this. I am counting down the days for the 3rd books to come out. Well written, and not predictable.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|I DLed this last night and didn't have time to listen to it.  I was going to listen to a few cuts while I was doing something in the room, and got sucked in.  Every cut is strong enough that I had to listen to the whole album.
B00AU15HPC|1.0|Just a bunch of rhyming lines. Played it a couple of times and don't even know where the CD is now.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Courtroom dramas are my favorites, so I've seen many of them.  I love this show, and although I give much of the credit to the understated acting abilities of Margulies, Charles, Baranski, et. al., I also think that the scripts are smart and interesting.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is an easy to play match game.  You can turn the music off, which is nice.  Though it comes back on if you turn off your phone.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because my network monitor mini shows network action when I turn it on.  I don't share scores on twitter or whatever, so I don't know why there is network action.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|This is a classic movie.  It was very entertaining even with how low tech it was compared to today's movies.  We kept wondering how much of an influence could this movie have been to Star Trek.
B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|Not a good idea for a kid who is splitting time with mom/dad. he didn't get to open them all until after Christmas
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very funny quick read.  Suggest any woman looking for a fun read check this out. It would be a good plane read.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Kind of country rock with a definite Kenny Loggins influence. Everyone should relate to &#34;You're not the boss of me&#34;. &#34;Another Spring&#34; is beautiful.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie  but to short Ill watch it again .Nothing like a Hobbit movies to warm the toes.And wish you had hairy feet in the winter time .
B00002E224|5.0|A pleasant, sometimes almost too slow-paced movie about young romance.  I can't speak for others, but many of the conversations were reminiscent of days gone by for me.  Good memories!
0345529057|2.0|You have to really want to read these books to do so!  Don't buy this unless you are sure you want to!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I didn't realize you HAD to play against people, I thought the title mean friends of the angry birds ,not angry birds you have to play with your friends, I have no friends on facebook who play angry birds.I have deleted this game.
0385349947|5.0|I started reading this for me and found it very helpful for lessons to teach my daughter.  Her dad will start reading it soon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The reading plans and daily Scriptures are amazing! I enjoy starting my day with a word from the Bible. I recommend to anyone who doesn't have the app already.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I've read this entire series. They are all exciting and enjoyable reads.  Very well written.<br />All I could ask for.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I couldn't put it down! The content is very deep as well as absolutely crucial. The writing is beautiful... Truly a masterpiece and must-read!
B001EBV0P8|5.0|Read this book with my 11th graders and showed them the movie.  They loved it and couldn't wait to read/watch more!
B001B6EAOY|5.0|CR-5400 works as expected and supports 16gb and above micro-sd cards.  Works well with PSP-3000 series and 2000 series but memory card may need to be formatted if removed repeatedly from adapter.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|this Death Star seemed liked forever putting it together (2 days) the instruction booklet was on the mark and anyone who collects star wars stuff this is a must have!
B00866H7SS|5.0|I found this book really addictive and enjoyable. Like fifty shades of grey but with a better story line and I read it in no time at all.
B004N8CP8K|5.0|Remote admin when you really need it (but don't want it) like on vacation...LoL  I have separate entries for servers when connected to the local network and the internet, even allows you to connect to non-standard ports for a little extra obfuscation.
B0037VNX44|3.0|Not what I thought it would be, but better than average for what it was. Did not like the way the story was told.
B000X4GXT0|5.0|This is a great movie - Don't let the age of the play fool you - Romeo can be found wandering the streets of NYC in 2013!!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It,s  a little to tame for the average  player but I really should not  knock a  freebie  that cost me anything
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The seller shipped my item sooner than estimated which made us very happy when we received the dvd days before expected. When ordering, be sure to check that you're ordering a format which is compatible with your machine; they're region specific. I would definitely order from this company again.
0099580578|4.0|These books have an excellent love story, but I'm not sure I'm crazy over them as some others reviews I read. Good books, but don't see the hype.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Just love it! I don't watch TV ever but this show has gotten me addicted! I hope it continues to be a great show!
B005LAII8A|1.0|I don't think I've ever given a movie a 1 star review. Sadly, if I could have given it a zero, no wait, a NEGATIVE star I would have. I appreciate what Joseph-Gordon was trying to do, but to me he tried a little too hard to copy Bruce Willis' facial expressions and just came off looking like he'd been sucking on lemons all his life.  Oh yeah, the premis was stupid and kind of hard to follow.
B00628RFPM|5.0|Love this movie - read the book with my 11th graders and although it was from a child's point of view, they loved it!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love this game it the best game I ever played plus I ad it to my phone what a grate game you need try it you will love it
B008C20TDG|5.0|Day 27: I recommend \\"It Starts with Food\\" by Dallas & Melissa Hartwig. Renea Vogel﻿ recommended I read the book last summer I believe and I bought the e-book and read it. I thought it was interesting but didn't put too much stock into it because of all the \\"diets\\" I had been on in the past. When she came to visit in October she talked to me and answered some Paleo questions I had and it got me curious again - so I read through it and thought hmm, it clearly helps her. So I started eliminating a few things here and there. But after I visited her early in April, I came home with a new resolve. While I was there, she showed me how she shopped, did a weekly cook up, and explained more about what The Whole 30 has done for her. As soon as I got home - I poured through the pages of the book with an understanding I had never had before! So I said - this is for ME and I will succeed. I immediately put into practice what I had learned from the book and Renea. I am in so much less pain-almost none except the self-inflicted from exercise, I am no longer bloated or having any gastro issues of any kind, I have loads of energy-enough to exercise! I didn't have any cravings until about the 20th day because I was so focused but I have pushed through it and persevered. I want to eat like this for the rest of my life! I have never felt that way about the way I was eating. It is so important to me that I will work extra days at whatever job I need to in order to buy whole foods and organic foods - because I would rather have a large food bill than large medical bills and I want my family to be healthy too!! Oh - and the bonus, I have lost 10 pounds in 27 days and several inches! Thank you Dallas & Melissa and thank you Renea - you have given me the best gift I have ever received!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game this is the first time I have bought a cut the rope game and I really like it and it is fun
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|This is an incredible documentary, but a missed opportunity on several levels with this release.  First, the official release should have had extra unseen footage and interviews not seen in the early Showtime release earlier this year.  Give us die hard fans a little bonus for going out and buying the big package.  Second, have some additional \\"bonus\\" side footage or lost footage not seen in the documentary and not part of the documentary.  We want to see it badly.  This documentary should stand as the \\"official\\" historical document for the band...make it count.  Finally, the Capital Theatre footage should have been the entire concert.  It is the most amazing footage I have ever seen regarding The Eagles...beautifully shot on film with just the most incredible hi-fi sound imaginable.  This band was so good it was just stupid...they were stupid good!  Give us the entire show for Christ's sake...  This was the band at the zenith of their career.  If you think you know good...you simply don't if you haven't seen this Capital Theatre footage.  They redefine excellence.<br />Ok, so what they did do right was give us the classic line-up with with Randy Meisner on bass.  What an incredibly underrated musician and singer.  The man played the most incredible bass lines and sang like an angel all whilst locking in with Henley and anchoring the band into a cohesive 747 Jetliner.  Too bad he didn't hold on for just a little longer as the Eagles only lasted three more years.  They were never the same after he left.  You can only replace so many members of a group before you lose the essence and energy of what you once had and what made you special.  The loss of Don Felder is another example.  How can you replace Don Felder?  It simply isn't possible and while the new guy plays the parts...it isn't with the same essence and energy.  The peak of their career was with these five guys: Henley, Frey, Meisner, Felder, Walsh.  After the breakup of this classic line-up, the band self-destructed.  The end.<br />In a nutshell, give us more vintage material because we will buy it.  Don't wait so long that your audience grows too old and eventually no longer cares!!!
B00AEFXL5W|1.0|Two of my friends love this movie and when I told them I didn't they encouraged me to watch it again. Try as I might, I cannot say anything good about this movie. Well, actually, the music is great and George Peppard is easy on the eyes. However Micky Rooney should have had his actors guild card taken away after this role and to this day I cannot understand the reason for casting him. Surely they could have found a male Asian actor (ironically there was an Asian woman in a background scene) to play the role and eliminated the bafoonery. On top of that the movie was just flat out boring. I wrote a review earlier where I said I'd never given a movie one star. Now this is the second. I hope this is not a trend.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Excellent movie.  I highly recommend it. Great story and the scenery is beautiful.  If you like this series, this is a must see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game that no mater how young or old you are you will still have fun with it
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great romantic comedy with well developed characters. Bradley cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were fantastic. Definitely a movie to watch again

B0070DOHQS|4.0|The app is really Good but a little laggy sometimes besides that the app is well developed and nearly almost flawless.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love this game. Very relaxing. Great graphics. Love the chase, feeding and tricks each animal does. Like most gameloft games its hurry up and wait or spend money but graphics and storyline r great

B000FA675C|4.0|I couldn't put the book down. The art work that was talk about made you picture in your mind what clue was revealed during the story. Trying to figure out who was the teacher and who was the good guy and bad guy. The book keep going in different directions. Great action and kept me wanting more...
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse seemed to have a lot of features of the more expensive mice at a much lower price. So far, it's worked great.<br /><br />The only thing is that the extra buttons have to be mapped to keyboard buttons (very easy to do on the fly with the included software), and aren't their own 'buttons.'<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good gaming mouse at a low price.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Moss does a great job of presenting the facts in a way that keeps you interested and wanting to learn more. It's almost as addictive as a bag of potato chips.
B00683JLXA|3.0|The game was alright. I guess I wasn't expecting a version of angry birds with different animals. The game played well, I just got bored.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are a large number of mini games on here...you gotta play the ones you don't like to buy games but its easy and fun to get points to play whatever you want.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Just watched Django last night. I was a bit leary as I don't relish violent movies, Tarantino's speciality. I was pleasantly surprised right out of the gate with the humor & civility of some of the characters that wonderfully balanced the smattering of extreme violence & blood. The actors were wonderful. I did not realize the movie was nearly 3 hrs long, because I was engrossed & the time flew. A very good sign. This is now on my purchase list.

B00CL66FEQ|3.0|I was disappointed with this movie. Expected much more from Grogan and Streisand.  It was boring and slow from the beginning. Don't waste your $$$
B00008PX8P|5.0|In the 40 plus years since this group was formed. There have been thousands of amazing musicians, millions of recordings, thousands of concerts. Why is it that no one can hold a candle to these guys? What happened to music? It should keep getting better. The 70s was a long time ago. Things have advanced and changed so much yet music has not. There has been a huge amount of music made that I love. Many recordings I have listened to over and over again. I have seen hundreds of concerts and dvds and youtube videos. It is all great. But none of it can equal this group.<br />If you haven't seen this dvd you really don't know. Unless you were lucky enough to see them live.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Warning--once you start down the Downton Abbey road, you will not be able to turn off.  This is a wonderful show, well worth buying, because you can watch as many episodes as your butt will allow.  They have spared nothing in the production of the show, so it is visually stunning, but the writing is the best thing on TV.  Thank you Brits and PBS!
B008MA83HC|4.0|Quality and performance are good. It is an excellent acquisition for those who like Latin music.Mana is the best Latin rock band.

B007SGM084|5.0|Loved loved loved this series. Of course there are several sex scenes but the love story and suspense is fantastic. Recommended
B0045I3EJM|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />This is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's a true piece of art, with a story that drips with moving intense emotion, stellar acting, and visuals that hit hard just like the story. This is one of those films that during/long after will have you looking at your own life, existence, mortality, and choices in life. If there is one movie anyone has to see this year then this is it. Apparently this was one of the most expensive films in Belgium's history (60 million or so). This fact makes me think about how many current films spend far more, and are absolute garbage (A point I obviously don't have to point out, however nevertheless feel compelled to do so.). Ultimately I just hope that this amazing director (Jaco Van Dormael) has another chance, hopefully sometime very soon, to get another opportunity to let his true creative genius shine.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can you say that hasn't been said about Downton Abbey?  Fabulous acting, even better writing.  And we are enthralled with Maggie Smith.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|There is no one more skillful at advancing plot through conversation than John LeCarré. His duels between bright and alert antagonists are a thrill to follow. This book, a sort of black hole edition of Don Quixote, pits a young man of considerable skill, moral fibre and determination against the corporate-government fusion strangling civil culture, decency, and freedom and making short work of all three in these earliest years of the 21st century. It's a sobering and chillingly real book that I could not put down, taking it in in two extended draughts to the last ambiguous sentence. Now, I'll start it again
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Gave this movie to my girlfriend as a gift.  She says she feels inspired by fashion every time she sees it.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Used the filters in Jamaica.  Downloaded the videos after the dive.  The colors were spectacular!  This is a must!  Snaps on over the lens.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it. it has lasting value and requires skill. i love a challenge and it free! Great Game. Very attractive graphics.
0345529057|5.0|My favorite fiction series by far. Skip the odd chapter with the POV characters I don't enjoy, but those are few and far between. Another reviewer cited 'Lord of the Rings meets the Sopranos', and this holds very true.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love love love this show can't wait for season 3 I just can't believe that I didn't think of this myself, being the fairy tail freak that I am!!!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Was a little hesitent when this movie was in theaters but after I gave it a try on instant streaming I was definitely impressed!  Very imaginative and visually spectacular.  Liked it so much I bought it on blu-ray.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I thought it was well played; the acting was extremely good. I thought the costumes were great, the filming good, in fact everything but parts of the story. I did not find the politics of banning slavery that interesting.<br /><br />Another problem I had with the film is as I was watching it with my parents, and we are not Americans they got lost in the story. They ended out not understanding the story. I think it was only that I knew some American history that enabled me to follow the story. You do need some knowledge of American history and politics to understand this film.
0142424277|4.0|Belongs to angry narrator genre. Could have used more dispassionate narrator.  Nevertheless, hung onto every word and appreciated vivid descriptions of character and ingenious incidents in plot.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|While I give the book 4 stars meaning &#34;I like it&#34;, vs three star &#34;It's OK&#34; and I was compelled to turn the pages to see what happened, I think this is a cliche'd  writing.  It seemed to have all the typical characters that I've read or seen portrayed before.  It does remind us of the mistreatment of women and blacks and the over use of laudenum to sedate.  I could give example after example of things that didn't really jive with reality, but it was nevertheless entertaining.  How the drunken overseer got away with his bad -to say the least- behavior is hard to reconcile.  Along with the denial by the father, the captain, of what happened to the young boy (whose name escapes me) by his tudor.  The ignorance of the parents was appalling. The author took &#34;license&#34; to exaggerate on the unfolding of the story, so that by the time it was over, I was relieved and tired of it.  If you have not overdone it on plantation life stories, then you will likely enjoy the soap opera of this one.  The author certainly spices it up with the things that keep readers turning pages, but it got to be annoying on being unrealistic, to my way of thinking at least.
0880796863|5.0|I received everything as advertised. Although I don't think I'll use the box that came with the cards. The booklet that you receive with the cards seems to be an updated version. In the past I've bought this deck before, and the little booklet was thinner.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Just about the best group of great looking men(including Gabriel Iglesias) in one movie! Great music, great actors ! What more can a woman ask for? For them to be right next to you! But we have to settle for the DVD!
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|Overall it is not a bad movie, but it is not different to many other movies out there now.<br /><br />It is a shame as the film did start well but then drifted off into mediocrity. Some of the scenes were just stupid like two idiots fighting the hero in the bath, a sniper who could not shoot straight and our hero getting a knife instead of a gun. Others were just corny like the hero putting down his gun to have a fist fight.<br /><br />I did not find any of the characters very interesting.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />Overall, I will say it is watchable.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|It's cute. Not much of a storyline an easy thoughtless movie. It's cute. It will help to pass time if you have nothing else to do.
0307592731|5.0|Unlike Cheryl, I haven't lost my mother but I am slightly familiar with the area that she started her hike in.  I lived in Kern County for the first 55 years of my life and have ridden horseback in the Kern River/Lake Isabella/Walker Pass area that the PCT runs through. It is very dry and arid and I have a tough time imagining a young woman hiking alone through that area without enough water.  I'm a huge water drinker and it makes me thirsty to think about it.<br /><br />Ms. Strayed tells a compelling and very readable story.  Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down and can well imagine making the same mistakes she did with her backpack and hiking boots.  I found myself laughing out loud at some of her antics.  She is a great story teller!
B0002WZTOI|3.0|Great movie in spite of Tom Cruise and the gratuitous sex scene.
B00BXKKNFS|3.0|Power hawg. Spotty effectiveness. Listerine Why is it that these capitalist suppression apps always fail in the marketplace but not in FOSS repositories? Could it be cheating on the part of the merchant?
B00CBRADU2|3.0|I really enjoyed some of his earlier movies like predator, terminator and final recall but this one is not good.<br /><br />*** spoilers ***<br /><br />A drug dealer with a Mexican drug lord on the highway in a super car and all that is stopping him is a small-town  sheriff???<br /><br />The filming is good; the acting is reasonable, just the story needs to be better.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is super fun!! Great people to play with and great entertainment! Price is right and I can play on my computer and my Kindle.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|Page turner of course but no great questions, no intrigue, just conspiracy. I'm sure it's all true. Still a hero.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great and the best game ever invented I am happy to of been included in this game as it I  the best that n you for reading this
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Yes I watched this movie,  it was wrote as if a 2 year old decided to direct it.  Boring plot,  boring characters,  not worth even the time or money to rent it.  After a few minutes of watching it,  I stopped,  came back a few times to digest this pos movie since I spent the money on it.  Rent if you like wasting your money and time on something pointless.  End quote.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie is especially good for history buffs. Lincoln has always been my favorite US President. I did research on Lincoln many years ago, while still in middle school and I have ready almost anything I can get my hands on about him. However, I was never completely aware of the actual political battle he would have had to get the 13th Amendment passed. This movie has really made me stop and think about the political battle he went through. It is a very deep and insightful movie. This movie has made me even more grateful and aware of the strength of his character and his perseverance in making all US citizens equal  - which I did not think was possible after all the past studying I have done about him as a person and as a president.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wake up way too early now. Very good game,and has different features than temple run. Spray paint jetpacks,and way more charactars
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A movie with heart. Realistic, yet entertaining portrayal of couple of people trying to make it through life with dignity and find some happiness in the process.
B0091WRCOA|5.0|this is a fantastic movie for young children as well as adults that actually teaches perseverance and how to get past fear.
B00899DR40|3.0|It was okay a lot of the songs were old by the time I decided to purchase. I listen to it when I have nothing else to listen too.
B001V7YJMG|4.0|It is great, just SO great! I love the artistic style and the musical score as well. It has a strong focus on the cinematography, complete with many lingering shots for dramatic effect. I highly suggest anyone to watch it, even if you are not into vampire films. It is rather different from other vampire movies. It is, of course, subtitled and somewhat slow moving, but not to the point of being boring.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|With songs like Solid Ground, It's Not Enough, Cold Day In Hell and Ask Me Yesterday, WOW!<br />This is pure Tom, and is proof of why he has longevity, while others just fade away.<br />You deserve it all Tom, thanks for not quitting on us.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Overrated just another temple run. The trailer was deceptive and played on your imagination. This game is simply a failure. &quot;Official game&quot;? I think not. This game is a joke. Spiderman who is a inferior hero had better game play, and it also had free roam. This game though free is forcing you to spend money. This game is a waste of memory, time and money. I'm angry and disappointed. Gameloft you have failed me once again.
B00CAJDUX8|3.0|I decided to get it because it was cheap and new. All the songs seem to be short and I just didn't like all the songs on there very much. There are probably about 3 that I did like. Will not buy anymore albums from him. I might just purchase the songs I do like.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Easy to use App. App does what it should do. Using it is very intuitive. This one is highly recommended.
1400062756|5.0|It's a great book.I didn't know I was a fix mindset until my professor recommended me read the summarize of the book.I found I was a fix mindset group. I need to put more time to fix it. It Is not hard to understand, but i need to put myself in every situation and think about how i solve it If it is me. It's an excellent book I recommend everyone to read.^~^

0307352153|5.0|Just because extroverts are the majority in the United States does not make them angels and introverts devils. As an adopted only child born/rejected and raised/outcast in the Bible Belt of Middle Tennessee, I felt like the AntiChrist. It was only natural for someone like me to be introverted. I had no siblings to compete or collaborate or have fun with; my adoptive parents were 20 years older than everyone else's parents and never went out. And I was raised in an underpopulated rural area. So how anybody could expect me, an adopted only child cut off and cut out, to be a chit chat chatterboxing social butterfly was beyond me. Well, now that I am older it's not too beyond me: because people don't understand a situation different than their own. And in Tennessee most people come from big, noisy extroverted families because people like to woohoo yeehaw go honky tonkin' and get it on, if you get my drift! That's how I was accidentally born and thrown up for adoption; my introverted birth mother was pressured by her overly religious extroverted mother into socializing and got knocked up and cut me off from my roots! I was already shattered from being adopted and in school I was bullied by extroverts for keeping my head down and being quiet. Oh, I needed to get out more, be more social, speak up more. But here's the kicker. When I did all those things, I still didn't suit extroverts' majesties (for a few years I participated in everything: girls basketball, girl scouts, won art contests, spelling bees, had 6 years perfect attendance, threw parties and slumber parties and gave it my all but I would get taken advantage of). I got out and opened my mouth and I was still made fun of or mocked or received hateful looks or awkward pauses or I was flat out thrown out again. I had to work ten times harder than everybody else to get any kind of affection. And I was exhausted. I already had to deal with the trauma of being adopted and I had a weight issue as well that exercise anddieting didn't cure. These were certainly additional problems, not substitutive. I was depressed and I got quieter and my head got lower, and nobody had any compassion or understanding for me. I was the freak, the weirdo. On a good day I was pitied. My 6-year perfect attendance came to an end and grades fell because I could not change, and everybody expected me to change while they were just fine because they were the majority. Big family bullies and extroverts can be COLD AND MEAN (generally speaking of course). Introverts are only that way when provoked! EXtroverts hung up on EXteriors EXtract the worst from introverts. Despite being well-educated with a Bachelors Degree in English (Magna Cum Laude) and a Master's Degree in Film, I couldn't get a job because apparentlyI didn't know how to talk to people. I was a hard worker and kind and thoughtful with consideration for others, but that didn't matter. Social skills and cold toughness are all it takes to get a job. So while I languish in student loan debt and bankruptcy from a failed online business where I spent 30,000 hours of my life working hard to make it work all for nothing (although I can boast of 100% positive feedback big whoop!), I try to earn my keep my being my elderly adoptive parents' caregiver, lifting them up and down off beds and toilets, feeding them, medicating them, driving them back and forth to the hopsital without any help from anyone,  I watch cold-hearted, gossip-spreading, bullying, judgmental extroverts succeed in life. And, yes, I am bitter, jealous, depressed, fed up and suicidal. NOT FAIR. It's so important that more books like Susan Cain's get out there. Employers need to understand that hardworking introverts are just as vital to the workforce. Stick them in the back to do the computer work, archiving, creative stuff and stick the extroverts at the front desk to do all the talking and sales work, and you will see huge improvements in how everything works in this world...everythingwould go so much more smoothly and the economy would start improving and everybody would be employed....
B00275EHJG|5.0|It's kinda sad to see the gang go, but they do it with a great adventure and humor.  Not all toys are good as you'll see.  It was a great way to say good-bye to these fun toys.  If you liked either of the first two you'll enjoy this one too.
B00B3YLI8U|5.0|How captivating the old novels can be!  This is a great book although rather long.  But the plot grabs you and keeps you coming back to find out how they fare. The characters are wonderful, even the villains. Maybe they are the most interesting characters of all!!  The Audible version is available and also really enjoyable with wonderful acting throughout.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|You need a tool to open this little sharpener's diamond portion.  Either that, or finger-nails of steel.  Tapered diamond ice-pick style sharpener is great for those dulled serrations on knives, and you can still use it for stroking the edge to be sharpened to a razor sharp edge.  The ceramic and carbide &#34;V&#34; sharpeners a best for kitchen or steak knives, or initial sharpening of a badly dulled tools edge.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun for all ages and worth every cent. I love playing it when I'm bored! I am glad this game was invented :)<br />It's flawless!
B0009MAO46|5.0|This is a very funny and great idea.  You see a magical world of toys that are alive with a lot of huge stars.  From Tom Hanks and Tim Allen to Don Rickles.  The whole family can sit and laugh at this movie many times.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|My nephew specifically asked for this movie, so I bought it as a gift for him.  He has probably watched it 10 times already!
B00005JSGK|5.0|Okay, this has been one of my all time, favorite movies. The plot, the adventure, the actors, the animals, the danger, the love story, the color, the music, is all wrapped in one great film. Would love to see it on Blu-Ray and HD!  Even though almost every character is smoking in this film, yeah, in nearly every scene, it is still a great film. Mancini couldn't have done better, as the music is haunting, exciting, dreamy, and alluring. It's a keeper!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|There's truly no way I can say just how much I love this story. I fell for Connor more with each paragraph. The progression of their love story is brilliant.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|I gave this movie a 1 star because I couldn't give it a 0. My kids are middle school age and this movie was traumatic !! We didn't get past the boat ride after the ship sank with the family members on it because the hyena was graphically attacking & killed the animals on the boat the boy had grown up taking care of ! Apparently it continually gets worse.If you have children who are sensitive, with big hearts and love animals or who are just kind- do not let them watch this movie !! I can not believe the positive ratings this movie has. The very beginning is beautiful but it turns violent and innapropriate very quickly. Should NOT be rated PG. Glad I did not purchase this as I would have thrown it out !!!!!!!!!!!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|absolutely the best commercial show on TV today...the writing is superb...the acting is excellent...and the production is way above par!  just love the show...

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I got this app because one of my friends had it.  I started reading, and it turns out that you can only highlight verses and bookmark pages after you sign in to you Facebook account. And because I am old school, and don't have a Facebook account, I am not allowed to do anything other than read. Do not get this app, if you don't have a Facebook account. If you do, this is a great bible.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a great book and very descriptive. It takes you through the storyline you were right there. This guy was a survivor an  his story should be read By everyone
006224454X|3.0|At the very beginning of this book the main character is horrified by the wrinkles, sagging, ect on her face and body.  Then you find out she's 47 years old!  Throughout the book she is continually shocked, repulsed and horrified by how \\"old\\" she looks.  I'm 49 and no one I know would ever dream of having thoughts like this at our age. It tells me that the male author is totally out of touch with women.  While the story was interesting, this, along with the portrayal of the protaganist as the endless victim left me with a bad taste in my mouth.... namely that of misogyny.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Works great! no problems with it. Everyone should have this movie and I look forward to the next two movies.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|This alarm lets you use music from your phone/tablet to wake you, with the option to have it start very quietly and gradually crescendo until it is loud enough to make sure you wake up .... I love having my latest favorite song gently creep into my dreams and bring me into the day, instead of some squawking or blaring alarm  (okay, I use my phone's alarm as a back-up, but have never needed it!).

1600597963|5.0|Being fairly new to bead embroidery, I found this book excellent. Instructions are very clear, and the pictures are great.  Her books are a must have addition to the library of a person who is just starting out. I have no bead shops or instructors close at hand, and depend on the books available that I can read, and learn from. I bought both her books, and so happy I did. I have completed 2 cabochons since I received the books.  I was having trouble figuring out how to finish off the backs, and this book showed me how.<br />  I can't say enough good things about this book . It's just so great. Thank you Jamie for your beautiful work, and for helping in my knowledge in the art of embroidered cabochons.
159562015X|5.0|This book is an excellent book. It contains a survey done by Gallup organization which gives accurate results on your strengths. I would recommend this book to people who are not aware of their potential. Thank you. Good read.

0812993845|4.0|For this reader, I can almost never go wrong with a Sophie Kinsella novel. I've loved her since the first Shopaholic book came out. She makes me laugh and shake my head at the characters she writes. In Wedding Night we are introduced to dreamy and romantic Lottie, who is sure her boyfriend of 3 years is about to propose to her. I think you know it doesn't go as planned. This launches her into a spiral of emotions and irrational behavior. Luckily for us the reader, we can get a few good laughs because of her antics. Enter Fliss, Lottie's older sister and a bit bitter due to her impending divorce from a scoundrel of a husband. She's trying to balance work and a young son plus now she's got to manage Lottie. It's not easy and you can tell that she needs a release. Enter Lorcan.<br /><br />As in all of Ms. Kinsella's novels hilarity ensues. I couldn't help but seriously laugh at some of the things that happen to Ben and Lottie. It would be enough to make anyone a little mad and a bit crazy.<br /><br />What I loved about this novel was the sister aspect of it. How different Fliss and Lottie were but how they truly cared and loved each other. As an older sister I related to Fliss but admired Lottie's spontaneous personality.<br /><br />If you've never read Ms. Kinsella's books( why?!), Wedding Night wouldn't be a bad place to start. Although I recommend having a chunk of time so you can read it cover to cover.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have just started using Facebook a bit more.  I downloaded two different versions trying to get one where I could play one of Facebook's stupid games.  I got the game downloaded on my iPhone fine, but I cannot get the same game to work on either of the Kindle Facebook applications I tried. This application was worse than the one the other one I downloaded.  It was a waste of my time and energy.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I fell asleep, but my husband stayed up and watched this movie.<br /><br />He told me this morning, \\"I want to watch it again.  It's really great.\\"<br /><br />Now, the reason this is worth writing a review about, my husband does not ever watch movies.  Especially, twice!!  LOL!<br /><br />So, with that, I love this film, even not having seen it yet.  If my husband likes it, then you know it's great.<br /><br />My husband is worse than \\"Mikey\\" (Life cereal), he never likes anything, so I'm really surprised about this and I am going to go and watch this movie now.  Since my husband gave this his thumbs up and 5 stars, that is more than enough for me to love it!!  LOL!<br /><br />Update:  5/10/13<br /><br />I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  I never laughed so hard in I don't know how long.  My husband had more fun watching me watch it, I was laughing so much.<br /><br />It is really a great movie!!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|How anyone gives this a less than five star review blows my mind. This is the greatest Batman story ever told! It has every element that makes Batman great. So great that most of the Dark Knight trilogy was inspired by it. Some lines word for word. But this is so much more! First of all getting Petter Weller voice cast for an aging Batman was genius. Not just because the voice fits but he was Robocop and Frank Miller has close connections with Robocop having wrote Robocop 2 and 3 and writing the Robocop comic series. There's also Robocop easter eggs as well as 1989 Batman easter eggs. The music is so cool with that 80's futuristic sound. Again the music resembles the style of Robocop's. This movie has excellent rewatch value. This movie IS Batman!!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|In this series the FBI is tracking a manson-esque cult whose members are devoted to the themes and rituals extracted from the work of Edgar Allen Poe.  Kevin Bacon is a retired FBI agent who is reactivated due to his expertise in nabbing the cult leader in the first place (not super original at this part, but still fun).  The show excels in myriad ways mostly revolving around a not-so-difficult-to-understand plot as well as the excitement inevitably born from a story line invested in what the cult and its leader are going to plan to do next and how Ryan Hardy (Bacon) is going to stop them.  Most episodes end in massive cliff-hangers and leave the viewer with one thing on his or her mind: &#34;When is the next episode available...?&#34;
B0084670FU|3.0|The movie was hard to follow, I was half way through the movie before I figured out the connections between the 3 story lines.  It just kept jumping back and forth between the 3 locations and was confusing.<br /><br />I am glad I watch it on the Kindle because I certainly would not have liked spending a lot of money in the theater to see it.

B00AZNEW5G|2.0|I was really looking forward to watching this film. All the hype I'd heard put it at the top of my 'to watch' list. Although the outcome is a foregone conclusion, it did well in building up to the climactic moment. Then.....a mega-fizzle. The squad that attacked the compound had absolutely no character development so there wasn't much tension in what might happen to each individual.  Even worse was that the attack was shot in almost total darkness where you couldn't even tell what was going on. My wife and I kept looking at each other and asking &#34;What's happening?&#34; and both of us could only shrug our shoulders. It wasn't until we watched the special features that there is a clear explanation of what happened during the attack and oddly, that made the filming of the attack even more frustrating.<br /><br />I started off giving this film three stars, but as I was writing I began feeling the real frustration I had with this film and dropped it to two.  It leaves that bad a taste.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Good read. Characters are easy to like and interesting. The plot keeps you curious. Lots of intrigue and makes you think about how secure or insecure we truly are.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Interesting plot lines and diverse characters make this one of televisions better offerings. This show is also a great reason to go with Amazon Prime. No ads and no additional fees leaves us open to having &#34;The Good Wife&#34; marathons.  Can't help but devour each episode, but dreading coming to the end of it at the same time!

B00CL0J99K|5.0|After going to see \\"Iron Man 3\\" in 3D today I have to say that for a 2 hour and 20 minute movie it went by fast cause it was action packed and full of laughs and kept you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This movie is a movie where Tony Stark is on his own, there is no Captain America,Thor or S.H.I.E.L.D. to help him out this time. The fun part of this movie is the fact that it does link up the 1st \\"Iron Man\\" movie and you do see what the effects that the \\"Battle of New York\\" from \\"The Avengers\\" had on Tony Stark. It was great seeing Jon Favreau's character \\"Happy Hogan\\" having a cool part in the movie and seeing Gwyneth Paltrow's \\"Pepper Potts\\" not play the typical \\" Damsel in Distress\\" was great.  Don Cheadle as \\"Rhody\\" was a bigger part of this movie and did a really great job. All in all, everyone played their part and made a really great film that I highly recommend and that I hope to own and add to my 3D blu ray collection.<br /><br />\\"Phase 2\\" is definitely going to be the next stage in excellence from Marvel Studios.

B000ID37RM|5.0|My husband and I watch “To Kill a Mockingbird” at least once a year, so in the interest of full disclosure, I am not reviewing a movie I just saw for the first time (even though I am responding to Amazon’s request that I review my most recent watching of it via Amazon Prime last week). This movie is the “Benchmark” for the definition of “Five Stars” in my book.  As some pundit once said, it is the “which” than which there is nothing “whicher.”  I need fingers and also toes of more than just me to count the number of times I have seen this movie since the first time I watched it when I was in fourth grade in the late 1960s, and my whole family sat riveted, huddled under wool blankets, on our unheated, glassed-in porch that doubled as a TV room in those days.  Even as a fourth-grader, I knew this movie would change my life after I saw it.  Many decades later, I can tell you that it still changes me every time I watch it. The movie bestows wisdom on so many issues, and you will find yourself noticing events in your own life that mirror those unforgettable teachings.  The character development in this film was unprecedented at the time it was made. And the plot was unprecedented for its time too.  In an era when little girls were being sold “Easy Bake Ovens” and there was no such thing as an “alternative family,” this movie’s protagonist is a tomboy (Scout) in a family headed by a man (Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer), and the children’s best friend is a delicate visiting neighbor modeled on Truman Capote.  I regret that almost all of the publicity about this movie has focused on the race relations aspect, only because it misses so much of what makes this movie great.  Admittedly, like everything about this movie, that aspect is groundbreaking, but it would be shortsighted to assume this is a movie “about race relations.”  The preponderance of the plot goes far beyond. “To Kill a Mockingbird” is equally a movie about how to learn from misguided assumptions, about recognizing love, and about creative survival. I will stake my life and reputation that this is one of the best films ever made and that will ever be made.  Most films made now have “one note” themes.  “To Kill a Mockingbird” covers far more ground.  In this movie, Scout’s learning about the impact of the Great Depression on human dignity is profound: her tempestuous interactions with an impoverished schoolmate whose father pays for his legal obligations to Atticus with bags full of nuts are tangible, and you can almost taste the syrup that her classmate pours over his eggs when he joins them for breakfast one day.  The scene where the children learn that their seemingly dull father is actually an accomplished sharp-shooter—when he kills with one shot a rabid dog threatening the town—is unforgettable. Most people who learn about this movie learn about the race relations story of the trial, and—as important as that is—it missed two thirds of the point of the movie—so I will end this review with a comment about the “Boo Radley” story overlaying the movie.  So as not to spoil the end of the movie for anyone who has not already seen it, let me just say that when the door swings back and it is revealed who “saved” Scout from being attacked, one realizes who the “the mockingbird” really is. No one will watch this movie and not feel changed by it.  Years after you watch it, you might hear the movie theme music and feel moved to tears.  Yes, it’s that good.from misguided assumptions, about recognizing love, and about creative survival.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I actually like that this is detachable.  This does the job, and I love the price.  I don't understand why most cup holders are so expensive.  This does the job, and since the material is soft, and not hard plastic, the drinks actually don't bump up and down, and I don't feel the need to constantly hold my drink down when going over bumps, etc.  Exactly what I was looking for!

B000I186FW|5.0|V for Vendetta is one of those films that transcends its source-material and becomes a truly influential piece of work.  Set in a Fascist Great Britain following the victory of Germany in World War II, it shows the mysterious V (Hugo Weaving) taking revenge on all those government servants and employees who consciously used human beings for experiments, while deliberately creating an epidemic so as to encourage the people to support them.  Among the assorted bad guys he exterminates are Roger Allam as a military leader and media personality (bearing a strong resemblance to the UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage), Sinead Cusack as a crooked scientist and John Hurt as a truly awe-inspiring Big Brother figure.  V is aided in his quest by Evie Rutherford (Natalie Portman), who discovers a lot about herself and her commitment in the process.  With astounding special effects, including a rousing climax when the Houses of Parliament is set on fire - in a deliberate reenactment of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 - V FOR VENDETTA offers a chilling vision of what can happen to so-called 'democracies,' when individuals acquire too much power.  If nothing else, we should aim to retain the capacity to disagree with people, even at the cost of our own lives.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I agree with others. These books were a look into a truly abusive relationship and how SO so many women keep going back for more. My heart goes out to you. God bless us all! Just stay strong, find belief in your self, know that there is help and others like you. Seek a better life. It is possible.<br /><br /> Bottom line:  Unless you are abused, abusive, sex deprived or in sex addicts anonymous, this is very disturbing. I love love love books with sex in it, who doesn't? I feel I would have enjoyed his sad story more, if every other page was not about the sex.<br /><br />Granted it was interesting to learn what was in the \\"red room of pain\\"  and how things unknown, to most, were used. In some (very good) ways, the books reminded me of the love affair I have with my husband of 24 years. And, we still have that delicious edge. We all need our imaginations stimulated. Absolutely!<br /><br />I loved the inner goddess and the subconscious being talked about like \\"in the third person\\", that was fun and funny. I lOVED the emails/blackberry conversations (ingenious) I loved her innocence, his disbelief that he was good and could be loved. It even made me cry several times. And I learned a few interesting things, but i was frustrated with the toooooooo many sex scenes. (Readers imagination needed)<br /><br />I to had a very horrific childhood and through much research, and therapy, etc. I know what kind of damage it can leave on an adult.  ( I was very lucky to have not gone down such a dark path)..I read the first book, because of so many friends an some family recommending it. And not only was i shocked that they read it, but i was even more shocked that they recommended it. My face was as red as hers throughout the entire book. OMG. and to think I recommended it to my overly classy Mother-in-law (before I read it. \\"eek!\\")<br /><br /> Being naughty with the one you love, can be a VERY very good, very fun thing, as long as you have boundaries and RESPECT each other. But, too tooooo much, tooooo much sex, Like they say, Too much of a good thing, makes us bored. ;@)o tooooo much, tooooo much sex, Like they say, Too much of a good thing, makes us bored. ;@)

B009NYF2ES|5.0|One of the great films. A tour de force for Joel Grey as the host (the equivalent of the Moritatensänger in Die Dreigroschenoper or the commenter in Evita) who was never so good before or since. Liza Minnelli had the extremely difficult job of appearing amateurish, even untalented, while still being entertaining, and carried it off with panache. The scene which I find the most meaningful and memorable, though, is the one in the Biergarten where a fresh-faced young man, almost a boy with an angelic face and a lovely high tenor, starts singing and the camera only slowly reveals the swastika on his sleeve. When I taught European history at the University of Vermont I tried to show the students how it was possible for people as obviously evil as the Nazis, with their harshly shrieking Leader, to come to power in a highly cultured nation, the nation of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Heine, Goethe et al. The point, of course, was yes, it could happen here. The internet did not then exist and old films were hard to come by, but I found a clip of Hitlerjugend entering a stadium, led by a boy of maybe ten or eleven banging on a big drum, singing a rousing version of Die Jugend Marchiert. The boys did not look evil, they looked like boy scouts inspired by some cause in which they all believed passionately and sang their hearts out. The class was stunned, they had never seen anything like it, they could easily imagine themselves participating in so stirring an event. That is exactly what Cabaret demonstrates in that outdoor scene as the people of many ages and kinds rise one at a time to join in the song, Tomorrow Belongs to Me - except for one old man who stays seated and whose expression says he has seen it all before and it never turns out well. Highly recommended, though its approach to homosexuality would not today be considered politically correct.

B00AW28HF6|5.0|I started reading this novel late last week and found it hard to put down.  The author draws you in from page one and the well written political thriller plot keeps the story moving.  It is obvious based on the storyline and plot that Gallagher has thoroughly researched the subject matter of the book.  I loved the side trips to different locations throughout the book.  The author did a nice job of weaving these into the story and it was part of what made the book so intriguing and exciting.  The timelines jump around a bit, but I found them to be necessary to follow the flow of the story and they were appropriately placed within the storyline.  With the dates placed at the top of each chapter I found them easy to follow and not a distraction to the story.<br /><br />Gallagher has an obvious talent in writing - with his vivid descriptions, well scripted, fast paced plots.  If you like stories of espionage, romance and action written in the context of a believable plot that could really happen in today's world, I highly recommend this book.  I will most definitely be getting future novels by this author........awesome work.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|Yes, as the producer was an Italian I thought I couldnt make big mistake wasting 20 bucks but alas. This movie could be compared to similar flicks like--Lenin in October or Battleship Potemkin and all three look very artistic and professional till you compare them to reality. Yes, in the movie Lenin in October comrade Lenin is intelligent and thoughtful and this and that and, in short, great leader; now, in reality he was biggest criminal before comrade Hitler and Battleship Potemkin only adding to my point. At one point Battleship was considered on list of best 10 movies of all times, but after 1991 when facts became known he quietly sank and this is how the cookie crumble--by reality. And so is the Salo--facts do not support producer's idea. Avoid.

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Iron man 3 the game was an amazing one. It generally has smooth controls,it can be a little sketchy .Plus there is so many armors to collect it will take awhile to get them all. I generally only have one complaint. Missiles. I think we really need some more time to see the missiles, it may only be me though. Other than that I don't have any more complaints. It is an overall great game. If anything, I say this game should be 4.5 stars not just 4.

B00A3AUGEW|3.0|I REALLY wanted to love this album, but we had to remove it from out playlist because it's too close to Dave Matthews.  It's ridiculous how closely he's imitating DM... right down to his facial expressions and the unique way he holds his guitar.  Being influenced by another artist keeps the industry alive, but straight up copying them?  Pass.  I've never seen anything quite like this before.  It's a bit embarrassing.<br /><br />Once Phillip figures out his own style, he will soar.  Until then, he wil be pleather.<br /><br />It's worth pointing out that I'm not a huge DMB fan... the similarities are just waaaaay to close not to call it out.<br /><br />Now, the real question... how many days will this review sit before BRIANNA comments to tell me I'm wrong?  ;)
B00CIXDEBE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo347Y337ERXQ5A]]FOR ALL PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR LANDLORDS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The role of the Landlord has taken on an important new significance during the current long-term economic downturn so this book fills the gap brilliantly with its superb, yet simple explanations of how the system works.<br /><br />It does advise on how to avoid the pitfalls covering the full life cycle of a tenanted property and will be invaluable for letting agents as well as both landlords and tenants.<br /><br />The author, George Denton-Ashley, has set out practical step by step guides on how to complete 28 forms and how to carry out 37 procedures in relations to the operation of a tenancy. There is minimal jargon throughout and much common sense which will appeal to a wide readership.<br /><br />As many lawyers know from courtroom experience, the law of landlord and tenant may, at first, appear relatively simple and then the case gets bogged down in what can only be described as `legalese' and the multiple referencing to many cases and pieces of legislation when what the landlord wants is his property back.  We believe the structure of this book provides an excellent way forward for the landlord who can separate the wheat from the chaff before the lawyers and judges get their hands on your claim and prevent a re-possession. It is, of course, more than that because it sets out the responsibilities of a landlord in simple and straightforward terms.<br /><br />We have often been asked- why be a landlord? The answer is to be found here because once the obligations of the landlord are properly understood, `Being a Landlord' sets out what the modern practices are requirements are with minimal risk.  There is an accompanying website at `balandlord' dot co dot uk which provides a comprehensive combined resource for the reader together with an ebook facility for those who want one.  Thank you Spiramus, for giving us such a helpful guide and we feel the work helps set the record straight about what a landlord can and cannot do.mus, for giving us such a helpful guide and we feel the work helps set the record straight about what a landlord can and cannot do.

B000002J09|5.0|Classic album, so what can I say ? Bought it for the Stairway to heaven and though that is my favorite track, the album contains more valuable material. A milestone in music, a landmark in pop music history of the 20th century.

B00006LLLN|5.0|This is a legendary recording and ranks at the top. It combines fine musicianship of band members and Alison Krauss into riveting, touching, inspiring songs on two CD's. Her voice is so pure, and the songs deal with a range of love and friendship related themes that seem to come straight from the heart that, combined with the superb band members, it delivers solidly !
B00BF11STU|1.0|I expected much more from this movie. It was very long, slow, and boring. If you like history and really have time to pay attention to a 2 hour long movie then this is the movie for you! I thought this would be action packed and very interesting but it was the total opposite. I kept looking at my phone and kept walking out of my room while to movie was playing because it was so boring! Do not buy this or rent this unless you like very slow movies that are also very long and boring.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Debut album that showcases her beautiful sensitive velvet hush low voice and musicianship ! The music and songs do tempt one to 'come away with (her)' ! She is also a very good pianist, and the songs on the album are pretty consistent in quality, all very good ! I keep coming back to this one, and followed up with other albums as well.

1439193630|5.0|As a what I call a &#34;writer in progress&#34; I've read a few books on writing. The one thing I've noticed about most of these books is the pretentious and repetitious way they are written. They often claim anyone can be a bestselling writer if only they follow certain rules, take writing classes, and &#34;do&#34; as the writer of said book says. It's unfortunate that is the case, because then you have people who believe there is no other way to accomplish their dreams. When they fail they beat themselves up about it.<br /><br />Stephen King though has written a book that brings the craft of writing down from the lofty heights of academia and within reach of the common man/woman who has a reasonable dream of being a writer. I read my first King novel at fourteen and was mesmerized. Over the years he became an influence on my writing in a way I could not fully explain until I read this book.<br /><br />The first half of the book is a grouping of snapshots of King's childhood; moments he believes shaped his craft. In reading this I laughed and even cried because I realized King and I had a connection on a more personal level. The second half is a no nonsense guide to how to improve your writing in his humble opinion. He does so with humor, sarcasm, and straightforward common sense. More a fluid guide than an unbending rule book &#34;On Writing...&#34; gives a fresh perspective on the craft of writing from a successful writer whose roots are firmly imbedded in poverty and determination. King does not portray himself as an academic or flawless. He bears his heart and soul, ugly warts and all.<br /><br />Any writer experienced or otherwise in my humble opinion should read this unique and informative book. Even if you hate King you cannot deny his logic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book.  By the end I felt I had taken a journey with the characters and gained something positive from the experience.  This novel made me laugh, cringe, and cry... I could not ask more from a book.

1400064287|5.0|Why some ideas persist in popular imagination, while other fade away? Why people remember  urban legends while public messages broadcasted by the Governments are forgotten the very next second? Dan and Chip Heath try to answer these questions in their very readable book, \\"Made to Stick\\".<br /><br />This is the most application oriented communication book for message crafting, that I have read in years.<br /><br />Dan and Chip propose that we can learn the art of crafting a message in such a way that it \\"Sticks\\". They profess the framework S.U.C.C.E.S, which means that for a message to be sticky, it needs to follow one or more (the more the better) of the principles of the Framework.<br />The framework at the core of the book<br />SIMPLICITY<br /><br />Strip an idea down to its core. Exclude whatever you can while retaining your essential message. Less is More.<br /><br />  \\"Proverbs are the ideal. The Golden Rule is the ultimate model of simplicity: a one-sentence statement so profound that an individual could spend a lifetime learning to follow it.\\"<br /><br />The authors give an example of how the message of what SouthWest Airlines stand for is encapsulated in one sentence \\"SouthWest is THE low cost air carrier\\"<br />UNEXPECTEDNESS<br /><br />  \\"We need to violate people's expectations. We need to be counterintuitive. E.g. A bag of popcorn is as unhealthy as a whole day's worth of fatty foods\\"<br /><br />CONCRETENESS<br /><br />  \\"Naturally sticky ideas are full of concrete images -- ice-filled bathtubs, apples with razors -- because our brains are wired to remember concrete data. In proverbs, abstract truths are often encoded in concrete language: \\"A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.\\" \\"<br /><br />CREDIBILITY<br /><br />Why will people believe you. Any facts/ figures should relate on human scale for people to remember them.<br />EMOTIONS<br /><br />Your message should arose a powerful emotion in your audience. Be it happiness, fear, disgust, resentment. Authors give example of, teenage smoker who are more likely to act on a anti-smoking campaign out of resentment for big tobacco rather than smoking is unhealthy messages.<br />STORIES<br /><br />  \\"Hearing stories acts as a kind of mental flight simulator, preparing us to respond more quickly and effectively\\".<br /><br />Powerful stories like \\"Aesop Fables\\" and \\"Panchtantra\\" in India imparts worldly wisdom in a sticky manner.<br /><br />The book provides numerous examples of how the messages can be made sticky using a \\"Before\\" and \\"After\\" approach, called clinics. These `clinics' are the heart of the book. The authors pick up a message as crafted originally by a marketer or communicator and then runs it through their `clinic' applying the SUCCES framework. Through the clinics the authors are able to substantiate their premise that crafting sticky messages is not an inherent talent but it can be learned and its a coach able skill.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this app because I can check the weather without turning on the Tv. All of you should get this app. Most of the other weather apps have pop-up advertisement and this one doesn't. I have a kindle and it works fine.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|What defines this as a GREAT movie is part generational, part life experience and part pure emotion which, IMHO, is why there is such a division between those who absolutely love this film (like myself) and those who just don't get it.<br /><br />For folks of my generation, the soundtrack certainly brings back a lot of memories and evokes instant nostalgia for that wonderful era.  The main theme involves a once close-knit group of friends who had shared that pivotal time in their lives when they were young, idealistic and felt they could achieve anything and that they would be part of each others lives forever. But years later they are reunited only to discover how much each of them has changed, for better or worse, and this in turn leads to moments of self-realization, breakthroughs and even self-redemption for some of the characters.  Or at least that is what I took from the film and is part of what, for me, made it so great in that I felt a connection to my own life experiences.<br /><br />Of course not everyone experiences that \\"been there\\" moment and maybe that's why many people don't connect to The Big Chill on a deeper level.  Of course it can still be enjoyed without this connection, because even superficially there's so much THERE.  To begin with, this film has such an INCREDIBLE cast (most at the beginnings of their careers) and there's such great chemistry between them that it is a very palpable part of what pulls it all together.<br /><br />And of course this was filmed back in the day, and this \\"old school\\" style is glaringly different from the great majority of films produced today - no fast paced action scenes, no special effects, jittery cam, no \\"reality\\" drama, not overly sophisticated nor cynical, etc, etc.  As such, in comparison it may seem to move much slower, but then the trade off is great character development, the dialogue is so good, and there are a lot of very interesting story-lines blended together which, unlike the opinions of some \\"critics\\", I find are altogether easy to follow and do make sense in the end (so yeah not sure what some people didn't \\"get\\" at the end, but so it goes ;?).  Some also complain that the ending lacked some overarching moral or that the ending was just too ambiguous. Well in my OP that's real life for you, so good for Lawrence Kasdan that he didn't feel it necessary to tie it up with a big neat bow at the end.<br /><br />Others criticize that the characters are shallow and one-dimensional, or that the plot-lines are over-used. This is silly, IMO, because what they see as stereotypes is due in large part because the elements of this film BECAME the basis for many other films which came after, and so only now seem cliche. To quote some critiques:<br />\\"No previous film so cleverly captured the tenor of the times, intertwining melancholy nostalgia with contemporary concerns ranging from ticking biological clocks to fears of selling out.\\" \\"...what might be happening here is the classic problem of a film that originated a number of cinematic tropes suffering from the success of the very tropes it helped create... that perhaps is part of why it feels so terribly un-enlightening and unoriginal, because its enormous success inspired so many copycats.\\"<br />So to be completely fair you really have to look at this film in the context of when it was made and give this film the respect it is rightfully due.<br /><br /> Is this a film for Baby Boomers and Baby Boomers alone?  Absolutely not!  This movie deals with timeless questions that every generation eventually looks back and asks itself, \\"What did it all mean? Was all this youthful idealism just fashion? And the film's exploration of the deeper issues of friendship, loss and changing values ensures The Big Chill's continuing appeal to all generations.\\"<br /><br />In the end, while I can't criticize others too harshly for \\"not getting it\\", I would simply suggest that watching it a second time with different expectations might helpand I can DEFINITELY add that there's enough complexity running through The Big Chill that successive viewings will reveal much more of the richness that is hidden therein.  And if you still don't get it, well give it time and eventually you just might ;?D

B00BIVN82M|5.0|Well now, let's say it up front and clear: Michael Buble is the master of \\"feel good music\\". Hands down he is the king of happy,and what is wrong with that? I love this CD, and I applaud as Michael deftly balances standards and new music. Some have said he emulates Sinatra to the point of \\"why bother\\" but I vehemently disagree.<br /><br />He does tend to recycle Sinatra/Riddle charts but is that a bad thing? I think not! Unlike many Sinatra wannabes, Michael truly loves and appreciates the music and it is evident in his performance.<br /><br />Do you like feeling good? Are you tired of all the drama the media foists upon you? Do you seek a refuge from the chaos? Then Buble is the place for you. No, he's not breaking new ground,and yes he is walking upon familiar paths but the man has style and uses first class musicians.<br /><br />\\"Something Stupid\\" is a delight and to those who bemoan Witherspoon's monotone singing, may I direct your attention to the original? Nancy, God bless her did not have the best pipes in the biz either so drop your prejudices and go with that song and indeed the entire CD as an escape from stress and a reason to smile.<br /><br />I love this disc!
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I enjoyed the events prior to the storming of the house where Bin Linden was housed.  The tracking of the courier was very interesting.

B000H7J9R6|3.0|The first two films by Brazilian director Walter Salles: (The Motorcycle Diaries and Central Station) are two of my favorites. Although Jennifer Connelly was fine in the lead role, this film just didn't work for me.<br />I recently had major plumbing work on my house, but it didn't come close to the horrors that occurred in Dark Water.<br />I have ordered the next film by Salles, a western named Behind The Sun, but have not seen it yet. It seems to be receiving good reviews so far. I plan to review that one.
B005HSL626|5.0|Really fun game, so much energy, my kids stay so busy playing this game, love the colors and the smaller kids can name most of the fruit, so they learn as they play.
B008602KQI|3.0|A little under powered in the acting department, and of course the inevitable deployment of persons of color to reinforce the nobility of the heroine does get annoying. Or perhaps it's embarrassing. In any case it's a trope which outlived its usefulness years ago.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved playing Solitaire.  My dad taught me how to play when I was much younger.  He used to sit on the living room floor with a deck of cards and play for hours.  I did too until I got my Kindle Fire and now I can play it on there all day!!

B0029LCJJS|3.0|Sex scenes were overdone. Too many sex scenes were very superfluous and added little to the story.  It appeared the sex was added just to titilate viewers. Otherwise, the story line and acting are very interesting and somewhat educational.

1400052181|3.0|I found the beginning captivating, the middle overly scientific and the ending utterly sad.<br /><br />As Skloot's passion turned to an obsession of telling the story of Henrietta Lacks & the immortal HeLa Cells that she left behind,  I learned just as much about racism as I did science. Loved that the scientific parts were written in laymen terms but the main focus seemed to shift as it all quickly turns to the struggles and disabilities of daughter Deborah Lacks.  Having shone a light on the unethical treatment and studies of blacks by medical professions and how shameful it is the Lacks family never benefited from the mass scale of HeLa Cells made it a bitter pill to swallow!  Appreciated the pictures and being able to associate the faces with the names but overall this story could have stood to have been a lot shorter.<br /><br />With all said....If the story goes to movie, I'll be front and center for the highlights.<br /><br />Ebony EyeCU Reading<br />EyeCU Approved

B001DF68MA|5.0|I think this is the greatest idea ever. I get to be active with my little guy and he gets to feel like he's driving! This is so much more fun than getting in the car to go places!<br /><br />Installation is fairly easy.

B00C7JG0KG|3.0|I have not seen this movie, but I have seen the trailer in 3d and it is sick.  I would love to see the movie at home in 3d, BUT!<br /><br />Now, this is only my take on it.  This might be a test to see how people will take to single disc sales.  I mean, the movie doesn't even have a release date yet.<br /><br />If very few or, better yet, NO pre-orders for the 3d are placed, the studio will forget this idea.  As for myself, if a 3d movie doesn't come with a 2d version as well, I WILL NOT BUY IT!  If, by the time the release date gets here and still no 3d-2d combo pack, sorry 'bout that, Disney.<br /><br />Lets see, Blu-ray 2d & DVD combo case $31.49 plus Blu-ray 3d single case $31.49???<br />That's just shy of $63.00 for a three disc combo pack...  I DON'T THINK SO!<br /><br />We have the power of the pocketbook. Let's use it together and win this.<br /><br />This just in...  at least not too long ago!<br /><br />Previously, the studio packaged Blu-ray 3D in with the regular Blu-ray-DVD combo pack. With Oz, buyers of the Blu-ray 3D can still get the 2D version for an additional $5.99, plus shipping and handling.<br /><br />Now, lets see, it is $31.49 for the Blu-ray 3d and another $5.99 + S&H which would bring it to at least $40.00 or more.<br /><br />To me, Disney is still greedy for my taste.  I'll wait till they come out with a true combo pack at a reasonable price.

B005LAIHYU|1.0|This movie was so stupid in so many ways that I don't even know where to start. It's as if the producers and director where on drugs. The movie makes no sense. All it does is jump from one fantastically stupid plot hole to another.  Don't waste you time on this.
B001DMJ9R4|4.0|I would recommend this for sure anyone who likes Avenged Sevenfold. The live DVD is awesome and the CD has some good unreleased material on it a well. Definitely worth the money.

B0035YDM4Y|5.0|This was possibly the best war novel I have ever read! Marcus Luttrell was a true survivor and what he went through would have killed many, many people. However, he never gave up and I was so impressed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed it. I thought it was well written. Gives you an insight to the person who wrote it and helps you feel you are there. It is not overly technical, but does give support to his reasoning. Moving and touching book.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This could have been a good movie. They never really developed a plot. It should have been about the troubles that come up as you get older. Turned out to be a lot of whining and crying. People who can't appreciate the good things in life.<br /><br />And the cursing. I'm not a prude. Strong language in a movie can help add to the story. Here it was just for the shock value.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie for ANYONE. Not even people I don't like.<br /><br />Amazon should have a zero star option.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is so awesome. It's FLIPPIN awesome!!!!!!!!!!! I love iron man and this game is perfect. I totally recommend it to any and every one that love iron man ;)

B00BHU261S|4.0|Watched this after watching HBO's &#34;The Girl&#34;. . .  I recommend watching this first, as it would probably put things more in perspective.<br /><br />Both films are HIGHLY entertaining especially for anyone who appreciates Hitchcock's work (speaking just as much about Alma there).<br /><br />However accurate to true events either of these films may/may not be,  I suppose I have to be a tad disillusioned about the man.  :(  But oh well, such is life!  I will, nonetheless, always be a Hitchcock fan.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|Being a teenager, this book related to my life in many ways. I thought that the characters were well developed and that the letter format influenced the perspective of Charlie in many ways. The lessons learned and battles fought throughout this book are seemingly similar to hardships that we all go through in our adolescent years. That is what made Perks of Being a Wallflower so captivating. This was an excellent novel and I wouldn't mind reading it again and again.
B008846CAC|1.0|When a text has non-text figures which contain text, the zoom feature will enlarge the text portion of a page but not the figure containing text.  If the figure is selected, there is no zoom feature for the figure.  Usually the text in a figure is smaller than the text on the page, so the benefit of having figures is negated.<br /><br />The book itself is not an appropriate resource for anyone but students with little work experience or people who do not already have a combination of college education at the Bachelor's degree level and at least a decade of experience in the workplace.
034580404X|1.0|I never looked at myself as a sex kitten or tiger or anything else. I like sex...a lot...but am I extravagant? I never dreamed so until I started reading about all this *non-stop sex novel*. What?  Okay, okay, there &#34;is&#34; sex in this book. But non-stop? The book I received and read was &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34;. What I got was a teen (mentality and readability) novel with some smattering of sex thrown in and dominance/submission (and misogyny) to add a flair?<br />You have this insecure, just-out-of-college virgin gal (romance novel lovers take note)who falls for (ready for something original?) Mr. Everything-But-Right. He's the epitome of shallowness. He's rich, Bill Gates rich; handsome as any man who's ever stood upright on this planet has ever been or ever will be, and naturally smitten from first look at this poor, insecure girl and guess what? He's a bad boy. Right, a misogynist and as mentally confused about his identity as they come and he likes her. Sound like a great start? Girl meets handsome, rich bad boy, girl falls for same, (of course she can change him, it's so written in all the books!)  and eventually girl cures (? will she ?) boy. Teen romance at its best/worst. This is a good book for young girls who want to lower their standards of self respect and seep into bad boy types who're shallow-but-desirable or for early middle-aged women who're not getting any (good)sex except through novels, in my opinion. I did read it all the way through, however, just to say I had. And goodness knows, the 'reading level' was easy enough. There were typos and it was written in a writing style suitable for ages 12 and up (except for the sex & and there wasn't a non-stop run of it, either...no matter what you hear) I'd be anxious to read the parody that's out, but honestly, I've wasted enough time on it - I have the trilogy (it was a gift) but I won't be reading the other two, I'll be busy shampooing my hair that night......if you get my meaning....

B00A4AI19I|4.0|Collectors who already have Klemperer's iconic 1961 reading of \\"A German Requiem\\" on disc may be pardoned for taking a pass on this new box set. Yes, the price is virtually irresistible, and you do get the fine mid-1950s-era performances of the symphonies, an excellent \\"Tragic Overture\\" from 1957, and a very nice 1962 recording of the \\"Alto Rhapsody\\" with Christa Ludwig. It's easy, however, to get most of this material separately, and what's left hardly represents Klemperer at his best, nor are the rather tired-sounding transfers particularly impressive. (In all fairness, I should add that my benchmarks for this repertory have always been the classic 1960 performances of Bruno Walter (Sony) and Bernard Haitink's '70s-era readings for Philips, now available on Decca).<br /><br />Here's a cursory rundown of what's in the box:<br /><br />\\"Variations on a Theme by Haydn\\" Op. 56a (mono; recorded October 1954) (remastered 1992)<br /><br />This is simply awful! One of the worst \\"Haydn Variations\\" I've ever heard. There are difficulties with intonation; the woodwinds sound harsh and are poorly blended in ensemble. Klemperer's pacing seems oddly indifferent from variation to variation, his approach utterly devoid of pathos or profundity. (To hear a truly great performance, listen either to Walter's 1960 recording with the Columbia Symphony (Sony), Herbert von Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic (DG) or, best of all, Haitink with the Concertgebouw (1973), currently available in a 7-disc Brahms Collector's Edition box from Decca.)<br /><br />Symphony #1 in c minor Op. 68 (October 1956 and March 1957) (remastered 1999)<br /><br />A very fine performance, but EMI's engineers could only do so much with the muddy mid-50s era masters.<br /><br />Symphony #2 in D Major Op. 73 (October 1956) (1999)<br /><br />Klemperer virtually puts us to sleep during the first movement, and fails to rouse us in the finale.<br /><br />Symphony #3 in F Major Op. 90 (March 1957) (1999)<br /><br />This isn't bad at all apart from poor definition in the sound.<br /><br />Symphony #4 in e minor Op. 98 (March 1957) (remastered 1999)<br /><br />An extremely good performance; Klemperer's temperament is very much in sync with the composer's conception of a passionately dynamic \\"absolute\\" music.<br /><br />\\"Academic Festival Overture\\" Op. 80 and \\"Tragic Overture\\" Op. 81 (March 29, 1957) (remastered 1999)<br /><br />These are very serviceable performances, especially of Op. 81. The remastered sound is quite good.<br /><br />Alto Rhapsody Op. 53 (Christa Ludwig; Philharmonia Chorus (men)) (March 1962) (remastered 1999)<br /><br />The men's chorus may have been a bit too closely miced, but the young Christa Ludwig is compelling. The recording reveals Klemperer in his autumnal maturity.<br /><br />\\"Ein Deutsches Requiem\\" (\\"A German Requiem\\") Op. 45 (Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (soprano); Dietrich Fischer Dieskau; Philharmonia Chorus; Philharmonia Orchestra) (March, April, May, 1961) (remastered 1997)<br /><br />Of all Klemperer's definitive recordings, this is probably the greatest; a fortuitous meeting of brilliant musical minds. Fischer-Dieskau is exceptional, and the Philharmonia Chorus matches him admirably. Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, too, is near the top of her form. (She is not a singer I always particularly care for, given a certain harshness in her tone). Klemperer's pacing captures the dramatic sweep and grandeur of Brahms' conception to near perfection. One of the true classics of the stereo age, this transfer, made with the 1997 re-mastering, is not a dramatic improvement over earlier CD issues, but those transfers were already exceptional.<br /><br />In sum, this set is a decidedly mixed bag; nine performances running the gamut from woeful to wonderful; awe-inspiring to merely awful. Recommended only to die-hard Klemperer aficionados who simply must have everything; otherwise, my advice is to seek out a recent re-issue of the \\"German Requiem\\" from 1997 or later, and givethis box set a fairly wide berth.

B003498SDA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of most of Michael Mann's work....Thief, Heat, The Insider, Miami Vice, and now Collateral.  I actually think Tom Cruise is a very talented actor, and Jamie Foxx delivers a nice performance as well.  The film is shot in high definition, and you can really tell it when the downtown LA night line is in the background.  If you're a Michael Mann, crime drama fan, pick this up.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so impressed with how this series is written, it leaves you wanting to watch more. I do wish they would have seasons closer together, I get a little impatient and find myself trying to feel the void with other shows during the break, but non come close to &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;. My son who is 13 even watches it and also is looking forward to the new season! I will also admit there are scenes that the actors and actresses will say something and I do not understand and find myself trying to search the net for the answer like (spoiler alert) when Mary had a &#34;procedure&#34; that would get her pregnant with in six months....what procedure did she have? Still have not figured this one out yet, but again I absolutely love the show and recommend for everyone!

0440241901|3.0|This review, as well as many more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm ([...])<br /><br />My Thoughts:  This was the second time that I read this book.  The first time that I read it (way back in May 2008) I rated it a 4.5/5 stars.  Ya, I loved it and found it hilarious.  This  surprised me because the other two Kinsella books that I had read (including the first Shopaholic book) I didn't love ... at all.<br /><br />So how did I feel about this book the second time around?  Weellll, I liked it but didn't love it.  Perhaps it's because I kind of knew what to expect.  Or it could be that Chick Lit is becoming a genre that I tend to stay away from because I truly think that it's one of the hardest genres to write well -- at least if the author wants to impress me.  Either Chick Lit comes off as clich&eacute;d and silly or, if done well, it can show us a humourous journey as the main character 'finds herself'.  However you look at it this book didn't impress me as much the second time around.<br /><br />I know that one of the things that bothers me with Chick Lit in general is that it usually begins with a clich&eacute;d, dowdy and misunderstood main character who is typically a complete push-over and looking for the perfect man and/or dress size.  Unfortunately Emma is no exception for some of those clich&eacute;s.  She is continually degraded by people around her (especially her cousin) and just takes it for the bulk of the book until she begins to view herself differently.  That's great that she 'finds herself' and 'comes into her own' but until then I wanted to reach into the book and shake some sense into Emma every time she didn't tell her cousin off after one of her negative comments about Emma's love life or career.  Gahhh!  I guess that's just not how I work.  I'd be sitting that cousin down and having a heart to heart.<br /><br />I understand that chick lit is meant to give it's readers a nice, light and enjoyable read and not delve into heavy subjects or spark debates.  I get that.  But for a Chick Lit novel to impress me and keep my attention is quite rare.  The first time I read this book I remember feeling shocked that I enjoyed it so much because I hated Kinsella's first Shopaholic book.  I found 'Can You Keep A Secret?\\" to be quite funny and Emma to be an endearing character.  So you can either chalk this review up to me now being a more seasoned reader (or perhaps jaded) because this review's rating is much lower than my first rating or how masses of other readers feel about the book.<br /><br />While this book did have some funny moments as Emma shares her inner-most secrets with a complete stranger (I even found them funny the second time around) those funny bits unfortunately didn't make up for the overall feel that I got from the book and the unease that I had reading about how Emma was used as a doormat.<br /><br />My Rating: 3/5 starsbates.

B00A8OWOSO|5.0|I could go on, but the themes that would play out through the Coen Bros. best films that follow are all present here—except inside-out. In Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and No Country For Old Men, the protagonists are all people who think they know more than they do, but are undone by the presence of an elemental evil (except in Lebowski, in which the evil is played for laughs). Coen Bros. films are almost always about self-delusions and how they punish the people who revel in them. In Miller's Crossing, Gabriel Byrne's Tom is the proverbial Cassandra, who pretty much always tells the truth but nobody believes him. Everyone else believes what they choose to believe. The theme of evil vs. innocence is here inverted into evil vs. ignorance. I could go on, but I'd have to write a dissertation. Suffice to say that every scene is a gem, and Byrne's performance is stunning. Albert Finney makes a great berk of a mob boss, Jon Polito shows why the Coens kept casting him in other films, and J. E. Freeman's &#34;Dane&#34; is a great villain (with a twist).
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I really liked the uniqueness of this show, and Kevin Bacon is an excellent actor. The suspense is great, although my husband thinks a lot of the twists and turns are convenient. It will definitely stay on my rotation of shows, along with Dexter, Game of Thrones, and the Walking Dead.
B000FC10IO|5.0|This series was incredible. In so many ways it reminds me, in a very good way, of so many of the themes shared with Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series: kids/young adults coming into monumental strength and powers in the course of saving the world, a unique and detailed system of magic and magical creatures, a powerful bond created between the characters and their 'familiars', or animal companions that are a unique emotional aspect.<br /><br />Lots of darkness and sadness but it makes the excitement and drama of the whole thing that much more enjoyable. This series screams to be made into a blockbuster movie series or tv show ala GoT. In fact in many ways it would/could be sold as a cross between GoT and the Walking Dead. The Dead combined with the WW1 era setting of the mundane kingdom create a fantastic contrast and the passages detailing the juxtaposition of the two are some of the best.

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Last month, my mom commented that her grandmother 'hated Lincoln'.  I couldn't imagine how anyone could despise one of our greatest presidents...but after watching this movie, I gained a new appreciation of all the political maneuvering that happened, and the desperation people felt during the civil war.  I was also moved by the great performances of both Tommy Lee Jones and Daniel Day-Lewis  (Sally Field too!).  I could start to fathom how dissidents of the day could actually murder him.<br />I made sure that my kids watched the movie with me and we've had loads of discussions about how politics work and the impact that 'real-time' news has had on our lives and the world in general.<br />There are so many take-aways from this movie....It's not just historical fiction.  (at least partial fiction)
B00AO2TREY|5.0|I absolutely agree with all the other rave reviews  -- Hurts' Exile is a wonderful album, wonderful songs, highly addictive. I too cannot stop listening to this album. Love the lyrics, instrumentation, orchestration, arrangements, vocals, everything.<br /><br />I really like Hurts' first album, Happiness, but Exile just blows me away.<br /><br />The song Exile reminds me of the artistry of Muse and Depeche Mode, but with the new Hurts twist. Then again the song The Crow reminds me of kd Lang.<br /><br />I could go on and on singing the praises of Hurts and Exile.....
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Well written. Jobs proclivity for bare feet, vegan diets and disdain for soap and water does not square with the beautiful, efficient products he inspired and bludgeoned his people to develop. I've never been an Apple user, although I did try the first iPhone when it came out. Lasted two weeks until I returned to my much more productive Microsoft phone..The book is suggested for anyone interested in the evolution  of the personal computer age..

B004UID2LC|3.0|I have a Kindle Fire, and I think this app is a good idea, but only works if it 'wants to'. It glitches here and there, but when it actually works it is great.<br />Sometimes it acts up and goes all weird, until you have to force close it, but overall its a decent app for the good idea put into it.

B000035Z3K|4.0|There are a bunch of vanpire movies but 1931 DRACULA featuring Bela Lugosi as Dracula is surely a must for vampire fans. It was mostly based on theatrical script of the same title and some of the actors in theatrical version also share the same role. This film version is well-organized and each actor and actresses show convincing performance. With limited make-up technology Helen Chandler who was possessed by the power of the count Dracula the vampire shows well the contrast between when she is sane and when she is under the influence. Dwight Frye who also makes brilliant performance at Frankenstein also does great job as Renfield the madman who helps the count Dracula to visit England. The success of this film paved the way for the monster film series Universal Studio churned out later on.<br /><br />Verdict: Standard Vampire film<br />Rating: 85 out of 100 Nice start of Universal Horror series<br />Recommended for: Vampire movie fans and classic horror movies fans

1592537251|4.0|As an architecture student I find it difficult sometimes to tackle on site sketching. Wishing to develop my skills I picked up a number of these types of books to get a feel for what other people do and develop my own style. This book is great in many ways, taking you around the world to different cities, and showing work from a miriod of different sketchers. I especially likes where some sketches told the time it took to create, showing that even seasoned sketchers tend to take a long time to develop a piece. The differing styles created a good range, allowing one to see and decide on which styles appeal most along with different mediums. Although all the art isn't to the same level of expertise, it gives a good overall view of where one can find inspiration and joy in simple things most simply pass by. I do think this book is a little superfluis as the site [...] is an ongoing project, where anyone can add their work for display. This book also does not give intrusion on how to compose good sketches like some other books. I found robert Oliver's &#34;the sketch&#34;, and &#34;the sketch: in color&#34; to be more helpful to my development, but if you are not looking to develop your skills as much as looking at sketches of different cities, this book will be fine, if not I highly reccomend the two books mentioned above. You won't be disappointed whatever choice you make.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Good solid action movie, the hero NEVER takes off his costume, that is something more superhero movies should emulate. Love the slow motion effects.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|The first movie was definitely better. Far more plot, more scares, more everything. This one wasn't a total waste of time though. The main character is just a badass hero, so I thought she was great. The pacing is too fast, to the point of being a little ridiculous at times, and being a short movie just completely worked against this overall. Because of that, there are some things that just don't make any sense unless you're familiar with the games. I'd actually just recommend playing the games instead of watching this- they're a far more immersing, terrifying, and generally enjoyable experience than this movie was.<br />And, is it just me, or was Pyramid Head a lot buffer in this movie than he was in the first one? I guess slinging that huge weapon around and chopping people up all day will do that to a guy...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great account of Dr. Alexander's experience that shows that we are much more than just our short-lived physical beings.  We are spiritual and our spiritual beings are immortal.  Very uplifting book and reconfirmed my faith in a Supreme Being who loves everyone unconditionally!  Another excellent book on this subject is Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences by Jeffrey Long.

B00005JKZ3|4.0|Our family enjoys this movie every time we watch it. MIB I is our favorite but have been faithful to the last.
B001EC2IV2|5.0|The Eraser starring Arnold Swarzzennegger was probably a sleeper, but I really enjoyed the movie and the story line.  Bringing movies to the present, sort of reminds me of Jack Reacher.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|fun game exciting fast paced dont need real money which is great. just wish it was rdj voice graphics are super cool
B008P9M614|5.0|The video and audio quality of the chapters are great. The packaging is simple and space saver. Everything I expected. Hi quality collectible product for a proud House MD fan.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Our family lists this movie as our favorite comedy Christmas favorite. How like so many of us who envision fantastic results but end up with mud in our faces.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I live this game I play it every day and all my friends love it to I like the graphics and the sound effects also how it upgrades to different towns and things it's just amazing I recommend it to each and everyone even my seven year old girl that I babysit likes a lot
B009GX69RK|5.0|I never miss a show! I love the people and the relationships! Love Love Nick and Jess & I so want Schmit and Cici together!!
B000B8L6LI|4.0|The entry level Sharpening set from lansky. It will get virtually any blade sharp, but not RAZOR sharp. The fine stone, is still too aggressive, and does not hone the blade edge smoothly. It will make a very useful utility edge on your knife, and with the medium and coarse stones included, able to repair off bevel or uneven edges, small nicks and bends in your blade. It is useful, and for the price, will give you a long service life (so long as you don't abuse the stones) and for 26.00 USD, it was worth buying....
B00005LOUP|5.0|We used to always watch the animated ...Grinch...but this one has become our family tradition to watch every year before Christmas.
1934030198|5.0|Tons of info here...can skim it or dive deeper. Some pretty heavy stuff if you want it. A must for athletes.
1592332803|5.0|I absolutely love this cookbook.  All the recipes that I have tried have been a hit.  I made the chocolate chip cookies for a cookie contest at my office.  They were the only vegan cookies and they won the top prize!  The lemon squares are my daughter's favorite.  This is my go-to book for desserts.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This CD  really shows what he can do with his future and is a wonderful artist. Could not ask for a better cd.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|I remember watching this when I was a kid. It's fun in it's simplicity and imagination. Syfy was so innocent in those days.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Not quite as good as Lord of the Rings, but a wonderful movie.  Can't wait for number 2 to come out
B006LSZECO|1.0|How this dribble got on the best seller list I will never know.  And, if that isn't bad enough they are going to try and make a movie from it.  Good Luck on that. I just wanted to throw the book in the garbage the second I finished. All through the book you never understand what is motivating the characters and I might add you never do. It is malicious which out explanation and the worst part is there is no END!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is pretty good i love how neat they make it look and even how easy it is to buy stuff or setting. It was fun making my own little ocean so i think kids will love this any age!
B002ECJZ76|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was all about until I sat down and started to watch. Before long I was really into it. I can't say that I've ever seen another Christmas movie like this one! It's an absolutely magical story and if you like 'different' kinds of heart warming movies at Christmastime, get this one. It's really one of a kind. I won't say much about the story because I can't describe it well enough in this length of time. I'm so glad I added this to my Christmas DVDs. I'm going to be watching this throughout the year. It's for adults and children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|How can I repeat what everyone else is saying about this series? I reluctantly started watching Downtown Abbey and was pleasantly surprised! Looking forward to the new season coming out!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Even if you &#34;thought&#34; you knew Steve Jobs, read this book. Isaacson provides wonderful insights on Jobs and a multidimensional look at the man that revolutionized our relationship with technology.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|it's a fun action adventure movie - not too much going on plot wise but none the less a fun movie if you like that sort of thing.
B00CHILW64|5.0|suspenseful and an insight into what all the people of that region went through. I would highly recommend this film
0374533571|3.0|I first saw the movie and then read the novel. The novel, of course, is different from the movie in a lot of ways which is typical of books appropriated for film. This is a light read but also helps one understand how mental illness affects one's personal thought processes. I enjoyed reading this book but it was not earth shattering and a bit over rated (book and movie).
B00846F1YW|5.0|What can I say.  I got this game for my future child but my wife loves it.  I can't keep my phone anymore when we are killing time.  I am allowed to look also so we have fun together.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This is a thorough, unbiased and well researched biography. Jobs was on to principles of success, and a true measure of success, that many who measure only in dollars miss. It would serve business leaders in any industry to read this. It wasn't an accident that Apple grew to the highest valued company. And, in addition to learning much of what worked in Job's style and approach, much of what didn't is also revealed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an awesome game. One of the very best I've ever played. It's difficult but not so that you become discouraged , just makes you want to figure it out all that much more. Please, please release more of this type game. If I could I'd give it ten ********** !!! AWESOME
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Can't wait for the next installment!  This movie was thrilling and moving at the same time.  Didn't read the books but will follow the movie franchise.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Great movie. I watched this as a kid and am so happy that they've come out with a DVD version so I can share it with my son :)
B0071AKB38|5.0|This is an excellent speaker.  It's great to pack when traveling. Simple operation, very small and works well. Battery power lasts a very long time.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I bought this for my wife. Now she will have something to watch when she is home from surgery.  Thanks.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This dvd is my favorite because they have the childerns choir singing with them and its sweet to see their faces as they sing.<br />  it reallt touches my heart.
1433537427|4.0|This Bible is a really good option to carry around to Church or small group studies, or whatever.  The much larger ESV study bible can be too heavy for some folks.  This Bible is constructed very well and it is therefore recommended.
B000K29CEI|5.0|I got this DVD for my niece as I had remembered it being liked when I first watched it years ago.  Well, she loved it and I really enjoyed it the second time around.  Get it for your kids, watch it with them.  Your whole family will love it.
0938045768|5.0|My brother told me about this book.  Don't really buy into the convict part of the book... but the workouts are intense.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|As a fan of the Doctor I was excited to see the series make a come back. I had seen most of the new seasons but not all of season 1. It was certainly a solid start but it get better in the other seasons. It is tricky balance to keep the campiness of the original series including special effects and make it more modern, but season 1 pulls it off.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|this is a very good tv series I would recommend it to everyone just watch it and you will most likely love it to!
B0055SWM08|4.0|The format is simple and the graphics are good, it gets progresivly difficult and lets you start over as many times as you want.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|As good as the series... very helpful in following the story and the different family lines. Please write the other books asap!.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Kids love it. Watch it over and over.  It is a nice change from the normal stuff over and over
B0053O89KG|5.0|we love castle and would recommend it to everyone, it is a very good tv series.we have all the seasons except the new one.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|No longer do you have to deal with just tiles in the gallery app to try an watch video you have manually copied over. Open this app up, tap on the Videos folder, tap list, tap the video you want to watch, tap galley and voile you are watching  your video. It's great.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|this is a well put together movie i love ryan gosling it is a great love story perfect for whole family
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the Jack Reacher we have come to know and love.  I just wish Lee Child would write faster, as I have read them all to date!
B003L77FYS|5.0|this is a great series I would recommend everyone to watch all the seasons of castle it's awesome! we love castle.
B000I14UTS|5.0|This was my first Liza Minnelli movie, and I was not disappointed.  She played a somewhat odd, free spirit who definitely was experienced in using her sexuality to get ahead, yet was naïve (if that is even possible) all at the same time.  Her character was interesting, and the story line was complex.  A must see movie!
B00003CXBH|4.0|thanks to having my hubby to help with understanding it was a good movie...love robert De Niro beautiful scenery a lot of things going on
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|The challenges are right on and I love the different restaurant settings. After completing all restaurants though I wish it could go on or replay some how just quicker and more challenging.
0385341679|5.0|I want to read the next book these fever series are so good I don't want to stop reading them I can't wait till the next books come out.these are a must read series get the fever!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift and my friend was very happy. Blu ray movie was awesome on my home theater
B001EC2ISA|5.0|love michael keaton he plays a great beetlejuice wynonna ryder is a good little goth love different parts of the movie,
0385349831|5.0|I fell in love with this book from the very start. It is so beautiful and so simple and so wise. It is what the bible is about, but in understandable language. I am grateful to have been put on its path. I want to read it again and again.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|we love the castle series we have all the dvd's now except the new season which we have been watching on tv.castle is awesome!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The beginning was a bit iffy - but it got better as it moved along and the dance competition result was laugh-out-loud funny. It had a happy ending, a necessary ingredient for me to enjoy a movie. I could say more, but I don't want to spoil it for you. Remember to not let the beginning make you think twice about following the movie through to the conclusion as it truly is a movie worth watching.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would give it 5 stars but upgrades have added annoying ads.<br />Good game, cards easy to read. Works on phone and tablet.
B000001E7T|5.0|Every album PJ Harvey creates is as unique as she is.  I find this album incredibly sexy. It is raw, emotional, sometimes a little desperate.  C'mon Billy is one I turn to over and over again.  If you don't own this already, buy it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Fast paced, good characters, and only slightly absurd. Def would recommend to mystery lovers and government conspiracy thriller lovers. Good.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|If you are looking for a funny movie. This is not your movie.<br /><br />Although, if you are looking for a good overall movie with funny pieces and low pieces. This is it.<br /><br />You can definitely see why Jennifer Lawrence won the awards she did. Additionally, Bradley Cooper should have also won the Oscar, not DD Lewis.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Iron Man 3 isn't really a third movie, it's a 4th, following directly on from the Avengers. In fact, I'm surprised it has the 3 prefix instead of a subtitle like the other Phase 2 sequels do. Anyway, Tony Stark is still reeling from the Avengers and has spent his time having panic attacks and building a bunch of suits. The U.S. Government is trying to regain face after the attack on New York in Avengers, and so have turned War Machine into Iron Patriot (which did well in the polls) while trying to deal with a new terrifying threat, the Mandarin, a mix between Bin Laden and Genghis Kahn with one hell of an ax to grind against America.<br /><br />Well, basically, there's a MAJOR twist. A film changing twist. One that comic  fans will hate, and people like me who don't mind these sort of changes if they're done well will love. One that no casual audience member is likely to get (though there is an early hint that film students like me should recognize as such). This twist involves the Mandarin, and it results in the biggest real world statement about the effects media has on the way we view terrorism that I've ever seen, as well as resulting in some of the best comedic moments that Marvel has ever had to offer. Don't believe the trailers, this is not The Dark Iron Man Rises, it's more about defining who Iron Man is without the suit through both serious scenes and comedy. This film is excellent, and exactly what Marvel should aim for moving forward. In my opinion, it matches Iron Man 1 for the best Marvel film except Avengers. If Marvel keeps doing unique, high quality, exciting, and original films such as this, then people won't get sick of superheroes and we might just see Kevin Feiges dream of James Bonding the Marvel Cinematic Universe happen. Warner Brothers, you have a lot to catch up with.<br /><br />9.8/10
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I use the alarm everyday! Never late, never missed an appointment. I have tried other apps,  but this has worked best.
B00AO2ZMB6|5.0|Dutch and Claudette, Vic and Shane, Julien and Dani, you won't find another cop show as dynamic as this one. The whole Kafka-esque metamorphosis of this seven season show is NOT something that I'm willing to spoil<br /><br />If this show is the ONLY reason to blow your 1yr $80 Amazon Prime fee for, it's MORE than worth it. The last quarter hour culmination is worth EVERY LAST M I N U T E of the seven season long story.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|If you want to be swept away into a fantastical world of logical magic and reason ; along with romamance and adventure , then this is the book for you.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Hi, Steven! Remember me?? You BET I pre-ordered this album! \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" are probably two of the best songs Aerosmith has ever played. Keep up the good work and go on tour!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perfectly perfect perfection that is just perfect and beautifully amazingly extremely perfect that I can't even believe how perfectly perfect it is.
B00BU18U82|4.0|great game but it REALLY needs animals and a semi to haul your grain places easyer but other than that you can buy tractors and farm the land
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I was so excited to be able to download and play this game on my kindle....one major problem... The sound effects on this version suck and are not what they are when I play this game on my PC on facebook. I literally have to turn it off cuz it gives me a headache. I thought maybe it might have been an issue with downloading but uninstalled and reinstalled did not work. My husband downloaded it on his kindle as well and the same thing happened. Fix it please because I really like this game.........
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|We hosted Christmas at my house this past year, and everyone enjoyed this subtly beautiful holiday music. Perfect for James Taylor fans, or a hostess gift, if you're attending a holiday party...
B005LAIHRC|5.0|love it got it fast  well done not a fan of toms but loved him in the movie so had to have it
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Okay - Isn't good enough?  Im not a movie critic you know?  I like AMAZON  but I DO NOT like being told I HAVE To write a review summary for every movie rented.  I'm happy to rate the 1 to 5 stars, BUT I will just delete your inquiries if that's not good enough for Y'all.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Everything without free roam the game is great and you will love the suits there are some many I don't even know about.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good read<br />I enjoyed the whole book could not put it down wonderful love story with a lot of passion.  Kept me on edge the whole time
B003M6FGTE|5.0|This is just such a fun program. While I don't approve of some things that teens think are acceptable today I find the program relatable but music is terrific!!
0439023513|4.0|priced well, shipped quickly, and enjoyable reading.  This finished my reading of the trilogy.  The boks are quickly read and tell a different story.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|My son mentioned this, and I was, for once, able to surprise him.  He loves this movie.  Very funny remake.
B009JZPH32|3.0|But the scene steaing belongs to Benicio. An absolutely mesmerizing performance. Nasty, nasty. The poor ending of the book is replicated and then changed, not for the better. But nice to look at.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|If I had an always on internet connection, this would be a great missing link between my home computer and my tablet and phone. As for my current online situation though, this is not always the case. However, it makes for a nifty way to control my laptop when I have it hooked up to my TV without having to walk over and type in things I want to write (like this). So top marks for that!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Excellent product, but wish case was different type of material. Can charge phone very fast.  May get a second one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app helps to keep informed about my kindle and how much time I have left to read or ot play<br /> as well as how mucbh time to recharge
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|But watch for the entertainment. A comic book approach. Two machine guns being fired at the same time by one guy. (Where Eagles Dare?) Some good actors playing, is always worth a watch. But please no more badge throwing.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Just like Diablo. Very fun and engaging the timer for upgrades and such isn't too bad just gives you time to do other things
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Far better than the already great original.  Runs great on my GS2 and GS3.  No crashing, just good old running fun.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are the best books. Mockingjay is my favorite. They all tug at your heart strings and fill your body with emotions. Thank You Suzanne Collins for letting me slip into the world of Panem each and everyday!
B005LAIIKI|3.0|but still Quentin recycles other ideas. And here the Western has been twisted through Italy and Spain and emerges as less. And comic book. And here come more ninja on the balcony, oops, wrong movie, but that scene is still there. Some good acting makes it watchable, but certainly light weight.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I liked how the book kept you on your toes but the emotions were very hard to follow. I would suggest it be read by anyone who loved the selection.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book has wonderful character development.  I loved that the plot was not predictable and kept me guessing.  I downloaded the second book immediately when I finished this book.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I love karate movies my favorites were Bruce Lee Jet Li and now IP MAN I love all--I wish I can buy all karate movies
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Good book. Reminds us of the dynamics of the silicon valley. A genius in our midst but not a &#34;nice&#34; guy.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Considering how awesome the effects are it's unbelievable how the storyline of this movie makes it basically unwatchable.  Megan Fox may not be the best actress out there but her replacement for this movie makes her out to be an Oscar winner for sure.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I use this calendar daily. I use it more than daily. It integrates perfectly with my Android device, updates perfectly from Google Calendar on the web, integrates others' scheduling opportunities into mine and makes my life livable.<br />If it ain't written on my calendar I don't do it, so this is the most important app in the universe for me. This particular one is the best you're going to find. It is completely customizable and easy to use.<br />'Nuff said.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! It is truley fun!!! If u r on a long trip this game will satisfy your gaming wish!!!!!!!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Another book that has a lesson. The person that wrote this must have had an insight into the mind of a person that was slightly off. Very entertaining and hard to put down. Now I have to see the movie.
B0022F1XW0|3.0|I must say, I thought Genesis had a lot more hits than this, Unless they're all just Phil Collins songs that I like. But lucky for me I bought Phil Collins greatest hits also. The Import one, So I'll give Genesis a few more listens to along with my new Phil Collins disc, burn it, and I'll report later. It's all just personal preference. But the disk were brand-new and in great shape, Thank you Amazon.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I decided to watch this show because all the shows I normally watch were on hiatus and I was bored. I'd heard it was good, and like comic book based stuff so I figured it was worth a try. Honestly I expected it to be terrible. I was pleasantly surprised. It is a good show with lots of action and the acting is actually pretty good (unlike some others in the genre.)  While I still wouldn't consider it one of the best I've seen, it is pretty good and I do enjoy watching it. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it enough to download several other episodes and plan to continue watching it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just like &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo&#34; trilogy, these books are just hard to put down.  The writing style is more geared toward younger readers.  Suzanne Collins is not J.K. Rollings but she tells good stories.
6305781427|5.0|Some of Yanni's most stirring music performed in one the most magnificent settings in the world - the ancient Acropolis of Athens in Greece.  This show is best viewed in a darkened room as the perfection of the evening seems to emanate from the screen.  It's not hard to imagine yourself sitting among the audience, especially with an adequate (or better) sound system to convey the music.<br /><br />The orchestration and featured individual performances give the songs a majestic quality often lost on regular CD releases.  A good example is the rendition of 'Aria'.  Although this is a very good number in its original composition from the &#34;Dare to Dream&#34; album, the concert version adds horn flourishes and additional orchestration that elevates it to one of the best pieces in a lineup of extraordinary music.<br /><br />While this music is eminently enjoyable listening to the audio alone, the addition of video will take your enjoyment of it to the next level.  If you are a Yanni fan of any degree, this DVD, as well as the Tribute concert DVD (which is even better in some ways), is an essential addition to your collection.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|This is a very good movie about the times of Abe Lincoln.  It takes you back to the day of the events.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I love this movie.  The acting is so very good,...and the emotions brought out are many.  The story line is, of course, simple.... a man who claims to be Kris Kringle... Santa.  This movie was made a long time ago, before 'political correctness' of the ignorant and character-less world of today evolved to what it is.  Had the movie been made today, Kris would have had to take the verbal abuse of the idiot 'psychiatrist' working at the major departments store, and Kris would have been relegated back to the 'home' from which he came.  And the judge would never have allowed the issue involving 'Santa' come to court.
B0084670FU|2.0|It was hard to make it all the way through the movie. The nudity was totally unnecessary and probably pushed it from a pg13 to an R rating.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone for any reason unless they were looking for bad movies to review.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Wicked game, been playing for 4 years x colourful, entertaining, with the different levels and bonuses making it fun to play x
B000E1YVZU|5.0|What can I say?  This is a classic that everyone should watch at least once.in their life.  A must own.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This movie has superb acting,...a highly emotional story line,...from love to hate, from laughter to tears.,....but so awesome.  It is a story of giving up, ...of becoming overwhelmed by life such that a person wants no more of it,....especially when they don't see how their life has been so important to others.  But then, due to God's intervention and the love and respect of others, a call to 'come back' and realize just how valuable you are to so many.  Jimmy Stewart's most excellent work.  You'll love this movie.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I resent having to have a facebook page to play it.  I have already deleted it from my kindle fir
B00280LYIC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It reads quickly and stays focused on the main story which makes the pace fast and gripping. Even though I read it  for myself I could see reading it with my son (4 years old) as he gets bigger. Downloading book 2 immediately, given the low price (less than $5), it seems like a good deal to stay entertained this summer.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|I loved the movie but during the first hour movie quit and it would start reloading. Each time it did this it would take up to 10 minutes to reload.  It was very distracfting and annoying.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series.  I can't wait every evening to watch an episode.  I love it thankfully my life has much less drama in it.
0812993845|4.0|This is another great book by Kinsella, a perfect beach read that will make you laugh!  I highly recommend it!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Getting used to MS as the Doctor is taking some getting used to. DT was such a great Doctor that his shoes are big ones to fill.  The stories in season 5 lacked the excitement of past seasons but I was glad to see how everything tied together in the end.  I am starting Season 6 tonight and am looking forward to more of the best sci-fi on tv.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Ken Follett could write a book of 2000 pages and reading it would still be a breeze.<br />He's as entertaining an author as writer can possibly be.<br />On starting I was afraid I would not recall the characters well enough from Book 1 as it seems as though it was purchased years ago, but it all fell into place in the briefest of time.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really like this book.  It started out a bit slow, but as I read further, I really started to wonder what was going to happen and kept on turning pages!  Good sign of a good book.
B00CMOGHMM|5.0|I used to think \\"Frasier\\" had the most consistently clever (and intelligent!) writing ever.  They were great, but have been surpassed by TBBT.  Every episode has me (and my son) laughing outloud.  LOVED Bob Newhart in \\"The Proton Resurgence!\\"  He has such an amazingly dry comic delivery and timing, he fit in perfectly!  My ONLY complaint about the show is that they have, on many occasions, had Penny appear as a sort of drunken slut who sleeps with every guy she goes out with.  That's one reason I love when Penny is with Leonard.  But she still almost always has a glass of wine in her hand.  Oh!  I do have to single out my all-time favorite scene.  At the end of the Season 2 episode, \\"The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis,\\" when Sheldon opens his gift from Penny:  a napkin autographed by Leonard Nimoy.  Best line ever:  \\"Do you realize what this means??  All I need is a healthy ovum, and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!!!!\\"  That is just classic!  It just doesn't get any better than that!<br />Please... DON'T EVER GO OFF THE AIR!!!!
B000PMG16U|4.0|I believe that if you purchase a premium HD product, it should stand out for ease of use and convenience. Too many legal bumpers at the start of these movies makes viewing irksome at first. And you can't skip over them. It's okay for the incipid lawyers to demand mandatory viewing, but for such a premium product, I would expect (1) to have a choice to skip bumpers.<br /><br />Also, I believe that for the purchase, a digital copy would be made available. In this day and age, it's inconceivable that one could not be made available to LEGITIMATE BUYERS.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|It's taken a long time, but finally we have the completion of a saga.<br />Not quite up to the standard of earlier works but Sanderson does his best.<br />Rand's final confrontation seems overly gentle and rather predictable when compared to the travails of heroic figures like Lan and Perrin
B0052RDHTM|4.0|An epic story filled with exciting scenes--at home, on the battlefield, on the streets, and in political venues. The characters are intriguing, the star being the First World War itself. The reader is pulled into a journey filled with interesting facts and characters and places, and the 1910s and 1920s come alive on the pages.<br /><br />There are a few too many racy sexual scenes that could have been left out however.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love being able to get weather updates any time any where. Up to the minute radar for the area I am in is great.
B008M721MS|1.0|It says for the kindle, but it never downloaded onto it. And I don't understand how I can get it.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|You never know where the movie is going to take you. With different situations going on all the time. Love the dancing ~ excellent!! There was some time spent in getting those scenes down. A movie that takes a person back to the era when vacations where the entire family was involved and could be taken within the financial means.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|At this writing, the season is not yet done but for me it has been a great ride so far. I like the slow and subtle pacing, the fact that they are taking their time to spin us a great yarn and are not relying on cheap tricks or thrills to get us there. Hopefully it will be renewed for a second season that we can all enjoy.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love, love this game. Can wile away hours playing it. Love the ability to play, read books surf web, etc. anywhere I have to wait.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|honestly i find this version easier than the first. i couldn't even run 1000 meters in the first addition and now its like i dominate. its too fun to put down sometimes.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Only read the first book so far, but as soon as I got my Kindle, I purchased the Trilogy - the first book was fabulous.  Cant wait to get into the next two.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I had not seen Jennifer Lawrence in anything before, so was pleasantly surprised to see what a great actress she was. Very good movie! Who says movies without all the crap can't be great??
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is a terrific DVD which anyone can enjoy. You do not need to be a Stones fan. It is fascinating to see how relaxed Muddy Waters is and how the Stones are simply in awe of him. Well worth getting.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game finally came out on kindle it is so forsaken awesome u should get it it's completely free and has zero bugs sweet
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and I could play it all day. Even if I lose or win then I never give up.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Everytime I start the game it opens a fake welcome screen.  The game is decently fun but I am not far in yet.  Again, I hate the fake welcome screen before the daily free gold.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Poignant! Very inspiring! I think as women we forget or don't know it's ok to succeed ! This book reminds you!
0439023513|5.0|my daughter loved this book great for all age groups a very reasonable price for a great read at bedtime
B005MRXS78|4.0|Works great and simple learn/setup. Does all as advertised. Would purchase again and recommend to friends. Best choice of others available.
000744785X|5.0|This is a rare book elevating the fantasy genre, but not for children, depending where you put the limit, some of the heroes (or foes) are teenagers, in their early teens. The imaginary continent of Westeros has to be a little known when you read this book, the content is dense with hundreds of characters and extra, a Middle Age in a fantasy world without firearms, but not an American dream and more sad endings than happy ones at this moment of the tales of G. Martin.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|What an informative movie concerning the horses role in WW1.  The relationship and love between the horse and his owner/friend was portrayed brilliantly.  This is a movie that will keep you in tears and keep you enthralled.  Do buy this movie for your collection!
B001NZB5GO|3.0|A classic sad film many stars in it.  A romance starts but sadly he dies.  Set in Berlin before the war.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so cool now that it is Tokyo I love it so much I would marry it so get this game.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Well done film true story very touching make you cry.  I recommmrnd it highly. The actors do good the oldest son is very good.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|It was just liked I imagined it would be it was drama romance and action into one with a little comedy
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|This is a good show. Never a dull moment. My only critique, is that sometimes they dumb things down, or have characters do stupid things in order to move the story along.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The book continued right on without too much repetition. Characters are well developed and the antagonists are truly evil. good read.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I think it is a good game but I have a problem. I started playing after I downloading but then now I cant. every time I open it it only gets me to the marval, then it exits the game
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Anyone who loved firefly will like this movie. If they had to cancel firefly, then I'm glad Joss Whedon was able to wrap things up better.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I love this show!! One of the best shows on TV. Cant wait to see it every week. Can't wait till it comes out on dvd, so I can watch it again
B00005JLEX|5.0|even though this was used, it was in great shape. I don't usually buy tv shows and I was surprised it looked almost new
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I REALLY LOVE IT I THINK ITS THE BEST TEMPLE RUN EVER MADE I'M SO HAPPY WITH THIS GAME THAT I WENT I WENT AND  PERCHESTED TEMPLE RUN BRAVE AND TEMPLE RUN OZ IS  OBVIOUSLY THE BEST TEMPLE RUN EVER MADE CANT WAIT FOR WHAT'S  OF NEXT TO COME IN TEMPLE RUN HISTORY!!!!!#
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|Bon flipper starwars, ambiance et musique sont là.<br />Seul regret devoir payer pour récupérer des tableaux supplémentaires : seul l'empire contre attaque est dispo lors de l'achat initial...<br />il faut repasser à la caisse pour récupérer clone wars et boba fett, cela deviens une constante chez les éditeurs de mettre des micro paiements supplémentaires.<br />Enfin le temps de faire le tour de l'empire contre attaque promet déjà pas mal d'heures de jeu et le tarif n'est pas non plus excessif avec des scènes qui se débloquent au fur et à mesure qu'on progresse en score et envoyons la bille aux bons endroits! Très fun!
1451697686|5.0|She makes it seem very doable and without a complete overhaul of your home.  I plan implementing her ideas throughout our house.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|My husband has been looking for this movie since before he and I got married, and it was always the one we couldn't find in a store, and the one that would take a while for a video store to order for some reason. I found it on Amazon, ordered it, and when my husband opened it I think he became the happiest man in town. :D As for the order itself, it was as described, in perfect condition, and arrived barely a week after I ordered it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|My son is really excited to play a game that his parents used to play, but it will not even load.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|If you think for a minute this album is just violin, you are  sorely mistaken. Stirling does an absolutely amazing job of mixing catchy classical violin riffs with pounding beats and electronica sounds. Must own!
B00006BSGZ|5.0|The filmed legacy of Callas is very small considering her ranking in the world of opera.  This disc contains just about all we have of her on camera, performing.  But oh what performances!  The CARMEN excerpts tease us to what a CARMEN she would have been!  Rich lustrous tones, a real understanding of the role. And those eyes...real CARMEN eyes.<br />What can be said of the TOSCA that hasn't been said?  Callas didn't just sing TOSCA, she Was TOSCA!  From her entrance in act 1 to her leap from Castel Sant Angelo in act 3, she was TOSCA.  The act 2 filmed version here lets us not only hear but see what a singing actress she was and is.  Always in character she portrays this tormented woman like no other.  And she has the perfect Scarpia in Tito Gobbi.  He doesn't bluster his way through the role but is very smooth and suave in his lecherous way, squeezing out the information he wants.  Questo en bacio di Tosca, indeed!  It is a kiss from Maria Callas to all of us to remind us of what the greatest opera singer of all time was and is.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Brevity is the hallmark of this third addition to the Jurassic Park series.  (Part three is just a little over 90 minutes.)  The story is compact, involving a rescue mission (yes, another child in jeopardy).  A desperate couple procures the assistance of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), under false pretenses (basically, they kidnap him).  He's under the impression they're on a sightseeing trip over Isla Soma.  Imagine everyone's surprise when they crash.  After that, there's a lot of beasties to contend with, danger lurks everywhere, things don't go as planned, not everyone who stepped foot onto the island makes it back off again.  William H.  Macy is great as the desperate father.  Michael Jeter is fun as the sardonic pilot.  Alessandro Nivola does a good job as Dr. Grant's enthusiastic student with a fondness for eggs.  Laura Dern puts in a brief but important appearance.  The only discordant note comes from Tea Leoni as the missing boy's mother; she is in equal measure shrill and insufferable.  Otherwise, a perfectly acceptable sequel.  Love the new dinosaurs.  Considering the ending, I had great hopes for a fourth installment (that never came).  Oh well.  It's never too late...................
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really enjoy this series. I love the characters and the world she has created.  If really recommend these books for a fun and easy read!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Ordered this based on a friend's recommendation.  Played soon after getting it - easy to learn, fun to play and changes each time you play,  Love this game looking forward t playing the extended version soon!
0385394233|1.0|I hated this book.  This book does more to set back the case for treating women equal in society and in the workplace more than any other book I've read.<br />First of all, she complains that historically, women have left the workplace after having children.  Hello!  It's called birth control and it wasn't readily available or truly effective when our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers were of childbearing age!<br />Next, she ignores the fact that having children and utilizing the family leave act still delays reviews and pay raises equivalent to the time you are out of work.  If you take two or three months to stay  home after having a baby, your pay review is delayed two or three months.  If you have a couple of children over five years, this places you permanently behind your co-workers who did not take time off.<br />And she complains about having to breastfeed children.  Like it is a burden.<br />Lastly, she comments that the ability of women to have children and still pursue a career is dependent upon &#34;affordable&#34; daycare.  That means &#34;cheap&#34; daycare.  So she would have women working at low wages to subsidize the 'more important' career woman. Hypocrite.
B00CEIGYAG|1.0|MP3s should be $1, this will probably be the last one i buy at this rate. These artists need to focus more on selling albums than trying to get more pennies off of one or two songs.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I just couldn't stop reading once I started  I had to find out how it ended and I wasn't disappointed. I can't wait to read her next book.  Great mystery. Would recommend it
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I loved this movie!  The acting was amazing and so raw.  Really pulled me in I didn't want it to end.  I bought it so I can watch it again.
0395631246|5.0|This book is very well written and it is loaded with very important contracting concepts and loaded with techniques to manage those concepts.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved this game. I actually hid my eyes a couple of times!  Keep creating these games so I can keep playing them.tv
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|We are Star Trek fans, from way back when the original series aired.  We own the original series, the Next Generation series and all the movies on DVD.  We are enjoying Deep Space Nine on Amazon Prime Instant View.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is guite fun and I think all ages can play it. Little ones can adore the fish and older people can use their creativity.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Yes. Yes, double yes. No other show exudes the charm and downright original humor that this show contains. Yet as with most things that are unique and genius in the twenty-first century, it is largely ignored in favor of the more dimwitted and crass humor that unfortunately pervades contemporary television comedy. Regardless, if you are looking for a show that restores hope to television's (and NBC's) future, it is Community.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Didn't get hooked on Friends till it was in reruns.... I believe it is an awesome series.  Love all the characters, but especially Ross and the three ladies.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I try to click on it to play it but it doesn't open for me, o really like this game but it frustrates me
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|What a godless waste of time.  Wanna learn how to be gently lowered into the warm waters of death in a godless universe?  Watch this crappy movie.  Everyone dies.
B006PW0F52|5.0|I love Ariely's books. Unexpected insights into how we are and why.  Ariely's commentary is backed up with empirical evidence which are just as amazing as his ideas.<br /><br />Well worth a read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have gotten a lot of great ideas that I have used love it love it love it - its very useful
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I never read the book, and I didn't get a chance to see the movie in theaters, but watching it on my TV was very entertaining. The cinematography and graphics were great. The story was really good, too. The ending left me wanting a bit more, though, and really made me think and reflect on the story as a whole. Definitely recommend renting it if you haven't seen it before.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it nice game to play - I like the fact it was free  enjoyed it a lot -  played it many times
B004XJNPAQ|4.0|Great premise of a movie. Also good action scenes, cool muscle cars, good story, and all-around good old-fashioned American shoot-em-up scenes. If you like action movies with cool cars, definitely recommend it.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|So glad this DVD was offered....great choices of episodes!  Having some of the best shows on one disc is great!
B005MJFA2W|4.0|If you like thinking then this is the book for you and a must read. This thankfully is not a self help, 'leave your brains at the door' book. Kahneman articulately describes the way we think and how we exchange ideas, opinions, hypotheses and facts with ourselves and with each other. The committee in your head. We then ultimately arrive at some form of conclusion or answer, decision, possible judgement or specific choice on a matter. When does intuition or a gut reaction work? When does it fail? Think fast? Think slow? Knowing what your biases are.<br /><br />Kahneman is a career thinker and his work is evidence-based across a number of different disciplines and fields: this is what makes the book very informative and also very interesting.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game basically a repeat of Temple Run. That doesn't mean it is bad.I would recommend this game to plenty of people. I generally have no problems with it.However, I do think that the stuff in the shop is pretty over priced. But overall very good.
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|I am very disappointed in &#34;Standing Ovation&#34;.  The only enjoyable song is Boyle's rendition of &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34;.  There was not nearly enough harmony with the male voices.
B005FPT51K|4.0|We bought the old version because we couldn't wait for the new one coming up this year. And honestly has become one of the great purchase of the year. I'm outside of the house quite often for work and to be able to see my son and my wife thru the app it's awesome!! I guess the only thing will be that once a month we have to unplugged and plugged again because is unable to connect to wifi.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the second time I've read this and I'd forgotten how much I LIKED it.  Nicholas Sparks has always been a favorite author and he doesn't disappoint with this one.  Can't wait to see if this movie compares.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|So I'm aloud to get any app I want and I don't wanna spend. 6.99 on ANYTHING. Pleease lower the price to. 99 so I can buy it
0783231202|4.0|Quite good - hard to watch parts of it.  This was our second time and my husband wanted to check out JQA's role as the defense atty.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I know some people complain about the 'bait and switch', free games which you have to later buy if you want to finish playing it.  However, I find that I appreciate the chance to start playing before I have to pay for it.  This one, I went ahead and purchased.  It is fun, with an option for hints for those of us who need it.  There are hidden object and other puzzles, but I do wish there were more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Classy yet dramatic series.  If you have time to watch just one show (like I do), make it Downton Abbey.<br /><br />Of the 3 seasons, I must add that my favorite has been Season 2.  But I'm still a fan of the show.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|If your mom said. you can get it you going to have a blast.I'm having fun and my cousin is havingfun to.
0765342294|2.0|Curled corners  and bent cover with wrinkles on the front AND the back cover with  a slight tear in one corner. Curled pages  with wrinkled corners mostly in the back of the book. If you put the spin of this book in your hand and take a look ,  it wants to open in the front  , and in the back  , and it is Obvious  that this book has been read through and through.  False advertising this as a new book that has Never been opened is bad for business.  What’s my fault is that I should have never bought from someone with only a 52 rating.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Was easy to setup and worked better than expected. Extremely good quality and while it's easily worth $10, getting it for free was even better.
B00975LE4A|5.0|If you liked Nymphetemine and Godspeed,then this latest release will surely please.Dani's voice sounds great and the songs are heavy and well-written,as always.I can hear bits and pieces of Midian,nymphetamine and Thornography in this collection. Would recommend it if you are a Cradle fan.
B009R659L8|4.0|The book is sweet, wispy and pleasant.  I can always count on Higgins Clark for a well plotted, quick and fun read.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Love John Mayer. One of the only artists where I still REQUIRE buying a physical copy of every cd he puts out.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old Grandson and he loves it.  He's watched it 5 times now.  That frequency is usually only reserved for movies about dogs.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I love the avengers series and was so glad I could rent this with ease from amazon to watch shortly before Iron Man 3 came out.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and we watched it.  I think I enjoyed it more than he did, but it's a great classic and I don't think this will be our last time watching it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like this game because you get to take care of the animals and you have to find new animals
1616551151|5.0|As many of the earlier reviewers have noted, this book is not devoid of errors or \\"ruthlessly fact-checked\\" as the Introduction states. That said, the art in the book is fantastic and truly awe-inspiring. Over two years removed from the last entry in the video game series, this impressive tome had me itching to fire up the old Xbox and dive back into the world of Dragon Age. More a role-playing campaign setting or sourcebook than an art book, there is a plethora of background information and (most of) it is accurate and very well-presented. If you're a fan of the games, or just beautiful art of a fascinating and engrossing story, don't miss out on this book.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|It is a nice mix of remakes and new songs. So easy to just put it on and relax and enjoy his voice.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I purchased this as one part of a complete mount system.  While getting the mototcycle ready for a long road trip, I needed a way to mount the GPS unit and RAM mounts are great for that!  I have previously purchased another RAM mount so I could mount my HD camcorder on the motorcycle and it worked so well I will use RAM mounts for anything I can that I need to mount on my motorcycle.  Unit is small, does not take up a lot of room on the handle bar and because of the design and construction, does not scratch the chrome.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is the best flying,shooting,uni-beaming game in the world. Im so good i have the third highest rank on the globe!!!!
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|I purchased this as one part of a complete mount system.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|All of Patricia Cornell's books are very medically oriented, which I love and always you hanging to the bitter end!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Good solid rock-blues. The Lonely Boys track wiill come up now and then on the radio although if you catch the music video you'll see an older guy dancing to tunes in the parking lot of a hotel. It reflects the music with is basic and gritty.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is good. But why is it 2.3? Every other app store is upgraded to 3.1 .<br />Amazon is behind on everything. They need to catch up. Just saying. Goodbye
B004UHL9EK|4.0|This is one the many applications that I have downloaded since I purchased my Kindle Fire just over 18 months ago. It has come in handy on more than one occasion.
B008602KQI|4.0|I have to tell you that I did expect a little more from this movie since it was so hyped up. So, maybe you should add another star for my jaded point of view. With that being said, I think this movie was very well done in terms of plot, special effects and acting. I watched it to the end and didn't regret \\"spending my hard earned hours and minutes\\" doing so. The future is portrayed in a way that is not beyond belief and not so far fetched that you want to laugh. Instead, the future is extrapolated from our worst nightmares of war, \\"have and have-nots\\" and the oppression of the little people. It is kind of like a hi-tech serfdom. I think you'll like the setting. The characters are well defined and acted out well enough that you forget they are so young. There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested. With that being said....this movie deserves a solid 4 stars....maybe 5.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Put Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons in one picture and it will be good. Add the fact that the novel was written by Robert B Parker it's GREAT! This is exactly how I imagined the characters, the era, the friendship while reading.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I've played Angry Birds on my daughters tablet and had fun. When the Free version was introduced, I thought dealing with a few advertisements would not affect the enjoyment of the game. Boy, was I wrong! Within 5 minutes, I removed the app! Personally, I would not recommend the Advertisement Sponsored version of this game to anyone!
B007U8U1V8|5.0|If you enjoy his previous work, this is like that...only better. A little more bluesy, a little more soulful. Buy it.
0783230079|5.0|Thomas is born at the same moment that four people, all on a speeding bus, die prematurely. The spirits of the four people are trapped with Thomas as he grows up, only to find out later that he is supposed to help them finish that which they had left undone in their lives. Each spirit inhabits Thomas's body, in turn, in order to fulfill their life's wishes.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. shows off his usual amazing skill as an actor, as each very different character inhabits his body. The four spirits, Kyra Sedgewick, Tom Sizemore, Charles Grodin, and Alfre Woodard, all wonderful actors, are amazing in their own performances. This movie is funny and moving and has a wonderful musical score. This is one of my favorite movies starring Robert Downey Jr.!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Very good movie about our history. The acting is speculator and worth watching. I felt it was an accurate portrayal of that period of time.  I watched it twice!
B004P1JEXE|4.0|A book that may disappoint some because it focuses on Kings Landing with the main characters in the background. But for me this was a fascinating story and really develops the characters of Cersei and Jamie, Sam and Brienne.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Finaly able to enjoywhat I have been eating to see without commercials. Be nice if I could watch all sessions and pay one price instead of $ 2.99 each show.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I am always skeptical about &#34;easy to install and use&#34; networking type products but this one really surprised me. It is exactly what it says it is. Installation was a snap and it worked the 1st time without any tweaking. Very nice user interface too. Be sure to read the tutorials as they will help to get you started. The only negative I can see is that it renders fairly slow on my phone and tablet. Considering the utility of this app that is a minor issue.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great design, fantastic sounds and just down right fun.  I have to admit that the graphics are so clear that on the high scenes they do creep me out a bit, but I am afraid of heights.  Great game though.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was a real page turner but also had too much &#34;filler.&#34;  It makes you wonder if a &#34;murder gene&#34; exists. I would recommend the book to those who like murder mysteries and legal thrillers.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I really enjoy the game. I just wished we could just push a button to become friends. It's sometimes hard to do with the whole I'D. We should be able to sell the walls and floor tiles we don't want.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like everything about this series, the intensity, the issues, the drama. Well written, and superbly acted.  It is an intriguing mix of politics, the law, and interesting characters.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|A wonderful story of finding oneself. Pushing to the limit of pain and endurance our true character emerges - what an adventure!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Such sad conditions for people to live in but amazing how humor was around each corner.....loved it! Looking for the next book by this author!
B003QSMC18|5.0|Rented  it for my 5 year old granddaughter to get her to go to bed and it worked and she fell asleep before the end.
B00846REIS|5.0|So much better than 50.  Great characters you can relate to; so easy to get swept away by their story
B000QCS8TW|4.0|An excellent read.  Lots of names to remember, but there is a handy appendix at the back of the book that helps greatly.  Wish the maps were more detailed and a bit larger.
B000FA675C|5.0|It is a thought provoking and entertaining novel.  I like that Dan Brown can make the reader follow the ideas without feeling you must adhere to ideas he is writing about to enjoy the book.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I really this yhis 007...Daniel Craig really seems to embody the Bond I first met in the Ian Fleming books so long ago. Not sure about Moneypenny. I guess we'll see.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun game and does not freeze up.  Nice for situations while waiting.  Lots of levels to keep going each with three levels to complete.  Enough to last plenty of waiting rooms, rides in the car or just for fun.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love the feeling that I own my a city and its free so why not get it I would say a 5 out of 5 like the game and leave a review.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to use and to load the app.  Nice when on the road and need instant updates for the area.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This film was the bomb.  I loved it.  It's cool to think what happens to a game when you're not playing it which is basically what this DVD is about.  \\"No cuts, no buts, no coconuts...\\" After watching the film I went on my computer to play a computer game.  There were a lot of things I enjoyed about this film.  But by the end of the movie Ralph accepts who he is, which I think is a really important thing for everybody today.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The show is funny and our family loves it.  This dvd set just lets us watch it whenever we like.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|I loved the dialogue and it was refreshing without all of the action special effects.  It was about realistic people stuck together.  But the school administrator was too mean, violent and hateful for that kind of position.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is amazing.<br /><br />I have paid upwards for $200 for a gaming mouse, and it was money wasted. They never fit my hand right, or work as I would expect.<br /><br />This Anker Mouse was $39.00 and fits my hand perfectly. Being able to adjust the weight custom only make it even more comfortable. It is very precise, and the cord is protected by a strong braided knit and is very durable.<br /><br />I will definitely look to this company for future PC needs first before looking at other products.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|the movie its great, i didn't read the book but the movie was very good, i think any stephen king fan wold like it.
B0000AUHQF|5.0|One of the very best movies I have ever seen-it was highly recommended to me by several of my friends
B0012GMWCA|5.0|I purchased this CD for one song, but love the whole CD.  Highly recommend if you are a Springsteen fan.
B000AP04KQ|4.0|A very funny movie-I watched it on recommendation of several friends & relatives who found it very funny-ending was hilarious-
B004G606K8|3.0|It's an alright book. I am not the biggest fan of fantasy but I've heard it's good. It's not as bad as I find most fantasy books, but not as good as I was hoping.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The last book was a worthy ending to a great series.  Even though the series flagged a bit from about books 5-10, the first and last 4 books were very good/excellent and made it into a memorable epic.  The characters in the story were memorable. I would recommend this book/series to anyone who enjoys the world of fantasy.
B000W94FIW|5.0|Couldn''t put it down.  Mystical, and a tribute to love between a man and a woman.  i will read more of his books.
B008KW43TE|4.0|Great voice, great sound, truly talented. The range of his voice reminds me of Maxwell. I  enjoyed the entire album!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. I really enjoy it. Have gotten tournaments going with my friends. You should play this game
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|This was a cute and funny story. I will definitely be reading her other Lexy Baker books.  Warning all the talk of bakery items will make you hungry for some sweets!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It holds your interest from page one. Hard to put down. Shocking and thrilling all at once. Highly recommend it.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Robert Downey Jr does it again in his role as Tony Stark - energetic, wise-cracking, and a bit off the wall. Gwyneth Paltrow does the best ever as Pepper Potts. (Among other things, she gets some real action-hero moments.) The villains are truly villainous, and that kid had a great role. The action keeps going to the end, with enough surprises to keep it from being predictable.<br /><br />More than just an effect-fest, though, this has some complexity in at least some of the characters. Stark is forced to face his flaws, vanity in particular, and forced to deal with some very human weakness. In the end, it's not the super-suit that wins the day, it the man and the intelligence that wield the tool. And, if not the most subtle, it reminds everyone, not just scientists, that the best of intentions can be turned to dark purpose. It takes real moral strength and foresight to make sure that doesn't happen.<br /><br />But, at heart, it's just a comic book movie, filled with comic book characters and Roadrunner physics, and I mean that in the very best way.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a great game that is adictive..... lots of fun. More fun than plain solitare. My 92 year old Dad plays it every day!
B00AOB40CY|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Disney movies. I'm glad the classics are being offered on the Kindle devices. Now I can take my favorite Disney movies with me anywhere.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|While this app was fun for the one day it worked, it is now crashing constantly. No amount of troubleshooting works. Don't waste your money.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|A cool intuitive game with good physics. Follow the trails to get three on each level.<br />A good game needing adaptive skills.
B00957T6X6|4.0|Very good book, a bit like the TV show. However it is sometimes a bit too long and depressing to see what it left to read.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This is one of my favorite apps when working correctly. Unfortunately, it crashes every 15-20 seconds on the Kindle Fire with the last update, regardless of whether the app is actually open or not. I have unistalled and. reinstalled...same thing. I will change my rating to 5 stars upon correction of problem.
B002C949KE|5.0|It is a very nice introduction to behavioral economy, even if it is also accessible to anybody without any economics background.
0307346609|5.0|This book presents an interesting perspective.  It is written like a bunch of short stories told by different people around the world during different stages of the zombie war.  I wasn't sure about it at first, but as I kept reading, I really found it interesting.  I really like the deep thought and realistic ideas of how it would play out if something like this happened.  It is a great read!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It must be the simple message about social inequality that made this a phenom.  Simply written at a teen audience.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I always order my season of Gossip Girl after the season and spend a weekend watching it. Sad this is the last one.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Didn't think much of it when I saw but then started playing,WOW! Very cool<br />game very fast paced,graphics good,work great on kindle fire hd,I recommend<br />this game to all,worth the 99¢
B000FBJFSC|5.0|great book i totally enjoyed  it and was happy to see it all worked out great in the end held my interest to the end
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is an engaging story with wonderful characters and colorful descriptions, about life in rural Ireland in the mid-seventies. You will weep for Jamie the boy, and cheer for  Jamie the man.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|This is one of those movies that you are either going to like or you aren't.  It is super quirky but it's a fun movie with some big name actors.  It's funny and the acting is very good.  If you want to watch something light and funny, this is it.
B008PZZFHA|5.0|Favorite part is&#34;you killed Kenny' no they killed Kenny&#34;  it's a awesome movie to watch I love it.  My favorite!!!!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|A great movie and the various methods of digital playing all work well and were easily obtained. I would recommend it.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this app is amazing! I love that you can have more than one weapon. although I wish you could have more than two characters without paying real money. Just as good as Dungeon Hunter 4
B00887490Y|4.0|great story. The twist of the story you will not believe it. I a Jessica fan, so yeah I like the product and her acting
1592332803|5.0|I turn to this book whenever I have a birthday, special dinner, or party to bake for.  We became vegan in 2012 as a family for health reasons.  With this book I simply feel as if I can make anything I would have made in the past.  What I really like is that unlike some other vegan cookbooks this doesn't try to be overly healthy, you won't find black bean brownies in here (I don't think?) - it is more like traditional recipes and how to make them vegan.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|The story is bad. It really isn't worth your money. So don't buy it. Buy something else with your money.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Contains just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you waiting for the next chapter. Didn't want it to end.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I paid for a world pass to continue playing and it was all fine and good until suddenly it disappeared. All the progress I had made, as well as the money I spent, it was all gone. Suffice to say it's an annoyance that I spent real money on an app only for my things to disappear. If this happened as a result of a developer problem please fix it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wasn't sure I'd like the series overall but now I'm hooked!<br />2nd season is a great follow-up to the first.<br />Characters are more developed and relate able...
B0092MKFIY|5.0|The album is both fun and interesting and left me wanting to listen to it with out regret. I would suggest it to any one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is one of the most addictive games I have played. Love the daily . Missions and the daily challenges. Just have to keep going to try and better my friends scores. Nor quite made it yet tho. Love this game!!!!!
B006BXTOFC|3.0|I bought the albums because they where on sale, and found that the black Keys have some real winners and whoa songs that they do with their albums, this one was no different. But there are some good songs on it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Cooper and Lawrence were both very compelling. DeNiro made such a handsome dad I wanted to hug him. \\"You need a strategy.\\" Words to live by.
B003LXSY60|3.0|I first heard the music on a television show and my interest was aroused, I found that I liked some of the songs while others where a little odd for my tastes.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful descriptions and interesting storyline  i am still thinking bout this book  reread parts that were beautifully expressed  have already sent it to a sister in Washington state since the setting is an orchard
B00005JKGK|5.0|No matter what your culture, mothers and daughters of all races and nationalities can identify with the story and characters in this movie.  The book was terrific too, by the way...  I had this movie in my collection as  a cassette, no have added it again as a DVD.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, Reese Witherspoon was great in it.  I would recommend this movie to any one that would enjoy a light comedy.
B009R659L8|5.0|This book was a fast read because it was interesting. The author keeps you wanting more. I cannot wait for her next book.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|In past I have watched and enjoyed many British series and this one also kept its promise of bring gripping and entertaining all through till the end.<br /><br />A nice plot and excellent direction, and since it wsd only 4 episodes, you can watch it over a weekend or do a half day marathon to watch the entire series.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|m<br />Nice game but after I play it 5 or 6 times. and click on the game it keeps returning back to APPS;
B002YCVX5S|4.0|I like Brad Pitt and he was Great, also the story was funny but also showed the Nazi's as the murders that they were.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Im sure my little grandaughter would like it but I havent been able to get it downloaded to my Kindle<br /> Fire Cant figure how to get it downloaded
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was a very good real to life movie that gives you a good feeling and the Actors were Great.
B0007RT9LM|5.0|Unrated version was totally awesome! I would recommend this version. It gets better every time I watch it.  lll lll
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|Kept me interested all the way through. Looking forward to reading the next instalment. Passing the first book on to mum to read.
0670026603|5.0|We discussed this last week and everyone wanted to add their opinion of the characters.  We really understood where each person was coming from and the author gave good detail, except for the father, but we could figure him out.  It was a hard ending, but we understood why it had to happen.
B008P9M614|5.0|I gave this product 5 stars because we love the House series, and this allows us to watch the episodes whenever we want and without commercials. All DVDs work. No issues.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|In my opinion; this was the best one out of all of the step up movies! Still had about the same story line, but I thought the flash mob theme and the dance moves were awesome!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This sharpener is fine as a pocket sharpener to help keep a decent edge on a bladed tool. It will not give you razor sharp edges, but you shouldn't really expect that from an item like this. I use mine on a regular basis and it works fine.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have already gone thru book four and am wondering if there will be a book five and six or will readers be left wondering if Cersie will get her just rewards or punishment and what about Arya and her sister (I've forgotten her name)  and the girl with the Dragons and some of the other players too numerous to mention.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I've read other books about Lincoln but this one topped them all.  The book points out with even more detail that Abraham Lincoln was meant to be President at that time in our history.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great, very addicting. I recommend this game because it's fun if you have nothing to do or you have a young one that likes games!!!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|As the name implies it is a relaxing app. I often can't sleep, and will use this app. You can pick and choose the sounds you wish to hear, and can even set the volume of each item separately, therefore making it your own. I set the timer for 30 minutes and rarely hear it end. Recommend this app to anyone who has a hard time getting to sleep.This was a free app.
B00C0IYPRY|4.0|A great movie teaching real values! Still holds true today. My 14 yr old loved it just as I did 25 years ago.
B00AGKHFCA|3.0|Didn't realize the whole CD was in Italian. There were a few beautiful songs that it didn't matter, they were still good. I wish I knew what he was saying in the other songs. Should do an English version.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I laughed out loud in parts of this story and wept in other parts.  A story of a middle-aged batchelor farmer who's friends have persuaded him to seek companionship through a lonely hearts ad, it is also an indictment of the Catholic Church's orphanage system that was also documented in the Magdalen Laundries.  Written in part with country Irish dialect, it is a delightful story of loss, love and redemption.  Don't pass this one up.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A wonderful moving story, I also couldn't put it down, I flew through it.  It shows one must never give up, their is always a light at the end of the tunnel.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Well written history reads like a novel. Makes scientific and historical account very readable.  Fascinating topic relevant to a wide audience
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Difficult to negotiate.  Have to be really attentive and have to make move before necessary.  I know it supposed to be difficult but way to difficult for the small screen for a reader.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Not what I thought. Focus on time travel versus what if JFK had survived and what the world would look like. However engaging and a page turner
B0086700CM|5.0|East to naivate.  Difficult enough that it does become a habit.  Would recommend this to anyone that might be interested.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Great balance of how to be powerful as a woman without giving up femininity and essential qualities of being a woman
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Poor idea to HAVE to connect to facebook.  My kids will never play this game due to the fact that they do not use facebook!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!  Great book and I was sucked in from the very beginning.  Can't wait for the next book.  Love it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really did not expect the ending.  Heartbreaking, then happy and truly about surviving despite ugly things happening in life!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I'm doubtful about historical accuracy, and there was more than a hint of blaxploitation in this flick, but I sure enjoyed it. Plenty of action, colorful characters to like or sneer at, and excellent scene photography. Jamie Foxx makes a great action hero!
1932100660|5.0|Love this book. Exactly what I was looking for.<br />The best overview regarding healthy eating. You learn about the right food and supplements.<br />Shipping was very fast the price is great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story is intense... Not at all like any other book I have read to date! Excellent read! Loved it!
B008A1B5Z0|1.0|can do the same with task manager and soon as it clears the ram it all starts back up and still have same memory n ram usage its just as essy to bring up task manager end open programs then click ram tab then click clear ram and the background apps stay off were on this app they all restart back so i uninstalled it
0679411585|5.0|Factual.. Hard to put down.  Recommend to anyone.  Very meaningful for we former Cavalrymen.  Easiest 5 Stars I've ever submitted.
B0041KXOVC|1.0|The DVD did not work in USA DVD player. Every time the DVD went into the player to play, immediately opened so it would not play.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|Best for down loading  i like it ,i will recommend it to other if you like to read, amazon have it.
B00AO686MY|3.0|I buzz genre this release, because after 25 years see Roger R in improved quality, I looked spectacular. Latin American and am really hoping that the disc BLU RAY Spanish had the choice. however, the DVD was the only one with this option. My rating is 3 stars, because I am disappointed to see this great film but a better definition Spanish Latino.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|They need to add music to the game. And the one table that includes music eventually goes away as your keep playing.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very addicting. Played for hours already. Can't get enough. Sucks that you have to pay to get good stuff.. still good.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Fan of the book and television show! If you're a fan of the show you must read the books as well they're slightly more intense than ABCfamily's version.
B009R659L8|5.0|Another winner from MHC,a few new twists and turns. I love the NYC background. Looking forward to the next book.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The young Tom Holland brings heart, soul, and courage to his performance.  Much of the emotion in the film is expressed through his reactions.<br /><br />Naomi Watts was also stellar.<br /><br />This was not a sugar-coated account of the tsunami, but rather real, raw, and powerful. Of course, I had to google the real family.  What an amazing story.<br /><br />Makes you want to go and hug all of your loved ones.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I thought it would be more hands-on. The graphics are good, but the game is set up weird and that guy talking to you all the time is a bit annoying. a good game if you are bored and just want to pass some time.
1592332803|5.0|For baking, this is my go-to cookbook! Love the vegan versions of some old favorites, including my birthday cake - red velvet!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|My first book by Morgan Rice.  Though it is an good read, a large compliment of characters and sub-plots was a little hard to get used to.
0805047905|5.0|I have this book memorized!  I give it as part of a welcome baby gift; the clear pictures are great for little ones.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Hands down to another great game by G5. Not only is it fun and keeps your brain constantly thinking about what to do next but, if you play it in the dark alone, it has an awesome scare factor. You won't be disappointed!
B000A2IPPK|5.0|The quality was great and like new. No problem. Good movie. Always fun to watch. Nice to own a copy.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|best movie of 2012. Samuel L Jackson, Leo DiCaprio and Jamie Foxx are hilarious! Violent...but in a fake way :)
